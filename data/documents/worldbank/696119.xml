SRI LANKA&#13;
HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND, ISSUES, AND STRATEGY&#13;
A. Introduction -- Project Context&#13;
1.1        Sri Lanka is different. Although the country is poor, public health achievements stand&#13;
out as an impressive success story: life expectancy of more than 72 years, infant mortality below 20&#13;
per thousand births, fertility near replacement level, and a population growth rate of less than 1% per&#13;
annum and falling. Additionally, literacy is almost universal, for females as well as males. Such&#13;
demographic, health and education indicators are usually associated with much wealthier, developed&#13;
countries.&#13;
1.2        Nevertheless, several public health issues typical of developing countries remain. There&#13;
has been a resurgence of malaria in recent years, and a third of children under five are malnourished.&#13;
And, as in the rest of Asia, HIV/AIDS poses the threat of epidemic spread. Programs to address these&#13;
three public health priorities comprise essential elements of any package of basic health services.&#13;
1.3        Additionally, the aging of the population is associated with major changes in the disease&#13;
pattern of the population as non-communicable chronic and degenerative diseases of adults become&#13;
dominant. Thus, Sri Lanka has a unique dual morbidity profile that includes both persistent&#13;
developing country MCH morbidity problems and adult disease patterns that reflect a well-advanced&#13;
epidemiological transition.&#13;
1.4        The Government of Sri Lanka has requested IDA to finance a Health Services Project, to&#13;
consolidate and expand assistance provided through the IDA-supported Health &amp; Family Planning&#13;
project that closed in September 1995, as well as to move ahead to new issues and challenges.&#13;
Specifically, the Government has requested assistance for its malaria, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS&#13;
programs that address the country's priority public health issues. The project will also help the&#13;
Government to identify the dimensions of the expanding burden of non-communicable diseases of&#13;
adults and will support a pilot effort to develop cost-effective approaches to their prevention and&#13;
treatment.&#13;
1.5        Sri Lanka's health services developed when the focus was on prevention of infectious&#13;
and communicable diseases. The changing disease pattern resulting from the success of these efforts,&#13;
combined with increasingly constrained public resources and the growth of the private health sector,&#13;
have raised basic questions of health policy, particularly in the areas of resource allocation in the&#13;
sector, resource mobilization, and the role of the private sector. The Government recognizes that such&#13;
policy issues must be addressed. The project will provide a framework that will facilitate the&#13;
Government's efforts to approach policy concerns systematically, through improved planning capacity,&#13;
studies, pilot initiatives and a continuing dialogue.&#13;
B. Background -- Economic and Social Setting&#13;
1.6        Sri Lanka has made progress in reducing the incidence of poverty, reflected in&#13;
improvements in human development indicators as well as in consumption. This progress is due to a&#13;
combination of three factors: (i) public provision of basic preventive and curative health services as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
well as education services, which have achieved excellent results; (ii) income transfer programs that&#13;
have enabled higher consumption by the poor; and (iii) a relatively good long-term growth&#13;
performance, with real per capita GDP growth of about 2.5% per year on average for the period 1950-&#13;
93.1/&#13;
1.7        However, Sri Lanka is still a low-income economy. Although its long-term growth rate&#13;
in per capita terms compares favorably with most of the developing world, it falls well short of the&#13;
growth rate achieved in the last three decades by the high-performing East Asian economies. The&#13;
main reason for this lag is that Sri Lanka's policies have been less supportive of economic growth.&#13;
Problems with macroeconomic management have constrained domestic saving and investment and&#13;
fueled inflation; export growth has been constrained by inward looking trade policies, interventions in&#13;
the labor market, and, at times in the past, exchange rate overvaluation; and the agriculture sector's&#13;
performance has been constrained by pervasive controls on land ownership and use, marketing and&#13;
pricing. Civil strife in the northern and eastern regions has also constrained economic growth.&#13;
1.8        In household and individual terms, substantial poverty remains. A recent World Bank&#13;
Poverty Assessment for Sri Lanka estimated that the proportion of individuals with consumption&#13;
expenditure below the poverty line was about 22% in 1990. Poverty is still widespread in Sri Lanka,&#13;
with the proportion of total consumption expenditure accounted for by food, excluding consumer&#13;
durables, declining steadily from about 80% for the poorest group to about 40% for the richest. The&#13;
poor devote more than three-quarters of their total budget to food, with rice, the most important item,&#13;
accounting for about one fourth of their total expenditure.&#13;
C. Population, Health and Nutrition Sector Status&#13;
Population&#13;
1.9        The demographic transition in Sri Lanka, now virtually complete, followed the classic&#13;
pattern of initial mortality decline and subsequent fertility decline. From a life expectancy of about 43&#13;
years in 1945, death rates have fallen rapidly to developed country levels as the result of the near&#13;
eradication of malaria, extension of effective health services in the rural areas, and improved nutrition.&#13;
The excess female mortality characteristic of South Asia has been reversed, and female life expectancy&#13;
is now about five years higher than male, as is typical of developed countries. Maternal mortality has&#13;
also been reduced to developed country levels. The decline in fertility to replacement level (total&#13;
fertility rate of about 2.2 in 1995) has been due in some measure to rising age at marriage but largely&#13;
reflects declines in marital fertility due to a vigorous family planning program, widespread female&#13;
education, and improved child health. Significantly, prevalence of modern contraceptive measures in&#13;
1993 was only 44%, with traditional methods accounting for another 22%. This indicates the high&#13;
demand for family limitation that has been generated as well as impressive ability to use traditional&#13;
contraception effectively, both of which are linked to the high educational levels. The present&#13;
population of about 18 million is expected to stabilize at approximately 25 million in about 2025.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
Health&#13;
1.10       Mortality declines, led by the reduction of infant mortality to developed country levels,&#13;
have been achieved through good implementation of immunization programs and an effective primary&#13;
health care system. Sri Lanka has made excellent progress in the prevention and control of infectious&#13;
and communicable diseases including tuberculosis and leprosy. However, preventable morbidity in&#13;
young children, due to diarrheal and respiratory diseases linked to malnutrition, has not been&#13;
completely eliminated. The major remaining communicable disease is the age-old scourge of malaria.&#13;
HIV/AIDS has recently emerged as a new threat, although HIV prevalence is still low.&#13;
1.11       DDT spraying virtually eliminated malaria in Sri Lanka in the early 1960s. However,&#13;
after use of DDT was curtailed there were several resurgences, most recently in 1987 and 1991, when&#13;
the number of cases was probably at least as high as 1.3 million and 800,000, respectively, and&#13;
malaria was declared to be Sri Lanka's major public health problem. It is particularly acute in the dry&#13;
zone, where most of the country's agriculture is concentrated. Rates are highest in children but are&#13;
also high for adults, so that epidemic outbreaks disrupt both schooling and agricultural activities. By&#13;
1995, the epidemic levels of 1991 had been reduced by about a third. This can be attributed in large&#13;
measure to the introduction of a revised malaria control strategy in 1993, but it is likely that variations&#13;
in rainfall and the natural progression of the epidemic cycle were also factors.&#13;
1.12       The first case of AIDS was identified in Sri Lanka in 1987. As of January 1996, a total&#13;
of 171 HIV-positive individuals had been identified, 146 Sri Lankans and 25 foreigners. Of these, 58&#13;
cases had progressed to AIDS and there had been 49 deaths. It is estimated that by 2000 transmission&#13;
will be almost entirely heterosexual. The true prevalence of HIV is not known; current estimates vary&#13;
from 500 to 5,000. However, it is generally agreed that, as in a number of other Asian countries,&#13;
epidemic spread of HIV has not begun in Sri Lanka. In fact, there are a number of factors which&#13;
suggest that, given the cultural setting and the high educational levels, if present preventive and&#13;
educational efforts are continued and strengthened, epidemic spread of the virus in Sri Lanka may be&#13;
prevented. While complacency must be avoided, Sri Lanka's prospects for avoiding an epidemic&#13;
appear to be encouraging if appropriate steps are taken now.&#13;
1.13       Fertility decline coupled with increasing life expectancy means that the population of Sri&#13;
Lanka is aging: while the number of children under five is declining, the number of adults over 60 is&#13;
expected to increase from 1.6 million in 1995 to 2.0 million in 2005. This is resulting in an&#13;
epidemiological transition, that is, a major shift in the disease pattern of the population as non-&#13;
communicable diseases of adults become dominant. Communicable diseases now contribute only a&#13;
small part of the total disease burden, a reflection of the good job that Sri Lanka has done in&#13;
providing health care and controlling these diseases, for example through immunization. Currently,&#13;
most of the disease burden comes from non-communicable and degenerative diseases of adults&#13;
(cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory conditions; diabetes; cancers). However, the&#13;
prevalence of non-communicable diseases and associated risk factors in the population at present is in&#13;
many instances uncertain.&#13;
Nutrition&#13;
1.14       Recent data on nutritional status in Sri Lanka indicate that about a third of children under&#13;
age 5 are malnourished, that is, underweight in terms of weight for age, a surprising level of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
malnourishment in a country where literacy rates are high and infant mortality and fertility have been&#13;
reduced to developed country levels. While to some extent, malnutrition reflects the persistence of&#13;
poverty in Sri Lanka, there are also significant levels of malnourishment at higher socio-economic&#13;
levels where food availability is clearly not a constraint. Linked to malnutrition at all socio-economic&#13;
levels are socio-cultural factors resulting in inappropriate breast-feeding and weaning practices that in&#13;
turn lead to the failure of a child to thrive. Once growth begins to falter, it becomes progressively&#13;
more difficult for the child to return to the right track, particularly because the child becomes&#13;
increasingly vulnerable to diarrheal and respiratory infections. However, due to Sri Lanka's excellent&#13;
health system, these diseases are no longer a significant cause of mortality.&#13;
I.15       Micronutrient deficiencies are also present in Sri Lanka. A goiter survey in 1987&#13;
indicated that iodine deficiency is a public health problem throughout the wet zone, and it is estimated&#13;
that more than 60% of the total population may be at risk of iodine deficiency. Iron deficiency&#13;
anemia is also prevalent in Sri Lanka, particularly among pregnant women and pre-school children.&#13;
D. Sector Issues and Constraints&#13;
Program and Policy Development&#13;
1.16       At the direction of the present Government, the Ministry of Health has prepared a&#13;
'Perspective Plan for Health Development in Sri Lanka 1995-2000.' The Plan draws on the 'National&#13;
Health Policy Sri Lanka' (1992) of the previous government, and the two documents have many&#13;
similarities. However, the previous govemment took few steps to implement the recommendations of&#13;
the 1992 Health Policy. The present Government also intends to issue a new statement of its health&#13;
policy, although it is not expected to differ greatly from that of the previous government.&#13;
1.17       The Perspective Plan specifies five major goals for Sri Lanka's health policy in the next&#13;
decade: (i) prevention and control of communicable and non-communicable diseases; (ii) promotion of&#13;
health and fostering of healthy life styles; (iii) human resource development in the public and private&#13;
sectors; (iv) improvement of availability and quality of health services; and (v) decentralization of&#13;
health administration. Like many such policy documents, the Perspective Plan covers all areas of&#13;
concern to the Ministry of Health and enumerates many policies to be implemented, but it indicates&#13;
neither priorities nor, in most instances, mechanisms for moving from policy to planning and&#13;
implementation. The Ministry's ability to carry out policy development and planning have benefitted&#13;
from assistance provided through the recent IDA-financed Health &amp; Family Planning Project but&#13;
requires additional strengthening. Weaknesses in these areas, and additionally in health economics and&#13;
financing, where the Ministry has virtually no capacity, remain issues of concern.&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
1.18       The Public Sector. The Government of Sri Lanka provides free health care services to&#13;
all citizens through well-developed primary health care and hospital systems. With the implementation&#13;
of the Provincial Councils Act in 1989, the health services were decentralized and responsibility for&#13;
most health facilities and provision of most health services was devolved to the provincial Departments&#13;
of Health. The Ministry of Health remains responsible for policy, relations with UN and bilateral&#13;
agencies, medical and para-medical education, teaching hospitals, medical institutions providing special&#13;
care, and the bulk purchase of pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
1.19        With the creation of divisional secretariats and the post of Divisional Director of Health&#13;
Services (DDHS) in 1992, the health services were further decentralized. Under the decentralized&#13;
scheme, responsibility for comprehensive health care at community and divisional levels as well as&#13;
administrative authority over the curative institutions in the division was devolved to the DDHS. The&#13;
DDHS is therefore responsible for all promotional and preventive health activities in a division, which&#13;
has a population on average of 60,000-80,000, and must coordinate the functioning of the preventive&#13;
and curative services, which have developed separately.&#13;
1.20        Decentralization was implemented and expanded without adequate planning or resources,&#13;
and the financial and administrative implications are still in the process of being worked out.&#13;
Decentralization to the DDHS level, in particular devolution of financial powers, has not been fully&#13;
implemented. It is intended that ultimately the provinces will support their health services through&#13;
their own revenues, but in practice the provincial Health Departments have been financed largely&#13;
through block grants from the central Ministry of Health. These funds are not earmarked for&#13;
particular purposes or programs. The provinces have not been consistent about reporting on their&#13;
utilization to the Ministry, and there is a question as to whether they are under any constitutional&#13;
obligation to do so.&#13;
1.21        While in theory decentralization could make significant contributions to the efficiency&#13;
and effectiveness of the health services, the actual consequences are still far from clear. Planning and&#13;
management capacities in the provincial Health Departments are weak, nor do they have the resources&#13;
to support needed staff and infrastructure for the divisional directorates; what has been done in this&#13;
regard has been supported largely by extemal assistance. The provision of the resources required to&#13;
support effective functioning of the decentralized health services is a major issue for the Government.&#13;
1.22        An additional unresolved issue concerns the provision of health services to&#13;
underprivileged estate populations.2/ The Ministry of Health has indicated that it intends to take&#13;
direct control of estate medical facilities and integrate their management and staff into the existing&#13;
system, a measure recommended by the World Bank's recent poverty assessment for Sri Lanka.&#13;
However, a plan of action has not yet been developed.&#13;
1.23        The Private Sector--for Profit. Although most hospital facilities in Sri Lanka are public,&#13;
the provision of private outpatient care has expanded rapidly in recent years. In 1986/87, private&#13;
expenditures for health-related goods and services represented close to 40% of overall national health&#13;
expenditures, and by 1992 the private sector provided over 50% of outpatient care. These trends,&#13;
combined with current public sector resource constraints and changing epidemiological patterns,&#13;
suggest that the public sector should focus on preventive care, support of services for the poor, health&#13;
education, and communicable disease control, leaving to the private sector the curative services that&#13;
are of most interest to them. A number of key steps are needed to further facilitate expanded private&#13;
sector participation. These include provision of a regulatory framework and a supportive climate for&#13;
private investment, both domestic and external, in health services. Additionally, efforts to encourage&#13;
the private sector should be linked to exploration of health insurance options. While these points are&#13;
2/ Workers on tea estates, most of whom are of south Indian origin, comprise approximately 5% of&#13;
the population of Sri Lanka.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
included in recent policy documents, concerted measures by Government to implement them are&#13;
needed.&#13;
1.24       The Private Sector--Non-Profit. Sri Lanka has a strong NGO sector that plays an&#13;
important role in a variety of development and community-oriented programs, which often include&#13;
health and nutrition activities. There are several large organizations, notably the Sarvodaya Rural&#13;
Enterprise Program and the Woman's Development Federation, which are island-wide in terms of their&#13;
coverage, but most NGOs are locally based and active only in their own areas. The extent of NGO&#13;
activity and potential in Sri Lanka is illustrated by the large number of NGOs, probably more than a&#13;
hundred, that are active in AIDS work or were interested in becoming so. Coordination between&#13;
government health programs and NGO activities at local levels is often weak, although when it does&#13;
occur both public and NGO programs are strengthened at minimal cost. The Ministry of Health could&#13;
assist the situation by clarifying its intention to improve NGO coordination and cooperation and&#13;
systematically reviewing the situation of individual programs.&#13;
Service Provision&#13;
1.25       Provision of services through effective hospital and primary health care systems has been&#13;
the strength of public health care in Sri Lanka. Both systems, however, have come under increasing&#13;
stress in recent years, and sustaining their capacity to provide quality services will require adequate&#13;
resources and policy initiatives to respond to changing circumstances. Major issues include the&#13;
overcrowding of tertiary hospitals, insufficient community outreach, and the erosion of the service&#13;
ethic that has sustained the public provision of health care in Sri Lanka for many years.&#13;
1.26       The hospital system faces substantial efficiency problems, most clearly reflected in the&#13;
"by-passing" phenomenon, that is, tertiary care hospitals are overcrowded while secondary and primary&#13;
facilities are underutilized, reflecting the more experienced staff and better availability of drugs at&#13;
major hospitals. Local maternity homes in particular go virtually unutilized, because women prefer to&#13;
deliver at facilities where a doctor is available.&#13;
1.27       Primary health care achievements have been based on the availability of facility care at&#13;
divisional level, referral to higher level hospitals, and twice monthly maternal-child health (MCH)&#13;
clinics organized in the community at the most convenient location available (Annex 2). MCH clinics&#13;
are conducted by several public health midwives (PHMs) from the area and the divisional-level doctor&#13;
(DDHS). Although community outreach (that is, visiting households in the community, particularly&#13;
those with pregnant women, newborns and young children) is part of the job description of PHMs,&#13;
outreach is often inadequate, because PHMs are unable to find housing in the communities to which&#13;
they are assigned and transportation is difficult. To improve this situation, a strengthened model for&#13;
primary health care has been adopted which calls for the construction of village (gramodaya) health&#13;
centers (GHCs) that combine living quarters for PHMs and clinic space. Where GHCs have been&#13;
constructed, the resident PHMs report that their coverage and general effectiveness have improved&#13;
many fold. Preventive and promotive health services provided by paramedical workers resident in the&#13;
community is a more cost-effective service delivery strategy than reliance on health facilities, and it&#13;
will become increasingly so as life expectancy continues to rise and care for the elderly at home&#13;
becomes widespread. However, the GHC model requires considerable resources, and thus far only&#13;
about 20% of PHMs have purpose-built facilities, mostly financed by external assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.28       There is remarkable consensus that the basic challenge to sustaining Sri Lanka's public&#13;
health achievements stems from erosion of the "ethic of service" that has supported the public health&#13;
system for many years. Typically, medical officers and field staff have worked conscientiously in&#13;
poor, often appalling, conditions, and yet have managed to achieve excellent results. It is unrealistic&#13;
to expect that, given rising expectations and increasing economic pressures, the quality of the system&#13;
can be maintained indefinitely without additional resources.&#13;
Staffing and Training&#13;
1.29       A shortage of physicians in the late 1980s resulting from unsettled conditions in several&#13;
areas of the country and consequent disruption of medical education has been rectified. However, the&#13;
creation of the post of Divisional Director of Health Services (DDHS) as part of the decentralization&#13;
of the health services, which substantially increased the number of government postings in rural areas,&#13;
has raised several related issues.&#13;
1.30       DDHS posts are being filled to a large extent by new medical graduates, who lack&#13;
requisite administrative and MCH experience and are often dissatisfied with rural postings. It is&#13;
reported that it has now become common for DDHS doctors to conduct an after-hours private practice&#13;
as well. It is generally recognized that new graduates appointed to DDHS posts should receive MCH&#13;
and management training before being allowed to take up their posts. The IDA-assisted Health &amp;&#13;
Family Planning Project supported the development of a management training course for DDHSs,&#13;
which the Ministry is continuing. However, there has been too little effort to relate course content to&#13;
the actual problems faced by DDHS doctors or to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. Informal&#13;
feedback indicates a high level of frustration because of the difficulty of applying what is taught given&#13;
the resource constraints that confront most DDHS doctors, as well as a need for more technical MCH&#13;
training.&#13;
Expenditure and Financing&#13;
1.31       Public sector health expenditure for 1990-94 was about 1.6% of GNP (Annex 9). This is&#13;
about average for most south and east Asian countries. In real terms, health expenditure has risen&#13;
about 135% over the last 15 years. The increase is due primarily to substantial capital investment in&#13;
tertiary hospitals at several points over the period. While the growth of investment undoubtedly&#13;
reflects changing epidemiological patterns, it has been based on little systematic analysis of needs. As&#13;
could be expected under such circumstances, expenditure on recurrent costs, although also rising over&#13;
the period, has not kept pace with investment. New tertiary facilities have tended to absorb increased&#13;
recurrent expenditures, while recurrent budgets for primary and secondary facilities have become&#13;
increasingly inadequate.&#13;
1.32       The epidemiological transition underway in Sri Lanka has major implications for health&#13;
expenditure. The pressures for additional spending on health care are likely to increase as chronic and&#13;
degenerative diseases become more important, because these diseases cost more to treat and require&#13;
longer term care than the relatively simple diseases of childhood. The complexity of health care&#13;
services required will increase considerably; health personnel will need to be more highly qualified&#13;
and more specialized, and the technology for diagnosis and treatment will become more sophisticated.&#13;
The greatest effect will be seen in increased demand for hospital bed capacity. In sum, the more&#13;
expensive mix of interventions implied by the epidemiological transition will put increasing pressure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
on government health resources, and the cost of providing for the health care needs of the population&#13;
will rise. If the enhanced needs for health services are translated into effective demand, total health&#13;
expenditure (public plus private) would rise considerably in real terms and as a percentage of GDP, as&#13;
has happened in developed countries. The prospects, therefore, are that public sector health&#13;
expenditure as a percentage of GDP is likely to rise, unless the private sector assumes greater&#13;
responsibility. Financial sustainability is thus emerging as a key issue.&#13;
E. Sector Development Strategy&#13;
Government Strategy&#13;
1.33       As reflected in the new Perspective Plan (para 1.16), the Government is aware that&#13;
measures to address increasingly constrained public resources and the changing disease burden&#13;
resulting from the epidemiological transition are now required. Five key strategies have been&#13;
identified: (i) improving equity through concentrating on underprivileged and underserved groups; (ii)&#13;
making better use of existing resources through improvements in the efficiency of services and&#13;
accountability of management; (iii) strengthening community participation; (iv) developing managerial&#13;
and information systems; and (v) promoting private sector (both for-profit and NGO) involvement in&#13;
service delivery. These steps would promote efficiency and help limit demands for public financing of&#13;
health care. But more needs to be done, and the Government is exploring possibilities.&#13;
1.34       In the politically sensitive area of cost recovery, the Government is extremely cautious.&#13;
This must be seen in the light of the strong public health sector in Sri Lanka and the belief, strongly&#13;
held by many, that the state has a moral obligation to provide free health and education services.&#13;
Consistent with this context, the Government's current proposals for cost recovery are limited.&#13;
Nevertheless, the Government intends to expand pay wards in tertiary and secondary hospitals and to&#13;
study other possible cost recovery measures.&#13;
1.35       The Government's private sector strategy is much broader. To protect the public interest,&#13;
a regulatory framework for private medical practitioners is in the process of enactment. To encourage&#13;
private sector growth, Government proposes, among other steps, to: make provision for concessional&#13;
loans for establishment of private practices, especially in rural areas; lease available spare capacity in&#13;
public sector facilities to private practitioners; permit foreign providers of private medical care to&#13;
operate in Sri Lanka; and encourage the development of private health insurance.&#13;
IDA's Strategy and Role&#13;
1.36       The project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka,&#13;
discussed by the Board on June 13, 1996, which indicates that IDA expects to respond to Government&#13;
requests for assistance in addressing key public health issues through the project. IDA's health sector&#13;
strategy in Sri Lanka has two complementary goals: to support Government's efforts to sustain&#13;
present achievements; and to assist Government to move beyond the undoubted accomplishments of&#13;
the health services to address "second generation" issues concerning resource allocation in the public&#13;
health sector, efficiency and effectiveness of the health services, financial sustainability, and the&#13;
private sector. These concerns must be given priority in view of the well-advanced epidemiological&#13;
transition in Sri Lanka as well as increasing pressures on scarce public resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9-&#13;
1.37       IDA's comparative advantage is based on the ability to bring to bear relevant cross-&#13;
country experience in the health sector, particularly in the areas of helping Government to assess&#13;
priorities within the sector, develop more cost-effective ways of providing health care, and explore&#13;
issues relating to sustainability and non-government options for delivering health care. In anticipation&#13;
of the need for data and analysis addressing health policy questions, the recently completed IDA-&#13;
supported Health &amp; Family Planning Project included a major Health Strategy and Financing Study.&#13;
Drawing on the study's recommendations, which are by and large consistent with those of the&#13;
Government's Perspective Plan (para. 1.16), IDA has initiated policy discussions with the Ministry of&#13;
Health as part of project preparation. The result has been an agreed program of studies and initiatives&#13;
to be carried out as part of the project, supported by an annual review to carry the process forward&#13;
(para. 2.66; Annex 6). Improved quality and efficiency of the health services, generation of additional&#13;
resources for tertiary care, and achievement of an appropriate public-private mix in the health sector&#13;
are among the first areas that will be addressed.&#13;
External Support&#13;
1.38       WHO has a long-standing relationship with the Ministry of Health and provides technical&#13;
assistance and other support to many of the Ministry's programs. UNICEF and UNFPA provide&#13;
assistance to the Ministry's MCH and family planning programs, respectively. These donors, together&#13;
with UNDP, USAID, and NORAD, have sustained the AIDS control program since its inception.&#13;
However, assistance from UN and bilateral sources is expected to be substantially reduced in the&#13;
coming years, and these agencies have cooperated fully in project preparation. In addition to IDA, the&#13;
Asian Development Bank (ADB) is also a major source of loan support for the health sector. ADB&#13;
currently supports a health project that concentrates on health facilities at primary and secondary&#13;
levels. The content of the IDA-supported project has been discussed with ADB, and care has been&#13;
taken to ensure that the two are complementary. IDA is therefore in a favorable position to assist&#13;
Government with donor coordination and to act as the lender of last resort.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
1.39       The only IDA-assisted social sector project that has been completed in Sri Lanka is the&#13;
Health &amp; Family Project (Cr. 1903-LK), which closed on September 30, 1995. This project&#13;
experienced major implementation difficulties in its early phases, due primarily to lack of "ownership"&#13;
by the implementing ministry and poor project management. After a very critical mid-term review by&#13;
the Borrower, project management was modified and implementation improved substantially. On the&#13;
basis of this and other country experience in the social sectors, the following lessons can be drawn:&#13;
(i) the politically sensitive nature of many aspects of health policy, given the widely held view that the&#13;
state has a moral obligation to provide free health and education services to all citizens; (ii) the&#13;
importance of "ownership" of a project by the ministry responsible for implementation; (iii) the need&#13;
to ensure that senior program managers understand and support the strategies underlying project&#13;
assistance to specific programs; (iv) the crucial role of project management in coordinating project&#13;
activities and monitoring progress; (v) the useful role that a thorough mid-term review carried out by&#13;
the Borrower can play; (vi) the need to ensure that Bank practices and procedures are understood by&#13;
those responsible for project management by the time the project becomes effective; and (vii) the&#13;
importance of drawing on regional and international experience to strengthen project and program&#13;
design. The preparation team drew on experience in other countries to help the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Government identify cost-effective strategies in the nutrition and STD/AIDS areas, and the pilot NCD&#13;
effort is expected to make extensive use of developed country experience in developing NCD options.&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives and Summary Description&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
2.1        The objectives of the project are to strengthen Government's ability to address (i)&#13;
remaining major public health problems (malaria, malnutrition and HIV/AIDS); (ii) new challenges&#13;
raised by the epidemiological transition and the increasing importance of non-communicable diseases&#13;
of adults; and (iii) key health policy and financing issues.&#13;
Summary Description&#13;
2.2        To achieve these objectives, the project will comprise the components described in the&#13;
following paragraphs.&#13;
2.3        The malaria component will support expanded implementation of WHO's revised&#13;
malaria strategy, focusing on six high-prevalence districts. The revised strategy emphasizes the cost-&#13;
effective options of personal protection through use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, prompt&#13;
diagnosis and treatment for suspected cases, and the substitution of selected residual spraying for&#13;
widespread spraying. Mobile clinics for immediate diagnosis and treatment will be phased out when&#13;
prevalence falls below specified thresholds. Initial implementation of the revised strategy, which has&#13;
reduced the amount of insecticide used by some 65%, appears to have achieved good results. The&#13;
annual incidence of malaria cases in the six high-prevalence districts is expected to fall from more&#13;
than 40 detected cases per thousand population in 1994 to less than 10 per thousand by 2001; this&#13;
would mean 125,000 fewer detected cases in 2001 as compared to 1994.&#13;
2.4        The STD/AIDS component will support the -efforts of the National STD/AIDS Control&#13;
Program (NSACP) to prevent the epidemic spread of HIV in Sri Lanka. The program has moved&#13;
promptly to take the medical and educational steps necessary to contain HIV. A major focus will be&#13;
improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of STDs in both public and private sectors, since STD&#13;
cases are a major HIV risk group. Education/communication efforts to promote knowledge of STDs&#13;
and HIV/AIDS and avoidance of high-risk behaviors will continue to be carried out by NGOs with&#13;
external support parallel to the project. If present efforts are expanded and strengthened, it may be&#13;
possible for Sri Lanka to avoid an AIDS epidemic and remain a low HIV-prevalence country.&#13;
2.5        The nutrition component will support the reorientation of the Health Ministry's existing&#13;
clinic-based growth monitoring program to a community-based growth promotion program utilizing&#13;
NGOs and community volunteers. This shift results from examination of altemative approaches in Sri&#13;
Lanka and elsewhere. Since inappropriate breast-feeding, weaning and feeding practices rather than&#13;
food availability constraints underlie much of infant and young child malnutrition, the program will&#13;
focus on reaching pregnant women and mothers to promote behavior change. Micronutrient&#13;
deficiencies (iron and iodine) will also be addressed. The percentage of malnourished children below&#13;
age 5, which was about one third, or more than 500,000 infants and children, in 1993, is expected to&#13;
be reduced to less than 20% by 2001, The percentage of low-weight births, which was about 20%, or&#13;
roughly 80,000 newboms, in 1993, is expected to be reduced to less than 15% by 2001. Iodine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
deficiency is expected to be virtually eliminated and iron-deficiency anemia significantly reduced by&#13;
2001.&#13;
2.6        The pilot non-communicable diseases component will support an effort to identify the&#13;
dimensions of non-communicable diseases in Sri Lanka and develop cost-effective strategies for&#13;
prevention and treatment.&#13;
2.7        The program support component comprises three subcomponents. A health policy&#13;
component will support strengthening and institutionalization of Government's currently weak capacity&#13;
for policy analysis and planning in the health sector. It will assist Government to address issues&#13;
conceming efficiency and effectiveness of health services; resource mobilization; financial&#13;
sustainability; and the role of the private sector. It will include an agreed program of policy-related&#13;
studies and linked pilot initiatives. A management information systems component will support&#13;
increased capacity of MOH to organize, analyze and utilize information for management and planning&#13;
purposes. A health education component will support enhanced quality, effectiveness and coverage&#13;
of health education activities coordinated by the Ministry's Health Education Bureau (HEB) as well as&#13;
improved ability of the HEB to carry out an expanded program of training in interpersonal&#13;
communication.&#13;
B. Detailed Project Description&#13;
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND NUTRITION&#13;
Malaria Component (US$3.6 million; 17% of base costs)&#13;
2.8        Background. In the aftermath of the recent resurgence of malaria in 1991 (para. 1.11,&#13;
Annex 3), in order to strengthen the Ministry of Health's Anti-Malaria Campaign (AMC) a decision&#13;
was taken to adopt WHO's revised Global Malaria Control Strategy. Funds from the IDA-supported&#13;
Health and Family Planning Project (Cr 1903-CE) were made available from 1993 to support the&#13;
revised strategy in four of six high-prevalence districts (Matale, Polunnaruwa, Kurunegala and&#13;
Anuradhapura). By 1994, the epidemic levels of 1991 had been reduced by about a third and&#13;
continued to decline through 1995. The decline in the incidence of malaria since the introduction of&#13;
the new strategy is encouraging. However, it is likely that variations in rainfall and the natural&#13;
epidemic cycle have also been factors.&#13;
2.9        Objectives. The objective of the Anti-Malaria Campaign is to sustain and increase&#13;
recent reductions in the incidence of malaria in an environmentally acceptable manner. Specifically,&#13;
the goal is to reduce the annual incidence of malaria in the high-prevalence districts from more than&#13;
40 detected cases per thousand population in 1994 to less than 10 per thousand by the end of the&#13;
project period. Once this level is achieved, the program can be sustained on a maintenance basis and&#13;
resource requirements will be considerably reduced.&#13;
2.10       Strategies. The revised WHO strategy adopted in 1993 includes: (i) early detection and&#13;
prompt treatment of malaria cases; (ii) selective application of sustainable malaria control measures&#13;
including vector control; (iii) development of mechanisms to forecast/prevent malaria epidemics and&#13;
outbreaks; and (iv) regular assessment of the implementation and impact of the program. In&#13;
consequence, the focus of the program has shifted: there is now much less emphasis on spraying with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
insecticides and more stress on protective measures and treatment through insecticide-impregnated bed&#13;
nets, mobile clinics, and better diagnosis and treatment at health facilities. The change in the spraying&#13;
program has been dramatic. Since 1993, two new insecticides have been introduced in addition to the&#13;
malathion previously used in order to minimize development of resistance, and the amount of&#13;
insecticide used has been reduced by 65%. Coverage of targeted houses has improved, since the new&#13;
insecticides are more acceptable than malathion.&#13;
2.11       Content. The project will provide continued support of the revised AMC program&#13;
nationally as well as expansion of support to the two remaining high-prevalence districts (Puttalam and&#13;
Moneragala). Program content that will be supported by the project is summarized below; details are&#13;
given in Annex 3.&#13;
(a)   Program management--improved coordination among regional (district) malaria offices&#13;
and the AMC Directorate; preparation of annual district plans incorporating annual&#13;
targets; computerization of data collation and analysis at district level supported by&#13;
training and improved data reporting to the AMC.&#13;
(b)   Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of malaria cases--mobile clinics to take blood films&#13;
from all fever cases in a local area, diagnose malaria on the spot and provide immediate&#13;
treatment; recruitment and training of microscopists to be posted to medical facilities,&#13;
thus reducing the level of presumptive treatment; improved identification and follow up&#13;
of drug-resistant cases; training of field health staff to enable their expanded participation&#13;
in malaria control activities at the community level. Project support for ambulances for&#13;
transport of falciparum malaria cases and other medical emergencies would be&#13;
conditional on a review of transport aspects of the health system that would indicate the&#13;
justification in cost-effectiveness terms for the type and number of vehicles needed and&#13;
address sustainability issues.&#13;
(c)   Selected and sustainable malaria control methods--strengthening of entomological and&#13;
parasitological surveillance; improved targeting of house spraying through better&#13;
parasitological and entomological parameters; expansion of the impregnated bed net&#13;
program.&#13;
(d)   Regular assessment of malaria status and prevention of epidemics--improved tracking of&#13;
drug resistance; regular prevalence surveys; establishment of an early warning system for&#13;
potential malaria epidemics based on entomological, parasitological, epidemiological and&#13;
climatic data.&#13;
(e)   Community awareness and particivation--program orientation for NGO/community&#13;
volunteers; educational activities focused at the community level emphasizing use of&#13;
impregnated bed nets and the importance of seeking diagnosis and treatment for fever, to&#13;
be coordinated by the Ministry of Health's Health Education Bureau and the provincial&#13;
health education units.&#13;
(f)   Operational research--small-scale trials of additional physical and biological controls to&#13;
expand vector control while minimizing environmental risk; other applied research as&#13;
appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
2.12       The AMC program receives limited support from WHO in the form of technical&#13;
assistance. Project support for the activities indicated above will allow the AMC to complete&#13;
introduction of the revised WHO strategy nationally and especially in the high-prevalence districts.&#13;
2.13       lnputs. The project will support equipment, computers, vehicles, in-service training,&#13;
information, education and communication (IEC) activities and materials, and incremental operating&#13;
costs including insecticide for the treatment of bed nets.&#13;
2.14       Monitoring. The AMC monitors a set of program indicators on a monthly and annual&#13;
basis, including the number and results of blood slides, malaria treatment provided by mobile clinics&#13;
and at health facilities, and hospitalization and mortality figures from health facilities. Program impact&#13;
will be monitoring through the trends in slide results as verified by baseline and follow-up prevalence&#13;
surveys (Annex 1 1).&#13;
STD/AIDS Component (US$8.2 million; 43% of base costs)&#13;
2.15       Background. Following the first diagnosis of an AIDS case in Sri Lanka in 1986 (para.&#13;
1.12; Annex 4), GOSL moved promptly on a number of fronts to deal with the threat of an HIV/AIDS&#13;
epidemic. It was recognized early on that AIDS prevention and control was a behavioral as much as a&#13;
medical concem and would require a national focus. Consequently, a multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary&#13;
National AIDS Committee reporting to the National Health Council, chaired by the Prime Minister,&#13;
was established and now meets quarterly. With support from WHO and other donors, a first Medium&#13;
Term Plan for HlV/AIDS control and prevention was adopted in 1991 and a second developed in&#13;
1994. Primary responsibility for HIV/AIDS control has been assigned to the STD Control Program of&#13;
the Ministry of Health, which has been redesignated the National STD/AIDS Control Program&#13;
(NSACP). To date, with donor support NSACP staffing, management and capacities have been&#13;
strengthened and the security of the blood supply has been enhanced. Additionally, donors have&#13;
channeled substantial support for educational and counseling activities to NGOs, which have succeeded&#13;
in greatly increasing knowledge about HIV/AIDs in the general population, although corresponding&#13;
understanding of other STDs is still low. A national secretariat for NGOs has been established in the&#13;
Ministry of Social Services. However, much remains to be done, particularly in terms of the diagnosis&#13;
and treatment of other STDs, which is especially important because persons with STD infections are at&#13;
higher risk of HIV infection than any other group.&#13;
2.16       Objectives. Although there is uncertainty about the current level of both HIV prevalence&#13;
and STD incidence in Sri Lanka, it is generally agreed that at present HIV prevalence is relatively low&#13;
and that epidemic spread has not yet begun. Given that avoidance of HIV infection is at present the&#13;
only way to prevent AIDS, the NSACP has recognized the urgency of taking cost-effective measures&#13;
while the prevalence of HIV is still low, to prevent the epidemic spread of HIV infection. The&#13;
objective of the program, therefore, isto -ensure that Sri Lanka remains a low HIV prevalence country.&#13;
2.17       Strategies. To achieve this objective five key strategies have been adopted. The spread&#13;
of HIV is being addressed through: (i) improvement of the capacity of the public and private health&#13;
sectors to diagnose and treat other STDs; (ii) ensuring the safety of the blood supply; (iii) promotion&#13;
of knowledge about HIV/AIDS and avoidance of high-risk behaviors through targeted educational&#13;
efforts; (iv) increased emphasis on multi-sectoral and inter-ministerial involvement and strengthening&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
of the institutional capacity to deal with HIV/AIDS and other STDs; and (v) monitoring of HIV&#13;
prevalence through annual sentinel surveys as well as other behavioral and epidemiological studies.&#13;
2.18       Content. The project will support aspects of the expanded National STD/AIDS Control&#13;
Program not supported from other external and government sources (para. 2.30). The content of this&#13;
support is summarized below; details of the program are given in Annex 4.&#13;
2.19       Improved capacity of public and private health sectors to diagnose and treat other STDs.&#13;
At present, the National STD/AIDS Control Program functions from three separate buildings in&#13;
Colombo, including clinic and laboratory facilities that are dilapidated and completely inadequate for&#13;
current needs. Support will therefore be provided for construction of a new headquarters for the&#13;
NSACP in Colombo that will: (i) serve as the headquarters for the national program; (ii) serve as a&#13;
training center; and (iii) provide clinical and laboratory services and function as a national referral&#13;
center. The new facility will allow much more satisfactory examination, treatment and counseling of&#13;
both male and female patients and will strengthen laboratory services for diagnosis, surveillance&#13;
systems and testing programs. STD and HIV/AIDS data will be computerized, thus facilitating&#13;
tracking of STD, HIV and AIDS cases reported by other STD clinics and the private sector. Provision&#13;
is made for the supply of equipment, computers, furniture, supplies, and a vehicle. The Govemment&#13;
has provided to the Association confirmation that it has title to the site designated for construction of a&#13;
headquarters facility of the STD/AIDS Control Program in Colombo. and that plans for the facility&#13;
have been approved by an architect acceptable to the Association (para. 5.2(a)). together with&#13;
approved bidding documents for construction of a headquarters facility for the STD/AIDS Control&#13;
(para. 5.3(a)).&#13;
2.20       The capacity of existing STD clinics in the nine provincial hospitals to diagnose and treat&#13;
patients, including laboratory work, will be strengthened through modest inputs including physical&#13;
improvements, provision of equipment, furniture, supplies, training, and a vehicle. In ten base&#13;
hospitals located in appropriate areas, STD clinics will be established. These will be supported&#13;
through upgrading of existing hospital space and provision of equipment, furniture, supplies, and&#13;
training. Improved reporting of STD cases to the NSACP in Colombo from both provincial and base&#13;
hospital STD clinics will be emphasized.&#13;
2.21       The NSACP, in cooperation with the Family Health Bureau (FHB), will undertake an&#13;
extensive in-service training program (Annex 4, Attachment 1). Since even with the expansion and&#13;
improvement of public sector STD facilities, it is expected that a majority of STD patients will&#13;
continue to use the private sector, the training program includes STD/HIV/AIDS orientation for private&#13;
sector physicians, who see most of the STD cases. Also provided is management, technical and&#13;
counseling training for NGO members.&#13;
2.22       Since the target populations of the STD/AIDS and family health programs both include&#13;
women in the reproductive age groups (ages 15-49), coordination between the two programs in order&#13;
to enhance reproductive health care is a goal of the NSACP. All staff of facilities that provide care to&#13;
women will be trained in the NSACP/FHB training program, which will cover female reproductive&#13;
health including increased used of modem contraception, linking of condom distribution for family&#13;
planning and STD prevention purposes as appropriate, infection control at delivery, and early&#13;
identification of congenital STD infection in newborns through symptoms such as eye discharge. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
cooperation with NGOs active in AIDS work, joint FHB and NSACP programs for at-risk groups such&#13;
as out of school youth and youth in tourist resort areas will be organized.&#13;
2.23       Security of the blood supply. Support will be provided to the National Blood&#13;
Transfusion Service for continued improvement of blood screening security. At the present time, there&#13;
is an unknown number of unregulated private blood banks. The Govemment has provided assurances&#13;
to the Association that by December 31. 1997 private blood banks will be required to follow Ministry&#13;
of Health standards for the safetW of the blood supply (para. 5.2(fl).&#13;
2.24       Improved AIDS awareness and increased avoidance of high-risk behaviors. Continued&#13;
efforts to improve levels of AIDS awareness and knowledge and to promote avoidance of high-risk&#13;
behaviors by means of targeted education and communication efforts as well as condom promotion&#13;
and distribution are essential to the effort to prevent the epidemic spread of HIV. AIDS awareness&#13;
also needs to be linked to information about other STDs to the extent possible. NGOs, which will&#13;
continue to take the lead in contacting at-risk population groups, are also active in the establishment of&#13;
counseling programs and caretaking procedures for HIV positive and AIDS individuals. Some 50&#13;
NGOs are currently working in these areas, and others have expressed interest in participating.&#13;
Adequate extemal support for NGO activities is considered to be available (para. 2.30). The project&#13;
will support a mass media program coordinated by the Health Education Bureau that will supplement&#13;
interpersonal communication efforts being undertaken by NGOs. Condom vending machines to be&#13;
placed by NGOs working with high-risk groups to further their efforts to promote behavioral change&#13;
will also be supported.&#13;
2.25       Strengthening of program management capacity. WHO will support additional technical&#13;
staff to improve the capacity of the NSACP to plan and implement the program as well as&#13;
management training for program staff. The project will support computerization of the program's&#13;
record keeping, which should greatly improve the recording of all HIV/AIDS and other STD cases&#13;
reported from both public and private sectors and the analysis of program data.&#13;
2.26       Research. monitoriny and evaluation. Three HIV sentinel surveys have been carried out&#13;
using WHO methodology, which identifies female commercial sex workers and STD patients as high-&#13;
risk groups (Annex 4). The forthcoming 1996 survey will cover additional risk groups including&#13;
armed forces members, prisoners, and injecting drug users. Support will be provided for technical&#13;
assistance to review survey sampling design and procedures and to carry out annual surveys.&#13;
2.27       Additionally, provision is made for other epidemiological and behavioral research as&#13;
needed. STD surveys linked to HIV surveillance will be supported, and parallel behavioral surveys to&#13;
monitor progress in promoting behavioral change will be introduced. The Sri Lanka Medical&#13;
Association will cooperate in following up the STD orientation training provided to private sector&#13;
physicians and developing further approaches to strengthening their contribution to the diagnosis and&#13;
treatment of STDs. The extent of injecting drug use in Sri Lanka and its potential role in the spread&#13;
of HIV is a topic that needs to be explored.&#13;
2.28       Inputs. The project provides support for civil works, equipment, computers, supplies,&#13;
vehicles, in-service training, technical assistance, IEC activities and materials, pharnaceuticals,&#13;
contraceptives, salaries and other incremental operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
2.29       Monitoring. The impact of the STD/AIDS Control Program will be monitored through&#13;
the results of annual HIV and behavioral sentinel surveys, which will indicate whether the goals of&#13;
preventing epidemic spread of HI-V and reducing the occurrence of high-risk behavior are being&#13;
achieved. However, given the difficulty of ascertaining current prevalence/incidence rates of HIV and&#13;
other STDs, process monitoring including improved reporting of STD cases from both government&#13;
facilities and the private sector will be emphasized (Annex 11).&#13;
2.30       External support. A large proportion of the expanded STD/AIDS Control Program has&#13;
been funded by donors (UNDP, NORAD, UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO). In 1995 donor assistance&#13;
provided about 70% of the program's funding; in addition USAID provided substantial funding&#13;
directly to NGOs. However, this level of donor support will not be available in the coming years.&#13;
UNDP plans to continue to support the program to some extent, primarily through NGOs. WHO plans&#13;
to provide some funding, at least through 1997, for office rental, technical assistance and management&#13;
training. UJNAIDS will also provide limited support for 1997. The project will therefore provide&#13;
support for that portion of the program that is funded by neither Govemment nor donors. It is&#13;
anticipated that, at least for the first half of the project, adequate NGO support will be available from&#13;
UNDP and other sources. Funding requirements for NGOs in the latter half of the project will be&#13;
reviewed carefully as part of the mid-term review.&#13;
Nutrition Component (US$2.8 million; 14% of base costs)&#13;
2.31       Background. The potentially harmful effects of low birth weight, malnutrition, and&#13;
micronutrient deficiencies in infants and young children on their health and future productivity are&#13;
well documented. The persistence of high levels of these problems in Sri Lanka (paras. 1.14-15;&#13;
Annex 5), despite very low infant mortality, good control of most communicable diseases, and high&#13;
literacy rates, has received considerable attention from the Government in recent years. Recognizing&#13;
that malnutrition is a multifaceted problem that cuts across sectors and that a number of government as&#13;
well as NGO programs are concerned to improve nutritional status, in 1992 the Government&#13;
established a high-level National Steering Committee for nutrition as well as coordinating committees&#13;
at provincial, district and divisional levels.&#13;
2.32       Lead responsibility for implementation of programs to improve nutritional status has been&#13;
assigned to the Ministry of Health. For more than two decades, MOH has attempted to deal with child&#13;
malnutrition, iron-deficiency anemia and low birth weights through a programn that is in principle a&#13;
growth promotion program incorporating growth monitoring by public health midwives (PHMs), a&#13;
food supplement (thriposha), and nutrition education. In practice, however, the program has become a&#13;
limited growth monitoring effort linked to thriposha distribution. The training of many PHMs in&#13;
growth promotion is deficient, and the inclusion of growth monitoring in crowded MCH clinics, where&#13;
a variety of other activities must also be carried out, has constrained the quality of services and made&#13;
nutrition education activities difficult if not impossible. Community outreach, which is also essential&#13;
to a growth promotion program, is not adequate in many areas. Additionally, there is no evidence&#13;
from any of several studies that the expensive and poorly implemented thriposha program (Annex 5)&#13;
has had any sustained impact on the nutritional status of intended beneficiaries. The Government has&#13;
provided assurances that by June 30. 1998. the Ministry of Health will carry out, under terms of&#13;
reference satisfactory to the Association, an evaluation of the impact of the thriposha supplementary&#13;
feeding program and furnish to the Association the findings and recommendations of the evaluation:&#13;
and (ii) the Ministrv of Health will carry out agreed recommendations of the study (para. 5.2(g)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.33       Community-based nutrition and integrated rural development programs are supported by&#13;
UNICEF, UNDP, a number of bilateral donors, and NGOs such as Sarvodaya. The most extensive of&#13;
these is the nutrition component of the IDA-supported Poverty Alleviation (National Development&#13;
Trust Fund) project (Annex 5).3/ The objective of the NDTF nutrition component is to reduce&#13;
malnutrition among young children and low weight births, with emphasis on reaching the poorest and&#13;
most deprived populations. Initial indications are that the 'In-Depth Approach' of the NDTF nutrition&#13;
component is achieving significant reductions in malnutrition. These results have been achieved&#13;
without any food supplementation. The failure of the thriposha program to achieve results, and the&#13;
demonstrated effectiveness of the alternative approach being utilized in the NDTF nutrition&#13;
component, together suggest that the Family Health Bureau's current approach to malnutrition should&#13;
be reoriented.&#13;
2.34       UNICEF has taken the lead in supporting the iodization of salt in Sri Lanka, primarily&#13;
through the supply of equipment to salt producers and promotion of legislation. Legislation mandating&#13;
iodization of salt became effective from July 1, 1995, but experience elsewhere indicates that a purely&#13;
legal strategy is inadequate to eliminate production and sale of non-iodized salt. The low quality of&#13;
most salt produced in Sri Lanka makes it more difficult to iodize and also makes more likely a&#13;
substantial price differential between iodized and non-iodized salt.&#13;
2.35       Objectives. The objectives of the Ministry of Health's nutrition programs are, by the&#13;
end of the project period, to reduce protein-energy malnutrition among infants and young children&#13;
under five to less than 20%, or roughly half of current levels, and virtually eliminate severe&#13;
malnutrition; reduce the proportion of low-weight births to less than 15%; reduce levels of iron-&#13;
deficiency anemia among pregnant women and children substantially; and essentially eliminate iodine&#13;
deficiency diseases.&#13;
2.36       Strategies. Recognizing that inappropriate breast-feeding, weaning and feeding practices,&#13;
rather than household food shortages, underlie much of infant and young child malnutrition in Sri&#13;
Lanka, the Family Health Bureau will reorient and broaden its growth promotion program to&#13;
emphasize maternal nutrition, anemia prophylaxis, and prevention of growth faltering by infants and&#13;
young children rather than cure (i.e. food supplementation) after faltering has begun. The present&#13;
clinic-based focus will shift to a community-based, interpersonal communication approach, which is&#13;
expected to be more cost-effective in Sri Lanka's circumstances where literacy rates are high and&#13;
weaning foods are relatively available. The growth promotion effort will be supplemented by mass&#13;
media campaigns, which provide an essential complement to interpersonal communication; pilot efforts&#13;
to revitalize the health and nutrition education program in the schools; and broadening of the&#13;
UNICEF-supported salt iodization program.&#13;
2.37       Content. Project support for Ministry of Health nutrition programs is summarized&#13;
below; details are given in Annex 5.&#13;
2.38       Institutional strengthening. The project will support strengthening of the Maternal-Child&#13;
Health (MCH) unit of the Ministry of Health (also called the Family Health Bureau), whose&#13;
3/ The Poverty Alleviation Project (Cr. 2231-CD) became effective in September 1991, and the credit&#13;
is scheduled to close in December 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
responsibilities include nutrition. A post of Director Nutrition will be created and supporting office&#13;
establishment provided. The Government has confirmed that a post of Director Nutrition (Ministrv of&#13;
Health) has been created (para. 5.2(b)); and that by March 31. 1997 a candidate whose gualifications&#13;
and experience are acceptable to the Association will be appointed to the post of Director Nutrition&#13;
(Ministry of Health) (para. 5.2(h).&#13;
2.39       Divisional Health &amp; Nutrition Committees. Divisional Health &amp; Nutrition Committees&#13;
have been nominally organized in all divisions but are reported to be effectively functioning in only&#13;
some. With project support and monitoring, these committees are expected to become fully functional&#13;
and to take an active role in the implementation and coordination of nutrition activities in their&#13;
respective divisions. Participation in the committees will be widened to include more of the field&#13;
officers of various govemrnent departments working in the division as well as representatives of the&#13;
NDTF, other development programs and NGOs active in the division, and the new national&#13;
development (Samurdhi) program.&#13;
2.40       Program/project orientation. Provision is made for program/project orientation in the&#13;
first project year for all FHB and provincial staff concerned with nutrition programs, including senior&#13;
officers of the Health Ministry and provincial Departments of Health and members of the divisional&#13;
Health &amp; Nutrition Committees. The orientation will cover current nutrition problems in Sri Lanka,&#13;
the strategies being adopted to address these problems, especially the reorientation of the growth&#13;
promotion program, and coordination with other govemment departments and nutrition programs.&#13;
2.41       Growth promotion program. Experience indicates that successful and cost-effective&#13;
growth promotion programs emphasize interpersonal communication and community participation. A&#13;
national growth promotion program focusing on infants, young children and pregnant women and&#13;
reoriented along these lines will be implemented through existing infrastructure and staff of the Family&#13;
Health Bureau and the provincial Health Departments. It will aim to reduce growth faltering in infants&#13;
and young children through promotion of behavior change, particularly concerning breast-feeding and&#13;
weaning practices. Low birth weight will be addressed through promotion of better maternal nutrition&#13;
and anemia prophylaxis. However, for some women whose short stature is a reflection of childhood&#13;
and adolescent undernutrition, underweight births are difficult to avoid; this problem can be overcome&#13;
only in the next generation through ensuring that daughters receive the adequate nutrition that their&#13;
mothers were lacking. To achieve reorientation of the growth promotion program, the project will&#13;
support in-service training of all PHMs and supervisors in program strategies, technical nutrition&#13;
knowledge and interpersonal communication skills.&#13;
2.42       To move away from the current over-emphasis on growth monitoring, growth promotion&#13;
will be shifted from crowded MCH clinics to community centers, where growth promotion, nutrition&#13;
counseling, and community nutrition activities will be carried out by local volunteers with the support&#13;
and guidance of PHMs. In those areas where community-based nutrition programs, for example the&#13;
NDTF in-depth nutrition component, are currently being implemented, the focus will be on&#13;
coordination between such efforts and the MOH growth promotion program. Where there is no such&#13;
program, once supervisors and PHMs have completed in-service training they will utilize local health&#13;
committees (or organize such committees if they do not already exist) to establish community nutrition&#13;
centers and recruit local volunteers, preferably village mothers, who will be given training. The&#13;
resources and experience of existing NGOs will be utilized in identifying community volunteers, and&#13;
their cooperation will be solicited in setting up community centers and carrying out community-based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
nutrition activities. The training of health staff and community volunteers will draw on the experience&#13;
and materials of the NDTF in-depth nutrition component and other community-based nutrition&#13;
programs to the extent possible. Similarly, the growth promotion, nutrition counseling and community&#13;
nutrition activities of the community centers will draw on the NDTF experience. In view of questions&#13;
concerning roles and capacities of NGO and other community workers that have been raised by health&#13;
staff, it is necessary to clarify the potential participation of community workers in the growth&#13;
promotion program. The Government has provided assurances to the Association that growth&#13;
monitoring and other growth promotion activities may be carried out by trained community volunteers&#13;
under the general guidance of health workers (para. 5.2(i)).&#13;
2.43       A parallel growth promotion program will be carried out in the estate sector, focusing on&#13;
the creches provided for infant and child care while mothers are working. The creches make nutrition&#13;
education for mothers and on-site nutrition supplementation, when required, considerably more&#13;
practical on the estates than in other areas.&#13;
2.44       The communications strategy for the growth promotion program, which will be&#13;
coordinated by the Health Education Bureau (Ministry of Health) and the provincial health education&#13;
units, will focus on basic pregnancy, breast-feeding, weaning and micronutrient messages. To the&#13;
extent possible it will draw on nutrition communications already developed, particularly by UNICEF&#13;
with the support of the IDA-assisted Health &amp; Family Planning project, and by the nutrition&#13;
component of the IDA-assisted Poverty Alleviation project. Interpersonal communication by PHMs&#13;
and volunteers to convey key messages concerning pregnancy, breast-feeding, weaning and&#13;
micronutrients and associated nutrition counseling will be the core of the growth promotion effort.&#13;
Mass media campaigns will provide an essential complement to interpersonal communication. In Sri&#13;
Lanka, where literacy is almost universal and the reach of the mass media is extensive, mass media&#13;
efforts are a cost-effective way of conveying and reinforcing key messages to the general population&#13;
as well as specific audiences. Health staff will be inforned about the content and media for upcoming&#13;
campaigns, so that they are able to reinforce and validate local interpersonal efforts. Provision is&#13;
made for technical assistance to support the development of the program's communications strategy.&#13;
Coordination to ensure that the various nutrition programs convey consistent messages is the&#13;
responsibility of the national Nutrition Steering Committee, which will convene workshops as needed.&#13;
2.45       Health and nutrition education program in the schools. The Ministry of Health has a&#13;
nutrition education program in the schools, but it is largely inactive. The Divisional Health &amp;&#13;
Nutrition Committees will be asked to adopt one elementary and one secondary school in their&#13;
respective divisions for the development of model school health and nutrition programs, including&#13;
school medical inspection and follow up as well as health, nutrition and environmental education.&#13;
School gardens will be included. The secondary school programs will be directed particularly at&#13;
health and nutrition education needs of adolescent girls. These model programs will provide the basis&#13;
for the expansion of health and nutrition education activities in the schools at a later stage. An&#13;
experimental health and nutrition education scheme in schools in Kurunegala district will be evaluated&#13;
and expanded with project operational research support if warranted (Annex 5).&#13;
2.46       Basic (Pre-Service) Training. Basic training for public health staff is undertaken at the&#13;
National Institute of Health Sciences (NIHS) Kalutara and at nine other Public Health Training Centers&#13;
(PHTCs). The NIHS takes the lead role in the preparation of curricula for basic training of public&#13;
health staff and will be closely associated with the development of curricula for in-service nutrition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
training of health staff. The content developed for in-service training will also be incorporated into&#13;
the basic (pre-service) training curricula for all categories of public health staff. Of the nine PHTCs,&#13;
four have been strengthened by the current Asian Development Bank (ADB) project. The project will&#13;
support IEC and office equipment as well as upgrading of library facilities for the other five.&#13;
2.47        lodization of salt. lodization of salt is widely accepted to be the most cost-effective way&#13;
to prevent iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). To broaden the UNICEF-assisted salt iodization&#13;
program, the project will support technical and financial planning assistance to the salt industry, which&#13;
will permit the industry to produce better quality salt. Such salt is easier to iodize, and its more&#13;
efficient production will make possible reduction of the price differential between iodized and non-&#13;
iodized salt. This supply-side assistance will be complemented by support for social marketing to&#13;
enhance the demand for iodized salt. Provision is also made for baseline and follow-up surveys of&#13;
household use of iodized salt and IDD status, and for training of health staff responsible for&#13;
monitoring compliance with the legislation mandating iodization of salt.&#13;
2.48        Research. Coordination of a program of operational and technical research will be the&#13;
responsibility of the Nutrition Division of the Medical Research Institute. The Nutrition Division has&#13;
adequate staff for this purpose; provision is made for support of office and computer facilities and a&#13;
vehicle. The Nutrition Working Group (para. 2.51) will develop a list of research proposals and&#13;
establish priorities for implementation. Additionally, the Nutrition Division will establish a screening&#13;
and technical review process and will invite proposals from outside the Ministry of Health; these could&#13;
be submitted by individuals, academic or other research organizations, NGOs, etc. A number of&#13;
operational research proposals have already been made (Annex 5).&#13;
2.49        Inputs. The project will support equipment, vehicles, computers, technical assistance, in-&#13;
service training, IEC activities and materials, and incremental operating costs.&#13;
2.50        Monitoring. Growth monitoring results and other growth promotion activities will be&#13;
routinely monitored through a system of monthly reports. The impact of the program will be specially&#13;
monitored through the designation of at least one sentinel division in each province, where baseline&#13;
surveys and special efforts to ensure completeness of growth monitoring and program reporting will&#13;
make it possible to track program progress continuously. Baseline surveys will also be carried out in&#13;
matched divisions for control purposes. Overall program impact will be monitored through project&#13;
support for continuation of the series of national nutrition surveys that extends back for more than 20&#13;
years.&#13;
2.51        Management. A Nutrition Working Group in the Ministry of Health, chaired by the&#13;
Director Nutrition and including representatives from the Health Education Bureau and the Medical&#13;
Research Institute, will be constituted to provide policy and implementation guidance. The Director&#13;
Nutrition will invite the participation of others working in the nutrition field from within government,&#13;
academic institutions and other organization. The Working Group will meet at least once a quarter to&#13;
review the progress of the component. Two long-term national consultants will be supported for the&#13;
duration of the project to assist the development and implementation of the growth promotion&#13;
program.&#13;

NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TRANSITION&#13;
Pilot Non-Communicable Diseases Component (US$0.4 million; 2% of base costs)&#13;
2.52       Background. The health services in Sri Lanka have developed in circumstances in&#13;
which the clear priority has been control of communicable diseases. However, Sri Lanka is now well&#13;
advanced in the epidemiological transition, that is, communicable diseases have been largely controlled&#13;
and the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is increasing as life expectancy rises and the&#13;
population ages. This situation has been well documented by a burden of disease study (Annex 8).&#13;
Although recent Ministry of Health policy documents call for increased attention to NCDs, in practice&#13;
little attention has been given to systematic efforts to address these diseases. Particularly at primary&#13;
care levels, health professionals are inadequately prepared for effective patient care, nor at community&#13;
level is there any provision for preventive and promotive NCD strategies linked to health and nutrition&#13;
education efforts.&#13;
2.53       Over the last 15 years, there has been a very substantial increase in investment in hospital&#13;
facilities (para. 1.31), undoubtedly driven in good measure by the increasing burden imposed by&#13;
NCDs. However, it is clear from international experience that preventive and promotive measures that&#13;
prevent or reduce morbidity, disability and mortality are far more socially desirable as well as cost-&#13;
effective than subsequent hospital-based efforts to treat disease and disability. For example, it is&#13;
known that: appropriate control can prevent or delay the onset of diabetic complications; early&#13;
recognition and appropriate control of hypertension will prevent cardiovascular disease and&#13;
cerebrovascular disease (stroke); regular physical exercise and appropriate nutrition will reduce the&#13;
incidence of cardiovascular disease; and avoidance of smoking will reduce the incidence of&#13;
cardiovascular disease, stroke and several cancers.&#13;
2.54       Objectives/Strategies. To assist Sri Lanka to effectively address increasing NCD&#13;
concerns, the project will support a small pilot NCD component. The objectives of the component&#13;
will be to develop an NCD strategy for Sri Lanka, based on compilation of an NCD data base,&#13;
development of recommendations in NCD-related areas of food and tobacco policy, and, on a pilot&#13;
basis, development of cost-effective programs for the prevention and control of selected NCDs.&#13;
Implementation will draw largely on the existing infrastructure and staff of the Ministry of Health but&#13;
will also utilize resources available in the universities, the NGO sector and the private for-profit sector.&#13;
The knowledge and experience gained from implementation of the pilot component are expected to&#13;
provide the basis for subsequent expansion of cost-effective NCD programs nationally.&#13;
2.55       Content. The component will undertake the following activities on a national basis:&#13;
(a)   assessment of the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease,&#13;
cerebrovascular disease, cancers, and other NCDs as well as obesity, smoking and other&#13;
predisposing conditions and behavior through a National Risk Factor Prevalence survey;&#13;
(b)   assessment of the care and treatment currently provided for NCDs in the public and&#13;
private sectors;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
(c)   development of best practice NCD guidelines for health care professionals and health&#13;
educators reflecting cost-effective approaches. The resulting manuals will be presented to&#13;
health care professionals in the public and private sectors at a series of workshops;&#13;
(d)   development of national communication strategies for NCD prevention including national&#13;
mass media campaigns. Such campaigns will be coordinated by the Health Education&#13;
Bureau of MOH;&#13;
(e)  establishment of an NCD data registry in cooperation with the epidemiological unit of&#13;
MOH; and&#13;
(f)   development of recommendations linked to NCDs in the areas of food and tobacco&#13;
policy. Expertise available with the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA), the&#13;
universities and the NGO community will be utilized in this regard.&#13;
2.56       The project will also support a pilot program to address prevention and control of&#13;
diabetes, which, on the basis of existing experience, has been recommended by the SLMA as the first&#13;
priority for a pilot program. The Government has provided assurances that by June 30. 1997 an&#13;
operational plan for a pilot diabetes program acceptable to the Association will be prepared and&#13;
furnished to the Association for its concurrence, and that the plan will be carried out taking into&#13;
account the Association's comments (para. 5.2(i)). The pilot program will include:&#13;
(a)   establishment of a core team including a physician, nurse-educator and dietician at a&#13;
selected medical facility to develop and test approaches to diabetes prevention, treatment&#13;
and control, including communications and outreach aspects;&#13;
(b)   establishment of a network of specialists in a variety of fields (e.g. endocrinology,&#13;
ophthalmology, neurology, nephrology, etc.) to provide specialized advice and support to&#13;
the core diabetes team as needed;&#13;
(c)   development of an outreach program through the primary health care system to train&#13;

and other NCDs, including the development of educational materials;&#13;
(d)   organization of a workshop in the latter half of the project to present the experience and&#13;
recommendations of the pilot diabetes program.&#13;
2.57       If the experience of the pilot diabetes program is good, a second NCD program may be&#13;
implemented in the second half of the project.&#13;
2.58       Provision is made for support of operational research on prevention and control of NCDs,&#13;
as assessed by the Standing Committee on NCDs of the SLMA. NGOs, academic centers, etc. will be&#13;
encouraged to submit proposals for support.&#13;
2.59       Inputs. The project will support equipment, computers, vehicles, training, technical&#13;
assistance, IEC activities and materials, and incremental operating costs.&#13;

2.60       Evaluation. Evaluation of the impact, cost benefit, cost effectiveness, and replicability&#13;
of all interventions supported by the component will be carried out in cooperation with the&#13;
Management Development &amp; Planning Unit (MDPU) of the Ministry of Health, drawing on assistance&#13;
available to the MDPU from the Health Economics Study Program (HIESP) of the Department of&#13;
Economics, University of Colombo (para. 2.69).&#13;
2.61       Management. The component will be managed by the Research and Training Unit,&#13;
under the Deputy Director General, Research and Training, of the Ministry of Health. The DDG will&#13;
seek the assistance of the Standing Committee on Non-Communicable Diseases of the Sri Lanka&#13;
Medical Association and the NCD interest group at the University of Colombo Medical School which&#13;
already has experience in the prevention and management of NCDs. A long-term national consultant&#13;
will be contracted to manage implementation of the component.&#13;
PROGRAM SUPPORT&#13;
Health Policy Development Component (US$1.3 million; 6% of base costs)&#13;
2.62       Background. The earlier IDA-assisted Health &amp; Family Planning project (para. 1.37)&#13;
financed a Health Strategy and Financing Study (HSFS) to identify health sector issues and provide&#13;
guidance on policy development and planning in the sector. The study documented the expanding role&#13;
of the private sector in the provision of health care and identified as issues, among others, the need to&#13;
improve the quality and efficiency of services through strengthening the referral system, determining&#13;
altemative uses for types of facilities known to be ineffective, and addressing inefficiencies in the&#13;
pharmaceutical sector, and the need to provide additional resources through expansion of cost recovery&#13;
in the tertiary hospital sector.&#13;
2.63       The Prospective Plan for Health Development (1995-2004) recently published by the&#13;
Ministry of Health is comprehensive in scope and constructively addresses, among others, most of the&#13;
issues identified by the HSFS. The Plan recognizes that while Sri Lanka has made notable public&#13;
health achievements, in view of changing demographic and epidemiological circumstances combined&#13;
with increasingly constrained resources, efforts to deal with efficiency, effectiveness and financing&#13;
issues in the sector are now required. However, the means to move from identification of policy&#13;
requirements to effective planning and implementation need to be strengthened. The Government has&#13;
provided a Letter of Health Development Policy acceptable to the Association. The Letter&#13;
summarized the Government's intentions with reference to future policies. strategies and priorities for&#13;
the overall development of the health sector. including specific steps which the Government intends to&#13;
take in the areas of pharmaceutical policy, improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of the&#13;
health system. and resource generation in tertiarv health facilities (para. 5.1). The Letter is included in&#13;
Annex 6.&#13;
2.64       Objectives. The objectives of the component are to support strengthening and&#13;
institutionalization of Government's currently weak capacity for policy analysis and planning in the&#13;
health sector; and to support further research and analysis of health policy and financing issues linked&#13;
to implementation of associated pilot activities.&#13;
2.65       Strategies. To accomplish these objectives, the project will support (i) an agreed&#13;
program of policy-related studies and pilot activities; (ii) a process of health planning and capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
development; and (iii) strengthening of analytic and planning capacity in the Ministry of Health and&#13;
the Ministry of Finance &amp; Planning.&#13;
2.66       Content. The development of an agreed program of policy-related studies (Annex 6)&#13;
was begun as a part of project preparation. Five major areas for policy-related studies were agreed:&#13;
(i) improved quality and efficiency of the health services; (ii) generation of additional resources for&#13;
tertiary care; (iii) appropriate public-private mix in the health sector; (iv) addressing NCD morbidity&#13;
and disability; and (v) other significant health policy areas, including mental health, violence against&#13;
women, and environmental health. Prior to the end of each project year, IDA and the Ministry of&#13;
Health will review the status of the studies program and jointly agree on the program for the&#13;
subsequent year. The Government has provided assurances to the Association that under terms of&#13;
reference and in accordance with a time schedule agreed with the Association, a program of policv-&#13;
related studies will be carried out: that the results and findings of the studies will be reviewed annually&#13;
with the Association: and that the recommendations will be timely implemented. taking into account&#13;
the Association's comments (para 5.2(k)).&#13;
2.67       To strengthen understanding of the significance of health economics and financing issues&#13;
and their role in health planning, the project will support a process of health planning and capacitv&#13;
development conceming various health economics and financing issues and options. The process will&#13;
comprise one-day orientation seminars for senior managers; one-week workshops for managers at&#13;
provincial, divisional and medical institution levels; and orientation meetings for consultants, matrons&#13;
and nursing sisters at major hospitals. The program will be managed by the Director Training.&#13;
2.68       To strengthen the development of analytic and planning capacity for the health sector&#13;
within the Govemment, the project will support (i) three masters level fellowships in the Planning unit&#13;
of the Ministry of Health; and (ii) one masters level and one short-term fellowship in the Ministry of&#13;
Finance &amp; Planning.&#13;
2.69       To provide access to additional analytical and planning resources to the Ministry of&#13;
Health, the project will support a link program between the Ministry and the Health Economics Study&#13;
Program (HESP) of the Center for Economic Research and Analysis at the University of Colombo.&#13;
The link program will include development of policy and analysis capacity at HESP, close&#13;
involvement of HESP in agreed programs of research and training for the Ministry of Health, and&#13;
direct advisory support to the Ministry in health economics, financing and evaluation of programs.&#13;
The link program will be established through a contract between the Ministry of Health and HESP&#13;
(Annex 6), which will include provision for computers and other equipment and supplies as well as&#13;
one masters level and one short-term fellowship to strengthen the capacity of the HESP. Additionally,&#13;
support will be provided to the Department of Census and Statistics to include a health costs module&#13;
in one or more of the periodic national surveys undertaken by the Department.&#13;
2.70       The Ministry of Health recognizes that there is a need to strengthen planning capacity at&#13;
the provincial level, particularly in the areas of cost-effective health interventions based on&#13;
epidemiological and burden of disease analysis, as well as quality and efficiency improvement. The&#13;
project will therefore support development of such planning capacity in selected provinces through: (i)&#13;
training of provincial health staff with planning responsibilities and staff of the district health teams;&#13;
(ii) development of planning methodologies appropriate for provincial-level planning; and (iii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
assistance for two cycles of annual planning including provision of computers, software and training&#13;
required for the purpose.&#13;
2.71       Inputs. The project will support equipment, computers, technical assistance, in-service&#13;
training, and incremental operating costs.&#13;
2.72       Management. The component will be managed by the Deputy Director General&#13;
Planning.&#13;
Management Information Systems (MIS) Component (US$1.6 million; 8% of base costs)&#13;
2.73       Background. More accurate information on health status and services, as well as&#13;
improved availability of information, are both essential to increased effectiveness of the health services&#13;
provided by MOH. Data collection and reporting systems are basically in place in the Ministry, but&#13;
compliance with reporting requirements and availability of data in useful and usable forms both need&#13;
to be improved.&#13;
2.74       Objectives. The objective of the component is to support increased capacity of the&#13;
Management Planning and Development Unit (MDPU) of MOH to organize and utilize information for&#13;
management and planning purposes.&#13;
2.75       Strategies. The project will support the development of a management information unit&#13;
under the Director Planning &amp; Management Information (PMI) as a part of the MDPU. This unit will&#13;
be the integrating unit for management information in the Ministry and will review and coordinate all&#13;
information-related activities. Through training and information technology inputs, some support to&#13;
provincial and district levels will also be provided.&#13;
2.76       Content. The PMI unit will be responsible for:&#13;
(a)   coordination of all information technology within the Ministry of Health;&#13;
(b)   development of plans for improvement of the use of information in the Ministry;&#13;
(c)  support for the development of inter-office connections within the Ministry (LANs) as&#13;
well as e-mail connections to allow interministry communications and to provide a&#13;
gateway to internet communications in support of MOH activities;&#13;
(d)  support for the development of existing information systems such as that used by the&#13;
Family Health Bureau for collection of information from the provinces and review of all&#13;
plans for MIS systems at provincial, district and DDHS levels; and&#13;
(e)   development of training courses in the use of information for management purposes.&#13;
The necessary software and related requirements will by developed through local consultancy in the&#13;
first two years of the project (Annex 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
2.77       The current ADB-assisted project includes support for pilot development of information&#13;
management at divisional and district levels which is complementary to the MIS development&#13;
supported by the project. The project will also provide support to the Human Resources Information&#13;
System (HRIS) developed with support from the IDA-assisted Health &amp; Family Planning project.&#13;
2.78       Inputs. The project will support equipment, computers, technical assistance, in-service&#13;
training, salaries and incremental operating costs.&#13;
2.79       Management. The component will be managed by the Director Planning &amp;&#13;
Management Information.&#13;
Health Education Bureau Component (US$2.5 million; 12% of base costs)&#13;
2.80       Background. For more than half of the goals of national health policy as identified in&#13;
recent MOH policy documents, the primary determinant of improvement is individual and/or&#13;
household health behavior, underlining the key role played by health education in achieving health&#13;
objectives. Promoting behavior change through health education plays a major role in all programs&#13;
supported by the project.&#13;
2.81       The effectiveness of communication efforts that have been undertaken in Sri Lanka, both&#13;
interpersonal and through the mass media, is reflected by, for example, the successful promotion of&#13;
contraception, resulting in the virtual achievement of replacement fertility, and the very high&#13;
proportion of births in health facilities; recently, a mass media campaign concerning leprosy was&#13;
considered to have reached a wide audience and effectively communicated the intended messages. It&#13;
is generally agreed that both the high level of literacy in Sri Lanka as well as the capacity of the&#13;
Health Education Bureau have contributed to the significant impact of health education efforts.&#13;
2.82       Objectives. The objectives of the component are to (i) support enhanced quality,&#13;
effectiveness, and coverage of the health education activities of the Health Education Bureau; and (ii)&#13;
improve the ability of HEB to carry out an expanded program of training in interpersonal&#13;
communication. In contrast to the situation in some developing countries, the demonstrated&#13;
competence of HEB makes it realistic to support expansion of its scope and activities.&#13;
2.83       Strategies. HEB will adopt a new approach emphasizing in-service training of primary&#13;
health care staff in interpersonal communication skills. In other countries where similar training&#13;
strategies have been adopted, the results in terms of improved primary health care performance have&#13;
been both evident and cost-effective. To achieve improved quality and coverage of health education&#13;
activities, the Bureau's planning, management and technical capacities, health education (HE) capacity&#13;
at health facilities, and HE staffing at divisional level will all be strengthened.&#13;
2.84       Content. Management and technical skills of HEB headquarters staff will be upgraded&#13;
through national and international training. Planning and management systems will be strengthened&#13;
through the acquisition of computer capacity supported by systems analysis and data entry capability.&#13;
Actual production of materials and development of media campaigns will continue to be largely&#13;
contracted to the private sector, taking advantage of good private sector capacity in the advertising and&#13;
related fields in Sri Lanka.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
2.85       The coverage of HEB activities will be expanded through the provision of HE technology&#13;
to upgrade existing hospital HE units, whose ability to function has been constrained by lack of&#13;
equipment and materials. Feedback from those HE units which were assisted in three districts under&#13;
the IDA-supported Health &amp; Family Planning project indicates that inputs have been put to effective&#13;
use. Additionally, MOH will support the appointment of 50 Health Education Officers a year at&#13;
divisional level over the next five years from its own resources, with the goal of ultimately providing&#13;
a Health Education Officer at each of the 259 divisional headquarters (DDHS). Existing Public Health&#13;
Inspectors (PHIs) and Public Health Nurses (PHNs) are eligible for promotion to these posts; promotee&#13;
training for those selected will be supported by the project.&#13;
2.86       HEB will provide in-service interpersonal communication training to all field staff as a&#13;
part of the training for the nutrition component. Training to be provided under the malaria and&#13;
STD/AIDS components will provide additional opportunities for review of communication skills as&#13;
well. To enhance the capacity of HEB to provide training at headquarters, including training of&#13;
trainers, the project will support the construction of an HEB hostel in Colombo. The Government has&#13;
confirmed to the Association that it has title to the site designated for a Health Education Bureau&#13;
hostel in Colombo. and that the plans for the building have been approved by an architect acceptable&#13;
to the Association (para 5.2(d)). It has provided to the Association approved bidding documents for&#13;
construction of a Health Education Bureau hostel in Colombo (para. 5.3 (b)).&#13;
2.87       Inputs. A long-term consultant will be contracted to assist HEB with the management&#13;
and implementation of the greatly increased training and activities load that the project will entail. To&#13;
strengthen HEB, the project will support civil works, furniture, equipment, computers, vehicles,&#13;
technical assistance, in-service training, incremental staff, and incremental operating costs. The health&#13;
education activities and materials in support of individual programs are included as part of those&#13;
programs.&#13;
C. Environmental Considerations&#13;
2.88       The proposed project was determined to be in screening Category C, which includes&#13;
projects that are expected to have no significant negative environmental impact. No environmental&#13;
analysis has been prepared for this project. A positive environmental impact is expected from the&#13;
revised malaria control strategy that the project will support, since the amount of insecticide used&#13;
annually for spraying has been reduced by 65%.&#13;

3.3.            Sustainability. Successive governments in Sri Lanka have been fully and firmly&#13;
committed to support public health services. Continued priority support for the programs that&#13;
address major public health problems--malnutrition, malaria control, STD/AIDS--can be&#13;
expected. The recurrent cost implications of the project are modest, reaching about 1.8 % by the&#13;
final project year (Annex 9). Of the incremental recurrent costs, the project will finance only&#13;
drugs, medical supplies and laboratory supplies. For the malaria and nutrition components, with&#13;
the completion of project-assisted intensive phases of these programs it is anticipated that after&#13;
completion of the project the resources required to sustain progress will be significantly lower&#13;
than the level of project inputs. STD/AIDS requirements, however, are likely to continue to&#13;
increase for the foreseeable future. Altogether, it is estimated that in the first post-project year,&#13;
project-related recurrent costs would decline to about 1.6% of the projected recurrent budget for&#13;
Health (Annex 9), a necessary and sustainable public health outlay.&#13;

B. Financing Plan&#13;
3.4.           The proposed IDA credit of US$18.76 million equivalent will finance about 83%&#13;
of total project costs, comprising 100% of total foreign exchange costs and about 85% of total&#13;
local costs. Government is expected to finance about US$3.84 million equivalent of total project&#13;
costs, including US$2.02 million of taxes and duties. Table 3.3 shows the financing plan.&#13;

3.5.           Retroactive Financing. Provision for retroactive financing estimated at&#13;
US$500,000 has been included. These funds will be used for support of the Project Management&#13;
Unit office, baseline surveys in the Malaria and Nutrition components of the project, support for&#13;
district (regional) malaria control offices and other activities that will facilitate start-up prior to&#13;
project effectiveness.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
3.6.           The procurement of all items funded from the IDA credit will be governed by&#13;
the World Bank Guidelines of January 1995 (revised January and August 1996). For&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), IDA's standard bidding documents will be used. For&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) bidding documents acceptable to IDA will be used.&#13;
Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.4, and details of the procurement plan are&#13;
given in Annex 11. The General Procurement Notice has been issued.&#13;
3.7.           All procurement will be carried out by the Project Management Unit in the&#13;
Ministry of Health (para. 3.19), except for procurement of condoms, condom vending machines&#13;
and contraceptives, which is expected to be carried out by UNFPA. Procurement information&#13;
will be collected and recorded as follows: (a) prompt report to IDA of contract award&#13;
information by the Borrower; and (b) comprehensive semi-annual reports to IDA by the&#13;
Borrower indicating: (i) revised cost estimates for individual contracts; (ii) revised timing of&#13;
procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for&#13;
individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specific methods of&#13;
procurement.&#13;

3.8.         The civil works included under the project (estimated cost of US$2.6 million)&#13;
comprise: (i) construction of an STD/AIDS complex; (ii) construction of a hostel for the Health&#13;
Education Bureau; (iii) construction of five incinerators at urban health care centers in Colombo;&#13;
and (iv) minor refurbishment and upgrading of provincial and base hospital STD clinics. These&#13;
construction activities will be undertaken during the first, second and third project years. The&#13;
civil works contract for the STD/AIDS complex (estimated cost of US$0.86 million) will be&#13;
procured through ICB. All other civil works contracts will be for less than US$400,000 and will&#13;
be contracted using NCB procedures. With the exception of the HEB hostel (estimated cost of&#13;
US$300,000), the other contracts are expected to be for less than US$60,000 each, in scattered&#13;
locations. Because of the low value of these contracts and/or the remote location of the&#13;
construction sites, it is not expected that they will attract international bidders.&#13;
3.9.         The gooda to be financed from the IDA credit include office and laboratory&#13;
equipment, furniture, consumables, computer hardware and software, medical supplies, drugs&#13;
and contraceptives. To the extent possible, these items will be grouped into several procurement&#13;
packages. For two packages of computer hardware and software of US$0.32 million and above,&#13;
procurement will be through International Competitive Bidding (ICB). One package of&#13;
specialized laboratory equipment, furniture and consumables totaling US$0.45 million will be&#13;
procured through ICB. Drugs and medical supplies with a value of US$4.0 million will be&#13;
grouped into suitable procurement packages and procured through ICB. Condoms, condom&#13;
vending machines and contraceptives totaling about US$0.36 million will be procured through&#13;
UJNFPA. Miscellaneous equipment and supplies with a total value of US$0.92 million will be&#13;
grouped into two packages and procured through ICB. About US$0.30 million of miscellaneous&#13;
equipment and supplies will be grouped into suitable contracts and procured through NCB. The&#13;
balance covering furniture, miscellaneous small office equipment, small computer hardware&#13;
items and office items, and small amounts of medical supplies, not to exceed a total value of&#13;
US$0.58 million, will be procured through National Shopping (NS). Spare parts and small&#13;
maintenance equipment items for vehicles, medical lab equipment, and computer hardware&#13;
totaling US$1.35 million will be procured through NS.&#13;
3.10.        All vehicles totaling about US$2.55 million will be procured through ICB and&#13;
will be grouped into suitable procurement packages. Procurement of ambulances for transport of&#13;
falciparum malaria cases and other medical emergencies would be conditional on a review of&#13;
transport aspects of the health system that would indicate the justification in cost-effectiveness&#13;
terms for the type and number of vehicles needed and address sustainability issues.&#13;
3.11.        All consultants for technical assistance (TA) will be selected in accordance with&#13;
the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank&#13;
as Executing Agency" (August 1981). Contracts for architectural design and supervision for the&#13;
STD/AIDS complex and the Health Education Bureau hostel, which will require an estimated 12&#13;
person-months, and the TA for the design and implementation of management information&#13;
systems, which will require an estimated 156 person-months, are expected to be awarded to&#13;
firms. Additionally, a contract with the Health Economics Study Program, Department of&#13;
Economics, University of Colombo, for support to the Ministry of Health in the areas of health&#13;
economics and financing is expected to provide for approximately 30 person-months over five&#13;
years. Technical support to be provided by individuals to the STD/AIDS, Nutrition, NCD, HEB&#13;
and project management components for the duration of the project is expected to result in&#13;
approximately 700 person-months of individual TA. International training in the form of&#13;
international fellowships and training courses, which will total an estimated 100 person-months,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
will be provided by academic institutions or training institutes. These will be contracted on the&#13;
basis of Direct Contracting. Production of health education materials will be procured by NCB or&#13;
NS, depending on the value of the package. In-service training of Ministry of Health staff,&#13;
including development and production of course materials and travel and subsistence costs for&#13;
trainers and trainees, will be carried out departmentally by the Ministry of Health. Surveys and&#13;
studies will be carried out departmentally by the Ministry of Health with some technical&#13;
assistance from other government departments.&#13;
3.12.        All bidding packages procured through ICB and other packages for civil works&#13;
and goods estimated to cost US$200,000 or more will be subject to prior IDA review. In&#13;
addition, there will be a prior IDA review process for the first package of each procurement&#13;
category (civil works, goods, etc.) procured through NCB. International fellowships and study&#13;
tours will be reviewed by IDA to ensure that they are in accordance with Association guidelines.&#13;
Terms of reference (TOR) for consultant contracts will be subject to prior review by IDA,&#13;
regardless of value. In addition IDA will review short lists, letters of invitation, and consultant&#13;
contracts higher than US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. The Government has&#13;
provided to the Association confirmation that acceptable sample procurement documents for&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) are available&#13;
(para. 5.2(e)).&#13;
D. Disbursement&#13;
3.13.        Preparation of disbursement applications will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Ministry of Health. The Project Management Unit (para. 3.19) will be responsible for preparing&#13;
and maintaining all documentation.&#13;
3.14.        The Project is expected to be completed in five years, by December 31, 2001,&#13;
and the Credit is scheduled to close on June 30, 2002. Expected disbursement from the IDA&#13;
credit over a five-year period and disbursement against specific categories are given in Annex&#13;
12. Care has been taken to plan procurement of virtually all civil works, vehicles, and&#13;
equipment in the first half of the project.&#13;
3.15.        Disbursements will finance: (i) 85% of the costs for civil works; (ii) for goods&#13;
100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures ex-factory cost and 85% of local&#13;
expenditures for other items procured locally; (iii) 100% of the cost for foreign and local&#13;
consultancies and training; (iv) 100% of the health and nutrition and research, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation activities; and (v) 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures ex-&#13;
factory cost and 85% of local expenditures for other items procured locally for health and&#13;
nutrition education materials.&#13;
3.16.        To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower will establish a Special&#13;
Account on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA to cover IDA's share of expenditures. The&#13;
Authorized Allocation will be US$500,000, representing about four months of average&#13;
expenditures made through the Special Account. During the early stages of the project, the&#13;
initial allocation to the Special Account will be limited to US$250,000. However, when&#13;
aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached the level of SDR3,500,000 equivalent,&#13;
the initial allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of US$500,000 by&#13;
submission of the relevant withdrawal applications. Applications for replenishment of the&#13;
Special Account will be submitted monthly but not less than quarterly or when one third of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs sooner. Documentation requirements for&#13;
replenishment will follow standard IDA procedures as described in the Disbursement Handbook,&#13;
Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the&#13;
Borrower should accompany all replenishment requests.&#13;
3.17.        Disbursement for civil works contracts valued at more than US$200,000 and&#13;
goods at more than US$200,000 will be made against full documentation. Similarly,&#13;
disbursement for contracts to consultancy firms valued at more than US$100,000 and for&#13;
individual consultants valued at more than US$50,000 will also be made against full&#13;
documentation. Disbursement for contracts for civil works, goods and consultancy services&#13;
valued below these thresholds may be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOE).&#13;
Supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained by the implementing agency for at least two&#13;
years after disbursement. Direct payment applications will be accepted for minimum amounts of&#13;
US$50,000 when the initial deposit is US$250,000 and US$100,000 when the initial deposit is&#13;
increased to US$500,000.&#13;
E. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.18.        Procedures for accounts and audits will follow the Bank's "Guidelines for&#13;
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank." The Project&#13;
Management Unit will maintain a consolidated account of all expenditures under the project.&#13;
The Borrower will provide to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year an audit&#13;
report. The project accounts will be audited annually by auditors satisfactory to IDA in&#13;
accordance with appropriate auditing principles, with terms of reference approved by IDA. The&#13;
audit reports should include a separate opinion on the adequacy of SOEs and on the Special&#13;
Account. Govemment has provided assurances that: (i) independent auditors acceptable to IDA&#13;
will be appointed in a timely manner to undertake annual audits and to prepare audit reports of&#13;
the Pro_ject Accounts. Special Accounts and SOE : and (ii) certified copies of the audited project&#13;
accounts and the Special Account statements. together with the auditor's report and opinion&#13;
thereon. and a copy of the auditor's report and opinion on SOEs will be provided to IDA within&#13;
six months of the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
3.19         Overall guidance for the project will be provided by a Project Steering&#13;
Committee. The Steering Committee will be chaired by the Secretary Health, with the project&#13;
coordinator as secretary. Members will include project component managers and&#13;
representatives of the Economic Resources Department, the National Planning Department and&#13;
the Department of Budget.&#13;
F. Project Management and Implementation&#13;
3.20.        Overall project management and coordination will be the responsibility of a&#13;
Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU will be headed by a full-time project coordinator,&#13;
who will report to the Secretary of the Ministry of Health. The Project Coordinator will be&#13;
assisted by a computer analyst, a project accountant and office staff. The PMU will be&#13;

by the unit of the Ministry of Health concerned, as indicated in the table below. The organization&#13;
chart of the Ministry, which shows these units, is at Chart 1. The ability of these units to&#13;
successfully implement the project components for which they will be responsible is indicated&#13;
generally by the excellent achievements of the health services in Sri Lanka and specifically by&#13;
the effectiveness to date of the AMC, NSACP, and Family Health programs. The MDPU was&#13;
created with assistance from the IDA-supported Health &amp; Family Planning project and is now&#13;
functioning along the lines envisioned in the project. The Health Policy and Management&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. BENEFITS, ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
4.1        The expected benefits of project assistance as well as the negative consequences of non-&#13;
availability of support are as follows.&#13;
(a)   Lack of support for the revised malaria control strategy would mean curtailment of the&#13;
mobile clinic and impregnated bed net strategies that have proved effective.&#13;
Additionally, project resources would make possible improvements in surveillance, early&#13;
warning and management aspects of the program, all of which are expected to make&#13;
significant contributions to sustaining and accelerating current declines in prevalence.&#13;
Without continued support for the revised strategy, malaria prevalence could again be&#13;
expected to rise.&#13;
(b)   The importance of taking measures to control transmission of HIV before epidemic&#13;
spread begins is evident. Support is required for key strategies to improve diagnosis and&#13;
treatment of STDs and to reduce high-risk behaviors through education/ communication&#13;
efforts. Implementation of these measures would mean reasonable prospects for&#13;
prevention of an AIDS epidemic in Sri Lanka in a cost-effective manner; without these&#13;
measures, the chances that epidemic spread could be avoided are poor.&#13;
(c)   Without reorientation of the Ministry of Health's ineffective growth promotion program,&#13;
there are no prospects for significant national reduction of malnutrition levels in the&#13;
shorter tern. The nutrition component of the project would provide the framework and&#13;
the resources necessary to accomplish the needed reorientation and improve nutritional&#13;
status through program interventions.&#13;
(d) It is clear that the disease pattern in Sri Lanka has shifted from childhood communicable&#13;
diseases to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) of adults and that the resulting burden&#13;
on the health system is distorting resource allocation. The pilot NCD component would&#13;
assist the Ministry to systematically define the issues, identify policy measures, and&#13;
develop cost-effective prevention and treatment programs, steps which the Ministry&#13;
would be unlikely to undertake without project initiative and resources.&#13;
(e)   The project support components would enhance the ability of the Ministry of Health to&#13;
plan, manage and implement its programs, thus benefiting the entire public health system.&#13;
The health policy component would support development of policy measures that would&#13;
enable the health system to maintain and improve its good performance under changing&#13;
circumstances. The management information systems component would strengthen the&#13;
capacity of the Ministry to analyze and utilize data for planning and monitoring purposes.&#13;
Through strengthening of the Health Education Bureau, the effectiveness of&#13;
education/communication aspects of all health programs would be improved.&#13;
4.2        For the strengthened malaria and nutrition programs, it is possible to estimate improved&#13;
program impact by the end of the project period. The annual incidence of malaria cases in the six&#13;
high-prevalence districts is expected to fall from more than 40 detected cases per thousand population&#13;
in 1994 to less than 10 per thousand by 2001; this would mean 125,000 fewer detected cases in 2001&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
as compared to 1994. As a result of the reorientation of the growth promotion program, the&#13;
percentage of underweight infants and young children below age five (i.e. below two standard&#13;
deviations of the weight-for-age standard), which was about one third, or more than 500,000 infants&#13;
and children, in 1993, is expected to be reduced to less than 20% by 2001. The percentage of low-&#13;
weight births, which was about 20%, or roughly 80,000 newborns, in 1993, is expected to be reduced&#13;
to less than 15% by 2001. Iodine deficiency is expected to be virtually eliminated and iron-deficiency&#13;
anemia significantly reduced by 2001. The goal of the STD/AIDS program is to reduce the incidence&#13;
of STDs other than AIDS and to ensure than Sri Lanka remains a low HIV-prevalence country.&#13;
B. Economic Justification&#13;
Justification for Public Sector Involvement&#13;
4.3        There is a clear economic justification for public sector involvement in all of the&#13;
programmatic areas supported by the project. For the malaria program, there are positive externalities&#13;
from the early detection and prompt treatment of malaria cases, which reduces transmission.&#13;
Moreover, in the terminology of welfare economics, malaria vector control is in the nature of a public&#13;
good. Interventions to prevent and treat STDs also have positive externalities, as is the case with&#13;
measures to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. The nutrition component addresses imperfect&#13;
information on the part of households which leads to inadequate maternal nutrition and inappropriate&#13;
breast-feeding, weaning and feeding of young children. Such information deficiencies cannot be&#13;
addressed through market mechanisms, since there is no effective demand for this type of information&#13;
services. Similarly, the health education component would strengthen the public sector's ability to&#13;
convey important health-related information to households on a wide variety of topics. And health&#13;
policy development is of course an important public sector function.&#13;
4.4        The case of the NCD component is more complex. To the extent that prevention is an&#13;
important, cost-effective means of reducing the prevalence of some of these diseases (e.g., those which&#13;
are tobacco-related), there would be a clear rationale for public sector intervention in the form of&#13;
health education, and related policy measures, such as taxation, may also be in order. Since the public&#13;
health services presently provide care and treatment for NCDs, and in the short term will continue to&#13;
do so, there is also justification for support for cost-effective improvements in such services. The&#13;
NCD component in the proposed project would focus on the development and dissemination of best&#13;
practice guidelines for the treatment of NCDs, which would address an important information gap for&#13;
both public and, increasingly, private health care providers. The proper role of the public sector&#13;
conceming the treatment of NCDs in the longer term is a complex issue which would need to be&#13;
examined as part of the ongoing policy dialogue.&#13;
Cost-Effectiveness Aspects 1/&#13;
4.5        Malaria. The revised WHO malaria control strategy introduced in 1993, which the&#13;
project would support, was adopted to improve the cost-effectiveness of malaria control in Sri Lanka&#13;
following resurgences in 1987 and again in 1991. The revised strategy emphasizes selective residual&#13;
spraying using several insecticides in rotation as opposed to the old strategy of blanket spraying with&#13;
one insecticide, malathion. It also uses mobile clinics for early detection and treatment in high-&#13;
prevalence districts and promotes the use of insecticide-impregnated beds by households.&#13;
1/ For further details, see Annex 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
4.6        It is likely that the revised strategy is averting a significantly higher number of malaria&#13;
cases per year than the old strategy. The number of cases detected was about 400,000/year in 1991&#13;
and 1992, declined in 1993 to 363,000, still basically under the old strategy, and declined further in&#13;
1994 to 274,000 under the revised strategy; from January through June 1995, only 106,000 cases were&#13;
detected. While other factors such as weather and the natural malaria cycle may have been partly&#13;
responsible for the sharp decline in cases, the switch to the revised strategy is likely to have been the&#13;
major factor. In addition, the new strategy has a lower cost. In the aggregate, total annual program&#13;
costs nationwide declined by about 17% in real terms following the change in strategy. Moreover, the&#13;
new strategy imposes lower costs in terns of environmental degradation, because the amount of&#13;
insecticide required has been reduced by about 65%.&#13;
4.7        STD/AIDS. Calculations of cost-effectiveness of the STD/AIDS control program (e.g.,&#13;
cost per disability-adjusted life year saved) are difficult because current levels of STD and H1V&#13;
incidence and prevalence are not known with any precision; estimates vary widely. The balance of the&#13;
evidence suggests that HIV transmission in Sri Lanka has been fairly limited so far. However,&#13;
complacency must be avoided.&#13;
4.8        The Government's program for prevention of epidemic spread of HI in Sri Lanka was&#13;
developed with technical inputs from WHO and other donors and draws on accumulated international&#13;
experience to identify the most technically appropriate as well as cost-effective strategies. It&#13;
emphasizes: (i) diagnosis and treatment of other STDs, since STD patients are a major HIV risk&#13;
group; (ii) orientation of private sector physicians, who see a large proportion of STD cases; and (iii)&#13;
information, education and communications (IEC) efforts directed at appropriate target groups to&#13;
promote avoidance of high-risk behaviors. IEC activities in the program are carried out by NGOs,&#13;
which is believed to be more cost-effective than implementation by public sector agencies.&#13;
4.9        Nutrition. At present, Government's efforts to reduce malnutrition among pregnant&#13;
women and young children center on the thriposha program, a supplementary feeding program&#13;
(thriposha is the name of a food supplement; for further details, see Annex 5). Expenditure on the&#13;
program is currently about US$4.5 million a year. None of the studies of the program that have been&#13;
carried out indicate that the program has been consistently successful in improving the nutritional&#13;
status of beneficiaries. Possible reasons are that the supplement may be consumed by the entire family&#13;
rather than the target beneficiary; that the mother may reduce the child's regular food when the child&#13;
is given the supplement, resulting in no net increase in nutrient intake; and that mothers fail to obtain&#13;
the supplement with enough regularity to have an impact. Since there is apparently no significant&#13;
impact on the nutritional status of intended beneficiaries, it can be concluded that the thriosha&#13;
program has a very low degree of cost-effectiveness (i.e., a very high cost per case of malnutrition&#13;
averted).&#13;
4.10       The nutrition component of the project would support a shift to a more cost-effective&#13;
strategy to reduce malnutrition among pregnant women and young children. Available data strongly&#13;
suggest that inappropriate breast-feeding, weaning and feeding practices are responsible for much of&#13;
the malnutrition. This, in tum, suggests that the focus of the nutrition program needs to shift from the&#13;
present emphasis on the supply of thriposha to a growth promotion program promoting good&#13;
nutritional practices for pregnant women and young children. Such a program should be particularly&#13;
cost-effective among Sri Lanka's population, where primary education levels are high. This shift&#13;
would be supported by the proposed project. The marginal cost of the growth promotion program&#13;
would be low. No incremental staff would be required. Public health midwives (PHMs) would lead&#13;
the growth promotion efforts in their communities but would rely heavily on NGOs and community&#13;
volunteers to assist in these efforts. Total incremental cost of the growth promotion program over five&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
years, largely for training, IEC materials and activities, and surveys/studies, is estimated to be US$3.5&#13;
million. The subsequent annual incremental costs of the program would be about US$100,000 in 1995&#13;
prices. Based on these cost figures, and the projected increase in the number of cases of malnutrition&#13;
in young children averted (para. 5.2), the cost per case averted under the new strategy in the period&#13;
1996-2000 would be about US$5. (The cost per case averted would be lower if a longer period were&#13;
considered.) This unit cost estimate does not take into account any additional food costs borne by&#13;
households, however.&#13;
4.11       As part of the proposed project, an impact evaluation of the thripos  program would be&#13;
carried out (para. 2.32), and a special effort would be made to monitor the ongoing progress and the&#13;
impact of the reoriented growth promotion program (para. 2.50). It is hoped that positive results of&#13;
the new approach will provide additional evidence to support phasing out of the thriposha program.&#13;
4.12       Non-Communicable Diseases. The NCD component is a pilot component, and only the&#13;
broad principles of its design have been specified so far. Hence, it is not possible to be specific about&#13;
cost-effectiveness aspects, except to save that cost-effectiveness of any prevention, control and/or&#13;
treatment strategies supported would be carefully assessed and would be a key factor in any&#13;
recommendations based on the results of the pilot.&#13;
Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery&#13;
4.13       The fiscal impact of the project would be very small. Incremental recurrent costs arising&#13;
from the project would represent about 2% of the total health recurrent budget by the year 2000. This&#13;
projection assumes that the total health recurrent budget would increase in real terms at the same&#13;
annual rate as projected GDP (about 5%; see Annex 9).&#13;
4.14       There would be no cost recovery associated with interventions supported by the project.&#13;
Most households would not be willing to pay for various types of health/nutrition education services,&#13;
and some of these services are also in the nature of public goods (e.g. use of mass media), which&#13;
would make user fees infeasible in any case. Interventions addressing malaria and STD/AIDS have&#13;
strong positive extemalities, and it is in the public interest to encourage individual households to take&#13;
fill advantage of existing services; the imposition of user fees might contribute to higher prevalence of&#13;
these communicable diseases. However, it may be desirable for the Govemment to impose user fees&#13;
for treatment of NCDs in public facilities This is an important issue for future policy discussions with&#13;
the Govemment.&#13;
Poverty Impact&#13;
4.15       The poverty impact of the interventions supported by the project is difficult to establish&#13;
because of the lack of data relating disease prevalence rates to household income or consumption. For&#13;
malnutrition, there is evidence from household surveys indicating that the proportion of malnourished&#13;
children under 5 years of age declines as per capita household consumption increases. For example, in&#13;
the early 1980s, it was found that the proportion of children who were stunted declined from 49% for&#13;
children in the lowest quintile of the household expenditure distribution to 22% in the highest quintile.&#13;
For wasting, the decline was from 15% to about 9%. Hence, it can be expected that nutrition&#13;
interventions supported by the project would benefit a greater proportion of children in the lowest&#13;
quintile of the household expenditure distribution than in higher quintiles. For malaria and STDs,&#13;
however, the benefits of program interventions are likely to be more uniformly spread out among all&#13;
income classes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
C. Risks&#13;
4.16       The chief risks associated with project implementation concern the following.&#13;
(a)   The unsatisfactory experience of the first half of the IDA-assisted Health &amp; Family&#13;
Planning project raises questions about the implementation capacity of the Ministry of&#13;
Health. In developing the project, care has been taken to avoid the lack of 'ownership'&#13;
and the project management problems (para. 1.39) which led to previous difficulties.&#13;
The Ministry has taken the lead in project development, thus enhancing their sense of&#13;
ownership. Care has been taken to strengthen the Project Management Unit and to&#13;
provide national technical assistance for project-supported programs, in order to ensure&#13;
that adequate support for both project management and program implementation will be&#13;
available. Good performnance in the second half of the Health &amp; Family Planning project&#13;
provides grounds for expecting continued good performance.&#13;
(b)   Provincialization of the health services raises the possibility that previous levels of&#13;
support for services would not be maintained. It is not yet possible to assess this risk,&#13;
because decentralization is an ongoing process and the central Ministry of Health still&#13;
provides most funds. Thus far, the quality of services does not appear to have suffered,&#13;
and some examples of excellent provincial initiatives can be cited. The implications of&#13;
decentralization are being examined as a part of a comparative WHO study (Annex 6),&#13;
and issues that may emerge would be addressed in any future lending.&#13;
(c)   The nutrition and the STD/AIDS components of the project depend to a significant extent&#13;
on the involvement of NGOs. Although the NGO sector in Sri Lanka has substantial&#13;
capacity, the Ministry of Health's record of cooperation with NGOs is not strong. For&#13;
the STD/AIDS program, this issue has been and will continue to be addressed by&#13;
channelling donor assistance to NGOs directly. Additionally, a unified donor community&#13;
has represented strongly to the Ministry that coordination and cooperation between the&#13;
medical and the behavioral aspects of the national AIDS control program is essential to&#13;
its success. For the nutrition program, the focus will be on organizing cooperation&#13;
between the health system and available NGO resources at the divisional and community&#13;
levels to achieve common health and nutrition objectives. Progress in achieving locally&#13;
effectively NGO coordination will be monitored by the project.&#13;
4.17       The project's health policy dialogue must contend generally with complacency&#13;
concerning the need for policy changes in the health sector on the part of some senior managers in the&#13;
Ministry, who cite Sri Lanka's outstanding public health achievements, and specifically with the&#13;
Government's reluctance to consider wide-scale introduction of politically sensitive cost-recovery&#13;
measures. These difficulties will be addressed through a continuing dialogue linked to an agreed&#13;
program of studies and pilot initiatives. The recent publication by the Govemment of a ten-year&#13;
Prospective Plan for Health 1995-2000 that addresses many of IDA's concerns in a positive fashion&#13;
will support the dialogue. However, some of the more controversial policy and financing issues may&#13;
have to be deferred to any future lending.&#13;
4.18       Civil unrest in the northem and eastern regions of the country continue to disrupt&#13;
provision of services in those areas and to pose the threat of other disruptions as well. The&#13;
Government has coped with these difficulties well over more than a decade. Given the Government's&#13;
excellent primary health care achievements, sustained support for the project-supported programs that&#13;
address major public health problems is not considered to be a potential issue.&#13;

HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Organization of the Family Health Program&#13;
1.         The matemal and child health (MCH) program is the major health and nutrition&#13;
intervention strategy of the Ministry of Health. An organized effort to provide MCH services dates&#13;
back to 1906 with the introduction for trained midwifery services in the Municipality of Colombo.&#13;
In 1926 the Department of Health initiated a broad scheme for the provision of Public Health&#13;
Services at Kalutara with the establishment of the first Health Unit. The main activities of the&#13;
health unit included collection of vital statistical data related to the area, delivery of MCH services,&#13;
prevention and control of communicable diseases, environmental sanitation, health education and&#13;
school health activities. By 1950 91 health units had been established and the number was further&#13;
increased to 104 by 1982. In 1989, the country's administration was decentralized with certain&#13;
powers devolved to nine Provincial Councils. Each provincial council has a Provincial Director of&#13;
Health Services assisted by 2 or 3 Deputy Provincial Directors of Health. The latter are supported&#13;
by a technical teams, comprising of a Medical Officer (MCH), Regional Epidemiologist, Regional&#13;
technical teams, comprising of a Medical Officer (MCH), Regional Epidemiologist, Regional SPHN,&#13;
2-3 Health Education Officers, a Survey Statistical Assistant and a Planning Officer.&#13;
2.         After the devolution process and the establishment of a system of Provincial&#13;
administration, the number of health unit areas have increased to 252 and are contiguous with the&#13;
administrative sub-districts or divisions within the province. This massive increase in the number of&#13;
health unit (MOH) areas has created a pressing need for providing additional MOH/DDHS offices,&#13;
in the newly carved out areas. It is from these offices that the management of the entire public&#13;
services are effected. In addition some of the existing offices are in a very unsatisfactory condition&#13;
which hardly bears out the practice of public health or the message of preventive health. Each&#13;
Health Unit is in charge of a Medical Officer of Health, now also referred as a Divisional Director&#13;
of Health Services (DDHS) who is responsible for all promotional and preventive health activities&#13;
within the area, as well as the overall supervision of health institutions, ranging from a district&#13;
hospital, peripheral unit and rural hospital to the central dispensary and maternity home.&#13;
3.         The DDHS/MOH is supported by a team comprising of Public Health Nurses (PHN),&#13;
Public Health Inspectors (PHI), and Public Health Midwives (PHM). The Health Unit Area is sub-&#13;
divided into PHI ranges and still further into PHM areas. Each health unit area has a network of&#13;
medical institutions and health centers which provide institutional and clinic based MCH services.&#13;
The estate sector in also serviced by MCH clinics, conducted on estates either by visiting medical&#13;
officers or by estate health staff. The basic cornerstone of the system rests on the Public Health&#13;
Midwife, who not only provides services at the level of the home, but also links the mother and&#13;
child to the next level of health care, namely that provided at the "health center" (field MCH clinic)&#13;
or at the medical institution. The PHM serves a population ranging from 3,000-5,000, within a&#13;
clearly defined area, which is the smallest working unit within the health system and the first point&#13;
of contact between the health system and the households. Having an intimate knowledge of her&#13;
area and the families she serves, the PHM through a systematic scheme of home-visits provides the&#13;
necessary domiciliary contact and services to mothers and children. This activity is supported by as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
system of record keeping that helps her to plan and monitor her activities, as well as report on her&#13;
performance and the vital events that have occurred in her area, to the MOH/DDHS.&#13;
4.         Mobility has always been a problem for MCH field staff, who have to rely very often&#13;
on public transport which can be very time consuming and unreliable. Strategies to overcome this&#13;
problem will need to be considered if the coverage and quality of the domiciliary services are to be&#13;
improved.&#13;
5.         Trained for a period of 18 months, the midwife spends the first year in a school of&#13;
nursing where she receives an intensive training in midwifery and basic nursing. The next six&#13;
months of her training is spent at the National Institute of Health Science in Kalutara or in selected&#13;
public health training centers, where she applies her knowledge and develops her skills in an actual&#13;
working situation within the community. On successful completion of her training she could be&#13;
appointed either as Public Health Midwife attached to a health unit or as an institutional midwife.&#13;
6.         As a consequence of the greater utilization of institutional facilities for confinement&#13;
(today 98% or more of the deliveries take place in health institutions), the PHM's role in the health&#13;
system gradually changed from a focus on pregnancy and confinement, to a much broader view of&#13;
maternal and child care.&#13;
7.         The present functions of the PHM consists of:&#13;
(a)   Prenatal and natal care which emphasizes early registration of all pregnant mothers in&#13;
her area, regular home visits and prenatal examination with identification of high risk&#13;
mothers and referral where needed; linking mothers to clinics conducted in her area at&#13;
which she also participates; immunization of mothers with tetanus toxoid and ensuring&#13;
that all mothers receive trained assistance at delivery.&#13;
(b)   Postnatal care - regular follow-up visits during the postnatal period for care of the&#13;
mother and the newborn.&#13;
(c)  Infant and young child care - Registration of all infants with a view to ensuring that all&#13;
infants under her care are followed up. Proper advice on infant feeding, weaning and&#13;
child nutrition (including growth monitoring of infants and preschool children).&#13;
Immunization of all infants and preschool children.&#13;
(d)   Family Planning motivation, instruction and provision of contraceptives (condoms and&#13;
oral pills) and facilitating the provision of the other methods of contraception as&#13;
required and assisting at FP clinics in her area.&#13;
(e)   Health education in the other elements of primary health care, particularly the control&#13;
of diarrheal disease with emphasis on oral rehydration therapy (and maintaining&#13;
nutrition during episodes of diarrhoea) and Acute Respiratory Infection.&#13;
8.         The Public Health Nursing Sister (PHNS):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(a)  is responsible to the DDHS/MOH for the management of the MCH/FP (Family Health)&#13;
program and the delivery of the services;&#13;
(b)   provides technical support and performs specific functions as assigned to her at&#13;
MCH/Fp clinics;&#13;
(c)   assists at school health activities;&#13;
(d)   monitors and appraises the performance of PHM's in the Health Unit/DDHS area;&#13;
(e)   conducts family planning clinics in the area;&#13;
(f)   assists the DDHS/MOH in collecting MCH/FP performance data in the area;&#13;
(g) is a source of advice on maternal health, child health and family planning in the&#13;
community.&#13;
9.         The Public Health Inspector:&#13;
(a)  is responsible for the control of communicable diseases, vector control activities, food&#13;
safety, environmental health and sanitation, and the implementation of legislative&#13;
enactments regarding food and sanitation;&#13;
(b)   participates in school health activities and the immunization program;&#13;
(c)   conducts health education programs;&#13;
(d)   provides family planning advice and motivation, particularly to males in the&#13;
community.&#13;
10.        At the National level (Ministry of Health), the Family Health Bureau (FHB) is the&#13;
central organization responsible for planning, coordination, direction, monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
the MCH/FP program within the country. The FHB works in close collaboration with the&#13;
Epidemiology Unit, Health Education Bureau and Population Division of the Ministry of Health and&#13;
also with several UN, International and Non-Governmental organizations. The Family Health&#13;
(MCHIFP) program covers a wide spectrum of services comprising:&#13;
(a) maternal care - Antenatal, Natal and Post Natal;&#13;
(b)  infant and child care - including immunization, growth monitoring, with appropriate&#13;
nutrition interventions, child mental health, control of diarrhoeal diseases and acute&#13;
respiratory inspections;&#13;
(c)   nutrition;&#13;
(d)   school health;&#13;
(e)   family planning.&#13;
11.        Another important category of health worker is the Health Education Officer (HEO),&#13;
attached to the Office of the Deputy Provincial Director of Health Services and to certain Health&#13;
Divisions. These officers assist the public health staff in improving their communication skills and&#13;
organizing the community for carrying out health work. They are also responsible for publicity and&#13;
other IEC activities within the region. The need to equip these HEO's to perform their functional&#13;
effectively will be an important factor in growth promotion and nutrition related actions in the&#13;
community.&#13;
12.        An important aspect of MCH service delivery has been the establishment of health&#13;
centers or "field" MCH clinics, which serve as first level referral centers in the delivery of MCH&#13;
services. These centers/clinics are conducted once a fortnight and provide, antenatal care; screening&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
of infants and preschool children; immunization; family planning; growth monitoring and nutritional&#13;
supplementation (Thriposha) to pregnant and lactating mothers, infants 6-11 months and preschool&#13;
children on a medically selected basis; and general health education activities. On an average one&#13;
center serves two PI-IM areas. The PHM herself personally assists at these centers thereby&#13;
providing a personal link between her people and the health center. The services provided at these&#13;
centers are provided by the DDHSIMOH or other area Medical Officers. The Public Health Nursing&#13;
Sister is responsible for the overall management of the clinic and other relevant clinic activities.&#13;
13.        The health center or field MCH clinics could be held in the smaller medical&#13;
institutions, local government facilities, newly constructed gramodaya health centers (PH-M quarters&#13;
plus clinic) or in private buildings. The location of these centers is usually determined by its&#13;
accessibility to the largest numbers that could be served. Higher levels of care are provided by the&#13;
larger hospitals that provide in-patient care and specialist services.&#13;
14.        These health centers in certain situation are in need of some basic fumiture, service&#13;
items and equipment in order to improve the quality of services. It is at these health centers or field&#13;
MCH clinics that growth monitoring is carried out together with all the other activities that are&#13;
conducted at these centers, including the distribution of Thriposha. It may be for this reason that&#13;
the coverage and quality of growth monitoring has not been what it ought to be, since the other&#13;
activities such as clinical examinations and immunization may take priority. A mother bringing her&#13;
child for growth monitoring could well be discouraged sans the inducement of triposha. As aptly&#13;
described. "A mother brings her child to the clinic, often having walked a long distance, waits for&#13;
the child to be weighed, picks up her packet of Thriposha and goes home as soon as possible.&#13;
There is little time for the PHM or PHNS to speak to the mothers. There is little supervision by the&#13;
MOH/DDHS. Health and nutrition education at the clinic is minimal, if at all." While improving&#13;
the existing physical needs of these clinics there is also a strong justification to look for alternatives&#13;
vis-a-vis growth monitoring activities, such as Village/Community based "Weighing Posts" or&#13;
"Nutrition Centers". This should be feasible if actively pursued, since the growth monitoring cards&#13;
(CHDR) are with the mothers and the duplicate section with the PHM, which is identified by&#13;
village. The only problem is the issue of Thriposha for which a scheme would need to be devised.&#13;
15.        The M/PPI survey of 1993 reported that "50% of mothers are visited regularly (once or&#13;
twice a month) by the PHM at home during their pregnancy, but close to 25% are never visited by a&#13;
midwife."" (Including other surveys the range would be 15-25%.) While this calls for closer&#13;
supervision of home visits, the availability of clinic services in urban areas and PHM vacancies may&#13;
also contribute to this percentage. The importance of home visits is that the personal family contact&#13;
provides an ideal opportunity for discussion, advice and encouragement on individual problems as&#13;
well as on matters pertaining to health.&#13;
16.        An aspect of matemal care at "health centers"/clinics that needs to be reiterated is the&#13;
lack of focus on weight gain during pregnancy, which is an important aspect of matemal nutrition.&#13;
The M/PPI survey of 1993 revealed that "over two thirds of mothers do not know how much weight&#13;
they gained during their last pregnancy. This was because scales were either not available at clinics&#13;
or, even when they were, there is no regular monitoring of weight gain during pregnancy." The FH&#13;
Bureau has now included a basic "weight gain chart" in the "Mothers record", but the focus on&#13;
weight gain in pregnancy still leaves much to be desired.&#13;

HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Malaria Component&#13;
A. Background - Malaria in Sri Lanka&#13;
EvidemioloMy&#13;
1.         Malaria is a serious public health problem in Sri Lanka. In 1987, the peak year of a&#13;
recent epidemic, it was the leading cause of hospitalization in the country. In each of the subsequent&#13;
six years 1988 to 1993, it has been either the fourth or fifth leading cause of hospitalization, and the&#13;
cause of an average 110 hospital deaths per year. The in-patient admission rate and death rate for the&#13;
country as a whole have remained relatively constant over the last few years at approximately seven&#13;
admissions per 1,000 population and 0.05 deaths per 10,000 population. In 1993, 5% of hospital&#13;
admissions were due to malaria. The low case fatality rate for malaria (currently less than 0.1%) is a&#13;
tribute to the quality of the Sri Lankan health care system.&#13;
2.         Malaria transmission is not uniform over the island of Sri Lanka. Incidence is higher in&#13;
the provinces which are situated in the dry and intermediate climatic zones of the country.&#13;
Approximately 4 million people live in the malarious part of the country. In six high incidence&#13;
districts within these provinces, hospital admission rates were all higher than for the country as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
Parasitology&#13;
3.         Data from hospital admissions do not indicate the number of persons infected with&#13;
malaria in the country, since they do not include all the persons treated as outpatients or those who do&#13;
not receive any treatment. In theory, all persons who present with fever to medical institutions have a&#13;
blood slide taken for confirmation of malaria parasites, and the blood slide results are the basis of the&#13;
statistics collected by the Anti-Malaria Campaign (AMC). However, this procedure may not be&#13;
followed consistently depending on the clinic workload. In addition, some medical institutions at the&#13;
periphery do not have blood slide facilities; nor do private physicians who serve an increasing&#13;
proportion of the out-patient population (currently estimated to be about 50%). It is thought that&#13;
because of these undocumented cases, the incidence of malaria is underestimated by 2 to 6 times,&#13;
depending on the district.&#13;
4.         In Sri Lanka as a whole, the data show that there have been two separate malaria&#13;
epidemics since 1986 (Table 1). The highest epidemic peak was in 1987 at 42.0 cases/l,000 persons,&#13;
followed by a smaller epidemic peaking at 23.2 cases/I,000 persons in 1991. During the years 1988&#13;
and 1989, civil strife in the country caused a disruption in the health services as well as malaria&#13;
control operations which is reflected in a decline in the number of blood slides examined during those&#13;
years. However, it appears that there was a true decline in cases in those years because the slide&#13;
positivity rate was also lower than in 1987 and 1991. The incidence remained stable at over 20 per&#13;
1,000 persons through 1992 and 1993 but appears to have commenced a slow decline in 1994. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
both 1987 and 1991, P.vivax predominated over Pfalciparum, particularly in the more recent&#13;
epidemic, in which P.falciparum was also slower to gain momentum, peaking in 1992 rather than in&#13;
1991. At the peak in 1987, the number of cases/1,000 was similar to the numbers experienced in&#13;
previous epidemics in 1968-70 and 1973, but an order of magnitude lower than the annual incidence&#13;
of 100-400/1,000 typically seen in the 1930s and 1940s prior to initiation of DDT spraying in 1945.&#13;

Population per district from Annual Health Bulletin, projected from 1981 census.&#13;
SPR: Slide positivity rate (percent of slides which were positive for any malaria species).&#13;
ABER: Annual blood examination rate (number of slides examined per year divided by total&#13;
population).&#13;
API: Annual parasite incidence (number of positive slides per thousand persons per year).&#13;
5.         Basing conclusions about malaria on the average annual incidence can be somewhat&#13;
deceptive, because in fact transmission is highly seasonal in Sri Lanka. There are usually two peak&#13;
periods of incidence, the largest one corresponding to the North East Monsoon (November to January)&#13;
and a smaller peak after the South West Monsoon (April to June). The second peak may be absent&#13;
altogether, as happened in several districts in 1994.&#13;
Age/Sex Distribution&#13;
6.         Since Sri Lanka is an area of unstable malaria, adults do not have high levels of&#13;
immunity and often suffer from symptoms when infected, unlike the situation in highly endemic areas.&#13;
However, the highest incidence rates are in children. Over the last nine years the pattern of age-&#13;
specific incidence in the country as a whole has changed. In 1986 through 1990, incidence rates were&#13;
lowest in infants &lt;1 year-old, increased sharply to 20-30 per 1,000 in the 1-4 year olds, and then&#13;
showed a gradual slight decline through the older age groups. In 1992-1994, the flat curve has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
changed to a bimodal curve with highest incidence rates in the I to 4 year olds and the 10 to 14 year&#13;
olds. Given the greater likelihood of mosquito exposure in adults (who are more likely to be sitting&#13;
outside or guarding crops at night) higher incidence rates in children indicate a possible significant&#13;
role of protective immunity in the Sri Lankan population. It is possible that the recent decreased&#13;
incidence in 5 to 9 year olds is a result of their having been infected as younger children in the 1987&#13;
epidemic. However, differences between age-groups in their (or their parents') tendency to seek&#13;
medical treatment must also be taken into account.&#13;
7.         It has long been known that the incidence of malaria is higher in males than females in&#13;
Sri Lanka, and the explanations proposed for this phenomenon range from greater exposure in males&#13;
to lower health-seeking behavior in women. While there have been more cases in males than females&#13;
in the last nine years, the excess has been decreasing since 1987 (when the ratio of cases in&#13;
men:women was 1.37:1) to a ratio of 1.13:1 in 1994. In the particular districts reviewed in this report,&#13;
the ratios in the last three years have been close to 1: 1, with the exception of Polonnaruwa where the&#13;
ratio has increased from 1.32:1 in 1992 to 1.59:1 in 1994.&#13;
Entomology&#13;
8.         The intensity of malaria transmission varies within the country and within the year&#13;
according to the distribution and density of the anopheline vectors which in turn depends on the&#13;
rainfall. The country is divided into three zones according to rainfall: wet (&gt;2,500 mm per year),&#13;
intermediate (2,000-2,500 mm per year) and dry (&lt;2,000 mm per year) and conditions are most&#13;
favorable for anopheline breeding in the dry and intermediate zones. The highest densities of vectors&#13;
occur towards the end of and after the two monsoon seasons (November-January and April-June),&#13;
because the river-bed pools which form as the volume of flow decreases are favored breeding sites.&#13;
9.         There are 22 species of anopheline mosquitoes in Sri Lanka, of which 13 have been&#13;
shown to be possible vectors of malaria. Only three of these species are thought to play an important&#13;
role in malaria transmission. Anopheles culicifacies has long been known to be major vector of&#13;
malaria in Sri Lanka, but recently An. subpictus and An. annularis have been recognized as significant&#13;
vectors in some seasons and districts. Ecological changes occurring due to major irrigation schemes&#13;
such as that in the Mahaweli river basin apparently favor the breeding of the latter two species. All&#13;
sectors in Sri Lanka have relatively low human biting rates (usually less than 10 bites per person per&#13;
night, although numbers approaching 100 have been recorded) compared to highly endemic areas such&#13;
as Africa and Papua New Guinea. None of the Sri Lankan vectors shows a high preference for&#13;
feeding on human rather than animal blood; even the most important vector An. culicifacies takes&#13;
about half of its blood meals from cattle or other animals. All vectors also prefer to bite outdoors&#13;
rather than indoors. Where sporozoite rates in mosquitoes have been examined, they have generally&#13;
have been found to be quite low (less than 1%), but in certain situations very high rates up to 9.6%&#13;
have been reported.&#13;
10.        The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) is the key parameter which indicates the risk of&#13;
malaria infection in humans. It is the number of potentially infectious bites which each person&#13;
receives per night, and is derived from the product of the sporozoite rate (mosquito infection rate) and&#13;
the bites per person per night. The generally low biting rate of Sri Lankan vectors means that&#13;
entomological inoculation rates are also usually low; thus accounting for the marginal and unstable&#13;
nature of malaria transmission in the country. However, if sporozoite rates in mosquitoes rise to levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
of over 1%, then even if a person only receives 10 bites per night he or she will still receive an&#13;
infectious bite once in every 10 days. Entomological inoculation rates as high as I infectious bite per&#13;
person per night have been reported in some studies in recent years. This aspect of malaria&#13;
epidemiology in Sri Lanka deserves much further study.&#13;
B. The Anti-Malaria Campaign&#13;
11.         At the level of the Ministry of Health, all preventive health programs including malaria&#13;
control activities are the responsibility of the Deputy Director General-Public Health Services&#13;
(DDGPHS). From the time of establishment in 1910 until the introduction of Provincial Councils in&#13;
1989, the AMC has been responsible for the planning, implementation and evaluation of all malaria&#13;
control activities. The network available for the provision of primary health care services did not have&#13;
any responsibilities for malaria control. For purposes of implementing malaria control activities, the&#13;
island was divided into 17 "regions", depending on the endemicity and population. Each region had a&#13;
Regional Malaria Officer (RMO) who was responsible for all malaria control activities of the region,&#13;
to the Director, AMC. A "region" identified for malaria control usually corresponds with a "district"&#13;
(administrative unit), with a few exceptions.&#13;
12.         Provision of health services, including malaria control, became the responsibility of the&#13;
Provincial Council effective March 1989. Following this major change in the organization of the&#13;
health services, the responsibilities of the AMC and the staff at provincial/regional level were&#13;
demarcated, with the bulk of technical and monitoring activities assigned to the Directorate and the&#13;
majority of implementation/administration and training activities assigned to the provinces.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
13.         At present, the staff for malaria control activities are available at:&#13;
(a)   National Level: The staff at the AMC Directorate include: Director, Deputy Director,&#13;
Medical Officers (3), Entomologists (2) and other technical and non-technical support&#13;
staff.&#13;
(b)   Regional Level: At regional level, the RMO coordinates malaria control activities and&#13;
has the following categories of staff to assist in his or her activities: field assistants&#13;
(FA); microscopists at the Regional laboratory; entomological teams - I entomological&#13;
assistant, 2 FAs, 5 spray machine operators (SMO) and 1 driver; mobil teams - each&#13;
team includes I FA, 1 Microscopist, I SMO and I driver.&#13;
(c)   Divisional Level: The DDHS and his staff are responsible to the DPDHS and PD for the&#13;
implementation of malaria control activities within the health area. The role of the RMO&#13;
is to coordinate, monitor and provide technical guidance to the malaria control activities&#13;
in the region which includes a varying number of DDHS areas.&#13;
14.        In a DDHS area, the Public Health Inspector (PHI) is the person who is responsible for&#13;
the control of communicable diseases, so the malaria control activities come under his purview.&#13;
However, in most of the DDHS areas, a separate PHI for malaria control activities is available. The&#13;
other categories of field staff in a DDHS area, namely Public Health Nursing Sisters (PHNSs) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
Public Health Midwives (PHMs) also contribute to malaria control activities through their participation&#13;
in health educational activities and supplying chemoprophylaxis to pregnant women, in clinics and at&#13;
field level. The field assistants responsible for activated passive case detection and the microscopists&#13;
working in the institutions of the DDHS area also come under the supervision of the DDHS. A&#13;
varying number of spray teams, each of which includes I FA and 4 SMOs, are also attached to a&#13;
DDHS area.&#13;
Implementation of the Global Malaria Control Strategy&#13;
15.        In June 1993, the AMC made a policy decision to implement the WHO "Global Malaria&#13;
Control Strategy," which includes the following:&#13;
(a)   early detection and prompt treatment of malaria cases;&#13;
(b)   selective application of sustainable malaria control measures including vector control;&#13;
(c)   development of mechanisms to forecast/prevent malaria epidemics and outbreaks;&#13;
(d)  regular assessment of the country's malaria control program.&#13;
The supervision an coordination of the malaria control activities are presently being carried out in the&#13;
following manner.&#13;
16.        Case detection and treatment. These are being performed via Activated Passive Case&#13;
Detection, done by FA/APCD at different levels of medical institutions; Active Case Detection, done&#13;
by fever surveys and mass blood examinations; and mobile clinics. Case detection program other than&#13;
APCD are organized and supervised by the RMO, in collaboration with the DDHS. The "incidence"&#13;
data available from these sources are made available to the DDHS and to the RMO, for monitoring&#13;
purposes.&#13;
17.        A treatment schedule has been drawn up by the AMC directorate taking into account the&#13;
species distribution of malaria cases and other practical considerations. Officers at all medical&#13;
institutions are informed of the need to adhere to this treatment schedule. With the emergence of drug&#13;
resistance, it is the AMC policy to prescribe the second line drug, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine&#13;
(Fansidar) only to those patients who were shown to have drug resistance. The issue of this drug is&#13;
presently being "controlled" by the AMC. The RMO has the responsibility of issuing this drug to&#13;
institutions on request. There appears to have been a marked increase in the level of chloroquine&#13;
resistance in 1992, and now approximately 40-50% of tested isolates were resistant in vitro, and 16-&#13;
17% showed the highest level of resistance in vivo. Resistance to Fansidar, mefloquine and quinine&#13;
does not seem to have appeared yet.&#13;
18.        Insecticide spraying. Indoor house spraying with residual insecticides has been the&#13;
mainstay of malaria control in Sri Lanka for almost 50 years. Spraying with DDT was started in 1945&#13;
and continued for 12 years, by which time malaria had fallen to almost non-existent levels. It was&#13;
restarted in 1968 during a P. vivax epidemic but was phased out after the appearance of DDT resistance&#13;
and then replaced by malathion by 1978. Selective spraying of insecticides was introduced in mid-&#13;
1993. Using the data available, the RMO (in consultation with the DDHS of the area) is expected to&#13;
identify areas that require perennial spraying, seasonal spraying and focal spraying. The present policy&#13;
of the AMCs to use different insecticides "in rotation," to minimize development of resistance. Spray&#13;
teams are a part of the DDHS staff, hence the supervision of spraying activities is the direct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
responsibility of the PHI (malaria control) or PHI of the area, with DDHS having an overall&#13;
responsibility. All workers who are involved in spraying of insecticides are provided with protective&#13;
clothing including caps, masks, etc. Their health is regularly monitored and periodic blood&#13;
examinations are undertaken.&#13;
19.        Since the implementation of selective spraying, the amount of malathion used in the&#13;
country as a whole has declined from over 1,000,000 kg in 1989 to 274,311 kg in 1994, while the&#13;
coverage of houses targeted to receive malathion has improved from 54% to 63.5%. In 1994,&#13;
fenitrothion and ICON were used. These insecticides are more expensive than malathion, but&#13;
acceptance is much greater: 69.7% and 74.2% of houses targeted for fenitrothion and ICON&#13;
respectively were fully sprayed. Monitoring of insecticide resistance is done on a regular basis by&#13;
entomological teams who conduct standardized susceptibility tests with different anopheline species to&#13;
detect the evolution of insecticide resistance. They also conduct bioassay tests in which mortality of&#13;
mosquitoes exposed to walls in sprayed houses is measured; these tests are designed to monitor the&#13;
operational activities of the spray teams.&#13;
20.        Larval control measures. In selected areas especially where there is a seasonal increase&#13;
in the breeding places, larval control measures are undertaken, the commonest being the use of&#13;
"Abate" (temephos). The decision to undertake larval control measures is taken by the RMO at the&#13;
request of the DDHS.&#13;
21.        Entomological surveillance. The entomological teams based at regional level are&#13;
responsible for the activities of monitoring the vector density, perfornance of the spraying teams,&#13;
resistance to insecticides and identifying possible changes in the vector species composition or habits.&#13;
The teams are supervised and monitored on a day-to-day basis by the RMO. The senior entomologist&#13;
and his staff at the AMC are responsible for the technical monitoring of the entomological surveillance&#13;
data, at national level.&#13;
22.        Promoting personal protective measures through health education and community&#13;
participation. The activities include: promotion of use of permethrin impregnated bed nets and&#13;
programs aimed at reduction of breeding places. The PHI is responsible for organization of these&#13;
programs in collaboration with the other health staff of the area and is supervised by the DDHS.&#13;
However, in practice the RMO also acts in a supervisory capacity for such programs.&#13;
Finances of the Anti-Malaria Campaign&#13;
23.        Malaria control activities always receive priority over all other community health&#13;
programs in making budgetary decisions. In 1989, the Ministry of Health allocated 62.2% of the total&#13;
expenditure on community health services and 11.6% of the total health budget for the AMC. From&#13;
1990 onwards, however, with the decentralization, a proportion of allocations which were previously&#13;
made to the AMC is diverted to Provincial Health Ministries. Malaria control activities are now&#13;
integrated with other community health programs, but the provincial health authorities have not yet&#13;
been able to develop an accounting system to distinguish expenditure on malaria control from other&#13;
health activities. Until decentralization, AMC used to spend about 60% of its total expenditure for the&#13;
purchase of malathion alone. Personal emoluments and traveling accounted for another 20%.&#13;
&#13;

C. Project Content&#13;
24.        With the adoption of the WHO revised malaria strategy in 1993, the Anti-Malaria&#13;
Campaign (AMC) is moving towards an approach to the malaria problem in Sri Lanka that will utilize&#13;
all suitable techniques in a coordinated manner to (i) reduce the vector population while protecting the&#13;
environment; and (ii) improve treatment and promote personal protection. Details of the program to&#13;
be implemented over the project period are given below. The recommendations of the expert team&#13;
that carried out a review of the AMC program in July 1995 have been taken into account.&#13;
1. Program Management&#13;
Coordination. To improve coordination and exchange of information and experiences&#13;
among the regional (district) level malaria programs as well as the flow of data to the&#13;
central AMC, a meeting of all Regional Malaria Officers (RMOs) will be held twice a&#13;
year at the AMC Directorate. In addition, a review meeting with the participation of&#13;
AMC officers and the RMOs of the six high-prevalence districts will be held once a&#13;
quarter in one of districts, on a rotating basis.&#13;
Planning. The RMOs have received training, with WHO participation, in the formulation&#13;
of annual regional (district) plans of action for malaria control. These plans will&#13;
incorporate annual district targets.&#13;
Reporting. The regional (district) malaria offices will be provided with computer&#13;
facilities to facilitate collection, collation and analysis of data. Provision of data to the&#13;
AMC on a prompt and regular basis will be emphasized.&#13;
2. Early Diagnosis and Prompt Treatment of Malaria Cases&#13;
Mobile clinics. Mobile clinics have already been introduced in four of the six high-&#13;
prevalence districts (Matale, Polunnaruwa, Kurunegala and Anuradhapura) and with&#13;
project support will be extended to the two remaining districts (Puttalam and&#13;
Moneragala). Using suitably equipped vans, mobile teams that include a microscopist&#13;
cover outlying rural areas systematically. Blood slides are taken from all fever cases in a&#13;
local area, examined on the spot, and if the results are positive the appropriate drugs are&#13;
given and the treatment regime explained. The importance of seeking diagnosis for any&#13;
future occurrences of fever is emphasized. Two mobile teams per district for the&#13;
remaining high-prevalence districts will be provided.&#13;
When an annual parasite incidence of 8 cases per thousand population is achieved in a&#13;
given district, one of the mobile clinics assigned to the district will be reassigned. The&#13;
remaining mobile clinics will be withdrawn when the annual parasite incidence declines&#13;
to 4 cases per thousand. However, mobile clinics will continue to function in localities&#13;
where the P. falciparum percentage is recorded to be more than 10% of the total number&#13;
of malaria cases and in localities which are identified to be foci of P. falciparum.&#13;
Support for ambulances for transport of falciparum cases and other medical emergencies&#13;
would be conditional on a review of transport aspects of the health system that would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 8 of 10&#13;
indicate the justification in cost-effectiveness terms for the type and number of vehicles&#13;
needed and address sustainability issues.&#13;
Treatment at health facilities. The program will put increasing emphasis on expanding&#13;
and improving the treatment available at health facilities. An improved treatment&#13;
schedule has been provided to all health facilities. Provision for microscopic examination&#13;
of blood films of suspected malaria cases will be expanded by the recruitment and&#13;
training of 100 microscopists over the project period, all of whom will be assigned to&#13;
health facilities rather than regional laboratories. As the number of microscopists&#13;
increases, it will be possible to work towards the goal of taking blood films from all&#13;
suspected cases, thus reducing the level of presumptive treatment. During the off-season,&#13;
when microscopists will have less facility work, they will be utilized to examine blood&#13;
films taken during special parasite surveys.&#13;
Identification and follow-up of drug-resistant cases. Monitoring of drug resistance will&#13;
be increased and organized more effectively. This will be done by designating sentinel&#13;
facilities to do intensified surveillance of treatment failures and report them to the DDHS&#13;
and the regional (district) malaria office. The RMOs will be given responsible for&#13;
monitoring drug resistance in their areas.&#13;
Quality control. To ensure quality in the case detection system, the cross-checking&#13;
system will be reintroduced at the regional (district) level, under the technical guidance&#13;
of the AMC. High-quality binocular microscopes will be supplied for the purpose.&#13;
Small-scale cross-checking will also be introduced at the AMC Directorate.&#13;
Role of PHMs. Malaria prophylaxis for pregnant women is already one of the&#13;
responsibilities of PHMs. Their role in local detection and treatment of malaria cases&#13;
will be expanded, although it is recognized that they have many duties and that they&#13;
should not be expected to take on a curative role. Training will be provided to PHMs&#13;
and their supervisors in the high-prevalence districts to ensure that their knowledge about&#13;
malaria and the drug treatment regime is up to date and to involve them in promoting the&#13;
use of impregnated bed nets and community malaria prevention measures. Existing&#13;
community/NGO health volunteers will also be oriented.&#13;
3. Selected and Sustainable Malaria Control Methods&#13;
Targeting of spraving. With the introduction of the revised WHO strategy, the&#13;
insecticide spraying program has been drastically modified. With the introduction of&#13;
targeted rather than blanket spraying, the total amount of insecticide used has been&#13;
significantly reduced, and this decline is expected to continue as spraying becomes more&#13;
selective. Additional insecticides have been introduced to supplement malathion, both to&#13;
reduce the risk of the development of resistance and because the new insecticides are less&#13;
toxic than malathion.&#13;
Bed net program. Insecticide-impregnated bed nets are an effective, cost-effective and&#13;
sustainable method of personal protection that can be promoted with community support.&#13;
With project support, the program will be expanded and implemented in all six high-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
prevalence districts. NGO support will be sought for a pilot effort to provide net&#13;
material at cost and pay community organizations for making the nets.&#13;
4. Regular Assessment of Malaria Status and Prevention of Epidemics&#13;
Entomological surveillance. To enable increased and strengthened entomological&#13;
surveillance, larger vehicles, capable of transporting at least nine people, will be&#13;
obtained. At present, the work of the entomological teams is focused on assessing the&#13;
effectiveness of spraying and the level of insecticide resistance. These activities will&#13;
continue to be important, but with the reduction in spraying, the time and resources&#13;
required for them will be reduced. More effort will be given to the use of the&#13;
entomology teams as part of the early waming system and to gather useful&#13;
epidemiological information related to incidence data. To accomplish this, the following&#13;
will be done:&#13;
* better methods for assessing the biting risk to humans will be developed;&#13;
* capacity for determining sporozoite rates by ELISA will be established at regional&#13;
(district) level;&#13;
* better use of data that is collected will be made, so that the time between data&#13;
collection and response can be shortened.&#13;
Early waming system. At present, the system reacts to the incidence of infection, e.g. by&#13;
sending mobile clinics and entomology teams when an area reports a large number of&#13;
cases, rather than trying to preempt a potential epidemic. To enable the program to&#13;
move from cure to prevention, an early warning system for potential outbreaks of malaria&#13;
will be developed, based on parasitological, clinical and other epidemiological data taken&#13;
in conjunction with entomological data. The focus for the system will be at regional&#13;
(district) level, based on inputs from the divisional level. Training at both levels and the&#13;
hardware and software to handle the volume of data involved will be supported (see&#13;
above under Management). It is expected that the number of cases will continue to fall&#13;
for the foreseeable future. However, Sri Lanka will always be at high risk for malaria&#13;
epidemics, and in fact the risk level will increase as prevalence, and therefore immunity,&#13;
wanes. Therefore, the early warning system must be developed and sustained even when&#13;
prevalence is low.&#13;
Prevalence surveys. Baseline prevalence surveys will be carried out in the six high-&#13;
prevalence districts in early 1996. Subsequent follow-up surveys will be carried out at&#13;
two-year intervals.&#13;
5. Community Awareness and Participation. As noted above, NGO/community volunteers will&#13;
receive program orientation as part of the training to be undertaken for the program with project&#13;
support. IEC efforts will focus on promotion of the importance of personal protection, especially the&#13;
use of impregnated bed nets, and of seeking diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible for any fever&#13;
that might be malaria. Promotion of these messages will be particular important as mobile clinics are&#13;
withdrawn.&#13;

6. ORerational Research. It may be desirable to incorporate additional physical and biological&#13;
controls into the program after their usefulness has been tested on a small scale. The project will&#13;
support such research, which has already been initiated by malaria officers in Matale and Kurunegala&#13;
districts. Some measures that have proven useful elsewhere may not be particularly suitable for Sri&#13;
Lanka. For example, larval control using fish is not likely to play a major role because of the large&#13;
number of temporary breeding sites that develop after the rainy seasons but subsequently dry up.&#13;
However, the use of BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) and nematodes for vector control in&#13;
situations such as gem pits in Matale and Ratnapura districts, will be tested.&#13;

HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
STD/AIDS Component&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.         Reports of HIV seropositivity among five prostitutes in Madras in 1985 first alerted the&#13;
Ministry of Health to the danger of HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka. The first case of AIDS was detected&#13;
in a foreign visitor to Sri Lanka in November 1986, and the first Sri Lankan with AIDS was&#13;
diagnosed in April 1987. As of January 1996, 171 WHV-positive individuals had been identified. Of&#13;
these, 58 had developed AIDS and 49 had died. The first few detections were mainly homosexuals&#13;
or bisexuals, but by 1989 it had become increasingly evident that the predominant mode of&#13;
transmission was heterosexual. Indigenous transmission was first documented in December 1989&#13;
and since then has been increased steadily.&#13;
2.         HIV/AIDS prevention and control were integrated into the existing STD Control&#13;
Programme in 1985. An AIDS Task Force was established in May 1986 chaired by the Director&#13;
General of Health Services, comprising mainly Ministry of Health staff with representation from&#13;
the Tourist Board, the Police and the Ministry of Education. The Task Force was expanded to form&#13;
the multi-disciplinary multi-sectoral National AIDS Committee in February 1988.&#13;
3.         HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities commenced in earnest with the assistance&#13;
of WHO consultants, who developed a Short-Term Plan (STP) of Action in July 1987. Baseline&#13;
serological surveys were conducted among the high risk groups, and a knowledge, attitude, behavior&#13;
and practices (KAP) survey was carried out. The blood supply was secured and the laboratory&#13;
services were strengthened. A first Medium-Term Plan (MTP I) was developed, funded primarily&#13;
by UNDP. An external review of the program was conducted in November/December 1993,&#13;
followed by a National Consensus Workshop.&#13;
4.         The report of the Presidential Task Force on Formulation of a National Health Policy&#13;
for Sri Lanka (July 1992) specifically identified WHV/AIDS as a major health problem and made&#13;
recommendations on policies to be adopted to address the potential medical, social and economic&#13;
impacts. The policies reflect the Government's non-discriminatory attitude and its commitment to a&#13;
multi-sectoral approach.&#13;
B. Epidemiology of STDs&#13;
5.         In 1991 WHO estimated that there are more than 200,000 new STD cases each year,&#13;
but in fact the incidence of STDs in Sri Lanka is not known. In recent years, the Central Clinic in&#13;
Colombo has seen about 5,000 new cases of STDs a year and about 18,000 total visits. The&#13;
provincial clinics, mostly located in provincial hospitals, are thought to see another 5,000 new cases&#13;
annually, although since the provincialization of the health services in 1989 reporting from the&#13;
provincial clinics has become irregular and unreliable. If the WHO estimate is accepted, then the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
government clinics are seeing only about 5% of total cases.&#13;
6.         Gonococcal infections and chlamydia have shown a downward trend in recent years.&#13;
Syphilis, herpes simplex infections and genital warts, however, have shown a rise as a percentage of&#13;
diagnosed cases, as have chlamydia and trichomoniasis. For ante-natal clinic (ANC) attendees in&#13;
Colombo, the VDRL positivity rate was less than 2%. However, ANC syphilis serology coverage is&#13;
incomplete.&#13;
7.         Lower socio-economic groups, such as unskilled workers and street hawkers in&#13;
Colombo and drivers, sailors, military and police in the provinces, account for a significant number&#13;
of STD cases. Usually these are unmarried males and females. Female sex workers are about a&#13;
third of clinic attendees in Colombo. More than 70% of male patients reported female sex workers&#13;
as the source of infection. About 30% of patients are treated for repeat infections. More than 70%&#13;
of female sex workers tested had an STD infection, and more than 45% of the them had more than&#13;
one infection.&#13;
B. Status of HIV/AIDs&#13;
8.         Although there is a consensus that HIV prevalence is still quite low in Sri Lanka and&#13;
that major epidemic spread of HIV has not yet occurred, the true prevalence of HIV is not known.&#13;
Estimates range up to as high as 5,000. The situation has not been clarified by the sentinel surveys&#13;
that have been undertaken. Surveys have been carried out in 1991, 1994 and 1995. The results&#13;
from the 1994 and 1995 surveys are summarized below:&#13;
1994                  1995&#13;

Total              5,212        0        9,971        2&#13;
9.         The results of the first two surveys reported so few HIV positives that the results were&#13;
not considered credible, and particular care was therefore taken with the third survey. The low&#13;
numbers of HIV positives for female commercial sex workers and for STD patients, the two major&#13;
risk categories in Sri Lanka, do not support high estimates for HIV prevalence. As in other Asian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
countries where the numbers of persons at high risk of HIV infection are relatively small at present,&#13;
the sentinel surveys carried out in Sri Lanka have included many individuals not at high risk, and&#13;
the results have reported only small numbers of HIV positives. In retrospect, it is unfortunate that&#13;
the survey design was not modified to concentrate on high and highest risk groups. Prior to the 1996&#13;
sentinel survey, the survey design will be reviewed, and testing for other STDs as feasible will also&#13;
be incorporated.&#13;
10.        It is generally agreed that in Sri Lanka heterosexual transmission, is currently, and will&#13;
continue to be, the primary mode of the spread of HIV. Other sources of transmission that have&#13;
played significant roles in HIV epidemics elsewhere include contaminated syringes and needles used&#13;
by injecting drug users; contaminated blood products; perinatal transmission; and accidental&#13;
infection of health workers during clinical procedures with HIV-infected patients. However, none of&#13;
these factors is important in Sri Lanka at present: there is little injecting drug use, the blood supply&#13;
has been carefully secured, and there are too few HIV-infected individuals to bring the latter two&#13;
into play.&#13;
11.        The critical determinant of the spread of HIV and other STDs, therefore, is the sexual&#13;
practices among the heterosexual community. If only a very small percentage of the population&#13;
have multiple sex partners, then the at-risk population groups will also be very small and spread of&#13;
the epidemic will be limited even if the multiple sex partner group is substantially infected. Within&#13;
the at-risk group, the secondary determinant is "safe sex" practices, primarily use of condoms.&#13;
12.        The evidence currently available suggests that in fact the proportion of persons with&#13;
multiple sex partners in Sri Lanka is quite low. A recent studyl/ reached the following&#13;
conclusions about potential high-risk groups.&#13;
(a)   Free trade zone workers (75,000): not a high-risk group; little evidence of promiscuous&#13;
sexual behavior; none of the respondents had casual sexual partners; all respondents&#13;
had heard of AIDS and were generally well informed about different modes of HIV&#13;
transmission, although much less well informed about other STDs.&#13;
(b)   Overseas retumees (288,000, or about 3% of the potential work force): small but non-&#13;
trivial risk for HIV infections, primarily because of possible sexual exploitation by&#13;
employers; 20% reported sexual harassment, a smaller percentage casual partnerships;&#13;
also well informed about HIV/AIDS and transmission, much less so about other STDs.&#13;
(c)   Commercial sex workers (12,000): high risk of infection and therefore of transmitting&#13;
it to clients; very few male sex workers or low-class female sex workers reported using&#13;
condoms regularly; by contrast, nearly 87% of high-class female sex workers reported&#13;
that they did.&#13;
(d)   Prison populations (20,000): high-risk group because of relatively high level of casual&#13;
sexual activity, including commercially available sex and homosexual contacts;&#13;

Page 4 of 12&#13;
condoms generally unavailable.&#13;
(e)   Tourist inflows: unlikely to contribute significantly to transmission of HIV among Sri&#13;
Lankan nationals.&#13;
13.        Other behavioral research on STD and AIDs risk-related behaviors in Sri Lanka2/ has&#13;
concluded that unemployed, unmarried youth are a risk group that should be given additional&#13;
attention.&#13;
14.        Although it is not known why HIV has not yet spread extensively in many Asian&#13;
countries including Sri Lanka, while in others (Thailand, Myanmar, India, Cambodia and perhaps&#13;
Vietnam) spread is now exponential. However, the relative intensity of high-risk behaviors is&#13;
clearly a major factor. If multiple partner sexual contacts are low and condom use is promoted, as&#13;
appears to be the case in Sri Lanka, then the potential for rapid spread of HIV is also low.&#13;
However, since the opposite is also the case, Sri Lanka must make maintenance and improvement of&#13;
this situation an immediate and continuing priority. To support this priority, patterns of relevant&#13;
behavior in the population will be monitored by systematic and routine sentinel behavioral surveys&#13;
similar to sentinel HIV surveys.&#13;
C. The National STD/AIDS Control Program&#13;
15.        The National STD/AIDS Control Program (NSACP) employs three major prevention&#13;
strategies in its efforts to prevent the spread of HIV infection: (i) prevention of sexual transmission;&#13;
(ii) prevention of transmission through blood; and (iii) prevention of perinatal transmission, as&#13;
follows.&#13;
I. PREVENTION OF SEXUAL TRANSMISSION&#13;
16.       Interventions increasing awareness and knowledge of STD/HIV and safer sex.&#13;
General public awareness of HIV/AIDS in 1989 was 14%; since then it has increased dramatically&#13;
to over 80%. Interventions to increase awareness and knowledge will focus on:&#13;
(a)  increasing the proportion of the knowledgeable population;&#13;
(b)  increasing depth of knowledge;&#13;
(c)  correcting misconceptions about STD/WilV;&#13;
(d)  making available information about all safer sex options;&#13;
(e)   desensitizing sex-related topics, including STD/AIDS and condoms;&#13;
(f)  eliminating any stigma attached to people with STD/HIV infections.&#13;
17.        The approaches to be adopted will be a mix of mass media communications reinforced&#13;
by support materials and interpersonal communications methods such as peer education, group&#13;
discussions, and one-on-one interactions including counselling. Traditional media such as street&#13;
plays and puppet shows will also be used as appropriate. Determining how and where to&#13;
communicate which messages will be based on audience research with respective target groups. In&#13;
2/ Center for Intersectoral Community Health Studies, University of Peradeniya, Kandy, Sri Lanka.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 5 of 12&#13;
light of past experience, it is critical that communications campaigns be sustained and followed up&#13;
in order to maximize their effectiveness. Interpersonal communication efforts and counseling will&#13;
be carried out primarily by NGOs, and mass media campaigns will be the responsibility primarily of&#13;
the Health Education Bureau (HEB) of the Ministry of Health. The NSACP with the assistance of&#13;
the HEB will coordinate the implementation and evaluation of STD/AIDS communication efforts&#13;
which, in addition to NGOs, will also involved several other govemnment ministries and the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
18.        Education of in-school youth through use of curricula that are honest, explicit and&#13;
comprehensive about the options available for preventing STD/HIV transmission is planned. The&#13;
curricula have been developed for grades 5-12 by the Health Education Bureau and the National&#13;
Institute of Education, MOE. NGOs such as the FPA have developed sexuality modules targeted at&#13;
grade 10 and above that have already been used in several districts. In addition, UNICEF will&#13;
support a project focusing on education of primary school children, youth and adolescents including&#13;
university students.&#13;
19.        Education of out-of-school youth, implemented through a collaborative effort between&#13;
the HEB, MOH and NYSC, will be continued to reach members of more than 5,000 youth clubs. In&#13;
addition, UNICEF will focus on girls working in Free Trade Zones, youth in the armed forces, and&#13;
sexually exploited children in "tourist areas".&#13;
20.        Messages to be pretested include the following:&#13;
(a)   What is an STD and how does it affect the individual?&#13;
(b)  What is HIV/AIDS and how does it affect the individual?&#13;
(c)   Behaviors not/leading to infection&#13;
(d)   Barriers to safer sexual behaviors&#13;
21.        Interventions promoting safer sexual behaviors. including condom use. As the number&#13;
of HIV-infected individuals continues to increase, more effort will be required to focus on the&#13;
adoption of safer sexual practices. This will include communication activities that motivate and&#13;
sustain behavior changes. These interventions will build on those outlined above relating to&#13;
strengthening awareness and knowledge.&#13;
22.        Of those who know that AIDS is transmitted sexually, only 5% report that they intend&#13;
to change their behavior (or have already done so), and in addition, only 5% report using condoms.&#13;
23.        Development of interventions will be guided by lessons learned from MTP I, including&#13;
taking existing lifestyles into account; bringing benefit and pleasure to the individual; linking&#13;
individual behavior change to changing social norms in the community, and findings about the&#13;
needs of each target group. A mix of the communication approaches will be employed.&#13;
Interventions will cover the following areas:&#13;
(a)   providing skills for correct condom use;&#13;
(b)   providing skills for increasing assertiveness and negotiating condom use and/or other&#13;
safer sexual practices;&#13;
(c)  increasing availability of good quality, low-cost condoms through expanding condom&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 6 of 12&#13;
social marketing and work place programs;&#13;
(d)  improving demand for and access to good quality, low-cost integrated STD/HIV&#13;
services that are acceptable to clients;&#13;
(e)  improving demand for and access to good quality, low-cost reproductive health services&#13;
(integration of FP/MCH and STD/HIV services).&#13;
24.        The primary message to be adapted to the needs of the different target groups on the&#13;
basis of qualitative research is the need to try and sustain safer sexual practices, including condom&#13;
use, mutual fidelity, non-penetrative sex, and abstinence.&#13;
25.        During MTP 1, the NSACP and some NGOs implemented pilot interventions to&#13;
motivate behavior change among male and female sex workers, and condom social marketing&#13;
undertaken by the FPA has increased condom availability to the general public. The NSACP will&#13;
now coordinate systematic efforts to increase adoption of safer sex which will be implemented by&#13;
numerous government and non-government agencies and the corporate sector.&#13;
26.        Interventions promoting STD care-seeking behavior. Sexual transmission has been&#13;
identified as the major factor in IfV spread . In Asia, including Sri Lanka, heterosexual&#13;
vaginal/anal intercourse seems to be the most dominant form of transmission. Available studies&#13;
indicate that sex workers account for nearly 70% of the infection and that about 70% of sex workers&#13;
are infected with STDs. Interventions promoting STD care-seeking behavior will on IEC efforts to&#13;
identify potential clients and inform them about STD care, it importance, and where to obtain&#13;
quality care. Other interventions will be formulated through a workshop. Methods of promoting&#13;
appropriate care-seeking behavior include among others, community initiatives, national and local&#13;
media campaigns, and education targeted at populations with risk behaviors. Since only 5-10% of&#13;
STD-infected individuals attend public clinics, it is essential that private facilities and physicians be&#13;
involved in these efforts.&#13;
27.        Interventions strengthening STD diagnosis and treatment. An effective HIV/AIDS&#13;
Control Program requires a well-established STD/AIDS care service supported by a well-organized&#13;
laboratory service. The Central Laboratory in Colombo is capable of performing several diagnostic&#13;
tests for STDs and HIV infections. The tests available outside Colombo are the venereal disease&#13;
research laboratory (VDRL) tests and microscopy.&#13;
28.        To strengthen quality of care and maximize coverage, the following interventions,&#13;
including provision of care at the primary health care level through syndromic approaches, will be&#13;
adopted:&#13;
(a)   Strenathening diagnostic facilities&#13;
(i) The Medical Research Institute of the Ministry of Health will provide the&#13;
services to the NSACP in the form of laboratory support for clinical management&#13;
of HIV infected persons. The services will include:&#13;
-  HIV culture capability;&#13;
- viral diagnostic service such as herpes, cytomegalo virus and hepatitis B;&#13;
-  bacteriological service for the detection of opportunistic infections;&#13;
-  diagnosis of parasitic and fungal infections;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 7 of 12&#13;
-  PCR on a selective basis;&#13;
-  automated CD4 cell counting with appropriate equipment and training;&#13;
-  establishment of an effective and comprehensive quality assessment scheme to&#13;
ensure standardized testing at all levels.&#13;
(ii) The existing facilities and capabilities in the Central Clinic will be improved&#13;
through the construction of a new facility. Expanded capacities and services will&#13;
include:&#13;
-  antigen testing for HIV on a selective basis;&#13;
-  confirmatory test for HIV 2;&#13;
-  cervical cytology;&#13;
-  MICs of N. gonorrhoea to be performed on a routine basis;&#13;
-  routine diagnosis of chlamydial infections;&#13;
-  urgent requirement to train a laboratory staff member as a maintenance officer&#13;
with the assurance that he/she will continue to work in the NSACP after the&#13;
training.&#13;
(iii)  STD/AIDS diagnostic facilities at the nine provincial hospitals will be&#13;
strengthened so that they will be capable of performing VDRL, TPHA,&#13;
gonococcal culture, HIV screening and microscopy. An internal quality&#13;
assurance scheme for the diagnostic laboratories will be established.&#13;
(b)   Undertaking clinical and laboratory studies focusing on the following&#13;
- asymptomatic women;&#13;
- rectal gonorrhoea among persons with STD/HIV, both males and females;&#13;
- serofast for syphilis;&#13;
- upper reproductive tract infections and foetal wastage due to STDs;&#13;
- MIC levels;&#13;
- plasmid analysis;&#13;
- HIV and HPV PCR studies.&#13;
(c)  Increasing expertise at all levels to improve counseling, contact tracing, partner&#13;
notification and where appropriate, provision of treatment.&#13;
29.        Interventions promoting reproductive health (RH). The definition of reproductive&#13;
health is broader than STD/AIDS control and prevention. A healthy genital tract is usually required&#13;
for pregnancy and delivery. Since a diseased genital tract either from AIDS, STD or the&#13;
complications of these conditions can prevent pregnancy and the reproductive function, the aims of&#13;
maintaining RH coincide with those of STD/AIDS control.&#13;
30.        Promotion of RH services will among the areas included in IEC efforts. Potential&#13;
clients will be informed of what RH care consists of, its importance, and where to obtain quality&#13;
care. Other interventions will be formulated through a workshop. Methods of promoting&#13;
appropriate RH care will include community initiatives, national and local media campaigns and&#13;
education targeted at sexually active women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 8 of 12&#13;
31.        Coordination of RH activities will be undertaken by the NSACP and the FHB, with the&#13;
support of agencies such as UNFPA, UNICEF and UNDP. Practices such as laboratory examination&#13;
of cervical smears taken from women having IUDs inserted should be made standard. In addition,&#13;
the NSACP will support expansion of condom social marketing, especially in rral areas.&#13;
II. PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSION THROUGH BLOOD&#13;
32.        Interventions ensuring safe blood. There are 46 outstation blood banks in the&#13;
country. The Central Blood Bank in Colombo is attached to the National Blood Transfusion Service&#13;
(NBTS). In addition, there are a few private blood banks operating as part of private hospitals or&#13;
separately collecting blood for sale. NBTS does not have any control over the activities of the&#13;
private blood banks. The exact number of these blood banks is not known.&#13;
33.        No cases of HIV infections have been reported following transfusions. One case of&#13;
transfusion-associated HIV infection has been reported after transfusion abroad. Strategies adopted&#13;
by the NBTS for "HlV-safe" blood are:&#13;
(a)   Safer donors&#13;
- voluntary non-remunerated donors&#13;
- donor selection, including self-deferral&#13;
- donor examination&#13;
(b)   Safer blood (and blood components)&#13;
- confidential unit exclusion&#13;
- screening blood for HIV antibodies&#13;
According to the statistics of the NBTS, 99.99% of the blood units donated in the country are&#13;
screened for WIV antibodies and HBs antigen.&#13;
34.        About 50% of the blood donations in the country are screened for HIV 1 and 2 in the&#13;
NSACP Central Laboratory using the ELISA technique. All outstation blood banks perform the&#13;
Serodia test for HIV 1 only. All HV antibody positive samples are confirmed by Westem Blot in&#13;
the Central Laboratory of the STD/AIDS Control Program for statistical reasons.&#13;
35.        Every effort will be taken to sustain and strengthen the existing activities of the NBTS&#13;
to prevent transmission of HIV infection through blood transfusion and transfusion of blood&#13;
components. Sustainability of the existing scheme will be ensured by providing training to all&#13;
categories of staff in the NBTS and continuous supply of sterile and disposable items used for blood&#13;
collection. Test reagents necessary for the continuous testing of all blood units for WHV 1 and 2&#13;
antibodies will be made available. Licensing procedures will be established for all private blood&#13;
banks to ensure safe practices and blood quality control.&#13;
36.        The following interventions have been identified:&#13;
- creating awareness among the medical staff about the risks of transfusion associated&#13;
infections in order to reduce the need for blood transfusion;&#13;
- preparing and distributing guidelines for blood transfusion practices to all medical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 9 of 12&#13;
officers;&#13;
- continuing donor selection strategies, blood testing procedures and training programs&#13;
at their fullest capacity.&#13;
37.         The policy for providing clotting factor products to hemophiliacs is satisfactory and&#13;
will be continued in its present form.&#13;
38.        Interventions preventing nosocomial transmission and other skin piercing&#13;
procedures. As an initial step to promote infection control, "Infection Control Guidelines" in the&#13;
health care setting have been prepared and circulated throughout the country. A total of 120&#13;
infection control nurses have been trained in groups and has been posted to all parts of the country.&#13;
As a result every General Hospital and many base hospitals have one or more trained infection&#13;
control nurses on their staff. These nurses are responsible for all infection control activities in the&#13;
hospital. The General Hospital in Colombo has an infection control team headed by the clinical&#13;
microbiologist in the hospital. No cases of HIV transmission have been reported from patient to&#13;
health care workers, from patient to patient or from health care workers to patient.&#13;
39.         Conditions, equipment, reagents and guidelines necessary for the practice of universal&#13;
safety precautions will be made available to all levels of health care workers. HCWs should be&#13;
continually made aware that any patient admitted to hospital has the potential to be infected with&#13;
HIV or any other blood-borne pathogen, irrespective of an HIV test result. Interventions foreseen&#13;
include the following: adequate supervision, awareness, continuous supply of necessary items, clear&#13;
guidelines and training available for the practice of universal safety precautions; and guidelines on&#13;
proper sterilization of endoscopes and other invasive instruments to be made available to all medical&#13;
officers. While emphasizing the need to manage HIV positive patients in the general wards,&#13;
isolation facilities for those with TB, severe diarrhea and mental disorders, should be made available&#13;
when necessary. Facilities for incineration or other method of safe waste disposal will be available.&#13;
A standard protocol will be developed on the plan of action to be followed in the event of an&#13;
accidental needle stick or any other injury to a health care women.&#13;
40.        Interventions promoting adoption of safer injecting drug use (IDU) practices.&#13;
During the MTP I there were no activities directed towards people injecting illicit drugs. However,&#13;
it is estimated that there are some 30,000 people in Sri Lanka who use illicit drugs, mainly via&#13;
inhalation, and there are reports of increased experimentation with injection.&#13;
41.         The NSACP will:&#13;
- monitor the situation and encourage research to identify existing or emerging IDU&#13;
activity and patterns;&#13;
- begin to include information about IDU as a means of HIV transmission in general&#13;
HIV/AIDS/STD programs and in drug information and control programs;&#13;
- initiate dialogue with key government and non-government agencies about&#13;
appropriate intervention strategies if required including:&#13;
* abstinence from drug use&#13;
* harm minimization models&#13;
* provision of sterile injecting equipment via pharmacies, needle exchange, informal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

networks&#13;
* provision of information to IDU about how to sterilize equipment&#13;
* encourage non-sharing of equipment&#13;
* collect information about successful IDU, HIV/AIDS/STD programs from other&#13;
countries (Asian and non-Asian)&#13;
III. PREVENTION OF PERINATAL TRANSMISSION&#13;
42.        Perinatal transmission from HIV positive mother to child has not been a problem in Sri&#13;
Lanka. To prevent future difficulties, the NSACP will take the following steps:&#13;
(a)   upgrade the infection control facilities of the hospitals and matemity homes;&#13;
(b) emphasize the risk of perinatal transmission in all HIV/AIDS awareness programs,&#13;
particularly in ANCs;&#13;
(c)   provide counseling services for HILV seropositive women and women at risk;&#13;
(d)   offer voluntary confidential HIV testing service to pregnant women.&#13;
43.        The policy of medical termination of pregnancy in HIV seropositive women may have&#13;
to be addressed in the future.&#13;
D. Project Inputs&#13;
Incinerators&#13;
44.        The project will support the construction of five incinerators for medical wastes&#13;
adjacent to but not attached to medical facilities in Colombo, including the new NSACP&#13;
headquarters building. For each site, a one cc foot incinerator will be constructed, which will be&#13;
sufficient to dispose of plastic syringes, some linen and gloves, etc. Firing will be by LPG gas&#13;
supplemented by air blowers. A 50-foot chimney will carry away exhaust gases, although it is&#13;
anticipated that due to the high combustion temperature there will be very little smoke.&#13;
DruRs&#13;
45.        The project will support drugs for the syndromic treatment of STDs. The following&#13;
drugs will be procured:&#13;
Erythromycin&#13;
Ciprofloxacin&#13;
Doxycycline&#13;
Caftriaxone&#13;
Cotrimoxazole&#13;
It is estimated that it will cost approximately Rs. 250 to treat an STD case syndromically and that&#13;
by the end of the project period approximately 10,000 cases a year will be treated syndromically&#13;
46.        AZT is intended to be used only in those few cases of HIV infection of health staff as&#13;
the result of needle sticks.&#13;

Condom Vending Machines&#13;
47.        Provision is made for procurement of 75 condom vending machines through UNFPA.&#13;
These machines will be placed at the disposal of and serviced by NGOs active in AIDS education&#13;
efforts who feel that when installed in appropriate locations the machines would be utilized by&#13;
groups with which they are working. It is expected that most machines would be located in areas of&#13;
high tourist interest, urban and industrial areas, and perhaps university areas.&#13;

SRI LANKA&#13;
HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Nutrition Component&#13;
A. Nutrition Issues in Sri Lanka&#13;
Low Birth Weight&#13;
1.         The weight of an infant at birth broadly reflects the quality of its intrauterine&#13;
development. Birth weight is an important predictor of the survival of the newbom. Studies have&#13;
also shown that low birth weight in full-term infants has a lasting deleterious impact on growth,&#13;
which even good diet and environment may not be able to reverse entirely. From a public health&#13;
point of view, the mean birth weight in a community may provide a broad indication of the quality&#13;
of matemal nutrition and ante-natal care that is available.&#13;
2.         The incidence of low birth weight in Sri Lanka, i.e. below 2,500 grains, is significant&#13;
and, what is more, does not appear to have declined in recent years. A study of 36,578 pregnant&#13;
women done by the Ministry of Health/CARE in 1984 gave the percentage of low birth-weight&#13;
births as 19%. Family Health Bureau data indicated an incidence of 23% for the 1986-89 period,&#13;
and a fuither study in 1989/90 reported 19% low-weight births, of which three quarters were full&#13;
term. The low birth-weight figures from the 1993 Demographic &amp; Health Survey and the 1993&#13;
Nutrition &amp; Health Survey were 19% and 20%, respectively. The DHS survey also reported that in&#13;
the estate sector, the incidence of low birth weight was close to 30%.&#13;
Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)&#13;
3.         The 1993 Demographic &amp; Health Survey reported the following levels of&#13;
malnourishment (below -2 standard deviations from the median of the reference population) for Sri&#13;
Lankan children 3-59 months of age: stunted (low weight for age), 23.7%; wasted (low weight for&#13;
height), 15.6%; and underweight (low weight for age), 37.6%. The National Health Survey, also&#13;
carried out in 1993, measured only underweight and reported 34.7% underweight (6.3% severely&#13;
and 28.4% moderately). The results of the two surveys, therefore are reassuringly consistent.&#13;
4.         The DHS data can also be compared to similar data from the 1987 DHS survey. The&#13;
two DHS and the NHS survey give the following percentages for underweight for children 3-35&#13;
months.&#13;
DHS1987    38.1%&#13;
DHS 1993    32.6%&#13;
DHS 1993    32.0%&#13;
These estimates suggest, first, that the level of malnutrition has declined somewhat since 1987; and&#13;
second, that the current level of malnutrition among children 3-35 months in Sri Lanka is close to a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74-                                      Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 15&#13;
third. The estimated levels for children 3-59 months are slightly higher (35-38%), as indicated&#13;
above. This is significantly lower than the comparable level of malnutrition for children 3-59&#13;
months in other south Asian countries (e.g. Pakistan 54%, Bangladesh 67% in recent surveys) but is&#13;
still strikingly high given the low level of mortality in Sri Lanka.&#13;
5.          The 1993 DHS data indicate a somewhat lower level of malnutrition (underweight) in&#13;
urban as compared to rural areas and a particularly high percentage among estate populations. The&#13;
contrast between wasting on the one hand and stunting/underweight on the other hand (10% vs 53-&#13;
54% among the estate populations is far greater than that in urban and other rural populations. The&#13;
most probably explanation for this phenomenon is that among estate women, almost all of whom&#13;
work, breast feeding and weaning habits are particularly detrimental, resulting for their infants in a&#13;
downward nutritional spiral likely to start as early as the second or third month and culminating in&#13;
stunting. However, because household cash income on estates does not vary much by season, there&#13;
is less likely to be short-term nutritional stress (wasting) than in other areas of the country.&#13;
6.          The monotonic decline in the percent of children underweight by increasing educational&#13;
level of the mother in the 1993 DHS data suggests a clear relationship between malnutrition and&#13;
poverty, and the same association emerges from analysis of the NHS data. However, the relatively&#13;
high level of malnutrition among the children of even quite educated women (25% for mothers with&#13;
more than secondary education in the DHS data) is unexpected and suggests that traditional beliefs&#13;
and practices and other cultural factors are also likely to play a large role in the persistence of high&#13;
levels of malnutrition in Sri Lanka.&#13;
7.          The pattern of increasing malnutrition, which becomes evident soon after birth and&#13;
becomes progressively greater until it starts to level off at about 18 months, as well as other&#13;
available evidence, suggests that infant and child feeding practices are in fact far from optimal in Sri&#13;
Lanka. Studies indicate that nearly 30% of infants are fed complementary liquids and solids within&#13;
the first four months of life, rather than being exclusively breast feed. But although many infants&#13;
receive complementary foods too early, 30% of infants over the age of six months are not receiving&#13;
any complementary foods at all. A related problem arises because for traditional reasons the first&#13;
complementary food given may be rice water, which is not sufficiently nutritious and is often not&#13;
taken readily by infants.&#13;
Micronutrient Deficiencies&#13;
8.         Iron Deficiency. Iron-deficiency anemia is a serious problem in most developing&#13;
countries. It leads to impaired capacity for physical work, increased maternal and fetal morbidity&#13;
and mortality and increased risk of low birth weight. It is due mainly to low dietary intake and&#13;
absorption of iron and folate and is exacerbated by the increased needs of pregnancy. Most of the&#13;
iron in Sri Lankan diets is derived from plant sources that contain non-heme (inorganic) iron, which&#13;
is less well absorbed by the body than iron from organic sources. Absorption of non-heme iron is&#13;
decreased by consumption of tea, a standard of the Sri Lankan diet.&#13;
9.          The few available studies indicate that anemia is a major nutritional problem in Sri&#13;
Lanka as well. Two studies conducted by the Medical Research Institute (MRI), involving 129 and&#13;
692 pregnant women, found that 78% and 60% of the women, respectively were anemic, that is, had&#13;
a hemoglobin level of less than I lg/dl. The results of a national iron deficiency survey are expected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

to be available shortly. Iron-folate supplements are given to pregnant mothers attending ante-natal&#13;
clinics, although because of poor compliance due to side effects, the impact of this intervention may&#13;
be limited. Modification of diet may be an alternative approach, since consumption of ascorbic&#13;
acid-rich foods and meat or fish, even in small quantities, can significantly enhance iron absorption.&#13;
10.        Iodine Deficiency Disease (IDD). Iodine is an essential component of hormones&#13;
secreted by the thyroid gland. A wide spectrum of disorders due to iodine deficiency can occur at&#13;
all ages, but it is particularly serious for a pregnant women since iodine deficiency during pregnancy&#13;
can cause stillbirth, congenital abnormalities or cretinism in her child. Goiter, the most common&#13;
manifestation of iodine deficiency, was not documented as a public health problem in Sri Lanka&#13;
until the late 1940s, when the Medical Research Institute reported that it was prevalent in the wet&#13;
zone with areas of high endemicity (more than 10% of the population affected) in Kalutara, Kandy,&#13;
and Matale districts. Subsequently, a survey in 1987 confirmed that iodine deficiency is a public&#13;
health problem throughout the wet zone. Based on the current population of the provinces surveyed,&#13;
over 60% of the Sri Lanka is at risk of iodine deficiency.&#13;
11.        Legislation mandating the iodization of salt was passed in 1993, but only became&#13;
effective in July 1995 in order to give the salt industry and the government time to prepare for its&#13;
implementation. In conjunction with this legislation, UNICEF, the multilateral agency most&#13;
involved to date in strengthening efforts at control of iodine deficiency, has provided iodization&#13;
plants for two saltems and has collaborated with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Industry&#13;
to increase capacity to monitor the iodine content of salt through the provision of laboratory&#13;
equipment and training laboratory staff in various areas of the country. However, the proportion of&#13;
salt fortified with iodine to date is limited, largely due to problems in the salt industry and low&#13;
demand for iodized salt by the public. Low consumer demand for iodized salt is largely because the&#13;
public is unaware of iodine deficiency and its effects, or the efficacy of iodized salt in control of&#13;
IDD. A substantial price differential between iodized and non-iodized salt is also a potential&#13;
constraint to increasing demand for iodized salt.&#13;
12.        Vitamin A Deficiency. Vitamin A is required for normal growth and development of&#13;
the fetus and the infant. The vitamin A status of pregnant and lactating women is crucial, since&#13;
severe vitamin A deficiency during pregnancy may lead to miscarriage or birth defects and to&#13;
vitamin A deficiency in breast feeding infants. During weaning, the child is at risk of developing&#13;
clinical deficiencies if breast milk is replaced with foods low in vitamin A. The prevalence of&#13;
vitamin A deficiency in Sri Lanka is not known. The only national survey, carried out in 1975/76,&#13;
reported the existence of pockets of high prevalence in various parts of the country, the worst&#13;
affected parts being in the districts of Kegale, Matara, and Ratnapura. The results of a national&#13;
vitamin A survey are expected to be available shortly.&#13;
B. The Thriposha Program&#13;
13.        The Thriposha program was initiated in 1973 by the Ministry of Health, with the&#13;
assistance of CARE, to combat the high incidence of child malnutrition, low birth weight, and iron&#13;
deficiency anemia in Sri Lanka. The principal target groups are malnourished children under five&#13;
and pregnant and lactating women. The program is based on provision a take-home dry food&#13;
supplement. Beneficiaries are entitled to a packet of Thriposha once every two weeks, which&#13;
translates into a daily food supplement of 50 grarns. The supplement provides energy, protein, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                                     Annex 5&#13;
Page 4 of 15&#13;
food supplement of 50 grams. The supplement provides energy, protein, and micronutrients as a pre-&#13;
cooked, ready-to-eat, cereal and legume-based food--hence the name "Thriposha" (triple nutrient).&#13;
14.        At the inception of the program, the raw materials were entirely imported, but since then&#13;
the Thriposha formula has undergone considerable modification. Between 1973 and 1990, the bulk of&#13;
the raw materials were supplied by USAID through a PL 480 Title II Grant Agreement. The formula&#13;
currently consists of maize (66%), soybean (30%), full-cream milk powder (3%), and a vitamin-&#13;
mineral premix (2%). The soybean and milk powder are procured locally, while the other components&#13;
are imported. Although maize is grown locally, it cannot be utilized by the program due to high&#13;
levels of aflatoxin. The manufacture of Thriposha is centralized so as to maintain high standards of&#13;
hygiene and quality control.&#13;
15.        The cumulative cost of the program has been $US 39.3 million, at an average of $US 1.9&#13;
million per annum. In recent years, however, actual expenditure has averaged over $US 3.5 million&#13;
per annum. The program is funded, managed and implemented by the Ministry of Health, and the&#13;
bulk of the annual expenditure goes towards production of Thriposha. Up until 1990, CARE played a&#13;
key supporting role in the implementation of the program, and it is generally agreed that overall&#13;
program performance was better prior to that date than it has been since.&#13;
16.        The program currently has about 580,000 'approved' beneficiaries, of which roughly one&#13;
third are pregnant and nursing women and two thirds are children aged 6-59 months. Children are&#13;
considered eligible if their weights, as recorded on growth cards, indicate that they are underweight for&#13;
age, that is, 'below the red line.' Over the years there have been significant fluctuations in the ability&#13;
of the program to supply beneficiaries on a regular basis. in 1994 and 1995, the production of&#13;
Thriposha declined sharply due to difficulty in securing raw materials.&#13;
17.        A number of issues have been raised conceming the program's impact and sustainability,&#13;
including the following.&#13;
(a)   sharing--the supplement may be consumed by the entire family rather than the target&#13;
beneficiary;&#13;
(b)   substitution--when the supplement is given for the under-five child, the mother may&#13;
reduce the child's regular food, resulting in no increase in nutrient intake;&#13;
(c)   distortion of growth monitoring--since Thriposha eligibility is linked to recording of the&#13;
child as underweight on the growth card, weights may not be recorded accurately;&#13;
(d)   dependency--the free distribution of the food may reinforce a dependent attitude on the&#13;
part of the recipient;&#13;
(e)   sustainability--the production of Thriposha is dependent on imported commodities and is&#13;
quite expensive.&#13;
18.  There is no consistent evidence that the Thriposha program has been effective in improving the&#13;
nutritional status of beneficiaries. Therefore, the Ministry of Health will carry out an evaluation of the&#13;
program by June 30, 1998 and will then implement recommendations agreed with IDA (para. 24).&#13;

C. The Nutrition Component of the National Development Trust Fund Project&#13;
19.  A number of community-based nutrition and integrated rural development programs with&#13;
nutrition components are currently supported by UNICEF, UNDP, several bilateral donors, and NGOs&#13;
such as Sarvodaya. The most extensive of these is the nutrition component of the IDA-supported&#13;
Poverty alleviation (National Development Trust Fund--formerly the Janasaviya Trust Fund) Project.&#13;
The objective of the NDTF nutrition component is to reduce levels of malnutrition among young&#13;
children and the incidence of low birth weight, with emphasis on reaching the poorest and most&#13;
deprived populations. An 'In-Depth Approach' is being implemented in 180 of Sri Lanka's 256&#13;
administrative divisions, covering about 10% of the total population. Nutrition activities are&#13;
implemented by NGOs, known as Partner Organizations (POs), in one village cluster (Grama Niladari&#13;
Division--GND) per division. Ten of the most deprived village clusters are selected in each division.&#13;
20.        The In-Depth team at the division level consists of four persons: a project coordinator,&#13;
nutrition field worker (NFW), accounts clerk, and field assistant. These workers are trained by the&#13;
NDTF with the NFW receiving 3 weeks training in nutrition and related fields, while the others have a&#13;
3-day orientation. Each village cluster also has 7 volunteers, three in basic nutrition (trained for 3&#13;
days), and four "scholars" who receive training in their particular specialty--agriculture/animal&#13;
husbandry (13 days' training), health/sanitation (10 days), preschool teacher (30 days) and child&#13;
care/family planning (10 days).&#13;
21.        The In-Depth approach is implemented in stages:&#13;
(a)   Volunteer Nutrition Workers (VNWs) trained -- 3 per GND&#13;
(b)  All children weighed&#13;
(c)   Train VNWs in survey methodology&#13;
Conduct household poverty survey&#13;
(d)   Meeting with GND elders (if required)&#13;
Meeting with the 35 most deprived households to discuss problems and identify/develop&#13;
proposals&#13;
Finalize community development proposals&#13;
(e)  Implement community action proposals&#13;
While all under-five children and pregnant/lactating mothers are included in the program, "special&#13;
care" is provided to those identified as the poorest in the community survey. The same group&#13;
develops the community work proposals which address the immediate causes of malnutrition in that&#13;
village.&#13;
22.        In general, implementation of the nutrition component of the project has gone well. POs&#13;
had been selected and project-supported activities were underway in by POs in all 180 targeted&#13;
divisions by 1955. There have been problems conceming monitoring and reporting of project output&#13;
and impact indicators. Initial indications are that the component is achieving improvements in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                                     Annex 5&#13;
Page 6 of 15&#13;
nutritional levels of children, although rigorous demonstration of impact is not yet possible. Project&#13;
impact on low birth weight has not been tracked.&#13;
23.        The component originally included Thriposha, but due to recent unavailability combined&#13;
with questionable sustainability, Thriposha has now been eliminated from the project design. Instead,&#13;
the project will support production of a local, low-technology food supplement as an income-&#13;
generating activity. However, it is important to note that the results that have been achieved thus far&#13;
have been accomplished without any food supplementation.&#13;
D. Nutrition Component of the Project&#13;
24.        The Nutrition component of the Health Services Project will support the programs of the&#13;
Ministry of Health to improve the nutritional status of the most vulnerable groups in the population:&#13;
infants, young children and pregnant women. These programs will utilize primarily the existing&#13;
resources available in the Ministry of Health. The focus will be on reorientation and revitalization of&#13;
the existing growth promotion program of the Ministry's Family Health Bureau (i.e. the MCH unit&#13;
under the Director MCH). Since there is no consistent evidence that the Thriposha program has been&#13;
effective in improving the nutritional status of beneficiaries, MOH will carry out an impact evaluation&#13;
of the program by June 30, 1998, will discuss the findings with IDA, and will then implement agreed&#13;
recommendations. This section of the annex provides details about most aspects of the nutrition&#13;
component, which is summarized in the main text of the Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
25.        To provide an organizational focus for nutrition programs and activities in the Ministry&#13;
of Health and to strengthen the ability of the Family Health Bureau and the health system to plan,&#13;
manage and implement a national growth promotion program, the project will support the following:&#13;
26.        Ministry of Health. Administrative and other logistical support will be provided to the&#13;
Family Health Bureau, which is the focal point for nutrition activities within the Ministry. A nutrition&#13;
unit will be set up as part of the FHB, and a post of Deputy Director MCH (Nutrition) will be&#13;
established to specifically be responsible for nutrition activities. A clerk and a statistical assistant with&#13;
computer training will be appointed to assist the Deputy Director, and office equipment and supplies&#13;
will be supported. Two national consultants will also be engaged for the duration of the project to&#13;
assist with project implementation. Two vehicles, for the Deputy Director and for the consultants, will&#13;
be provided.&#13;
27.        The Medical Research Institute (MRI) is the technical arm of the Ministry of Health. To&#13;
enable the Nutrition Division of the Medical Research Institute to take the leading role in the&#13;
implementation and coordination of survey and operational research work for the project, the project&#13;
will support strengthening of the Division. Data processing capability will be strengthened through&#13;
provision of computer facilities and office equipment. In addition, the field capacity of the Division&#13;
will be strengthened through the provision of a vehicle.&#13;
28.        Divisional Health &amp; Nutrition Committees. In order to coordinate, promote and&#13;
strengthen health and nutrition activities at divisional level, Divisional Health and Nutrition&#13;
Committees will be established if they do not already exist. Members of these committees include the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 7 of 15&#13;
divisional Secretary, the Divisional director of Health Services (DDHS), the Divisional director of&#13;
Education, the Agricultural Extension Officer, the Assistant Director of Planning, and representatives&#13;
of NGOs working in the division. Other relevant individuals are invited to join as appropriate. The&#13;
functioning of these committees has been uneven, but it is clear that they can make a major&#13;
contribution if they are adequately motivated, supported and mobilized. The project will provide&#13;
operational support for committee meetings and activities and will monitor their progress. Minutes of&#13;
committee meetings will be forwarded to the FHB. One of the consultants' major responsibilities will&#13;
be to coordinate with the Committees and promote their support for project activities.&#13;
Nutrition Working Group&#13;
29.        A Nutrition Working Group in the Ministry of Health, chaired by the Director MCH and&#13;
including the Deputy Director MCH (Nutrition) and representatives of the Health Education Bureau&#13;
and the Medical Research Institute, will be constituted to provide policy and implementation guidance&#13;
for the Nutrition component. The Director MCH will invite the participation of others working in the&#13;
nutrition field from within government, academic institutions and other organizations as appropriate.&#13;
The Working Group will meet at least once a quarter to review the progress of the component.&#13;
Program and Project Orientation&#13;
30.        Orientation to the Health Ministry's nutrition programs and to the project will be&#13;
provided for all Health staff concerned with nutrition programs. There will be a one-day workshop for&#13;
senior staff in the first year of the project. This will include the Health Secretary, the Director&#13;
General Health Services, the Deputy Director General Public Health Services, the Director, National&#13;
Institute of Health Services, the provincial Health Secretaries, the provincial Directors of Health&#13;
Services, and the provincial Deputy Directors of Health Services. There will be additional orientation&#13;
workshops for district and divisional level staff including the members of divisional Health &amp;&#13;
Nutrition Committees. The orientation will cover current nutrition problems in Sri Lanka, the&#13;
strategies being adopted to address these problems, especially the reorientation of the growth&#13;
promotion program and the key nutrition messages to be conveyed, the roles of the various&#13;
government departments concerned, and coordination with other nutrition programs.&#13;
National Growth Promotion Program&#13;
31.        Growth promotion can be defined as activities that promote either normal growth of a&#13;
normal child or catch-up growth of a malnourished child, including low birth weight infants. Growth&#13;
monitoring refers to the measurement and recording of a child's weight on the card provided to&#13;
mothers by the FHB for the purpose. Growth monitoring should be seen as one aspect of growth&#13;
promotion that serves as an entry point for other aspects of growth promotion, particularly nutrition&#13;
education. It must be delinked, in the minds of health workers and the general public, from its present&#13;
close association with thriposha eligibility. Growth promotion, rather than detection of malnutrition,&#13;
should be understood by all concerned as the basic purpose of growth monitoring.&#13;
32.        The public health midwife (PHM) is responsible for growth promotion activities.&#13;
However, given her many other tasks, one of the goals of the re-oriented growth promotion program&#13;
will be to make growth promotion a community-based program and to utilize NGO workers and/or&#13;
community volunteers to carry out growth promotion activities to the extent possible. The PHM,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 8 of 15&#13;
together with NGO workers and/or community volunteers, will be responsible for the following&#13;
activities involving pregnant women, the mothers of infants and young children and their children,&#13;
and the community, as follows.&#13;
Pregnant Women&#13;
Provide general pregnancy counseling, including diet and weight gain advice&#13;
Provide iron-folate supplementation and motivate to consume&#13;
Monitor weight gain&#13;
Motivate to give colostrum to newborn&#13;
Infants/Mothers&#13;
Motivate to breast feed exclusively for 4-6 months&#13;
Provide general lactation counseling&#13;
Counsel about importance of steady growth in infant and role of growth monitoring&#13;
Monitor growth of infant&#13;
Ensure referral if initial faltering of growth continues&#13;
Provide iron-folate supplementation for at least six weeks postpartum and motivate to&#13;
consume&#13;
Counsel about treatment of diarrhea&#13;
Counsel about benefits of iodized salt&#13;
Young Children/Mothers&#13;
Counsel about important of steady growth of child&#13;
Counsel about start of weaning at 4-6 months, appropriate weaning foods and feeding&#13;
frequency&#13;
Demonstrate preparation of simple local weaning foods&#13;
Monitor growth of young child&#13;
Ensure referral if initial faltering of growth continues&#13;
Counsel about spacing and family planning as appropriate&#13;
Counsel about treatment of diarrhea&#13;
Counsel about benefits of iodized salt&#13;
Community&#13;
Promote community awareness of importance of good matemal, infant, and young child&#13;
nutrition&#13;
33.        Introduction of the reoriented growth promotion program will follow completion of in-&#13;
service training of PHMs and supervisors, which will be phased over the first three years of the&#13;
project. In those areas where the NDTF nutrition component or other community-based programs&#13;
that include nutrition activities are being implemented, the emphasis will be on coordination&#13;
between the PHM and NGO workers and/or volunteers who are already active. In those areas&#13;
where there is only the FHB program, after completing her nutrition training, the PHM, with the&#13;
assistance of local leaders, local NGOs, her supervisor, the DDHS and the Divisional Health &amp;&#13;
Nutrition Committee will organize a local Health &amp; Nutrition Committee if one does not already&#13;
exist. She will discuss with local leaders, local NGOs, and the local Committee the importance of&#13;
growth promotion and will seek their assistance in recruiting local volunteers (most probably&#13;
married women). The DDHS will be responsible for providing training to volunteers. The PHM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -                                  Annex 5&#13;
Page 9 of 15&#13;
will also seek the agreement of local leaders concerning a location (or locations) for establishment&#13;
of a community nutrition center as a focus for growth promotion activities in her area. Growth&#13;
monitoring and nutrition counseling will be carried out at the community nutrition centers,&#13;
separately from MCH clinics, on a fixed day at a specified time each month. The volunteers will be&#13;
instrumental in ensuring that children are brought for weighing, and to the extent possible they will&#13;
carry out growth monitoring and counseling under the supervision of the PHM. They will also&#13;
make household visits to pregnant women and mothers with infants and young children.&#13;
Communications Strategy&#13;
34.        The communications strategy for the growth promotion program will include both&#13;
interpersonal communications and mass media campaigns. It will be coordinated by the Health&#13;
Education Bureau (HEB) of the Ministry of Health and to the extent possible will draw on nutrition&#13;
communications development already accomplished, particularly by UNICEF with the support of the&#13;
IDA-assisted Health &amp; Family Planning project and by the nutrition component of the IDA-assisted&#13;
Poverty Alleviation project. Interpersonal communication by PHMs and volunteers to convey key&#13;
messages concerning pregnancy, breast feeding, weaning and micronutrients and associated nutrition&#13;
counseling drawing on the information supplied by growth monitoring will be the core of the growth&#13;
promotion effort. The communications strategy will encompass message development, pretesting,&#13;
development and testing of materials and media, and modifications of messages, materials and&#13;
media based on experience as the project progresses. It will be important that the key messages are&#13;
understood at all levels of the program. Mass media campaiRns will provide an essential&#13;
complement to the interpersonal communication efforts. The messages featured will also focus on&#13;
pregnancy, breast feeding, weaning and micronutrients. HEB will ensure that health staff are&#13;
informed about the media to be utilized and content of upcoming campaigns, so that they can be&#13;
used to reinforce and validate local interpersonal efforts. Coordination to ensure that the various&#13;
nutrition programs convey consistent messages is the responsibility of the national Nutrition Steering&#13;
Committee, which will request the Nutrition Working Group to convene workshops for the purpose&#13;
as needed.&#13;
Role of NGOs&#13;
35.        NGOs would be involved in the growth promotion program, directly and indirectly, in&#13;
the following ways:&#13;
(a)   Reorientation of the growth promotion program and associated in-service training of&#13;
health staff as well as training of community volunteers would draw to the extent&#13;
possible on the experience and materials of the NDTF in-depth nutrition component,&#13;
which is implemented by NGOs under contract to the Tmst Fund.&#13;
(b)  In those areas where community-based nutrition programs are already being&#13;
implemented, e.g. the areas covered by the NDTF nutrition component, the reoriented&#13;
MOH growth promotion program would coordinate and cooperate with ongoing&#13;
activities rather than trying to replace them or compete with them; thus, in such NDTF&#13;
areas the program is already being implemented by NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82 -Annex 5&#13;
Page 10 of 15&#13;
(c)  In other areas, the resources and experience of existing NGOs will be utilized to the&#13;
extent possible to identify community volunteers, and their cooperation would be&#13;
solicited in setting up community nutrition centers and community-based nutrition&#13;
education efforts.&#13;
Rapid Assessment of Growth Monitoring Activities&#13;
36.        Prior to undertaking in-service training for FHB staff, a rapid assessment of how&#13;
growth monitoring activities are currently carried out will be undertaken. The exercise will be&#13;
coordinated by one of the long-term consultants for the nutrition component, who will report on the&#13;
results of the exercise. The sample of sites to be visited will include areas where the In-Depth&#13;
program of the National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) is operating, where other nutrition&#13;
programs are ongoing, and where only the current FHB program is being carried out.&#13;
37.        The assessment will elicit through observation and discussion with health workers,&#13;
volunteers, mothers, etc. knowledge and practice in respect of:&#13;
(a)   General principles of growth monitoring. For example, are mothers and workers aware&#13;
that the growth chart allows for comparison of a child's growth with that of a reference&#13;
population; that as long as the child's weight gain is parallel to the reference line the&#13;
child is gaining weight at the appropriate rate and is not in need of immediate&#13;
intervention; that a growth curve that is flat or decreasing is a waming signal; that it is&#13;
also a diagnostic tool to identify the undemourished or those needing&#13;
nutritional/medical intervention.&#13;
(b)   Carrving out of growth monitoring. Is the weighing being done reliably and&#13;
accurately; what type of scale is being used; condition of the scale--is it zeroed&#13;
routinely and checked periodically against standard weights; are weighing&#13;
pants/trousers in good condition; is the child handled properly during the weighing; is&#13;
the child's age verified; is the weight read, recorded and plotted on the chart correctly;&#13;
is the information on the chart being interpreted correctly by the health worker, the&#13;
mother, and others involved and related to other health information; is the chart used to&#13;
primarily identify beneficiaries for thriposha: is the information appropriately used for&#13;
weaning advice; are weights for a given child being recording regularly. The&#13;
assessment should also try to ascertain what percentage of children in the area covered&#13;
are being weighted.&#13;
Development of a Nutrition Guide for Health Workers&#13;
38.        Also prior to the program of in-service training, a Nutrition Guide for training and&#13;
reference purposes will be developed. The Guide should be concise and limited to important&#13;
information and practical instruction. The Nutrition Working Group will appoint a nutrition&#13;
curricula working group to compile the Guide that will include content specialists from the MRI,&#13;
FHB, HEB and NIHS, and outside experts, e.g. a sociologist and a home science expert, who will&#13;
seek the collaboration with the College of Obstetricians and the College of Pediatricians. The&#13;
findings of the rapid assessment of growth monitoring would also be used in the preparation of this&#13;
document. After the text is reviewed and finalized, it will be translated into Sinhala and Tamil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83-                                    Annex 5&#13;
Page 11 of 15&#13;
The Health Education Bureau will be consulted on design and printing. Initial requirements are&#13;
anticipated to be 2,500 copies in English, 15,000 in Sinhala and 3,500 in Tamil. Development and&#13;
production of the Guide should be completed in 3-4 months.&#13;
39.        The nutrition needs and problems of the following groups should be covered by the&#13;
Guide.&#13;
(a)   Adolescents and Young Women&#13;
The special concerns and requirements of non-pregnant adolescents and young women.&#13;
(b)   Pregnant and Lactating Women&#13;
General principles of health and nutrition during pregnancy, including energy&#13;
requirements, relevant to pregnancy and lactation. (The special concerns of non-&#13;
pregnant adolescents and young women should also need to be included.)&#13;
Issues relating to weight gain in pregnancy. Use of the weight gain chart and&#13;
relevance of regular weight measurement during pregnancy and its interpretation.&#13;
Dietary advice and instruction with specific reference to locally available nutritious&#13;
food. (Examples of nutritious diets during pregnancy will assist the health staff to&#13;
confidently advise mothers.)&#13;
Prevention and control of anemia in pregnanCv. A comprehensive strategy has already&#13;
been formulated at a National Consultation on the Prevention and Control of Anaemia&#13;
in Pregnancy. The sections on dietary modification, iron folate supplementation, and&#13;
screening for anemia in pregnancy, as well as guidelines for referral of problem cases,&#13;
should be included. The issues related to poor compliance with iron-folate supplements&#13;
should be highlighted and stress given to ways and means to deal with this problem.&#13;
(c)  Infants and Young Children&#13;
General principles of growth and development in infants, young children (1-3 years)&#13;
and preschool children (3-5 years).&#13;
Breast feeding: importance of early initiation of breast feeding, feeding of colostrum,&#13;
exclusive breast feeding through first 4-6 months; common problems and how to deal&#13;
with them.&#13;
Weaning: appropriate timing of weaning; appropriate weaning foods that can be&#13;
prepared inexpensively in the household; feeding requirements of infants and young&#13;
children; common infant feeding problems and how to deal with them.&#13;
Nutrition reguirements of different are groups: use of nutritious foods available locally;&#13;
recommended daily dietary schedules for different age groups, with quantities, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Development of Curricula for In-Service Training&#13;
40.         As an extension of the development of the Nutrition Guide, the nutrition curricula&#13;
working group will oversee the development of curricula for the in-service training of health staff.&#13;
Curricula would need to be developed for the following categories of staff to be trained.&#13;
(a)   Public health (MCH) staff viz. PHNs, SPHIMs, PHMs. The Health Education Officers&#13;
(HEOs) would also be included in this category. Duration of training: four days. This&#13;
is the crucial category of health worker that would really take growth promotion&#13;
activities into the community.&#13;
(b)   Public Health Inspeectors (PHIs). As a member of the public health team, this category&#13;
will be given an orientation with regard to growth promotion activities that are&#13;
proposed and their role in supporting such efforts. Duration of training: one day.&#13;
(c)   Nursing/midwifery staff attached to matemity and pediatric wards of hospitals. The&#13;
training would concentrate on particularly relevant areas such as maternal nutrition,&#13;
exclusive breast feeding, principles of infant and young child nutrition, and appropriate&#13;
weaning practices, which would help to enlist the support of hospital staff for growth&#13;
promotion activities. Duration of training: one day.&#13;
(d)   Estate health staff, including medical assistants (RMPs, AMPs, EMAs) and midwives.&#13;
The curricula for training would be similar to that for MCH staff.&#13;
41.        In addition to technical curricula, curricula for training in interpersonal communication,&#13;
to be carried out primarily by staff of the Health Education Bureau, will be developed. As a part of&#13;
this task, the training methods, materials and experience already being used by the NDTF nutrition&#13;
component and other nutrition programs will be reviewed and utilized to the extent possible.&#13;
Training of Trainers (TOT)&#13;
42.         Once curricula are finalized, training of trainers (TOT) will be undertaken. The first&#13;
three categories above will be trained by district training teams comprising five selected trainers&#13;
from each district, which will be trained centrally for six days. TOT will be undertaken in three&#13;
phases, spread out over the first three years of the project. For estate health staff, core trainers will&#13;
be selected and trained from within the estates. On the last day of the training course, the&#13;
respective Deputy Provincial Directors would be invited as resource persons to assist in the planning&#13;
process for implementation of training in their respective regions. Duration of TOT: six days.&#13;
Numbers and phasing are indicated in the following table.&#13;

43.        A total of 110 core-trainers will be trained in the seven estate regions, namely: Galle&#13;
20, Ratnapura 14, Badulla 16, Kegalle 16, Kandy 12, Hatton 12 and Nuwara Eliya 20. Ratnapura&#13;
14, Badulla 16, Kegalle 16, Kandy 12, Hatton 12 and Nuwara Eliya 20. The total number of health&#13;
staff involved in the training would be approximately 630. Duration of training four days.&#13;
In-Service Training of Staff&#13;
a.      Public health field staff (MCH staff and PHIs). Number to be trained is based on the&#13;
assumption that each Divisional Directorate of Health Services (DDHS) area has on&#13;
average 20 FHB staff (PHNs, SPHMs and PHMs) and eight PHI's; 254 DDHS areas&#13;
are assumed. Duration of training: four days for FHB staff and one day for PHIs.&#13;
Numbers to be trained and phasing are indicated in the following table.&#13;

b.     Institutional staff. Ten institutional training programs will be undertaken per district, in&#13;
selected institutions. Fifteen nurses and midwives attached to obstetric and pediatric&#13;
wards will participate in each training program. This training will be undertaken by&#13;
the respective DDHSs, supported by the Regional MO (MCH) and other resource&#13;
persons as appropriate, up to a maximum of four persons. Duration of training: one&#13;
day. Numbers to be trained and phasing are indicated in the following table.&#13;

c.      Estate health staff. Training of estate health staff comprising medical assistants&#13;
(Registered and Assistant Medical Practitioners and Estate Medical Assistants), Junior&#13;
Medical Assistants, and midwives will be undertaken. The seven estate sector regions&#13;
will have teams of core trainers to undertake the training of other staff. A category of&#13;
community mobilizer on the estates, called the plantation family welfare supervisor&#13;
(PFWS), as well as creche attendants will also be trained for two days using a modified&#13;
curriculum. The numbers to be trained will be approximately 380 PFWSs and 1,510&#13;
creche attendants. The training of estate staff would be coordinated by the Health and&#13;
Women's Division of the Plantation Housing and Social Welfare Trust, which is the&#13;
central organization involved in health and welfare activities on estates.&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
44.        One of the initial activities to be undertaken will be finalization of a monitoring&#13;
scheme for the growth promotion program, so that it can be incorporated into the in-service training&#13;
of health workers. A routine monthly reporting system for growth monitoring that gives the&#13;
percentage of underweight children at a given point in time and the percentage whose growth is&#13;
faltering, as well as infonnation on household visiting and other growth promotion activities&#13;
undertaken, needs to be developed.&#13;
45.        While the overall impact of the component will be evaluated through national surveys&#13;
of nutritional status, a special effort will be made to monitor the ongoing progress and impact of the&#13;
growth promotion program. However, reporting of growth monitoring is open to the objection that&#13;
it is always incomplete, that is, it is not certain that those children weighed one month are the same&#13;
as those weighed the previous month, or even that those linked over two months are again picked up&#13;
the following month. This will be dealt with through the designation of at least one division in each&#13;
province as a sentinel division. Several of the sentinel divisions should be NDTF divisions. It will&#13;
be necessary, first, to carry out baseline surveys in selected divisions. Special efforts will then be&#13;
made in the sentinel divisions to achieve high reporting rates. The functioning of the sentinel&#13;
monitoring scheme will be carefully observed in the first phase of implementation and adjustments&#13;
made as experience indicates. Baseline surveys will also be carried out in matched divisions, where&#13;
the program will not be introduced until the last phase, for control purposes.&#13;
&#13;

46.         Basic training for public health staff is undertaken at the National Institute of Health&#13;
Sciences (NIHS) Kalutara and at 9 other Public Health Training Centers. The NIHS takes the lead&#13;
role in the preparation of curricula for basic training of public health staff and will be closely&#13;
associated with the development of curricula for in-service training under the nutrition component of&#13;
the project. Therefore, the content developed for in-service training will also be incorporated into the&#13;
basic (pre-service) training curricula for all categories of public health staff. The project will support&#13;
a meeting of public health trainers from the training institutes to effect the necessary changes.&#13;
47.         Of the 9 Public Health Training Centers, 4 (at Galle, Kadugannawa, Kurunegala and&#13;
Tellipalai) have been upgraded to Regional Training Centers (RTCs) and will in addition take on the&#13;
training of other categories of paramedical workers, for which adequate support has been provided&#13;
under ADB project assistance. The other 5 training centers (at Panadura, Homagama, Moratuwa,&#13;
Werallagama and Batticaloa) are in urgent need of support for IEC and office equipment, which will&#13;
be provided under the project. Provision will also be made to upgrade the library facilities at these&#13;
training institutions.&#13;
Operational Research&#13;
48.         Operational research will be the responsibility of the Nutrition Division of the Medical&#13;
Research Institute (MRI) of the Ministry of Health. The Nutrition Division will develop a list of&#13;
research proposals which will be reviewed by the Nutrition Working Group. Additionally, the&#13;
Nutrition Division will establish a screening and technical review process and will invite proposals&#13;
from outside the Ministry of Health. Proposals could be submitted by individuals, academic or other&#13;
research organizations, NGOs, etc.&#13;
49.         A number of proposals for operational research have already been identified, including&#13;
the following.&#13;
On estates, most of the growth monitoring activities are conducted in creches. It is&#13;
proposed that a pilot program be undertaken involving 10-20 estate creches, where&#13;
intensive follow-up with parents of children whose growth is faltering would be&#13;
undertaken by creche and plantation health staff.&#13;
In Kurunegala district, an experimental scheme has been introduced to use measurement&#13;
of their height and weight by students as a method of helping to sensitive them to&#13;
nutritional issues affecting their growth and development. It is proposed that this scheme&#13;
be evaluated and, if warranted, expanded to areas.&#13;
It is proposed to evaluate the use of school health cards to improve nutritional status of&#13;
students.&#13;

HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Health Policy Component: Proposed Link Program Between the&#13;
Health Economics Study Program. University of Colombo and the Ministry of Health&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.         Health policy development, through research into issues central to the provision and&#13;
financing of health care services and the sensitizing of decision makers, has become an urgent&#13;
necessity with the tightening of resource constraints that require prioritization and the introduction of&#13;
altemative strategies.&#13;
2.         Health economics has grown in stature as a subject of policy importance and relevance.&#13;
It is an essential tool in the management of limited health care resources to satisfy social objectives,&#13;
particularly with regard to the provision of adequate health care for the needy and disadvantaged. A&#13;
knowledge of health economics is also extremely valuable to sensitize health sector decision makers, at&#13;
both the micro and macro levels, on the complex issues that arise in decision making with regard to&#13;
efficiency, equity and sustainability in the face of necessary trade-offs and externalities. Further, it&#13;
can have considerable power to create awareness among officials in other ministries, members of NGO&#13;
bodies and the general public regarding health issues, altemative funding sources and service provision&#13;
facilities, and their role in contributing to the development of health care services in the country.&#13;
3.         The proposed link between the Health Economics Study Program (HESP) and the&#13;
Ministry of Health can play an important role in such a context by facilitating research and providing&#13;
training programs that inform and educate a range of personnel, from parliamentarians and policy&#13;
makers through medical administrators and medical students to grassroot level health workers.&#13;
4.         HESP, which has been chosen as the link organization, is headed by a Health Economist&#13;
trained at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He will be supported by other staff&#13;
members who are currently actively engaged in research and training activities on health related&#13;
economic issues. The members of HESP are:&#13;
a. Dr. Nimal Attanayake (Ph.D. London)   Sr. Lecturer in Economics/Heal of HESP&#13;
b. Dr. Harsha Aturupane (Ph.D. Cambridge)  Sr. Lecturer in Economics&#13;
c. Dr. Amala de Silva (D.Phil. Sussex)   Sr. Lecturer in Economics&#13;
d. Mr. Sarath Vidanagama (M.Sc. Stirling)   Sr. Lecturer in Eco., Head, Dept. of Eco.&#13;
5.         Health Economics is already being taught as part of the B.A. Economics Honors Degree&#13;
at the Department of Economics, University of Colombo. Members of HESP are conducting the&#13;
Health Economics course in the M.Sc. program in Health Administration. A workshop on Matemal&#13;
and Child Health Care, for senior officials of the health and finance ministries, was organized under&#13;
the auspices of UNICEF and the Ministry of Health in February 1995. A session on economic&#13;
evaluation was also conducted in a workshop on Health and Financing Issues conducted under the&#13;
IDA/World Bank sector project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 6&#13;
6.         Research on health sector issues have been conducted primarily by Dr. Attanayake,&#13;
starting with a study of health sector resource flows in Gampaha district conducted for the Ministry of&#13;
Health with WHO funding in 1987, followed by one of the earliest HSR studies on resource utilization&#13;
at medical institutions in the same district and later policy related research funded by WHO/TDR.&#13;
Other areas of current research by members of HESP include health sector financing, malaria. PHC,&#13;
hospital autonomy, public-private mix, AIDS and addiction.&#13;
7.         Dr. Attanayake has been a long-standing member of the HSR committee. Members of&#13;
the Study Program have attended HSR seminars, as well as other recent seminars on issues such as&#13;
malaria, public-private mix, health sector financing, AIDS and medical ethics. Members of HESP&#13;
have also attended inter-country consultative meetings on behalf of the Ministry of Health. Such&#13;
activities have fostered a close link between the members of HESP and the Ministry of Health. These&#13;
links are likely to prove helpful in future collaboration.&#13;
Objectives of the Program&#13;
8.         The Program envisages the achievement of the following objectives.&#13;
(a)   Creating an appreciation for Health Economics, and awareness of financing issues among&#13;
senior policy and decision makers;&#13;
(b)   Enhancing the skills for Health Economics, particularly cost and financial analysis,&#13;
among operating level managers;&#13;
(c)   Sensitizing service providers to cost and financing issues;&#13;
(d)   Developing institutional capacity in the field of Health Economics;&#13;
(e)   Carrying out research programs in the area of health policy development on issues jointly&#13;
agreed between the Ministry of Health and HESP.&#13;
9.         In order to achieve these objectives the following strategy will be pursued:&#13;
(a)   The Health Economics Study Program and the Ministry of Health will enter into a long-&#13;
term agreement in order to establish an efficient and firm foundation for their&#13;
collaboration.&#13;
(b)   The capacity of the HESP will be developed through the provision of fellowships and&#13;
training opportunities.&#13;
(c)   A close organizational relationship will be maintained through interactions between the&#13;
Deputy Director General (Planning) in the Ministry of Health and the Head of HESP.&#13;
10.        The plans with regard to the programn will be made by two representatives of the&#13;
Ministry of Health and HESP. A meeting of these representatives will be held at least once every&#13;
quarter. Three policy advisors will be appointed to advice on this program. A three-week review of&#13;
the program will be conducted by a local consultant at the end of each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 6&#13;
l.         Institutional capacity building will involve the provision of one two-year M.Sc./M.Phil&#13;
fellowship or two one-year M.Sc. fellowships. Four short-term fellowships are also envisaged.&#13;
Equipment, hardware, software and supplies will be provided for the maintenance of this link program.&#13;
Envisared Activities&#13;
Training and Dissemination&#13;
-          Training programs to be conducted for provincial, district and divisional health staff with&#13;
the objective of providing planning, management and evaluation;&#13;
-          Workshops to be conducted for groups such as medical consultants, matrons, politicians&#13;
and hospital development committee members with the objective of sensitizing them to&#13;
issues related to provision of health services;&#13;
-          Other training and workshops as appropriate.&#13;
12.        In addition to conducting such training programs for the benefit of the participants, the&#13;
material prepared and the resource persons trained will be of great benefit in the future. Studies will&#13;
be undertaken with a view to creating course material and case studies to be used in these&#13;
dissemination and training programs. The findings of such studies will be disseminated through&#13;
workshops and briefing of Ministry of Health officials.&#13;
Curriculum Preparation&#13;
A curriculum will be prepared in conjunction with the Department of Community&#13;
Medicine, to be used in undergraduate teaching at the Medical Faculty of the University&#13;
of Colombo.&#13;
Research&#13;
Research will be undertaken in the following areas in the first two years of this program.&#13;
First Year - Research will involve evaluating policy options for strengthening the&#13;
financial capability of the tertiary sector - this will involve in-depth analyses of such&#13;
schemes as paybeds, autonomous hospitals with subsidies, user fees for specific services,&#13;
cooperative systems within hospitals and other options.&#13;
Research programs for the subsequent years will be developed in collaboration with the&#13;
Ministry of Health, taking into account the changing health sector environment and the&#13;
needs of the Ministry. Postgraduate students and ministry officials could be involved in&#13;
these research activities on the request of the Ministry of Health. Tentatively, for the&#13;
second year, a research study is planned on the area of public-private mix in health&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 91 -                                    Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
Research findings will be disseminated through reports prepared for the Ministry of&#13;
Health and seminars conducted for policy makers since the research issues chosen reflect&#13;
important current policy concerns.&#13;
An annual workshop will also be organized to disseminate research findings to an&#13;
audience of important policy and decision makers.&#13;
Other Support&#13;
HESP will undertake to build and maintain databases in costs and health sector behavior&#13;
that can support policy-related decision making.&#13;
A newsletter will be prepared and circulated (bi-annually in the first year of the program&#13;
and quarterly thereafter) among health sector policy makers and administrators, and&#13;
others involved in decision making on the financing and provision of health care services&#13;
at a central and provincial level. The newsletter will include reports on the ongoing&#13;
activities of the link program, including summarized reports of research findings as well&#13;
as news of activities organized by the Ministry of Health and other organizations in the&#13;
field of Health Economics.&#13;
HESP will also provide advisory support to the Ministry of Health in the form of an&#13;
average of seven-person days per month on an agreed time schedule.&#13;

Dear Mr. Vice President,&#13;
LETT-ER OF HEALTH DEVELOPMENT POLICY&#13;
I am writng to you in connection with the proposed Sri Lanka Health Services Project to inform&#13;
you officially about policy measures that the Govemment has recently taken, or is about to take,&#13;
to reach Sri Lanka's objectves for the furither development of the health sector.&#13;
As you aware, Sri Lanka has a long and worthy tradition of an effective health policy and system&#13;
which has resulted in the country now enjoying health indicators which are among the best in the&#13;
world for a country at our level of overall development. This is a remarkable achievement and one&#13;
of which the country is rightly proud. However, the Government is not complacent about the&#13;
situation and is actively pursumag a number of policies and strategies on a wide front which are&#13;
designed to improve the health status of the populaion even further, and to do it an efficient and&#13;
cost - effective manner using the strengths of both the public and prvate sectors to the fullest.&#13;
The Health Policy document prepared in 1992 is now being revised by the Health&#13;
Advisory   Committee appointed by  the Ministry.  In addition,  the Ministry  has&#13;
directed the Health Advisory Committee to look into the ten year perspective plan&#13;
prepared by the Management Development and planning Unit and to recommend&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
- 95 -                           Attachment&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
priority areas for implementation. The National Advisory Committee will now look at both these documents&#13;
and in keeping with the new Government policy, i.e. Peoples Alliance's policy, they will re-submit a revised&#13;
Health Policy Statement for the present Government within the next three months and also a developmental&#13;
activity design. The preliminary indications from this body are that the policy stated and the plans submitted&#13;
are in keeping with the present policy of the Government, but needs a little refining and strengthening in the&#13;
areas for where the present Government has pledged special emphasis.&#13;
Key aspects of the health policy include emphasis on health promotion and prevention of both communicable&#13;
and non-communicable diseases; fostering healthy life styles; human resource development in both the public&#13;
and private sectors; improving service quality; and decentralisation. Important strategies to be followed within&#13;
this framework include priority for Improving equity through concentrating on underprivileged and under-served&#13;
groups; making better use of exisdng resources through improved efficiency and greater accountability;&#13;
strengthening community participation in services; managerial and associated information systems development;&#13;
and the promotion of the private sector in service delivery, especially the commercial sector, and NGO&#13;
involvement generally.&#13;
As is well known, Sri Lanka has largely passed through the epidemiological transition. The pattern of disease&#13;
which we now face is of a radically different nature to that faced only twenty or thirty years ago. While we will&#13;
continue to be on our guard against the traditional enemies of infectious and communicable diseases and while&#13;
we will continue to ensure that they are reduced to a low level, we are seeking to make the substantial&#13;
adjustment - through this new policy - towards more seriously addressing non-communicable diseases. This&#13;
adjustment will take time, but we recognise that these diseases now account for over half of our total disease&#13;
incidence and therefore merit significantly higher priority than they were previously given.&#13;
In this respect priority is now given to address the problem of non-communicable diseases. An Advisory&#13;
Committee under the Chairmanship of the Director General of Health Services with representations from&#13;
NGOO agencies has been set up and they are in the process of developing acdvides for the next five years. In&#13;
addition a Director to look after these activities will be appointed under the Deputy Director General of Health&#13;
Services(PHS) in 1996.&#13;
Some of the more traditional aspects of the sector with which the Government has been involved continue to&#13;
be high priority areas for Government intervention. A particular concern is malnutrition, and I note that this&#13;
project includes a separate package of assistance on this, which we enthusiastically welcome. This is a particular&#13;
and probably the most important aspect of the Government's concern to improve cross-sectoral collaboration -&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
- 96 -                           Attachment&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
especially In the areas of nutrition, and water and sanitation- and in the Inter-relationships generally of the&#13;
environment and health sectors.&#13;
As you will appreciate from the foregoing, we are anxious to incorporate and promote change where that would&#13;
be beneficial. But we are equally anxious to protect the very substantial gains which we have made in this sector.&#13;
Thus, radical changes are likely to be neither desirable nor justified. A steady evoludon of policies and their&#13;
implementation are most likely to bear fruit. Moreover, Sri lanka is, I submit, probably in a unique position&#13;
among developing countries - there is probably no other country in the world which has an epidemiological&#13;
profile similar to ours with our modest level of income. Thus, we must also be aware of pre-packaged&#13;
"solutions" to our problems based on other country experiences which may be of limited relevance. We&#13;
welcome exchange of experience of course, and we are eager to learn from other successes and mistakes, but&#13;
standard regional or International prescriptions are unlikely to work In Sri Lanka. Thus, I would stress the need&#13;
for careful study and analysis In Sri Lanka before making policy and strategy change.&#13;
Turning to more specific matters, I am aware from discussions with visiting World Bank missions that the Bank&#13;
has special Interests In particular key aspects of health policy. Naturally, and appropriately, these include the&#13;
flnancial aspects but also spill over into other crucial areas. A brief word on financing - as you are probably&#13;
aware, Sri Lanka has a long history of free social services provided by the Government. This has served us well&#13;
to-date, but we realie that the dme Is now appropriate to review the position. It is a subject which has&#13;
substantial public and political interest, and we must therefore proceed with care to ensure that what is being&#13;
proposed Is sound, thoroughly researched and publicly acceptable.&#13;
The present Government policy of Public-Private mix will be acively pursued where the private medical sector&#13;
will be developed. New legiladon will be enacted to Improve the Private Medical Insttutions of this country.&#13;
A Director, Private Medical Sector Development, will also be appointed to look into these aspects. Further,&#13;
the possibility of Health Insurance development will also be looked Into during the coming years.&#13;
As regards resource generadon in tertiary care health facilides we are in an exploratory state, collecting&#13;
informadon in order to analyze feasible options. Two studies relevant to this issue planned to be undertaken&#13;
are,&#13;
a.     Assessment of the prospects of paying wards In government hospitas as complementary financing for&#13;
hospitals.&#13;
b.     Health Sector reform Initdative in Sri Lanka.&#13;

The first study is already under way and the second one is still in the conceptual stage.&#13;
As the exchanges have developed over the past several years, flve important areas of policy interest of the&#13;
World Bank have evolved many stemming from the original 1995 Health Strategy and Financing Study.&#13;
Considering each of these areas in turn:&#13;
1.    Inuovnmg Quaity and Effkiency in Health Services&#13;
Many of the planned changes will contribute to improved quality; In particular through human resource&#13;
development, better organisation and management and acive community Involvement in health activities.&#13;
Government of Sri Lanka has explicitly declared that the government will improve health facilities in relativety&#13;
disadvantaged parts of the country. The resources and expertise will be made available to upgrade one district&#13;
hospital in each district every year. Each divisional hospital will be provided with basic investigative equipment&#13;
and an ambulance will be made available to each divisional hospital. These initiatives will enhance the efficiency,&#13;
effectiveness, accessibility and quality of health services.&#13;
Quality Improvement Is an Important theme running through the new policy document. Many of the planned&#13;
changes will contribute to Improved quality, especially human resource development, better organsation and&#13;
management, and greater community Involvement. But we also realise, of course, that everything has a cost and&#13;
that resources are very limited. We must therefore Improve service efficiency to ensure better value for the&#13;
resources which we already have. We will also examine new initiadves to ensure that they will not only be&#13;
effective in providing the planned technical improvement but also that this Is done at an acceptable cost. This&#13;
means that macro planning decisions will be based on objective service needs and that technology improvement&#13;
will be integrated Into services after examination of both need and cost effectiveness.&#13;
Specific areas which we will be taking up during the early part of the project period Include: decentralisation -&#13;
following the completion of the study of decentralisation, which is currently well In-hand, we will discuss the&#13;
study findings with the World Bank with a view to agreeing implementable steps to Improve the functioning&#13;
of the provincial and district managers. We accept that decentralisation has proceeded very rapidly and that&#13;
the real benefits especially In terms of exercise of delegated power, proper budgeting, and involvement with&#13;
the local community, have yet to be realised. To ensure effectiveness, the decentralisaton programme will also&#13;
be linked with a program of management training and development. More efficient use of health facilities - by-&#13;
passing of lower level facilities is a serious problem and one which leads to much inefficiency in the system. The&#13;

present experiments to institute a referral system linked to "back referral" will continue and be extended to two&#13;
other districts. Of more general applicability, we will investigate, and introduce where jusdfied, alternative&#13;
schemes for ensuring that the referral system functions and is enforced.&#13;
2.     Phanaceudcals - Although the financial allocadon for pharmaceutdcals has been increasing annually&#13;
from Rs.3 18 million In 1990 to Rs.962 million in 1994 it is about one US dollar per person annually. Sri&#13;
Lanka has developed clearly defined explicit and appropriate policies, strategies, legislative enactments and&#13;
administrative mechanisms to promote accountability in the efficient management and ratdonal use of&#13;
pharmaceutcals. However, it is important to monitor and evaluate the implementation of these strategies.&#13;
Particular focus will be on up-dating and enforcing the essential drug list, encouraging generic prescribing,&#13;
enfordng exisdng drug regulations, discouraging irrational drug promotdonal activities, strengthening human&#13;
resource development and minimising drug wastage.&#13;
The Peoples' Alliance Government has emphasised the need to identify 50 essendal drugs for widespread use&#13;
and wide availability in the state hospital sector. Further, any drug prescibed by a consultant at the Cancer&#13;
Hospital, Maharagama will be provided, free of charge by the State.&#13;
3.     Publc - Prtvate Mbi In die Heald Sector&#13;
The private health sector in Sri Lanka Is largely urban based, and curadve biased In outiook. There are over 800&#13;
general practitioners, 85 private hospitals with over 1800 beds and over 650 retail pharmacies and a few&#13;
diagnostic laboratories in Sri Lanka. It Is estimated that the private sector caters to nearly 50 per cent of the&#13;
patient load.&#13;
The Health Policy has declared that the private sector should be developed to complement and supplement the&#13;
public sector. For this organizadonal and regulatory procedures need to be idendfled and developed and&#13;
strengthened. The government is in the process of establishing a Joint Public/Private Sectors committee to plan&#13;
the essendals. Incendves for establishing private practice in less prestigious areas, encouraging health insurance,&#13;
encouraging the establishment of private training instdtutions and promodng the private operation of hospital&#13;
auxiliary services on contract are some measures to enhance public-private mix in health care.&#13;

There are three specific areas for focussed attendon.&#13;
*      Leasing spare public hospital space to private practitioners - a study i about to begin.&#13;
*      Lease of medical equipment from the private sector - a new area for which a feasibility study would be&#13;
essential; and&#13;
*      Supporting the development of private inpatient facilities in rural areas - this too needs a feasibility&#13;
study.&#13;
The Government will pursue studies In each of these subjects over the coming year and, as elsewhere, will&#13;
discuss the recommendations with the World Bank and Implement agreed steps.&#13;
Preven Mae&#13;
In Sri Lanka a number of areas need more attention. Some persisting health problems are:&#13;
I)     About 34% of children under five are malnourished.&#13;
1i)    About 65% of pregnant and lactating women have Iron deficiency anaemia.&#13;
ilt)    Food and Water borne bowel diseases are widely prevalent.&#13;
Iv)    Malaria continues to be a major health problem. Over four million people In six ditricts are at the risk&#13;
of contracting malaria.&#13;
v)     Mental diorders have Increased from 176.8/100,000 population In 1970 to 247.4 in 1994.&#13;
Among the emerging health problems are:&#13;
I)     Addictions, accidents, suicides and poisoning are emerging serious health problems. Traumatic injuries&#13;
Is the second leading cause for hospitalization In 1994. Pesticide poisoning was the leading cause of&#13;
hospital death in five districts In 1994. There are over 40,000 heroin dependents. Drug trafficking&#13;
is a serious socio-economic problem.&#13;

ii)    Ischaemic heart disease is the leading cause of hospital deaths in Sri Lanka and that in eight districts.&#13;
Cerebrovascular disease the second leading cause of death. There is increased occurrence of both these&#13;
conditions.&#13;
ili)    By the end of 1994 a cumulative total of 145 persons were proved to be positive for Human Immuno&#13;
deficiency Virus(HIV) and 38 AIDS patients have died.&#13;
iv)    Hepatitis B is an emerging health problem among the health workers. The incidence of Hepatitis B&#13;
among blood donors is one per 1000 donors.&#13;
All these problems are preventable. In October 1995 the burden of disease analysis for Sri Lanka was&#13;
completed. This was found to be extremely useful as a key input for further strategic planning in the health&#13;
sector and we are keen to instittionalize it within the ministry. An annual update will be undertaken in future.&#13;
Inter-Secaol Healt, Pocldes&#13;
Inter sectoral collaboration is one of the pillars of the Primary health Care approach. The health sector will work&#13;
closely with other sectors In contributing to health development. Multiple factors contribute to health and&#13;
disease. Education, housing, water and sanitation, social work, community development and agrkulture etc.&#13;
have a considerable impact on health.&#13;
The new health policy directive is that intersectoral collaboration should be strengthened specially in nutrition,&#13;
water and sanitation. A modest beginning will be made in Colombo with a small project designed to improve&#13;
the information system for environmental health projects. More ambitious activities will follow.&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
Sri Lanka is committed to the three pMar approach of Primary Health Care (PHC): Participation,&#13;
Intersectoral Collaboration and Equitr. The Unit costs of PHC are low and it is a form of cost&#13;
effective health care. The equity dimension of PHC concerns those differences in health status and&#13;
access to health care which are vwthin human control.&#13;
Emphasis will be placed on the capacity of health promotion to meet the most pressing health needs&#13;
of our people. Political commitment at the highest evel has been expressed by signing the Charter&#13;
for Health Development for achieving the goal of Health for All by the year 2000. The present&#13;
govemment has indicated measures for health development in its policy statement. We acknowledge&#13;
the importance of intersectoral collaboration, peoples participation and the equity dimension of&#13;
health care provision. The solutions suggested are largely complementary.&#13;
Through pre-project consultation and consensus building among al concerned are vital to&#13;
conceptualize the strategy of the project plan as a unified and integrated policy instrument, so that&#13;
timely and appropriate actons can be taken to implement the necessary interventons for achieving&#13;
the desired objectives.&#13;

HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Management Information Systems Component&#13;
1.         The Ministry of Health has identified the timely availability of accurate health statistics&#13;
and other management information as essential to increasing the effectiveness of the health services in&#13;
Sri Lanka. At present, the limitations are not in the overall reporting systems but are related to the type&#13;
of information available and completeness of reporting. Given this, the project will, through training&#13;
and Information Technology (IT) inputs, provide support to the health system at central, provincial and&#13;
district levels. The goal will be to increase the resources and capacity for production and utilization&#13;
of planning and management information at all these levels, starting at the central (Ministry of Health)&#13;
level.&#13;
Ministry of Health&#13;
2.         Coordination &amp; Information. Considerable information for management is available within&#13;
the Ministry. Typically, such information is collected for specific decisions but is not available for&#13;
general planning and management purposes. This limitation is due partly to the division of activities&#13;
and partly to a lack of resources and procedures for processing and sharing information. Increased use&#13;
of information by MOH requires computerized record keeping systems which will allow access to a&#13;
wide range of information and development of more advanced planning and decision-making systems.&#13;
3.         Planning and Management Information Unit. The project will support an expanded&#13;
centralized information office, the Planning &amp; Management Information (P&amp;MI) unit under the Director&#13;
P&amp;MI in the Management Development and Planning (MDPU) of the Ministry of Health. The activities&#13;
of the P&amp;MI unit will allow new systems to be developed as part of an integrated whole and ensure&#13;
that all information needs are met. The development of the P&amp;MI unit allows for a "critical mass" of&#13;
staff talent to be developed early in the project period. New systems developed over the project period&#13;
will provide the foundation for an eventual evolution of the Ministry's MIS systems to the point where&#13;
all offices of the Ministry will have independent but linked information systems.&#13;
Provincial Level&#13;
4.         Development of the use of information systems at the provincial level is a major goal of&#13;
the Ministry. The project will provide assistance in the design and development of new systems and&#13;
will support the necessary hardware, software and training.&#13;
5.         The first goal is to improve provincial design and use of information systems. Since the&#13;
provinces do not have the necessary resources or expertise to develop new software programs, the&#13;
P&amp;MI Unit, assisted by technical consultancy as needed, will support systems development and&#13;
implementation efforts as well as development of provincial software design capacity.&#13;
6.    The second goal is to improve centralized system design, which will be directed at activities that&#13;
are beyond the capacity of the provinces to design effectively, and where the information and systems&#13;
should be tightly linked to the national level.  The Human Resources Information System (HRIS) is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
one example of this type of system. Others include: drug supply and materials ordering (structured&#13;
systems), and financial management systems (complex accounting and accuracy requirements).&#13;
District Level&#13;
7.         The ADB Project is supporting information system pilot tests at the DDHS level. Under&#13;
the project, support will be provided to expand these pilot tests to the district level by designing&#13;
software in conjunction with the Family Health Bureau (FHB) to increase the collection and use of&#13;
information for management, planning and monitoring purposes. Computers and software will be&#13;
provided on a pilot basis in selected districts. Implementation of the software systems will be a joint&#13;
effort between the FHB and the P&amp;MI Unit, with consultant assistance if needed.&#13;
Functions of the Planning &amp; Management Information Unit&#13;
8.         The Ministry of Health recognizes the need for a single office responsible for the overall&#13;
oversight and implementation of information systems. The new P&amp;MI Unit in the MDPU will be&#13;
responsible for all MIS policy and information-related decisions within the MOH. The P&amp;MI Unit will&#13;
develop integrated plans for increasing the availability and use of information. Health statistics and&#13;
management information will be supported by the Unit through the development of new computer&#13;
systems and programs and through staff training. The Unit will provide support in integrating&#13;
information gathered by other offices, including the Medical Statistics, Family Health Bureau, and IRIS&#13;
units, for use in policy and management decisions. Additionally, the office will provide technical&#13;
support for the provinces in developing appropriate software and systems for increasing the use of&#13;
information for management decisions. An annual report on the progress of MIS in the Ministry will&#13;
be prepared.&#13;
9.         The responsibilities of the P&amp;MI Unit are summarized in the following table.&#13;
Responsibilities of the P&amp;MI Unit&#13;
Area               Responsibilities&#13;
Policy             *  Develop overall MOH policy guidelines for MIS&#13;
Development        *  Convene MIS workshops as necessary&#13;
Planning           *  Prepare annual MIS implementation plan&#13;
* Prepare annual MIS training plan&#13;
Implementation/O    *  Oversee implementation of technical systems&#13;
versight           *  Implement database activities&#13;
* Develop sharing of data with other ministries (i.e. Dept. of&#13;
Census)&#13;
* Prepare annual report on progress of MIS&#13;
Technical Support  *  Develop standards for MOH Systems&#13;
* Assist in purchasing, installation and support of hardware&#13;
* Prepare technical support and training materials for MOH&#13;
computer systems&#13;
* Provide technical support to provincial and district levels as&#13;
needed&#13;

The first two years of the project will be targeted to technical development of the new MIS systems and&#13;
linked training programs. The latter three years of the project will focus on utilization of the systems&#13;
for purposes of improving planning and management at central, provincial and district levels.&#13;
Software Development&#13;
10.        The new software systems to be developed during the project are intended to strengthen&#13;
the overall management capacity of the Ministry, based on increasing the range and quality of&#13;
information available for management decisions. By focusing on a decision support system (DSS)&#13;
model, the P&amp;MI systems will increase overall capacity to effectively utilize information at all levels&#13;
of the health system.&#13;
11.        A study to identify overall Ministry needs for information and information systems is&#13;
currently underway. This study is part of an overall MIS design effort being carried out as part of&#13;
project preparation. The following are areas that have been initially identified as priority information&#13;
systems for development.&#13;

development efforts. Four main areas will be covered by the TA:&#13;
(a)   development of the overall MOH software systems design;&#13;
(b)   programming by the P&amp;MI Unit to implement the required information systems within the&#13;
overall design;&#13;
(c)   design and programming of needed information systems at provincial level;&#13;
(d)   design and programming of needed information systems at district level.&#13;

Core Systems Baseline Data&#13;
13.        Baseline data for a number of purposes will be developed in tandem with software&#13;
development. The first baseline to be developed will be for the health facilities database. The current&#13;
facilities database in the MDPU will be expanded and coding will be standardized. Data will be&#13;
collected concerning the facilities themselves, as well as associated land, equipment, furniture and&#13;
vehicles and the value of these will be assessed. Spatial data will be included to allow the application&#13;
of geographical information systems (GIS) analysis and monitoring techniques. Baseline data collection&#13;
will be a coordinated effort between the MOH (DDG Planning, Director P&amp;MI, DDG Logistics, Project&#13;
Coordinator) and a representative of the Department of National Planning. Initial collection of data will&#13;
be the responsibility of the P&amp;MI Unit. Data will be collected through written questionnaires and&#13;
follow-up on-site surveys. After the initial database is established, information for certain portion of&#13;
facilities will be verified and updated every year. The updating of information should utilize both annual&#13;
reports and operational data such as purchase/delivery data available from the Ministry.&#13;
Equipment&#13;
14.        Ministry of Health. A key responsibility of the P&amp;MI Unit will be the development of&#13;
a linked system connecting MOH offices. This will be accomplished through a Local Area Network&#13;
(LAN). The LAN will allow the Ministry to easily access related information and each functional unit&#13;
to have direct access to information from other units. The system will also meet E-mail and&#13;
communication requirements. Within the MOH building this should not be difficult to implement,&#13;
although there are additional requirements over longer distances (i.e. to link the Ministry to the Family&#13;
Health Bureau building). Provision is made for the following equipment:&#13;
(a)   LAN Network System (Server)&#13;
(b)   System Software&#13;
(c)   Database/Statistical Software&#13;
(d)   Eight PC Computers (P&amp;MI Unit, MDPU, Etc.)&#13;
(e)   Thirty-Four PC Computers (Support of Project Components)&#13;
(f)   Two Laser Printers&#13;
(g)   Two Dot Matrix Printers&#13;
(h)   Miscellaneous Equipment&#13;
15.        Provincial Level. Each province will have a complete installation capable of operating&#13;
the software and systems developed for health statistics and management information. At a minimum&#13;
the system should include:&#13;
(a)   PC Computer&#13;
(b)   Laser Printer&#13;
(c)   Dot Matrix Printer&#13;
(d)   System Software/Applications&#13;
(e)   Power Supplies, etc.&#13;
16.        District Level. Similarly, each district will have a complete computer installation capable&#13;
of operating the software and systems developed for health statistics and management information. At&#13;
a minimum the system should include:&#13;

Training&#13;
15.        Provision is made for technical training of staff and for training of managers in the use of&#13;
information systems for management and decision-making purposes. Experience shows that such training&#13;
is needed to development skills in using available statistical information for more than compilation of health&#13;
indicators. The training to be provided is summarized in the table below.&#13;

HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Burden of Disease Study&#13;
A. Background&#13;
Purpose&#13;
1.         Burden of disease (BOD) analysis is useful for the following purposes:&#13;
(a)  to assist in setting health service priorities, both preventive and curative;&#13;
(b)  to assist in setting health research priorities;&#13;
(c)  to assist in identifying disadvantaged groups and targeting health interventions;&#13;
(d)  to provide a comparable measure of output for interventions, program and sector&#13;
evaluation, and planning.&#13;
2.         These objectives are important in establishing a cost-effective basis for allocation of&#13;
resources among individuals and communities. In any country, there is always a competing demand&#13;
from different sectors for available resources. Generally, the demand for health care is more than&#13;
the available resources, particularly in developing countries where the disease burden is high and&#13;
resources are low. Even in developed countries, it is not possible to address all possible health&#13;
problems with the resources available. Hence, health planners and policy makers need to prioritize&#13;
the available resources to prevent, control and/or treat the diseases which cause maximum burden.&#13;
3.         It should be understood that the BOD results only have value if they are used in actual&#13;
health planning decision making. With the addition of costs to treat and prevent illnesses, the health&#13;
planning computer software is capable of optimizing resource allocation. Together, the BOD&#13;
measure and the cost optimization model can greatly improve the health planning process.&#13;
However, the health planning software with its BOD calculations and optimization models need to&#13;
be placed in the proper context in the health planning process. In order to do this, the health&#13;
planning process needs to be defined and individuals need to be trained in health planning and in the&#13;
use of these measures in the planning process.&#13;
4.         Another benefit of BOD analysis is the opportunity to study health pattems and trends&#13;
over time. If the analysis is set up as a continuing project with annual reviews and updates, it will&#13;
be ideally suited to give health planners valuable insights into disease pattems and trends which can&#13;
guide health resources to emerging problems in a timely manner. In addition, BOD can be used to&#13;
evaluate existing programs to ensure that they focus directly on the most significant health&#13;
problems.&#13;

5.          The cost-effectiveness approach focuses on choosing between mutually exclusive&#13;
interventions. The basic assumption of cost-effectiveness analysis is that health outcomes can be&#13;
measured quantitatively. This allows comparison across the health sector, even if inter-sectoral&#13;
comparisons still remain unfeasible. One possible unit for assessing cost-effectiveness is the&#13;
Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY), which measures both the burden of disease and the&#13;
effectiveness of health interventions as indicated by reductions in the disease burden. Specifically,&#13;
the DALY is the present value of the future years of disability-free life that are lost as the result of&#13;
premature deaths or cases of disability occurring in a particular year. Premature death is the actual&#13;
age at death minus the life expectancy at that age in a low-mortality population. The number of&#13;
years of healthy life lost are obtained by multiplying the expected duration of the condition (to&#13;
remission or death) by the severity weight that measures the severity of the disability with loss of&#13;
life. The death and disability losses are then combined, and an allowance is made for a discount&#13;
rate of 3% so that the future years of life are valued at progressively low levels. Allowances are&#13;
made for age weights so that the years of life lost at different ages are given different relative&#13;
values.&#13;
Limitations&#13;
6.          The disease burden is never the sole basis for health planning decisions, which must be&#13;
made in a social and political context. There are clear limitation to looking only at the disease&#13;
burden. Some diseases with a large burden are not amenable to prevention or treatment, and the&#13;
costs for these diseases may be very high. In addition, since the current disease burden reflects the&#13;
effects of existing programs, diseases may have a low burden because there is an effective control&#13;
program in place.&#13;
B. Sri Lanka Burden of Disease Study&#13;
Data&#13;
7.         A preliminary burden of disease study was carried out in Sri Lanka in October 1995.&#13;
During the first part of the study, approximately 100 disease categories were defined which reflected&#13;
disease pattems in Sri Lanka. Sources of information on disease incidence were identified in Sri&#13;
Lanka for each of these disease categories, and initial estimates of the incidence of disease in each&#13;
of these categories were made. Data was taken from the Sri Lanka 1994 Hospital Morbidity and&#13;
Mortality report recording hospital admissions and deaths for all public sector hospitals in Sri&#13;
Lanka. Since these did not include private hospitals, the Ministry of Health estimated that public&#13;
sector hospitals provide about two thirds of hospital care for most diseases, with the exception of&#13;
some long term care such as bums and mental health services. In addition, approximately 1/6 of the&#13;
hospital admissions were classified as "un-coded" or "unknown". These two factors were combined&#13;
and all of the hospital statistics were treated as incidences. The disability weight, YLD maximum,&#13;
and average age of onset were derived from medical literature references and reviewed and adjusted&#13;
after discussion with the local consultant to better reflect Sri Lankan disease pattems. The computer&#13;
model that was used automates the calculation of the DALY, organizes the data, presents the results,&#13;
and incorporates the ability to optimize resources and to model annual changes in health.&#13;
8.          The data that were collected had some limitations which when adjusted, changed the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
rank order of most of the diseases by a small amount but did not affect the major disease patterns&#13;
identified. Many of the incidence numbers were taken from public hospital discharge records.&#13;
However, at least a third of health care is provided in the private sector. The numbers have been&#13;
adjusted to reflect this by assuming that for most diseases the private hospital cases are&#13;
proportionally the same as the public. In addition, the quality of the diagnosis coding from hospitals&#13;
is highly variable. Incidences of diseases that are usually treated on an out-patient basis are&#13;
primarily derived from limited community surveys.&#13;
Results&#13;
9.          The results are not definitive, since they are based also entirely on hospital data.&#13;
Additionally, neither sex nor age was taken into consideration; these would have had an impact on&#13;
the DALYs had they been incorporated. Only the disease category factors, disability weight, length&#13;
of disease, and age of onset were compared with intemational norms. The incidence numbers were&#13;
verified and validated by local experts and additional sources of statistics.&#13;
10.        The three leading causes of disease in Sri Lanka according to DALYs are injuries,&#13;
ischemic heart disease, and asthma. Injuries and bums constitute 19.8% of the disease burden, but it&#13;
must be noted that rapid industrialization, an increase in motor vehicle use, and most significantly,&#13;
the civil war in the north and east of the country contributed heavily to this high presence. The&#13;
bulk of the disease burden in Sri Lanka is due to non-communicable diseases. Ischemic heart&#13;
disease, diseases of the pulmonary circulation, and other forms of heart disease, which are the&#13;
second and third causes of the disease burden, were the leading causes of hospital deaths in 1993.&#13;
The tropical cluster is an insignificant part of the disease burden (Fig. 1).&#13;
II.        It must be noted that because of their relatively lower durations and lower degrees of&#13;
disability that they cause, most of the communicable diseases do not cause the type of long-term&#13;
disability that is measured by DALYs . For example, relatively common diseases with high&#13;
incidences such as respiratory infections (highest incidence in the country, but duration usually only&#13;
3-4 days) and malaria, did not result in high DALYs, whereas hypertension did.&#13;
12.        Injuries were the second most common cause for hospitalization, but that high&#13;
incidence is primarily due to the current civil war in the north and eastern areas of the country as&#13;
well as rapid industrialization and an increase in motor vehicles in the country at large. The leading&#13;
causes of hospital deaths were cardiac and pulmonary diseases, followed closely by gastrointestinal&#13;
tract diseases and pesticide poisoning.&#13;
Next Steps&#13;
13.        Health Surveys. No further BOD analysis should be attempted until the data base can&#13;
be expanded beyond hospital sources; hospital data are not representative of the burden of disease in&#13;
the general population. For purposes of calculating the burden of disease, household health surveys&#13;
give very high quality information, since they capture all disease, even disease that is treated in a&#13;
non-traditional method, self-treated, or untreated. It is recommended that an annual health survey be&#13;
conducted to measure disease in a statistically significant manner in all areas of the country. Using&#13;
the proper sampling techniques, this need not be a huge undertaking.&#13;

14.        Improved Statistics. The quality of the infonnation that is currently available in many&#13;
disease categories could be improved greatly. Efforts to improve the quality of these numbers&#13;
would include improved reporting, automation of reporting, and refinement of the type of&#13;
information that is reported. Additional sources of infomiation such as private practitioners, NGOs,&#13;
and universities should be included. There are many groups that collect quality information for their&#13;
own purposes, and such infomiation could provide valuable data for burden of disease calculation&#13;
purposes. The disability, age of onset, and length of disability factors that go into the DALY&#13;
calculation would benefit from evaluation by experts familiar with local disease pattems. There&#13;
should be an ongoing effort to review these factors with experts.&#13;
15.        Incorporation of Costs. The health planning software used for this study also has the&#13;
capability to use cost factors (costs to prevent and costs to treat diseases) in an optimization model&#13;
which provides valuable insights to health planners for the utilization of health resources. These&#13;
costs have not yet been determined for Sri Lanka, and this task will be one of the next steps in&#13;
future activities. Local experts need to review the health planning software, which contains costs&#13;
taken from the literature, and derive estimates that are better approximations for Sri Lanka.&#13;

SRI LANKA&#13;
HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Cost-Effectiveness of Project Components&#13;
Malaria&#13;
1.           The revised WHO malaria strategy introduced in 1993 was adopted to improve the&#13;
effectiveness of malaria control in Sri Lanka following resurgences in 1987 and again in 1991. The&#13;
revised strategy emphasizes selective residual spraying using several insecticides as opposed to the&#13;
old strategy of blanket spraying with one insecticide, malathion. Rotation of insecticides reduces the&#13;
chances of the development of resistance, and the new insecticides are also less toxic than&#13;
malathion. The revised strategy also uses mobile clinics for early detection and treatment in high-&#13;
prevalence districts and promotes the use of insecticide-impregnated beds by households.&#13;
2.            The number of malaria cases detected was about 400,000/year in 1991 and 1992,&#13;
declined in 1993 to 363,000, still basically under the old strategy, and declined further in 1994 to&#13;
274,000 under the revised strategy); from January through June 1995, there were only 106,000 cases&#13;
detected. While other factors such as weather and the natural malaria cycle may have been partly&#13;
responsible for the sharp decline in cases, the switch to the revised strategy is likely to have been an&#13;
important contributory factor.&#13;
3.            The introduction of the revised strategy has resulted in significant savings. The total&#13;
amount of insecticide required has been reduced by about 65%, although the cost of insecticides has&#13;
only declined by about 10% in real terms, because the new insecticides being used are more&#13;
expensive than malathion. The reduction in the amount of spraying under the new strategy has also&#13;
resulted in lower labor and other operational expenses for spraying. These savings have been&#13;
partially offset by the costs of additional mobile clinics in the high-prevalence districts. However,&#13;
in the aggregate, total program costs nationwide declined from Rs. 439 million in 1993 (under the&#13;
old strategy) to about Rs. 400 million in 1994, or a decline of about 17% in real terms. Moreover,&#13;
the mobile clinics will be phased out as the incidence of malaria falls below designated levels, thus&#13;
further reducing program costs.&#13;
4.            While precise calculations are difficult, the above discussion suggests that the&#13;
revised strategy for malaria control, which the project will support, is more cost--effective than the&#13;
old strategy--i.e., the cost per malaria case averted appears to be lower under the new strategy. This&#13;
is because, given the sharp decline in cases detected, the total number of malaria cases averted by&#13;
the program per year is likely to be higher under the revised strategy than it was under the old&#13;
strategy, while total annual program cost is lower.&#13;
5.            Additionally, the revised strategy imposes lower costs in terms of environmental&#13;
degradation, because of the large reduction in the amount of insecticide required. The&#13;
environmental benefits also reinforce the conclusion that the new strategy is more cost-effective.&#13;
STD/AIDS&#13;
6.            The Government's program for prevention of epidemic spread of HIV in Sri Lanka&#13;
was developed with technical inputs from WHO and other donors and draws on accumulated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
- 116 -                                 Page 2 of 3&#13;
intemational experience to identify the most technically appropriate as well as cost-effective&#13;
strategies. It emphasizes:&#13;
(a)    diagnosis and treatment of other STDs, since STD patients are a major I-UV risk&#13;
group;&#13;
(b)    a syndromic approach to STD treatment, which entails recognition and treatment of&#13;
STDs at first contact with cases in primary health care facilities;&#13;
(c)    orientation of private sector physicians, who see a large proportion of STD cases;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)   information/education efforts directed at appropriate target groups to promote&#13;
avoidance of high-risk behaviors.&#13;
7.            Education/communication efforts to promote avoidance of high-risk behaviors, which&#13;
are essential to preventing epidemic spread of HIV, are generally agreed to be more cost-effective if&#13;
carried out by NGOs. This is likely to be particularly so in Sri Lanka, which has a strong NGO&#13;
sector. And, in fact, AIDS education/communication efforts in Sri Lanka have been, and will&#13;
continue to be, planned and implemented primarily by NGOs.&#13;
8.            Calculations of cost-effectiveness of the STD/AIDS control program (e.g., cost per&#13;
disability-adjusted life year saved) are difficult because current levels of STD and HIV incidence&#13;
and prevalence are not known with any precision; estimates vary widely. The balance of the&#13;
evidence suggests that HIV transmission in Sri Lanka has been fairly limited so far. However,&#13;
complacency must be avoided.&#13;
Nutrition&#13;
9.           At present, Government's efforts to reduce malnutrition among pregnant women and&#13;
young children center on the thriposha program, which has been under implementation for more&#13;
than 20 years. (Thriposha is the name of a supplementary food; for further details, see Annex 5).&#13;
Expenditure on the production and distribution of thriposha is currently about US$4.5 million a year.&#13;
All pregnant women may received thriposha children are considered eligible if their weight, as&#13;
recorded on growth cards, indicates that they are underweight for age.&#13;
10.          Several evaluations of the thriposha program have been conducted. Based on these&#13;
evaluations, it appears that there is no consistent evidence that the program has been successful in&#13;
improving the nutritional status of beneficiaries. Possible reasons are that the supplement may be&#13;
consumed by the entire family rather that the target beneficiary; that the mother may reduce the&#13;
child's regular food, resulting in no net increase in nutrient intake; and that mothers fail to obtain&#13;
the supplement with enough regularity to have an impact. Since there is apparently no significant&#13;
impact on nutritional status of the intended beneficiaries, it can be concluded that the thriposha&#13;
program has a very low degree of cost-effectiveness (i.e., a very high cost per case of malnutrition&#13;
averted).&#13;
11.          The nutrition component of the project will support a shift to a more cost-effective&#13;
strategy to reduce malnutrition among pregnant women and young children. Available data strongly&#13;
suggest that inappropriate breastfeeding, weaning and feeding practices are responsible for much of&#13;
the malnutrition. This, in turn, suggests that the focus of the existing nutrition program needs to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 3&#13;
shift from the present emphasis on the supply of thriposha to a gzrowth promotion program&#13;
promoting good nutritional practices for pregnant women and young children. Interpersonal efforts&#13;
should be supplemented by mass media campaigns, taking advantage of the high literacy level of the&#13;
Sri Lankan population.&#13;
12.          Growth promotion (Annex 5) can be defined as activities that promote either normal&#13;
growth of a normal child or catch-up growth of a malnourished child. Growth promotion will be&#13;
pursued through growth monitoring--the measurement and recording of a child's weight on the card&#13;
provided to mothers for that purpose--and nutrition education. Growth monitoring is already part of&#13;
the responsibilities of the public health midwives' (PHMs). However, the present emphasis is on&#13;
doing growth monitoring as a means to identifying thriposha beneficiaries. The new approach will&#13;
link growth monitoring to nutrition education instead.&#13;
13.          Because of the way growth promotion activities will be organized and implemented,&#13;
the marginal cost of growth promotion will be low. No incremental staff will be required. The&#13;
PHMs will lead the growth promotion efforts in their communities but will rely heavily on NGOs&#13;
and community volunteers to assist in these efforts. Thus, growth promotion will essentially&#13;
become a community-based program. The public health sector will contribute the necessary training&#13;
and IEC materials. Nutrition education training will be imparted to both PHMs and community&#13;
volunteers. Total incremental cost of the growth promotion program over five years, 1996-2000,&#13;
largely for training, IEC materials and activities, and surveys/studies, is estimated to be US$3.5&#13;
million. The subsequent annual incremental costs of the program would be about US$100,000 in&#13;
1995 prices.&#13;
14.          It is projected that, as a result of the growth promotion program, the number of&#13;
underweight infants and young children would decline from about 500,000 currently to about&#13;
250,000 by 2000. Based on this projection, and the cost figures given in the previous paragraph, the&#13;
cost per case of malnutrition averted under the growth promotion program in the period 1996-2000&#13;
would be about US$5 (the cost per case averted would be lower if a longer period is considered).&#13;
This unit cost estimate does not take into account any additional food costs borne by households,&#13;
however.&#13;
15.          As part of the proposed project, a special effort would be made to monitor the&#13;
ongoing progress and the impact of the growth promotion program. It is hoped that positive results&#13;
of the new approach will provide additional evidence to support phasing out of the thriposha&#13;
program. While, as already noted, previous evaluations of the thriposha program have shown poor&#13;
results, there is currently no consensus within the Government to curtail the program. In order to&#13;
help build such consensus, a condition of the project will be that the Government would conduct an&#13;
impact evaluation of the thriposha program in the first project year, discuss the findings with the&#13;
Association, and implement agreed modifications of the program's scope and objectives based on&#13;
the study's recommendations.&#13;

I.    IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A.    Project Implementation Responsibilities&#13;
Overall guidance for the project will be provided by a Project Steering Committee. The Steering&#13;
Committee will be chaired by the Secretary Health, with the project coordinator as secretary. Members will&#13;
include project component managers and representatives of the Economic Resources Department, the National&#13;
Planning Department and the Department of Budget.&#13;
Overall project management and coordination will be the responsibility of a Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU). The PMU will be headed by a full-time project coordinator, who will report to the Secretary of the&#13;
Ministry of Health. The Project Coordinator will be assisted by a computer analyst, a project accountant and&#13;
office staff. The PMU will be responsible for coordination of annual project reviews, preparation and submission&#13;
of semi-annual project reports, procurement for the project, and preparation of disbursement applications.&#13;
Project Implementation. With the exception of the Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) component, the&#13;
project component will be implemented as part of ongoing programs by the unit of the Ministry of Health&#13;
concerned, as follows:&#13;

B.    Supervision Plan&#13;
1 .    IDA's Resident Mission in Sri Lanka will be responsible for monitoring of project progress.&#13;
2.     Formal project supervision will be based on regular six-monthly review missions. Before the start of&#13;
each mission, the PMU will circulate the six-monthly progress report, which will focus on outstanding issues in&#13;
addition to being a concise progress report. Missions will take up disbursement and procurement matters as&#13;
necessary.&#13;
3.    In about December of each year, there will be a joint annual review by IDA and GOSL as appropriate.&#13;
This annual review will, inter alia, review the semi-annual report, assess project progress, propose solutions to&#13;
identified problems, and review and agree on annual action plans for the coming project year.&#13;
4.    In about June of each year, there will be a technical review mission which will review the semi-annual&#13;
reports and focus on substantive technical issues of project implementation for each of the project components.&#13;
5.     The first review mission will include a project launch workshop. The workshop will ensure that all&#13;
officials concerned are fully familiar with the details of the project including first year implementation and plans&#13;
for monitoring and evaluation. IDA procurement, disbursement and other procedures will be reviewed with the&#13;
PMU.&#13;
6.     A mid-tern review, expected to be carried out prior to June 1999, will evaluate the project thoroughly,&#13;
assess to what extent objectives are being met, identify changes needed to improve effectiveness, and modify as&#13;
necessary the project design and detailed content.&#13;
7.     A supervision plan is given below.&#13;

IV.  MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
A.        Monitoring Indicators&#13;
Process, output, and impact indicators are indicated. Input indicators are available from the&#13;
detailed cost tables. It is assumed that the procurement, supply, installation, etc. of inputs will be monitored.&#13;
For process and output indicators, how the various indicators will be operationalized and&#13;
reported will be determined jointly by the individual programs and the project office. In some cases, the specified&#13;
indicators are already monitored but reporting of the data collected to the Ministry of Health needs improvement.&#13;
In other instances, additional monitoring will need to be introduced on either a program-wide or a sample basis.&#13;
For example, detailed monitoring of the reoriented growth promotion program in all areas would not be practical;&#13;
instead, in-depth monitoring of sentinel divisions in all provinces will provide guidance for the larger program.&#13;
Key performance monitoring indicators have been agreed by IDA and the Government of Sri&#13;
Lanka and are given in the following Table.&#13;

B.    Progress Reporting&#13;
The PMU will be responsible of ensuring that baseline and other studies that will be required for impact&#13;
assessment are carried out. the implementing units of the Ministry of Health will be responsible for ensuring that&#13;
input and program monitoring data are obtained and submitted to the PMU on a regular basis.&#13;
The PMU will submit to IDA semi-annual reports reviewing project progress and problems for the period&#13;
under review and cumulatively. One month prior to the beginning of the project year, the Government will&#13;
submit to IDA annual action plans for the coming year covering each component for comment and approval by&#13;
IDA. Prior to June 30, 1998, the Government and IDA will carry out joint mid-term review of the project, and&#13;
following the review Government will implement agreed recommendations.&#13;

            The objectives of the Health Services
            Project for Sri Lanka are to strengthen the
            Government's ability to address: a) remaining major
            public health problems (malaria, malnutrition and HIV/AIDS);
            b) new challenges raised by the epidemiological transition
            and the increasing importance of non-communicable diseases
            of adults; and c) key health policy and financing issues. To
            achieve these objectives the project will comprise the
            following components: a) malaria component; b) Sexually
            Transmitted Disease (STD)/AIDS component; c) nutrition
            component; d) non-communicable diseases; e) program support
            component, which contains three subcomponents: health
            policy, management information systems and health education.
