            Saving viable businesses : the effect of
            insolvency reform
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The 2008 financial crisis and consequent
            rise in corporate insolvencies highlight the clear need for
            efficient bankruptcy systems to liquidate unviable firms and
            reorganize viable ones and to do so in a way that maximizes
            the proceeds for creditors, shareholders, employees, and
            other stakeholders. This note summarizes the empirical
            literature on the effect of insolvency reforms on economic
            and financial activity. Overall, research suggests that
            effective reforms increase timely repayments, reduce the
            cost of credit, and lower the rate of liquidation among
            distressed firms.
