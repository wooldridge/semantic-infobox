&#13;
BECKER: This is William Becker with the Business History Group and the George&#13;
Washington University. It's October 25th, and we're about to begin an interview with Mr. Ismail&#13;
Serageldin.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: I'm Marie Zenni, task manager of the World Bank Group Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I'm Ismail Serageldin, former vice president of the World Bank and currently&#13;
special advisor at the World Bank and also Distinguished Visiting Professor at AUC (American&#13;
University, Cairo), and advisor to the Egyptian government on the Library of Alexandria project.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It's a pleasure to meet you. We'd like to begin by talking very briefly about your&#13;
background and your education. What if anything in your background, would you say at this&#13;
point, most influenced your career at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I think it would have to be my parents instilling in me very early on an&#13;
interest and inquisitiveness in many different topics, and, as a result, I've always had a very wide&#13;
range of interests. Even though I started my career as an architect, I was always interested in the&#13;
context of things, and so in getting into buildings I wanted to know how buildings are set in&#13;
cities. So I went into city and regional planning and why cities shape up the way they do, which&#13;
leads to regional planning. Then I got my master's degree and from that into how regions actually&#13;
grow. And that gets you into economics and national development policy. I did a lot of&#13;
economic work on development policy and then later on to more or less an abandonment of&#13;
conventional economics, because I was convinced that development, which is where my heart&#13;
was getting more and more into, was much more about people than it is about accumulation of&#13;
capital investment ratios and capital output ratios and all that stuff that we were being taught at&#13;
the time.&#13;
&#13;
And so by 1968--I recall very well--I spoke to my very distinguished advisor, who incidentally&#13;
wrote the first history of the World Bank. Mr. Edward Mason was my advisor at Harvard, and I&#13;
remember meeting with Professor Mason and saying, "You know, everything you've told us in&#13;
economics is all wrong!"&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "That's a rather sweeping statement!" He said, "Mr. Serageldin, would you care to&#13;
elaborate?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said that, you know, if we could with a magic wand remove the capital constraints from&#13;
developing countries, they would still be less developed countries. On the other hand, in Europe&#13;
after the war an infusion of capital with the Marshall Plan allowed them to rebuild because of the&#13;
quality of their human resources. So it's really about people, not about money.&#13;
                                       M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                              October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And he says, "What do you want to do?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I want to cross register into the School of Education.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And so for the next year and a half I cross registered into the Graduate School of Education and&#13;
took a lot of courses on special tutoring in education. I wrote my thesis on the contribution of&#13;
education to development. And so that's this constant search for broadening and understanding&#13;
the context of "why": why are things the way they are, and do we have the right tools to ask the&#13;
questions? I think this is part of what helped me shape my career in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Incidentally, it was this also that got me to the World Bank because Ed Mason then asked me,&#13;
"What would you like to do now that you're finishing your doctorate at Harvard?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Before going back to Egypt, I would like to get some international experience."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Indeed, and where would that be?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, either UNESCO, back to UNESCO, or ILO [International Labor Organization],&#13;
maybe. Mostly UNESCO would be my first choice because of education and so on.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Couldn't you go to the World Bank?" Now this was '72; he was just finishing his&#13;
master work on the Bank at the time.&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, I've left my engineering behind me right now. I've been practicing for seven or&#13;
eight years to support myself and my family. I was practicing in urban and regional planning in&#13;
the U.S., but mostly urban planning, but that was to support my studies. And I wanted to really&#13;
go into education in depth."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "There is more education at the World Bank than both UNESCO and ILO combined." I&#13;
was very suspicious about that. And he said, "Why don't you try it?"&#13;
&#13;
So I applied to the Bank. It was very unusual. It took them quite a while to respond to me and&#13;
then gave me a double offer: as a YP (Young Professional) or as a regular staff member,&#13;
because I had eight years of experience. I was very young when I went to university; I was 15,&#13;
and I graduated at 20, and I did my eight years of graduate studies. So I was 28 when I came to&#13;
the Bank, but I really had eight years of professional experience behind me at the time plus my&#13;
degrees.&#13;
&#13;
So they offered me both, and I asked, "What's the difference in pay?"&#13;
&#13;
They said, "The same."&#13;
&#13;
                                     M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       3&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What's the difference in assignment?"&#13;
&#13;
They said, â&#128;&#156;The YP program allows you to do more than one assignment.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "Okay, I'll take the YP program because it allows me to do more than one assignment&#13;
with the Bank."&#13;
&#13;
And I started in the Bank on a very historic day in the Bank, which was October 1, 1972, the day&#13;
of the implementation of the [Robert S.] McNamara regional reorganization of the Bank. So I&#13;
arrived in the Bank, and it was a madhouse: brown boxes everywhere. [Laughter] People didn't&#13;
even know who they were reporting to on the first day of the reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
But, anyway, I got in, and I started in the Education division of the then EMENA region&#13;
(Europe, Middle East and North Africa). Initially I thought that I would stay maybe two years in&#13;
this place and find out what it's like. And it was a terrible place. You wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t believe this. At&#13;
the time, the debate in the World Bank was whether it was legitimate for the World Bank to be&#13;
concerned with income distribution.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Income distribution how?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: This had been triggered by a livestock project in Brazil the year before, where&#13;
the Bank was offering below market rate loans in those days. And people said, â&#128;&#156;The only&#13;
beneficiaries out of this loan would be people who have huge ranches with hundreds of&#13;
thousands of heads of cattle and so on, and why should we be offering World Bank loans for&#13;
people who have villas on the Riviera and fleets of Mercedes cars? I mean, does that make&#13;
sense?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And the answer at the time at the Bank was, "Yes, the job of the Bank is to increase the size of&#13;
the pie. How it's distributed internally is a domestic political matter. It should not be the job of&#13;
the Bank."&#13;
&#13;
And of course to me, coming with the background I was coming with, the instinct of&#13;
development being of people and that economics is only a tool to improve the well-being of&#13;
people, this is a crazy debate! How can people even talk about development if they're not&#13;
willing to discuss poverty and income distribution and so on?&#13;
&#13;
And I've told Bob McNamara--who became a good friend recently, but of course at the time I&#13;
knew I couldn't; he was the president of the Bank--were it not for him, I would definitely not&#13;
have stayed in the Bank, because McNamara then, in 1973, made a decisive move for the Bank&#13;
with the Nairobi speech. At the time we had the Montek Ahluwalia and Hollis Chenery&#13;
â&#128;&#156;redistribution with growth,â&#128;? which was simply saying that you can't have a distribution with&#13;
growth. Today it works the right way; we would say, "Redistribution for growth." [Laughter]&#13;
But in those days it was simply very apologetic; I mean how to prove that it was not a trade-off,&#13;
                                      M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       4&#13;
&#13;
that you could have both. And then McNamara made the decisive Nairobi speech saying the&#13;
lower 40 percent of the income distribution are going to be our primary clients. And then he&#13;
used words that really touched me--and I've told him this many times sinceâ&#128;&#148;he said absolute&#13;
poverty is a condition beneath any definition of human decency.&#13;
&#13;
And then he had a meeting (which he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t even remember) which really changed my career.&#13;
He met with a group of young people who were called the â&#128;&#156;Five-Thirty Clubâ&#128;? in those days,&#13;
which was a small group of young people of the Bank who would meet at five-thirty in room&#13;
A530. And we invited him, and he came. And he said, "I'm looking to you to help me change&#13;
this institution and turn it around." I had been moved by his speech, and when I heard him say&#13;
that, I said, â&#128;&#156;Going to stay another two years! Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to work for this guy and help turn&#13;
around this institution!â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Well, two years later I was made a division chief, so I said, "I think I'll stay another two years."&#13;
And I'll stay another two years and another two. I've been staying another two years for 28&#13;
years! And now I completed what I had told Professor Mason, which was I wanted to get some&#13;
international experience before going back to Egypt, except it took a little bit longer than I&#13;
thought! It took 28 years of international experience rather than two or three years.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, aside from these early experiences with McNamara, what other positions then&#13;
in the Bank most influenced the direction of your career and your thinking about what needed to&#13;
be done in regard to sustainable development?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I think it's the other way around. My career in the Bank was largely driven by&#13;
what I wanted to do, and I've been very privileged to do this. This is one of the reasons why I've&#13;
very little sympathy for the staff who complain all the time about this and that. I have no&#13;
sympathy for that at all! I've never been constrained in doing what I wanted to do in the Bank.&#13;
I've never been rapped on the knuckles for speaking my mind, even when I disagreed violently&#13;
with the eminent people in the Bank in those days, and--until recently, I mean. You don't suffer&#13;
for taking risks, for doing what you want to do, if you're forceful enough about your ideas. And&#13;
it's true the burden of proof is on the person who wants to change how things are done, and that's&#13;
the way it should be. This is a lending institution; itâ&#128;&#153;s a financial institution, and you just can't&#13;
sort of throw money at any idea that comes along. You therefore have to say to people,&#13;
"Convince us that these ideas are worth supporting."&#13;
&#13;
But I've never had that problem. And, in fact, I've refused to do things that I was told I should for&#13;
my career, such as, â&#128;&#156;Work outside of operations, do a stint in Finance, do a stint in&#13;
Administration. This is good for you for your future career.â&#128;? I was offered, early on, with the&#13;
division chief. I was offered to take on the job of Director of Administration. It was a very big&#13;
department in those days. And I said, "No."&#13;
&#13;
"But, you know, this is a fast track career to vice president."&#13;
&#13;
                                      M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                              October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  5&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, that's not what I came here for. If I wanted to take care of the garages and the&#13;
cafeterias, I would have joined Marriott.â&#128;? [Laughter] â&#128;&#156;I mean, I came here because I wanted to&#13;
work on development problems in poor countries. And so if I don't get promoted, I don't get&#13;
promoted. If it delays my promotion, so what!â&#128;? You know, as I retire now, what difference does&#13;
it make that I became a director in '84 or '83 or '86? What is more important is that I enjoyed&#13;
every minute of the career. When I offer my advice to anybody who asks me I tell them, â&#128;&#156;You&#13;
better take a job that gets your juices flowing, that makes you want to get up in the morning and&#13;
go there and that you're doing not as a stepping stone to something else but because of the&#13;
intrinsic value of what you're doing.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And that's why, for example, I also refused to leave Africa when I, after I got into the Africa&#13;
region, saw the enormity of the problem there. That took three consecutive directorial&#13;
assignments in Africa. And I was advised, "This is not good. You have to go somewhere elseâ&#128;?&#13;
and so on.&#13;
&#13;
"No, this is where I think the biggest development challenge is, where the biggest public&#13;
problems are. I'm going to stay here."&#13;
&#13;
They said, "It's not good for your career."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Fine! At some point I can always resign." [Laughter] So I've never had this view that&#13;
somehow the incentives are this, the incentives are that.&#13;
&#13;
I spoke to a Friday Morning Group upon my retirement, and I said, "You know, this incentive&#13;
stuff is really a lot of nonsense. I think people should have an internal incentive. They should,&#13;
like Henley's 'Invictus,' say, â&#128;&#152;I'm the captain of my soul! â&#128;&#152;I'm the master of my destiny!â&#128;&#153; And do&#13;
whatever you think is right.â&#128;? I mean, they shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t be responding to incentives like, you know,&#13;
Pavlovian dogs who do this only if they get an incentive for it. People should be doing what they&#13;
think is right. And I think there's a lot of people at the Bank who do this, and they do very well.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now eventually, though, you moved to be the first vice president for&#13;
Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development. How did that come about?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Okay, you want to track the career? I can run through the career, because&#13;
there are a number of important points. I started out in the Education division. I then transferred&#13;
to the Programs division.&#13;
&#13;
And just to show you again that you could do all sorts of amazing things, in the Education&#13;
division I was also responsible for designing programs that really involved NGOs [non-&#13;
governmental organizations] in a big way, like in the Yemen II Education Project. This was the&#13;
first time we created something called the Basic Training Fund where the idea was that the local&#13;
villages and local development associations would decide. But there were no reasons to call&#13;
them NGOs. They were called local development associations. And these LDAs would&#13;
                                       M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     6&#13;
&#13;
contribute--I said they should contribute one quarter of the cost and we the Bank provide through&#13;
IDA [International Development Association] the other three quarters, which is demand driven,&#13;
ownership and all that stuff. [Laughter] It was already embedded in 1973-74 in those days, and&#13;
it was an unusual concept in those days. And it was approved by the Board and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Later on, I was given the task of dealing with the oil countries, but I also insisted on still&#13;
retaining a link with some of the regular countries. I used to go to some of the richest countries&#13;
in the world and some of the poorest--Yemen and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and so on. But&#13;
Yemen--North Yemen was very much like some of the African countries inside the EMENA&#13;
region! So I was doing some of that.&#13;
&#13;
But as division chief of technical assistance and special studies, I was also able to launch a lot of&#13;
research projects that responded to my academic interests. And I did launch a number of very&#13;
major projects, one which was on literacy retention and one which was on manpower flows. And&#13;
the one on manpower flows really created the best team in the world in those days at the World&#13;
Bank. We created some very complex models which I was involved in developing and so on.&#13;
&#13;
And then the Bank decided to tell me I absolutely needed to move back to mainstream&#13;
operations. I was having a field day doing all very interesting things, because I was doing&#13;
everything from appraising petrochemical projects with, of course, Saudi Arabia, and we did an&#13;
appraisal a la Bank, except that instead of going to the Board it went to Minister [Mohammed&#13;
A.] Abalkhail, who was minister of finance in those days. We advised the Saudis in their early&#13;
dealings on a lot of different things--housing, roads, transport, industry, manpower flows,&#13;
education, literacy, also cultural studies on the sanitization of nomads. We did agricultural&#13;
evaluations for Libya, the new town designs for Kuwait, and a lot of very interesting studies,&#13;
plus the academic type research studies, two huge research studies that I was running. They said,&#13;
"Now we really need you to take on a division and just the regular type of work of the Bank."&#13;
And they shifted me to the Urban division. So I went and worked there for three years.&#13;
&#13;
And this is an important story because it is a compelling argument against the nonsense about&#13;
incentives. I had a very, very good division--outstanding staff--and we took major risks. Two of&#13;
those major risks were, one, to go forward with a major project for a new town design in Egypt&#13;
called the Al-Abour, where I pushed through an appraisal and then it was killed at the Bank, and&#13;
the other was to help Yemen in post-earthquake reconstruction. And I pushed it through to&#13;
negotiations, and then it collapsed because basically the Yemen government was more interested&#13;
in getting funds from Saudi Arabia than from IDA, partly because we put so many restrictions on&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the main thing is that, in Bank parlance, to have two projects that you take post-Loan&#13;
Committee and then get cancelled is considered a public disaster. But at that point I was given&#13;
another huge triple job promotion from staff member to division chief--I was never "senior"&#13;
anythingâ&#128;&#148;so I went from regular staff member to division chief, and I went from division chief&#13;
to director. And we had assistant directors and division directors. And I was given this huge&#13;
                                       M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  7&#13;
&#13;
promotion to become director of West Africa under [Wilfried P.] Thalwitz.&#13;
&#13;
The story I want to say is this: I called my staff together to announce to them that I was leaving&#13;
them, and I said, "I want you to look at this promotion as a very important signal that the senior&#13;
management is giving you. By conventional bureaucratic norms we just had two huge failures--&#13;
two projects that have gone through the Loan Committee and which were cancelled thereafter.&#13;
They were calculated risks, and I had made the case through the Loan Committee why we should&#13;
try for these projects, and as you can see Management did not hold this against me. In fact,&#13;
they're promoting me. So I hope that you will see this as a signal not to be scared. If you have a&#13;
convincing case of why you should do something, go forward with it!"&#13;
&#13;
And after I left, my deputy then told me, "Oh, you know what happened after you left the&#13;
meeting? People said, â&#128;&#152;Yeah, it's true it happened, but it's an unusual case. We know how the&#13;
system really works!â&#128;&#153;â&#128;? [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
I mean, you canâ&#128;&#153;t win, right? [Laughter] But this is nonsense. I have no sympathy with this at&#13;
all! I mean, hereâ&#128;&#153;s my own career, and I told my staff, â&#128;&#156;Look at this case. This is what&#13;
happened: Al-Abour failed, and the Yemen earthquake project failed post-Loan committeeâ&#128;&#148;I&#13;
mean, just disastrous by conventional bureaucratic terms. They were both very fast track&#13;
projects. And yet, you know, it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t held against me.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
What happened there was that Ernie [Ernest] Stern and Wilfried Thalwitz selected me for this&#13;
job, and I had a discussion with Ernie. Wilfried is a good friend; he had done the nomination for&#13;
me, and Ernie agree to it. Ernie called me in and said, "Look, we're going to put you through&#13;
tests, so you have to understand that this is not a permanent appointment. It's a two-year&#13;
appointment. If we don't like you, we won't bring you in.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
I said, "You know, you can have my resignation on your desk anyway, because I wouldn't want&#13;
to work if my boss didn't have confidence in me. So it's as simple as that; that's not an issue for&#13;
me. You either have confidence, or you don't. So the issue of probation doesn't really matter to&#13;
me at all. But, you know, why did you choose to put me in West Africa which I know very little&#13;
about? I could have served you extremely well in EMENA where I know everybody and speak&#13;
the language. I know the culture and most of the decision-makers throughout the Middle East&#13;
and North Africa very well.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
He said, "No, we want you there. This is a region where the Bank is making a very major effort;&#13;
we are about to launch the new special facility for Africa and so on, with a new structureâ&#128;?â&#128;&#148;Kim&#13;
[Edward V. K.] Jaycox took East Africa, Wilfried Thalwitz came in, Sven Sandstrom, Callisto&#13;
Madavo, myself, Caio Koch-Weser, all of these were a new team that was being brought into&#13;
Africaâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;and we want you there." Then he added something which was very moving, and I saw&#13;
him recently and he spoke about it again. He said, "You know, it's not that you work hard; a lot&#13;
of people work hard. It's not that you're smart; there are a lot of smart people in the Bank. But&#13;
two things are important as to why you should go for this job. First, you don't get discouraged,&#13;
                                       M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    8&#13;
&#13;
and this is a region where, you know, it's so hard to make things work, some of the poorest&#13;
countries in West Africa. The second reason is that I think you have the compassion to really&#13;
care for the people there and not get overcome by the problems of the bureaucracies in the&#13;
governments.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And that's true; I got very moved working in Africa. And that's the reason why every time there&#13;
was a reorganization, I said, "No, I want to stay in Africa." And so I took three consecutive&#13;
assignments in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
And Moeen Qureshi, when he became senior operations vice president, said to me, "You must go&#13;
to either Asia or Latin America."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "No, if I take a technical department, it shall be in Africa because that's where the&#13;
technical challenges are biggest."&#13;
&#13;
Then came the issue of environmental sustainable development. I had been in Africa a very&#13;
strong supporter of women's programs. I had launched the first two projects for women. I got&#13;
Michaela Walsh, who was then head of Women's World Banking, to come (out of the directorâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
budget, not the divisionâ&#128;&#153;s budget) and go and try to create the first micro project for women in&#13;
The Gambia. I got a number of operations going--in spite of Cote dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire being in the midst of&#13;
structural adjustment--within the environment project and the women's project. I said this has a&#13;
signal value, that everything else we are doing in structural adjustment is because of the macro&#13;
and sectorial problems, that we are going to do specific projects, two tiny projects, one on the&#13;
environment and one on women, as a signal.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: In those years I had been very concerned about environmental degradation in&#13;
Africa: deforestation; desertification; water problems; women's problems. I was involved with&#13;
creating the social dimensions of adjustment projects in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
I had expressed an interest for my next promotion, so to speak--if I would be promoted--that I&#13;
would be very interested in [Visvanathan] Rajagopalanâ&#128;&#153;s job, which was in the DEC&#13;
[Development Economics] group, or in the central vice presidency, where we had the Chief&#13;
Economist on one side dealing with all the macro stuff and then we had Rajagopalan dealing&#13;
with all the sector stuff. I was a projects man by background, and I wanted very much to take&#13;
along these responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
I was then called and told that the intention is to create not one but three vice presidencies,&#13;
thematically grouping some of the sectors that were under Rajagopalan. One would be&#13;
Environmentally Sustainable Development and would I be willing to take that? One was human&#13;
resources, and one was private sector development. Human resources was given to Armeane&#13;
Choksi, and private sector development was given to Jean-Francois Rischard. And would I&#13;
                                        M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  9&#13;
&#13;
consider it? I said then, "Yes. In fact, I would prefer it to human resources,â&#128;? even though my&#13;
original background was education, because I had done a lot of work on human resources and&#13;
because I felt, in fact, that the intellectual work on human resources had largely been done.&#13;
&#13;
By that time we had won the battles of the Bank being involved with primary education, girls'&#13;
education and all of these issues. These are some of the early debates I had with Duncan&#13;
Ballantine, who was then director of education at the time, when he said, "Why should we be&#13;
concerned about literacy?" And I talked about human rights, and he said, "That's not an&#13;
economic term!" [Laughter] A lot of fascinating debates in those days! John Simmons and I&#13;
and others were sort of the radicals of the education group in those days. But these battles were&#13;
largely over. It was much more a matter of implementing programs; whereas, I felt that in the&#13;
whole area of environment and sustainability we were still groping for a way out. And I had&#13;
participated because by that time you recall that Thalwitz had taken over as senior vice president&#13;
of policy--and then by that time we had four senior vice presidents--and he had been my boss for&#13;
many years.&#13;
&#13;
I was working with Kim Jaycox in Africa in those days as director of the technical department,&#13;
and I was pushing policies on the questions of forest policy. He said, "I understand that you&#13;
preempted the Bank's forest policy by issuing your own policy."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "No, I was very careful in my monograph that was published before the Bank's policy to&#13;
leave wiggle room for the Bank, but I clearly spelled out my ideas, and I make no apologies for&#13;
it!"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "No, it's very good. I like what you wrote!â&#128;? [Laughter] â&#128;&#156;So I want you to work with&#13;
Michel Gautier and Andrew Steer.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
I had been put in charge of the environment preparation of our WDR [World Development&#13;
Report] on environment for '92, and that had been a big battle with Mohamed El-Ashry and the&#13;
economists and so on. And I was one of the technical directors involved in that. And then when&#13;
that issue came up, I was very interested in trying to help with that part. I was then offered by&#13;
Sven Sandstrom, Ernie Stern in particular, and [Attila] Karaosmanoglou, who was still Managing&#13;
Director (before Gautham Kaji took over), to take on this job of ESD. And I said, "Yes, I would&#13;
very much like to do that."&#13;
&#13;
Now the Bank at that time was in very bad shape.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What year would this be?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: It was October of '92, where we had to reorganize to be effective on January 1,&#13;
1993. It was exactly 20 years to the day, almost, when I joined the Bank, from October â&#128;&#152;72 to&#13;
October â&#128;&#152;92.&#13;
&#13;
                                     M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   10&#13;
&#13;
And Lew [Lewis T.] Preston, God rest his soul, was a man I was very fond of. He said to me,&#13;
"Now I want you to take on this Environmentally Sustainable Development and make it a&#13;
reality!" [Laughter] And then he said, "I understand we're giving you the hot seat, but I&#13;
understand that you thrive on it."&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "Well, thank you, sir. I hope we won't let you down."&#13;
&#13;
At the time the Bank stand had been trashed in Rio [United Nations Conference on Environment&#13;
and Development]. There was a lot of opposition to the Bank. The â&#128;&#156;Fifty Years is Enoughâ&#128;?&#13;
campaign was really starting to pick up steam. It was a difficult time in '93 in terms of criticism&#13;
of the Bank, and so I was front and center on dealing with these issues. And I agreed with Sven,&#13;
who was then the Managing Director I was working with on a daily basis, I said, "I'm going to&#13;
spend a good deal of my time on external relations for the Bank because we really can't afford to&#13;
have the people who should be our natural allies, the NGOs who care about poverty and care&#13;
about the environment, care about development, be the ones attacking us! It is ludicrous! These&#13;
are natural allies. These are the people who should be out there lobbying Congress and lobbying&#13;
the Parliament for more money for IDA. I mean, we must build good relations with them. And&#13;
I'll take on this task and give it a good deal of my time."&#13;
&#13;
The first year I was in charge, Raj continued to be chairman of the CGIAR [Consultative Group&#13;
on International Agricultural Research], so I did not take on the CGIAR until January 1, 1994.&#13;
Lew Preston said, did I mind that. I said, "No, out of respect, of course, for Raj, I'd be delighted&#13;
to let him continue in that post. Iâ&#128;&#153;d be honored to take it on afterwards.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
In the meantime, I focused a lot on building these relations. The first task I did was to really try&#13;
to build better contacts with the critics and engage them in listening, debating, arguing with&#13;
them--improving the quality of our own reasoning. I found that the biggest challenge we had, I&#13;
thought, was that we really did not have enough of a comprehensive framework to pull things&#13;
together. And so the manifestation of these two orientations--building networks and reaching out&#13;
outside of the Bank, and at the same time bringing in the ideas of the others and then trying to&#13;
consolidate them into a coherent thinking--led to two initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
One was the launching of the Hunger Conference, which was triggered by the hunger strike that&#13;
Tony Hall had made in Congress when they abolished the Hunger Caucus and where we said we&#13;
would hold a conference. Sven said to me, "You think we can deliver on that?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Don't worry, Sven. If you, as acting president of the Bank in those days, will make the&#13;
commitment, I'll deliver!"&#13;
&#13;
That was in April of that year, and we held it in December; it was a big event with 1200 people&#13;
who came. We took American University and invited and obtained Jimmy Carter, Amartya Sen,&#13;
et cetera; all these are personal contacts. That was an effort to dialogue with the NGOs. It was&#13;
difficult because, of course, they looked at us with enormous suspicion. But, luckily, I had&#13;
                                        M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                               October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 11&#13;
&#13;
enough personal contacts with many of the NGOs over the years that they were at least willing to&#13;
talk to us. We built that relationship as we went along.&#13;
&#13;
The other was to launch the idea of the ESD Conference, which we held at the time of the&#13;
Annual Meeting in September 1993. I wanted to get Al [Albert A. Jr.] Gore for the opening&#13;
conference, but I also wanted to get one other very distinguished man. I was very happy I got&#13;
that person: Jacques Cousteau. Captain Cousteau came as the first keynote speaker that we had&#13;
at an ESD conference, and Al Gore came the next year. And every year after that, for five years,&#13;
it was a big event. And it then got bigger and bigger, and it really became a rallying point where&#13;
we got everybody, and there were associated events, and more and more associated events, that&#13;
showed that we were getting people together.&#13;
&#13;
So these were some of the big challenges.&#13;
&#13;
Now the intellectual challenge of trying to weave this together finally took manifestation into&#13;
something which I personally gave a big push to, which was the notion of wealth accounting and&#13;
indicators. Wealth accounting is a way of bringing in the produced assets or conventional&#13;
measures of economic capital.&#13;
&#13;
If I may just go back for one minute, I felt the big problem we had was that the whole world had&#13;
gone on the wrong track based on the [Gro Harlem] Brundtland Commission's definition of&#13;
sustainable development, which was to meet the needs of the present generation without&#13;
jeopardizing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, which is philosophically&#13;
very appealing but operationally non feasible. Simply stated: how to define needs. For starving&#13;
people it's pretty straight forward, but for families that already have two cars and three TVs,&#13;
what does that mean? Yet we know it is the latter kind of family that consumes 85 percent of the&#13;
world's output.&#13;
&#13;
So we are talking about sustainability. The needs criterion is not an operational one. So I&#13;
suggested that if you change it slightly and you put sustainability as opportunity--in other words,&#13;
it is to give future generations as many opportunities as we have had ourselves, if not more--it is&#13;
very close to the Brundtland definition, but this one is operational, because if you can translate&#13;
opportunity into being capital per person--if my son has more capital than I've had, he has more&#13;
opportunity to generate an income services stream. Now the meaning of capital is broad. It is&#13;
produced assets; it is natural capital or itâ&#128;&#153;s bio-diversity, land, et cetera. It is human capital:&#13;
education, health and nutrition, which is embedded in the person; and social capital which is the&#13;
institutions that allow a society to function, the glue that holds a society together. And what&#13;
you're saying is by putting it on a per capita basis, you take into account the population growth.&#13;
And you're saying what we want to do is give future generations, per capita, as much if not more&#13;
basket of these four kinds of capital as we had before.&#13;
&#13;
Conceptually, what this does is that it also resolves a lot of the problems that people get caught&#13;
up in--how to deal with non-renewable resources, copper in the ground, for example. Do you&#13;
                                       M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                            October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   12&#13;
&#13;
leave it for future generations or you take it out? It's non-renewable. I once told one of the&#13;
NGOs, "What's the difference between having no more copper in the ground or having copper in&#13;
the ground that you don't use? What's the difference between the two?â&#128;? But you see, by allowing&#13;
these four kinds of capital, youâ&#128;&#153;re ending up saying, "Yes, it does make sense to remove copper&#13;
from the ground and invest in educating little girls." You're transforming one form of capital&#13;
into the other. Now, at the same time the substitutability exists, but they are also complements,&#13;
because you can't close your eyes and imagine anything taking place if you drive any of the four&#13;
kinds of capital to zero. You need all four of them. And that allows you, therefore, to have a&#13;
definition of sustainability that is operational.&#13;
&#13;
The question was: can we measure it? So I launched two big projects and supported the two&#13;
Johns [Laughter], John O'Connor first and then John Dixon later on, to take on the task of&#13;
measurement. And we produced two books, one called Measuring Developmental Progress and&#13;
the other called Extending the Measures of Wealth, which is more accurate, but the narrower&#13;
base of first one was just to prove it. And I put out a little booklet called Sustainability and the&#13;
Wealth of Nations, which I'm very proud of. It got a distribution of 3000 copies in Xerox form&#13;
before it came out in printed form. And I'm very proud of that because that thinking earned me&#13;
an honorary doctorate from the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers in France. And that&#13;
one, of all my doctorates, is the one that I'm most proud of, because in 200 years they gave only&#13;
two honorary doctorates, one to Robert Solow and one to me. And I'm very flattered to be in&#13;
Bob Solow's company! [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, in redefining capital and broadening the notion of capital, was there resistance&#13;
to this within the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: A lot. But in effect it came out. It had a huge, very positive public relations&#13;
impact, because even people who disagreed with me on certain things, like Bob Solowâ&#128;&#148;I mean,&#13;
Bob said to me, "I am opposed to your concept of social capital." I think it means something, as&#13;
he contributed to a chapter in the book on social capital and produced that part in his book the&#13;
last year. He said, "I'm opposed to it. I think it's important, but it's not really capital unless you&#13;
can say that--what the rates of accumulation and depletion are; what the input-output ratios are--&#13;
you shouldn't call it capital."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Bob, you're unfair. You're comparing us to human capital, but that's human capital&#13;
after 35 years of intellectual investment. What you should compare us to on social capital is&#13;
where we were on human capital in the late â&#128;&#152;50s--1960, before Gary Becker put out his Human&#13;
Capital, 1964, and all of that work. Everybody agreed there was something important there but&#13;
we couldn't quite capture it. And so now we're just at the beginning stages of thinking about&#13;
social capital. You have to accept that it's not human capital.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
If you look at Somalia and Yugoslavia--enormous differences in human capital! Both societies&#13;
disintegrated. Liberia and Lebanon went through civil wars, enormous differences in human&#13;
capital. Itâ&#128;&#153;s the glue that holds a society together. We don't know how to measure it. We have&#13;

                               October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 13&#13;
&#13;
been struggling with that.&#13;
&#13;
I had invited Bob [Robert D.] Putnam earlier on; I launched a big campaign on culture and&#13;
development in '91-92. There was a big conference in '92 in Africa--the time I was still director&#13;
in Africa--on Culture and Development. And I called it â&#128;&#156;Culture and Development in Africaâ&#128;? so&#13;
that nobody would ask me why I was doing culture and development Bank-wide. But it was&#13;
Bank-wide! [Laughter] And world-wide! And I got Robert Putnam, who became famous&#13;
afterwards for publishing his work. This was before he published the '93 milestone work on how&#13;
democracy works and then later on Bowling Alone. And he presented his work at the Bank.&#13;
We're getting into some thinking here that is very important.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Were your academics working on this idea, too?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: A lot of it I did. I had enormous networks of academia friends. My obstacles&#13;
were all inside the Bank! [Laughter] They weren't outside the Bank, largely because there was a&#13;
lot of neoclassical economic thinking that dominated everything. It wasn't always like that. I&#13;
remember when I first joined the Bank in '72, the engineers ruled the roost and the economists&#13;
were considered largely irrelevant. It was only in the â&#128;&#152;80s that the economists took over, but by&#13;
the â&#128;&#152;90s they were sort of, of course, the dominant force--and still are the dominant way of&#13;
thinking in the Bank, and the net result of this.&#13;
&#13;
Now I'll give you two examples of that, one of which was I kept sending lot of things to friends&#13;
who were chief economists of the Bank: the late Michael Bruno, a very fine gentleman, truly a&#13;
macroeconomist's macroeconomist, the very, very best of them. Michael said to me, "You know,&#13;
of all the things that you keep sending me, the only one I cannot dismiss is Putnam because of&#13;
the quality of his empirical work. And I want you to know that I've invited Bob Putnam to come&#13;
and speak to our economists at the Bank and so on."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Michael, I'm delighted that you're doing this, but I want to ask you a question. Why&#13;
would you want to dismiss an idea?" [Laughter] Even if its badly formed, maybe there's&#13;
something here that's worth exploring. But he said he thinks most of the other things are wishy-&#13;
washy and woolly and not rigorous, and Putnamâ&#128;&#153;s work is based on empirical data. But it shows&#13;
...&#13;
&#13;
Larry Summers, with whom I've had many wonderful relations, is a man of enormous&#13;
intellectual integrity. And if he became convinced of something, he would take on any issue no&#13;
matter how unpopular, including, for example, when he became convinced of the issue of girls'&#13;
education, made that very influential investment in all the people. And he went and said it in&#13;
Pakistan. But Larry is like--it's a bit like dealing with the American legal system: if you present&#13;
your evidence in a certain way, you get a fair hearing; if you present it in another way, it's ruled&#13;
out of order and dismissed! [Laughter] And you've got to present your argument in a very&#13;
convincing economic way, and he would take them on. And so I had wonderful dealings with&#13;
him. For example, he accepted very much issues of investment in girls' education and so on, but&#13;
                                         M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;

&#13;
he did not accept--at least during the three years he was hereâ&#128;&#148;when we discussed issues about&#13;
population in Africa, and he said, "Show me why population growth is necessarily going to have&#13;
a major impact on economic well-being per person."&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: One other question about the NGOs. The Bank's contact with NGOs has increased&#13;
considerably in recent years. How is that working? Is there a point of diminishing returns in&#13;
trying to deal with these groups?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I don't think so. What we have to realize, of course, from my perspective, is&#13;
that the world is changing. And the manifestations of that change is that the state, which is the&#13;
building block of the post-World War II economic system, has largely become too big and too&#13;
little. It's become too big to deal with the citizens as human beings; it seems bureaucratic,&#13;
distant, and so on. And it's become too little to cope with international issuesâ&#128;&#148;environmental&#13;
issues that require collaboration and cooperation, and trade issues. You have to get collaboration&#13;
between states to get most of these, be it capital flows, et cetera. As a result, there's been a&#13;
redefinition of the role of the state, increasingly from doer and as a primary agent of instrument&#13;
of development, towards being the enabler and the regulator and, of course, the sovereign creator&#13;
of the enabling framework, the enabling environment.&#13;
&#13;
And as a result, the two forces that are coming forward are, on one hand, the private sector (and&#13;
it's increasingly recognized in public-private partnerships and so on) and, on the other side, civil&#13;
society. While economists and politicians have largely accepted the private sector, they are still&#13;
in the process of accepting civil society. And civil society, of course, is not a homogenous group&#13;
which is well organized and that has a chamber of commerce that can speak for it and so on or a&#13;
business round table that can speak for it. It is very atomized, very different shaded groups of&#13;
many, many manifestations, some of which are single issue groups, some of which are multi-&#13;
issue groups, some of which are very strident, some of which are very reasonable, some of whom&#13;
are very grassroots action oriented, some of whom are policy advocacy groups. All of that fits&#13;
under the heading of a civil society. But if you look at the world today, I think any rational&#13;
person would say, "This is a reality." And thus the notion of "Why do we deal with them?" is&#13;
ludicrous. [Laughter] It's like saying, "Why do we deal with the private sector?" Obviously, you&#13;
have to deal with the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
And if we can measure, of course, with much greater success, saying simply that the capital&#13;
flows, private capital flows versus public capital flows and so on, showing the importance of the&#13;
private sector that has gone from being less than one third of public capital flows to being five or&#13;
six times the size of the public flows, it is no less important to understand, even if we can't&#13;
measure it in the same way, that there is a civil society that is emerging and that the Bank cannot&#13;
ignore that civil society any more so than any individual government can.&#13;
&#13;
Increasingly, of course, we're seeing these voices expressed sometimes in private terms--in&#13;
                                       M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 15&#13;
&#13;
Seattle, in Prague--sometimes in more sensible terms through thoughtful NGOs like WWF&#13;
[World Wildlife Fund],like IUCN [International Union for Conservation of Nature], several with&#13;
whom we have had strong and excellent partnerships. So to me there is no issue of whether we&#13;
must deal with them, and there is no such thing as, "Letâ&#128;&#153;s not deal with them." You're dealing&#13;
with them like you deal with the private sector. Things change. In the private sector world it&#13;
becomes international flow versus local domestic capital markets, et cetera. You deal with it as&#13;
an ongoing, changing relationship in the same way on the NGO side.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the growth of the Bank's relationship with NGOs has coincided largely, of course, with the&#13;
arrival of Jim [James D.] Wolfensohn, even though Lew Preston was certainly willing to deal&#13;
with NGOs and was very patient. Lew Preston was the U.S.'s most eminent banker when he&#13;
became president of the World Bank. He told us once, "You know, I just sat here being lectured&#13;
to by a 20-year-old girl about how I didn't understand what was going on in the world economy.&#13;
It's kind of fascinating to understand that these people consider us to be arrogant." [Laughter]&#13;
But Lew, while a wonderful human being, was not a good communicator. He was very ill at&#13;
ease in dealing with the rough and tumble of some of the political nature of the open process.&#13;
&#13;
Now, Jim Wolfensohn is not only a born communicator, he is an outstanding visionary and an&#13;
enormously able communicator and networker and builder, and that in a sense--he intuitively felt&#13;
all these issues about development being for people when he said this about a smile on a childâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
face, when he said all those wonderful things when he first joined the Bank. These clearly were&#13;
his innate feelings, and he communicated them extremely well and thus was able to launch a&#13;
series of alliances with NGOs which I think were extremely powerful and helpful to the best&#13;
movement in that sense.&#13;
&#13;
I find, for example, that in my dealings with NGOs--I was in charge of one of the most difficult&#13;
exercises the Bank has ever had to deal with, which is the Resettlement Review. In '93 it was&#13;
started after Narmada, which was a disastrous project where we had not effectively followed our&#13;
own rules. I was asked by Lew Prestonâ&#128;&#148;and Ernie Stern was there, and he was in charge of&#13;
following that up, to do a 100 percent review of every single project now before us: 142 projects.&#13;
When I took on that job from Raj, first I looked at it, then I went back, and I said, â&#128;&#156;We wonâ&#128;&#153;t do&#13;
it on that. I want an extension of at least eight months on the commitment to the Board. I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
care what you sold to the Board! Iâ&#128;&#153;m willing to go to the Board and talk with them, because&#13;
what we really want to do is not to say, â&#128;&#152;We have visited these projects and here's what we&#13;
found;â&#128;&#153; instead, we want to be able to say, â&#128;&#152;We have visited these projects and here's what we&#13;
found, here's what we did about it, and that's what the status of the project is.â&#128;&#153; So we really need&#13;
to do that, and that means two visits per project, and that mean I need at least six months&#13;
between visits and that I need to report afterwards.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And we pursued that, and we involved a lot of the NGOs--local NGOs and others--in the design&#13;
of how to rectify things. When we went on those missions we ensured that specialists went&#13;
along, not just engineers who were mostly concerned about civil works and not enough about the&#13;
resettlement, and that those people would go there and say to the local officials--the central&#13;
                                      M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                              October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  16&#13;
&#13;
government, local government, local inhabitants and local NGOsâ&#128;&#148;say to them, "Look, whatever&#13;
happened, happened. We're now here. How are we going to get out of here? How are we going&#13;
to make it better? Let's sit down. Let's work out a plan together. Let's hammer it out, everybody.&#13;
We reach agreement on that and come back six months later to see whether it's on track or not."&#13;
&#13;
As a result of that, we came up with a report which has been largely accepted despite--&#13;
incidentally, there were emails going around on the Internet at that time. Bruce Rich was trying&#13;
very hard to find ways of discrediting this report before it came out. But it is quite compelling&#13;
that there were no leaks of that report until it was ready to go. I'm very flattered, and I think&#13;
Sven Sandstrom should be also very flattered, that he and I met with the Board and asked them&#13;
for a very special favor. After his initial contact, I then had to meet with the whole Board over&#13;
lunch, and I said to them, â&#128;&#156;I would like you to trust me to release this report without your seeing&#13;
it.â&#128;? And this was quite a . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Courageous move on your part!&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: No! Well, this is why I have no sympathy for people saying you can't do&#13;
things in the Bank. Itâ&#128;&#153;s unbelievable!&#13;
&#13;
We had 21 out of the 24 directors who came to that lunch. Now remember, this was the â&#128;&#156;Fifty&#13;
Years is Enoughâ&#128;? campaign during the â&#128;&#153;94 annual meetings in Madrid. So I said, "I would like&#13;
to ask you to trust me on this. I think it would be disastrous for the Bank if we release this&#13;
report. It will leak before we get a chance to present it, and we will be defined by the critics of&#13;
the Bank. Let us at least get our story right in the beginning.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And, most importantly, the directors for India and Indonesia said to me, "Mr. Serageldin, we&#13;
know our governments are going to be criticized, but will you promise us that we shall be treated&#13;
fairly?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "I promise you."&#13;
&#13;
And I also promised the Board that there would be no policy-making. The report was not going&#13;
to recommend a change in policy or anything that would preempt the prerogatives of the Board.&#13;
It was a report on what we found on the ground and what we did about it, and, therefore, in no&#13;
way did it preempt anything the Board would have to say. It was a factual report of what we&#13;
found on the ground and what we did about it. And they authorized it. And therefore what we&#13;
did, we arranged for a release of the report at nine a.m. to the Board, at which time we discussed&#13;
with them what the press release would say. At eleven a.m. I went down and released it to the&#13;
press. And we put the proper perspective on that, that in fact resettlement in Bank financed&#13;
operations was less than three percent of total resettlement, that those three percent were&#13;
infinitely better treated than the 97 percent who were in projects that were not funded by the&#13;
Bank, and that we had found some discrepancies in the way the Bank had been acting vis-a-vis&#13;
some of these projects, that we tried to fix them, and here's how we fixed them. And we found&#13;
                                        M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                               October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  17&#13;
&#13;
some success stories which were reported on as well. And that was the basic message that went&#13;
out.&#13;
&#13;
It was very well accepted. Michael Cernea was extremely active on this; he gave lectures all&#13;
over afterwards about it. It was very well received in many parts of the world. So, in effect,&#13;
that's another example of how, in dealing with the Board or in dealing with Management or with&#13;
NGOs, you really can do a lot of things. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
So the NGOs are there to stay. How we work with them, I think, requires--you have to be open--&#13;
-and in my dealings with them, I have found that we can agree to disagree. And we have to be&#13;
firm about that. When we did the ESD Conference, I said, "Look, this conference is a Bank&#13;
conference. You may suggest things to me, but who we invite, how we invite--that's the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
decision. This particular event is a joint event, so you and I have to agree on everything in it.&#13;
This event is one where I will offer you space, and you can hold your own event.â&#128;? If you're clear&#13;
on that from the beginning, people don't get upset.&#13;
&#13;
When we had the Dams Commission launched later on, and somebody said, "Well, you know,&#13;
there is a moratorium on the Bank funding dams until the results . . ." We never agreed to a&#13;
moratorium! You have to be crystal clear on this: â&#128;&#156;There's a policy in the Bank, and it stands&#13;
until it's changed, and thus the Bank is not going to have a moratorium on funding dams just&#13;
because you say soâ&#128;?.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I could talk to these people in this way, and I'm happy to say that in a separate event when&#13;
I ran in my personal capacity for Director General of UNESCO, even though I didn't get it, many&#13;
of those people supported me. They wrote letters of support; they signed declarations of support;&#13;
eminent environmentalists and so on were all very strong supporters. So your credibility with&#13;
them, the way you deal with them I think is dependent on just being straight, consistent and&#13;
clear. But we have to deal with them.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Could we return to the question of environmental sustainability? The OED has been&#13;
critical in its findings that there are some inconsistencies in the Bank's approach. What's your&#13;
view on that?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, my view is very clear on this. This is one of the few times that I've had&#13;
a major disagreement with the management of the Bank and where, in fact, my views did not . . .&#13;
[Laughter] I thought--still do--that there should be an independent environmental and social sign&#13;
off on the main safeguard policies and that is not within the regional vice presidents.&#13;
&#13;
I've had some serious problems with the reorganization that's taken place within the last few&#13;
years, in the sense that I thought in the matrix structure, the thematic versus the geographic, there&#13;
has been a very strong bias towards thinking the geographic rather than the thematic. And that's&#13;
because we never accepted the view--which I believe in and which, I think, some of my&#13;
colleagues like Jean-Francois Rischard also believe in--that we should go all the way. And "all&#13;
                                        M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                               October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  18&#13;
&#13;
the way" means that you must have all the staff, technical staff, under the thematic leaders. They&#13;
report to the thematic leaders, not to the regional vice presidents. The regional vice presidents&#13;
have nothing to say about a thematic staff!&#13;
&#13;
Now, in order not to go back to the old projects departments that were highly insensitive to local&#13;
conditions, the demand driven part is totally in the hands of the geographic departments. The&#13;
money is in the geographic, but they have no staff of their own and they have no authority to go&#13;
outside of the staff of the Bank, saying, "I'll hire a consultant." This would enable the thematic&#13;
staff to say, "You want to do an agriculture project in this country? We have to invest so much&#13;
to do a proper job on it. And if you want to do it for less than that, it will not be a good project.&#13;
We can't accept that. You can't do things on the cheap, and we're responsible for quality. We're&#13;
going to insist on that.â&#128;? Now, if it leads to the geographic directors saying, for example, "Okay,&#13;
then I won't do an agriculture project, and I will do a transport or an education project," we catch&#13;
them. That becomes the strategy paper. So we all sit together and report to them and say,&#13;
"Okay, if this is the situation in this country, why are you putting in industry and electricity and&#13;
you're not dealing with education and health and agriculture and forestry and so on? I mean,&#13;
what kind of strategy is this! If these are the problems of the country, what kind of strategy is&#13;
this?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
So you have those checks and balances, but you can't have a situation where people who report&#13;
to the same managers are the ones who are responsible for insuring the quality. In commercial&#13;
banks the people who do the risk assessment for the institution are never the same who do the&#13;
trades. I mean, take Mr. [Nick] Leeson, who brought down the Barings Bank; this was one of&#13;
those cases where the fire walls had broken down, and most people accept that.&#13;
&#13;
Now the World Bank does not have a financial risk. It has an enormous reputational risk! And&#13;
to me the same situation stands, that therefore the people who do the sign off on what is a&#13;
reputational risk of the Bank on this operation should not be the same ones who are responsible&#13;
for doing the actual operation, in the sense of those who are doing the trade. I do not believe that&#13;
any institution that is a knowledge-based bank and that is geared to excellence in quality can&#13;
function without the systematic peer review. I don't know of any! And I'll give you a very&#13;
important example.&#13;
&#13;
Long before biotechnology became an issue, I commissioned a report by a very eminent group of&#13;
scientists headed by the late Nobel Laureate Henry Kendall. And Henry said to me, "Why are&#13;
you coming to me? I'm a physicist."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "I'm coming to you for two reasons. You're the founder and chairman of the Union of&#13;
Concerned Scientists, and you drafted the â&#128;&#152;Scientists Born into Humanityâ&#128;&#153; in Rio, and it was&#13;
signed by sixteen hundred scientists, one hundred Nobels and so on. Your environmental&#13;
credentials are impeccable! But you also understand good science, which is not the case on this&#13;
issue and wouldn't address issues of what are the risks of unwanted lateral gene flow. I want&#13;
some good science behind this before I advise the Bank and the CGIAR on what we should do."&#13;
                                       M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So we arranged to get together a team of the best people in the world to be on the committee:&#13;
Jozef Schell; Roger Beachy; Fred Gould, who later was also with the National Academy of&#13;
Sciences report,; [M. S.] Swaminathan of India; Peter Raven, who was the Home Secretary of&#13;
the U.S. National Academy of Science, et cetera. When these people completed the report, he&#13;
called me up and said, "You know, we finished our report now"--we had a closed circuit internet&#13;
that I was watching; things that were for me to see--"As you know, we finished our draft. And&#13;
we will arrange for a scientific peer review, but we would like you to nominate two people from&#13;
the World Bank to participate in this peer review." Now, I cite this. Here is a Nobel Laureate,&#13;
top scientist in the world dealing with an issue on which arguably they could say, "What the hell&#13;
does the World Bank know about the risks of lateral gene flow in our related speech?â&#128;?&#13;
[Laughter] But to them it is so much second nature to think in terms of peer review that he&#13;
called and said, "Would you arrange it?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Yes, I'll be honored!" And I arranged for peer reviews.&#13;
&#13;
Now, when I came around and I said, "I want the project that this guy is doing to be peer&#13;
reviewed by people outside the Bank": â&#128;&#156;Oh, you don't trust our task managers? What is this&#13;
checks and balances business?â&#128;? They are not living in the real world. There's no place that I&#13;
know of, no journal, no scientific grant making that is done without peer review. And peer&#13;
review means "independent" peer review. It doesn't mean two guys reporting to the same&#13;
manager looking at each other's work and saying, "Sir, you think this should go forward?" Or&#13;
people who are forced to relate to other people because they are hired on the project and they&#13;
would be told, "Well, they are a problem. We shouldn't give them--they have to fill their â&#128;&#152;dance&#13;
card,â&#128;&#153;â&#128;? as they call it right now.&#13;
&#13;
When I published an essay in Science and submitted it, it was peer reviewed. The editor sent it&#13;
back, saying, "Here are the comments of the peer review." I took them into account to the extent&#13;
that I felt I should, sent back my amended paper, and it was published. I mean, this is normal&#13;
procedure. And the fact that we're not doing it in the Bank I think is wrong, and therefore I think&#13;
we should be much more systematic about it, about calling the level that's required. And that&#13;
will require investment, and a level of investment that I think is going to be extremely important,&#13;
that we should be able to give it as much as we do, because our reputation risk is real.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What about the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: OED is more of an ex-post body, and what we got instead was the QAG&#13;
(Quality Assurance Group). And the QAG is really a body that is on a data sampling basis. It's&#13;
better than nothing, but I wanted 100 percent--no samplings--100 percent, every single operation&#13;
that has to be done. I wrote three memoranda (before Jim Wolfensohn joined us) on quality. I&#13;
was very harsh. They were highly confidential. I wrote my colleagues in very harsh language,&#13;
saying, "We are remiss in our responsibilities as managers of this institution if we don't&#13;
recognize the quality problem we have," and that there is a serious quality problem. I believe&#13;
                                      M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   20&#13;
&#13;
that what we did for the Resettlement Review should be done for all the safeguard policies, 100&#13;
percent. There's no such thing as sampling, choosing, selecting. Every single project has got to&#13;
be looked at. And I think it would not be that costly. I estimated that we could do it for 20&#13;
million dollars which, in a budget of 1.4 billion, is not a huge amount. But we would ensure then&#13;
that the safeguard policies are truly looked at.&#13;
&#13;
And the reason Iâ&#128;&#153;m so adamant about that--I'll give you one story from the Resettlement Review.&#13;
One-hundred and forty-two projects were reviewed which were under implementation; thirteen&#13;
were under preparation with the enormous flood lights that were put onto this at the time. The&#13;
Resettlement Review at that time was under considerable scrutiny such as newspaper coverage,&#13;
the â&#128;&#156;Fifty Years is Enoughâ&#128;? campaign, the Board, monthly reports to the president of the Bank&#13;
about how it was progressing, how many missions have gone and so on. Of one of those&#13;
operations a staff member said, "Ah, about 500 people will be resettled." Okay, we go back later-&#13;
-six months later--and it's 16,500 families! I ask you: if this had been dollars, if a staff member&#13;
had estimated the cost of an operation at $500,000, and then came back six months later and said&#13;
that it's $16,500,000, do you think that person's judgment would not have been called into&#13;
question? Do you think that the managers of that person would not have rapped him or her on the&#13;
knuckles and said, "What the hell? What kind of a person are you?" I mean, that's not a minor&#13;
fine tuning! [Laughter] The orders of magnitude are different! Why is it that because it was&#13;
human beings rather than dollars, ah! We shrug it off? The managers never sanctioned him. I&#13;
was furious about that.&#13;
&#13;
That particular case is an example that this is outrageous and that it is not actually being&#13;
followed up on. It shows an attitude of â&#128;&#156;this is an add-on,â&#128;? and that highlights the fact that if it&#13;
was done in the midst of the Resettlement Review which was busily engaging all the vice&#13;
presidents and so on every day of the week, if that was happening in the projects under&#13;
preparation, it strengthens me in my belief that systematic peer reviews are the only way to go,&#13;
and I think that we still should.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, the Bank is, until recently, acknowledging failings in its resettlement policies.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Yeah. Resettlement, like everything else, like environment, is not something&#13;
that you do on the side. There are specialists. We accept that financial matters require financial&#13;
specialists, economics require economic specialists, legal issues require lawyers, engineering&#13;
issues require engineers. Well, resettlement and environment also require specialists not&#13;
generalists! And we're not willing to make that investment, and we're not willing to&#13;
systematically backup the technical specialists in their judgments. And I think it's something we&#13;
should do.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What is the value added in having the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which was&#13;
created in '91?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN:         Excellent. That deals with issues that you can't deal with otherwise. I mean,&#13;
                                     M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                            October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  21&#13;
&#13;
it does recognize the reality. Like if you look at the bio-diversity, the costs of protecting are&#13;
local but the benefits are global, and therefore the difference between global benefits and what's&#13;
covered by local benefits and local costs with the differential that local costs are higher than local&#13;
benefits, then the differential between that should be covered by a grant, and the GEF is&#13;
presumed to do that. It does not provide diversity for all the conditions for climate change and&#13;
for international waters. It's an extremely important instrument.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: We'd like to turn to the advantages of consultative groups, in particular the CGIAR.&#13;
Do you think the Bank makes the most of its relationship with consultative groups in terms of&#13;
helping to focus on issues and mobilize resources?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: No, because you're talking in the plural. I think the only truly great success&#13;
story we've had has been the CGIAR and, to a lesser extent but well on its way, the CGAP&#13;
(Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest), the micro-finance program, and the third one, which&#13;
could be much better, is the Global Water Partnership.&#13;
&#13;
Part of that has really been the lack of willingness to make the same level of commitment which&#13;
was made in 1971 to the CGIAR. At the time, it was Bob McNamara sitting with Maurice Strong&#13;
and with many others who simply said, "Okay, the U.S. would take 25 percent and the Bank 10&#13;
percent, and let's get on with the show!"&#13;
&#13;
And somebody said, "How about a secretariat?&#13;
&#13;
He said, "We'll fund the secretariat and take it off the table so we don't spend time arguing about&#13;
who funds what and so on."&#13;
&#13;
And that's worked extremely well for 28 years, going on 29 years now. And I think we should&#13;
learn that lesson.&#13;
&#13;
The other one where we have done extremely well has been the River Blindness Program.&#13;
&#13;
Now all of these programs have a logic, and the logic is that these are multi-year long-term&#13;
efforts dealing with a problem. And this business of exit strategy doesn't make sense. You're not&#13;
in the business of getting out of agriculture research, and you're not going to be out of river&#13;
blindness until you've licked the river blindness. And the micro finance program, we should not&#13;
be out of micro finance until we really get the world to see the change. And, in the same way,&#13;
dealing with water issues which are not country specific nor sector specific but where aggregate&#13;
water parts should be there, we need to continue to be a creator of that in a big way. These are&#13;
relatively small amounts at issue; we could begin, and we need to put them in a much bigger&#13;
way, a much more systematic way, over time. The payoff from that would be huge. It is simple.&#13;
&#13;
                                      M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                              October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                22&#13;
&#13;
Look at the World Food Prize, which is the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for agriculture. There&#13;
was no Nobel Prize for agriculture, but Norman Borlaug, who won his Nobel Prize for peace,&#13;
created the World Food Prize. And he's now been pretty much recognized as having the Nobel&#13;
Prize for Agriculture. The number of CIGAR scientists who have won the Nobel for agriculture&#13;
is enormous. It's almost 45 percent of all winners, and that includes people who are politicians,&#13;
like He Kang off China. It includes people who have dealt directly with poverty, like&#13;
Mohammad Yunus of the Grameen Bank. And it includes everybody who deals with hunger and&#13;
food security. This year two ex-scientists won for the high quality for tomatoes, and they got&#13;
that prize. [M. S.] Swaminathan got that prize; [John] Niederhauser got that prize; Hank [Henry&#13;
M.] Beachell and Gurdev Kush got that prize; and Hans Herren got that prize and so on. And&#13;
really itâ&#128;&#153;s a very impressive list.&#13;
&#13;
The systematic ex-post evaluations show that the returns on investments have been anywhere&#13;
from 22 percent to 191 percent--enormous rates of return comparing favorably to everything we&#13;
do. And I've challenged many of the donors, saying, "Show me where in your portfolio you have&#13;
anything dealing with agriculture that comes close in terms of rate of return, even close, not&#13;
better, just comes close!" And therefore we should be continuing the support.&#13;
&#13;
So I think that, in essence, we haven't done enough in these areas. I think part of the problem has&#13;
been trying to put these under the DGF [Development Grant Facility]. And putting it under the&#13;
DGF, the DGF council therefore gets very annoyed because you get a huge hunk under some of&#13;
these programs. These are separate kinds of programs. The consultative groups would be&#13;
outside the DGF officials; they have their own governance structures that involve all the donors&#13;
who are anyway members of the Board. And, therefore, we should have a different way of&#13;
funding them.&#13;
&#13;
And therefore the short answer is no, we have not done as much as we could in that area, with&#13;
the exception of the CGIAR and to a certain extent the River Blindness and the CGAP. Global&#13;
Water Partnership is less, but I can see many others where we are needed.&#13;
&#13;
What we have done extremely well has been consultative groups for countries. But again, that&#13;
reflects the Bank's construct, which is much more geographic than thematic. We do much better&#13;
on that because we have lending programs for individual countries, and people who speak on&#13;
these countries represent the Bank in much more direct way.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What were the circumstances surrounding your appointment? I think again that it&#13;
was the first ever vice president for special programs.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, that was really an agreement with Jim Wolfensohn, who was interested&#13;
in promoting culture and a number of other initiatives at the time.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And the year was '97?&#13;
&#13;
                                     M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  23&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Late '97, early '98. At the time, I had been about six years in my job and it&#13;
was time for a change, and I wasn't very clear on what the alternative or next step would be. I&#13;
enjoyed being in ESD. The intellectual content was there. My disagreements were narrowly on&#13;
the issue of reorganization and peer reviews--systematic reviews--of the SECAL [sector&#13;
adjustment loan] policies, but aside from that, I mean this is where we were.&#13;
&#13;
When that issue came up, I had discussions with Jim. And he wanted to do culture right now,&#13;
but added to the things that I was dealing with--which included the ESD vice presidency,&#13;
CGIAR, GWP [Global Water Partnership], CGAP, plus other initiatives including the inter-faith&#13;
dialogues--the culture would be a lot. â&#128;&#156;You either should split the job or give me a deputy.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
So, de facto, we split the job. And this is not new. The same thing happened at the level of&#13;
director with Mohammed El-Ashry when he was director of Environment and had Andrew Steer&#13;
as his deputy plus you are dealing with the GEF. At some point we said, "You know, we have to&#13;
split the job." With two jobs, then Andrew became director of Environment without a deputy&#13;
and Mohammed El-Ashry took on the GEF.&#13;
&#13;
"Well, let's split the job. But what would the job include?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, all the parts that I would like to keep intact--on ESSD, I've done my major&#13;
thrust of what I wanted to do there, and, you know, I think the time has come for renewal there,&#13;
anyway, but the CGIAR, the Global Water Partnership, all these things I would like to keep, and&#13;
of course I'll be very honored to take on the responsibilities that you want to give me in culture,&#13;
promoting culture and inclusion.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And so we said, "Well, what kind of a vice presidency would that be?â&#128;? They were all kind of a&#13;
very special pack of programs involved. â&#128;&#156;Why don't we call it Vice President of Special&#13;
Programs?" [Laughter] And that's how Vice President of Special Programs was created. It was&#13;
created very much as a tailor-made job for me to deal with these particular things. I am very&#13;
grateful to Jim and Sven and to others for their willingness to consider this as a very special job.&#13;
&#13;
Now what I agreed on at the time was, I said, "Okay, the way I want to do this, drawing on my&#13;
experiences in posts, dealing with the GEF and dealing the Social Dimensions of Adjustment in&#13;
Africa, is that we need to have some buy-in from the various regions. I don't want the whole&#13;
independent staff dealing with these things. We will work with the others through listing&#13;
arrangements and a little bit of out-sourcing of funds.â&#128;? These were provided by the President's&#13;
contingency, and we started.&#13;
&#13;
I set out the strategy on March 30, 1998. I gave my maiden speech in that post. I'd been in the&#13;
post five days. I went to Stockholm for a big conference and presented the strategy of what the&#13;
Bank would do within the next 18 months, and the Bank did it. Within the next 18 months it was&#13;
all done, which included conceptual work, a number of pilot projects, strengthening linkages and&#13;
networks with those dealing with culture and establishing the Bank's presence in that. And we&#13;
                                      M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                              October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              24&#13;
&#13;
had a big exhibition and conferences, ultimately ending with the one that was jointly organized&#13;
in Florence. And so that's how that came about, and I'm very grateful for the confidence of Jim&#13;
Wolfensohn and the willingness of Sven and others who really supported this.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What remains to be done on that? What has happened to this vice presidency?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, the vice presidency basically has been chopped up. Ian Johnson took on&#13;
the role of chair of the CGIAR. The Global Water Partnership I've handed over to Margaret&#13;
Catley-Carlson outside of the Bank; the CGAP, Nemat Shafik has taken on that responsibility.&#13;
And the culture unit has been taken over under the social development program with Gloria&#13;
Davis. So that's where all these various pieces got housed differently. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re scattered. The&#13;
only thing that was holding them together was really my own interest. I mean, there's no&#13;
particular logic of why the micro-finance should be linked with the water. It just happened that&#13;
I'm very interested in all of these topics. I was involved in launching many of them, and&#13;
therefore it happened.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In reading about the things that you've been involved in, I was taken with the inter-&#13;
faith dialogues. Where did that idea come from?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, it came from Jim. I mean, to be fair, Jim is really a visionary president&#13;
who's got wonderful ideas on a lot of things. Everything he has said since he's come to the&#13;
Bank--and I've told him this, and I say it in public--is music to my ears! I fully agree with&#13;
everything--his comprehensive development framework and the challenge of inclusion, to . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Preservation of cultural heritage and indigenous cultures.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: All of that! Yeah. I think he recognized we've got important groups to deal&#13;
with. Now, I have a history of dealing with that through the Friday Morning Group, and I don't&#13;
know if you've seen the little booklet on Reflections at the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, we have.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: And this was a long standing thing. For over 20 years now I've been holding&#13;
Friday morning meetings on spiritual values and development and inter-faith dialogue and so on.&#13;
So it's nothing new to me personally, and I felt somebody should do it because communities of&#13;
faith are not only usually heads of large networks of grassroots benevolent actionâ&#128;&#148;cutting debts&#13;
and all of thatâ&#128;&#148;well established, but theyâ&#128;&#153;re also important to leaders of moral authority,&#13;
networks of moral authority. And they are, again, our natural allies. I mean, these church-led&#13;
groups are the ones who are dealing with issues in terms of debt reduction, poverty reduction,&#13;
juvenile development, and therefore there is really no reason for us not to be involved with them&#13;
and understand where they're coming from.&#13;
&#13;
I have my own views on that, which I've expressed, have written in various parts. And, in fact,&#13;
                                    M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                           October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     25&#13;
&#13;
we have different perspectives. They come from a perspective where society is really a linkage&#13;
of solidarity and, therefore, when you see problematic issues it is a dearth of solidarity, and thus&#13;
exhortation, for example, is important. It's what has been called a "Mother Theresa model."&#13;
&#13;
Now, the problem we have is most people approach these questions with implicit models in the&#13;
back of their minds that are very different. There are three such models: The church groups and&#13;
so on really approach it very much with the issue of solidarity. There are others who see--World&#13;
Bank economists, predominantly--society as a web of transactions, and thus the issue is: there are&#13;
people who are excluded, marginalized and poor; how do you get them into the transaction. So&#13;
barriers to entry such as central structures, et cetera, regulatory framework, have worked where&#13;
the action is. The third, which tends to be the political activists who see society as a set of power&#13;
relations, and they're saying, "Well, we don't care what the rules of the game are. All we care&#13;
about is: how many women are getting elected; how many blacks are getting elected; how many&#13;
business people have a voice in the allocation of scarce resources.â&#128;? It's power that counts on the&#13;
allocation of scarce resources.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the reality is that, of course, society is all of these. It is not one or the other. People tend to&#13;
think in different facets because they haven't really confronted and held up mirrors to themselves&#13;
to see what is driving their set of recommendations, if they are really favoring an implicit model.&#13;
And thus a dialogue with these faith groups and the dialogue with political activists who are on&#13;
the power relation side, with most of the people in the Bank being on the transaction side, is a&#13;
very beneficial thing! And I think we saw some of that in the WDR 2000-2001 on poverty.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: In essence, when you get all those people together, you get a much richer&#13;
understanding of how to promote societal change, and this societal change, therefore, I think is to&#13;
the benefit of everybody. People who say, â&#128;&#156;Well, no, theyâ&#128;&#153;re not very analytical,â&#128;? and so on&#13;
miss the point! It is these complementary perspectives on social action, whether it's the activists&#13;
in the streets or the faith groups, either directly or the thinking of the very analytical people at the&#13;
World Bank on transactions--when you bring it together, then you have a much richer approach&#13;
of how to deal with it, and you build alliances.&#13;
&#13;
Building alliances is all about that. It's about understanding the other guy; it's about listening; it's&#13;
about seeing where they're coming from and not dismissing them. You shouldn't dismiss; you&#13;
should listen to what they have to say and try to understand them and then try to express your&#13;
own view in a certain way. And in so doing I think that we will shape our own views much&#13;
better.&#13;
&#13;
I've lived in the Bank for almost 30 years, and during that time I've seen the Bank go from a&#13;
place where people asked whether income distribution and poverty is something that isn't for us&#13;
to address to all the innovations that have been introduced. At the time we introduced rural&#13;
development and urban poverty, then population, health, nutrition, lending, environment, gender&#13;
                                        M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                              October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  26&#13;
&#13;
issues, structural adjustment, all of these issues, and now we are looking at the inclusion of&#13;
culture--all wonderful evolutions And I do not share the view that we should be trying to just&#13;
narrow it down to economics, because I think it's wrong. And I believe, in fact, we should&#13;
maintain this breadth for the Bank. It is one of the comparative advantages of the Bank, and it's&#13;
the only place where you can do this cross-sectoralyl and cross-country. And we should not lose&#13;
that comparative advantage by becoming a narrow focus group.&#13;
&#13;
So, I think this is a wonderful initiative that Jim has taken and is going on, and I understand that&#13;
Katherine Marshall has now been put in charge of it. But Joan Martin-Brown did a superb job in&#13;
handling that, and we did it on the side, largely. It was the kind of thing that was done on the&#13;
side, as are many other initiatives in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And piloting the Learning and Innovation Loans, the LILs, as they are called, is this&#13;
still on-going?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Yes, we used a lot of those during the launch of the culture program. The&#13;
LILs were launched, and they were, I thought, a good instrument, another great innovation to the&#13;
credit of Jim Wolfensohn.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, it's just about noon, and we want to talk about development issues. The first&#13;
question we have under development regards poverty alleviation, which has become the central&#13;
mission of the Bank. In your view, is the CDF [comprehensive development framework] the way&#13;
forward to achieving this goal?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, yes. It's certainly a very welcome development in the Bank, and I said&#13;
so to Jim from day one. One of my primary concerns is the selectivity of the Bank approach.&#13;
Contrary to most people who worry that we don't have enough selectivity, I think we have too&#13;
much selectivity in the Bank, and the CDF is a way of forcing people to remember that it's all&#13;
part of one hope. And I was one of the people instrumental in launching, with Pierre Landell-&#13;
Mills, the governance issue in the Bank when it was an unpopular thing in 1980s. We did it as&#13;
part of the long term perspective study for Africa, where the word "governance" was really put&#13;
into the mainstream of Bank work at the time. And it was important when you look at the&#13;
situation. Obviously whatever you are going to do in economics, you're going to do in&#13;
agriculture. If you have a Mobuto [Sese Seko] in Zaire, nothing is going to take off in that&#13;
country unless you have addressed these issues.&#13;
&#13;
Jim beautifully took on the issue of corruption, the "cancer of corruption" he called it, and this&#13;
was a wonderful idea. So the CDF is a good thing to remind people that these are the kinds of&#13;
things that you need to make sure happen in order to get the real action on the issues. By itself,&#13;
of course, it's not a safe prescription. It encourages people to think more holistically about these&#13;
issues, which is, of course, what my entire work has been about. It's been about expanding&#13;
thinking from narrow or sectoral views towards a holistic approach.&#13;
&#13;

                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 27&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: When one talks about governance or corruption, what about the problem of the Bank&#13;
running up against becoming involved in the politics of the countries it's dealing with?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I don't think so. I mean, I think we crossed that bridge way back there with&#13;
McNamara on that issue, and we said no. I mean, we should be concerned about the lower 40&#13;
percent. This is not about domestic politics; it's about development. In 1973, remember that is&#13;
where we were. Today these issues are important. I think as long as we define them accurately,&#13;
and I think we do very well on the governance issue where we say, â&#128;&#156;What is good governance?&#13;
What is required?â&#128;? Well, it requires enough transparency, accountability, a rule of law,&#13;
institutional pluralism, participation, free flow of information.&#13;
&#13;
Now, we haven't gotten around to telling people whether they should have a presidential or&#13;
parliamentary system, whether they should have a two-party or multi-party system, whether they&#13;
should have a bicameral or single chamber, whether they should have separation of powers or&#13;
not separation of powersâ&#128;&#148;any of that.&#13;
&#13;
I used to argue at the time in Africa, â&#128;&#156;We are spending firmly on our economic mandate.â&#128;? And I&#13;
made the case that if you do have these five or six characteristics of good governance that you&#13;
would have an effective investment climate, that you would have an effective flow of productive&#13;
goods and services being produced efficiently, that you would be maximizing your comparative&#13;
advantage. You can make a very compelling case from all of that.&#13;
&#13;
Now, de facto, yes, it does promote democracy, and it does promote human rights; it does&#13;
promote a lot of things. But you can define it in the same way. And in dealing with corruption,&#13;
transparency and accountability, and the rule of law are all very important parts of that. The&#13;
Bank has a long tradition in all its procurement practices going back ages that it should insist on&#13;
transparency, international competitive bidding, et cetera, which promotes much more effective,&#13;
you know, fighting of poverty, of corruption.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Does this involve the Bank in creating institutions of civil society in, say in Africa?&#13;
And how does the Bank go about doing that?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: What I'm fascinated by is all this enormous differentiation between the private&#13;
sector and civil society. A friend of mine in Africa told me, "What you guys have succeeded in&#13;
over the last ten years"--though it was about five years ago when he said that--"is that you turn&#13;
the private sector from being suspicious sharks to being respected investors." And this is part of&#13;
the same battle. Governments everywhere have now accepted the role of the private sector; they&#13;
are not yet ready to accept civil society. They are struggling with that concept.&#13;
&#13;
Now, we did not go around saying, "We have to set up the private sector ourselves." But we did&#13;
say that you can't rely on the government to run these institutions; they won't do it efficiently.&#13;
We want a competitive market, so we have to get this going.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                               28&#13;
&#13;
One of the things that has not served us well has also been the choices of words we've used, and&#13;
these words have not been helpful. I mean, I'll give you an example. In my speeches I've always&#13;
said, even while I was vice president of the World Bank--which used to surprise a lot of people--&#13;
that I want to abolish the word "free markets" from our vocabulary because what we want to talk&#13;
about are competitive markets. And if you think of Wall Street, which is one of the most&#13;
regulated markets in the world, you know that in order to get listed you have to submit financial&#13;
accounts and audited accounts and whatnot. If somebody buys five percent of the stock, it has to&#13;
be publicly announced. Insider trading is criminalized and prosecuted and pursued. You have a&#13;
whole Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that defines what brokers can and cannot do,&#13;
and the margin accounts they have to hold. You have an entire legal construct behind it that&#13;
enforces contract law. You have a bigger legal construct behind it that fights monopoly as in the&#13;
antitrust legislations written on Microsoft as we now see. I mean, who said that you don't want&#13;
governments involved!&#13;
&#13;
The big difference is that these are government interventions that are there to promote&#13;
competition, as opposed to "governs best that governs least, and we should have nothing to do&#13;
with it." And if you want to see free markets that are not regulated, that's what happened in&#13;
Albania, where we almost had a civil war. So our vocabulary sometimes doesn't help us, and it&#13;
leaves us with idiotic arguments about state versus market and so on. You can't have a market if&#13;
you don't have an effective state behind it, so I don't know why we're getting ourselves caught up&#13;
in, tied up in knots defending things that we shouldn't be defending. Yes, we don't want&#13;
governments to be in there trying to promote goods and services they're not very good at doing&#13;
or they're using actually all the arguments that are in fact against the interests of the poor.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, I think we can argue, and we have argued, that even in purest economic terms&#13;
there are things called "public goods," which by definition the private sector will not do. And&#13;
incidentally, Adam Smith in person, he of the invisible hand, defined that there would be certain&#13;
activities where the benefits of the public would be largely beyond the return to the single&#13;
individual and that therefore should be taken on by the state. And he uses an example:&#13;
education. People should read The Wealth of Nations, not simply hear about Adam Smith and&#13;
the invisible hand. He was much more thoughtful than many of his pseudo disciples!&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I have my students read this.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Yeah, itâ&#128;&#153;s a great book! Itâ&#128;&#153;s a wonderful book! I think Adam Smith and&#13;
[Nicholas de] Condorcet of the period are far better than . . .&#13;
&#13;
All these things I think we need to come back to and enrich our discourse in a way that all these&#13;
natural allies are emerging. And I used to do this very frequently with governments. I would&#13;
say, "I'm not here to negotiate against you. You've got a problem; I'm here to help you solve it.&#13;
I'm here as your economic advisor and as your social development advisor. Let's agree. You&#13;
have a problem with your debt, with your fiscal deficit. This is what youâ&#128;&#153;re proposing. This is&#13;
how much money we can get. You think itâ&#128;&#153;s enough? Is it going to solve the problem? If itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                              29&#13;
&#13;
not going to solve the problem, then we have to do something more. Not for me. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not&#13;
insisting on pushing you to cut more spending. But these are your own figures, and letâ&#128;&#153;s see.&#13;
Where are you going and how? Is this going to take you out or not?â&#128;? You see, itâ&#128;&#153;s not the&#13;
confrontational issue. You build relationships with them. Iâ&#128;&#153;m trying to say, â&#128;&#156;What youâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
proposing is not enough to solve your problem. You know you have to cut deeper. You have to&#13;
increase revenues.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
I told one of them, "It's not ideology; it is arithmetic. If you're spending so much and you're&#13;
receiving so much, you've got only three ways--and three ways only--of bridging that gap.&#13;
You're either going to print money, which means there will be hyper-inflation, or you're going to&#13;
borrow (and you've already borrowed to the point where you can't even pay the interest on your&#13;
debt, so you can't borrow any more) or you're going to increase revenues and cut cost. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
cleared one; weâ&#128;&#153;ve cleared two; we now are number three. So let's sit down and discuss together&#13;
how we're going to do it. And I'm here to help you."&#13;
&#13;
And I think, in the same way, when we start discussing these things, we get out of many of these&#13;
debates on why we're proposing this and so on, because we start a problem, say, â&#128;&#156;Is this a&#13;
problem? Do you recognize you have a problem here?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;No.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Number of poor people, number of people not going to school, number . . .?â&#128;? And, of course,&#13;
all governments want to have more people in school and so on. â&#128;&#156;Okay, then letâ&#128;&#153;s see how weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
going to get it solved.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And I think that you can build very good relationships and build alliances with people by&#13;
avoiding some of the heavily laden words that really do not convey the full richness of what we&#13;
are all about!&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Would you say, then, that's one of the achievements of the CDF, that it has changed&#13;
the vocabulary, changed the discussion?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: In part, yes, but not yet enough.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What about within the Bank? Have the staff in the Bank bought into the CDF?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I'm not really the best person to discuss this because for the last six or&#13;
seven months I have been out of touch. So, I would say, however, that they were beginning to&#13;
buy into it. Some of the staff were very eager and supportive of it. Others were skeptical, but&#13;
these are the same staff who would be skeptical of accepting my invitation when I got promoted&#13;
and who said, "Yeah, well, it's true, what he says is true, but at the same time we know how the&#13;
system really works!" These kind of guys are always going to be there.&#13;

&#13;
When I was proposing this issue of culture and somebody told me, "You know that's just a foible&#13;
of the president. And why should we do it, because it takes away from our mainstream activity?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Yeah? Like what is our mainstream activity?"&#13;
&#13;
"Operating the environment, women, et cetera."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, you know what? I remember the day when every one of those was considered the&#13;
foible of the president!" It was McNamara on poverty. [Laughter] Every president had taken on&#13;
these issues such as health, population, et cetera, which always were at some point seen as some&#13;
frivolous add-on. In the end, if it was left to the staff of those days, they would never have&#13;
allowed any of those activities to take place! It was only because presidents were empowered&#13;
statutorily and by their position had the sense of vision to take the lead in the institution to get&#13;
the endorsement of the Board to pursue it. They are the ones who make paradigms evolve, and&#13;
those of us who are committed to make that evolve work with them on their things and we make&#13;
it happen. And I think this is how a lot of these things have happened.&#13;
&#13;
I think, therefore, thereâ&#128;&#153;s a process by which we produce a change in the institution. And it takes&#13;
time before it becomes adopted as mainstream. The CDF is well on its way, but it's not there yet.&#13;
It's going to happen and will happen. I think Jim has done a lot for the Bank. In fact, I was&#13;
telling him recently you only have to look at the Innovation Market Place. This is needed. It is a&#13;
very different Bank, and it is good.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: One of the commentaries about globalization of the fast-moving private capital is&#13;
that it undermines the authority of governments, that it makes the global marketplace much more&#13;
powerful, and that one of the real risks of globalization is--as opposed to the SEC controlling&#13;
capital markets in the United Statesâ&#128;&#148;that there isn't really an adequate control internationally of&#13;
capital.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I have a very unpopular position, which is that I happen to agree that&#13;
the current cowboy capitalism of the nineteenth century that is present in the international scene&#13;
should cease. I think that we're beginning to witness the end of a peculiar period of&#13;
triumphalism that occurred between '89 after the collapse of the Eastern bloc countries and '98&#13;
when the East Asian crisis really broke. People say, "Oh, no, who governs best governs least.&#13;
And let's get out of the way of markets. Markets will solve everything from adult education to&#13;
the environment and so on," ignoring the wise thoughts about what is the difference between&#13;
public goods, and precise economic terms which are nonviable, lead us to a situation.&#13;
&#13;
Every one of the capitalist countries, starting with the United States, Japan, Europe, so on, have&#13;
in their own capital markets instituted certain controls. And they have in their own capital&#13;
markets found that they needed to evolve those controls over time. The last legal act in the&#13;
United States which was repealed, et cetera, was old examples of evolutionary thinking.&#13;
&#13;
                                     M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  31&#13;
&#13;
So the time has come that we should, in fact, look at the international capital markets. They look&#13;
to becoming important. They're no longer marginal; theyâ&#128;&#153;re no longer secondary, no longer&#13;
residual. They're huge! Capital transactions today account for 1.5 trillion dollars a day. That's&#13;
enough to buy and sell the U.S. GNP in a week. And we should be very thoughtful about how to&#13;
make this situation less qualified, more anchored into reality. I've written about that.&#13;
&#13;
I happen to believe in the very unpopular token tax or equivalent thereof. I think we should do&#13;
things like that, and I don't buy the nonsensical arguments that "Oh, we can't do this. It's not&#13;
doable." If we can have a small robot moving in quasi-real time on Mars, we sure as hell can use&#13;
basic computers where every single transaction is done by computers. You won't be able to find&#13;
ways of organizing that if there was a political risk behind it.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, practically every other argument which is leveled at some sort of mechanism, same&#13;
sort of argument we used to get about income taxes: "Well, some people are going to cheat."&#13;
Yeah, that's true, but so what? The majority of people have to pay income taxes, and it's being&#13;
used for transfer of payment in society. And it does result in significant reductions in poverty.&#13;
And there are a number of other examples of that kind. So I think that we need to overcome that&#13;
fear and get much more thoughtful, recognizing the enormous size of these capital markets.&#13;
&#13;
And what we are witnessing right now is also a rebellion against other aspects of globalization&#13;
that involve homogenization, loss of cultural identity, et cetera, and these do require our&#13;
attention. In many ways we are reliving the nonsensical debate which we had. Today, nobody&#13;
would agree differently about the social dimensions of adjustment back in the â&#128;&#152;80s when&#13;
UNICEF was an adjustment with a human face. When I and some other colleagues in the Bank&#13;
working on social dimensions of adjustment programs in Africa were addressing these issues,&#13;
and a lot of people were saying, "Well, you know, adjustment is about getting the macro&#13;
fundamentals right and so on." Yes, it is, but it's also about a lot of other things: about insuring&#13;
who pays the burden and who carries the cost of the adjustment and whether or not you are&#13;
promoting the well-being of people or not and not forgetting that the economy exists there only&#13;
for the purposes of the well-being of people. It's not an end within itself.&#13;
&#13;
Today, nobody would argue about poverty reduction and economic growth not going together.&#13;
Back in the â&#128;&#152;70s with McNamara that was a big argument. Today, nobody would argue that&#13;
environmental protection is against economic growth, because they've seen the costs of not&#13;
attending to that. Coming back afterwards and undoing is ten times more expensive than&#13;
preventing it in the beginning. The Chinese are now discovering this, and others are discovering&#13;
this.&#13;
&#13;
So in the same way I think people who are so laissez faire on these issues are meant to recognize&#13;
that thus we need to go back again; it's not a free market, it's a competitive market. In the same&#13;
way we're going to have to think in terms of what is the mechanism with which you tame the&#13;
wild markets of the national capital flows and ensure that some of the new information and&#13;
communication technologies that are out there are, in fact, used because they have the potential&#13;

&#13;
not only to increase the equalities between people but in fact to provide the means for the&#13;
marginalized to express themselves, which is an enormous potential that requires imagination.&#13;
And it requires reaching out to do this.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What role does the Bank have in humanizing the impact of globalization?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I think, for example, in the East Asian crisis, I thought and argued, and I&#13;
think Jim very much saw it in the same light as some of the senior managers, that if you look at&#13;
the East Asia crisis, what is the role of the Bank vis-Ã -vis the Fund? If the Fundâ&#128;&#153;s role is&#13;
primarily to stabilize the situation and ensure the hemorrhaging stops, the Bank's role is two-&#13;
fold: to ensure that it's not the poor who suddenly bear proof of whiplash of that event and,&#13;
secondly, that it does not result in the entire sale of national assets to a bunch of Western shark! I&#13;
think those are very important functions. I think the Bank will take on those functions in taming&#13;
the wild markets, so to speak. Then the IMF role and the Bank's role become very&#13;
complementary. But it requires a way of thinking--or it should be a way of intervention--that is&#13;
not that we're here to do micro adjustment; we're here to ensure that micro adjustments that are&#13;
done are done in such a way that it's not the poor who bear the brunt of it, because if you look at&#13;
Indonesia, for example, about 40,000,000 people are just above the poverty line. The question is&#13;
whether the result of the adjustment would be 15,000,000 or 35,000,000 of those falling below&#13;
the poverty line. And this is where the Bank's role in humanizing the impacts of globalization&#13;
becomes important.&#13;
&#13;
I think Jim, for example, has shown enormous leadership in saying, "Yes, we do have a debt&#13;
problem, and letâ&#128;&#153;s have something called HIPC [heavily indebted poor countries]." The first&#13;
time it was announced it was leaked to the press and postponed by a year. And so, I think in the&#13;
same way the Bank will have a role to play and to say, "Yes, we have to humanize globalization,&#13;
tame the wild markets, ensure less volatility, and find a way of working with governments and&#13;
with others in order to make this happen.â&#128;? I think in so doing we will be true to our mandate,&#13;
which is economic development and poverty reduction. And it would be very good.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The role of the Bank in helping to strap or restrain these markets, it seems to me, is&#13;
what Joseph Stiglitz was talking about.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Yeah, and I agree with him.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Do you think the Bank should have been more forceful in making the case that&#13;
Stiglitz was trying to make, which was that internationally there had to be some restraints on, at&#13;
least the short term, volatile capital flows?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Yeah, I think there is that, but there is also the fact that--and again, this is&#13;
where I think it is our natural allies; I'm talking about the NGOs--the fact is, of course, that there&#13;
is a view which is largely dominated by the G-7 in both the IMF and World Bank as to what&#13;
these institutions should do. And I think the Bank can only go so far in taking that position, but I&#13;

&#13;
think, yes, Joe was right. I think we should speak out. We have a responsibility to speak out.&#13;
And if it does create a situation where we have disagreements, then by all means let's thrash&#13;
them out.&#13;
&#13;
This is not the first time it has happened. I think, again looking back at the â&#128;&#152;80s when we were&#13;
looking at this, the IMF still looked at the structural adjustment issues in Africa as being very&#13;
short term liquidity problems. We in the Bank said, "These are long term problems." And we&#13;
were arguing with each other over time while the poor countries were being sort of torn apart.&#13;
We would come in and say, "Increase the prices to farmers so that you get the supply response."&#13;
But if you did that, because most of the revenue came from the difference from what they paid&#13;
farmers and what the price of cocoa and coffee was in West Africa. Then their deficit increased,&#13;
and the IMF said, "Don't you dare increase the prices to farmers." [Laughter] And so the poor&#13;
government said, â&#128;&#156;What was going on?â&#128;? Well, there was a lot of fighting going on, and in the&#13;
end of it we settled on creating this policy framework paper. The IMF wanted a one-year&#13;
framework, we wanted a five-year, and we settled on a three-year framework. It was wonderful&#13;
because at least we got to the more sensible discussions of the real economy and the monetary&#13;
side; we got the two together. The government and the two agencies would agree on a program;&#13;
it took a lot of fighting on these programs, but that was okay! We should have the same thing&#13;
happening again.&#13;
&#13;
These policy frameworks papers were really for the IDA of the poorest countries. But now we&#13;
need to think in terms of the bigger capital flows, and we'll have other fights like we used to have&#13;
before. But so what! I mean, that's how things evolve.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: The Bank embarked on a new vision in '96 to become a knowledge bank, and to that&#13;
end has launched a number of global knowledge initiatives. How does the Bank have to change&#13;
its approach to development because of the information and communication technology&#13;
revolution, or does it?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I think we're doing very well. We already are doing extremely well in this&#13;
area. I think the much more systematic structure of the architecture of our knowledge,&#13;
availability of best practice, the generation of communities of practice are all extremely good&#13;
issues. I think that attention has been paid to connectivity in Africa in particular. The notion of&#13;
participating in such things as the virtual university, distance learning, WBI [World Bank&#13;
Institute] initiatives in this area, all of these are very good things, and I think weâ&#128;&#153;re doing very&#13;
well. I think people were unreasonable in their expectations of how quickly certain things could&#13;
be done or how much they would cost. But by and large, I would say the Bank is moving quite&#13;
well in this area.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay, great. Thank you so much for this first session.&#13;

&#13;
BECKER: It's October 26th, and this is the second half of our interview with Mr. Serageldin.&#13;
We'd like to continue talking about development issues this morning. And the first question we&#13;
have is: what do you think the Bank still needs to do in regard to its thinking or philosophy on&#13;
development as it embarks on this new path of stressing client ownership policy and programs,&#13;
and the need for greater interaction with civil society, which you have talked about, and also the&#13;
simplification and flexibility in its lending conditions?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I think that in this instance what the Bank needs to do is just more of the&#13;
same of what it's doing. I think we're doing very well in better listening and better&#13;
understanding, more openness to new ideas, but there is still a significant gap between the public&#13;
position and the actual performance at the grassroots level. That doesn't bother me; that always&#13;
should be the case.&#13;
&#13;
Throughout my career in the Bank, I was always a very outspoken defender of the Bank in many&#13;
international fora. And somebody would tell me, "But you know, what you're saying and your&#13;
analytical work is not what the average staff member in the Bank is doing."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Of course! It would be a disaster if it were. Part of my job as a leader in the Bank is to&#13;
push the envelope. What you have to see is not the difference between where I am and where&#13;
they are but to see where we were three years ago and where we are three years later. What I'm&#13;
saying now is what they will be doing three years later, at which time I'd be saying something&#13;
else."&#13;
&#13;
Now really Jim Wolfensohn is exactly in that position. He is pushing the institution. And that's&#13;
Jim's rhetoric and his vision and so on; he is ahead of the institution. And that's what leadership&#13;
is all about. That's what he should be doing. So there is a gap, and there's a gap that should be&#13;
there.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I have frequently told people I have this amoeba model of leadership which isâ&#128;&#148;you know,&#13;
an amoeba has a kind of like a leg, boot pushes out, so it goes far and then the rest of the body&#13;
flows into it and moves into the new position. Now, the real danger is that if the leg pulls too far&#13;
out, it can pop out and leave the main body behind. And there's a gap between them. So you've&#13;
got to be pushing the envelope by pushing it at a pace which allows the rest of the body to flow&#13;
in and fill the space that you've gone, not to reach so far out that you actually get cut off from the&#13;
rest of the body and it doesn't flow with it. A flow-in would be sometimes with complaining,&#13;
sometimes willy-nilly, sometimes with some people fighting a rear guard action against it, but&#13;
ultimately the institution flows.&#13;
&#13;
And I think this is the question with a vision leader like Jim Wolfensohn. The question is&#13;
                                       M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;

&#13;
whether he's going too fast for the rest of the institution. But I think, on balance, we're moving&#13;
in the right direction. On balance, all the things that are being said are exactly what should be&#13;
done. And I think, therefore, the real issue is to ensure systematic quality control in our&#13;
operations, making sure that we build in the mechanisms of peer review, of systematic review, of&#13;
ensuring that our partnerships and so on are more than just words, because if we don't, then we&#13;
are at risk of having our partners in the countries and in the international community gradually&#13;
turn sour at the end and say, "Well, these are nice words, but nothing's happening." And you lose&#13;
credibility in that case. And this is where I think we have to watch that gap between rhetoric and&#13;
reality. There has to be a gap. If there isn't, it's a disaster. It means that the leaders are not&#13;
pushing the institution anymore.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: There's no new thinking.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: That's right. It has to be not just new thinking, because you can have a lot of&#13;
new thinking going on in the institution, bubbling with ideas, and it was always like that.&#13;
&#13;
Believe it or not, the famous memo that Larry [Lawrence H.] Summers had written about&#13;
dumping toxic waste in Africa, that had been leaked to the press. I was traveling--I was then&#13;
dealing with environment--and I arrived in, of all places, the nether land of Scandinavia where&#13;
this was a very big issue. And I defended it. And I still do. I said, "Look, this was a personal&#13;
memorandum inside the Bank, and I believe that it should not have been leaked, and that part of&#13;
the Bank is to allow professional debates and all ideas should be accepted. No idea should be&#13;
too wild or too outrageous to be presented." I said, "Now, you guys are too outraged by the ideas&#13;
in that memorandum? Well, a lot of things that I write which you like outraged a lot of&#13;
economists! When I dismiss many of their measurements as inadequate and so on and so forth,&#13;
when I talk about cultural dimensions of development and things like that, they don't like that!&#13;
So the Bank should allow this to happen." And so that's different; that's a lot of bubbling of ideas&#13;
and so on.&#13;
&#13;
What I'm talking about is once ideas have been adopted and jelled by the leadership, now these&#13;
ideas are of course pushing the Bank in new directions. There should be a gap between what the&#13;
Bank is doing today and what the leadership is saying we should do. And that's how we all&#13;
move! And that gap should exist, but how big it should be is the real issue. If it becomes too&#13;
wide or if there's no real cooperation, then we have a serious problem. And I think, therefore, it's&#13;
a matter of ensuring systematic mechanisms of compliance, of pursuing the new ideas, of staff&#13;
motivation--all of these issues which are deeply important.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Another issue that has become very much an emotive one is the question of debt&#13;
relief. In addition to the HIPC approach, what else can the Bank do?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I think what the Bank has done, continues to do, what should be more of or&#13;
simply to continue, to be outspoken in its need to simplify HIPC procedures and simplify the&#13;
hoops through which countries have to jump in order to become eligible and accelerate the pace&#13;

&#13;
by which it can be done. And, again, I think the leadership of the Bank has done a lot in this&#13;
area. It's beginning to settle into a lot of the critics outside. It's not really the Bank that is&#13;
holding back but the G-7. And itâ&#128;&#153;s beginning now to filter through. And that, I think, will&#13;
happen more in the future. But I think the ideas are right.&#13;
&#13;
I personally have a different view on something else. I believe we should be setting up a fund of&#13;
grant money for those who are not heavily indebted, because I think there is a real issue here. If&#13;
you have poor countries, many of them in Africa--I worked in Africa for many yearsâ&#128;&#148;who have&#13;
mismanaged their economies and have fallen deeply into debt, okay, it's fair enough that we&#13;
should try and help them out. But what about those who managed their economies properly,&#13;
tightened their belts, and did not fall into debt? They get nothing! And it is unfair. I'm thinking&#13;
specifically of Cape Verde, for example. This country was very cautious on borrowing, always&#13;
maintained six months of import reserves, cover six months of imports, would not accept any&#13;
indebtedness that was more than IDA terms, and they really managed their economy extremely&#13;
well. Now, do they get penalized for their prudent behavior and very sensible management? I&#13;
believe, therefore, we should, in reviewing these single cases, say, "These countries tried, and&#13;
theyâ&#128;&#153;re trying to put some order into their house and so on." We should also be assisting those&#13;
very poor countries who did not fall into debt as a way of recognizing that good management&#13;
does deserve recognition by the international community, not just good intentions today to fix&#13;
bad management of the past--which is what everybody's talking about--but also that systematic&#13;
good management over the years deserves special attention and recognition.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How does the Bank deal with aid fatigue, ODA [official development assistance]?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I think we should continue to be very forceful defenders of the need for&#13;
more ODA. But I believe that the credibility of ODA has been tarnished by a lot of problems&#13;
with bilateral aid and a lack of clarity in the minds of the public. In those instances, the Bank&#13;
should be making a claim that it is not just more of the same--more of the past--that we are a new&#13;
paradigm. We're behaving in a new way. When people used to tell me, "But what does this&#13;
mean? Does it mean that you were wrong in the past and now?" It doesn't mean we were wrong.&#13;
For example, if you go to a doctor to get a treatment today, it would be very different from the&#13;
same disease you got 25 years ago. Doesn't mean the doctor was a quack 25 years ago. It means&#13;
that our knowledge and our science has progressed. It would be a disaster if it didn't! And so,&#13;
yes, what we're doing now is different from what we did in the past, but the professionalism of&#13;
the institution is not impugned. What you have is, basically, are we doing the best that we know&#13;
how to do today? And today is different from what it was yesterday, and tomorrow will be&#13;
different. Ten years from now, we'll be saying, "God, can you imagine how naive we were in the&#13;
year 2000? They were saying we can do this and that and so on! Now we know we really&#13;
should focus on these issues," in the same way that we're saying, "Can you imagine how naive&#13;
these people were in the early â&#128;&#152;80s when they were focusing on macroeconomic conditionality&#13;
and weren't thinking of governance issues?"&#13;
&#13;
These are things which we--the institutional dimensions coming into focus, bringing in a lot of&#13;
                                      M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                            October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 37&#13;
&#13;
these issues of cultural identity, what brings people together, the glue that holds societies&#13;
together, understanding the importance of that, which was factored out of analysis back in the&#13;
â&#128;&#152;80s and the early â&#128;&#152;90s. I think this is part of the evolution of thinking. Now, if we manage to&#13;
convey that in the same way that advances in medicine or science are not greeted by a derision of&#13;
past sciences but as an example of progress, that's the image we have to project. And we&#13;
shouldn't allow critics to try to define us into a position that says, "Admit that you were wrong in&#13;
the past and stand there and say â&#128;&#152;Mea Culpa!â&#128;&#153;" Not at all! We are representing the best thinking&#13;
in the world today. I challenge people on these points.&#13;
&#13;
Then look at the past--yes, we were also the best thinkers In the past then. It's very easy with the&#13;
20-20 vision of hindsight to say, "How come this wasn't done?" The question ought to be, â&#128;&#156;What&#13;
was being said then?â&#128;? And this is where the evolution of thinking goes. Now, somebody can&#13;
say, "Well, professor so and so in such a university said that at a time when we were ignoring&#13;
them." Yes, but the Bank is a collective of 182 countries and it has a responsibility for&#13;
mainstream thinking. And at the time it was still a minority position that gradually evolved.&#13;
&#13;
And we should be willing to take strong positions on things that we are convinced about. We did&#13;
fund, for example, privatization, private sectors and so on. We learned over the years that&#13;
privatization should not be done under any conditions. It should be done under certain conditions&#13;
where it doesn't turn into a Mafia-type operation, but we were right in the general tendency to&#13;
think that the governments couldn't do it all. And it was unpopular at the time to take these&#13;
positions, and now it's widely accepted.&#13;
&#13;
So, there's evolution in the thinking globally, nationally, regionally, and the Bank should not be&#13;
ashamed of that evolution. In fact, by successfully conveying the image of this evolution in&#13;
thinking, far from appearing fickle, we should be giving a much stronger support to those who&#13;
wanted to increase ODA.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, let me turn to another question which quotes one of these professors. And&#13;
it's critics such as Jeffery Sachs, who say that the Bank is no longer relevant, that development&#13;
should be carried on through concessional lending only. How do you answer such criticism&#13;
about the Bank's relevance, especially in light of the recent decline in the Bank's traditional&#13;
lending and an increase in its advisory services?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I think there's some element of truth, although of course Jeffery Sachs&#13;
has hip-hopped more than most on most issues.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: He hasnâ&#128;&#153;t the greatest record.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: He doesn't have the greatest record himself. I recall very well when he was&#13;
telling us how we are going to teach you guys how to do work in Africa and how to get the&#13;
prices right.&#13;
&#13;
                                     M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   38&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, the question now is: should the Bank be doing more concessional lending? Definitely.&#13;
I think certainly if we could have more IDA, that would be great.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I think the Bank should be doing more concessional aid, and that requires&#13;
more IDA. But I think it's true that, of course, there are now private capital flows willing to go,&#13;
but theyâ&#128;&#153;re not willing to go necessarily in the same companies where they're needed. I mean,&#13;
there's very little capital flows going to some of the African countries and some of the others.&#13;
&#13;
I do not accept the notion of triage, which is, â&#128;&#156;Well, let some sufferâ&#128;? and so on. It is true that at&#13;
some points there will be nothing you can do in a particular country except humanitarian&#13;
assistance. But in most instances the business of development is about working in very tough&#13;
conditions, and the best performers are those who need our help least. Our ability to work&#13;
ourselves out of a job would be the greatest contribution we can make. I remember when I used&#13;
to work in Greece, Spain and Ireland and so on. [Laughter] Theyâ&#128;&#153;re all countries which, of&#13;
course, went on to graduate. So I think that there is something to that, that the greater focus&#13;
should be on assistance to the poorest countries which require, therefore, concessional assistance,&#13;
but also there's a public goods dimension that private sector money will not tackle, and therefore&#13;
we should be available to help in someplace.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Turning again briefly to globalization, what is the effect of globalization on Bank&#13;
coordination with other organizations such as the IMF?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: IMF coordination with the Bank continues and will continue. When you talk&#13;
about partnerships in the Bank, itâ&#128;&#153;s really not true. The only real partner we have is the IMF, by&#13;
that I mean where you have a commitment and where you believe that you must work with them&#13;
as a partner and where you believe that you both really bring something to the solution and&#13;
where you're not willing to walk away because you're having a fight. This is the only one of the&#13;
institutions where, at the staff level as opposed to the leadership level, there's real understanding;&#13;
it is a marriage,; itâ&#128;&#153;s a Catholic marriage; we canâ&#128;&#153;t divorce. We can't walk away; we have to&#13;
work it out. And in that sense we have a strong partnership with IMF.&#13;
&#13;
Redefinition of roles is inevitable. The Bank went from being a lender of last resort and an&#13;
institution that would really do very select projects here and there into a real development agency&#13;
over a forty year period. And today, with globalization and all manifestations of the revolution&#13;
in information and communications technology, the revolution in capital flows, the private sector&#13;
growth, the emergence of civil society, roles and relationships are going to have to be redefined.&#13;
They have been in the past; they will be again in the future; they are being now.&#13;
&#13;
So I don't think there's anything particular in what we term "globalization." It is not really very&#13;
different from a lot of things that happened before. I should read you one of my quotes from&#13;
Karl Marxâ&#128;&#148;a vice president of the World Bank quoting from Karl Marx! But it's a beautiful&#13;

&#13;
quote, and youâ&#128;&#153;d swear he was talking about todayâ&#128;&#153;s globalization. It is where he was talking&#13;
about the industrial revolution. And so changes of that magnitude are not abnormal. They're not&#13;
totally out of line. We just happen to be feeling them, and as a result we're trying to cope with&#13;
them and coping with the negative aspects that emerge with it.&#13;
&#13;
The industrial revolution had its luddites who were trying to oppose and stop the machines and&#13;
the progress and so on, which is the same as some people today reacting viscerally against all of&#13;
the global currents. But they are unstoppable. The question is: are we going to repeat the&#13;
mistakes of the past, which were that we went through the industrial revolution first in the&#13;
economic transformation and then we caught up with the social side of it. I mean, the nineteenth&#13;
century was all about economics, accepting huge human costs--absolutely huge human costs.&#13;
Remember Charles Dickens' stories about child labor. Now people forget that the first child&#13;
labor act was sponsored by whom? By the society for the protection of animals, who said, "If we&#13;
can have laws to protect against cruelty to animals, we should be able to protect against cruelty&#13;
to children!" And this was in the nineteenth century in London. It was a question of child labor,&#13;
child abuse and so on. Children were considered totally economic goods that belonged to their&#13;
parents in those days.&#13;
&#13;
After that there was the creation of the middle class which emerged in the twentieth century, the&#13;
welfare state and so on. Now today we're witnessing again a new burst: enormous wealth for&#13;
some individuals, gaps that are growing, disparities, much more fierce competition reemerging&#13;
again. And it's all for the good on one side. The question is now: do we really have to go&#13;
through the same--first you've got to do the economic, then we'll catch up on the social--or have&#13;
we learned enough from the past that there really is no reason to impose that enormous agony on&#13;
human beings and that, in fact, we can balance the two much more thoughtfully than we've done&#13;
before.&#13;
&#13;
Recall the history of the Bank: redistribution with growth rather than for growth. Today,&#13;
nobody is going to argue that poverty reduction and economic growth are mutually incompatible&#13;
or that environmental protection and economic growth are mutually incompatible. In the same&#13;
way, therefore, we should be finding ways to deal with the new economy and new international&#13;
flows in ways that bring in some of the regulations at the international level that countries have&#13;
imposed at the national level--we talked about that in terms of competitive markets rather than&#13;
free markets and so on--and begin to bring some of the taming of the wild markets with the&#13;
social concerns that are there. And when you do that, then that you generate, I think, the&#13;
alliances of the caring that we really need to launch. I think it is a feasible political program in&#13;
which the Bank would be a lead player. But it's not easy. And we shall be criticized. I said that&#13;
to my colleagues in my farewell speech, "You shall be criticized--so what!" It's a tribute to the&#13;
importance of the institution.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What about relations with the UN?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: The relations with the UN I think need to improve. I think they have improved&#13;

&#13;
already a lot under Jim Wolfensohn.&#13;
&#13;
I recall some years ago when Secretary-General Butros Butros Ghali, a good personal friend,&#13;
asked for assistance on a strategy for development. He had put out an agenda for peace in the&#13;
UN strategy for development. I spoke to some of my colleagues in the vice presidencies, and&#13;
they were so dismissive of the UN it was insulting. Somebody said, "Well, you send them the&#13;
WDRs to read.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
I said, â&#128;&#156;This is not a sensible reaction at all!â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
As you know, the secretary-general of the UN has a position of enormous moral authority, and if&#13;
he falls short in getting advice on developmental issues, the World Bank should be rushing to&#13;
provide that advice, not holding back.&#13;
&#13;
In that sense, there was an image which is now, of course, past, but at some point, when Mark&#13;
Malloch Brown first came to the Bank to lead our External Affairs Department, he was&#13;
concerned about whether the Bank should differentiate itself from the UN or link up with it. And&#13;
this issue was very much at heart because the UN had a bad name among many conservatives in&#13;
the U.S. and elsewhere, and whether the Bank should get closer or not--I think we need to get&#13;
closer.&#13;
&#13;
I think the example that we're seeing with our work on the CGIAR with the FAO [UN Food and&#13;
Agriculture Organization] and the UNDP [United Nations Development Program], with our&#13;
collaboration with WHO [World Health Organization] and on matters pertaining to the vaccine&#13;
initiative, our closer collaboration with UNESCO on a number of areas, now and again launching&#13;
with ILO on youth employment, all of these are good examples of where the Bank should strive&#13;
for new partnerships. I'm using the word "partnership," but in fact these are more sort of&#13;
administrative collaborations. As I said before, the only really strong partnership is, at present,&#13;
sill the IMF, the one that permeates the whole institution. We need to get the rest of the UN&#13;
system to be linked up in the same way.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Should there be someone at the highest level whose responsibility it is to continue to&#13;
work with the UN and other organizations?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: No. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think it's really somebody at the highest level. What you need is to&#13;
make arrangements for collaboration at the staff and middle management level. And here is&#13;
where you run into obstacles between the two philosophies. A philosophy which has gained a lot&#13;
of currency in the Bank lately is sort of devolution down to the lowest common denominator.&#13;
And that is not a help to development, I think, because what you end up with is that for the&#13;
individual task manager, what they do is their entire lives they donâ&#128;&#153;t see the big picture. They&#13;
canâ&#128;&#153;t see the big picture or they canâ&#128;&#153;t be a task manager. They are managing a tack. And for&#13;
them it may be, for example, more convenient to simply hire a consultant rather than work with&#13;
somebody out of their field. And it's easier, less cumbersome bureaucratically. Consultants are&#13;

&#13;
available and so on. But the net result is that, in fact, you hire a consultant or you hire somebody&#13;
from inside the Bank, a colleague from inside the Bank. But the net result of that is there is an&#13;
institutional dimension. You're not using Bank staff; you are using consultants who come in and&#13;
out, you don't get institutional memory, you don't develop institutional expertise, which you&#13;
should have. Out-sourcing is for more discreet tasks but not for knowledge of the Bank. And, in&#13;
the same way, if you choose the convenience, you're losing the possibility of really&#13;
systematically collaborating with colleagues in UN agencies.&#13;
&#13;
And I don't think that it is a matter of simply saying that some senior person should be in charge.&#13;
I think what we have to do is to find mechanisms. For example, one of the mechanisms is to take&#13;
budgetary chunks and buy time from some of our colleagues in the UN agencies and arrange for&#13;
these country programs, which we have one with FAO, to be able to pick expertise from across&#13;
the agency there and integrate them into operations with us. This is outside the budget controlled&#13;
staff. So it's provided, in a sense, for the staff as almost a free good, so you will get some of&#13;
these issues.&#13;
&#13;
Another one is really to raise the chunkiness of the budget to a higher level so that you don't&#13;
delegate everything down for everybody. People who are outside of the Bank can't imagine that&#13;
you can't find $20,000 to do something here. "Well, what do you mean? You've got a budget of&#13;
1.4 billion dollars, and you can't find funds?" Well, yeah, you can't, because outside certain&#13;
contingencies, everything is really given out, parceled out into tiny, tiny, tiny pieces, and it&#13;
becomes very difficult. If you keep a bigger chunk, you can keep the budget of the unit in bigger&#13;
chunks, youâ&#128;&#153;ll be able to do a lot more, and you would remove the time constraint of staff and&#13;
transaction costs of people buying and contracting with each other. I mean, thatâ&#128;&#153;s an enormous&#13;
amount of time that is being spent on administrative exchanges among staff inside the Bank,&#13;
instead of which they could be having intellectual exchanges with their peers in FAO, WHO,&#13;
UNESCO, UNDP, et cetera, as well as with the private sector and with NGOs. In a sense,&#13;
building these alliances at that level is more important than designating your vice president in&#13;
charge of UN relations or whatever.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What you're basically saying is keeping the budget at the level of the big picture?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Yeah, in large part I do believe so. I believe also that all this internal&#13;
transacting is a way--not only that it is enormously costly transactions, it's de-motivating for a&#13;
large number of staff. It also has to create stupid alternatives to good management in the sense&#13;
of saying, "We let the market speak." What do you mean, market speak? If I am a manager, I&#13;
should know who is a good staff member and who isn't. I shouldn't have to rely on whether&#13;
other people happen to like that individual or not. In fact, some of the best people I've worked&#13;
with have been pretty abrasive people, who are not particularly nice! But they were good!&#13;
&#13;
And I learned that lesson from my first division chief when I joined the Bank, who asked me to&#13;
review something, and I reviewed it. He said, â&#128;&#156;What do you think of this?â&#128;?&#13;

&#13;
I said, â&#128;&#156;It's excellent.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Yeah, that abrasive S.O.B. is really good!"&#13;
&#13;
And I thought, â&#128;&#156;This is a very important point. This is not a popularity contest.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Now, part of the quality of the work has got to be also how you deal with the client, but there are&#13;
people who are technical experts in certain fields, and you want their technical expertise. Itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
like you wantâ&#128;&#148;there is something in it for a doctor to have a bedside manner, but when youâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
going for brain surgery, you really want the very best brain surgeon! You donâ&#128;&#153;t care how cold or&#13;
abrasive they are! [Laughter] You want the very best! I think we absolutely need to get down to&#13;
this thing. We need to get away from this business that we have to trust just the geographic&#13;
departments to do anything.&#13;
&#13;
I have maintained that we are losing the quality of our staff by moving toward generalists in&#13;
many disciplines, and mostly economists. Look at the new hires over time. The net result of that&#13;
is that we are losing the technical expertise. When we were confronted with the corporate and&#13;
financial restructuring, people could not say that half of those added country economists can do&#13;
it. Why? Because everybody knew. And Jim Wolfensohn said, "This is not a regular medicine;&#13;
this is brain surgery!" The downside of bad judgment would be immediately visible in the&#13;
markets, and you need to hire some of the best people in the world who can look at the Bank and&#13;
say, "You pull the plug on this one," or "No, you invest 100 million bucks in fixing it up," or&#13;
"You restructure it in the following way." And you've got to have people who have really got&#13;
tremendous knowledge and expertise about these kinds of things.&#13;
&#13;
Well, I submit that what people accepted as being necessary for corporate and bank restructuring&#13;
is true of all cycles. And if you have bad judgment on the irrigation project, it'll just show up ten&#13;
years later. You'll have salinization of the soil, water logging and bad drainage and so on. If you&#13;
have bad environmental decisions being made today, they'll show up ten years later. The&#13;
difference with the Bank, in fact, is that it shows up immediately. Now, as a result of that, we&#13;
need these technical experts in every field. And just as you would say this is not a matter of&#13;
whether people like them or not, we really want the best. We should want that in every field.&#13;
And if you reduce the internal talking to each other and negotiating with each other to get our&#13;
work programs together, then the staff would have more time to actually talk to their colleagues&#13;
in the UN, in the civil society, in the countries, in the private sector, and these alliances would be&#13;
built much better.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: At some point, the Bank distanced itself from the UN because the UN was perceived to&#13;
be more political.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I donâ&#128;&#153;t recall that particular view even being political. It was seen as, yeah,&#13;
not hard-nosed enough. That's what the issue was. Not focusing enough on the economic&#13;
fundamentals.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
But there was a view of whether the Bank was really building an alliance with the private sector&#13;
and the Part One countries or whether it was there for the Part Two countries. I think this is now&#13;
being clearly resolved under Wolfensohnâ&#128;&#153;s leadership of the GR working with the private sector&#13;
and the Part One countries. They really are there for the Part Twos, and the UN has a bad name&#13;
in many circles, especially conservative congressional circles in the U.S. It's still the only forum&#13;
in the world for dealing with certain political issues. But it has a huge developmental mandate,&#13;
and it created a developmental mandate through the series of summits that took place in the&#13;
1990s. And some of our colleagues who at the time didn't appreciate these summits where the&#13;
Bank was--missed the point.&#13;
&#13;
I'm happy to say that at those summits which I had been entrusted to dealing with, the Bank was&#13;
regarded as a tremendous success! I was in charge of two of those summits, the one for Habitat&#13;
and the other for Insecurities, in Istanbul in '96 and Rome in November '96. In both cases, the&#13;
Bank was not only not criticized, not attacked, but people quoted us. I was happy afterwards to&#13;
organize our own summit, which was the Civil Society summit for the micro finance. Again, the&#13;
Bank got very high kudos, and Jim Wolfensohn later went on the campaign committee of the&#13;
micro finance. So we really shifted gears around that time. But it was only during the '92 to '96&#13;
period that there was some serious question on this issue.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How do you see the Bank's coordination efforts with bilateral and multilateral&#13;
international agencies?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I think we're doing quite well on the country-specifics, less well on the&#13;
thematic. We should be doing more on the thematic.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Turning to some other questions about management and the Bank's mission. We've&#13;
touched on some of these issues already, but one issue is the question of decentralization which&#13;
is a key issue in management of many large scale organizations. Other than decentralization&#13;
bringing the Bank closer to its clients, what are the benefits/costs to the Bank in the field and at&#13;
headquarters?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I have mixed views about that. First of all, that issue is one of those&#13;
pendulum-type issues: you've gone too far one way and then you swing towards the other, you&#13;
discover you've gone too far the other way, and you go back again in trying always to find the&#13;
right balance. And there's never a right balance because what is right today is not right five years&#13;
from now, and what was right five years ago is not right today. So you need to constantly fine-&#13;
tune that.&#13;
&#13;
But I think we make a mistake if we were to, for example, want to abolish the central&#13;
headquarters and put all our staff in the field, because one of the things that countries look for to&#13;
the Bank, as opposed to regional banks is--for instance, somebody in Brazil wants to know not&#13;
what's happening in Argentina and Chile, not just whatâ&#128;&#153;s happening in Brazil; they want to know&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   44&#13;
&#13;
what's happening in China, what's happening in Russia, what's happening in France, what's&#13;
happening in South Africa, what's happening in India. Only the World Bank can provide that&#13;
across sectors. We would be giving up on an enormous comparative advantage, and that&#13;
enormous part that our clients value. If we were not able, in fact, to provide them with people&#13;
who have that kind of expertiseâ&#128;&#148;they donâ&#128;&#153;t get that kind of expertise by simply staying in the&#13;
country. Sure, we'll say weâ&#128;&#153;ll rotate them and so on, but I think when you rotate them, then you&#13;
also reduce one of the advantages of being close to the client and remaining in the field.&#13;
&#13;
Now, one other thing that I've advocated many times in the past and that's never really been&#13;
picked up on is that I want real geographic specialists in the Bank. We don't have those. We&#13;
have country directors who go and serve three years in a country and then move to serve three&#13;
years in another country. They're oriented, and they spend the first year learning about the&#13;
country and then the last two years doing, performing, and then they're off somewhere else, and&#13;
they start all over again. We need people who have institutional memory. For example, in the&#13;
State Department or in any Ministry of Foreign Affairs you have specialistsâ&#128;&#153; desks. There are&#13;
people who are sovietologists, Arabists, or whatever, who speak the language, who follow the&#13;
newspapers. We need to have permanent specialists who become the equivalent of political&#13;
advisors to the country operational managers who come and go from different countries and who&#13;
are there not necessarily as the person who runs the program, because otherwise he would&#13;
become stale, but who are there to provide an institutional memory and to continue with giving&#13;
them advice, but somebody who is really an expert on the politics of what's happening in that&#13;
country, the credibility of various factions in any particular location and so on, all these different&#13;
kinds of complexities, especially when you're dealing with institutional mechanisms and what&#13;
anchors what. If you have that mechanism and you have staff that are close to the country, and&#13;
then you have another group of staff who are thematic and technical specialists, you know what's&#13;
happening across the world in that area of expertise. And then you go and travel around and&#13;
intermingle with their colleagues located in a country. Then you have the kind of palette of skills&#13;
that can serve the client best.&#13;
&#13;
When you take an approach like that, you immediately see that a lot of the discussion about&#13;
decentralization versus non-decentralization is not really very relevant. It's all about how you&#13;
mix that palette. And so for individual countries the mixes should be different. Every region&#13;
should be different. And that's, I think, a much more nuanced approach to the question.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What works against creating these area specialists in the Bank? What's in the&#13;
Bank's culture, its training, its recruitment, that works against that?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I think part of it is, of course, that you have a tendency to be worried&#13;
about people becoming too closely identified for too long a period of time with a particular&#13;
location. You have a tendency that's built into the economic thinking that ultimatelyâ&#128;&#148;you know,&#13;
economic and economics, although itâ&#128;&#153;s not stated that way--that theory applies pretty much&#13;
anywhere. You just have to fine tune it a little bit. The sociologists have never been able to&#13;
make headway because they are always in a position where somebody who's a specialist in&#13;

&#13;
bushmen wouldn't dare to believe that they are in a position to discuss Amerindians in the&#13;
Amazon; whereas, of course, an economist feels perfectly comfortable that they can project their&#13;
experience from Brazil to Thailand without too much difference which seems to apply and so on.&#13;
So these perceptions are there. I think, for a while, we are also tempted to say our staff should&#13;
do that, but I think it's a mistake to assume that even a smart kid that appears to be from&#13;
Princeton or Harvard can be parachuted somewhere and then have a sensibility to the issues. I&#13;
happen to know this because I've had some people work for me who were very elegant, very&#13;
persuasive, and proved to be absolutely dead wrong in reading the reality of the politics of the&#13;
countries they were talking about! And they looked good on paper! [Laughter] They sounded&#13;
good, but theyâ&#128;&#153;re not really good. So I think you need that differentiation today, especially with&#13;
all the budgetary constraints and people are trying to justify every week what they do.&#13;
&#13;
We're missing the fact by simply saying, â&#128;&#156;Well, what is the exact output person produces?â&#128;?&#13;
Well, it's better judgment. It's experience and advice, itâ&#128;&#153;s expert advice above the institutional,&#13;
cultural, political and social climate of the countries where we work. It does not translate&#13;
immediately into operations, but it translates ultimately into better judgment and hopefully into&#13;
more successful operations. But that would be seen as an overhead, and we've got to understand,&#13;
as I was saying earlier, many of these things are not overhead: they're institutional investments.&#13;
And I think it could be done much better if we do that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The next question has to do with the larger issue of organizational character or&#13;
culture in the Bank. Is the Bank's corporate structure meeting the evolving demands of the&#13;
Bank's expanding mission? What else needs to be done to prove the effectiveness of the way the&#13;
Bank is organized?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I've expressed my views on that. I believe that we should have a much&#13;
stronger thematic construct in the Bank with much greater emphasis on quality of the technical&#13;
staff and giving them greater say by reducing the emphasis on internal contracting arrangements&#13;
and increasing the commitment to excellence in terms of recognizing that excellence through&#13;
peer reviews and systematic disentanglement. I believe that the geographic departments should&#13;
have the funds to remain demand-driven.&#13;
&#13;
When I was in charge of a geographic department, I was frustrated because the projects staff&#13;
were insisting on spending all the funds, for example, on Cameroon or Chad, spending all their&#13;
time doing a project I knew was never going anywhere! The Cameroon government didn't want&#13;
it, it didn't fit with our strategy, but they were still doing it. At the same time, Chad had just&#13;
come out of a civil war; we were restoring our relations with them and wanted to send a mission&#13;
there. They said, â&#128;&#156;We can't spare the people to send them.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, both of those countries are in my domain and in your division. Stop working&#13;
on Cameroon and send these people to Chad, because I'm telling you this project is going to go&#13;
nowhere!"&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 46&#13;
&#13;
At the time, because the Projects Department controlled that budget, they really had a situation&#13;
which was supply-driven. Now to remedy that--and I was one of the strong advocates of that--&#13;
we went for the reorganization of '87 which basically created the country departments. And as a&#13;
country director, I was very happy to have my own projects staff, and I could re-deploy them&#13;
very quickly, and the cost situations worked very well. But the real issue was that we lost that&#13;
central core, and by losing that central core we were at a very real risk. How?&#13;
&#13;
Well, take Africa at the time--780 plus professionals. We had a small human resource division&#13;
for each country department and only one human resource division in projects. If you have a&#13;
small division for human resources--I had such a division handling population, health, nutrition,&#13;
and education--you ended up basically having two people in education. One of them was going&#13;
to be an educational economist and one was going to be an educational generalist, general&#13;
educator, as we called them. And the general educator was comparable to a technical specialist.&#13;
What you ended up with was that you didn't have an educational specialist, an agricultural&#13;
educational specialist, a vegetation specialist and so on; you had only that general educator, and&#13;
the net result was that you ended up by aggregating all the decisions. You had no specialist in&#13;
agricultural education in the Africa region which is a place in the world where agricultural&#13;
education was important. So how come we couldn't afford to do that?&#13;
&#13;
Well, when I was arguing about that, Howard [phonetic] said, "Well, you're a manager. Why the&#13;
hell are you making these decisions?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Because they're the rational decisions, given the frame I'm given to do. But I have&#13;
enough vision to recognize that it's the wrong decision for the institution! Now, if you tell me&#13;
you have to operate this program and this is the number of slots you have to hire people and all I&#13;
can afford are two people for the education sector as opposed to the health sector and so on, I'm&#13;
going to have one economist and one general educator. I can't have one agriculture educator and&#13;
then nobody to address general education issues or teacher training or vocational training, so I'm&#13;
going to end up making that decision.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
I mean, every other person would make the same decision. Your aggregation is sub-optimal, and&#13;
I think we need to rectify that.&#13;
&#13;
So, what we tried to rectify in the reorganization of the â&#128;&#152;90s was in fact to create these networks,&#13;
but we didn't go far enough. My view was that we should have basically recreated project-&#13;
specific departments, project departments with sectorial specialty, but not to go back to the pre&#13;
'87. Keep the budget in the country departments, but forbid the country departments from having&#13;
their own staff. Now, the difference would have been that I would have been able to go to the&#13;
guy who was working on Cameroon and Chad and say, "Sorry, there's no more money. Not a&#13;
single person is going to go to Cameroon, and I want people to go to Chad now, but you provide&#13;
the people. You're responsible for the quality of the work! You have enough critical mass to&#13;
have your technical educator and your vocational educator and your general educator and your&#13;
ag economist, and you know how to deploy how many weeks of each on this particular project,&#13;

&#13;
that particular project and so on. But at the same time, you're not the one who decides which&#13;
project you want to do in which country because the country people are the ones who are&#13;
dialoguing with the countries that can decide that.â&#128;? Now, if we were to do that, then I think we&#13;
would have a more viable situation, but it would require going further in strengthening the&#13;
thematic versus the geographic in the Bank. And that's one of the problems I see that we have.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In large corporations, this whole idea of networking, using and assigning people for&#13;
specific projects and then assigning them to something else, has become very common. And so&#13;
you're saying that's still not the case at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Corporations are a bad model because the Bank is not really a corporation.&#13;
We do not have a bottom line.&#13;
&#13;
And I'll give you an example. We talk about American corporations being very short-term,&#13;
driven by financial returns and equity to shareholders and so on. I visited many corporations.&#13;
What was striking was that 15 percent of the time of their staff was unallocated. I asked, â&#128;&#156;What&#13;
do they do? Is it different from training? Is it different from attending conferences? Is it&#13;
different from vacations?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
I was told, â&#128;&#156;They can do whatever they like. They can watch television, they can read&#13;
magazines, they can play basketball, they can work on the same project they're working on&#13;
today, or they can do something else. But we knowâ&#128;&#148;I canâ&#128;&#153;t tell you what the outcome will be,&#13;
but I will tell you that the next generation of projects--80 percent of them--are going to come out&#13;
of whatever is going to be done in this 15 percent of the time. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whoâ&#128;&#153;s going to do&#13;
what, where and howâ&#128;&#148;which will pan outâ&#128;&#148;but I save that space for people to be able to think.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And here's the catch. The reason they can do that is because they have a lot of money. The&#13;
management can tell the shareholders, "Look, hold me accountable for the bottom line. How I&#13;
manage on a day-to-day basis, leave that to me."&#13;
&#13;
Now, the Bank is much closer to a government set-up, and in that sense, it's very difficult to say,&#13;
"Here's the bottom line." So the tendency is for our owners--the shareholders--to try to control&#13;
the inputs because they can't have a clear output to measure.&#13;
&#13;
And it would be unthinkable for Jim Wolfensohn to go and say, "You know, I would like to have&#13;
ten percent of staff time unallocated."&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Ten percent of the company's staff years multiplied by how much? You know how many&#13;
millions that is for nothing? What do you mean, â&#128;&#152;Nothingâ&#128;&#153;!" [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
That's the way public institutions work. So there's a limit to what parallels we can have with the&#13;
private sector because the presence of that very clear bottom line allows degrees of freedom&#13;
which are not allowed in a more public climate.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, we have political obligations that private sectors don't have. I mean, Jack Welch can&#13;
say, â&#128;&#156;You're number one or you're number two or you're out of this business!â&#128;? And in the Bank&#13;
you can't say, "Well, I don't like Russia, so I'm not going to work in Russia. I'm going to work&#13;
there" or "By the way, we should be out of transport and rural, and we should be involved only&#13;
in telecoms." You can't do this! There are a lot of constituencies out there that are expecting it.&#13;
It's much more like a government. I mean, a mayor canâ&#128;&#153;t say, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to focus on street lights&#13;
and fire safety, but not on police work, not on health, not on work and not on schools,â&#128;? or â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;ll&#13;
focus on schools and housing but not on . . .â&#128;? [Laughter] You know, you canâ&#128;&#153;t do this!&#13;
&#13;
So we are much closer, in that sense, in terms of our relationships to our owners, and we're&#13;
accountable to a government where people want a lot of different things and are trying to control&#13;
the input and the budget than we are with the corporation which says, "Hold me accountable for&#13;
a bottom line, and then give me lots of freedom on how to manage." And I think, therefore, the&#13;
idea of what you can do on these issuesâ&#128;&#148;you have to take from different models, hopefully&#13;
knowing what can be transferred and what canâ&#128;&#153;t.&#13;
&#13;
I talked to some former Bank senior managers who are now on Wall Street about the difference&#13;
in management. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a totally different world. And one of the simplest things is secrecy and&#13;
confidentiality. If you're an investment banker, you don't tell people what you're doing with your&#13;
client. You can customize every solution to every client, and the clients expect confidentiality&#13;
from you. [Laughter] The last thing they want is their banker to go blurting a lot of what theyâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
doing, what theyâ&#128;&#153;re thinking, what theyâ&#128;&#153;re not thinking! So, as a result you have totally different&#13;
worlds. In the Bank, everything we do is not only public, its approved by everybody on the&#13;
Board, but it creates precedence: "Ah, you know, you treated this country this way; therefore,&#13;
you have to treat all countries in the same way."&#13;
&#13;
So you have a whole mechanism by which not only you have a bottom line there, but you also&#13;
have different kinds of relationships with your clients. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s work is very different. This&#13;
whole management question has to be looked at in the light of something very special, which is&#13;
the World Bank, which is the premier development institution in the world, which has enormous&#13;
comparative advantage, which is not going to be an NGO or a commercial bank. They are very&#13;
different animals.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: We've talked a little bit about self-assessment already, but I'd like to follow up with&#13;
a broader question. In your opinion, how effective--we might say overall--are the Bank's current&#13;
self-assessment instruments in terms of strategy and internal control? And, in your opinion, what&#13;
still needs to be done?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, we've already covered that. I think we need peer review; we need many&#13;
mediations between the staff who do the transactions and those who evaluate the institutional&#13;
reputational risk. I think we need more of a staff mix. I think we need less internal transactions&#13;
and more focus on the overall quality. I've made my estimates in various memoranda. I've&#13;

&#13;
written to my colleagues as to how this should be done, and Iâ&#128;&#153;ve spoken about most of these&#13;
comments.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In terms of evaluation, you say it's so difficult because the Bank is a quas-&#13;
governmental organization. In terms of its multi-dimensional approach to development, how&#13;
does the Bank evaluate success in a country where it is following several different strategies&#13;
simultaneously; i.e., trying to create a civil society, improving governance, while perhaps&#13;
carrying on a program directed to urban areas?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: What do you mean several different strategies at the same time? They are not&#13;
several strategies, they're the same strategy. It's just a matter of being clear of what is the&#13;
government strategy and what is the Bank's strategy to assist the government strategy and to&#13;
remember that we're not running the country, we're there to help, and we can only do a little bit.&#13;
In a book I wrote called Nurturing Development, I wrote on the flyleaf my philosophy, and it&#13;
says, "Development is like a tree. You make it grow by feeding its roots, not by pulling on its&#13;
branches." Conditionality and all that doesn't work; we have to understand what our role is. It's&#13;
very limited. And by helping groups in terms of engaging the private sector, civil societies,&#13;
stronger institutions, better ownerships, et cetera, you actually ultimately promote development.&#13;
And, yes, macroeconomic policies, sound investment, human resources, girlsâ&#128;&#153; education, all&#13;
these are pretty well known things you have to pick up, and the Bank can help you do that. But&#13;
in the end we have a strategy, and it should not be contradictory.&#13;
&#13;
Measuring success is very difficult, but I think there have been good efforts done by Bob&#13;
[Robert] Picciotto in OED in finding mechanisms. And there is, by and large, a judgment which&#13;
is exercised by peers. It's true in almost any area, any discipline, where it is a knowledge&#13;
discipline. If you look at the medical profession, let's say if the patient dies, did the doctor do a&#13;
good job or a bad job? The assumption is that the only way the doctor does a good job is if the&#13;
patient lives. It puts enormous assumed power in the hands of the doctor, which is not true. But&#13;
there is a judgment that is exercised by peers who would say, â&#128;&#156;Were all the judgment calls that&#13;
were made by the doctor in handling this very difficult case the best ones that could be done&#13;
professionally, sound ones? If they were, then that's a judgment of quality. We would say that&#13;
this doctor provided quality care for this patient and couldn't save him. But, you know, that's in&#13;
God's hands!â&#128;? [Laughter] That's very different from saying that this patient died because of&#13;
medical negligence. And you can tell the difference, even though both patients died. And those&#13;
who can tell the difference are other doctors. It's not some newspaper reporter who doesn't know&#13;
anything about medicine. It's other doctors who know something about that who can say, "This&#13;
was the right judgment call to make under the circumstances."&#13;
&#13;
And I go back again to saying that the way you handle that is peer review inside and outside the&#13;
institution. Peer review means people who really know the subject, not somebody who knows&#13;
nothing about the subject, but somebody who really knows the subject, is quite familiar with it&#13;
by experience, and who can evaluate judgment. So it's not as hard as a corporate bottom line, but&#13;
in all the professional disciplines that is what is done. That's how people get Nobel Prizes; that's&#13;

how people get tenure at universities. Other people evaluate the quality of their work. It's not&#13;
hard and fast, but systematically historians are evaluated by other historians. And there are&#13;
people who are recognized as leaders in their field at any one point in time, even if afterwards&#13;
their views are discovered to be faulty.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Or surpassed.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Or surpassed by others, but, at any one point people will tell you, "Yes, these&#13;
are, in our community of practice, these are the leaders.â&#128;? And we can get the judgment of those&#13;
leaders to bear on particular things. It is not impossible to do.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Although we've touched somewhat on some of the World Bank presidents, we'd like&#13;
to ask you some further questions about that. Let me ask you about your perceptions of&#13;
President Wolfensohn and his mission, in particular the point that some observers have&#13;
maintained that he was taking on too much for the Bank and that a stronger focus on main issues&#13;
would be wise.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I disagree. Every word that Jim Wolfensohn has said since joining the Bank&#13;
has been music to my ears. And I've told him so, and I've said so publicly on other occasions,&#13;
and I say so again now. I think he's absolutely right in all the issues that he's been highlighting;&#13;
i.e., corruption to civil society to participation to women to the environment to all of these&#13;
issues!&#13;
&#13;
I donâ&#128;&#153;t think thatâ&#128;&#153;s the issue at all. And I told my colleagues that they are wrong. The biggest&#13;
comparative advantage of the Bank is precisely that it is the only institution in the world that has&#13;
global reach across all regions, that works in all sectors, because UN agencies, FAO and so on,&#13;
have global mandates but they work in one sector. We work in all sectors, and we work&#13;
globally. And it would be a mistake to let go of that comparative advantage because it's a niche&#13;
that the Bank is positioned in to provide services to the world which nobody else can fill, and&#13;
therefore, far from saying that we should become specialists in this area or that area, we would&#13;
miss the key comparative advantage of the Bank. The difficulty is how do you integrate these&#13;
things so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts, how to actually build synergies&#13;
between these different parts.&#13;
&#13;
So the issues are not what the president has been sayingâ&#128;&#148;which I think is absolutely right on&#13;
target--it is how do you translate that into actual action. I'm not concerned that his words are&#13;
ahead of the actions today. I just want to make sure that the gap doesn't translate into cynicism&#13;
or becomes too big. I believe--and there's no question in my mind--that the president should be&#13;
ahead of the institution and should be pulling the institution behind him.&#13;
&#13;
Now, McNamara was like that. What he was saying didn't exist in the Bank! At the time of his&#13;
Nairobi speech, we didn't have the World Development Report (WDR); we didn't have an Urban&#13;
Development; we didn't have any of those things. But then they were invented, and they were&#13;

&#13;
created or added. And what was important, which again shows vision and leadership, is that we&#13;
didn't say in those days, "Well, we don't have the staff to do this." We defined that here is&#13;
something important, population is important, so we are going to hire some people who are in&#13;
population. Environment is important. When we decided to create the Environmental&#13;
Department, we had three people in environment in the Bank. When I left, we had over 300.&#13;
We had more environmental specialists than units--more than any other agency. It was one of&#13;
the largest concentrations of people. That's what we do, and if it's an important area youâ&#128;&#153;re going&#13;
to go out and hire the expertise. And you build the expertise because you've decided it's an&#13;
important area to be in. Otherwise you simply say, "Well, no."&#13;
&#13;
It's like the old story of building the best horse whips for buggies or whatever it is or harnesses&#13;
for buggies and you're not noticing that Henry Ford is building horseless carriages next door!&#13;
You can be the best at what you're doing, but you might be becoming irrelevant in what you're&#13;
doing because the world is moving in another direction. So you've got to be willing to transform&#13;
what you do to meet constantly the demands of the world. So as far as I'm concerned, I think the&#13;
message of President Wolfensohn is right on target. He's absolutely right moving in this&#13;
direction. The question is the mechanisms inside the Bank, and we've talked about those&#13;
already.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, in talking about the presidents, you've mentioned McNamara and Preston.&#13;
You have not mentioned either [Alden W.] Clausen or [Barber B.] Conable. Could you . . .&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I had the privilege of working with several Bank presidents, and they've all&#13;
been wonderful people in different ways. I mentioned Bob McNamara, who I'm very proud to&#13;
consider a friend today. At the time, as I said, he influenced me to stay in the Bank, which I&#13;
wouldn't have done otherwise had it not been for his shift at a time when we didn't talk about&#13;
poverty or rural development.&#13;
&#13;
When Tom Clausen came, it was a time that I received a huge promotion to director. I've had&#13;
very good relations with Tom Clausen over the years. Tom, in fact, had lunch with David Bock,&#13;
Hani Findakly and myself, all three of whom had become directors, and he asked us, "What do&#13;
you think we should do, that I should do?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, I believe that you need to send a strong signal to the staff that it's okay to take&#13;
risks and that they should be less timid about what they do." And I had told him before the story&#13;
about when I was promoted and the reaction of some of my staff, "Yeah, we know how the&#13;
system really works!" I told him he should do that.&#13;
&#13;
His reaction was very interesting. He said, "Well, I have just promoted the three of you to very&#13;
high positions. None of you are exactly known as being shrinking violets, so why is it that this is&#13;
not seen as a signal?"&#13;
&#13;
I don't have an answer for that, and I don't know why. I even told my staff that they should read&#13;
                                        M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                             October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               52&#13;
&#13;
this as a signal, and there was a lot of skepticism about it. So I'm not clear about that.&#13;
&#13;
Tom, I think, was willing to make the decisions at that time. The fact that he delegated an&#13;
enormous amount of authority to Ernie Stern in the management of day-to-day operations I think&#13;
was a thoughtful judgment on his part. The Bank at the time, like every financial institution, was&#13;
in deep financial trouble. We were lending on fixed rates at a time when interest rates had&#13;
jumped up to 22 percent. Prime rates were 19 percent. Inflation--you remember it was the end&#13;
of the [Jimmy] Carter-[Paul A. Jr.] Volcker situation--and we were stuck; we were in a very bad&#13;
situation. And Tom, coming from a commercial bank, Bank of America, that was his area of&#13;
expertise. And he introduced variable rates, fees, et cetera, and expanded treasury operations at&#13;
the time. And now there was somebody, Ernie Stern, who knew the development side of the&#13;
business inside out, and so why not delegate the authority to him on that and have much more&#13;
personal involvement in the financial side? That's one of the reasons why a lot of the operations&#13;
staff didn't feel his presence or felt that he was very distant or that he had nothing to do with&#13;
what they worked on. But I think they were misreading the situation because they weren't really&#13;
looking at the financial position of the Bank, which he helped extend.&#13;
&#13;
Barber Conable was a very different person. He was a wonderful man, wonderful human being.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: A poet, I think.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Among other things. Actually, a specialist in Native American history--&#13;
human history. Yes, fond of poetry as well. We traveled together a number of times and became&#13;
friends. I handled his external relations for him, translating for him in French and Arabic. On&#13;
one occasion he said, "I'm not sure which I like best, to have you as my interpreter or as a&#13;
director." [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
We traveled in Cote Dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Mauritaniaâ&#128;&#148;funny story about that because I did all the&#13;
interpretation for him. When I was in Mauritania, somebody said to me, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;m very impressed&#13;
with the president of the World Bank.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, he's a great person."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "He speaks perfect Arabic."&#13;
&#13;
"No, he doesn't," I said.&#13;
&#13;
"No, no," he says, "he speaks perfect Arabic."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "No, he doesn't! I know!"&#13;
&#13;
So it turned out that on landing they had an interview with him at the airport and I had&#13;
interpreted for him. Well, what they had done, they had edited and put my voice into his&#13;

&#13;
answers. So the questions had been posed in Arabic and he answered in English, but they had&#13;
my Arabic voice coming across. [Laughter] So people: â&#128;&#156;My god, the World Bank president&#13;
speaks perfect Arabic!â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Very good PR!&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: PR, yeah, it was very good.&#13;
&#13;
Barber had an enormous human touch. People loved him. In Cote d'Ivoire he was called&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Conableh,â&#128;? which is a very--sort of adopted as a tribal chief. And he had this spontaneous&#13;
human gesture which was marvelous. When they had all these tribal dances there, he got up and&#13;
danced with them! [Laughter] It was spontaneous; it was natural. It was at ease. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
something that caused problems for anybody. And so I think he did that.&#13;
&#13;
I think he also took major decisions for the Bank, introducing environment, introducing the&#13;
gender dimension--WID (Women in Development), as we called it at the time--within the&#13;
development program.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Would you say that he introduced the environment in the Bank or that he spurred it on?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: No, he created it. He created the present Environment Department.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: He created the department, yes, but the environment as an issue, was it not first&#13;
discussed during McNamara's time?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Yeah, well if you want to go back to that, yes, James Leeâ&#128;&#153;s office and so on.&#13;
But I'm talking about really taking on the issue that we should do something much more&#13;
systematic about the environment and have an Environment Department rather than three&#13;
advisors, and creating an environmental department and they hired Ken [Kenneth W.] Piddington&#13;
as its first director in 1988 and so on. And it was on his watch that these things happened. And&#13;
he was getting, of course, the beginnings of all the flak that was later on to come out into the&#13;
open in terms of the Narmada case and the evaluation that was done by Bradford Morse, which&#13;
led to the whole issue and campaign against the Bank. And all these kinds of things that were&#13;
brewing at the time. Barber responded by creating the Environment Department, creating the&#13;
first Women in Development initiative, which I thought were very important initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of humanizing relationships, I think he was an absolutely marvelous person. He had the&#13;
idea for the four senior vice presidents, which in a sense created or expanded the role of the&#13;
policy side of the Bank very significantly. I think that he did extremely well in some of those&#13;
areas, but of course there were a lot of other issues at the Bank. I had lots of dealings with him&#13;
directly on the issues of the CFA franc, which were very controversial issues because of the&#13;
multi-country issue of devaluation and so on. It always went up all the way to the president; we&#13;
used to have these very difficult conclaves there.&#13;

&#13;
Lew Preston, I think, interestingly enough, despite the fact that he was perhaps the person who&#13;
was least comfortable with public speaking, is the person who presided over the biggest opening&#13;
up of the Bank, from the Disclosure Policy to the Inspection Panel to the systemization of NGOs&#13;
linkages, to all of these things. I recall that I suggested at the first session after his death of what&#13;
should we sod, I said, â&#128;&#156;Well, our new auditorium should be named after him because, after all,&#13;
we used to have a Eugene Black auditorium.â&#128;? Lew ultimately was the one who opened up the&#13;
Bank in many, many ways such as the scope of policy, the availability of information and the&#13;
Inspection Panel and so on, and therefore the auditorium, which is most used for external&#13;
functions, that is why it should be named after him.&#13;
&#13;
And so I had the privilege of working with all these very unusual and very different people.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Having said that theyâ&#128;&#153;re all different, what qualities do you think a World Bank&#13;
president should have?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: He should have vision; he should have political flare--especially political&#13;
flare--and should have the ability to choose and motivate a team of very, very good senior&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
You know, one of the qualities which we did not discuss about Wolfensohn, which I think we&#13;
must--I give him very, very high marks for his ability to get IDA through the U.S. Congress.&#13;
The atmosphere on IDA was being poisoned. The Europeans were trying to create a separate&#13;
fund that would keep the U.S. from procurement. The Congress was about to go into a counter&#13;
measure with a sanction against IDA which would have been at tremendous cost for IDA, not&#13;
just a matter of paying up the arrears of the U.S., but with poisoning the atmosphere for the next&#13;
negotiations. I think Wolfensohn's ability to disentangle that from the Congress and get the U.S.&#13;
to agree to pay up IDA, despite the UN being in the way and despite the IMF having problems,&#13;
not only was it an enormous political achievement, but it is something only the president can do.&#13;
It is not something that somebody else can do.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Was this the IDA 13?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Yes, yes. It was very, very important.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Do you think Bank presidents need to have had careers in finance before they come&#13;
to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: No, no. Not necessarily. I mean, it certainly helps to know something about&#13;
finance. It also helps to know something about development. It also helps to know something&#13;
about management. But, in a way, whichever of these routes you take in your own career, at the&#13;
end of the day it requires a leader who has to have an ability to look at all these different facets,&#13;
not look at just one facet and not the other.&#13;
                                        M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                               October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has also been very lucky in its superb senior managers. I've worked with some of the&#13;
best, from Moeen Qureshi, Ernie Stern, Sven Sandstrom. All of them are very different people,&#13;
again, but all of them are people of remarkable, remarkable qualities! I think that the ability to&#13;
attract and manage people like that is what's required of a president of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: If you were president, where would you take the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, I've said that I fully agree with the direction that Jim Wolfensohn is&#13;
taking, but where I would want to spend more time is on the issues of the internal constructs of&#13;
the Bank that would lead us to greater implementation of their vision. I have no disagreement&#13;
with the direction of that. In the internal structure, I have already said all the things that I had to&#13;
say about the thematic and geographic, on the changes on the budget and the ability to look at the&#13;
institutional rather than the local themes and all these kinds of things, peer review for the overall&#13;
quality, staff profiles. I mean, there are a lot of things that have to change, but they would be in&#13;
consonance with the vision that Jim Wolfensohn has been projecting for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Turning to some of your own reflections about your career at the Bank, which also&#13;
includes a question about perhaps what your next plans are. What do you think your&#13;
contribution has been to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: I think what I've done in the Bank, which was all my life, was to try to&#13;
broaden the paradigm of thinking at the Bank, whether it was to add things that were not there or&#13;
look at issues that were either not being looked at, or look differently, from involving local&#13;
communities back in the 1970s in places like Yemenâ&#128;&#148;before we called them NGOs--to dealing&#13;
with introducing new analytical tools on the quality of retention of skills in education and&#13;
literacy, social culture, newer studies that I did in the mid-â&#128;&#152;70s in Saudi Arabia, or looking at,&#13;
later on, the social dimensions of adjustment, cultural dimensions, governance issues, military&#13;
spending.&#13;
&#13;
Barber Conable deserves a lot of credit for having broached the military spending first, and I was&#13;
very proud of him. He took it up in his Annual Meeting speech. It was just like Jim Wolfensohn&#13;
took on the issue of corruption and expanding environment, gender, cultural and social capital.&#13;
So I've been always trying to expand the thinking of the Bank away from the narrowly economic&#13;
or technocratic towards the broader vision of developments for the well-being of people. You&#13;
can't understand these if you don't understand how societies function; what motivates people.&#13;
&#13;
And I'm very proud of the fact that in one of the last big things that I was doing, which was the&#13;
social capital, one person looked at me and said, "You know, I wish you wouldn't talk about this&#13;
issue of the cultural dimensions of identity and so on, because it's beginning to sound flaky."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "I'm going to make a T-shirt that says, 'Flaky and proud of it!'" Because of the&#13;
number of times I've heard that about a number of issues that we've talked about over the years,&#13;
                                      M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                            October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    56&#13;
&#13;
and many of those ideas that a person said were â&#128;&#156;flakyâ&#128;? are now mainstream!&#13;
&#13;
I'm also proud of the fact that in my farewell speech Jim Wolfensohn was kind enough to refer to&#13;
that, as was Ian Johnson, that in many ways a lot of the things that I did, five, ten years later&#13;
became mainstream. At the time, they were not seen as mainstream. So I look back at that, and I&#13;
think, yes, I did make a certain contribution.&#13;
&#13;
And I also think that I helped build bridges between the Bank and many other institutions, the&#13;
UN, for example. I tried to defend our links with the UN when they were being attacked, tried to&#13;
defend our links with civil society when they were being attacked, with the NGOs, building&#13;
alliances with our critics because I believe these are our natural allies. They're the only people&#13;
who genuinely care about development issues, poverty; they should be our natural allies. And&#13;
we have to reach out to them and try to bring them on board on some of those things. So I think&#13;
I've done a lot of that over the years, and I hope that when the assessments are being done, yes, I&#13;
did hopefully make a difference.&#13;
&#13;
But I would like to record again what I said earlier, that I've been very, very grateful for the&#13;
bosses Iâ&#128;&#153;ve had, the leaders I've had. I found this to be a remarkable place where you can do&#13;
almost anything, provided you have the capacity to present your case effectively and so on, that&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s a remarkably professional institution that recognizes quality, and this is one of the great&#13;
virtues of this institution which I worked in.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What would you say you've learned from your experience at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Oh, it's too difficult to disentangle from my own lifetime, as I spent 28 years in&#13;
the Bank. I've worked a lot in it, with it, from it, against it, for it--against it in the sense of the&#13;
broken paradigm and people wanting to shorten it. So it's been my life for a very long time, and&#13;
it's very difficult to gauge. I don't know. I'd say 80 percent of what I've learned about&#13;
development has come from the Bank and maybe 20 percent from outside of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Would you care to talk a bit about your future goals or plans?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Yes, I do. I can tell you exactly what my future goals and plans are. I am&#13;
hoping to take on one of the most exciting projects in the world, and, in fact, I had a good&#13;
discussion with Jim Wolfensohn about it. He is more excited about another project that he and I&#13;
once talked about. But the one that I am most likely to finally end up taking is the new Library&#13;
of Alexandria. That of course is absolutely unique for me.&#13;
&#13;
The Library of Alexandria for over six centuries was the center of universal learning, the beacon&#13;
of rationality and science in a world of superstition and bigotry. It was a magnet for the greatest&#13;
minds in the world, from Archimedes to Euclid, who wrote his elements of geometry there. All&#13;
                                       M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                              October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   57&#13;
&#13;
of those people came from all over the world. The idea of trying to do something again in the&#13;
developing countries today abounds with universal appeal, but at the same time it has grounding&#13;
in the developing countries today. And to be worthy of the mantle of the name of the Library of&#13;
Alexandria is quite a challenge. Right now is the process of drafting legislation to be presented&#13;
to the Egyptian Parliament, which I hope would be approved and would give the Library certain&#13;
special statutes that it needs to have in order to operate well, in which case I would hope to be&#13;
named to that position as First Librarian of Alexandria in over 1700 years, following a very&#13;
eminent set of names from Demetrius, Callimachus, Apollonius, Eratosthenes, Aristarchus, 1700&#13;
years later. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
Also it's a very big challenge, but also a challenge to think in terms of what does it mean to&#13;
design a library and research center in the age of the Internet. Who could have looked, 20 years&#13;
back in 1980, and said, "You'll have a billion pages on the Internet in the year 2000 and eight&#13;
billion pages in 2005.â&#128;? Who would have predicted that? Well, by the same token, as you sit&#13;
here today and say, "What sort of a world will we have in 2020? And then, what sort of library&#13;
should we be designing for that?" And it's not just a library. It's a library, a convention center, a&#13;
school of information sciences, a science museum planetarium and a calligraphy institute, all of&#13;
that complex together. So I think it is a very good project to work on.&#13;
&#13;
The other project is also to help advise the Egyptian government on the New Egyptian Museum&#13;
which I plan to set up. But the library is the one that appeals to me most, because I'm a man of&#13;
many interests. I published some art and architecture. Of all my works, the one I'm most proud&#13;
of is a monograph on Shakespeare. And so it's an opportunity to try, in fact, to think about how&#13;
do you present Egypt to the world, how do you present the world to Egypt, how do you establish&#13;
a library in the digital age, and how do you--in order to remain faithful to the tradition of the old&#13;
Library of Alexandria--create a vibrant center of intellectual debate between North and South,&#13;
East and West, and make it truly a place where the meeting of the minds in the best traditions of&#13;
the world can happen. And when this came up, I spoke with Jim, and I said, "I would like to&#13;
spend the next ten years of my life trying to make this dream happen!"&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How does that fit in with the UNESCO? How does the Library project fit into the&#13;
UNESCO programs?&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: It is a UNESCO-sponsored program.&#13;
&#13;
Following the campaign for UNESCO I had a discussion with Dr. [Koichiro] Matsuura. I asked&#13;
to see him privately. I said, â&#128;&#156;Look, I came to see you.â&#128;? Actually, I met him several times. And I&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;Look, I have two professional reasons and one personal.â&#128;? At the time I was heading the&#13;
World Commission on Water, and UNESCOâ&#128;&#153;s one of the co-sponsors of that, so I was&#13;
presenting the report rather than sending the report by mail. And then I briefed him about the big&#13;
summit meeting we had at The Hagueâ&#128;&#148;5770 people came from 158 countries. I am very proud&#13;
of that, and I briefed him about it.&#13;
&#13;
                                      M. Ismail Serageldin&#13;
                              October 25 and 26, 2000 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  58&#13;
&#13;
The personal thing I told him was: whatever happened in the elections, happened. Now weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
confronting the situation where I waged this entire campaign for UNESCO because I believe in&#13;
the old UNESCO. I waged a personal campaign; I was backed by the intellectuals of the world,&#13;
not by governments, except the Swedish and the Dutch and the Burkina Faso governments, those&#13;
were the ones who supported me. But I had lots of sympathy from all over the world. Fifteen of&#13;
the laureates, 300 of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s most eminent people from 59 countries signed the declaration of&#13;
support. It was an unprecedented line of support. But I waged that campaign because of my&#13;
belief in what UNESCO should do for humanity!&#13;
&#13;
I told Dr. Matsuura that today UNESCOâ&#128;&#153;s success is your success and your failure would be&#13;
UNESCOâ&#128;&#153;s failure. So you can count on my support of anything that will help this institution.&#13;
You know, some people who were very involved in the campaign were surprised by that. It&#13;
would be ludicrousâ&#128;&#148;I waged this campaign because I believe in the role of the institution and&#13;
then I say, â&#128;&#156;Well, if Iâ&#128;&#153;m not elected, then to hell with this institution!â&#128;? What kind of thinking is&#13;
that? It was total subjective and non-substantive thinking.&#13;
&#13;
I'm the kind of person who believes in substance. This institution has a major role to play. I&#13;
would've liked to be the head of UNESCO, but it wasn't to be! But I would certainly support&#13;
anything that can help UNESCO today. And the Library is one of the projects sponsored by&#13;
UNESCO, and I'm hoping it will be sponsored by others as well. I still maintain very good&#13;
relations with many of the UNESCO staff who have been my friends for many years.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well, thank you very much for your invaluable contribution to the Oral History&#13;
Program.&#13;
&#13;
SERAGELDIN: Well, thank you.&#13;
