&amp;#12;&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
Metro Manila&#13;
1.1   Metro Manila (MM), the National Capital Region, covers about 636 km2 along the&#13;
eastern shore of Manila Bay. MM is the Philippines' primary administrative center, with a&#13;
concentration of commerce, industry and services. Its eight cities and nine municipalities had a&#13;
1995 population of 8.9 million, about 30% of whom - mainly migrants from rural areas - live in&#13;
about 600 slums. Population pressures, ineffective control of industrial growth, and an absence of&#13;
development planning have overloaded the region's infrastructure and caused rapid environmental&#13;
deterioration.&#13;
Wastewater&#13;
1.2   About 18% of MM wastewater is collected by a sewer network and discharged untreated&#13;
into Manila Bay. The remainder is discharged into the public drainage system either directly or&#13;
through approximately 1 million household septic tanks constructed under the Sanitation Code.&#13;
Most of the septic tanks do not have on-site soil absorption systems and are rarely desludged.&#13;
Water Pollution&#13;
1.3   Most of the pollution generated from domestic, industrial, and commercial activities in&#13;
MM eventually ends up in the three primary water bodies: the rivers and canal system, Laguna de&#13;
Bay, and Manila Bay - a large shallow coastal water supporting thousands of fishing families. As&#13;
a result, the river system in MM is biologically dead, Laguna de Bay increasingly turbid, and the&#13;
eastern shoreline of Manila Bay is unsuitable for recreation. The daily water pollution load&#13;
generated in 1995 was estimated at about 980 tons of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), of&#13;
which 40% was from residential wastewater, 38% from industries and 22% from solid waste&#13;
dumped in rivers.&#13;
Institutions&#13;
1.4   Water supply and sewerage services in MM are provided by a government corporation,&#13;
the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), which also provides water supply&#13;
and sanitation services to one city and 19 municipalities in neighboring Rizal and the northern part&#13;
of Cavite provinces. Responsibility for drainage is divided between the Department of Public&#13;
Works and Highways (DPWH), which develops and operates the main flood-control system, and&#13;
the cities and municipalities, which build and maintain street drains.&#13;
1.5   The responsibility for planning and coordinating several metro-wide services - transport&#13;
and traffic management, solid waste management, pollution control, flood control, drainage,&#13;
sewerage, land use planning, and zoning - was recently vested in the Metropolitan Manila&#13;
Development Authority (MMDA) established in March 1995. Its policy-making and governing&#13;
body is a council composed of all MM mayors. The chairman of the council has the rank of a&#13;
cabinet member and is appointed by the President.&#13;
1.6   Other agencies involved in sector activities are DPWH, which oversees MWSS, the&#13;
Department of Health, which monitors drinking water quality, the National Water Resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Board, which coordinates water resources development and management, and the Environmental&#13;
Management Bureau (EMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR),&#13;
which plans environmental management, including enforcement of regulations. EMB is also&#13;
responsible for studies and programs aimed at reducing industrial pollution, and safe disposal of&#13;
toxic and hazardous waste. The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) is the&#13;
central agency for national development planning and coordinates programs, projects and policies&#13;
initiated by other government agencies.&#13;
Development Targets&#13;
1.7   Among the Government's key development objectives is economic development without&#13;
environmental degradation. This is reflected in'the 1993-98 Medium-Term Development Plan&#13;
(MTDP) and the MWSS Strategic Plan. The guiding principles in the MTDP include&#13;
decentralization, private sector-led development, public consultation, cost recovery, and social&#13;
equity. The MTDP provides a policy framework for MM water quality management strategy,&#13;
which includes programs for (a) expanding and improving the quality of sanitation services, and&#13;
(b) controlling the major sources of pollution in the area's waterways. It also provides the&#13;
framework under which water supply and sewerage master plans are being prepared for MM.&#13;
Previous Bank Lending&#13;
1.8   The Bank has supported MWSS with four loans for water supply and one for sewerage&#13;
and sanitation'. All projects have been completed and the completion reports (except for Ln&#13;
3124, which closed on December 31, 1995) found the projects to have substantially achieved all&#13;
physical objectives. Bank strategy in the sector is to support Government investment programs to&#13;
improve sewerage and sanitation. The proposed project would be the Bank's second major&#13;
sewerage and sanitation operation in the MM area; the first was the US$63 million loan for the&#13;
Manila Sewerage and Sanitation Project (Ln 1814-PH, 1980), which was cofinanced by the Asian&#13;
Development Bank. The project constituted the first phase of the sewerage master plan and&#13;
included rehabilitation of deteriorated sanitary sewers in the central area, extension of sanitary&#13;
sewers in adjacent areas, construction of combined sewers in about 14 km2 of low-income areas,&#13;
and upgrading of combined sewer and septic tank maintenance operations.&#13;
1.9   The start of the project coincided with the onset of economic difficulties in the Philippines.&#13;
As a result project completion was delayed by five years, some components were not completed&#13;
and others failed to have the anticipated impact because of the budgetary squeeze during the&#13;
economic crisis. Two project sub-components in particular failed to measure up to expectations;&#13;
the Sewerage System Department (SSD) was established under the project but was deprived of&#13;
resources resulting in premature decay of physical infrastructure; and the septic tank maintenance&#13;
could not be launched as the EMB failed to designate a landfill site for disposal of septage. Given&#13;
the circumstances, the performance audit report (No. 13204) found that the project substantially&#13;
achieved its objectives of extending the coverage of the sewer system and construction of&#13;
combined drainage and sewer system in low-income areas.&#13;
Manila Metropolitan Water Supply Project, Ln 386-PH (1964); Manila Water Supply II, Ln 1615-PH (1978); Manila&#13;
Sewerage and Sanitation Project, Ln 1814-PH (1980); Metropolitan Manila Water Distribution Project, Ln 2676-PH&#13;
(1986); Angat Water Supply Optimization Project, Ln 3124-PH (1989).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
Rationale for Bank involvement&#13;
1.10   The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy2 which identified&#13;
the need for upgrading infrastructure and improving management of human and industrial waste in&#13;
MM. In the improved economic situation, assistance can be resumed to MWSS to upgrade&#13;
wastewater infrastructure and take necessary steps in managing human waste consistent with the&#13;
environmental objectives of the Philippines and of the Bank. The Bank is also considering&#13;
assisting the Government in preparing separate projects addressing MM's industrial pollution and&#13;
solid waste management problems.&#13;
1.11   Since 1970s the Bank has shared with the Government and MWSS a concern about the&#13;
status of sewerage and sanitation services in MM and its funding of the first project puts it in an&#13;
advantageous position to support the agency's overall long-term development program. The Bank&#13;
has recently helped arrange assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in&#13;
formulating a long-term development program through updating the 1979 water supply and&#13;
sewerage master plan. Studies on the new 1996 master plan were completed in early 1996. The&#13;
updated plan envisages urgent renovation of the water distribution network to address the current&#13;
extremely high level of non-revenue water, development of a major new water source, and a&#13;
complementary distribution network. The plan also proposes changing from separate to&#13;
combined3 sewerage systems, and includes the construction of interceptor sewers, septage4&#13;
treatment plants, and wastewater treatment plants. The proposed project conforms with the&#13;
provisions of the master plan.&#13;
2   Memorandum of the President dated February 15, 1996.&#13;
3   Combined sewers provide one pipe for both surface water drainage as well as wastewater which is required to first pass&#13;
through a septic tank to remove solids. Hygienically superior separate sewers provide separate pipes for each service.&#13;
4   Septage is the septic tank contents, including the liquid and the solid matter settled in the lower part of the tank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
2. THE PROJECT AREA AND SERVICES&#13;
Project Area&#13;
2.1   Metropolitan Manila ranges from low-density predominantly agricultural parts to highly&#13;
congested areas where a large informal sector coexists with the formal sector. While roughly&#13;
56% of MM's population is employed, over 40% of households live below the poverty level in&#13;
slums, some occupying strips of land alongside railroad tracks and rivers. Population growth has&#13;
outstripped basic services, resulting in unhygienic and unpleasant living conditions, especially for&#13;
the poor. Annex 1 provides a detailed description of the project area and services.&#13;
Water Supply Service&#13;
2.2   Water supply is provided by MWSS. In 1994 the daily average production was 2.8&#13;
million m3. Out of 815,000 service connections about 93% were residential using about 66% of&#13;
the water sold. Most of the raw water (97%) comes from surface sources, and the rest from deep&#13;
wells. The current production capacity of 2.9 million m3/d is being increased to 4.0 million m3/d&#13;
in 1999. The quality of distribution system is a cause of serious concern, as NRW, of which the&#13;
major part is believed to be leakage, amounted to about 59% of production.' So far, attempts to&#13;
deal with the problem have been only marginally successful. Further improvements are to be&#13;
undertaken following on-going extensive studies of the distribution network.&#13;
Drainage, Sewerage and Solid Waste Disposal&#13;
2.3   MM terrain is flat and subject to flooding. Natural drainage is provided by the Marikina&#13;
and Pasig Rivers and short streams and canals (esteros), many of them interconnected. The&#13;
natural drainage system is complemented by an infrastructure network, divided into main and&#13;
street drainage. The Flood Control and Drainage Division of DPWH maintains the rivers and&#13;
main drainage facilities; street drainage is maintained by cities and municipalities. Both systems&#13;
suffer from frequent blockages caused by solid waste dumped in the drains and smaller streams.&#13;
2.4   Sewer system coverage in MM is very low. The majority of the population (5.5 million)&#13;
discharge wastewater into street drains via about 1 million septic tanks, and another 2 million&#13;
living in blighted areas dispose of liquid and solid wastes directly into drains and rivers. Only&#13;
about 1.4 million people are served by the three separate sewerage systems, Central, Ayala, and&#13;
Dagat-Dagatan. The Central sewerage system covers 26 km2 or 70% of Manila city and serves a&#13;
population of about 1.2 million. The Ayala and Dagat-Dagatan systems, in Makati and Malabon&#13;
municipalities, cover areas of 6 km2 and 5 km2, respectively, and serve 0.1 million people each.&#13;
The Central system discharges untreated wastewater into Manila Bay, the Ayala system has a&#13;
conventional activated sludge plant and the Dagat-Dagatan system provides treatment in waste&#13;
stabilization ponds. About 114 km of sewers in 41 minor sewerage systems provide simple&#13;
treatment in 39 communal septic and 2 Imhoff tanks. Except for the Central system, all others&#13;
discharge their output into the nearest river.&#13;
1  In 1995 the NRW was reduced to 52% of production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
2.5   Because of low priority accorded to sewerage and sanitation infrastructure maintenance&#13;
during the period of the economic crisis, the existing facilities have deteriorated. The Central&#13;
sewerage system suffers from broken pipes and manholes and surcharges in wet weather. Lift&#13;
stations are not adequately maintained, one of the twin pipes in the siphon under the Pasig river is&#13;
blocked, several pumps at the main Tondo pumping station are not functioning, and the outfall&#13;
pumping main into Manila Bay has restricted capacity, possibly because of blocked diffuser&#13;
outlets. Treatment at the newer plant at Dagat-Dagatan is satisfactory, but the performance of&#13;
the Ayala treatment plant is inadequate. The MWSS program for desludging septic tanks started&#13;
under the Bank-financed Manila Sewerage and Sanitation Project (para 1.8) cannot be&#13;
implemented due to absence of septage treatment facilities or designation of agricultural land&#13;
suitable for waste disposal.&#13;
2.6   The solid waste generated in MM, estimated in 1995 at 5,500 tons per day is partly&#13;
collected (about 75%) by the MMDA and private contractors and deposited in two sanitary&#13;
landfills. Some uncollected waste is buried or burned at source, but the majority of it is dumped&#13;
into drainage and open waterways.&#13;
Water Pollution Control&#13;
2.7   Inadequate control of municipal and industrial liquid and solid waste over the last decade,&#13;
combined with a large expansion of squatters and rural in-migration, have resulted in rapid&#13;
degradation of water quality and the Government has recently initiated corrective steps. The&#13;
municipalities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are gradually resettling squatters from&#13;
the strips along rivers and improving collection of solid waste. DENR has tightened control of&#13;
toxic and hazardous wastes, and commissioned studies aimed at finding ways to reduce industrial&#13;
waste and the resulting pollution of water and air. DENR's programs for pollution control will&#13;
include enforcement of stricter effluent regulations and coordinated plans for joint industrial&#13;
treatment facilities.&#13;
Operation and Maintenance&#13;
2.8   The sewerage and wastewater facilities are operated and maintained by the Sewerage&#13;
Systems Department (SSD) of MWSS. Its facilities include (a) the Central system network,&#13;
secondary boosting and the main Tondo pumping stations; (b) the Ayala system network and&#13;
wastewater treatment plant; (c) the Dagat-Dagatan system network and waste stabilization ponds,&#13;
and (d) minor sewerage systems with Imhoff and community septic tanks. Under the proposed&#13;
project, SSD would employ contractors to desludge septic tanks, maintain appropriate records,&#13;
and operate a pilot septage treatment plant to be built at Dagat-Dagatan. Unscheduled cleaning&#13;
of septic tanks on owner request will be provided by SSD's staff.&#13;
2.9   Maintenance of the network, equipment, and laboratory facilities is inadequate. The&#13;
project would supply equipment to improve maintenance and introduce procedures needed to&#13;
correctly estimate budgetary allocations for preventive maintenance.&#13;

Demand for the Project&#13;
2.10 MWSS implemented the first phase of 1979 master plan during 1980-89 (Manila&#13;
Sewerage and Sanitation project, para 1.8) and completed studies for the second phase of the&#13;
plan. It became apparent, however, that the plan could not be implemented as envisaged, due to&#13;
reluctance to bear the high cost of the conventional separate sewerage systems. Meanwhile,&#13;
existing sewerage facilities fell into disrepair due to inadequate maintenance, the program for&#13;
sewer house connection slowed, and the desludging of septic tanks practically stopped due to lack&#13;
of facilities for septage disposal.&#13;
2.11  The proposed project is designed to address these problems.  It would provide for&#13;
collection, treatment, and disposal of sludge collected from septic tanks (septage), rehabilitate&#13;
existing sewerage facilities, and accelerate provision of sewer house connections. It also includes&#13;
provision of specialized equipment to improve maintenance and design support for the follow-up&#13;
combined sewerage system that will make use of existing septic tanks.&#13;
2.12 The project's septage management component has widespread support among political&#13;
decision makers, the regulatory community, and the general public in Manila. The First Lady, as&#13;
the chairperson of the Pasig River Rehabilitation Committee, has endorsed the goal of raising&#13;
water quality in the Pasig River. It is clearly understood by all parties concerned that this goal is&#13;
not achievable without the septage management component of the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Origin&#13;
3.1   The 1979 sewerage master plan envisaged a phased expansion of the conventional&#13;
separate sewerage system, which now serves about 1 million people. Only a part of the plan was&#13;
implemented, and follow-up works were discontinued because of prohibitive costs. Subsequent&#13;
reviews have indicated that using the existing drainage network and about 1 million household&#13;
septic tanks would be a less expensive alternative for the remaining population. This would&#13;
require periodic removal of septage from the septic tanks, however, and MWSS now lacks the&#13;
treatment facilities or dump sites needed for septage disposal.&#13;
3.2   MWSS has, thus, developed a two-stage septage management plan. In the first phase&#13;
(1996-99) MWSS would desludge some 300,000 tanks while building a pilot (200 m3/day)&#13;
septage treatment plant. Most of the septage would be barged some 40 km off the Philippine&#13;
coast and dumped in the deep Pacific waters of the Marianas Trench.' Based on the data acquired&#13;
during the first phase, the second phase (2000-07) would be used to build technically and&#13;
institutionally appropriate land-based septage treatment plants, which would allow ocean dumping&#13;
to be terminated in 2003.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
3.3   The proposed project is intended to help the Government improve the quality of sanitation&#13;
services and enable MWSS to: (a) radically expand its septage management program and establish&#13;
the conditions needed for medium-term low-cost improvement of sewerage services in MM, and&#13;
(b) reduce pollution in MM waterways and Manila Bay, thereby reducing the health hazards&#13;
associated with human exposure to excreta.&#13;
3.4   Project performance monitoring will track the success of the project in accomplishing its&#13;
objectives, review what worked and what did not, and ensure that results of dispersion modeling,&#13;
ongoing environmental monitoring, and public consultations during the implementation of the&#13;
septage conveyance and disposal components are fully incorporated into future septage&#13;
management plans. Details of the monitoring and evaluation system and key project performance&#13;
indicators confirmed during negotiations are described in Annex 11.&#13;
Description&#13;
3.5   The project would include: (a) building three barge loading stations for septage disposal at&#13;
sea under a private collection and disposal contract, (b) building a pilot septage treatment plant,&#13;
(c) rehabilitating the Central and the Ayala sewerage systems, the Ayala treatment plant, and&#13;
constructing about 10,000 individual sewer connections, and (d) providing maintenance&#13;
equipment, tools, spare parts and laboratory instruments. Implementation support would include&#13;
(a) construction supervision and environmental monitoring and management assistance, (b)&#13;
Deep ocean dumping of much larger quantities of septage has been carried out by Japan and other countries for many&#13;
years, and is considered environmentally safe. See Para 3.27 and Annex 7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
preparing designs and documents for the follow-up expansion of the sewerage system and septage&#13;
treatment plants, and (c) preparing documents for the Manila Water Supply III project.&#13;
3.6   Private contractors would desludge 300,000 septic tanks during the project and transport&#13;
the septage to the treatment plant and to the barge loading stations for disposal at sea. The septic&#13;
tanks would be selected from areas in the vicinity of the Pasig River to yield immediate water&#13;
quality benefits and living condition improvements in low-income areas. Each of the three barge-&#13;
loading stations (at Napindan, Estero de Vitas and Paranaque) would have the capacity to transfer&#13;
about 500 m3/d of septage from collecting vehicles to barges. The pilot septage treatment plant&#13;
(200 m3/d) would be located at Dagat-Dagatan. It would chemically separate the liquid and solid&#13;
components of septage, aerate the liquid portion in existing oxidation ponds, and dewater the&#13;
solid portion which would be disposed in the San Mateo sanitary landfill. Upgrading of the&#13;
Central sewerage system would include repairing defective pipes and pumping stations and&#13;
minimizing the entry of rain water to the system; at Ayala, the pumping station and sedimentation&#13;
tanks would be repaired to provide mechanical treatment. New sewer connections would increase&#13;
the population served by the Central system by about 80,000. The SSD would be strengthened&#13;
with specialized equipment for sewer cleaning, vehicles, tools and spare parts; the MWSS central&#13;
laboratory would obtain instruments to modernize operations. A detailed description of the&#13;
project is in Annex 2, and the locations of the works are shown on map IBRD No. 27244.&#13;
Status of Preparation&#13;
3.7   Detailed designs and draft bidding documents for the project were completed in January&#13;
1995 by MWSS, assisted by the Original Engineering Consultants (Japan) and DCCD&#13;
(Philippines), retained by MWSS and financed under the Japanese Grant Fund. MWSS would&#13;
arrange for minor modification and completion of the documents, including environmental&#13;
management plans.&#13;
Cost Estimate&#13;
3.8   Project cost is estimated at P 1,906 million (US$76.2 million). The foreign currency&#13;
requirement is estimated at P 697 million (US$27.9 million) or 37% of the total. Base costs&#13;
reflect end-1995 price levels. Physical contingencies are estimated at US$3.0 million, or 5% of&#13;
base costs and price contingencies at US$12.9 million, or about 20% of base cost plus physical&#13;
contingencies and assume the following annual rates of inflation: for local costs 7% for 1995,&#13;
6.5% for 1996, 6% for 1997, 5.5% for 1998 and 5% for 1999-2000; and for foreign costs 2.6%&#13;
for 1995 and thereafter. Exchange rates have been adjusted to reflect purchasing power parity on&#13;
the basis of inflation rates for local and foreign costs.&#13;
3.9   The total cost of implementation support is estimated at US$10.9 million representing&#13;
about 3,200 person months of which about 1,930 person months would be the cost of&#13;
construction supervision, environmental monitoring and management assistance, about 890&#13;
person months would be the cost of detailed engineering designs of the follow-up expansion of&#13;
sewerage system and septage treatment plants, and about 380 person months would be the cost of&#13;
preparing documents for the Manila Water Supply III project. The input of national consultants is&#13;
estimated at 3,030 person months while the expatriate input is estimated at 170 person months.&#13;
The cost estimates prepared by the consultants, based on similar works undertaken in recent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
years, were found satisfactory during appraisal. They are shown in Annex 3 and summarized in&#13;

Financing Plan&#13;
3.10 The proposed Bank loan of US$57.0 million equivalent would finance about 75% of the&#13;
total project cost or 100% of the foreign exchange requirements and 60% of local costs. The&#13;
remaining US$19.2 million or 25% of the total project cost would be financed by MWSS from&#13;
internal cash generation (Table 3.2). Retroactive financing equal to US$300,000 is recommended&#13;
for expenses incurred after July 15, 1995, to reimburse MWSS for the cost of consulting services&#13;
prior to loan signing on the basis of advanced contracting to be approved by the Bank. The&#13;
financing plan was confirmed at negotiations. The borrower would be MWSS and the Republic of&#13;
the Philippines would be the guarantor. The proposed Bank loan would be for 20 years, including&#13;
five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;

Implementation&#13;
3.11  The project would be implemented by MWSS and carried out by contractors. The bulk of&#13;
the implementation is expected between June 1996 and December 1999. Construction of new&#13;
facilities, rehabilitation works and sewer connections would be executed by four civil work supply&#13;
and install contracts supervised by the MWSS Construction Section. The collection of septage&#13;
and its disposal would be managed by SSD and carried out under three contracts, one for each&#13;
barge loading station; each of these contracts would combine the collection from a defined area&#13;
with sea disposal, the activities to be carried out by private contractors. Pilot operation of the&#13;
septage treatment plant at Dagat-Dagatan would be carried out by SSD staff. Collection and&#13;
evaluation of data on septic tanks, on characteristics of septage and on pilot operation would be&#13;
managed by the MWSS Applied Research and Quality Control Department.&#13;
3.12  The MWSS implementing units would be assisted by consultants, to be appointed for four&#13;
years starting September 1996. The consultants duties would include (a) supervising contractor&#13;
compliance with specifications for new works and goods, adhering to construction schedules,&#13;
testing and commissioning completed works; (b) supervising contractor compliance with&#13;
specifications for septage collection, transportation and sea disposal; (c) monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of septage management; and (d) advising on training of staff to operate completed&#13;
facilities. Outline terms of reference are attached with the project implementation action plan&#13;
prepared by MWSS and appraised and accepted by the Bank in July 1995. In December 1996&#13;
MWSS would also establish an advisory panel of technical, institutional, and management&#13;
specialists to assist in guiding the pilot treatment operations and evaluating them in relation to the&#13;
designs of future septage treatment plants. At negotiations, it was confirmed that the Government&#13;
will arrange for periodic independent audit of the monitoring and evaluation system (see para 38,&#13;
Annex 7). The project implementation organization is shown in Chart 3.&#13;
3.13   Septage collection, barging at Napindan and Estero de Vitas loading stations, and sea&#13;
disposal are expected to begin in January 1997; the Paranaque barge loading station is expected to&#13;
operate from May 1999. The Dagat-Dagatan treatment plant is expected to start pilot operations&#13;
in January 1998. The rehabilitation and upgrading of the Central and Ayala sewerage networks&#13;
and the Ayala treatment plant is expected to start in January 1997 and be completed in December&#13;
1998. Preparation of designs and bidding documents for septage treatment plants to be built as&#13;
part of the second phase of the septage management plan (para 3.2) is expected to be carried out&#13;
from January 1998 through December 1999. The implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4.&#13;
At negotiations, MWSS confirmed adherence to the project implementation action plan defining&#13;
the scope and timing of actions needed to carry out the project successfully. The action plan is&#13;
available in the project file and is summarized in Annex 5. MWSS has experience with much&#13;
larger contracts for civil works and equiptnent installation than contemplated under the proposed&#13;
project, and the proposed schedule for the septage management component is considered realistic;&#13;
however, the sewer system rehabilitation component may encounter delays due to permissions&#13;
required in connection with excavation works in MM.&#13;
Land Lease And Acquisition&#13;
3.14  The units to be built under the project include the pilot septage treatment plant, which&#13;
would be located next to the Dagat Dagatan oxidation ponds on MWSS land, and two of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
barge loading stations, which would entail the use of existing facilities to be leased together with a&#13;
plot of land from DPWH. Only minor additions would be made to the latter for protection against&#13;
septage spill and for washing tankers and parking areas. Execution of the lease agreement&#13;
between DPWH and MWSS would be a condition for loan effectiveness. The third loading&#13;
station, to be constructed in 1998, would be located on land to be reclaimed in Manila Bay and&#13;
procured by MWSS when the reclamation is completed. All other rehabilitation-works would be&#13;
located on MWSS land so that no land acquisition or population relocation would be required by&#13;
the project.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.15  Procurement would be carried out in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines under&#13;
]BRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995 (1996 reprint). Civil works for three&#13;
geographically distributed barge loading stations (US$1.6 million), unlikely to be of interest to&#13;
foreign bidders, would be procured through national competitive bidding procedures acceptable&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
3.16  Civil works for construction of the pilot septage treatment plant and all rehabilitation&#13;
works (US$49.3 million) would be procured through international competitive bidding following&#13;
pre-qualification of bidders and using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD). ICB&#13;
procedures and SBD would also be used for procuring the bulk of maintenance and laboratory&#13;
materials and equipment (US$7.7 million). Materials and equipment packaged in individual&#13;
contracts that do not exceed US$200,000 each or US$1.0 million in aggregate amount, would be&#13;
procured through NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank.  For procurement under ICB&#13;
procedures, domestic goods would be allowed a preference margin of 15% of C.I.F. bid price or&#13;
the amount of customs duties, whichever is lower for bid evaluation. Procurement arrangements&#13;
are summarized in Table 3.3.&#13;
3.17  The three major civil works contracts that comprise the bulk of procurement (US$49.3&#13;
million) would include supply and installation of electrical and mechanical equipment. The&#13;
contracts and estimated costs are: (a) construction of Dagat Dagatan septage treatment plant&#13;
(US$15.9 million); (b) rehabilitation of Ayala sewerage network and wastewater treatment plant&#13;
(US$11.4 million), and (c) rehabilitation of Central sewerage system (US$22.1 million).&#13;
3.18  Consultants to assist with supervision of construction, management and monitoring of&#13;
septage operation, and various studies and designs (US$10.9 million) would be selected in&#13;
accordance with the Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers using the&#13;
Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services. Due to a tight project schedule,&#13;
MWSS intends to employ a firm of consultants to help with minor modifications of bidding&#13;
documents completed earlier, finalize environmental management plans for all components, and&#13;
assist with starting the bidding process (para 3.7). Advanced contracting for these services,&#13;
estimated in total at US$150,000, would be carried out in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
3.19  Prior Bank review would be mandatory for civil works contracts estimated to cost more&#13;
than US$5.0 million, and contracts for goods estimated to cost more than US$1.0 million. This&#13;
would cover about 90% of the value of the goods contracts and about 95% of the value of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
civil works contracts. All other contracts would be subject to Bank post review procedures. All&#13;
consultancy contracts will be subject to prior review except for those estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$100,000 for employment of consulting firms or US$50,000 for employment of individuals.&#13;
For the exceptions, prior Bank review shall be required for terms of reference for such contracts,&#13;
sole source procurement, assignments of critical nature, and amendments to contracts raising their&#13;
value above the threshold limits.&#13;

Disbursement&#13;
3.20   The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed against: (a) 100%  of foreign&#13;
expenditure for civil works; (b) 50% of local expenditure for civil works; (c) 100% of local&#13;
expenditure (ex-factory) for locally manufactured equipment and materials, or 65% of local&#13;
expenditure for other equipment and materials procured locally, and (d) 100% of total&#13;
expenditure for consultant services, training and studies. An amount of US$300,000 would&#13;
retroactively reimburse expenditure for consulting services incurred after July 15, 1995.&#13;
3.21   Disbursements would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOE) for&#13;
actual expenditures against: (a) contracts of less than US$5.0 million equivalent for civil works,&#13;
(b) contracts of less than US$1.0 million equivalent for goods, and (c) consultant's contracts of&#13;
less than US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000 equivalent for individuals. Supporting&#13;
documentation for these expenditures would be retained by MWSS, made available for review by&#13;
Bank supervision missions, and regularly audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.22  To facilitate loan disbursement, MWSS may, for purposes of the project, open and&#13;
maintain in dollars a special deposit account (Account) in a commercial bank specifically&#13;
authorized for this purpose by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas on terms and conditions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, including appropriate protection against set-off, seizure or attachment.&#13;
The Account which would cover the Bank's share of eligible expenditures in all disbursement&#13;
categories would have an authorized allocation of US$2.0 million to be withdrawn from the Loan&#13;
Account and deposited in the Account, provided, however, that unless the Bank would otherwise&#13;
agree the authorized allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to US$1.0 million until&#13;
disbursements and outstanding commitments against the loan equal or exceed the equivalent of&#13;
US$10.0 million. Applications for replenishment of the Account, supported by documentation,&#13;
would be submitted regularly (not less than quarterly) or when the amount withdrawn equaled&#13;
50% of the initial deposit. During negotiations agreement was reached whereby MWSS would&#13;
establish and hold the Special Account in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bangko Sentral ng&#13;
Pilipinas and IBRD.&#13;
3.23  Project implementation would extend over six years, starting from September 1996. All&#13;
major works would be substantially completed on December 31, 1999. To allow for completion&#13;
of studies and rehabilitation works, which may experience delays, the loan will be closed on&#13;
December 31, 2001. A schedule of estimated disbursements as well as a profile of disbursement&#13;
under previous Bank-assisted water and sewerage projects is shown in Annex 6.&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
3.24  The project would have a marked net positive environmental impact by: (a) reducing the&#13;
level of human exposure to raw wastewater, with public health benefits; (b) reducing organic&#13;
pollution of MM waterways and Manila Bay, and protecting groundwater from contamination,&#13;
and (c) increasing MWSS capacity to control pollution. The project has an Environmental&#13;
Category A rating because of sea disposal of septage but no adverse impact on the marine&#13;
environment is expected (para 3.27). Relatively minor potential negative effects include: (a)&#13;
traffic and noise during construction; (b) increased levels of noise and odor during septage&#13;
collection and shipping and operation of the pilot treatment plant, and (c) possible accidental or&#13;
improper discharge of septage. Mitigating actions to limit these and possibly other negative&#13;
impacts are identified in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Supplementary Reports&#13;
and would be implemented during project execution. Public consultations would be held as&#13;
appropriate. No relocation of population is required by the project.&#13;
3.25  MWSS has submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the project to the&#13;
Bank and complied with information disclosure and public consultation requirements. The&#13;
documents were distributed to the Bank's Public Information Center and the EIA summary was&#13;
made available to the Board on June 2, 1995. In July 1995 MWSS also submitted to the Bank a&#13;
supplementary EIA report containing outlines of environmental management plan (EMP) for each&#13;
project component. In response to comments from the Bank and EMB, a revised supplementary&#13;
EIA report was submitted in December 1995. During project implementation, the environmental&#13;
impact of each component would be monitored separately in accordance with the detailed EMPs&#13;
(see Table A 7-2 for schedule). At negotiations, assurances were obtained that MWSS would (a)&#13;
agree to completion of the detailed EMPs according to schedule, (b) submit annually, starting&#13;
from December 31, 1996, a report summarizing the results of monitoring the compliance with the&#13;
EMPs, and (c) submit annually, starting from June 1997, a report containing the independent audit&#13;
of the septage management operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
3.26  In accordance with national environmental regulations, MWSS also submitted the project&#13;
EIA to the Philippine EMB for review. The receipt by MWSS of Environmental Compliance&#13;
Certificates (ECC) for collection, barging and sea disposal; Dagat-Dagatan pilot septage&#13;
treatment plant; and rehabilitation of the Central and Ayala sewerage systems and Ayala treatment&#13;
plant would be a condition for loan effectiveness.&#13;
3.27   The project would (a) reduce the BOD loading of the rivers and shoreline of Manila Bay&#13;
by an estimated 30%, and (b) improve sanitary conditions within the project area, extending to&#13;
about 15 km2, thus reducing the level of human exposure to raw wastewater and improving&#13;
public health. It is estimated that from the total residential water pollution load of 390 t/d of&#13;
BOD about 30% or 130 t/d of BOD would be removed from MM's waterways by effective&#13;
performance of existing septic tanks and improved Central and Ayala sewerage systems. The&#13;
Bank engaged an independent outside expert to visit the Philippines and evaluate the likelihood&#13;
that deep sea disposal of septage might have an adverse impact on the marine environment. The&#13;
expert concluded that on the basis of internationally available data, the environmental risk in the&#13;
sea disposal of septage is minimal. This is due to both the relatively low levels of contaminants in&#13;
septage, and the exceptionally high dispersion characteristics of the disposal site, which is more&#13;
than 40 km from the nearest shoreline. Against this insignificant risk, the accelerated collection&#13;
and sea disposal of septage will give rise to significant and measurable benefits in the Pasig River&#13;
and inner Manila Bay. The expert's report is available in the project file.&#13;
3.28   The sea disposal option was selected after extensive studies and evaluation of alternatives,&#13;
including disposal in the 'lahar" lava remaining from the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, incineration,&#13;
and dewatering in combination with disposal in sanitary landfills, all in the context of the short&#13;
time frame of several years for which the interim disposal site is needed to obtain basic data for&#13;
designing land-based permanent treatment of septage. In addition to being the least-cost solution&#13;
among the above alternatives, sea disposal presents an advantage in requiring relatively minor&#13;
investments in permanent structures, as almost all costs are recurrent, and it allows disposal - with&#13;
its important benefits for the urban environment - to begin quickly. Sea disposal also provides&#13;
operational flexibility to increase, decrease, or completely stop the collection and disposal of&#13;
septage without the serious impact on operations that would occur using any other technology.&#13;
3.29  The identified sea disposal site is one of eight waste disposal sites designated by the&#13;
Philippine Coast Guard in 1991 in accordance with the London Convention2. The site is located&#13;
approximately 115 km from the barging stations, outside normal fishing grounds, about 20 km off&#13;
the nearest navigation lane, with ocean depth about 2,300 m. During November to March, the&#13;
current flows westward away from the shores; from May to October, under the influence of the&#13;
strong southerly wind, it moves towards Luzon's west shores in a north to north-easterly&#13;
direction, the typical travel time to the nearest shore being approximately ten days. Confirmation&#13;
of the environmental impact of sea-dumping through a mathematical model prepared by an&#13;
independent consultant would be a condition of loan effectiveness. Barging frequency is estimated&#13;
at 240 days a year, taking into account non-navigable conditions and mitigating reasons. The&#13;
combined collection and disposal contracts would allow cessation of septage collection during&#13;
periods of inclement weather thereby obviating the need for storage facilities. The proposed&#13;
2 The 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by dumping waste and other matter was held in London on&#13;
29 December 1972, entered into force on 30 August 1975 and was amended in October 1978, September 1980, and&#13;
November 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
monitoring and mitigating actions, revised in December, 1995, are summarized in Annex 7 and&#13;
considered to be satisfactory.&#13;
3.30  Possible negative effects identified in the EIA report include increased levels of dust,&#13;
noise, odor, traffic and water pollution during: (a) construction and operation of the pilot STP;&#13;
(b) collection of septage, and (c) sea dumping. These impacts would be mitigated through proper&#13;
design and installation of pollution control facilities, and effective implementation of an&#13;
environmental management plan, including provision of enclosed, ventilated buildings with&#13;
deodorizing equipment for transfer activities; installing buffer zones or noise barriers; using&#13;
vacuum trucks to collect septage; limiting working hours and vehicle speed; installing traffic&#13;
signals; providing tow trucks; and monitoring environmental quality. Dewatered sludge will be&#13;
disposed of at San Mateo sanitary landfill. Mitigating measures are included in detailed designs&#13;
and contract documents.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
3.31   The proposed project would be supervised semi-annually in the field to review&#13;
implementation progress, technical matters, construction quality, compliance with loan covenants,&#13;
and environmental requirements, and to discuss relevant matters with the Government and&#13;
implementing agencies. A mid-term review would be organized in October 1998 to evaluate&#13;
project implementation, tariff status and compliance with the EMP. The sea disposal of septage&#13;
would be evaluated at this review based on the results of the monitoring program and the need to&#13;
adhere to the cessation timetable of 2003 would be reassessed. Activities at headquarters would&#13;
involve reviewing progress reports and procurement actions and preparing various project-related&#13;
correspondence. Supervision would require about 58 staff-weeks over the life of the project, of&#13;
which about 30 staff-weeks would be in Washington and 28 staff-weeks in the field. Supervision&#13;
would require expertise in sanitary engineering, water and air pollution control, environmental&#13;
issues and financial analysis.&#13;
3.32 MWSS would forward to the Bank semi-annual progress reports, various annual&#13;
environmental, financial and audit reports, and an evaluation report on project implementation&#13;
within six months of project completion (para 5.21). The proposed supervision plan as well as&#13;
outlines of progress reports, water quality status report and the evaluation report are shown in&#13;
Annex 8. At negotiations, the format and content of these reports were agreed with MWSS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
4. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY&#13;
Implementing Organization&#13;
4.1   The project would be implemented jointly by MWSS Construction, which would employ&#13;
and supervise respective contractors, MWSS Engineering, which would collect and evaluate data&#13;
on septage and guide environmental monitoring, and MWSS Operations, which would employ&#13;
and supervise contractors to collect and dispose of the septage. The SSD would operate the&#13;
facilities after construction of the septage treatment plant and rehabilitation of sewer networks. A&#13;
project management office would be established within Engineering to coordinate project&#13;
implementation. MWSS has carried out similar activities and is experienced in implementing this&#13;
type of project.&#13;
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System&#13;
4.2   MWSS is a government corporation established by charter in 1971 to develop, operate&#13;
and maintain water supply, sewerage, and sanitation systems in and around MM. MWSS has&#13;
non-profit status and is exempt from most taxes and duties. MWSS also has some quasi-&#13;
regulatory functions, including setting bylaws relevant to its service functions. The MWSS Board&#13;
has the power to set tariffs and ratify its budget after it is approved by the Office of the President.&#13;
Like all government-owned corporations, MWSS is subject to: (a) NEDA approval of its&#13;
investments; (b) a rate-of-return limit of 12%; (c) civil service employment rules and salary&#13;
structures, and (d) public sector procurement rules.&#13;
Organizational Structure&#13;
4.3   Corporate powers and functions are vested in a Board of Trustees appointed by the&#13;
President of the Philippines. The ex-officio Chairman of the Board is the Secretary of DPWH.&#13;
The chief executive of the corporation, the administrator, is also appointed directly by the&#13;
President.  The administrator is assisted by a senior deputy administrator, six deputy&#13;
administrators (DA) responsible for engineering, construction, operations, customer services,&#13;
finance, and administration, and the corporate planning and management information systems&#13;
groups. Some customer service functions (metering, billing, collection, and minor leak repair) are&#13;
decentralized to eight geographical customer service sectors reporting to DA customer services.&#13;
The MWSS organization structure is shown in Chart 1.&#13;
4.4   The SSD, under the deputy administrator for operations, is responsible for sewerage and&#13;
sanitation services.  The department has three divisions: operation and maintenance; sewer&#13;
connection extension and field investigation, and septic tank maintenance. Its organization is&#13;
shown in Chart 2.&#13;
Staffing and Training&#13;
4.5   In 1995 there were 6,954 MWSS employees, including 2,154 casual workers. MWSS is&#13;
overstaffed compared to similar utilities elsewhere; the number of water-related employees per&#13;
thousand water connections is 7.5 compared to 5.5 for the Bangkok Metropolitan Waterworks&#13;
Authority, while the number of sewerage-related employees per thousand sewerage connections is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
5.1, which is satisfactory.  Employees are remunerated under the general civil service&#13;
salary/benefits scale. MWSS contracts out some services, including delivery of water bills and&#13;
collection of payments, and regular desludging of septic tanks. Recently, the corporation has&#13;
begun contracting out some distribution system leak repairs.&#13;
4.6   MWSS conducts in-house training in most technical areas relevant to its activities, and&#13;
managerial and personnel development training. It also conducts an annual exchange of staff with&#13;
the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority of Bangkok.&#13;
Performance and Management&#13;
4.7   Most financial parameters continue to indicate adequate performance. In relation to&#13;
comparable utilities, its rate of return on assets and billing efficiency are high, and tariffs are&#13;
average. However, service delivery is an area of concern. While the quality of water is good,&#13;
pressure is low with frequent shortages and a significant percentage of the population remains&#13;
unserved or underserved. Sewer service coverage is very low, and most septic tanks have never&#13;
been desludged. The most financially threatening problem continues to be the high proportion of&#13;
non-revenue water (NRW). After declining through the late 1970s from around 50% to around&#13;
46% it has risen to an estimated 55% to 60% of production as new capacity has come on stream.&#13;
This, and other evidence of premature decay of capital equipment, indicates deficient&#13;
maintenance. MWSS plans to reduce NRW to 30% by the 2000 through major investments in&#13;
network rehabilitation and renovation. Data for the first seven months of 1995 show an NRW&#13;
decrease of 1% a month - to 53% in July - through intensive leak repairs.&#13;
Development Programs&#13;
4.8   MWSS needs to make major capital investments in the near future to reduce the&#13;
population without water and sanitation services, improve the unsatisfactory state of its facilities,&#13;
and address significant environmental problems. While investment alternatives have been studied,&#13;
adequate attention has yet to be given to their financing and management requirements.&#13;
Institutional Issues&#13;
4.9   While major capital investments are required, the very high level of NRW threatens the&#13;
viability of future investments. While lack of maintenance over a prolonged period is the&#13;
proximate cause of the situation, MWSS has not yet clearly identified the roots of its maintenance&#13;
problems.  Efforts to improve performance have focused on computerization to generate&#13;
management information, and training and capacity building to improve personnel skills; these do&#13;
not seem to have made a significant difference in improving key performance indicators, in&#13;
particular NRW. The Water Supply and Sewerage Master Plan completed in early 1996 includes&#13;
an institutional analysis to determine the underlying causes of the unsatisfactory performance and&#13;
suggest changes to enable the agency to successfully finance, build, and - most importantly -&#13;
maintain its facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Private Sector Involvement&#13;
4.10  MWSS is considering a number of unsolicited proposals for increased private sector&#13;
participation in its operations. Most of these pertain to water supply; expressions of private sector&#13;
interest involve offers for investments in source development and water treatment plants on a&#13;
build-operate-transfer basis. There has been one limited proposal for private participation in&#13;
operating a part of the sewerage system. Recently, MWSS, with strong support from the&#13;
Government, has initiated studies, with the IFC as the lead advisor, to evaluate private&#13;
participation in the form of concessions to improve service levels and reduce NRW. Septic tank&#13;
desludging has been carried out by private contractors employed by MWSS and is to be greatly&#13;
expanded under the proposed project. The proposed project is compatible with a privatization&#13;
scenario, as septage collection and disposal will be bid out to private contractors.&#13;
4.11    The exact scope of the proposed concession arrangements for MWSS have not been&#13;
determined as yet. Responsibility for investment in and operation of the sewerage and sanitation&#13;
systems could be completely transferred to the private concessionaire or shared in some way with&#13;
the national Government, the newly formed MMDA and local government units. At negotiations,&#13;
the Government confirmed that in the event of changes in the responsibility for providing&#13;
sewerage and sanitation services in MM from MWSS to another entity during implementation of&#13;
the project, it would consult the Bank prior to undertaking any such changes or restructuring.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
4.12  SSD's resources and organization are adequate to implement the proposed project, except&#13;
for the need to train the management and operational staff of the pilot septage treatment plant. Its&#13;
engineering department would provide the research support required during implementation of the&#13;
pilot phase for collecting and evaluating data needed to design the subsequent phase of the&#13;
septage management plan. It would coordinate with agencies involved in water pollution control,&#13;
such as the Pasig River Committee, and be assisted by consultants and professionally guided by an&#13;
advisory panel (para 3.12).&#13;
4.13  Land-based disposal of treated sludge would be required for the first time after operations&#13;
begin in the pilot septage treatment plant, scheduled for 1998. The functions of the existing&#13;
disposal and contract service section of SSD septic tank maintenance division would need to be&#13;
expanded and staff trained to adequately undertake the new activity. The training would be&#13;
provided by the suppliers of equipment and would be included in contract documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
Planning and Budgeting&#13;
5.1   MWSS annual budgets are approved by its Board subject to approval by the Office of the&#13;
President. The operational expenditure budget for sewerage operations is prepared by SSD.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that MWSS would prepare separate budgets for&#13;
SSD, including income statements and balance sheets for FY97 and thereafter. In addition to&#13;
annual budgets, the MWSS corporate planning group (CORPLAN) makes ten-year investment,&#13;
financial and operational projections.&#13;
Rate Structure and Revenues&#13;
5.2   CORPLAN reviews the adequacy of water supply and sewerage charges each year. Its&#13;
policy for tariff formulation considers the actual costs of operations and maintenance, including&#13;
depreciation, and estimated future costs, plus a rate of return on net fixed assets in operation of at&#13;
least 8% to provide for improvement and expansion of the systems, and a margin to ensure&#13;
perpetuation of the organization. The review, including requests for tariff increases, is submitted&#13;
to the Board for approval.&#13;
5.3   All customers connected to MWSS water supply are metered and billed at progressive&#13;
block rates. There are residential, commercial, and industrial bands. The residential bands have&#13;
nine blocks ranging between 10 and 100 m3/month, and commercial and industrial users have&#13;
three blocks ranging from 25 to over 100 m3/month. Metered water supply is used as the base&#13;
for calculating sewerage and environmental charges. The sewerage charge - 50% of the water bill&#13;
- is levied on consumers with sewer connections to cover costs of operation and maintenance of&#13;
sewerage systems. An environmental charge of 10% is levied on all water supply bills to cover&#13;
the cost of desludging septic tanks and other environmental protection measures.&#13;
5.4   Residential consumers pay 30% less than the average charge per/m3, while commercial&#13;
and industrial consumers pay 45% and 70% respectively above the average. A significant subsidy,&#13;
therefore, is provided to residential customers, with the greatest benefit going to low-consuming,&#13;
low-income households. During 1996, both the MM water supply and sewerage master plan&#13;
study and the IFC-led privatization initiative are expected to recommend changes in the MWSS&#13;
tariff structure and levels, including charges for sewerage services.&#13;
5.5   Over 1989-92 MWSS increased water and sewerage and environmental charges in line&#13;
with annual inflation, but the Board has not approved an increase since May 1992. In December,&#13;
1995, MWSS management submitted a request to its Board for a raise in the average water tariff&#13;
from the current P 6.43/m3 to P 8.78/m3. SSD needs the revenues from this increase (arising&#13;
from accompanying sewerage and environmental charges) to carry out its sewerage system&#13;
development plans (Para. 5.18). Implementation of this water tariff increase, including indexed&#13;
sewerage tariff and environmental charges would be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
5.6   To compensate for revaluation of the peso against a basket of international currencies,&#13;
MWSS introduced an automatic currency exchange rate adjustment (CERA) in 1984 that tracks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
MWSS's foreign debt service per cubic meter of water sold against 1984 reference values. The&#13;
CERA surcharge is equivalent to 15% of the current average tariff.&#13;
Accounting and Auditing&#13;
5.7   MWS S's accrual-based accounting procedures are generally satisfactory and are set by the&#13;
Commission on Audit (COA), a separate constitutional body. Sewerage system accounts have&#13;
been separated from water transactions since 1988. The SSD bank account pays direct operating&#13;
expenses, while other costs are apportioned at the end of each month between the two services&#13;
using an inter-fund receivable/payable account. During negotiations, assurances were obtained&#13;
that, commencing from FY97, cash transfer of the difference between the water and sewerage&#13;
inter-fund receivable and payable accounts would be made at the end of each quarter, and the&#13;
account closed at each year end. Billing, collections and payroll are computerized, and MWSS is&#13;
transferring the balance of its accounting procedures, including SSD, to a new computerized&#13;
system which is expected to be in operation by the end of 1996. Project accounts would be kept&#13;
by the finance office.&#13;
5.8   MWSS accounts, including for SSD, are audited by COA, and in recent years there have&#13;
been no qualifications with significant implications for the financial statements. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the financial statements of MWSS, including separate&#13;
ones for SSD, will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. These statements&#13;
and audit reports would also include a separate opinion on the Statement of Expenditures and the&#13;
Special Account for the Bank loan, and would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the&#13;
close of each fiscal year.&#13;
Billing and Collection&#13;
5.9   Customers are charged for water supply and sewerage services on a combined&#13;
computerized monthly bill. At the end of 1994 there were 824,460 customer accounts, 90,510 of&#13;
which had sewerage connections. Meter reading is done by the eight decentralized sectors, and&#13;
the results are forwarded to the computer services center at the head office, which prepares bills&#13;
and maintains the accounts receivable ledger. Bills are hand-delivered by contract collection&#13;
agents employed by customer services, who also collect payments from customers. Bills can also&#13;
be paid directly to MWSS branch offices, and customers are required to pay within ten days of&#13;
delivery. If bills are unpaid after one month, enforcement action, including disconnection, may be&#13;
taken.&#13;
5.10  The present method for processing collections is based on an 'bpen-item" system under&#13;
which receipts are matched to bills before posting to the accounts receivable ledger. This creates&#13;
delays of up to six months in updating the ledger, however, and MWSS recognizes that the&#13;
system is inadequate and fails to provide timely, accurate information. A new computerized&#13;
billing and accounts receivable system is being prepared for staged introduction in the eight&#13;
sectors between September 1995 and March 1996. Bills showing total amounts due, including&#13;
arrears, should improve debt collection.&#13;
5.11  The net realizable value of accounts receivable is a problem area for MWSS. At the end&#13;
of 1994 it equaled 110 days of S SD's sales, which is unsatisfactory. Assurances were obtained&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
from MWSS that, commencing from FY96, its net accounts receivable would not exceed 90 days&#13;
of billing. The accounts receivable ledger was last reconciled in 1990. The new billing and&#13;
accounts receivable system will have reconciled and up-to-date customer balances transferred to&#13;
the new system during its introduction. The bad debt provision for 1994 was 2%, which will also&#13;
be reviewed when balances are transferred to the new system.&#13;
MWSS Financial Performance&#13;
5.12  The audited financial performance of MWSS covering all its activities related to water&#13;
supply and sewerage indicate a satisfactory financial position from 1990 through 1994. Revenues&#13;
increased by 10% a year, and expenses by 14.8%, over the same period. While net income&#13;
steadily increased until 1992, a slight decline in 1993 was mainly caused by an increase in financial&#13;
charges; the decline continued in 1994 because of a jump in interest charges and non-cash&#13;
expenses, mainly higher depreciation, following the revaluation of assets. Although operating&#13;
results deteriorated in 1994, there was a net income before taxes of P 667.24 million equivalent to&#13;
18% of total revenues generated for the year, with a rate of return of 8%. Since 1990, total assets&#13;
have grown at 9% a year, mainly due to an increase in fixed assets from capital works projects.&#13;
The current financial position is considered satisfactory.&#13;
5.13  Financial ratios similarly indicate adequate performance, with the current ratio ranging&#13;
between 4.3 and 5.0 suggesting that MWSS has been very liquid; the operating ratio has averaged&#13;
55%, and the debt equity ratio has ranged between 41% and 48%. Cash flow, however, has been&#13;
a problem due to increased debt-service payments. In 1994 MWSS's long term debt was P 8.39&#13;
billion, with a debt service ratio of 1.23%. A financial status study of MWSS prepared by&#13;
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in November 1993, and comparative financial statements for the 1990-&#13;
94 period, are available in the project file.&#13;
SSD Financial Performance&#13;
5.14  SSD's financial performance since 1988, when records started to be kept separately from&#13;
water, has resulted in net operational surpluses each year. Since 1992, operational revenues have&#13;
increased by 15% due to higher water volumes, and operational costs increased by only 3%.&#13;
Other financial ratios are generally satisfactory, with a current ratio of 3.0 and an operating ratio&#13;
at 47%. These results have, however, reflected less than adequate operation and maintenance,&#13;
due to slow procurement procedures and cash restraints, and much of SSD's plant and equipment&#13;
is in a poor state. Cash flow continues to be a major problem due to debt service obligations and&#13;
failure to achieve revenue targets. SSD's total debt at the end of 1994 was P 820 million, with a&#13;
debt service ratio of 1.5. SSD comparative financial statements for the 1990 to 1994 period are&#13;
available in the project file.&#13;
5.15  SSD internal cash generation and loans finance capital projects and operations.  The&#13;
revenue earning capacity of the sewerage charge, however, will always be limited to the number&#13;
of customers connected to the sewer network, while the environmental charge grows in direct&#13;
proportion to the growth in water revenue. The sewerage charge on its own is insufficient to fund&#13;
all SSD's costs, and the environmental charge is, therefore, used to support sewerage operations&#13;
and service foreign loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Project Financing&#13;
5.16  SSD's capital spending requirements and financial plan for 1995-99 are shown in Table&#13;
5. 1, and include the commencement of the proposed third sewerage project. The Bank loan of&#13;
US$57 million equivalent would finance 30% of SSD's financial requirements over the period.&#13;
The SSD financial plan was confirmed during negotiations.&#13;

5.17  SSD financial projections are shown in Annex 10, and the assumptions used to prepare&#13;
them in Annex 11. One of the goals of the project is to improve SSD performance; accordingly,&#13;
MWSS has prepared operation and maintenance guidelines for its sewerage system as a basis for&#13;
establishing adequate annual budget allocations and evaluating SSD performance.&#13;
5.18  To achieve internal contribution targets for the proposed development of the sewerage&#13;
system, it will be necessary to double SSD's revenues from P 616 million achieved in 1994 to P&#13;
1,367 million by the end of the implementation period in 1999. The projected increase in&#13;
revenues is based on assumed annual tariff increases and reductions in NRW as outlined in Annex&#13;
10.&#13;
5.19  During negotiations, assurances were obtained that MWSS would take all necessary&#13;
measures, including adjustments of the structure or levels of sewerage rates, to produce, for each&#13;
fiscal year starting in 1996, funds from SSD's internal sources equivalent to not less than 25% of&#13;
SSD's annual average capital expenditure.&#13;
5.20  To ensure payment of debt service obligations related to sewerage activities, assurances&#13;
were obtained that MWSS would not incur any debt for its sewerage activity unless a reasonable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
forecast of SSD's estimated net revenues for each fiscal year during the term of the debt to be&#13;
incurred is at least 1.2 times the estimate of sewerage activity debt service requirements.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
5.21  Performance would be monitored against the implementation schedule (Annex 4) and the&#13;
project implementation action plan (Annex 5).  The implementation agency's operational,&#13;
financial, and management performance will be assessed against monitoring indicators (Annex&#13;
11). During negotiations, assurances were obtained that MWSS would submit to the Bank (a) no&#13;
later than March 31 and September 30 of each project year, commencing on September 30, 1996,&#13;
semi-annual project progress reports, including revised project cost estimates and implementing&#13;
schedules, (b) no later than March 31 of each pr'oject year, commencing on March 31, 1997,&#13;
SSD's annual updated financial projections, and (c) no later than six months after completion of&#13;
the project the evaluation report on project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
6.1   The proposed project includes the following components: (a) a pilot septage management&#13;
program, which will test out options for improving the management of the approximately 1&#13;
million septic tanks constructed through private financing in MN, (b) rehabilitation of the existing&#13;
sewer infrastructure, and (c) addition of 10,000 new house connections to the existing sewer&#13;
system. The benefits from these programs will be in the form of abatement of fecal contamination&#13;
around MM households and in neighborhood drains and canals. While most of these benefits are&#13;
not easily quantifiable, the impacts of such investments in terms of public health and&#13;
environmental improvements are known to be significant.&#13;
6.2   Owing to the lack of prior experience in septage management, there is a need to test out&#13;
options on a pilot basis before a full-scale septage management plan can be implemented. The&#13;
pilot program tests out how best incentive structures and investments can be matched with each&#13;
other so that septage is collected, conveyed and disposed in a sustainable and efficient manner.&#13;
The experience gained from the interim solution of desludging, barging and ocean dispersal of&#13;
septage will provide information on the number, condition, accessibility and average size of the&#13;
septic tanks and the characteristics of their content. Additional information would be gained on&#13;
how the private sector can be provided with incentives to participate in this operation. The&#13;
experience gained from construction and actual operation of a pilot septage treatment facility&#13;
through public investments is expected to provide data for optimal technological design, sizing&#13;
and location of septage treatment plants to be constructed in the future. Data from the two sub-&#13;
components together provide the basis for the development of MWSS's long-term septage&#13;
management plan.&#13;
6.3   The scale of the proposed pilot exercise is large: 300,000, or approximately a third of&#13;
MM's septic tanks would be desludged over the life of the project. This effort is expected to&#13;
substantially improve the performance of septic tanks which, with periodic desludging, function as&#13;
fairly effective instruments for pollution abatement, reducing organic pollution between 30% and&#13;
65% depending upon design, and removing up to 90% of suspended solids. Without desludging,&#13;
the performance of septic tanks is severely compromised, and a maximum of 10% BOD removal&#13;
can be expected. While the health and amenity benefits are difficult to quantify, what is clear is&#13;
that there are significant benefits in the form of reduction in fecal contamination through the&#13;
proper operation of these septic tanks.&#13;
6.4  In terms of overall scale, the approximately one million septic tanks in MM represent&#13;
household investment equivalent to a current replacement value of about US$400 million.&#13;
Without proper septage collection, conveyance and disposal, not only is this substantial private&#13;
sector investment not yielding benefits, but is aggravating public health risks by exposing MM&#13;
residents to fecal contamination at their homes and neighborhoods. The health risks are greatest&#13;
for the low-income residents, who reside in densely populated areas with poor drainage. Under&#13;
the project, a capital investment of US$14 million would restore approximately 300,000 septic&#13;
tanks to full effectiveness with significant public health benefits. Moreover, these 300,000 tanks&#13;
would be selected in the proximity of the Pasig River to maximize the impact in terms of reducing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
the pollution load in the river. Again, it is difficult to assign a monetary value to the resulting&#13;
health and aesthetic benefits.&#13;
6.5   The second project component involves rehabilitation of the Central and Ayala sewerage&#13;
systems.  These systems, with a current replacement value of US$98 million, are under-&#13;
performing due to cumulative lack of repair and maintenance. The project will invest US$17&#13;
million to restore the benefit stream from these facilities in a sustainable manner in the future.&#13;
Sustainable operation and maintenance of these systems would reduce overflow of sewage during&#13;
rain and floods in the service area, thereby resulting in positive health benefits.&#13;
6.6   The third project component would provide 10,000 new house connections to existing&#13;
sewer systems at a cost of US$10.5 million. This is the only revenue generating component in the&#13;
project and would add an estimated US$1.5 million per year to SSD revenues in current prices by&#13;
1999. Health and environmental benefits would result from the expanded coverage of the water-&#13;
borne sewer system in MM, which is presently very low.&#13;
6.7   The project aims to improve health and environmental conditions throughout MM.&#13;
However, low-income households will benefit disproportionately because they reside in the areas&#13;
covered by the pilot project. These households appear to be having some of the most poorly&#13;
maintained septic tanks in the city despite paying the monthly environmental charge to MWSS.&#13;
Rate of Return&#13;
6.8   The benefits from the project in terms of environmental improvements and better health to&#13;
residents are difficult to value in monetary terms, though the physical impacts in terms of&#13;
reduction in neighborhood fecal contamination, abatement of pollution in urban drains and water&#13;
bodies are considerable. An economic rate of return based on a full cost-benefit analysis thus&#13;
cannot be calculated for the project which is justified based on a least-cost analysis. However,&#13;
lower-bound estimates for individual project components can be computed based on the following&#13;
simplifying assumptions: (a) that existing charges levied by MWSS for sewer and sanitation&#13;
services reflect consumer willingness to pay and are a measure of total economic benefits (private&#13;
and public) to households; and (b) that without adequate maintenance and proper operation (to be&#13;
ensured through project investments), full economic benefits from existing assets are not realized&#13;
even though the tariff charges are paid in full. The first assumption is conservative, as willingness&#13;
to pay for improved services may actually be higher than existing charges, and also because&#13;
households usually undervalue public benefits. Household willingness to pay would also not&#13;
include the value of the information required to design the future sanitation system. Details of the&#13;
stylized economic rate-of-return analysis are presented in Annex 12 and some of the key finding&#13;
are summarized below.&#13;
6.9   The rate of return for new sewer connections is the simplest to compute since both costs&#13;
and revenues are well defined. The IRR is 10%, assuming that there is no increase in SSD O&amp;M&#13;
costs because of higher personnel cost (MWSS is over-staffed); the IRR falls to 4% if it is&#13;
assumed that these costs increase in proportion to the number of connections (10%).&#13;
6.10  The sewer system rehabilitation component has an economic rate of return of 8%,&#13;
assuming that without the project only half of potential economic benefits (based on SSD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
revenues as a proxy for consumer willingness to pay) are realized from existing assets and that&#13;
O&amp;M costs increase by 50% after the project to maintain the full benefit stream. The IRR falls to&#13;
4% if it is assumed that 60% of full benefits are being realized without the project.&#13;
6.11   The economic return of the septic tank maintenance component depends on the manner in&#13;
which the collected septage is disposed of If ocean dumping of septage is chosen as a permanent&#13;
disposal method, the IRR would be 12%, assuming that septic tanks without the project&#13;
investments yield only 10% of full benefits; the IRR would fall to 9% if septic tanks without the&#13;
project are assumed to yield 20% of full benefits, and to only 5% if without the project they are&#13;
assumed to yield 30% of full benefits. However, if ocean dumping of septage is chosen as an&#13;
interim solution, capital costs of the order of US$150 million and steady state recurring costs of&#13;
US$35 million per year would be needed to replace sea disposal by land-based septage treatment&#13;
plants. This represents recurring costs of approximately US$3 per household per month. Recent&#13;
studies indicate that, at the present household income levels in the Philippines, this would exceed&#13;
the willingness to pay of most households in MM for this type of service. For this reason, the&#13;
MWSS septage management plan proposes septage treatment capacity to be increased gradually&#13;
to full capacity only by 2003. By then, income levels are expected to have risen sufficiently to&#13;
enable more of the costs to be covered through user charges.&#13;
6.12  For the proposed project as a whole, the only incremental revenues are from the 10,000&#13;
new sewer connections. These revenues are not enough to cover the full costs of the project&#13;
resulting in a negative net present value. Therefore, if project implementation is justified on the&#13;
basis of its environmental and health benefits, either a subsidy from the government or a tariff&#13;
increase would be required to ensure full cost recovery for MWSS. The financial analysis shows&#13;
that a 7% increase in the water tariff would generate sufficient incremental revenues for MWSS to&#13;
cover all costs of the entire project. However, if the cost is to be recovered entirely from&#13;
incremental revenues of the SSD (i.e., from incremental sewer and environmental charges) a&#13;
larger increase in the water tariff would be needed. This follows because, while sewer and&#13;
environmental charges are indexed to the water charge, the number of sewer connections is&#13;
significantly less than the number of water connections. The analysis in Annex 12 shows that the&#13;
project breaks even with a water tariff increase of 35% if only the incremental sewer and&#13;
environmental revenues are used to defray project costs. Given that there has been no tariff&#13;
increase since May 1992, MWSS considers a water tariff increase of this magnitude to be&#13;
presently feasible and affordable.&#13;
Least-Cost Solution&#13;
6.13  The difficulties in quantifying economic benefits from environmental projects has usually&#13;
led to objectives being defined to ensure achievement of relevant externally mandated criteria&#13;
(e.g., minimum water and air quality standards) to protect public health and improve living&#13;
conditions. In MM, the Government, as part of its commitment to environmentally sustainable&#13;
development, has adopted the target of reducing the existing pollution load in terms of BOD by&#13;
20% and of significantly improving Pasig River water quality by the end of 1999. In such&#13;
situations, the least-cost criterion is the operationally relevant one in guiding the choice of feasible&#13;
technical options to achieve project objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
6.14   On-site disposal of domestic wastewater using  private septic tanks connected to&#13;
soakaways or leaching pits is not feasible in MM due to high residential density. Three technical&#13;
options can be considered for off-site disposal: (a) extension of existing separate sewer systems;&#13;
(b) conversion to combined drainage and sewer system without household septic tanks, and (c)&#13;
conversion to combined drainage and sewer system with household septic tanks. The first option&#13;
in MM is unaffordable to most households; in addition, with only 10% of the MM area covered by&#13;
water-borne sewerage the additional investment costs are prohibitively high. The second option is&#13;
feasible only if all surface drainage segments in the service area are eliminated and replaced by&#13;
sub-surface conduits; this is unlikely in the near future given the additional investment costs&#13;
required. The third option, if properly operated, is the most viable in the present situation: it&#13;
utilizes existing investments in private septic tanks; prevents untreated excreta flowing through&#13;
surface drains; and allows the possibility of upgrading the system (i.e. bypassing septic tanks when&#13;
surface drains are eliminated and interceptors installed) in the future.&#13;
6.15   Septic tank management imposes higher recurring costs than piped sewerage, as it&#13;
requires the periodic collection and disposal of the septage accumulated in septic tanks. The&#13;
collection of septage using vacuum trucks is common to all septage management options.&#13;
However, various alternatives are possible for disposal including disposal at sea, land application,&#13;
treatment at wastewater treatment plants, and independent septage treatment facilities.&#13;
6.16   All the above alternatives were considered in the project feasibility study.   Land&#13;
application was found to be cost-ineffective because of the distance to environmentally and&#13;
socially acceptable disposal sites. Complete treatment at wastewater treatment facilities was ruled&#13;
out because the major existing facility at Ayala is too small and located in a high-income&#13;
commercial and residential area unsuited to regular collection vehicle traffic. Sea disposal, while&#13;
found to be the cheapest alternative, was considered environmentally unacceptable as a permanent&#13;
solution unless the project's implementation experience indicates otherwise.'&#13;
6.17   Given the above factors, and the assumption that the volume of septage will continue to&#13;
increase with the increasing number of septic tanks, a strategy on how best septage treatment can&#13;
be expanded in a sustainable manner is necessary. Under the project, a pilot septage treatment&#13;
plant is proposed to be constructed at the site of the existing Dagat-Dagatan wastewater&#13;
treatment facility. Sludge from Dagat-Dagatan and septage collected in excess of the capacity of&#13;
the pilot plant would be disposed at sea. Sea disposal is scheduled to cease in 2003 by which time&#13;
sufficient treatment capacity is planned to be in place. The combination of phased construction of&#13;
septage treatment capacity, utilization of an existing wastewater treatment plant, and temporary&#13;
sea disposal represents the most practical and least-cost option for the septic tank management&#13;
program if sea disposal is only available as a temporary solution.&#13;
6.18   Rehabilitation of the Ayala and Central sewerage systems represents delayed maintenance&#13;
and is the least-cost solution for that project component in the present circumstances. The Ayala&#13;
sewerage system was built by a private developer in the early 1950s and ownership was&#13;
transferred to MWSS in 1991. The system is in need of extensive repairs. The Central sewerage&#13;
1 Five septage management options: treatment (physical, biological, chemical), sea disposal, lahar site disposal, dewatering, and&#13;
incineration, were reviewed and their costs were estimated. Sea disposal is the least expesive option ($15,000/m3), followed by&#13;
disposal in the lahar lava fields resulting from the Mt. Pinatubo emption (18,000/m3-the practical application of this method is still in&#13;
the research stage) and land-based chemical/biomedhanical treatment ($11 5,000/m3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
system was built in 1904-11 and last rehabilitated over 1981-85. Since then its performance has&#13;
deteriorated due to insufficient maintenance. Rehabilitation after cumulative neglect is not a&#13;
substitute for regular maintenance and repair, and the project loan covenants would ensure that&#13;
MWSS sets aside sufficient funds for adequate maintenance in the future. The sewerage master&#13;
plan currently under preparation will recommend the tariff structure and level and other measures&#13;
required for this purpose.&#13;
Data Base Establishment&#13;
6.19  As mentioned above, the proposed project is a learning-by-doing exercise with the idea of&#13;
generating sufficient information on institutional and technical options for future sewerage and&#13;
sanitation strategy in the entire metropolitan area. Such a data base requires information on the&#13;
number, location, and average size of septic tanks, their adequacy, repair, and accessibility, the&#13;
contents and characteristics of the septage, the efficiency of the treatment plant, and MWSS's&#13;
capacity to manage collection and treatment arrangements. The pilot project provides an effective&#13;
mechanism for gathering information to optimize the technical and institutional design of the&#13;
major investments planned for 1999 and beyond.&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
6.20  There is little risk of adverse impact on the marine environment due to sea disposal of&#13;
septage; both the Government's Environment Management Bureau and an independent external&#13;
consultant engaged by the Bank to evaluate the likely impact of sea dumping concluded that the&#13;
risk was minimal due to the low levels of contaminants in domestic septage and the exceptionally&#13;
high dispersion characteristics of the disposal site, which is more than 40 km from the nearest&#13;
shoreline. Confirmation of the environmental impact of sea-dumping through a mathematical&#13;
dispersion model prepared by an independent consultant would be a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
6.21   There is some risk of short-dumping of the septage by contractors. Adequate supervision&#13;
and monitoring, including the presence of Coast Guard personnel on the vessels and random&#13;
checking, and the presence of considerable traffic in Manila Bay should minimize this risk.&#13;
Significant protection would also be provided by contractual clauses imposing strong sanctions,&#13;
which should serve as a strong disincentive against violations.&#13;
6.22  There is also a risk of delays in building septage treatment plants and possible continuation&#13;
of sea disposal beyond the stipulated period. The advantage of the sea disposal option, which&#13;
entails relatively low capital costs, is that it can be inexpensively terminated once the capital&#13;
investment has been recovered, whether the proposed septage treatment plants are ready or not.&#13;
The proposed project includes financing for the design of future sewerage and sanitation&#13;
investments required to phase out sea disposal of septage by the year 2003. At negotiations,&#13;
MWSS confirmed its commitment to the cessation timetable (see para 3.13).&#13;
6.23  There are no other unusual risks associated with the project.  Some resistance to&#13;
connecting to the sewer system is possible particularly if households are satisfied with existing&#13;
arrangements and want to avoid paying the sewerage charge. However, the planned expansion of&#13;
10,000 connections is small in a metropolitan area the size of MM. Further, it is expected that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
sewerage charge may be extended to all consumers in the future since wastewater from all&#13;
households enters either the separate sewer system or the combined sewer and drainage system.&#13;
This would eliminate the disincentive to connect.&#13;
6.24 The inability of MWSS to manage the increased scale of the septic tank management&#13;
program could also pose a project risk. This risk will be minimized by giving a contract for the&#13;
operation and management of the entire septage collection and disposal arrangement to the&#13;
private sector. This would also increase private sector participation in MWSS operations, which&#13;
is considered desirable by the Government.&#13;
6.25  Continued inadequate maintenance of rehabilitated and newly constructed facilities would&#13;
constitute a risk to the project and undermine its economic justification. This problem would be&#13;
addressed by ensuring that revenue generated from sewerage and environmental charges is&#13;
sufficient and not diverted for other purposes and that the budgetary provision for maintenance&#13;
and repair is adequate. As part of project preparation, SSD has undertaken an asset inventory and&#13;
produced maintenance guidelines which would be used to ensure adequate budgetary allocation&#13;
for preventive and regular maintenance.&#13;
6.26  Another potential risk is the possibility of delayed implementation of rehabilitation of&#13;
separate Central and Ayala sewerage networks by one to two years due to the uncertainties of&#13;
rehabilitation works and difficulties with excavation in MM under heavy traffic conditions. The&#13;
concentration of all rehabilitation works in one contract would attract a larger and more&#13;
experienced contractor, which would mitigate that risk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
Agreements&#13;
7.1   During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government and the MWSS that:&#13;
(a)   MWSS would establish and hold the Special Account in a commercial bank&#13;
specially authorized for this purpose by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas on terms&#13;
and conditions acceptable to the Bank (para 3.22);&#13;
(b)   MWSS would submit a report summarizing the results of monitoring the&#13;
compliance with the EMPs annually starting from December 31, 1996 and a report&#13;
containing an independent audit of the septage management program annually&#13;
starting from June 1997 (para 3.25);&#13;
(c)   MWSS would prepare a separate budget for the overall sewerage activity including&#13;
the income statement and balance sheet for FY97 and thereafter (para 5.1);&#13;
(d)   Commencing during FY97, cash transfer of the difference between the water and&#13;
sewerage inter-fund receivable and payable accounts would be made at the end of&#13;
each quarter, and the account closed at each year end (para 5.7);&#13;
(e)   MWSS financial statements, including separate ones for SSD, as well as Special&#13;
Account and Statements of Expenditure, will be audited by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, and will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the&#13;
close of each fiscal year (para 5.8);&#13;
(f)   MWSS net accounts receivable would not exceed three months of billing&#13;
commencing from FY96 (para 5.11);&#13;
(g)   MWSS shall take all necessary measures including adjustments of the structure or&#13;
levels of sewerage rates and shall produce, for each fiscal year starting in 1996,&#13;
funds from SSD's internal sources equivalent to not less than 25% of annual&#13;
average of SSD capital expenditure (para 5.19);&#13;
(h)   MWSS shall not incur for its sewerage activity any debt unless a reasonable&#13;
forecast of SSD's net revenues for each fiscal year during the term of the debt to&#13;
be incurred shall be at least 1.2 the estimate of the debt service requirements for&#13;
the activity (para 5.20);&#13;
(i)    MWSS would send the Bank (a) no later than March 31 and September 30 of each&#13;
project year, commencing on September 30, 1996, semi-annual project progress&#13;
reports, including revised project cost estimates and implementing schedules, (b)&#13;
no later than March 31 of each project year, commencing on March 31, 1996,&#13;
SSD's annual updated financial projections, and (c) no later than six months after&#13;
completion of the project the evaluation report on project implementation (para&#13;
5.21); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
(j)     MWSS would adhere to the timetable for cessation of sea disposal of septage&#13;
(para 6.22).&#13;
7.2   At negotiations, the Government and the MWSS confirmed (a) project financing plan&#13;
(para 3.10), (b) adherence to the implementation action plan defining the scope and timing of&#13;
actions (para 3.13), (c) format and content of progress and project evaluation reports (3.32), and&#13;
(d) SSD financial plan (para 5.16).&#13;
7.3   At negotiations, the Government confirmed that in the event of changes in the&#13;
responsibility for providing sewerage services in MM from MWSS to another entity during&#13;
implementation of the project, it would consult the Bank prior to undertaking any such changes or&#13;
restructuring (para 4.11).&#13;
7.4   The following would be conditions of loan effectiveness: execution of lease agreement&#13;
between DPWH and MWSS (para 3.14); receipt by MWSS of ECCs for collection, barging and&#13;
sea disposal, Dagat-Dagatan pilot septage treatment plant, and rehabilitation of Central and Ayala&#13;
sewerage systems and Ayala treatment plant (para 3.26); the implementation of water tariff&#13;
increase, including indexed sewerage tariff and environmental charge (para 5.5); and completion&#13;
of mathematical modeling of septage dispersal at the ocean disposal site (para 6.20).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
7.5   Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project constitutes a suitable&#13;
basis for a Bank loan of US$57.0 million equivalent, for a period of 20 years, including a grace&#13;
period of five years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The borrower would be MWSS&#13;
and the Government would provide the loan guarantee.&#13;

PHILIPPINES&#13;
MANILA SECOND SEWERAGE PROJECT&#13;
Services in the project area&#13;
General&#13;
1.    Metro Manila (MM) covers an area of about 636 km2 along the eastern shore of Manila&#13;
Bay. MM is the primary administrative and cultural center, with the highest concentration of&#13;
commerce, industry, manufacturing, banking and education services. It comprises eight cities and&#13;
nine municipalities' with total 1995 population of 8.9 million. The built-up area occupies about&#13;
300 km2 or 47% of the total area. About 2.5 million or near 30% of the total, mainly migrants&#13;
from rural areas, live in about 600 slums. The combined effects of population pressures and&#13;
ineffective control of industrial growths, have contributed to the overloading of the existing&#13;
infrastructure and to a rapid deterioration of the environment.&#13;
2.    The sewerage and street drainage services are provided by the Metropolitan Waterworks&#13;
and Sewerage System (MWSS), a government corporation established in 1971, and by each&#13;
municipality, respectively.  Canals, rivers and main drainage works controlling floods are&#13;
maintained by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The responsibility for&#13;
planning and coordination of several metro-wide services, namely transport and traffic&#13;
management, solid waste management, pollution control, flood control, drainage, sewerage, land&#13;
use planning and zoning was recently vested in the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority&#13;
(MvMDA) established in March 1995. Its policy-making and governing body is a council&#13;
composed of all MM mayors, the chairman of the council has the rank of a cabinet member and is&#13;
appointed by the president.&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
3.    Water in MM and neighboring Rizal and part of Cavite provinces is supplied by MWSS&#13;
and about 2,200 private wells. In 1994 the MWSS daily average production was 2.8 million m3,&#13;
of which 1.15 million m3 was sold (0.67 million m3 to residential users, 0.3 million m3 to&#13;
commercial users, 0.12 million m3 to government users and 0.06 million m3 to industries) and&#13;
1.65 million m3 was non-revenue water. Water was sold through 815,000 connections of which&#13;
93% were residential. The water supply system capacity is about 2.90 million m3/d. MWSS is&#13;
expanding its production and distribution capacity to 3.1 million m3/d in 1996 and 4.0 million m3/d&#13;
by 1999.&#13;
4.    Only specific areas of MM, plus some parts of Bacoor and Kawit in Cavite are served by&#13;
MWSS's central distribution system; peripheral areas in the north, east and south and the other&#13;
parts of Cavite and Rizal rely predominantly on isolated MWSS or private groundwater systems.&#13;
Water use through private wells in 1994 was estimated at 0.94 million m3/d, of which 0.46 million&#13;
The cities of Manila, Makati, Mandaluyong, Muntinlumpa, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon and Calookan and municipalities of Las&#13;
Pinas, Malabon, Marikina, Navotas, Paranaque, Pateros, San Juan, Taguig and Valenzuela.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33                             ANNEX I&#13;
m3/d was residential, 0.40 million m3/d industrial and 0.07 million m3/d commercial use. Of the&#13;
total, 0.64 million m3/d was used in MM and the rest in Rizal and Cavite.&#13;
Sewerage Services&#13;
5.    The physical infrastructure for the provision of sewerage and sanitation services in the&#13;
service area are separate sanitary sewerage systems, public (communal) sanitation facilities, and&#13;
private septic tanks. There are five sanitary sewerage systems in operation in the area: (i) the&#13;
Central Sewerage System, (ii) the Ayala System, (iii) the Dagat-Dagatan System, (iv) the Quezon&#13;
City System, and (v) the National Housing Authority Systems.&#13;
Central Sewerage System&#13;
6.    The Central Sewerage System (CSS) is designed Jo operate as a separate sanitary&#13;
sewerage system to serve an area of 26.17 km2 or 70% of Manila city. In 1994, the number of&#13;
household connections to the system was 85,000 and it was estimated that the system serves&#13;
about 930,000 people (based on the planning figure of 11 persons per water connection). In&#13;
1991, about 21,000 households (pop. 230,000) within the system were not connected. The CSS&#13;
was originally constructed during 1904-11. It consists of two collection networks, north and&#13;
south of the Pasig River, of about 187 km of sewer mains, initially covering an area of about 18.3&#13;
km2. Its trunk and main sewers are mostly made of cast-in-place concrete, while the majority of&#13;
smaller lines (525 mm and below) are made of vitrified clay. It has a double barrel siphon under&#13;
Pasig River made of 2 x 600 mm diameter CI pipes encased in concrete.&#13;
7.    The northern system includes the Legarda and Sta. Cruz lift stations and the southern&#13;
includes the Paco, Malate, Luneta and Port Area lift stations. Both systems terminate at the&#13;
Tondo station which pumps the wastewater through a 1050 mm outfall 3.8 km into Manila Bay.&#13;
The Sta. Ana sewerage system, constructed in 1935-37, includes the collection system and a lift&#13;
station, initially discharging into a communal septic tank with an effluent pipe to the Pasig River.&#13;
This system was connected to the CSS within the phase I expansion program (1981-85), under&#13;
which the communal septic tank was abandoned, and the lift station discharge pipe connected&#13;
directly to the Paco trunk line.&#13;
8.    The expansions carried out within the phase I increased the original service area by 7.87&#13;
km2. Apart from the connection of the Sta. Ana system to CSS, the following major expansions&#13;
to the central service area have been made: a) Pandacan Catchment (3.61 km2) was provided with&#13;
a separate sewerage system consisting of 31 km of sewer mains ranging from 200-900 mm&#13;
diameter; b) Dagupan Catchment separate system (2.76 kM2) consists of 59 km of sewer mains&#13;
and laterals of 200-1200 mm diameter; c) Tondo Foreshore Catchment separate sewerage system&#13;
was developed by the National Housing Authority (NHA) during 1976-79 and was taken over by&#13;
MWSS and connected to the central sewerage system in 1985. It covers an area of 1.5 km2.&#13;
9.    The phase I rehabilitation works not only replaced the dilapidated facilities but also&#13;
increased their capacity to cope with the greater wastewater flows.  The Tondo station&#13;
rehabilitated under phase I includes a bar-screen house, pump station building, four dry-pit type&#13;
non-clog centrifugal pumps with two variable-speed and two constant-speed drives, and electrical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                               ANNEX 1&#13;
and control equipment for automatic operation. The capacity of the station is 5.0 m3/s. The new&#13;
Bay outfall includes 3.9 km of 1800 mm diameter pipe of which 1.2 km are on-shore and 2.7 km&#13;
offshore. Screened raw wastewater is discharged through this outfall into the Bay via a 350 m&#13;
diffuser section at a depth of 11 m.&#13;
10.   A major objective of the phase I project was the rehabilitation of the collection system and&#13;
of the seven lift stations. The original contract for sewer rehabilitation included a comprehensive&#13;
TV-inspection, as well as cleaning and rehabilitation of the entire central collection system. It&#13;
further included: (a) raising of manholes and replacement of all unserviceable and substandard CI&#13;
frames and covers; (b) grouting of leaking pipe joints and repair of damaged pipes and (c)&#13;
construction of overflows with flap valves and closing or plugging inflow sources such as&#13;
drainage bypasses without flap valves.&#13;
11.   However, the project was substantially reduced due to shortage of funds. It was divided&#13;
into smaller construction contracts with one providing equipment for MWSS's cleaning and&#13;
rehabilitation unit. Further, the additional manholes were reduced to 93. The construction of&#13;
overflows with flap valves was limited to six and design was greatly simplified to further reduce&#13;
cost. TV-inspection was reduced to selected pipes below 450 mm diameter. The TV inspection&#13;
revealed many badly cracked sewer pipes, leaking pipe joints, misaligned pipe sections, and&#13;
sagged lines with considerable siltation. Examination of the Pasig River twin-pipe inverted siphon&#13;
revealed an obstruction in the eastmost pipe. The reduced capacity of the siphon causes backing&#13;
of sewage to the Luneta lift station. The obstruction could not be removed during the program.&#13;
Similarly, a majority of various defects was not repaired due to lack of funds. The rehabilitation&#13;
program of the seven lift stations included converting the existing dry pits to wet pits, repairing&#13;
sub- and super- structures, constructing external by-pass structures, installing new non-clog&#13;
submersible sewage pumps and electrical equipment. There are three to five identical pumps in&#13;
each station with one unit providing stand-by capacity. The proposed external by-pass structures&#13;
were not implemented during the rehabilitation program due to limited outside space at the Paco&#13;
and Legarda lift stations.&#13;
12.   Despite the rehabilitation carried out within the phase I, the collection and lift functions of&#13;
CSS are in poor condition. While the system is designed to be operated by gravity with several&#13;
intermediate lift stations, most of the time, it is operated under surcharged conditions due to: (a)&#13;
heavy surface water inflows from esteros and drainage canals during times of high tide; (b)&#13;
reduced capacity of the Tondo station since the two variable speed pump-sets have worn&#13;
impellers and are out-of-operation and (c) clogged and broken sewer pipes which allow the lift&#13;
stations to operate for only a few hours daily.&#13;
13.   Other defects and deficiencies are: (a) thirty overflows to drainage lines or esteros are&#13;
without flap valves; (b) twenty-eight major defects on sewer lines are on record but never&#13;
repaired; (c) about 21,000 house connections are still to be installed in the expanded central&#13;
service area. Homeowners are reluctant to connect for two reasons (i) reluctance to pay for the&#13;
internal house and plot pipe relocation and (ii) despite the fact that service connections are made&#13;
free of charge, the beneficiaries of the Tondo Foreshore and Leveriza NHA projects refuse to&#13;
connect due to deficient sewer lines (silted and obstructed lines, overflowing manholes); (d) SSD&#13;

maintenance equipment is dilapidated or not operational; and (e) vital spare parts for&#13;
mechanicalUelectrical equipment (a pre-requisite for smooth operation) are not in stock.&#13;
Ayala System&#13;
14.   The Ayala Sewerage System covers an area of 6.0 km2, of which 3.7 km2 are high-income&#13;
residential areas, 1.8 km2 are used by commerce (Makati Commercial Center and the high rise&#13;
office blocks in Salcedo and Legaspi Villages), and 0.2 km2 are occupied by institutions (hospital,&#13;
colleges and churches). The rest is open space (parks). The system has 3,009 house connections.&#13;
The population equivalent of the commercial/institutional service is estimated at 85,000.&#13;
15.  It is located in a part of Makati known as the Ayala sub-division, and development was&#13;
started in the early 1950 by the Makati Development Corporation, now called Ayala Land&#13;
Corporation (ALC). During 1958-64, the ALC constructed a separate sanitary sewerage system&#13;
along with a trickling filter wastewater treatment plant (WTP); all subdivisions developed&#13;
thereafter were provided with a sanitary sewerage network connected to the treatment plant.&#13;
During 1977-79, the trickling filters were abandoned and replaced by an activated sludge plant,&#13;
and expanded to its present capacity of 40,000 m3/d. The Ayala Sewerage System was operated&#13;
by the ALC until July 1991 when the ownership was transferred to MWSS.&#13;
16.   The sewerage network is operated by gravity with the flow being collected at the WTP&#13;
situated in the low lying south-western tip of the service area adjacent to the high-income&#13;
residential neighborhood. The sewerage system has 69 km of sewer pipes from 200 mm-1050&#13;
mm, all made of reinforced concrete. The WTP has a designed capacity to provide primary and&#13;
secondary treatment for an average flow of 40,000 m3 per day. Secondary treatment uses an&#13;
activated sludge process. The final effluent from the plant is discharged into the Maricaban&#13;
Creek. Sludge from both the primary and secondary treatment is conveyed in primary and&#13;
secondary anaerobic digesters for stabilization. Digested sludge is dried in beds and collected by&#13;
farmers and used as soil conditioner/fertilizer.&#13;
17.   The plant is overloaded and periodically overflows to surface streams. There are two&#13;
main reasons for the surcharged conditions: first, the network capacity is reduced due to pipe&#13;
defects and clogging, the most critical being the trunk line along EDSA highway which is the main&#13;
artery of the scheme. Second, unauthorized surface water connections have been made, resulting&#13;
in large volumes of surface water entering the separate sewer network. Eliminating these defects&#13;
would reduce wastewater flows to below the present capacity of the two trunk sewers entering&#13;
the WTP. The plant is presently under-performing for the following reasons: (a) the plant is in&#13;
poor state of repair; (b) some of the mechanical equipment has been removed from service; (c)&#13;
most, if not all, of the existing mechanical and electrical components are worn out, making a&#13;
reliable and continuous operation impossible; (d) spare parts for the old equipment cannot be&#13;
obtained; (e) all the measuring and control equipment is either removed from service or&#13;
inoperable; (f) several concrete structural components' systems and many of the electrical conduit&#13;
systems are severely corroded; (g) blowers serving the secondary aeration processes are operated&#13;
only a few hours during daytime, when nearby residents are least likely to complain about odors.&#13;
To avoid complaints about noise, blowers are not operated during night hours. In order to keep a&#13;

certain level of aeration, floating aerators are operated and (h) the digester gas piping system and&#13;
gas flare have been removed; gas generated in digesters is discharged directly to the atmosphere.&#13;
Dagat-Dagatan System&#13;
18.   Dagat-Dagatan is one of the major sites and services housing projects developed by the&#13;
NHA during 1979-86. It covers parts of the municipalities of Navotas, Malabon, and the cities of&#13;
Caloocan and Manila. It has an area of 3.32 kM2, which was reclaimed by an average landfill of&#13;
2.5 meters. The sewerage system comprises about 18 km of sanitary sewers, a pumping station&#13;
and wastewater treatment in oxidation ponds. The ponds cover an area of approximately 5 ha. Of&#13;
the three modules initially planned, each having an aerated, facultative and polishing pond, only&#13;
two have been constructed. The site of the third module has been occupied by squatters. In 1991&#13;
MWSS took over the facilities.&#13;
Quezon City System&#13;
19.   Quezon City has 41 minor sub-divisional sewerage systems covering a total service area of&#13;
about 13 km2. The total sewer length is about 114 km ranging in diameter from 200 mm to 600&#13;
mm. Of the 41 systems, 39 have a communal septic tank and two are provided with Imhoff tanks.&#13;
As of 1994, 23,300 households were connected. Some of the communal septic tanks have&#13;
become inaccessible due to obstructions by illegal buildings. Desludging of the treatment facilities&#13;
is not done regularly.&#13;
National Housing Authority Systems&#13;
20.   The National Housing Authority has nine sub-divisional sanitary sewerage systems built as&#13;
part of their housing projects which they are expecting to turn over to MWSS. One of these, the&#13;
Karangalan sewerage system in Cainta (Rizal), has just been turned over to MWSS. The others&#13;
are: Martin de Porres sewerage system in Cubao, Quezon City, Tangos sewerage system in&#13;
Tangos, Navotas, Capri sewerage system in Novaliches, Quezon City, Maricaban sewerage&#13;
system in Pasay City, Maharlika Village sewerage system in Taguig, Leverita sewerage system in&#13;
Malate, Manila City, Juan Luna sewerage system in Tondo, Manila City, Bangong-Nayon&#13;
sewerage system in Antipolo, Rizal.&#13;
Public Sanitation Facilities&#13;
21.   There are 25 community-managed public sanitation facilities (PSF) in MM. The facilities&#13;
in each unit incrude: public faucets, toilets, bathrooms and laundry areas. Wastes from these&#13;
facilities are collected and treated in septic tanks.&#13;
Private Septic Tanks&#13;
22.   Most of the population in MM rely on private individual septic tanks for their sanitation&#13;
services. While it is estimated that there is about one million the actual number is not known.&#13;
One of the goals of the proposed Manila Second Sewerage Project is to acquire information on&#13;
the number of such private individual septic tanks during the first phase (1996-98) of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37                             ANNEX 1&#13;
In later projects, several septage treatment plants (with an aggregate capacity of 3,000 m3/d)&#13;
would be constructed.&#13;
23.   As a rule, the septic tanks have no soil absorption systems, nor are they regularly&#13;
desludged. Consequently, the effluent is discharged, along with the sludge (septage), into the&#13;
inland waterways, typically through the existing storm drains. Unserviced septic tanks are&#13;
estimated to contribute at least 150 tons of BOD per day into the inland waterways.&#13;
24.   Desludging services are provided under a special program known as STAMP, an acronym&#13;
for Septic Tank Maintenance Program. It was developed under METROSS I which provided&#13;
financing for collecting vehicles.  There are two parallel septic tank emptying services in&#13;
operation: scheduled and unscheduled.  Scheduled services, provided by private contractors&#13;
retained by MWSS, were initially expected to achieve desludging of about 120,000 tanks annually&#13;
or each septic tank once in a five-year period. Each contractor serving a specific service area was&#13;
also responsible for transporting the septage and securing suitable sites for its disposing. Because&#13;
most contractors had difficulty in securing sites acceptable to the Environmental Management&#13;
Bureau, only two operate at present. Both discharge the collected septage at a stone quarry&#13;
leased from a private owner about 65 km north of MM. The MWSS monitors the contractor's&#13;
operations both at the pick-up point and at the disposal site. Arrangements are under way to&#13;
engage four additional septage collection contractors.&#13;
25.   Unscheduled services, designed to meet customer emergencies as well as desludging&#13;
communal septic tanks, are provided by staff of the Septic Tank Maintenance Division of SSD.&#13;
The collected septage is discharged into the Luneta lift station from where it is pumped along with&#13;
other wastewater to the Tondo Pumping Station for final disposal through the marine outfall. The&#13;
MWSS uses six 11.7 cubic meter tanker trucks and three portable gasoline-driven diaphragm&#13;
pumps.&#13;
26.   Households are charged separately for the unscheduled service; the scheduled services are&#13;
covered by a 10% environmental charge levied on all MWSS water bills. From 1981 to June&#13;
1992, 17,144 septic tanks, or on an average 1,550 tanks annually, were desludged under the&#13;
scheduled maintenance program. In 1991, however, only 1,160 septic tanks were serviced, far&#13;
below 120,000 annually to meet the MWSS target of five-year cycle of desludging. From 1981 to&#13;
June 1992, 5,183 septic tanks were desludged under the unscheduled program, with 212 being&#13;
serviced from January to June of this year.&#13;
27.   The key constraints to acceptable servicing of septic and Imhoff tanks in MM are: (a)&#13;
difficulty in identifying sites to meet the Environmental Management Bureau's requirements for&#13;
the disposal of the great volume of septage; (b) lack of access to many septic tanks, and (c)&#13;
necessity and difficulty in liquefying septage, which involves diluting it with water adding volume&#13;
to the septage. To address the constraints, it has been proposed that: (a) MWSS should provide&#13;
adequate treatment facility to facilitate final disposal of septage; (b) regulations and enforcement&#13;
(for septic tank location) be more rigorous for those obtaining building permits and (c) the use of&#13;
concrete mix vibrators, rather than adding water for liquefying sludge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                             ANNEX 1&#13;
Drainage&#13;
28.   Drainage is one of the most important infrastructure systems in MM since a considerable&#13;
part of the area is flat and its river system is charged with high flows originating in higher reaches&#13;
during the five-month rainy season. The drainage system in MM covers most of the built-up area;&#13;
however, Rizal and Cavite provinces have only very limited facilities. The drainage system has&#13;
two components: (a) the flood control and main drainage system, and (b) the local street drainage&#13;
system.&#13;
29.   The flood control and main drainage system represents the primary collection for flood&#13;
control. It includes a network of 450 km of rivers and open canals 2.0 m to 60 m wide, about 41&#13;
km of box culverts and closed conduits of large diameters, 835 km of collecting drains of various&#13;
diameters and 12 flood control pumping stations (capacity 172 m3/s in total), flood gates and&#13;
retention ponds. The main drainage facilities are provided, operated and maintained by the Flood&#13;
Control and Drainage Division of DPWH.&#13;
30.   The local street drainage system consists of several thousand kilometers of open and&#13;
covered drains and pipes with diameters less than 750 mm. It represents the secondary and&#13;
tertiary collection network, which empties itself into the primary or main storm drainage system.&#13;
The Local Government Code of 1991 assigns the responsibility for the street drainage system (and&#13;
public sanitation) to MM cities and municipalities; these responsibilities are usually carried out&#13;
within the city engineers department in connection with road construction and maintenance.&#13;
While the main drainage system is reasonably well maintained, the street drains are generally&#13;
poorly constructed and inadequately maintained. The technical documentation on the type, size,&#13;
length, location, etc. of street drains is available in the city engineers departments but is usually&#13;
incomplete.&#13;
31.   By default, though not by design, the drainage system serves as a combined storm and&#13;
sanitary sewer system. This is because, in addition to functioning as conduits for storm water&#13;
drainage, they also carry sanitary wastewater effluent from septic tanks which are generally&#13;
designed without any soil absorption systems. This is deemed to be one of the major sources of&#13;
pollution of the inland waterways in MM.&#13;
Solid Waste Management&#13;
32.   The responsibility for solid waste management and disposal in Metro Manila, rests with&#13;
the newly established Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA). This includes the&#13;
formulation and implementation of policies, standards, programs, and projects for proper and&#13;
sanitary collection and disposal. It also includes the implementation of alternative programs to&#13;
reduce, reuse and recycle solid wastes.&#13;
33.   The amount of solid waste generated in MM was estimated in 1995 to be about 5,500 tons&#13;
per day. Of the quantity generated, about 75%-80% is collected. Some of the rest is partly&#13;
buried or burned at source, but the majority is deposited into drainage systems, esteros and rivers,&#13;
thereby making a significant contribution to the pollution of inland waterways. In 1995 there&#13;
were two open dumping stations, one transfer station, and two sanitary landfill sites. The two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39                              ANNEX 1&#13;
sanitary landfill sites are the San Mateo landfill located in the north, and the Carmona landfill in&#13;
the south. They are being operated provisionally, pending detailed designs and an environmental&#13;
impact assessment. It is envisioned that the landfills, planned to be completed in 1998, would&#13;
accept dewatered sludge from future septage or wastewater treatment plants.&#13;

MANILA SECOND SEWERAGE PROJECT&#13;
Project description&#13;
General&#13;
1.    The improvement of wastewater services in Metro Manila (MM), outlined in the 1979&#13;
sewerage master plan, envisaged a phased expansion of the conventional separate sewerage&#13;
system. Only a part of its first phase, however, was implemented and foliowing phases had to be&#13;
discontinued on account of prohibitive costs. Subsequent reviews have indicated that adoption of&#13;
a combined sewerage system which would utilize the existing drainage network and the large&#13;
number of household septic tanks would allow a gradual, and less expensive alternative for&#13;
wastewater services and reduction of pollution. Based on these findings, MWSS' consultants&#13;
under JICA financing are now preparing a new (1996) sewerage master plan which will propose&#13;
phased upgrading of existing facilities into a combined sewerage system.&#13;
2.    Properly operated septic tanks could remove from wastewater at least 30%  of the&#13;
pollution expressed in BOD, a key condition for which is periodic removal of the sludge from the&#13;
tanks; an adequate desludging program, however, has never been implemented in MM due to&#13;
unavailability of any treatment facility or sites suitable for disposal of septage.&#13;
3.    A septage management plan developed within the project addresses that deficiency. The&#13;
plan aims at desludging during 1996-2010 each of the one million septic tanks estimated to exist&#13;
in MM. Since current data necessary for locating and constructing a large-scale septage treatment&#13;
plant are not available the plan proposes to acquire in the first phase (1996-1999) the necessary&#13;
data through (a) providing a pilot septage treatment plant with the capacity of 200 m3/day and (b)&#13;
desludging about 300,000 tanks. In the second phase (1999-2005) and the third phase (2006-&#13;
2010), which would both essentially coincide with the phased upgrading of the sewerage system,&#13;
the master plan proposes the construction of several septage treatment plants with an aggregated&#13;
capacity of over 3,000 m3/d, and desludging about one million tanks. The plants will be designed&#13;
on the basis of one year operation of the pilot plant and evaluation of data on characteristic and&#13;
spatial distribution of septage acquired during desludging of the 300,000 tanks. The septage&#13;
collected during the data acquisition and the treatment plants construction will be disposed of at&#13;
an allocated dumping site in the sea. The dumping of septage will start in early 1996 with a&#13;
quantity of about 1,000 m3/d, which will increase to 1,500 m3/d during 1999-2001 and decrease&#13;
to 600 m3/d in 2003. The sea dumping will be terminated at the end of 2003.&#13;
Project components&#13;
4.    The project will: (a) construct three barge loading stations for temporary disposal of&#13;
septage at sea under a private collection and disposal contract, (b) construct a pilot septage&#13;
treatment plant, (c) rehabilitate the central and Ayala sewerage systems, Ayala treatment plant,&#13;
and construct about 10,000 sewer house connections in the MWSS service area and (d) provide&#13;
maintenance equipment, tools, spare parts and laboratory instruments. The technical assistance&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41                               ANNEX 2&#13;
will (i) help implement the project including support for environmental monitoring and&#13;
management, (ii) prepare designs and documents for the follow-up expansion of the sewerage&#13;
system and the septage treatment plants, and (iii) prepare documents for implementation of the&#13;
next water supply project.&#13;
5.    The proposed project is intended to help the Government improve the quality of sanitation&#13;
services and to enable MWSS to radically expand its septage management program in order to:&#13;
(a) quickly reduce the pollution of Metro Manila waterways and Manila Bay, (b) reduce the health&#13;
hazards associated with human exposure to sewage, and (c) establish the conditions needed for&#13;
gradual low-cost improvement of sewerage services in Metro Manila.&#13;
Septage management&#13;
6.    The septage management represents pilot operation which covers three aspects namely: (i)&#13;
collection and hauling of septage from septic tanks, (ii) sea dumping of septage, and (iii) pilot&#13;
septage treatment plant. Based on the estimated distribution of septic tanks, the Metro Manila&#13;
area is subdivided into collection areas, first two and the third later, served by three barge loading&#13;
stations (Napindan, Estero de Vitas first and Paranaque) and by the Dagat Dagatan pilot septage&#13;
treatment plant. The collection, hauling and sea dumping of septage will also include extensive&#13;
data gathering on the quality and quantity of septage, types and state of repair of tanks. These&#13;
activities will be aggregated into one contract for each barging location and treatment plant and&#13;
carried out by contractors employed by MWSS. The specification for collection will require that&#13;
priority be given to the Pasig River area and that at least 80% of septage be pumped by vacuum&#13;
pumps provided with deodorizing chamber for vacuum exhaust in order to protect the&#13;
environment during the collection.&#13;
7.    The barge loading stations are: Napindan, located at the confluence of the Napindan and&#13;
the Pasig rivers, Estero de Vitas, located at the Manila Bay shore adjacent to the mouth of the&#13;
Estero de Vitas in Navotas, and Paranaque, to be located on land to be reclaimed along the&#13;
Paranaque Channel. The on-going reclamation is to be completed in 1997 and includes deepening&#13;
of the Channel to six meter depth. The stations will operate as typical load transfer stations and&#13;
will consist of: pipes to convey the septage from the septage tanker to the barge, water flushing&#13;
facility to clean the tanker with the river or Bay water, small office to monitor the station&#13;
operations, parking place for septage tankers, and barge berthing with appropriate moorings.&#13;
8.    The dumping area for septage designated by the Philippine Coast Guard is located 68 km&#13;
off Corregidor Island at the inlet to Manila Bay from Luzon Sea. In the initial three years only the&#13;
barge loading stations at Napindan and Estero de Vitas will be operational. The third station at&#13;
Paranaque will be constructed in 1999 after the ongoing land reclamation in the area is completed.&#13;
The dumping cycle is approximately 44 hours consisting of loading (12 hours), navigation (12&#13;
hours one way) and spread dumping (8 hours). The vessel could be either a tanker-type barge&#13;
towed by a tugboat or a tanker ship. In either case the vessel draft must be low to conform to the&#13;
shallow conditions in the barge loading stations. The sea dumpsite environment will be monitored&#13;
jointly by the barging contractor, MWSS and the Coast Guard with results to be submitted to the&#13;
Environmental Management Bureau.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

9.    The treatment will be provided at the existing plant at Dagat-Dagatan where septage will&#13;
be delivered by collection vehicles. The treatment will be provided by one module of 200 m3/d&#13;
capacity. Septage will pass through grit removal and screening to a coagulation tank and, from a&#13;
holding tank, pass through a 15 m3/hr centrifuge. The filtrate from the centrifuge will be pumped&#13;
through a dilution tank to the existing lagoons for treatment. Sludge from the centrifuge will be&#13;
re-dosed with polymer and passed through a secondary centrifuge. Thereafter, de-watered&#13;
sludge, grit and screening will be disposed of at San Mateo sanitary landfill.&#13;
Rehabilitation of central sewerage system&#13;
10.   The works to be carried out under the project will include: (a) pipeline and manhole&#13;
renovation; (b) installation of flap valves; (c) pumping station and lift station improvements; (d)&#13;
provision of standby equipment; (e) cleaning the Pasig River siphon and Tondo outfall diffuser&#13;
outlets; (f) construction of about 10,000 new house connections to sewers.&#13;
11.   These components are aimed at restoring the system to its designed capacity with gravity&#13;
flow conditions being maintained between pumping stations. To attain this, backflow from&#13;
esteros and inland rivers into the sewerage system must be eliminated and pumping stations will&#13;
be upgraded to ensure continuous operation. The Pasig river crossing will complement the&#13;
existing twin-pipe syphon under the river. At present one of the pipes is blocked and will be&#13;
cleared under the project.&#13;
12.   The activities included are as follows: (a) pipeline renovation: repair of 28 identified&#13;
major, and 100 minor defects, construction of (i) 30 overflow structures with flap valves to&#13;
prevent backflow, (ii) 30 new manholes and procurement of 2000 manhole frames and covers and&#13;
(iii) new by-pass structures at Paco and Legarda pumping stations, (b) upgrading of pumping&#13;
stations: installation of new screens of stainless steel and grit traps at Tondo pumping station and&#13;
seven lift stations, provision of spare parts for pumping stations; provision of standby pumps and&#13;
generator at each pumping station; removal of blockages from the siphon and diffusers at the end&#13;
of the Tondo outfall sewer; and new sewer connections as required.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Ayala sewerage and treatment&#13;
13.   The project will: (a) replace a defective sewer in EDSA with 486 m of 1050 mm pipe; (b)&#13;
repair about 30 sewer defects; (c) construct 20 new manholes; procure 200 manhole frames and&#13;
covers; construct 30 m of 2 x 600 mm syphons on Amorsolo Street, and (d) construct three new&#13;
overflow sewer lines 30 m long and 900 mm diameter with manholes and flap valves, along&#13;
Amorsolo Street.&#13;
14.   Since the on-going Master Plan studies will propose changes affecting the role of the plant&#13;
within the overall system in Metro Manila, the project proposals have been limited to&#13;
reinstatement of the mechanical pretreatment, i.e. of inlet works and primary sedimentation tanks.&#13;
The inlet pumps will be replaced and the grit tank's mechanical equipment comprising a grit&#13;
collector, grit pump, rotary blowers and an air diffuser will be replaced.  The primary&#13;
sedimentation tanks require new inlet baffles, sludge scrapers and effluent weirs for each of the&#13;
four tanks.&#13;
&#13;

MANILA SECOND SEWERAGE PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The proposed Manila Second Sewerage Project is expected to have a beneficial effect on Metro&#13;
Manila's environment by significantly reducing water-borne pollution, which would have positive&#13;
public health benefits for its 8.9 million residents. By rehabilitating the Central and Ayala sewer&#13;
systems, providing 10,000 additional individual sewer connections, and evacuating some 300,000&#13;
septic tanks, it is expected to reduce BOD pollution of Manila's waterways by some 30%.&#13;
Disposing of treated septage from those tanks through deep-sea dumping - a temporary measure&#13;
until adequate land based treatment and disposal facilities come on-line - is not expected to have&#13;
an adverse effect on the marine or coastal environments.&#13;
All project components have been reviewed by the Philippine Department of Environment and&#13;
Natural Resources (DENR) under the Environmental Impact Statement Law, and discussed with&#13;
community organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). DENR ruled that a full&#13;
Economic Impact Assessment (EIA) was required for the construction of the Dagat-Dagatan&#13;
septage treatment plant (STP) while Project Descriptions (PDs) that briefly describe potential&#13;
environmental impact were adequate for septage collection, construction of barge loading&#13;
stations, sea disposal, and rehabilitation of the Central and Ayala systems. MWSS carried out&#13;
impact assessment studies with assistance from consultants in 1994 and submitted them to DENR&#13;
in May 1995. DENR issuance of Environmental Clearance Certificates (ECCs) will be a condition&#13;
of loan effectiveness. A separate EIA report complying with Bank format was submitted to the&#13;
Bank, and a summary was circulated for Board review in June 1995. The report and the summary&#13;
are available in the project file.&#13;
During appraisal, the EIA reports and other related documents were reviewed and an overall&#13;
environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared. The EMP will be implemented by MWSS,&#13;
assisted by contractors and project supervision consultants. The plan will be integrated into&#13;
bidding and contract documents, and the contractors responsible for project activities will be&#13;
responsible for environmental monitoring. MWSS will be responsible for monitoring and&#13;
reporting compliance. A revised EIA report, including the EMP, taking into account&#13;
Bank/ASTEN comments was submitted to the Bank in January 1996 and was found satisfactory.&#13;
These reports are available in the project file.&#13;
The Dagat -Dagatan Septage Treatment Plant&#13;
The Dagat-Dagatan STP component was subjected to a full environmental assessment, including&#13;
consultation with local residents. The proposed STP (2 ha) will be built on a vacant area of&#13;
MWSS's 15 ha wastewater treatment plant site. The plant is located along a stagnant creek, and&#13;
is surrounded by a concrete wall to prevent encroachment by squatters. The low-lying area is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53                              ANNEX 7&#13;
subject to frequent flooding and is about 1 km from the Smokey Mountain open dump site. The&#13;
area is a low-income community with a high density of squatters and poor environmental quality.&#13;
Eighty-two percent of residents surveyed in the perception study reacted positively to the project&#13;
and viewed it as a possible source of employment. Some raised issues of inadequate piped water&#13;
supply in the area, decreases in land values, increases in odor and noise, and traffic congestion due&#13;
to septage collection tankers. Measurements suggested that apart from dust, air quality in the&#13;
area is within the standards for commercial/industrial areas. Noise levels (61-75 dBA) are within&#13;
the 75 dBA maximum, and traffic appears to be the main source of noise. Noise levels at the&#13;
plant site are about 61 dBA, but those at roadside are 72-75 dBA. Traffic on most of the main&#13;
roads is heavy.&#13;
The EIA showed that the STP, if properly operated, would raise pollution levels only marginally,&#13;
as the daily effluent level would be increased by less than p.25% (from 8,300 m3/d to 8,500&#13;
m3/d). Most of the impact during construction (noise, vibration, and traffic) would be temporary&#13;
and localized and the EMP includes measures to minimize these effects.&#13;
Existing lagoons treat about 8,300 m3/d of wastewater and the effluent-6 mg/l BOD, 33 mg/l&#13;
suspended solids (SS)-is discharged into Maypajo creek. Measurements showed a high level of&#13;
water pollution in the canal, especially BOD, SS, COD, oil/grease, and coliform bacteria. The&#13;
BOD level upstream of the discharge point is 42 mg/l while that at downstream is 29 mg/l.&#13;
To comply with the effluent standards, the STP was designed to remove about 87% BOD and&#13;
98% SS from the incoming septage (5,500 mg/l BOD, 15,000 mg/l SS) and the supernatant (733&#13;
mgfl BOD, 244 mg/l SS) will be further treated in the existing treatment lagoon which will be&#13;
upgraded by aeration. The final effluent (40 mg/l BOD and 35 mg/l SS) will be discharged (8,500&#13;
m3/d) into Maypajo River; this is equivalent to about 340 kg/d BOD and 300 kg/d SS. The main&#13;
potential environmental problems and EMP mitigation measures are summarized in Table A 7-1.&#13;

Table A 7-1: Environmental Problems and Mitigation Measures for Dagat Dagatan STP&#13;
Potential Problems                          Proposed mitigation&#13;
During construction:&#13;
a) higher levels of dust, noise, soil erosion, a) erect temporary sound-barrier around work&#13;
flooding, waste, and traffic: noise level from  sites and avoid simultaneous use of heavy&#13;
equipment would be 70-79 dBA at 10 m, 50- equipment; limit daytime work, 20 km/hr&#13;
69 dBA at 30 m from the source; with proper speed;  provide  regular  watering,  good&#13;
sound-barrier, noise at the property line (10  maintenance of equipment, and temporary&#13;
m) would be about 60 dBA and vibration  drainage and storage facilities for filling and&#13;
would be 55-69 dBA; at 20 km/hr traffic noise  excavation soil; improve access roads to work&#13;
would increase by 8.5 and 5.5 dBA at 0 and 5  sites; complete drainage works immediately&#13;

During operation:&#13;
b) Odors (organic and sulfur compounds) b) treat odor in a carbon absorption tower-,&#13;
mainly from the trucks inside loading zone and  collect and treat all air inside the plant; carry&#13;
septage treatment units; noise from equipment out all operations in the well ventilated&#13;
would be 65-85 dBA; with proper housing  building; install double wall for plant facilities;&#13;
and insulation about 15 dBA can be reduced; cover the units generating noise and odor;&#13;
possible flooding; traffic load would be 60  plant shrubs and trees in the area; design&#13;
collection vehicles per hour.            drainage for a 20 year storm frequency; design&#13;
plant layout for effective flow of traffic.&#13;

mostly confined within the plant boundary (15  maintenance of equipment and machinery;&#13;
ha); spill of septage; accumulation of septage  establish emergency plan; avoid parking of&#13;
when STP is not in operation.            collection trucks along the roads and public&#13;
areas; suspend desludging when STP is not in&#13;
operation.&#13;
d) malfunction of STP operation can increase  d) monitor effluent and receiving waters,&#13;
the level of water pollution in the receiving  noise, and  odor; treat all wastewater&#13;
stream, noise, and odor.                 generated within the plant.&#13;
Under the EMP, the measures proposed in Table A 7-1 b) were included in the detailed design of&#13;
the STP while those proposed in a) and c) will be included in bidding and contract documents.&#13;
MWSS staff will be responsible for operating and monitoring the STP. A plant operation manual,&#13;
including details for housekeeping and prevention of accidents, will be prepared and strictly&#13;
followed.&#13;
Odor and noise levels in the STP and water quality (BOD, COD, dissolved oxygen (DO), SS,&#13;
oil/grease, total coliform) in receiving water will be monitored. Effluent characteristics will be&#13;
monitored as part of the treatment performance monitoring program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55                                  ANNEX 7&#13;
Septage Collection and Sea Disposal&#13;
The proposed project's septic tank evacuation and sea disposal component involves minimal&#13;
environmental risks and is the least-cost method of reducing urban pollution until the required&#13;
septage treatment capacity comes on line'&#13;
While septage collection and hauling would increase noise, odor, and other nuisances to residents,&#13;
these effects are expected to be minimal, and operational guidelines are being prepared defining&#13;
detailed work to be taken by the contractors at each stage of collection and hauling to minimize&#13;
these effects and ensure proper data collection. The guidelines will cover data collection&#13;
methods, necessary equipment and chemicals, data recording forms, health precautions, and&#13;
procedures for giving advance notice to residents. Noise during suction of septage can rise to&#13;
about 73 dBA, which is considered tolerable, and would be of short duration. A study to assess&#13;
the impact of septage hauling on the traffic in Estero de Vitas and Dagat Dagatan areas, taking&#13;
into account future road development and expansion, concluded that the impact would be small&#13;
given existing traffic levels of 1,000-5,000 cars/hr and would not increase average delays per&#13;
vehicle and cycle times or greatly decrease operating speeds along the roads leading to the sites.&#13;
The guidelines will ensure that septage with high concentrations of heavy metals and toxic&#13;
substances will not be collected during the first two years, but data on locations and types of land&#13;
use (industries, households, etc.) will be recorded. Contaminated septage would be collected and&#13;
treated in the pilot STP after it is in operation.&#13;
Contractors would be required to (a) use trucks, at least 80% of which would be equipped with&#13;
special vacuum cars, and provide periodic inspection and maintenance; (b) follow the operational&#13;
guidelines; (c) ensure safe driving and adequate training of drivers and crews to deal with spill of&#13;
septage; (d) plan work schedules and route selection to avoid rush hours and minimize collection&#13;
time; (e) have available tow trucks and effective communication systems, and (f) establish a&#13;
special team with equipment and chemicals to deal with septage spills. Training would be&#13;
required to ensure that the guidelines are followed.&#13;
Barge loading stations will be built at Napindan, Estero de Vitas, and Paranaque. Each of the&#13;
three stations would serve about 48 vehicles (mostly 4 m3 and 10 m3 vacuum trucks) a day and&#13;
each truck would bring in two to three loads of septage a day. The Napindan and Estero de Vitas&#13;
stations will be built in early 1997.&#13;
The Napindan station is located about 16 km from the Pasig river mouth; it is being used as an&#13;
equipment depot and berthing facilities are available. Construction will be limited to surface&#13;
paving and minimal excavations for site development and drainage, concreting, and pipe works.&#13;
The proposed site for Estero de Vitas at Manila North harbor.is part of R-10 road right-of-way&#13;
and is presently in temporary use as a solid waste transfer station. Construction will involve site&#13;
Five septage managent options: tmataent (physical, biological, chemical), sea disposal, lahar site disposal, dewataing, and&#13;
inineration, we revieved and teir costs re estmated. Sea disposal is the least expensive option (S15,0001m3), followed by&#13;
disposal in the lahar lava fields resulting from the Mt Pinatubo auption (I 8,000/m-the pactical applicatiom of this mehod is&#13;
sdll in the research stage) and land-based cemicalibiomnhaical frebent (S115,000/n3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                              ANNEX 7&#13;
grading, excavation, filling, and concreting works. Measurements suggested that dust levels in&#13;
the proposed sites often exceed standards, but noise levels are within standards.&#13;
The proposed sea disposal site is more than 40 km from the nearest shoreline and the water depth&#13;
is about 2,300 m. This is not a normal fishing area and is about 20 km from the nearest&#13;
navigation lane. Over November-March, the current moves (0.4-1.5 km/hr) westward away from&#13;
shore. From May to October, it moves (0.7-1.8 km/hr) toward the west coast of Luzon.&#13;
Navigation is often not possible during July-September. Sea water temperature is about 16-38 C;&#13;
density is 1.02 ton/m3; and salinity is 33.3 parts per thousand.&#13;
Deep-sea disposal of relatively benign septage is not covered by the 1972 London Convention on&#13;
the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters (LDC, ratified by&#13;
the Philippines in 1973) which controls the dumping of toxic and hazardous chemicals. The&#13;
proposed dumping site, however, meets the LDC criteria for hazardous waste disposal, and was&#13;
designated an allowable dumping site by the Philippine Coast Guard in 1991. The site is well&#13;
within Philippine national waters, and there is no question of trans-boundary pollution.&#13;
Deep-ocean disposal of septage is not unusual in industrialized countries. Japan has been using&#13;
this alternative since the mid-1930's, and dumped more than 3 million tons offshore in 1993, the&#13;
last year for which information is available. The United States and the United Kingdom also make&#13;
use of deep-ocean septage and sewage disposal.&#13;
A review of the literature on deep-ocean septage disposal - available in the project file - shows&#13;
that treated sewage disposal into open waters with high flushing characteristics has relatively little&#13;
impact on the receiving environment. Even within the mixing zones themselves, coliform and&#13;
other bacteria die off within 15 minutes of disposal. Some authors have noted that disposal may&#13;
improve the productivity of nutrient-deficient waters.&#13;
The disposal method will be similar to that being used in Japan (spread disposal), whereby&#13;
septage is pumped out (at a speed less than 0.5 m3/sec) through submerged outlets (5-7 m below&#13;
water surface) while the vessel is moving (at a speed not less than 4 knots) along a 10-km radius.&#13;
Barges would make one trip every two days.&#13;
The environmental impact during construction of barge loading stations is expected to be minor.&#13;
Under the EMP, contractors will be instructed to carry out the works with due attention to:&#13;
providing advanced notice to residents and the public before beginning construction and taking&#13;
measures to reduce noise and other impacts, including installation of proper embankments;&#13;
erecting sound-barriers around work sites; prohibiting night work, the use of large machines,&#13;
construction vehicle parking on public roads, and disposal of solid waste and other construction&#13;
materials into waterways and public places. These requirements will also be included in the&#13;
bidding and contract documents for Paranaque when it is built in 1998.&#13;
Under the proposed project, it is expected that short term aesthetic impacts (color, turbidity,&#13;
smell) will occur in the disposal area during disposal of septage. Given the water depth and&#13;
turbulence in the area, biodegradability of the septage, and the spread disposal operation, no&#13;
adverse long-term impact is likely. During the most critical period in August when the surface&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57                                ANNEX 7&#13;
currents move landward at a speed of about 1.0 knot, septage would take 10 days to reach the&#13;
nearest shoreline (Bataan) which is about 45 km from the disposal site. Over December-March,&#13;
the septage may never reach the shore as the current is outward to sea. Deposition of solids&#13;
within a 20 km radius (1,256 km2) would be 0.04 mm after 65,000 ton of septage are discharged&#13;
during the first 3 years. Some positive benefits on fish and other marine life can be expected due&#13;
to the availability of organic matter and nutrients. Water samples were collected along Bataan&#13;
and southern part of Zambales in November 1995 and tested (for oil, grease, COD, transparency,&#13;
SS, N, P, plankton, etc.) to provide background data for monitoring the impact of sea disposal.&#13;
It is anticipated that single contracts covering septage collection, hauling, and sea disposal would&#13;
facilitate smooth operation and provide flexibility to adjust work programs that would obviate the&#13;
need for costly storage facilities at the three barge loading stations.&#13;
To minimize potential barge loading problems, the stations were designed to operate as typical&#13;
load transfer stations, with pipes to convey septage from tanker trucks to barges, flushing facilities&#13;
to clean tankers with river or bay water, small offices to monitor station operations, parking&#13;
places for tankers, and barge berthing with appropriate anchorages; the layouts were designed to&#13;
facilitate smooth traffic flow and operation. The barge loading station will be the key check point&#13;
to inspect the performance of the contractors. Septage quantities would be recorded and samples&#13;
taken for laboratory analysis. The septage would be transferred to the barge through securely&#13;
fastened hoses and wastewater from washing of collection trucks would be discharged into&#13;
receptacles for eventual discharge to the barge or tanker vessel. Discharge of solid and liquid&#13;
wastes into the river would be strictly prohibited.&#13;
To ensure acceptable barge loading and sea disposal, monitoring of noise, odor, and water quality&#13;
at the barge loading stations will be carried out, as will monitoring of water quality at the disposal&#13;
site and along Bataan and southern Zambales shoreline. Appropriate actions will be taken if&#13;
adverse impacts occur. Under the EMP, routine monitoring of sea conditions (wind&#13;
direction/speed, current direction/speed) and water quality (color, transparency, oil/grease,&#13;
floating materials) will be carried out at the disposal site before and after disposal. Periodic&#13;
measurements of water quality (pH, temperature, salinity, DO, COD, oil, grease, SS, N, P,&#13;
plankton, transparency, color) and a release of drift cards at the disposal site and along the nearest&#13;
shorelines will be carried out.&#13;
An operational manual will be prepared to identify steps to be taken and the equipment required&#13;
during loading and sea disposal of septage to ensure the following: maintaining hygienic&#13;
conditions of operation and safety of workers, minimizing noise and odor impacts; prohibiting&#13;
discharge of solid and liquid wastes into the waterways and Manila Bay; proper operation and&#13;
recording of septage disposal and monitoring of possible adverse effects. An administrator will be&#13;
assigned permanently to each barge loading station to ensure efficient transfer operations,&#13;
including proper record keeping and septage sampling. Disposal of septage will be carried out&#13;
under close supervision by the Philippine Coast Guard.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                               ANNEX 7&#13;
Contractors will be required to comply with the following:&#13;
*  Vessels must be of low draft to conform to the shallow conditions in the barge loading&#13;
stations; have closed decks to prevent odor and other nuisances; and be multi-compartmented&#13;
and properly equipped to ensure stability and safety;&#13;
*  Make available clean-up facilities to take care of accidental spillage due to ship collision or&#13;
other accidents and other equipment to carry out the water quality monitoring program;&#13;
*  Follow operational guidelines for barge loading and sea disposal, carry out the disposal&#13;
operation under close supervision of PCG, and submit the record/results to MWSS;&#13;
*  Adjust the collection and barging schedule to minimize potential adverse effects.&#13;
Sewer System Rehabilitation and Upgrading&#13;
The Central and Ayala systems are old and conditions and performance are very poor. The&#13;
systems would be rehabilitated over three years, and civil works are expected to be limited. The&#13;
Ayala plant (40,000 m3/d capacity) now operates about 8 hrs a day and about 20,000 m3/d of&#13;
influent (230 mg/l BOD, 150 mg/l SS) is treated; the effluent (62 mg/l BOD, 50 mg/l SS) is&#13;
discharged into the nearby receiving water. Measurements suggested that BOD and SS levels in&#13;
the receiving water during January to May are about 62 mg/l and 50 mg/I, respectively.&#13;
The main impacts include traffic, air, noise, vibration, odor, and water pollution during&#13;
rehabilitation. To minimize these impacts, contractors will be instructed to carry out the works&#13;
with due attention to: providing advanced notice to residents and the public before construction&#13;
begins and taking actions to minimize traffic congestion and other impacts, including immediate&#13;
resurfacing after completion of works; limited use of noisy jack hammers and daytime work; and&#13;
properly trained workers.  These conditions will be included in the bidding and contract&#13;
documents.&#13;
After rehabilitation, collection capacity and efficiency of the Central system would be improved,&#13;
thus improving sanitary conditions and reducing water pollution in the service area. This would,&#13;
however, increase the level of BOD loading at the outfall area in Manila Bay. The EMP indicated&#13;
that the existing water quality monitoring at the outfall area will be continued with close&#13;
coordination with other related activities. Implementation of the sewerage and sanitation master&#13;
plan (updated in 1996) would significantly reduce BOD loading into Manila Bay.&#13;
After rehabilitation of the primary treatment unit of Ayala wastewater treatment plant, the effluent&#13;
would be 126 mg/l BOD (26% removal) and 98 mg/l SS (38% removal). Existing secondary&#13;
treatment, however, will be in operation and the final effluent wili not exceed the standards and&#13;
the water quality in the receiving water will not be worse off. Rehabilitation works will ensure&#13;
reliable operation of the primary treatment facilities which are presently in poor condition.&#13;
Rehabilitation of the secondary treatment facilities will be considered during implementation of&#13;
the master plan. Water quality in the receiving water will be monitored.&#13;

59                               ANNEX 7&#13;
Public Information And Consultation&#13;
As part of the EMP, it is anticipated that successful and timely implementation of the project will&#13;
require close consultation and coordination among concerned parties and cooperation of residents&#13;
and the public. During preparation of the project, consultation activities (publication, meetings,&#13;
hearing) were used to obtain views and comments on the project. MWSS held consultative&#13;
meetings with concerned local government officials in June 1995 and with local NGOs in&#13;
December 1995. These activities will be continued during implementation of the project with&#13;
emphasis given to (a) promoting knowledge on septic tank management and cooperation of&#13;
homeowners and (b) providing advance notice to residents and the public before the beginning of&#13;
civil works. The latter would be included in bidding and contract documents.&#13;
Implementation of Environmental Actions&#13;
The environmental actions (Table A 7-2) would be carried out by MWSS with assistance of a&#13;
consultant.&#13;

Environmental Clearance Certificates&#13;
DENR is expected to issue ECCs for the project (for septage collection and disposal, including&#13;
construction of barge loading stations; for the Dagat-Dagatan STP;and for rehabilitation of the&#13;
Central and Ayala sewer systems) by early 1996.&#13;
Deep sea disposal of septage at the proposed site will require vessel permits from the PCG. The&#13;
permits would be issued to the contractors and septage discharge would be supervised and&#13;
monitored by PCG. An operational record of the locations, amounts, and types of dumping will&#13;
be maintained by the PCG.&#13;
Monitoring and Institutional Capacity&#13;
MWSS, with the assistance of consultants and oversight by the advisory panel, would monitor&#13;
compliance with the ECCs and carry out the data collection programs for septage management.&#13;
Monitoring results would be submitted to DENR/EMB and the World Bank periodically.&#13;
The technical and laboratory capacity of MWSS would be strengthened under the project. The&#13;
central laboratory would be appropriately equipped for sample collection and analysis and the&#13;
laboratory at Dagat-Dagatan would be upgraded for routine analysis of STP performance.&#13;
DENR would periodically monitor and audit compliance with the ECCs, assisted by independent&#13;
contractors. Compliance with the sea-dumping permit would be monitored by PCG, DENR, and&#13;
MWSS.&#13;

MANILA SECOND SEWERAGE PROJECT&#13;
Assumptions for financial projections&#13;
1.    The financial statement projections are in current Philippine Pesos. Figures for 1992&#13;
through 1994 are actual. Local inflation rate of 7.0% per annum has been added for 1995, 6.5%&#13;
for 1996, 6.0% for 1997, 5.5% for 1998, and 5.0% from 1999 through to the end of the&#13;
projection period in 2002. The assumed Peso to US Dollar exchange rate for the projection&#13;
period was set at Peso 25.00 equals US$1.00.&#13;
Income Statement&#13;
2.    Revenues: Sewerage charges have been projected to increase in line with estimated&#13;
increased water supply volumes, plus 10,000 additional sewer house connections, and annual&#13;
increases of sewerage tariffs. Environmental charges have been projected to increase in line with&#13;
estimated increased water supply volumes, and annual increases of sewerage tariffs. Water supply&#13;
volumes are projected to increase with additional production facilities; NRW is projected to be&#13;
53.5% in 1995, 53.0% for 1996 and 1997, 50.0% for 1998 and 1999, 49.0% for 2000, and reduce&#13;
by three percent per annum thereafter. Tariffs Average water supply and sewerage tariffs&#13;
including CERA are assumed to increase by 12% in 1995; by 33% in 1996, and by local annual&#13;
inflation thereafter.&#13;
3.    Operational Costs: Wages The projections include wages and benefits for SSD staff, and&#13;
an apportionment of MWSS staff costs relative to the work performed on behalf of sewerage&#13;
operations. Power Projected to increase in line with new barge stations operation, and new STP&#13;
operation. Supplies and materials/other costs Projected expenses increased in line with additional&#13;
operation and maintenance activities to be undertaken by SSD. Septage collection/disposal/sea&#13;
dumping The projections cover the contractors' costs of desludging septic tanks and disposal of&#13;
the septage at sea and at STP. Septage treatment The projections include all costs to cover&#13;
septage treatment and final disposal of the sludge. Provision for bad debts Based on past&#13;
experience, this has been estimated at 5% per annum. Franchise and income taxes MWSS has&#13;
been exempt these taxes since inception, but exempt status is presently under review by GOP.&#13;
Based on the present position of negotiations between GOP and MWSS, the projections assume&#13;
that these taxes will be levied effective from FY96 and the amounts will be returned by GOP in&#13;
the form of a government subsidy. Depreciation The calculation of 2.50% per annum has been&#13;
made on the weighted average of all fixed assets in operation.&#13;
Balance Sheet&#13;
4.    Fixed assets Include network, pumping station, lift stations and wastewater treatment&#13;
plant, with additions of plant and equipment when new assets are placed in service, and are&#13;
revalued at annual projected inflation rates. Accounts receivable Based on past experience and&#13;
new measures already in hand, it is assumed that accounts receivable will reduce from an average&#13;
of 110 days to 90 days sales by 2002. Accounts payable Historical figures have been projected to&#13;

PHILIPPINES&#13;
MANILA SECOND SEWERAGE PROJECT&#13;
Project Performance Monitoring&#13;
The Manila Second Sewerage Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) system - which will be&#13;
confirmed at negotiations - is designed to provide project managers with information on progress&#13;
toward project objectives, impact on beneficiaries, and information on institutional, technical and&#13;
financial aspects that could be useflul in developing a long-term sewerage and septage&#13;
management plan for MWSS. It has two basic components:&#13;
* On-the-ground monitoring of septage collection and conveyance in consultation with&#13;
stakeholders;&#13;
* More traditional tracking of project milestones in terms of measuring progress&#13;
achieved against specific targets proposed in the project implementation action plan&#13;
(Annex 5);&#13;
Monitoring Septage Management and Disposal&#13;
One measure of project success will be the extent to which neighborhood residents and the larger&#13;
environmental community find the cleaning of septic tanks and removal/disposal of septage&#13;
beneficial to the urban environment. A possible model for involving beneficiaries and other&#13;
stakehoiders in project monitoring could be the December 1995 round table meeting organized by&#13;
DENR and MWSS with Philippine NGOs. The meeting discussed project design and its possible&#13;
environmental impact and debated the issues until a consensus on the benefits from the project&#13;
emerged.&#13;
At the neighborhood (barangay) level, the consultative role is equally significant as a means of&#13;
monitoring the performance of the private contractors who will collect and remove septage from&#13;
neighborhoods and secondary drainage systems. Service quality in terms of reliability and speed,&#13;
absence of short-dumping in neighborhood drains, etc. need to be periodically checked with&#13;
community groups. Socio-economic data on the residents of the project area will also be&#13;
collected, so that indicators of residents' access to, use of, and payment for water and septage&#13;
removal services are available. These indicators could be evaluated with reference to baseline&#13;
social and economic conditions of the community (such as tenurial status, income levels,&#13;
occupational data, health information etc.) so that the question of whether equitable distribution&#13;
of benefits is taking place is closely monitored.&#13;
Monitoring performance on the septage management components will include:&#13;
* Close monitoring of performance under the Environmental Management Plan (see&#13;
Annex 7);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71                               ANNEX 11&#13;
* MWSS establishmnent of a Technical Review Panel to evaluate septage data generated&#13;
by the project;&#13;
*   Annual roundtable meetings with NGO groups on the format of the first meeting held&#13;
in December 1995; and&#13;
*   Semi-annual consultations with beneficiaries at the neighborhood level;&#13;
Monitoring Physical and Financial Progress&#13;
Table 1 describes performance indicators for monitoring financial and physical progress, Table 2&#13;
shows the monitoring responsibilities of various stakeholders, Table 3 shows numerical targets for&#13;
project performance indicators and Table 4 shows the key performance indicators agreed during&#13;
project negotiations. The indicators, which can be either numeric or qualitative, are classified in&#13;
the following categories:&#13;
(a) Input or process indicators describe how and when resources provided through the project are&#13;
translated into investment activities.&#13;
(b) Output indicators describe the measured results in terms of improved sewerage and septage&#13;
disposal services&#13;
Table 1 lists these indicators for the Project.&#13;
(c) Outcome indicators assess how far actual project performance compares against project&#13;
targets. Table 3 lists the project target indicators against which these outcomes can be evaluated.&#13;
The outcome indicators, which will be partly quantitative and partly qualitative, would evaluate&#13;
success and failure in relation to the target indicators.&#13;
(d) Impact indicators evaluate how far the development objectives were accomplished. These&#13;
evaluations, which are generally qualitative in nature, will analyze causes of successes and failures&#13;
as indicated by the outcome indicators, and explain impacts in terms of what worked and what did&#13;
not work in the project. This exercise will involve all the key stakeholders reporting on their&#13;
respective areas of M&amp;E responsibility (see Table 2). Project supervision and review meetings&#13;
will provide an opportunity to assess impacts during the project implementation cycle, so that the&#13;
project design could be altered or modified in case some project rules appear to be unworkable.&#13;

SUMMARY OF M&amp;E RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
Table 2 below shows how M&amp;E responsibilities can be shared among the different stakeholders at&#13;
the national, project and community levels. This division of responsibilities provides a useful basis&#13;
to organize stakeholder meetings during the project cycle, particularly during the outcome and&#13;
impact evaluation stages.&#13;
The first row represents how information could flow to the policy level on an annual basis. This&#13;
could be based on annual reports on project performance, Bank supervision missions and annual&#13;
roundtable meetings with NGOs. The second row represents the responsibilities of the project's&#13;
primary stakeholders; the project management team in MWSS and the beneficiaries in the project&#13;
areas at the neighborhood levels. Beneficiaries will provide feedback to not only ensure local&#13;
ownership, but also to ensure that the interests of different social g-oups (such as squatter&#13;
households, women's groups etc.) are adequately represented. The third row indicates the&#13;
responsibilities of other agencies and individuals who could also provide useful feedback on&#13;
specific aspects of project performance and impacts. Implementation details of the feedback&#13;
mechanisms will be discussed and finalized at negotiations.&#13;

MANILA SECOND SEWERAGE PROJECT&#13;
Rate of return&#13;
Economic rate of return&#13;
1.    The three project components (septage management program, sewer system rehabilitation&#13;
and new sewer connections) yield benefits in terms of information required for future system&#13;
design and improvements in public health and urban environmental and living conditions. The&#13;
majority of these benefits cannot be adequately quantified in physical or monetary terms. As such,&#13;
an economic rate of return based on a full cost-benefit analysis cannot be calculated for the&#13;
project and the investment is justified based on a least-cost analysis.&#13;
2.    However, stylized analysis can be carried out to yield order-of-magnitude estimates of&#13;
economic rate of return based on simplifying assumptions. The key assumption pertains to the&#13;
monetary value of economic benefits. It is assumed that (a) existing charges levied by MWSS for&#13;
sewer service and septic tank maintenance (sewerage and environmental surcharges on the water&#13;
bill) reflect consumer willingness to pay and are a measure of total economic benefits (private and&#13;
public) to households; and (b) that without adequate maintenance and proper operation (to be&#13;
ensured through project investments), full economic benefits from existing assets are not realized&#13;
even though the surcharges are paid in full. The first assumption is a conservative one because&#13;
households may be expected to undervalue public benefits. Nor will household willingness to pay&#13;
include the value of the information obtained to design the sewerage system in the future.&#13;
Therefore, the computed economic rates of returns would be under-estimated. Separate analyses&#13;
are carried out for the three project components.&#13;
3.    For purposes of the stylized analysis, it is not necessary to be overly precise. Table A.&#13;
12.1 shows the rounded base values used in the analysis. Latest full year (without project) costs&#13;
and revenues for SSD are taken from 1994 accounts. O&amp;M costs total P 150 million; budget data&#13;
are used to allocate P 100 million to sewer services (col. a) and P 50 million to septic tank&#13;
maintenance services (col. b). Revenues total P 600 million of which P 300 million come from&#13;
100,000 sewer connections (col. c) and P 300 million from environment charges paid for by&#13;
households with 1 million water connections (col. d). The Table also shows the capital and&#13;
recurring costs related to investments in the proposed project. Capital costs of the new sewer&#13;
connections and the sewer system rehabilitation are indicated in columns e and f Columns g&#13;
through j represent the costs associated with the septage management component: Column g&#13;
shows the recurring costs due to septage collection and haulage; column h shows the recurring&#13;
costs of barging which terminates in year 7 (2003); column i shows the capital costs of the pilot&#13;
STP and the other STPs to be constructed later to replace sea disposal; and column j shows the&#13;
recurring costs of operating the STPs. Capital investments required for treatment plant capacity,&#13;
in addition to the pilot plant to be constructed as part of the proposed project, are assumed to be&#13;
made one year before the capacity is scheduled, i.e, in 2001, 2002, 2003 2005 and 2007. Both&#13;
capital and recurring costs are extrapolated from cost estimates used for the pilot treatment plant&#13;
included in the proposed project, allowing for reasonable economies of scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77                               ANNEX 12&#13;
4.    All rates of return are computed using the with and without project costs shown in Table&#13;
A. 12.1. The economic rate of return for the 10,000 new sewer connections is simple to compute&#13;
since both costs and revenues (additional revenue from sewer surcharge is prorated based on the&#13;
existing average revenue per sewer connection) are well defined. It is assumed that incremental&#13;
revenues start to accrue after all investment is complete. Two alternative assumptions are made&#13;
regarding O&amp;M costs. If costs are assumed not to increase (because MWSS is over-staffed), the&#13;
IRR is 10%; if costs are assumed to increase in proportion to the number of new connections, i.e.,&#13;
by 10%, the IRR falls to 4%.&#13;
5.    For the sewer rehabilitation component, alternative scenarios are based on assumptions&#13;
pertaining to percentage of economic benefits realized without the project (i.e., percentage of&#13;
column c) and increase in O&amp;M costs required to maintain the full benefit stream after the project.&#13;
Incremental revenues are assumed to start accruing after completion of investment. If costs&#13;
increase by 25%, the IRR is 19%, 16% or 12% depending upon whether 40%, 50% or 60%,&#13;
respectively, of the full economic benefits were being realized without the project.  The&#13;
corresponding values for the IRR in the scenario where costs are assumed to increase by 50% are&#13;
12%, 8% and 4%. The rate of return is fairly sensitive to the extent of inefficiency caused by lack&#13;
of adequate maintenance.&#13;
6.    For the septic tank maintenance component, the economic rate of return is computed for&#13;
the case where sea dumping is used as the disposal method on a permanent basis. Since&#13;
approximately one-tenth of existing septic tanks are to be desludged annually, the full benefits are&#13;
restored linearly over a ten year period. Depending upon whether existing septic tanks are&#13;
assumed to be yielding 10%, 20% or 30% of full benefits (i.e. percentage of column d),&#13;
restoration of full benefits after the project yields an economic rate of return of 12%, 9% or 5%,&#13;
respectively. The rate of return becomes negative if septic tanks are assumed to be yielding 40%&#13;
of full benefits without the project.&#13;
7.    Cessation of sea dumping in 2003 and recourse to septage treatment plants causes costs to&#13;
exceed benefits as measured by existing household payments. If consumers agree with the&#13;
cessation of sea disposal, the excess cost could be interpreted as the cost society is prepared to&#13;
pay to avoid the any risk of marine pollution. The steady state O&amp;M costs would be of the order&#13;
of US$3 .0 per household per month compared to existing payments of approximately US$1.0 per&#13;
household per year.&#13;
8.    For both the sewer rehabilitation and septic tank maintenance components, it would be&#13;
reasonable to assume that the life of the existing assets, and therefore the length of the benefit&#13;
stream, would be prolonged after the project investments. However, the economic rate of returns&#13;
were not much affected by assumptions regarding such changes.&#13;
Financial break-even analysis&#13;
9.    The assumptions and data supporting the financial analysis are presented in Table A 12.2.&#13;
The computation of the financial break-even analysis is shown in Table A 12.3. The calculation&#13;
shows that an increase of 35% in the water tariff (and of indexed sewerage tariff and&#13;
&#13;

environmental charge), results in sufficient incremental revenue for the SSD, in addition to the&#13;
revenue from the 10,000 new sewer connections, to fully cover the costs of the project. Sea&#13;
disposal of septage is assumed to continue throughout the period of analysis in order to compute&#13;
the tariff increase necessary to recover the costs due to the proposed project. Further tariff&#13;
increase would be required when sea disposal is fully replaced by treatment and disposal in&#13;
sanitary landfills in the second phase of the septic tank maintenance program.&#13;

            Philippines - Manila Second Sewerage Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Manila Second Sewerage Project is
            intended to help the government improve the quality of
            sanitation services and enable the Metropolitan Waterworks
            and Sewerage System to: 1) radically expand its septage
            management program and establish the conditions needed for
            medium-term low-cost improvement of sewerage services in
            Metro Manila (MM); and 2) reduce pollution in MM waterways
            and Manila Bay, thereby reducing the health hazards
            associated with human exposure to excreta.  The project will
            include the following components: 1) building of three large
            loading stations for septage disposal at sea under a private
            collection and disposal contract; 2) building of a pilot
            septage treatment plant; 3) rehabilitation of the Central
            and the Ayala sewerage systems, the Ayala treatment plant,
            and construction of about 10,000 individual sewer
            connections; and 4) provision of maintenance equipment,
            tools, spare parts and laboratory instruments.
            Implementation support will include: 1) construction
            supervision and environmental monitoring and management
            assistance; 2) preparation of designs and documents for the
            follow-up expansion of the sewerage system and septage
            treatment plants; and 3) preparation of documents for the
            Third Manila Water Supply Project.
