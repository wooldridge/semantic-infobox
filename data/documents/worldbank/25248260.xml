THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: OECD high income&#13;

regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: High income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 11,225,207&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 47,030&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 43&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 41*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 72.39&#13;

absolute terms, while the ease of doing business ranking       and the changes in methodology. See the data notes&#13;
can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

What are the details?&#13;
Underlying the indicators shown in this chapter for&#13;

Belgium is a set of specific proceduresâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;

must complete to incorporate and register a new                  Legal form: SociÃ©tÃ© privÃ©e Ã  responsabilitÃ©&#13;

information on business entry in that economy.                   Paid-in minimum capital requirement: EUR&#13;
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,             6,200&#13;
along with the associated time and cost. These                   City: Brussels&#13;

collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on&#13;
what the indicators measure).&#13;

       Deposit at least 20% of the initial capital with a Belgian credit&#13;
       institution and obtain a standard certification confirming that the&#13;
       amount is held in a blocked â&#128;&#156;capitalâ&#128;&#157; account&#13;
&#13;
       The full amount of capital must be fully and unconditionally subscribed,&#13;
       but it does not have to be immediately paid in unless the capital&#13;
       contribution is fully in kind. However, by law, a fifth of the total capital&#13;
       paid-in cash (no less than EUR 6,200) must be paid in.&#13;
&#13;
       For those private limited liability companies incorporated by only one&#13;
   1   shareholder, the amount of the capital to be paid in is EUR 12,400. In          1 day           no charge&#13;
       some cases, the paid-in and minimum capital can be reduced to EUR 1.&#13;
       Indeed, the Belgian legislation allows, when certain conditions are&#13;
       present, to set-up a limited liability company (called SPRL Starter /BVBA&#13;
       Starter) without the minimum capital and paid-in capital of the&#13;
       SPRL/BVBA (article 214, Â§2 Company). However, this does not apply to&#13;

        The company may request the VAT registration number either directly&#13;
        from the local VAT administration or through the centralized company&#13;
        docket, which can apply for the VAT registration number electronically&#13;
        (but in both cases, the VAT registration number will be granted by the&#13;
        VAT administration). The VAT registration and social security&#13;
        registration are done through a single enterprise number. The company&#13;
        therefore only needs to request the activation of the enterprise number&#13;
        as VAT registration number, if necessary for its activities. This activation&#13;
        can be done by the one-stop shop or directly by the VAT&#13;
        administration.&#13;
&#13;
        As of 1 April 2010, the company must register with the social insurance&#13;
        fund for self-employed persons ("caisse d'assurances sociales pour&#13;
        travailleurs indÃ©pendants" / "sociale verzekeringskas voor&#13;
        zelfstandigen") at the latest on the day of the start of the activities, and&#13;
        no longer within 3 months of incorporation. It must pay into this fund&#13;
        an annual contribution of EUR 868 at most. In addition, if the company&#13;
        has employees in Belgium, it must register with the Belgian social&#13;
        security administration for salaried workers (ONSS/RSZ) and comply&#13;
        with all applicable Belgian employment regulations.&#13;
&#13;
        The fee for registering a company is EUR 82.5 for the main business&#13;
        entity and EUR 82.5 for every additional business unit to be registered&#13;
        with the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises.&#13;
        VAT registration is (a) free of charge if done directly through the local&#13;
        VAT office and (b) EUR 55 (VAT excluded) if done through a one-stop&#13;
        shop (company docket).&#13;

        Obtain a recent proof of land ownership&#13;
&#13;
        The administration must check two items:&#13;
        1. That the person requesting the building permit has the right&#13;
        to do so. He might not necessarily be the owner of the land, but&#13;
        acting on behalf of the owner.&#13;
        2. The applicant must submit a recent list of neighboring plots. In&#13;
        case of inquiry they should be able to consult the neighbors.&#13;

        Therefore, the cadastral extract must be recent. Although the&#13;
        town has access to cadastral plans, the applicant must still obtain&#13;
        a recent cadastral extract. It costs around 50-100 Euros and it&#13;
        takes a maximum of 15 days to obtain it.&#13;

      The Urbanism Department has 30 days to inform the applicant&#13;
      that the application is not complete. After that period, the&#13;
      administration has another 3 months, depending on the type of&#13;
      construction to deliver the "permis d'urbanism." Other&#13;
      clearances are required such as obtaining clearance from&#13;
      VIVAQUA for sewage, obtaining information regarding the&#13;
      sewage and the depth at which the sewage pipes are located.&#13;
      This can take another 30 days. Contacting VIVAQUA is done by&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;
                                                                 Submitting all relevant documents and&#13;

&#13;
        There is no external inspection. However, before the external connection&#13;
        works and the turn-on of the meter, the internal wiring of the warehouse&#13;
        must be inspected by an approved agency such as Vincotte or BTV. The&#13;
        customer has to make that request. The customer or a representative has      1 calendar day     EUR 212.19&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;
qualitative information on the mechanisms put in           duration and frequency of power outages in the largest&#13;
place by the utility for monitoring power outages          business city of each economy (for 11 economies the data&#13;
and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;
greater transparency of tariffs.&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

       Parties give initial sale agreement to notary&#13;
&#13;
       The transfer of ownership can be done by an agreement between seller&#13;
       and buyer. However, in order to validate the transfer of ownership vis-Ã -&#13;
       vis third parties, the initial agreement needs to be notarized and&#13;
       registered with the mortgage register by a notary. The notary will draw&#13;
       up a deed and obtain all necessary documentation (see following&#13;
       Procedures). The notary also checks, for companies, the copy of the&#13;
       publication of the names of the directors in the Belgian Official Gazette.                        Included in&#13;

      The notary obtains tax certificates relating to the seller's tax position&#13;
      from the Inland Revenue, the VAT authorities and the municipal tax&#13;
      collector relating to the seller's tax position. A request for this&#13;
      information can be submitted online, but the response will arrive 15 days&#13;
      later. If there is no answer within 12 working days, the notary can process&#13;
      the deed anyway, therefore assuming there are no tax issues. The only&#13;
      tax information which still needs to be asked by registered letter is the&#13;
      municipal or provincial tax information. Since April 2007, the request             15 days&#13;
      could be submitted online but the response would still arrive within 15        (simultaneous         EUR 60 (included&#13;

      every social security fund (there are +/- 15 of them). However, this&#13;
      process is done electronically, simultaneously with the verification of the&#13;
      tax position. The Procedure is integrated in the existing Procedure&#13;
      related to the tax position of the seller. The time needed for this&#13;
      verification is 15 days as well. It takes place fully electronically, just as&#13;

      (valid) request to obtain a soil certificate. The seller of an immoveable&#13;
      good has to ask the Brussels environmental authorities (BIM) for a soil&#13;
      certificate (attestation du sol/bodemattest) which he has to transmit to&#13;
      the buyer before the conclusion of the private sale agreement&#13;
      (compromis de vente). For some type of lands, an expert must examine&#13;
      the land to check whether the soil is polluted ("reconnaissance du sol&#13;
      /verkennend bodemonderzoek"). On basis of the results of this survey,&#13;
      BIM decides whether the transfer can take place without any further&#13;
      measure or whether the condition of the soil requires additional&#13;
      measures to be taken (e.g. clean-up). If additional measures have to be&#13;
      taken, the transfer can nevertheless take place before the clean-up if&#13;
      some conditions are fulfilled. This new Act is a transposition of European&#13;
      legislation (article 17Â§2 of the Ordinance of 5 March 2009).&#13;

      * The new Brussels legislation on soil clean-up obliges a seller of real&#13;
      estate to conduct a soil survey for lands where pollution is suspected, if&#13;
      clean-up is deemed necessary by the Brussels environmental authorities&#13;
      (BIM), to perform clean-up measures prior to transferring the polluted&#13;
      site. Contrary to the Flemish Region (where property rights may be&#13;
      transferred as soon as sufficient financial guarantees are in place), the&#13;
      Brussels statute on soil clean-up does not allow to proceed with the&#13;
      transfer before the actual clean-up works have been completed.&#13;
&#13;
      * The pre-emption rights exist in some predetermined areas of the&#13;
      Flemish and Brussels Region. The seller or the notary notifies the&#13;
      competent administration (GRONDREGIE / REGIE FONCIERE ) as soon as&#13;
      he receives the "compromis". These administrations then have 2 months&#13;
      to decide whether to exercise their pre-emption right. Some pre-&#13;
      emption rights also exist in the Walloon Region. The areas in Brussels&#13;
      where needed to obtain a waiver for preemption are specified in the&#13;

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous&#13;
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost&#13;
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary&#13;
requirements than does the number of documents required.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

Proceedin reorganization The reorganization plan may involve the reduction and/or postponement of the&#13;
g                               claim of unsecured creditors. With respect to the secured creditor, the&#13;
                          reorganization plan cannot provide for a reduction of its claim. However, it can&#13;
                         provide for the suspension, without its express consent, of its rights (with regard&#13;
                          to the principal amount) for a period of up to 24 months from the filing date of&#13;
                            the petition, which period can be extended once for 12 months under certain&#13;
                         conditions, without prejudice to the right of these creditors to receive interest on&#13;
                           their claims. No other measures can be provided for in the reorganization plan&#13;
                                            without the secured creditors' express consent.&#13;

Doing Business presents results for two aggregate             even though it is no longer at the frontier in a&#13;

doing business ranking, which is based on the distance&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

practice across the entire sample of 36 indicators for 10     extreme outliers in the distributions of the rescaled data&#13;
Doing Business topics (the labor market regulation            for most component indicators (very few economies&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;
economy involves two main steps. In the first step            depth of credit information index, extent of conflict of&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Belgium
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Belgium.
            To allow for useful comparison, the profile also provides
            data for other selected economies (comparator economies) for
            each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the 13th edition in a
            series of annual reports measuring the regulations that
            enhance business activity and those that constrain it.
            Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business; for
            2015 Belgium ranks 43. A high ease of doing business ranking
            means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the
            starting and operation of a local firm. Doing Business
            presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and
            the protection of property rights that can be compared
            across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over
            time. Doing Business sheds light on how easy or difficult it
            is for a local entrepreneur to open and run a small to
            medium-size business when complying with relevant
            regulations. It measures and tracks changes in regulations
            affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a business: starting
            a business, dealing with construction permits, getting
            electricity, registering property, getting credit,
            protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across
            borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency and labor
            market regulation. The data in this report are current as of
            June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes indicators, which
            cover the period from January to December 2014).
