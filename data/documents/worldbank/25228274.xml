                 Haiti learns from Indonesia about community-&#13;
                 driven development and housing reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
                 The 2010 earthquake that hit Haiti wiped out the nationâ&#128;&#153;s housing infrastructure.&#13;
                 Before the Government of Haiti could begin major reconstruction, it needed to&#13;
                 shelter those whoâ&#128;&#153;d lost their homes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Indonesiaâ&#128;&#148;which like many middle income countries has been organizing itself&#13;
                 to share lessons from decades of development experienceâ&#128;&#148;had a great deal&#13;
                 of practical knowledge to share with Haiti. The 2004 tsunami and subsequent&#13;
                 earthquakes in Indonesia shattered shorelines and also shook its buildings to the&#13;
                 ground. The key to rebuilding turned out to be Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s community driven&#13;
                 development (CDD) programs, which empowered local Indonesian communities&#13;
                 to take charge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Through a South-South Facility grant, the World Bank connected Haitian officials&#13;
                 and technical experts to counterparts in Indonesia to learn how to implement&#13;
                 CDD reconstruction programs. The exchange inspired Haiti to amend existing&#13;
                 housing policies, formulate new policies to facilitate reconstruction, and develop&#13;
                 a blueprint for housing units.&#13;

                 Pakistan helps Nepal&#13;
                 stress test its banks&#13;
&#13;
                 By 2009 financial experts could see that banks in Nepal were dangerously over-&#13;
                 exposed to inflated real estate and equity markets. Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB)â&#128;&#148;&#13;
                 Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s Central Bankâ&#128;&#148;needed assistance to evaluate the countryâ&#128;&#153;s commercial&#13;
                 banks and assess the damages that could result from economic shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 But there was a problem: models used in developed economies for evaluating&#13;
                 banks were unsuited to the circumstances of a small developing country, and an&#13;
                 international search for help would take too long and be too public. Nepal need-&#13;
                 ed help quickly and quietly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Seeing this dangerous state of affairs, the World Bank connected the NRB to&#13;
                 experts from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) who demonstrated a simple model&#13;
                 for evaluating and stress testing bank exposure. â&#128;&#156;[NRB] needed to know what the&#13;
                 impact would be on banks if the bubble [in real estate and equity prices] were to&#13;
                 burst,â&#128;&#157; said Shamsuddin Ahmad, Senior Financial Sector Specialist with the World&#13;
                 Bank. â&#128;&#156;But they didnâ&#128;&#153;t know how to do it. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t have the tools.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 The skills NRB staff acquired through the exchange enabled the Central Bank to&#13;
                 quantify the level of risk to which Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s banks were exposed, pass regulations&#13;
                 to maintain financial stability, and helped the Government of Nepal establish con-&#13;
                 tingency plans in the case of a bank failure. All this in just 6 weeks!&#13;

                 Increasing transparency in extractive&#13;
                 industriesâ&#128;&#148;knowledge exchange between civil&#13;
                 society organizations in Yemen and Kazakhstan&#13;
&#13;
                 In Yemenâ&#128;&#148;where oil accounts for 25 percent of GDP, 70 percent of government&#13;
                 revenue, and over 85 percent of export earningsâ&#128;&#148;transparency and accountabil-&#13;
                 ity in the extractive sectors is crucial for good governance. In 2007 Yemen was the&#13;
                 first country from the Middle East to join the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Extractive Industries&#13;
                 Transparency Initiative (EITI), but progress stalled almost immediately due to dis-&#13;
                 agreements between oil, gas, and mining companies and civil society organiza-&#13;
                 tions (CSOs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Seeking to build momentum, the World Bank brought key Yemeni stakeholders&#13;
                 together with peers in Kazakhstan, which also relies heavily on extractive indus-&#13;
                 tries. Kazakhstani participants demonstrated to the Yemeni CSO coalition how to&#13;
                 promote transparency to extractive companies and parliament, resolve disputes,&#13;
                 and foster civil societyâ&#128;&#153;s role in reporting and auditing. The exchange renewed&#13;
                 support and momentum for EITI in Yemen, improved collaboration among indus-&#13;
                 try, civil society, and government, and helped ensure the continued partnership&#13;
                 of the donor community. Soon after the exchange, Yemen was validated as an&#13;
                 EITI partner and subsequent reports have openly verified company payments and&#13;
                 government revenues in the oil, gas, and mining sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 â&#128;&#156;We finally understood that we shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t fight among ourselves, but we should&#13;
                  unite and have a common position,â&#128;&#157; said Tawfik Al-Budiji, CSO Coalition leader&#13;
                  from Yemen.&#13;
