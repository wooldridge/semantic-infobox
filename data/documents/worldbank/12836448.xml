&#13;
&#13;
1.1 Introduction&#13;
In December 2006, the Water and Sanitation Program                   potentially reaching more than 250 million people in more than&#13;
(WSP) began implementation of two related large-scale sani-          20 countries by 2020.&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project and the Global                 approaches at scale and have four main objectives:&#13;
Scaling Up Rural Sanitation Project. The goal of the hand-              · Design and support the implementation of innova-&#13;
washing project is to reduce the risk of diarrhea and therefore            tive large-scale, sustainable handwashing programs&#13;
increase household productivity by stimulating and sustain-                in four diverse countries (Peru, Senegal, Tanzania,&#13;
ing the behavior of handwashing with soap at critical times in             and Vietnam).&#13;
5.4 million people in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam.             · Document and learn about the impact and sustainabil-&#13;
Thus, on average, the project will improve the handwashing                 ity of innovative large-scale handwashing programs.&#13;
behavior of over one million people per country.                        · Learn about the most effective and sustainable ap-&#13;
                                                                           proaches to triggering, scaling up, and sustaining&#13;
Handwashing with soap at critical times (such as after con-                handwashing with soap behaviors.&#13;
tact with feces and before handling food) has been shown to             · Promote and enable the adoption of effective hand-&#13;
substantially reduce the incidence of diarrhea. It reduces                 washing programs in other countries and--through&#13;
health risks even when families do not have access to basic                the translation of results and lessons learned--&#13;
sanitation and water supply service. Despite this benefit,                 position handwashing as a global public health&#13;
rates of handwashing with soap at critical times are very low              priority into effective advocacy and applied knowl-&#13;

&#13;
The project aims to test whether this handwashing behavior           The handwashing project also aims to complement and im-&#13;
can be improved among the poor and vulnerable using innova-          prove upon existing hygiene behavior change and hand-&#13;
tive promotional approaches. In addition, it will undertake a        washing approaches, and to enhance them with novel&#13;
structured learning and dissemination process to develop the         approaches, including commercial marketing, to deliver&#13;
evidence, practical knowledge, and tools needed to effectively       handwashing with soap messages, along with broad and in-&#13;
replicate and scale up future handwashing programs.                  clusive partnerships of government, private commercial&#13;

WSP's vision of success is that at the end of project we will have   NGOs. These innovative methods will be combined with&#13;

to a sub-set of communities can ensure the treatment and comparison groups are&#13;
equal, on average,1 and thus an appropriate counterfactual can be measured. A ran-&#13;
domized experimental evaluation with a comparison group is valuable because it&#13;
reduces the possibility that observed before-and-after changes in the intervention&#13;
group are due to factors external to the intervention. If no control group is main-&#13;
tained and a simple pre-to post-assessment is conducted of the project, one cannot&#13;
attribute changes in outcomes to the intervention with certainty.&#13;
&#13;
The use of a random control group also helps to prevent other problems that affect&#13;
our inference about the effects of the intervention. For example, communities chosen&#13;
purposively as areas with a high likelihood of success for programs such as the project&#13;
because of favorable local conditions (strong leadership, existing water and sanitation&#13;
infrastructure, highly educated population, etc.) are likely to be different from areas&#13;
that are considered less desirable for implementation. If a non-random control group&#13;
is used, a comparison of treated and untreated areas would confuse the program im-&#13;
pact with pre-existing differences, such as different hygiene habits, lower motivation,&#13;
or other factors that are difficult to observe. This is known as selection bias. A random&#13;
control group avoids these difficulties by ensuring that the communities that receive&#13;

2.2 Study Design&#13;
In order to assess the impact of each of the components of the project in the                                               In order to assess the impact of each&#13;

ously mentioned, in order to evaluate and identify the health impacts of each&#13;
component, a counterfactual to T1 and T2 is needed, which we refer to as the&#13;
Control (C). The three groups, T1, T2, and C include households with children&#13;
under two years old at the time of the baseline.&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, the evaluation assesses the isolated impact of one subcomponent of                                            Additionally, the evaluation&#13;
T2: the promotion of handwashing behavior in primary schools, implemented in                                                assesses the isolated impact of one&#13;
a limited number of schools. This school effect can be estimated by comparing                                               subcomponent of T2: the promotion&#13;
                                                                                                                            of handwashing behavior in primary&#13;

where handwashing promotion is not offered. Thus, to evaluate the impact of the&#13;
school subcomponent, two additional groups are necessary: Treatment 2 in&#13;
Schools (T2-Schools) and an extra counterfactual (C-Schools).&#13;
&#13;
This design allows us to investigate the impact of T1 and T2 (relative to con-&#13;
trol districts), and also enables us to investigate the differential impact on&#13;

    Technically, this is only true with infinite sample sizes, which is unaffordable and unnecessary. Instead, this study&#13;
    seeks to minimize the risk that the means of the treatment and comparison groups differ significantly. For details of&#13;
    mean comparison tests across treatment and control groups, please see Annex 3: Test of Baseline Balance.&#13;

                                                          The primary objective of the project is to improve the health and welfare of young&#13;
    The sample size (total number of                      children. The sample size (total number of households) was chosen to capture a&#13;

                                                          for household members of all age ranges and the corresponding data analysis was&#13;

&#13;
                                                          Power calculations indicated that, in order to capture a 20 percent reduction in&#13;

                                                          be surveyed. Therefore, since the evaluation consists of three treatment groups&#13;
                                                          and two control groups, the final sample incorporates approximately 3,000&#13;

                                                          was conducted. An additional 500 households were added to the sample size in&#13;
                                                          order to address potential attrition (loss of participants during the project);&#13;
                                                          thus the minimal necessary sample size was 3,500 households (around 700&#13;

The household survey was based on cluster sampling, and included a total of&#13;
120 districts chosen among 80 provinces (both choices made at random). The&#13;

&#13;
In addition to the household survey, fecal samples from children under two years&#13;
old, water samples taken from caregiver and child's hand rinses, drinking water,&#13;
and a sentinel toy were collected with the purpose of assessing the health status of&#13;
children and the level of fecal contamination in the household. These measures&#13;
were taken from a subsample of 160 households. Structured observations of&#13;
handwashing behavior were also collected in the same subset of 160 households.&#13;

                                              3.1 Geographic Representativeness&#13;
                                              The purpose of the IE design was to evaluate the causal effect of the intervention on&#13;
                                              a set of outcomes. As previously discussed, a randomized experimental design was&#13;
                                              used to ensure an accurate comparison between treatment and control groups.&#13;
                                              Thus, the evaluation design was intended to be representative of the population&#13;
                                              targeted by the intervention, rather than representative of the Peruvian&#13;
                                              population.&#13;
&#13;
     The sample included in the IE study      The sample included in the IE study is not representative of the Peruvian popula-&#13;

                                              sentative. Because populations differ across provinces and districts, the three-stage&#13;
     districts was random and not weighted&#13;
     by population.                           sampling design introduced a type of bias (with respect to geographical representa-&#13;
                                              tiveness) because selection probabilities varied across administrative units.&#13;
&#13;
                                              In addition to the national scale, the sample is likewise not representative at the&#13;
                                              provincial, district, or household levels, due to the following reasons:&#13;
                                                  · At the provincial level, Lima and Pisco were excluded from the overall&#13;
                                                    sample of provinces, and out of the total 195 provinces in the country,&#13;
                                                    only 80 provinces were selected (less than half of the total provinces).&#13;
                                                  · Similarly, at the district level, only 120 districts were selected from over 1,800&#13;
                                                    districts in Peru (less than 10 percent of the total number of districts). More-&#13;
                                                    over, the sample only included districts with populations between 1,500 and&#13;
                                                    100,000 inhabitants. An additional characteristic of the districts included in&#13;
                                                    the IE sample is that they all had at least one primary school. Each of these&#13;
                                                    factors suggests that selected districts need not be representative of all districts.&#13;

       · Lastly, at the household level, between 15 and 20 households were selected&#13;
         per district. Although the size of the district was taken into consideration&#13;
         in choosing the exact number of households, the population per district&#13;
         was not precisely weighted for representativeness. Rather, the criteria were:&#13;
         10 households for districts under 2,250 residents; 15 households for dis-&#13;
         tricts between 2,250­6,000 residents; and 20 households for districts over&#13;
         6,000 residents. Crucially, the IE sample only included households with&#13;
         at least one child less than two years old. These factors prevent the claims&#13;
         about the representativeness of sampled households.                                                       The IE sample was designed with&#13;

3.2 Comparison Between WSP Baseline Study&#13;
and Peru Population&#13;
In this subsection we compare some basic characteristics of the Peruvian popula-&#13;
tion against characteristics of the individuals included in the IE subsample. The&#13;
main reason behind this exercise was to confirm the external validity of the results&#13;
presented throughout the document. We concentrated on four groups of vari-&#13;
ables: demographics, educational attainment, occupation, and total household&#13;
income per capita. We used the Peru 2007 National Household Survey/Encuesta&#13;
Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO) data for the comparison (ENAHO 2007).8&#13;
&#13;
Table 1 presents the demographics for both subsamples. The population                                              The population included in the WSP&#13;
included in the WSP impact evaluation baseline survey comprises a much                                             impact evaluation baseline survey&#13;
younger population than the general population. On average, the individuals                                        comprises a much younger population&#13;
                                                                                                                   than the general population.&#13;
interviewed in the WSP survey were 18.4 years old, whereas the average age of&#13;
total population was 28.3 years. The primary reason for this difference is that&#13;
there were no childless households in the WSP sample. While the average num-&#13;
ber of children under the age of five per household was 0.43 in Peru, this figure&#13;
was 1.37 in the WSP sample.&#13;
&#13;
Regarding educational attainment, there appears to be no significant differences be-                               Regarding educational attainment,&#13;
tween the individuals included in the WSP survey and total population (Table 2).                                   there appears to be no significant&#13;
                                                                                                                   differences between the individuals&#13;
Although in this subsample there was a smaller proportion of individuals with no&#13;
                                                                                                                   included in the WSP survey and total&#13;
education, the proportion of those with trade, undergraduate, or graduate education                                population.&#13;
was also smaller compared to the total Peruvian population older than 14 years old.&#13;
&#13;
In what follows, we focus on the occupational differences between both subsam-&#13;
ples in order to assess the different possibilities of income generation. As we can&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;
    We excluded the Metropolitan Area of Lima from the ENAHO. The population considered in the ENAHO&#13;
    was selected following the restriction of age imposed by the WSP survey for each group of questions. Nominal&#13;
    income-related variables were adjusted by the inflation rate of 2008 obtained from the Instituto Nacional de&#13;
    Estadistica e Informatica (INEI).&#13;

We also find important differences concerning primary employment status. In the                                          The average salary of the dependent&#13;
WSP subsample there was a much larger proportion of self-employed workers                                                workers surveyed by the WSP survey&#13;
than in the total population, 54.4% and 37.8% respectively. Also, the WSP popu-                                          was 521.91 Peruvian nuevos soles&#13;
                                                                                                                         (S/.), while the average salary of those&#13;
lation had a smaller proportion of employers and workers with no remuneration,&#13;
                                                                                                                         surveyed in the ENAHO was S/. 680.40.&#13;
indicating a smaller household income per capita in the WSP sample.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, we present two measures of income: salaries received in the primary work&#13;
and total household income per capita.9 Figure 2 presents the distribution of&#13;
salaries divided into two groups: dependent and independent workers.&#13;
&#13;
The average salary of the dependent workers surveyed by the WSP survey was&#13;
521.91 Peruvian nuevos soles (S/.), while the average salary of those surveyed in&#13;
the ENAHO was S/. 680.40. Moreover, the maximum salary earned by depen-&#13;
dent workers in the WSP survey was almost S/. 1,000 less than the one earned by&#13;
total dependent workers in Peru. The same difference applies to the subsample of&#13;
independent workers included in the WSP survey, whose average income was&#13;
S/. 332.70, while that of the total independent workers of Peru was S/. 381.70.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
    In the ENAHO we considered the gross salary for the dependent workers. For the independent workers, we&#13;
    included the payments received in kind, since the ENAHO does not divide the independent worker's income into&#13;
    monetary and inkind income (the WSP survey does not include income perceived in kind). The ENAHO measure&#13;
    of total HH income per capita includes: dependent workers' salary, independent workers' income, other labor&#13;
    income, domestic and foreign transfers, income received from the rent of household assets, and other extraordinary&#13;
    income. For these three income measures we used the imputed, deflated, and annualized variables provided by the&#13;
    ENAHO, which were inflation-adjusted and divided by 12 in order to have monthly values.&#13;

     facilities, and a handwashing station.&#13;
                                               Table 4 presents summary statistics related to access to improved drinking-water source&#13;
                                               and improved sanitation facility,10 as well as access to an observed handwashing station&#13;
                                               with soap and water.11 On average, 47.8% of the surveyed households had access to&#13;
                                               improved sanitation. This figure rose to 54.4% for households located in a coastal area&#13;
                                               and declined to 32.5% for those located in the jungle. The number of households with&#13;
                                               access to improved water was higher; over 75.6% of the households had access to an&#13;
                                               improved water source. Again, this proportion was higher for those households located&#13;
                                               in a coastal area and lower for those in the jungle, 86.3% and 62% respectively. Finally,&#13;
                                               almost 65% of the households had a handwashing station with soap and water.&#13;
                                               Households in the jungle of Peru had the highest percentage of handwashing stations&#13;
                                               with soap and water.&#13;

                                               Map 112 presents a disaggregation of these variables by administrative department.&#13;
                                               The proportion of households having access to improved sanitation and improved&#13;
                                               water sources was clearly higher for the departments located near the Peruvian&#13;
                                               coast, as we have already mentioned. However, when using maps to show this&#13;
                                               information, we divide Peru into two large groups of departments with a very&#13;
                                               unequal percentage of households having improved sanitation and water source.&#13;

that less than half of the households had access to improved sanitation facilities, and&#13;
among the poorest households access to improved sanitation was as low as 31.6%.&#13;
On the coast, access to improved sanitation increased to 54.4%, but the percentage&#13;

of any type, and the figure increased to 30.4% for the poorest households. Most&#13;
of these facilities were located in the household yard (35.4%), inside the house-&#13;
hold (33.4%), or in a nearby location less than a 10-minute walk away (22.3%)&#13;
or in other locations more than a 10-minute walk away (7.3%).&#13;
&#13;
On average, more than 8% of the total toilet facilities were public and 28% of them&#13;
were shared. Poorer households had similar percentages of public and shared toilet facili-&#13;
ties than wealthier households (7.3% versus 8%, and 24.5% versus 26.5%). Regarding&#13;
the safety of female household members when using the toilet facility during the night,&#13;
only 74.7% of them declared being safe. This figure was lower for poorest households&#13;
and higher for the richest ones (65.9% versus 82.8%, respectively).&#13;

4.4 Handwashing Behavior&#13;
The handwashing project seeks to achieve health and welfare impacts by promot-&#13;
ing handwashing with soap; therefore measuring handwashing behavior at critical&#13;
junctures is crucial. The survey includes several modules aiming to measure hand-&#13;
washing behavior. The questions include self-reported handwashing behavior&#13;
with soap at critical moments, observations of handwashing station(s) stocked&#13;
with soap and water (as well as its location), observations of mother's hands, and&#13;
structured observations of handwashing behavior.                                              Less than half of the caregivers&#13;
                                                                                              reported handwashing with soap at&#13;
                                                                                              times of fecal contact. . . . Regarding&#13;

disaggregated by critical juncture. Almost all caregivers (99.6%) confirmed having            soap with cooking or preparing food&#13;
washed their hands with soap at least once since yesterday, but handwashing with              and 34.1% with feeding their children.&#13;

     the caregivers reported handwashing with soap at times of                        area. The number of households with an observed hand-&#13;
     fecal contact (46% of caregivers associated handwashing with                     washing station with soap and water was much higher among&#13;
     use of toilet and 41.7% with cleaning children's bottoms).                       the wealthiest households (72.5%) than among the poorest&#13;
     Regarding food handling, 68.3% of caregivers associated&#13;
     having washed hands with soap with cooking or preparing&#13;
     food and 34.1% with feeding their children. Handwashing&#13;
     with soap increased with income at every juncture. Table 22B&#13;
     shows the same figures disaggregated by geographical area.&#13;
     Caregivers living in the jungle had the lowest rates of hand-&#13;
     washing with soap for all critical junctures. For instance, only&#13;
     20.1% of caregivers in the jungle associated washing hands&#13;
     with soap with cleaning children's bottoms while that figure&#13;
     was 49.3% on the coast. Similarly, 36.2% of caregivers living&#13;
     in the jungle associated handwashing with soap with toilet&#13;
     use, compared to 50.1% on the coast.&#13;

yard more than 10 feet from either the kitchen or the toilet facility, while the&#13;
percentage is only 13.2% in the richest households. Table 23B also shows that&#13;
households living in the mountains had not only the lowest percentages of hand-&#13;
washing stations with soap and water overall, but the location of the handwash-&#13;
ing station also tended to be further from the kitchen or toilet facility. For&#13;
instance, only 22.7% of the households in the mountains had the handwashing&#13;
station inside the kitchen or toilet facility, compared to much higher percentages&#13;
of households along the coast and in the jungle (50% and 44% respectively).&#13;
&#13;
If a different handwashing station was used to wash hands when preparing food&#13;
or feeding a child than the one used after going to the toilet, both handwashing&#13;
stations were observed and information regarding their characteristics was&#13;
collected for all stations used. Thus, Table 24A summarizes characteristics of&#13;
the handwashing station used after going to the toilet. There were two types&#13;
of handwashing devices most commonly used, a basin or bucket (49.2%) and a&#13;
tap or faucet (48.1%). In 86.8% of households, water was observed at the&#13;

the coast (9.8%). When analyzing the most common means of communication                     than those living on the coast (9.8%).&#13;
we observe that caregivers living on the coast were more familiar with TV, while&#13;
those living in the jungle and in the mountains relied more on radio communica-&#13;
tion. Finally, 16% of caregivers living in the jungle were not familiar with any&#13;
kind of media.&#13;
&#13;
As previously mentioned, no causal relationships can be inferred from these cross&#13;
tabulations. Still, in order to search for any relevant correlation, it is interesting to&#13;
compare the handwashing habits of caregivers who recalled any handwashing cam-&#13;
paign to the habits of those who did not recall any campaign. Table 26C presents&#13;

the results. As almost all caregivers reported washing their hands with soap since&#13;
yesterday, the results did not vary by income group. But when asked about&#13;
every specific situation in which they washed their hands, a higher proportion&#13;
of caregivers who recalled any handwashing campaign had washed their hands&#13;
more frequently. However, this higher figure could be due to the fact that those&#13;
households who recalled handwashing campaigns were aware of the social de-&#13;
sirability of washing hands at particular critical times.&#13;
&#13;
4.6 Family-School Relationship&#13;
In this subsection we present information about the family-school relationship,&#13;
since schools could be sources of sanitary-related diseases and of sanitary-related&#13;
information and education.&#13;
&#13;
Table 27 shows that a very high proportion of caregivers participated in school&#13;
activities (91.2%) and that 29.4% of them recalled some health and hygiene-&#13;
related campaigns. A higher number of caregivers coming from households with&#13;
a handwashing station with soap and water recalled a campaign promoted at the&#13;
school. The most frequent campaign topics were personal hygiene (30.5%), oral&#13;
hygiene (27.1%) and handwashing (20.4%). Also, a high percentage of caregivers&#13;
(70.2%) admitted having contributed with the campaign by donating their time&#13;
(32.7%), products (21.9%), or money (13.1%).&#13;
When looking at the disaggregation by geographical&#13;
area, we see that caregivers coming from the jungle&#13;
or the mountains of Peru tended to collaborate more&#13;
with the school in order to promote a better personal&#13;
hygiene, not only by participating more in school&#13;
activities but also by contributing more in school-&#13;
organized health campaigns.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, caregivers had directly contributed&#13;
to hygiene in the school environment as almost&#13;
75% of them sent soap to the school. Results are&#13;
reported on Table 28A and 28B. As expected, this&#13;
figure was slightly higher for those caregivers com-&#13;
ing from households with soap and water at their                         School pupils in Lambayeque use handwashing dispenser distributed&#13;

ter; this may be due to the fact that many centers only served children three to five&#13;
years of age. While the majority of children played with an adult (83.9%) or were&#13;
taken on an outing outside the home (91.8%) in the past three days, only about&#13;
one-quarter of caregivers read books or told stories to the child in the past three&#13;
days. The results reported in Table 33 reinforce previous findings that showed&#13;
more time and effort dedication by the caregivers coming from households with&#13;
higher incomes.&#13;

Figure 4 shows the histograms for the three variables' z-scores. All of them had a&#13;
mean value equal to 0. The median values for the communication skills-for-age&#13;
z-score, the gross motor skills-for-age z-score, and the personal-social skills-for-&#13;
age z-score were ­0.06, 0.09, and 0.19, respectively.&#13;

     A z-score, or standard score, indicates how many standard deviations an observation is below or above the average&#13;
     (mean). As the mean is normalized to zero, any negative z-scores would be below the mean, and any positive&#13;
     z-scores would be above the mean.&#13;

was a high and unexpected parasite presence in households located in the 3rd&#13;
quartile of the income distribution. However, the prevalence of the different&#13;
kinds of parasites was not homogeneous across income levels (poorest households&#13;
display higher presence of Ascaris and Blastocystis, while those located in the 3rd&#13;
quartile have a higher presence of Giardia). If the figures are disaggregated by&#13;
geographical location, we observe the prevalence of parasites was twice as high in&#13;
the mountains (22%) than in the jungle (11%) or the coast (9%). This is consis-&#13;
tent with previous findings, as households in the mountains had the lowest access&#13;
to improved water sources, improved sanitation, and a handwashing station with&#13;
soap and water.&#13;

            Peru - Global Scaling Up Handwashing
            Project : scaling up handwashing behavior - findings from
            the impact evaluation baseline survey
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In response to the preventable threats
            posed by poor sanitation and hygiene, the Water and
            Sanitation Program (WSP) launched two large-scale projects,
            global scaling up handwashing and global scaling up rural
            sanitation, to improve the health and welfare outcomes for
            millions of poor people. Local and national governments are
            implementing these projects with technical support from WSP.
            Global scaling up handwashing aims to test whether
            handwashing with soap behavior can be generated and
            sustained among the poor and vulnerable using innovative
            promotional approaches. The primary objectives are to reduce
            the risk of diarrhea in young children and increase
            household productivity by stimulating and sustaining the
            behavior of handwashing with soap at critical times.
            Overall, the project aims to generate and sustain
            handwashing with soap practices among 5.4 million people
            living in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam, the four
            countries where the project has been implemented to date.
            This technical paper presents the findings of the WSP impact
            evaluation (IE) baseline survey in Peru and is one in a
            series of papers presenting IE findings from surveys
            conducted in each project country.
