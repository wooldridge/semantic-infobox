PARADIGMS IN THE STUDY OF URBAN LABOR MARKETS IN LDCs:&#13;
A REASSESSMENT IN THE LIGHT OF AN EMPIRICAL SURVEY IN BOMBAY CITY&#13;
The paper analyzes the differences in the monthly earnings of&#13;
workers in three sub-sectors of the Bombay labor market. A hypo-&#13;
thesis is developed to explain the very large net intersectoral&#13;
differences observed in the proportions of temporary migrants,&#13;
and in the supply prices of temporary and permanent migrants.&#13;
The evidence presented on labor turnover and migration is consis-&#13;
tent with the hypothesis. It suggests a view of the process of&#13;
migration and urban wage determination that is different from the&#13;
current Harris-Todaro paradigm.&#13;
The study was financed by the Research Committee of the&#13;
World Bank (RPO 670-245).&#13;

Chapter I: THE CURRENT PARADIGM AND ITS&#13;
ALTERNATIVES   1/&#13;
In the study of the economic development of LDCs the&#13;
analysis of the expansion of urban employment and the attendant&#13;
process of internal migration is of central importance. Economic&#13;
analysis and policy in the fifties were dominated by the paradigms&#13;
proposed by Ragnar Nurkse and W. Arthur Lewis which draw largely&#13;
rosy conclusions from the possibility of an "unlimited' supply of&#13;
labor from the rural to the urban areas at a more or less constant&#13;
real wage. Surplus labor in traditional agriculture in "disguised&#13;
unemployment" was expected to create favorable conditions for the&#13;
rapid accumulation of capital through the reinvestment of profits&#13;
in the modern sector of LDCs, if only the state or the "capitalists'&#13;
took advantage of this source of concealed savings. No prior act&#13;
of savings was necessary through a lowering of real wages, as the&#13;
enclosures might conceivably have brought about during the industrial&#13;
revolution in Britain.Z/The discussions of the 1950s did not pay&#13;
particular attention to problems which might develop in the urban&#13;
labor market. The rural-urban wage gap was not expected to be&#13;
large (Lewis talked of   30% higher real wages in the urban areas&#13;
as normal), and unemployment or underemployment in the urbaai areas&#13;
could not be substantial: migrants who in the urban areas could&#13;
not secure an income at least as much as they enjoyed in the rural&#13;
areas by sharing in the family pot would return to the farms even&#13;
if their marginal contribution to the rural family income was very.&#13;
small.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
In the late sixties the paradigm of the urban labor market&#13;
began to change as observers became conscious of high rates of open&#13;
unemployment in many urban labor markets and urban poverty showed&#13;
itself no less oppressive than rural poverty. In the works of&#13;
Frank (68), Todaro (69) and Harris and Todaro (70), 1/ the idea&#13;
that rural-urban migration just meets the urban demand for labor&#13;
was superseded by the concept that migration is excessive. There&#13;
are three distinct elements in this new paradigm:&#13;
- There is a large wage gap, maintained by institutional&#13;
factors, between the rural sector and that part of the&#13;
urban labor market which is dominated by factories or&#13;
by public employment (variously termed the "formal",&#13;
the "organized", or the "ILO sector").&#13;
- People migrate in response to expected income, rather&#13;
than the income they are actually likely to earn, so&#13;
that they are prepared to accept a period of unemploy-&#13;
ment in the hope of getting a high wage job.&#13;
Outside the "formal" sector, urban wages subject to&#13;
competitive market forces can go down to significantly&#13;
lower levels, and indeed are pushed down below the&#13;
supply price of migrants as they crowd in to queue&#13;
for formal sector jobs. Such urban underemployment&#13;
exists side by side with open unemployment.&#13;
I have called this view of migration and the urban labor&#13;
market a paradigm because although the ideas have been summarized&#13;
in simple mathematical models, and sometimes the models have pro-&#13;
duced some predictions about the urban labor market that are not&#13;
intuitively obvious, 2/ they have not yet been tested empirically&#13;
1/  References are liited at the end of the naDer.&#13;
2/ Some examples are the following. Urban job creation may actually&#13;
lead to a higher unemployment rate, cf. Todaro (76), revised by&#13;
Blomqvist (78). Increases in employment and wages in the formal&#13;
sector may lead to a decline in average earnings over time in the&#13;
informal sector - Mazumdar (74). For the way induced migration&#13;
affects the shadow wage rate in project evaluation, see Harris&#13;
and Todaro, Mazumdar (76), Selowsky (78).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in any convincing way, and indeed it is likely that the formulations&#13;
so far devised are too simple to be tested. 1/ Todaro, in his recent&#13;
survey of the empirical testing of this group of ideas 2/ was able&#13;
to point only to studies of "macro" migration functions, rather than&#13;
studies of individual migrants' behavior, as lending support to the&#13;
idea that migrants respond to expected rather than actual income&#13;
differentials. Such functions only demonstrate that the rate of&#13;
migration from a particular area of origin is sensitive not only&#13;
to the wage level, but also to employment conditions, in the des-&#13;
tination point 3/--relationships that are intuitively obvious and&#13;
have been well documented in the inter-regional migration functions&#13;
of various countries. 4/ Such observations of behavior in the&#13;
aggregate do little to explain the decision of the individual&#13;
migrant to accept unemployment, or an economic loss in a job&#13;
paying less than he could earn at home, with the hope of ultimately&#13;
breaking into the high wage sector. We shall return to this point&#13;
later in this paper, but suffice it to say here that the length of&#13;
time for which an individual migrant is prepared to accept such loss&#13;
is a crucial variable, to be examined both theoretically and empiri-&#13;
cally if the idea behind the Harris-Todaro type of migration function&#13;
is to be properly tested.&#13;
1/ Little attempt seems to have been made in most formulations to go&#13;
beyond highly simplified viewaof the factors influencing migrants'&#13;
decisions, and particularly their expectations about urban employ-&#13;
ment.&#13;
2/ Todaro (76), pp. 67-74.&#13;

time interval as a proportion of the number unemployed.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
Before one comes to the migration function, and the urban&#13;
unemployment and/or underemployment it might generate, the initial&#13;
postulate that wages in the urban formal sector are artificially&#13;
high   must be studied carefully.   It is not enough to observe the&#13;
apparent difference between the going unskilled wage in the factory&#13;
or public sector and the wages prevalent in urban domestic service&#13;
or in agriculture. One serious deficiency of both the Lewis and&#13;
the Harris-Todaro paradigms is that they treat labor supplied to&#13;
the urban market as of homogeneous quality. Yet peasant workers&#13;
attracted to cities are likely to differ widely with respect to a&#13;
whole list of variables--for example whether or not they have&#13;
families to support in the city, how long they intend to stay&#13;
in the city, or in a given type of work, their responsiveness&#13;
to urban work, and many others. The differential in wages one&#13;
observes between the urban formal and      informal sectors may&#13;
in fact reflect differences in labor quality rather than the&#13;
effect of institutions. In analyzing these wage differences&#13;
it is possible, with moderate success, to allow for differences&#13;
in standard human capital variables like education or experience.&#13;
Such variables have been shown to have a considerable influence&#13;
on wage rates. in LDCs, and perhaps a greater influence than in the&#13;
industrial economies. Other indicators of labor quality, even when&#13;
measurable, are less easily tractable in earnings function types of&#13;
analysis, but may be extremely important. We shall discuss this&#13;
point more concretely later in the paper.&#13;
Empirically it is difficult to quantify wage differences&#13;
between sectors, if any, for labor of equivalent quality. But when&#13;
the apparent differential is large, and institutional factors in&#13;
wage determination seem to be strong, care should be taken to see&#13;
if differences in labor quality (other than the education-experience&#13;
variables which are commonly controlled for) are not responsible for&#13;
a substantial part of the wage difference.          Though wages&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
in the formal sector may appear to be determined by institutions,&#13;
employers can always, to some extent, adjust the quality of labor&#13;
they employ in order to minimize labor costs if wages are altered&#13;
substantially by institutional forces. 1/ Indeed, institutional&#13;
factors may often do no more than hasten changes in labor quality&#13;
standards that employers are already introducing.&#13;
One of the most important distinguishing features among&#13;
rural-urban migrants in LDCs is the type of migration. 2/ In&#13;
particular, a distinction has to be made between individual migrants,&#13;
who live in the urban areas without their families, and migrants who&#13;
bring up a family in town. Note that the distinction is not between&#13;
migrants who migrate with or without their families, but between&#13;
migrants with different family compositions in the urban area during&#13;
their urban residence. In many LDCs a large proportion of male&#13;
migrants live on their own, or with similar migrants in all-male&#13;
households. Such households exist side by side with families.&#13;
1/ Upgrading and downgrading jobs in response to changes in labor&#13;
market conditions, rather than altering the pay associated with&#13;
the job, has been recognized as a widely practiced method of&#13;
market adjustment, cf. Reder (55). The increase in labor pro-&#13;
ductivity in response to minimum wage legislation, without a&#13;
change in production techniques, is dramatically documented&#13;
in a study of Puerto Rico by Gregory and Reynolds (65).&#13;
2/ The differences between migrant types with respect to the&#13;
permanence of their attachment to the urban labor market have&#13;
been stressed for a long time in African labor history. One of&#13;
the mainsprings of the effort to increase wages in the formal&#13;
sector of Africa through minimum wage legislation has been the&#13;
desire to stabilize migrating labor which was said to have been&#13;
a drag on African productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The importance of this distinction between the two types&#13;
of migrants is that they differ in their supply prices as well as&#13;
in their desirability for urban employers.   The difference in supply&#13;
prices means that migrants with families are willing to accept&#13;
employment only at a higher urban wage than individual migrants.&#13;
The major reasons for the difference in supply prices of the two&#13;
types of migrants are: (a) the substantially higher housing costs&#13;
for the family migrant in town; (b) the lower earning strength of&#13;
the family in town, because women and children are less easily&#13;
part of the urban labor force than they are of the rural; and&#13;
(c) the existence of disguised unemployment on family farms,which&#13;
could make the marginal contribution of an individual worker low&#13;
relative to the average income per earner of the family. /&#13;
The reason for the higher demand price of family migrants&#13;
is that they are settled in the urban environment, and likely to&#13;
be more stable; the relationship between stability and productivity&#13;
of labor is well documented in the literature. 2/ Certain types of&#13;
employers will pay the higher wage that will attract family migrants,&#13;
because the higher productivity of such workers will more than offset&#13;
their higher-wage cost.. 3/&#13;

felling trees and clearing bushes,needed about every two years,&#13;
could be absent for two years at a time with6ut affectin5 the&#13;
productivity of the family farm.&#13;
2/  The economic cost of non-stable labor has been widely studied for&#13;
African urban labor, based as it was on the migrant labor system.&#13;
An early and careful study of a Natal Dunlop Factory came to the&#13;
conclusion that, because of the migratory tendencies of native&#13;
workers, their productivity came to only 29% of that of European&#13;
workers, while the potential productivity of a stable native worker&#13;
was as high as 81% of the European worker's--University of Natal(50),&#13;
Chapter V.&#13;
3/  It is necessary fr this argument only that the bulk of stable labor&#13;
be supplied by family migrants. Some individual migrants may indeed&#13;
be stable without affecting the reasoning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The relationship between stability and productivity need&#13;
not be equally strong in all sectors of the urban labor market.&#13;
In the formal factory sector we could expect employers to profit&#13;
considerably from the existence of a stable labor force. But in&#13;
many parts of the informal sector--in small shops or eating houses&#13;
for example--productivity increase with stability of labor is&#13;
likely to be minimal. Under competitive conditions, then, we would&#13;
expect wage differentials to emerge in the urban labor market&#13;
with the higher wage sectors attracting more stable family migrants.&#13;
A.  A Revised Hypothesis&#13;
I would thus like to suggest a revision of the current&#13;
paradigm of the urban labor market stemming from the Harris-Todaro&#13;
work, on each of the three points noted earlier:&#13;
- A wage gap exists between the formal urban sector and&#13;
the rural areas,with formal urban sector wages reflecting&#13;
the cost of employing migrant workers accompanied by their&#13;
families, who, like native urban workers, are more stable&#13;
and hence more productive than other migrants. Institutional&#13;
factors affecting wages may push up wages beyond this level,&#13;
but not necessarily so, and certainly not by as much as a&#13;
cursory glance at earnings data for individual workers&#13;
would suggest.&#13;
- There are,different types of migrants attracted from the&#13;
rural to the urban areas, and the analysis of equilibrium&#13;
in the urban labor market will be incomplete if we leave&#13;
out of account the different supply prices of these dif-&#13;
ferent types. In particular, the supply price of indivi-&#13;
dual migrants will be substantially lower than that of&#13;
family migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
- The difference in wages between the formal and other&#13;
sectors of the urban labor market will be related to&#13;
the difference in supply prices of family and individual&#13;
migrants. The high-wage formal sector will have a work-&#13;
force which contains a larger proportion of family&#13;
migrants, who tend to be more permanent, than the non-&#13;
formal sectors in which the lower wages will attract&#13;
predominantly individual migrants of lesser stabilityo&#13;
The revised hypothesis provides an explanation of wage&#13;
differentials--between the rural and urban markets and between&#13;
different sectors of the urban market. It does not--as the Harris-&#13;
Todaro paradigm purports to do--contain any prediction of excessive&#13;
migration or urban unemployment. But then we have yet to see empi-&#13;
rical work which demonstrates that urban unemployment rates are&#13;
extremely high except for particular groups--mainly educated labor--&#13;
for which specific analysis and diagnosis are called for, i/&#13;
I have used the framework of this hypothesis, with its stress&#13;
on different migrant types, as the basis for the analysis of wage&#13;
determination in the textile industry of Bombay I/ before the Second&#13;
World War. My attempt was to provide explanations both for the rural-&#13;
urban wage gap and for earnings differentials between casuals and per-&#13;
manents employed in the industry. Thus the hypothesis is not so much&#13;
a new proposal as an attempt to introduce into the analysis of urban&#13;
labor markets in LDCs earlier ideas which had been inexplicably neg-&#13;
lected in the current literature.&#13;
I was fortunate in obtaining the collaboration of Bombay&#13;
University in undertaking a special survey of the Bombay labor&#13;
market in the years 1972-74. The Survey answered the need to&#13;
obtain information on different parts of the labor market--the&#13;
formal as well as the informal--on a range of common topics.&#13;
1/ See, for example, Mark Blaug and Richard Layard, Grad'uate&#13;
Unemployment in India  London, 1970, and my own forEEcoming&#13;
work on the problem of urban unemployment in Malaysia.&#13;
2/  See Mazumdar (59) for an early theoretical suggestion and&#13;
Mazumdar (73).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
The Survey sample is described in Section II, after a brief review&#13;
of the broad structure of the Bombay labor market.&#13;
In Section III we begin the analysis of the material&#13;
obtained from the Survey on the differences in earnings between&#13;
sectors. Section IV sets out the profile of the workforce in each&#13;
sector to highlight its composition, distinguishing migrants in&#13;
terms of their duration of residence in the city and their period&#13;
of work in their current job. Section V analyzes impermanence of&#13;
migration in the different sectors in terms of the material presented&#13;
in the previous sections, the question of waiting before the first&#13;
job, and job changes in the urban labor market. It then proceeds&#13;
to discuss family size in Bombay. The latter is a crucial variable&#13;
in the argument linking the degree of permanence of migration on the&#13;
one hand, and the supply price of migrants on the other. We conclude&#13;
with a recapitulation of the main results.&#13;
We should be careful to note that throughout the analysis&#13;
all the results refer to male wage earners only.   Female workers&#13;
are in a small minority in the Bombay labor market. Our survey did&#13;
collect information on females, but an analysis of this important&#13;
topic is outside the scope of this paper.&#13;

Chapter II: THE BOMBAY LABOR MARKET AND A DESCRIPTION&#13;
OF THE SURVEY SAMPLE&#13;
A. Structure of the Bombay Labor Market&#13;
Heather and Vijay Joshi 1/ have given a breakdwon of the&#13;
city's labor force between the organized and the unorganized sectors,&#13;
classified by industry and the worker type, for the year 1961. They&#13;
used the employment data collected by the Directorate of Employment&#13;
and Training (which covered all public sector establishments and&#13;
privately owned establishments employing 25 or more workers) to map&#13;
out the limits of the "organized" sector. The difference between&#13;
this set of figures and the Census returns for the same year gave&#13;
the structure of employment in the "unorganized" sector. The Joshis&#13;
note that this classification more or less identifies the organized&#13;
sector with workers who are effectively covered by labor legislation,&#13;
although theoretically the Factory Act extends beyond this limit to&#13;
workers in establishments with no less than 10 employees, if they&#13;
use electric power in their operations.&#13;
Table 1 gives 'a breakdown of the employment structure in&#13;
1961 by broad categories as calculated by the Joshis. The unorganized&#13;
sector, which provided about half of the employment in the city,&#13;
accounted for a disproportionately large share of trade, commerce&#13;
and services, although it is interesting to note that the&#13;

manufacturing unorganized sector was also quite large. A&#13;
little less than half of the workers in the unorganized&#13;
sector were non-employees. These were single workers, family&#13;
workers and workers in household industry. The category of&#13;
single workers should be explained. The Bombay labor market,&#13;
then as now, makes use of a large number of workers employed&#13;
on a daily contract, as and when work becomes available, much&#13;
like dock labor in industrial countries. These workers are&#13;
not attached to any particular enterprise but they do show a&#13;
significant amount of occupational and industrial specialization.&#13;
There are well known areas in the city, almost like market&#13;
places, where such workers assemble each day and are hired&#13;
on a casual day-to-day basis. Such casual labor is a substan-&#13;
tial part of the non-employee labor force of the unorganized&#13;
sector; the figure given for 1961 in the table probably under-&#13;
estimates the share of the unorganized sector in the total&#13;
employment in Bombay at that time. This is likely because&#13;
casual laborers working in the manufacturing sector would have&#13;
been included in the returns on total employment obtained by&#13;
the Directorate of Industry from the individual enterprises.&#13;
In the textile industry such labor at this date could have&#13;
accounted for as much as 20-25% of the work force.&#13;
B. Changes in the Composition of Employment,&#13;
1961-1971&#13;
Our survey of the labor market was undertaken in&#13;
1973-74. Joshi and Joshi have provided estimates of the growth&#13;
of employment by sector for the intercensal decade 1961-1971.&#13;
Their figures are given in Table 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Souree: Joshi and Joshi, op.cit., Table III.3, pp. 58-59.&#13;
It should be noted that the Census of 1971 used a&#13;
different, and in effect more conservative, definition of&#13;
workers from that used in 1961. Thus, using the 1961 definition,&#13;
the Census figure for workers for 1971 is an underestimate;&#13;
Joshi and Joshi suggest of the order of 4 percent. The "organized"&#13;
sector figures given in Table 2 were obtained from the returns of&#13;
the Directorate of Industry and are not affected by this change in&#13;
definition.   Thus, allowing for the change in census definitions,&#13;
the growth of organized sector employment in Bombay lagged&#13;
behind that of total employment by perhaps 1 percent per annum;&#13;
the lag was greater for the manufacturing sector of Greater&#13;
Bombay. However, Table 2 also shows that if we include the&#13;
expansion of employment in the satellite towns of Thana urban&#13;
districts the lag in the organized sector growth rate is&#13;
substantially less.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Another aspect of the organized sector employment&#13;
growth needs to be noted. It is the major change in the&#13;
industrial composition of employment in Bombay City during&#13;
the decade. Employment in cotton mills, which accounted for&#13;
almost one-half of total manufacturing employment in the&#13;
organized sector of the city in 1961, remained virtually&#13;
stagnant throughout the decade. The increase in employment&#13;
in organized industry came largely from very high rates of&#13;
growth in newer industries--particularly the more skill-&#13;
intensive industries like petro-chemicals, pharmaceuticals&#13;
and electronics.&#13;
C. The Survey 'Samp'le&#13;
It was decided to cover three sectors of the market:&#13;
(a) the single workers and the casuals as we have described them&#13;
above; (b) the workers in the small-scale sector; and (c) the&#13;
-workers in factories. We also decided to exclude from the&#13;
sample owner/workers and family workers who constitute an&#13;
important proportion of the city's "informal" sector of workers.&#13;
The study was deliberately limited to wage earners.&#13;
The sample framework was provided by lists of esta-&#13;
blishments in the city--for factories, the list maintained by&#13;
the Chief Inspector of-Factories, and for small establishments,&#13;
the registers maintained by the Municipal Ward Offices. The&#13;
sample size of workers to be interviewed was predetermined&#13;
for each of the three sectors of the labor market, and the&#13;
total for each sector was distributed among establishments&#13;
belonging to different industrial groups, so as to ensure&#13;
that for each sector of the market the sample of establishments&#13;
reflected the industrial distribution of the wage earners. For&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
each of the factories.selected, the quota of workers to be&#13;
interviewed was selected at random from the employee rolls,&#13;
while for the small-scale sector, whose average employment&#13;
was 2.9 workers per establishment, all the wage earners in&#13;
each of the sample establishments were surveyed. The size&#13;
of the sample was about 2,700 workers in factories and&#13;
2,000 workers in small-scale units.&#13;
The casual workers are not attached to any esta-&#13;
blishments. Thus we do not have a sample frame for an&#13;
establishment-based survey. It was decided to survey 1,100&#13;
casual workers randomly selected from those who gathered&#13;
for work in the well-known market places for casual workers,&#13;
but taking care to ensure that the industrial composition of&#13;
the sample reflected the industrial distribution of the&#13;
population of single workers in the city, as derived from&#13;
census data.&#13;
D.  The Labor Market Problem in Bombay City:&#13;
Open Unemployment vs. Low Income&#13;
The survey emphasized the differences in earnings&#13;
between sectors, and inter alia, the causes of low incomes.&#13;
Those totally unemployed at the date of the survey were not&#13;
included. The casual workers by definition were not employed&#13;
on a regular basis, and would be unemployed some days of the&#13;
month, but the survey found only a small incidence of unemploy-&#13;
ment among them. The average number of days worked per month&#13;
by the sample of male casual workers was 23, giving an overall&#13;
rate of underemployment of about 10 percent (assuming 26 days&#13;
to be full employment for most workers).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
An aspect of unemployment captured for the entire&#13;
sample was the period that migrants waited for their first job&#13;
in the city. Migrants were asked whether they had a fixed job&#13;
or firm offer of a job before they came. At another point they&#13;
were asked about the length of unemployment before their first&#13;
job in Bombayl at still anothe about who supported them during&#13;
their period of waiting. The results for the sample are&#13;
reported in Table 3 by sector.&#13;
Table 3: PERCENTAGES OF MIGRANTS WITH LITTLE WAITING&#13;

Casual                 13.8            20.0           Not available&#13;
It is interesting to see how the proportion of migrants&#13;
who said they had no long wait increased as the questions were&#13;
phrased more loosely. In both the factory and small-scale&#13;
sectors, it appears nearly half the sample of migrants more or&#13;
less sailed into their first urban job. Waiting was clearly&#13;
more common among casual workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The distribution of migrants sampled by their&#13;
reported period of actual unemployment before the first job&#13;
is given in Table 4.&#13;

It is clear that those who were unemployed for a&#13;
reasonably long period, say more than 3 months, 1/ were in a&#13;
minority. It is also interesting to note that this proportion&#13;
was higher in the factory sector than in the other sectors--&#13;
which is consistent with the model of queueing up for high wage&#13;
jobs. In the absence of a model specified in detail it is&#13;
difficult to assess the prevalence of long periods of unemploy-&#13;
ment. Intuitively, a mere 15% of the sample waiting more than&#13;
6 months does not appear to be an excessive proportion in a&#13;
normally functioning labor market,without a preponderance of&#13;
Harris-Todaro gamblers.&#13;
None of the migrants financed themselves,from savings&#13;
or borrowings, while unemployed. Of those who needed help, 50%&#13;
said they received support from their family members--and rather&#13;
more did so in the factory sector, perhaps in      reflection of&#13;
the higher income of the relatives who helped them. Even the&#13;
1/ We checked to see if these figures were affected by excluding&#13;
from the sample those who had arrived in the city as children.&#13;
They were not.&#13;

two other types of helpers who were mentioned in significant&#13;
numbers in the response of the workers to the questionnaire--&#13;
viz. "caste fellows" and "native persons" (from the same area&#13;
of origin)-typically did not accept any payment for their support.&#13;
We conclude that there is little evidence of the type&#13;
of "investment in unemployment" for the fresh migrant to the&#13;
urban market which has been stressed in the Harris-Todaro paradigm.&#13;
Since much of urban unemployment in their view is ascribed to&#13;
this phenomenon, it would appear that this particular problem&#13;
is not important in the Bombay labor market. On the other hand,&#13;
as we shall see0 the differences in earnings in different parts&#13;
of the market are significant.&#13;

Chapter III: EARNINGS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN&#13;
SECTORS&#13;
We begin our exploration of the working of the&#13;
Bombay labor market and the characteristics of the three major&#13;
sectors distinguished by analyzing intersectoral differences&#13;
in earnings.&#13;
The distribution of earnings of male workers by&#13;
broad monthly earnings groups for each sector is given in&#13;
Table 5.&#13;

- 20 -&#13;
The earnings differentials between the three sectors&#13;
are very large--whether we use the mean, the median or the mode.&#13;
Factory workers earn 75% more than those in the small-scale&#13;
sector, and two and a half times as much as those in casual&#13;
work. Of course, a significant part of the earnings differences&#13;
will reflect differences in workers' characteristics, including&#13;
the standard human capital factors. Our task in this section is&#13;
to assess the extent of the differential after we have controlled&#13;
for the effects of these variables. This preliminary sorting&#13;
should also show whether certain types of workers--e.g., of a&#13;
particular educational range--are concentrated in particular&#13;
sectors. At this stage the degree of permanence of migration&#13;
is left out of account.&#13;
Stepwise multiple regression models were run with&#13;
earnings as the dependent variable for each sector separately.&#13;
The explanatory variables used could be giouped as follows:&#13;
- Standard human capital variables--age; education;&#13;
occupation; period of training; knowledge of English.&#13;
- Personal attributes of the worker--migrant or native;&#13;
marital status; whether the worker was a principal&#13;
or secondary earner.&#13;
- Background variables which are said to influence&#13;
earnings in a segmented labor market--caste;&#13;
religion; mother tongue; and parental occupation&#13;
and education.&#13;
The first group of factors was the most pervasive in&#13;
its influence. For casual workers education seemed to have&#13;
rather little influence on earnings, compared to the other&#13;
factors, but this partly reflects the limited variation of&#13;
educational levels among workers in this sector. Tables 6&#13;
and 7 give the percentage distribution of the sample by age&#13;
and education in each sector.&#13;

Though the age structures of the casual and small-&#13;
scale sectors are very similar, the working population in the&#13;
factory sector is substantially older. By contrast, in educational&#13;
attainment workers in the small-scale sector are very much like&#13;
those in the factories, but the casual workers have a distinctly&#13;
lower educational level--concentrated below grade 6, or primary&#13;
school graduation.&#13;

Looking at the group of factors called personal&#13;
attributes, workers who were married and those who were principal&#13;
earners tended to earn more than those who were not.      These&#13;
variables are to some extent interchangeable and they are cor-&#13;
related with age.&#13;
Stratification of the labor market by one or other of&#13;
the "background" variables is a common theme of popular commen-&#13;
tators, but one that our survey findings left largely unsubstantiated.&#13;
None of the three sectors was dominated by a particular caste. The&#13;
earnings of Shudra (low) caste workers were significantly low in&#13;
the casual sector, but were higher than average in the small-scale&#13;
sector, and not noticeably different from average in the factories.&#13;
Half of the casual workers came from landless workers' families,&#13;
as against 38% of the workers in the small-scale sector, and 28%&#13;
of those in the factories. The father's occupation bore no&#13;
obvious relation to earnings in any of the three sectors.&#13;
Father's education and mother's education had a weak influence on&#13;
earnings in some cases, but no systematic relationship was seen&#13;
to hold across sectors.&#13;
In the final analysis of earnings differences only&#13;
human capital variables were used. The results are set out in&#13;
Annex Table Al.&#13;
The major conclusion of the analysis is that workers'&#13;
earnings depend more upon their sector of work, whether casual,&#13;
small-scale enterprises, or factories, than on any of their&#13;
personal attributes: gross differences in earnings between&#13;
sectors are reduced to some extent, but persist, after the&#13;
other explanatory variables are introduced. (See the difference&#13;
between the deviations in columns (3) and (5). The main effect&#13;
of introducing these other variables is to bring the average&#13;
earnings in each sector closer to the average earnings of all&#13;
sectors combined: the disparity between the casual sector and&#13;
the combined average is reduced by one third, and that between&#13;
the larger factories and the combined average is reduced by 10%.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
The importance of the sector of work for the earnings differentials&#13;
is underlined by the fact that the spread in earnings between the&#13;
casuals and the workers in the largest factories, after controlling&#13;
for other factors, is greater than the spread between illiterates&#13;
and the most educated. (It should be remembered, however, that&#13;
it is only the wage earners we are looking at, and not executives&#13;
and white collar professionals). Workers in the largest factories&#13;
earn just over twice as much as casual workers, controlling for&#13;
other variables, while the gross difference is more than three&#13;
times as much.&#13;
&#13;

Chanter IV: DIFFERENCES IN THE INCIDENCE OF&#13;
TEMPORARY MIGRATION&#13;
Having established the existence of very large differences&#13;
in earning's between casual, small-scale sector, and factory workers,&#13;
our next task is to analyze the differences in the proportion of&#13;
temporary migrants in the three sectors, before assessing how&#13;
they correspond to differences in earnings.&#13;
Migration may be temporary in two senses. Migrants may&#13;
come to the city for some seasons of the year, but also take part&#13;
in economic activity in their rural areas of origin. No signifi-&#13;
cant number of the migrants sampled were "temporary" in this sense.&#13;
About a third of the entire sample had not visited their ancestral&#13;
homes at all during the last three years. Even the other two-&#13;
thirds only visited occasionally, for short periods. About half&#13;
of those who did visit their native place said their purpose was&#13;
to "visit relatives". Only 14% mentioned helping family farms&#13;
or businesses as reasons for visiting.&#13;
Migration may also be seen as temporary if migrants&#13;
decide to return to their place of origin after a few years.&#13;
Migrant workers who return need not be the classical    figures&#13;
portrayed in the economic literature of Africa who decide in&#13;
advance to work in towns only for a limited period,to earn a&#13;
fixed amount of cash. Their decision to remigrate may come&#13;
gradually during their urban careers, and thus it is not&#13;
possible to assess the importance of this phenomenon by&#13;
asking migrants in a sample survey their intentions about&#13;
urban residence. In fact, in the Bombay survey-4 out of 5&#13;
migrants'asked about their purpose in migration indicated&#13;
permanent employment as their reason. Education came next&#13;
in importance. Only in the casual sector did a perceptible&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
number--about 5% of the sample--explicitly indicate that they&#13;
came to the city for temporary employment; in the other sectors&#13;
migrants with this declared purpose were negligible. I/&#13;
Unfortunately, no accurate measures of return migration--&#13;
its rate and demographic composition--can be obtained from a one-&#13;
shot survey in an urban area. For such measures we need informa-&#13;
tion at two points of time on migrants' duration of residence,&#13;
by age groups, such as can be derived from census of population&#13;
data. However, some suggestive conclusions--particularly on&#13;
the differences between different sectors of the urban labor&#13;
marketw.imay be inferred from the profiles of migrants.&#13;
Table 8 gives the percentage distribution of the work-&#13;
force in each sector by duration of residence..&#13;

1/ Even in Kenya, where temporary migrants could be expected to&#13;
be more common, Rempel found that in his sample survey only&#13;
about 13% indicated their purpose of migration in a way that&#13;
classified them as "circulator migrants"; cf. H. Rempel (1971).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
The proportion of urban natives in the labor force&#13;
is roughly the same in all three sectors. But the non-factory&#13;
sector appears to be dominated by recent migrants and the&#13;
factory sector by long-term migrants: the proportion of&#13;
migrants who have been in the city more than 10 years is&#13;
larger in the small-scale than in the casual sector, and&#13;
much larger in the factory sector.&#13;
One point of clarification is called for regarding&#13;
the proportions of migrant types just noted. A migrant is&#13;
defined as someone who was born outside the city; hence, migrants&#13;
include those who came as children with their families, and were&#13;
really brought up in the city. 1/ If such "child migrants" were&#13;
disproportionately concentrated in the factory sector, our results&#13;
just quoted could be misleading. Table 9 shows, for each sector,&#13;
the proportion of migrants who came to the city as children, and&#13;
the proportion of recent migrants assessed with and without these&#13;
child migrants.&#13;

1/  In Indian cities mothers often return to their ancestral homes in the&#13;
villages at the time of childbirth. Thus the proportion of migrants&#13;
in the population is exaggerated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
It is seen that the larger proportions of recent migrants found&#13;
in non-factory sectors are not due to a disproportionate concen-&#13;
tration of child migrants in the factory sector. Workers who&#13;
migrated as children are indeed more likely to be longer-term&#13;
migrants no matter what the sector, so that when we confine our&#13;
attention to migrants who came to the city as adults, recent&#13;
migrants form a greater proportion of the total migrants in&#13;
every sector (see the last column of Table 9). Even so, the&#13;
intersectoral differences in the proportions of recent migrants&#13;
are, if anything, increased.&#13;
The' smaller proportion of recent migrants in the&#13;
factory sector may be caused by one or a combination of three&#13;
factors:&#13;
- slow growth in factory employment;&#13;
- a larger proportion of recruits to the factory&#13;
sector being natives or longer duration migrants;&#13;
and&#13;
- return migration among migrants employed in the&#13;
non-factory sectors.&#13;
As Table 2 suggested, in the last decade, employment&#13;
in factories grew a little more slowly than that in the rest of&#13;
the economy of Greater Bombay--a difference of about one percentage&#13;
point per annum. A/ A difference of this size is unlikely to&#13;
explain the much larger percentages of short-duration workers&#13;
in the casual and small-scale sectors. The6number of new jobs&#13;
coming up in each sector would also be affected by the'rate of&#13;
turnover--and this rate could be lower in factories. Table 10&#13;
gives the percentage distribution of workers in the different&#13;
sectors by the duration of their current job. It shows that&#13;
factory workers hold their jobs for much longer than those in&#13;
the other sectors.&#13;

A.  The Importance' of Return Migration&#13;
It is now necessary to investigate how far the short periods&#13;
for which workers in the small-scale and casual sectors hold their&#13;
jobs are due to job mobility within the urban market, and how far&#13;
they are due to return migration. In the casual sector, the'number&#13;
of jobs changed is a difficult concept because'the workers are not&#13;
attached to specific establishments: job mobility can only be&#13;
measured if workers change occupations or change sectors.     Our&#13;
survey, however, collected data on the number of job'changes from&#13;
the sample now employed in the small-scale and factory sectors.&#13;
Generally, the degree of mobility was surprisingly low'. In both&#13;
sectors about 40% of the migrants and 50% of the6natives reported&#13;
having no change of jobs at all in the urban market. Of course,&#13;
this proportion drops with increase in age, but even for the'age&#13;
group 35-44 the percentages of "non-movers" were'as follows:&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
These are very low figures. Migrants on the average might have&#13;
had one other job after being in Bombay about 5 years in the&#13;
small-scale sector, and 10 years in the factory sector.&#13;
These data on the low turnover rate of workers remaining&#13;
in the urban labor market, together with the evidence in Table 10&#13;
that in the small scale sector a large proportion of the sample&#13;
holds jobs only for short periods, suggest that there is a high&#13;
incidence of return migration in this sector.&#13;
We know from the work of demographers that return migration&#13;
is significant in Bombay City. Zachariah (68), using information&#13;
from the 1951 and 1961 censuses, found that during that decade&#13;
outmigration from Bombay was around 500,000 persons, of whom&#13;
three-quarters were returning migrants. Roughly half the influx&#13;
of population into Bombay during the decade was offset through&#13;
outmigration. As a percentage of the stock of migrant population&#13;
in 1961, the rate of outmigration was about 20%. Contrary to some&#13;
prevalent models, the peak rate of outmigration was not among the&#13;
older, post-retirement,age groups. The highest rate of outmigration&#13;
was observed in the 30-35 age group.&#13;
The 1971 census migration data have not yet been fully&#13;
analyzed, but preliminary calculations by Joshi and Joshi show&#13;
that r-et-Ft migration continued in the decade 1961-71. However,&#13;
along with xa reduced rate of migration, relative to natural increase,&#13;
the volume and rate of outmigration seem to have fallen. Outmigration&#13;
during 1961-71 probably offset one-third rather than one-half of gross&#13;
inmigration as in the previous decade.&#13;
This quantitative evidence of return migration for the&#13;
Bombay population as a whole provides only indirect evidence of&#13;
the return migration of migrants who have worked in the small-&#13;
scale sector. To cast some light on whether that sector has a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
higher than average incidence of return migration, Table 12&#13;
compares the distribution by duration of residence of the&#13;
migrant male population of Greater Bombay, obtained from the&#13;
Census of 1971, with that for the small-scale sector of our&#13;
sample.&#13;

Anotier possible reascn for the differexes wshain in Table 12 is&#13;
that migrants may spend their early years in Bombay working in&#13;
the casual or small-scale sectors and then move to organized&#13;
sector jobs.   As we document more firmly in the next section,&#13;
such movement is of limited significance. Thus, among migrants&#13;
of less than 10 years' residence in Bombay, return migration is&#13;
substantially more conmmon among migrants in the small-scale and&#13;
casual sectors than it is for all migrants as a group--and we have&#13;
already seen that the average incidence of return migration is high.&#13;
&#13;

B. Return Migration, "Graduation", and the Harris-&#13;
Todaro Paradigm&#13;
In the Harris-Todaro view of the migration process&#13;
migrants enter the urban labor market through the "informal"&#13;
sector, and if they fail to "graduate" to the formal sector&#13;
within a reasonable (unspecified) period of time many of them&#13;
would return to their rural areas of origin. Thus, the larger&#13;
proportion of recent migrants that we have observed in the small-&#13;
scale sector, and the greater importance of return migration that&#13;
we have inferred in this sector are predicted both by the Harris-&#13;
Todaro paradigm and the alternative hypothesis advanced at the&#13;
outset of this paper. The real distinguishing point of the two&#13;
models is the mechanism of wage determination in the formal sector,&#13;
In the Harris-Todaro view the elevated wage in the formal sector is&#13;
institutionally maintained; in the alternative hypothesis it&#13;
is determined by the higher supply price of more permanent&#13;
migrants. We shall turn to the question of what determines&#13;
the higher formal sector wage in the next section. But it might&#13;
be appropriate at this stage to draw attention to one aspect of&#13;
the empirical evidence on "graduation" provided by our sample&#13;
survey in Bombay City.&#13;
For the Harris-Todaro paradigm of the migration process,&#13;
it is movement out of the non-factory to the factory sector which&#13;
is relevant. Such movement will only be a fraction of the total&#13;
mobility discussed above. Evidence was collected in our survey&#13;
about migrants with regular jobs now (both in the small-scale and&#13;
factory sectors) who initially worked at casual jobs and sub-&#13;
sequently moved to regular employment. Movers of this type were&#13;
only 11% of the total number of migrants who had changed jobs at&#13;
least once. 1/&#13;
1/ The figure for those in the factory sector was higher--about 17%.&#13;
This partially reflects the usual system of recruitment of labor&#13;
in the textile industry, discussed in Mazumdar (1973), in which&#13;
a worker serves as an apprentice or as a substitute worker on a&#13;
day-to-day basis before getting a regular contract. The number&#13;
of workers in the textile industry affected by this system must&#13;
be much smaller now, as employment in textile factories has been&#13;
stagnant for some time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34 -&#13;
Unfortunately, our data set at the moment does not allow&#13;
us to quantify the movement from the small-scale to the factory&#13;
sector. But we have information on job changes within sectors,&#13;
and thus can look at the 57% of the sample of migrants in the factory&#13;
sector today who had changed jobs. Data on the industry of their&#13;
first jobs in the city show that 67% of these workers started in&#13;
manufacturing, where they are now. The other 33% came from dif-&#13;
ferent industries--particularly trade and services. The trade and&#13;
service establishments in which the migrant factory workers of today&#13;
had their first jobs are very likely to have been in the small-&#13;
scale sector. Thus,assuming that a fair proportion of those who&#13;
changed jobs within manufacturing also moved from small manufacturing&#13;
units to factories, perhaps as many as half of those who had changed&#13;
jobs in the factory sample had moved from the small-scale sector.&#13;
This makes the proportion of such movers about 25-30% of the&#13;
miQrant sample in factories.&#13;
Thus there is a fair support for the "graduation" hypo-&#13;
thesis for factory workers, but it is by no means the dominant&#13;
pattern of entry into the factory sector. It is also relevant&#13;
to ask how long the "graduation" takes for the fresh migrant, if&#13;
he does in fact graduate to the factory sector.&#13;
In simple formalizations of the Harris-Todaro paradigm&#13;
it is usual to express the new migrant's decision to come to the&#13;
urban market as being governed by his probability of getting a&#13;
formal sector job. But surely a very important influence on his&#13;
decision would be the length of time he would expect to be in the&#13;
informal or small-scale sector before his possible "graduation'.&#13;
Some light might be shed on this question by examining&#13;
the length of residence in the city of workers who have been&#13;
employed in their current job for less than 5 years. Table 13&#13;
shows the distribution of these workers by length of urban&#13;
residence, for the small-scale and the factory sectors.&#13;

Akmx the factory workers with recently acquired jobs a relatively&#13;
large number are natives of the city and migrants of longer dura-&#13;
tion. Further probing revealed that only a minority of these&#13;
longer duration migrants came to the city as children; the&#13;
majority had had a prior spell of work in Bombay City, pre-&#13;
sumably in the small-scale sector. Thus it appears from&#13;
Table 13, column 2 that, of the migrants recruited to the&#13;
factory sector in the last five years, nearly two-thirds had&#13;
been in the city more than 5 years before obtaining a factory job.&#13;
A point of some importance begins to emerge at this&#13;
stage. If conditions in Bombay City are typical of those in&#13;
urban labor markets, what kind of importance will a potential&#13;
migrant to the city attach to the probability of getting a&#13;
factory job, if he has no prior connection to the factory sector?&#13;
If the recent past is any guide, the number of factory jobs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
opening up in the next 5 years in Bombay City will be very&#13;
limited, and even for this small number, the new arrival would&#13;
have less than one-third the chance of getting a job of the&#13;
natives and the longer term migrants already in the market.&#13;
The small-scale sector has several times more jobs opening&#13;
up, and the possibility of a new migrant getting such a job&#13;
is substantially higher than that of other job seekers. It&#13;
would appear that unless the potential migrant's time horizon&#13;
is inordinately long, the economic gains from employment in&#13;
the small-scale sector must weigh much more heavily on his&#13;
decision-making than conditions in the factory sector, even&#13;
though the wages in the latter are so much higher.&#13;
But we are already begging the question about higher&#13;
wages in the factory sector. The higher wages in factories--&#13;
which our analysis in Section III establishes--may not be&#13;
artificially raised by institutional factors. Our alternative&#13;
hypothesis offered in Section I would ascribe a large part of&#13;
the wage difference between the sectors to a difference between&#13;
the supply prices of temporary individual migrants on the one&#13;
hand, and those of more permanent family migrants on the other.&#13;
It is to a discussion of this group of issues that we turn in&#13;
Section V.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Chapter V: "TEMPORARINESS" OF MIGRATION, EARNINGS&#13;
AND FAMILY SIZE&#13;
Despite the lack of direct evidence, we have established&#13;
that the three sectors of the Bombay labor market differ substan-&#13;
tially in terms of the propensity of migrant workers to remigrate..&#13;
Migrants in the factory sector, where earnings are highest, have&#13;
typically been in the city longer than migrants in other sectors;&#13;
those in the casual sector, where earnings are lowest, appear to&#13;
be much more recent arrivals. To this extent the positive associa-&#13;
tion of the level of earnings and the permanence of migration has&#13;
been established. In fact, we can go further. The small-scale&#13;
sector sample can be broken down into shops and commercial esta-&#13;
blishments on the one hand, and eating houses and hotels on the&#13;
other. In the latter, which accounts for about a fifth of the&#13;
establishments sampled, a high proportion of those'employed are&#13;
very recent migrants.  Natives were practically non-existent in&#13;
this subsample; migrants with duration of 2'years or less consti-&#13;
tuted 25% of the subsample, and those with'less than 5 years'&#13;
duration 52%. The respective figures for commercial establishments&#13;
and shops were 22% native, 12% migrants with'le'ss than 2 years'&#13;
residence,and 28% migrants with'less than 5 years'.   The earnings&#13;
in eating houses and hotels were substantially lower--almost 45%&#13;
below the average for shops and commercial establishments in&#13;
gross terms, and 22% below.controlling for other significant&#13;
factors such as workers' educational levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
The relationship between the degree of permanence&#13;
of migration and the level of earnings is governed, in the&#13;
hypothesis set out in Section I, by the family size of the&#13;
migrant, which determines his supply price. A stylized&#13;
contrast was presented between the individual migrant who&#13;
is temporarily in the urban labor market all by himself, and&#13;
the permanent type who stays in town with his family. In&#13;
reality, of course, there will be no such stark contrast:&#13;
along with a continuous distribution of migrants by their&#13;
degree of permanence(approximated by the duration of residence),&#13;
we will observe a continuous distribution of family sizes. The&#13;
critical link between the permanence of migration and the supply&#13;
price of the migrant is then his average family size in Bombay or,&#13;
alternatively, the proportion of his total family living with him&#13;
in Bombay.&#13;
A comment on each of the two aspects of the variable&#13;
average family size in Bombay (hereafter called FSB) is called&#13;
for--its relationship to the permanence of migration, and to&#13;
the supply price of migrants. First, Bombay has an unusual&#13;
predominance of single family households. (This is reflected&#13;
in the city's abnormal sex ratio.    The 1971 Census reported&#13;
that there were only 716 females in the city's population for&#13;
every 1,000 males.) The proportion of single-member families&#13;
is substantial in all three sectors of the labor market included&#13;
in our sample survey--45% in the casual, 49% in the small-scale&#13;
and 28% in the factory sector. The proportion of such families&#13;
among migrants drops with duration of residence in the city, but&#13;
is still high among long-term migrants. Even among migrant&#13;
factory workers, about a third of those of 20-25 years duration&#13;
are single-member families. The question that arises is: does&#13;
not this possibility of lone workers being more or less permanent&#13;
migrants undercut the link between FSB and the permanence of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
migration? The answer is that the relationship is valid as&#13;
long as family size in Bombay increases with the duration&#13;
of residence, signifying the necessity of attracting larger&#13;
proportions of bigger families at the margin to achieve a&#13;
more permanent workforce.&#13;
Second, the supply price of migrants can be expected&#13;
to increase with family size because of the higher cost of living&#13;
in town and a higher dependency ratio. I/   But the supply price&#13;
has not been observed. All we can do in the subsequent analysis&#13;
is to test for a significant relationship between FSB and the&#13;
income of the earner. But establishing this link does not prove&#13;
that lower earnings in certain sectors are caused by the lover&#13;
supply price of migrants with smaller families. It is only&#13;
consistent with the hypothesis, and we have to refer to other&#13;
evidence to strengthen the direction of the causal link, if we can.&#13;
Our first task, then, is to assess the'strength of the&#13;
relationship between FSB and the permanence of migration Cas&#13;
approximated by the duration of residencel on the one hand, and&#13;
the income of the principal earner of the'family on the other.&#13;
For each sector, separately, a multivariate analysis of FSB&#13;
was undertaken with the duration of residence in Bombay and&#13;
the income of the principal earner as explanatory variables.&#13;
Control variables were used for the family size'at home (in&#13;
the rural areas) and income of the family in town other than&#13;
that of the principal earner.   In ea'ch sector all four variables&#13;
were significant and together explained 28-37% of the'variance.&#13;
1/ The majority of single migrants were found to be in "free'&#13;
accommodation.  In the factory sector, 14% of the single&#13;
migrants slept at their place of work, 38% lived with&#13;
friends and relatives without any payment, and only 36%&#13;
lived in rented houses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
In the small-scale and the factory sectors, but most of all in the&#13;
casual sector, the income of the principal earner and the duration&#13;
of residence were positively correlated. Hence, we used the inter-&#13;
action terms (in categories of the product of the two variables)&#13;
in the final multiple classification analysis, which is described&#13;
in Annex 1. As an example, the results for the small-scale sector&#13;
are portrayed in Graph I. The major point emerging from the graph&#13;
is that while the average family size of migrants increases both&#13;
with the income of the principal earner and with the duration of&#13;
residence, it is much more sensitive to the former. It is seen&#13;
that even 10 years' duration of residence does not increase migrants'&#13;
family size in Bombay to near the level of the natives, except at&#13;
monthly income levels of Rs. 401-800. On the other hand, migrants&#13;
with an income level above Rs. 800, irrespective 'of their duration&#13;
of residence, have a FSB more like that of Bombay natives.&#13;
If the relationship between the FSB and earnings holds&#13;
within each sector, we can expect the average FSB to vary across&#13;
broad sectors of the labor market in the same way as "net" earnings.&#13;
This is indeed what we find, as the data in Table 14 show.&#13;

All the evidence is thus consistent with a hypothesis of&#13;
wage determination at the individual firm level. Higher wage jobs&#13;
go to migrants who have a long duration of residence and a larger&#13;
family with them in Bombay. The need of more permanent migrants&#13;
to support a larger family in the city causes wages to be higher&#13;
than in other parts of the labor market.&#13;
The causal chain in this hypothesis can be broken only&#13;
if we are able to provide evidence of an alternative mechanism&#13;
for wage differentials. Does the hypothesis that wages are&#13;
institutionally determined provide such an alternative in the&#13;
Bombay labor market? Outside the factory sector there are no&#13;
institutional influences on wages, and thus the evidence of&#13;
differences within the non-factory sector with respect to&#13;
earnings, duration of residence of migrants, and family size&#13;
may be crucial. The fact that throughout the non-factory sector&#13;
earnings rise with the duration of residence and the size of the&#13;
family in Bombay tends to support the hypothesis.&#13;
In the factory sector wages have been institutionally&#13;
determined, along with other conditions of work, for about a decade.&#13;
But two points should be noticed. First, my work on wages in the&#13;
textile industry in the City showed the existence of a substantial&#13;
wage gap with respect to certain other types of labor in the labor&#13;
market for many years, well before the era of institutions. 1/&#13;
Second, it is not at all clear that institutional wage setting&#13;
has increased real earnings of workers in Bombay factories&#13;
significantly since the Second World War. At the same time,&#13;
the factory labor force, as we have seen, shows a very high&#13;
degree of permanence of residence and stability of job tenure--&#13;
even more than it did before the institutional interventions&#13;
of the post-war years.&#13;

Chapter VI:   CONCLUSIONS&#13;
The following are the major conclusions of the paper,&#13;
some less unequivocally proved than others.&#13;
Differences in earnings are substantial between sectors&#13;
of the labor market, and are only reduced when we control for&#13;
factors (such as education) typically allowed for in earnings&#13;
function analysis. Workers in the largest factories earn just&#13;
above twice as much as casual workers.&#13;
Activities with lower levels of earnings have a larger&#13;
proportion of migrants with a short duration of urban residence.&#13;
Taken in conjunction with the distribution of workers by length&#13;
of work in the current job, and the degree of mobility within&#13;
the labor market, this phenomenon suggests a higher incidence&#13;
of return migration in low wage activities.&#13;
Family size in Bombay is also significantly smaller&#13;
for migrants in low wage activities. This finding is consistent&#13;
with the hypothesis which links the lower supply price of tempo-&#13;
rary migrants (because of the smaller family size) to the lower&#13;
wages established in these activities.&#13;
The alternative view of wage differences caused by&#13;
institutional factors is a second runner, because the mechanism&#13;
outlined by us is seen to.operate within the non-factory sector,&#13;
in which institutions do not play any obvious role in wage deter-&#13;
mination. Factory wages in Bombay have been determined by insti-&#13;
tutions since 1950 but there is no evidence to suggest that the&#13;
latter have widened the differential with respect to the non-&#13;
factory sectors beyond what is caused by differences in the&#13;
supply prices of migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
The Harris-Todaro paradigm of migration responding to&#13;
the expectation of an elevated factory sector wage is not useful&#13;
unless it can be demonstrated that wages are, in fact, higher&#13;
than the relevant supply prices. It is further weakened by the&#13;
small number of new jobs opening up for fresh migrants in markets&#13;
like the Bombay one.&#13;
Unemployment before the first urban job was very&#13;
uncommon among Bombay migrants. "Graduation" in the urban&#13;
labor market is significant, but given the low rate of mobility,&#13;
the process does not work quickly enough to make much difference&#13;
to the calculations of migrants.&#13;

Determinants of MonthlZ Earnings of Employees&#13;
The statistical model used for the analysis sought to&#13;
"explain" the log of earnings in terms of the sector of work of&#13;
the employees (SIZE), and a set of human capital variables.&#13;
Since most of the explanatory variables are in categoric terms,&#13;
multiple classification analysis was used to give the logs of&#13;
earnings of each category of workers as deviations from the&#13;
grand mean (5.78) for the entire sample. Column (2) of Table Al&#13;
sets out the number of cases in each of the categories of the&#13;
different variables used. The figures in Column (3) are the&#13;
gross deviations from the grand mean taking each explanatory&#13;
variable separately. Column (4) gives the net deviations which&#13;
are calculated by the program (called Independents). Column (5)&#13;
allows for a further adjustment: the figures of deviations for&#13;
the grand mean in this column are arrived at by controlling for&#13;
2&#13;
Age and (Age) which are entered as continuous explanatory&#13;
variables (called covariates). It is seen that gross deviations&#13;
for the various categories are reduced when other factors are&#13;
controlled for in columns (4) and (5).&#13;
The model performed remarkably well, explaining no less&#13;
than 68 percent of the log-variance of earnings. The program&#13;
gave the significance of the variables included (not shown).&#13;
All of them were significant at the 1% level. The significance&#13;
of the interaction among the independent variables was also tested.&#13;
Only one of the ten possible two-way interactions among the five&#13;
categoric variables turned out to be significant--that between&#13;
SIZE (i.e. sector of work) and OCCUPATION (with an F value of 5.45).&#13;

The relative importance of the sector of work in the&#13;
determination of earnings is revealed first in the relatively&#13;
large spread in earnings between casual workers, on the one hand,&#13;
and the employees in large factories, on the other hand; and&#13;
secondly, in the high value of Beta for this variable in Table Al&#13;
compared to the other variables. 1/ It might be objected that&#13;
the relative importance of EDUCATION has been whittled down in&#13;
the analysis by including other variables such as OCCUPATION, or&#13;
TRAINING, which are related to it. The answer to this question is,&#13;
first, we have already mentioned that the only significant inter-&#13;
action in the model was between SIZE and OCCUPATION, and not,&#13;
surprisingly, between EDUCATION and OCCUPATION. i/ Secondly, we&#13;
tried to analyze the log of earnings with the same program, with&#13;
only three variables: SIZE, EDUCATION and AGE. The results of&#13;
this model (not shown) explained the variance by only about 3&#13;
percentage points less than the larger model. The Beta value for&#13;
EDUCATION was increased from 0.14 to 0.26 and the spread in the&#13;
deviations for the grand mean for the two extreme educational&#13;
categories was also increased from 0.55 to 0.74. The EDUCATION&#13;
effect, however, still remained less than the SIZE effect measured&#13;
either by the Beta value (which was 0.53 for the latter in this&#13;
smaller model) or by the spread in the values of deviations&#13;
(which was 0.84 for SIZE)..&#13;
_                ~~~2.&#13;
-1/ The table gives values for Eta as well as Beta.   Eta  is the&#13;
correlation ratio and indicates the proportion of the total sum&#13;
of squar2s explainable-by the particulir predictor alone. Beta&#13;
and Beta are analogous to Eta and Eta , but are based on the&#13;
adiusted mean rather than the raw mean. Beta provides a measure&#13;
of the ability of the predictor to explain variations in the&#13;
dependent variables after adjusting for the effects of all the&#13;
other predictors.&#13;
2/ This is obviously due to the rather broad definition of white&#13;
collar jobs adopted.&#13;

            Paradigms in the study of urban labor
            markets in LDCs : a reassessment in the light of an
            empirical survey in Bombay City
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The paper analyzes the differences in
            the monthly earnings of workers in three sub-sectors of the
            Bombay labor market. A hypothesis is developed to explain
            the very large net intersectoral differences observed in the
            proportions of temporary migrants, and in the supply prices
            of temporary and permanent migrants. The evidence presented
            on labor turnover and migration is consistent with the
            hypothesis. It suggests a view of the process of migration
            and urban wage determination that is different from the
            current Harris-Todaro paradigm.
