1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. OVERVIEW OF THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
Supply and Demand&#13;
1.1   China has become the third largest producer of energy in the world. The&#13;
country's primary commercial energy supply and consumption increased at around 4.1&#13;
percent per year from 1980 to 1995 to reach 1,239.0 tons of standard coal equivalent&#13;
(tce). Coal is the most important source of energy, accounting for about 74.8 percent, and&#13;
oil for 17.2 percent of the total production. Hydroelectric power (6.1 percent), natural gas&#13;
(1.9 percent), and small quantities of shale oil and geothermal power make up the&#13;
balance. During the same period, the primary energy consumption increased at about 5.1&#13;
percent to reach 1,290.0 tce. The largest consumer of energy is the industrial sector (75.4&#13;
percent), followed by households (9.7 percent), services (8.6 percent), and agriculture&#13;
(6.3 percent). Details of the primary energy outputs are given in Annex 1.1, and total&#13;
energy production and consumption in Annex 1.2.&#13;
Energy Resources&#13;
1.2   Coal. China has large coal deposits, with recoverable reserves of about 900&#13;
billion tons, of which 30 percent are proven. In 1995, the country produced more than&#13;
1.2 billion tons of raw coal. By the year 2000, China aims to produce 1.4 to 1.6 billion&#13;
tons of coal a year. The best quality coals are found in North China, where Shanxi and&#13;
Inner Mongolia each has reserves of about 200 billion tons. However, insufficient&#13;
transport capacity makes it extremely difficult to move sufficient coal to the large&#13;
consumption centers in Central and East China.&#13;
1.3   Hydroelectric Potential. China is rich in water resources and has a long tradition&#13;
of harnessing them for energy and other uses. The country's hydroelectric potential is&#13;
estimated at 1,900 TWh a year, but only about 9 percent of it has been developed. Most&#13;
of the potential is located in the southwest (70 percent), about 1,500 km away from the&#13;
main demand centers. However, the long gestation period for hydroelectric projects and&#13;
the lack of capital have slowed the development and utilization of hydroelectric&#13;
resources.&#13;
1.4   Crude Oil. China's ultimately recoverable reserves of crude oil are estimated at&#13;
some 80 billion tons, of which approximately 20 percent are proven. The 1995&#13;
production amounted to about 150 million tons of crude oil and cumulative production&#13;
reached about 2.45 billion tons. China's refining capacity is the sixth largest in the&#13;
world. However, with the sharply increasing consumption, the country will become net&#13;
importer in the near future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
1.5   Natural Gas. China's natural gas resources are estimated at 33 trillion m3, of&#13;
which 3 to 5 percent are proven. In 1995, China produced 17.7 billion m3 of natural gas.&#13;
About 58 percent of the current production is nonassociated gas, mostly from Sichuan&#13;
Province. The remaining gas production is associated with onshore crude oil production.&#13;
1.6   Biomass. Noncommercial biomass energy use currently amounts to about one&#13;
quarter of total energy consumption in China. Fuelwood and agricultural residues are the&#13;
chief biomass fuels, and they are consumed almost entirely by rural households. China is&#13;
promoting a variety of measures to achieve environmentally sustainable biomass supply&#13;
and consumption levels, including more efficient use of biomass, tree planting, and&#13;
substitution of other fuels for traditional biomass fuels.&#13;
1.7   Nuclear Energy. Known uranium reserves in China are sufficient to sustain&#13;
15,000 MW of nuclear power capacity for 30 years. China commissioned its first&#13;
commercial nuclear power plant (300 MW) in 1992, in Zhejiang Province. In 1993/94,&#13;
the Daya Bay nuclear power plant (2x900 MW) was also commissioned; 70 percent of its&#13;
output is intended for nearby Hong Kong. The construction of a few additional plants is&#13;
planned to start before the year 2000, primarily in regions which lack coal and&#13;
hydroelectric resources.&#13;
1.8   Other Energy Resources. Other energy resources play a small role in energy&#13;
supply and are used mostly in remote areas. Geothermal energy has been found in&#13;
locations throughout the country. Although wind and solar energy have promising&#13;
prospects, they are not expected to significantly affect the overall supply of energy in the&#13;
near future. Oil shale deposits are large, but little is exploited because of lack of viable&#13;
technology.&#13;
B. THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
Supply and Demand&#13;
1.9   China is the second largest producer of electricity in the world. By the end of&#13;
1995, China's total installed capacity reached about 217.2 GW, 75 percent of which is&#13;
thermal capacity and the rest hydropower (24 percent) and nuclear power (1 percent)&#13;
(Annex 1.3). China has five regional and eight separate provincial power networks, of&#13;
which seven have installed capacities of 10 GW or more. The five regional power grids&#13;
(East China, North China, Northeast China, Central China and Northwest China)&#13;
coordinate the systems of several provinces and municipalities together. The total length&#13;
of the high and medium-voltage transmission lines (i.e., from 500 kV down to 110 kV)&#13;
lines amounted to 267,500 km and the transformer capacity of substations down to the&#13;
110 kV at the secondary level (owned and operated by the power utilities) was about&#13;
234 GVA. Considering the power supply as a whole from production to end-user supply,&#13;
transmission and distribution losses are estimated at about 16 percent of generation.&#13;
1.10  Total power generation in China increased by more than two and one-half times&#13;
between 1980 and 1995, an average increase of 8.0 percent per year over 14 years. About&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1,007 TWh were generated in 1995, with thermal power accounting for 80 percent. The&#13;
share of hydroelectric power has remained fairly stable over the last decade. Even though&#13;
the Government has maintained a strong commitment to hydropower development,&#13;
capital constraints and the distance of major resources from load centers inhibit more&#13;
rapid development. Coal-fired power plants provide more than 90 percent of thermal&#13;
generation, with oil-fired generation accounting for most of the balance. The share of oil-&#13;
fired generation has declined sharply since the early 1980s, owing to a concerted&#13;
government policy to minimize petroleum use for power. The share of natural-gas based&#13;
generation is negligible and is expected to remain so unless major natural gas discoveries&#13;
are made.&#13;
1.11  Industry continues to dominate electricity consumption in China, accounting for&#13;
74.9 percent of electricity use in 1995; agriculture accounted for 6.2 percent, residential&#13;
consumers for 10.2 percent, municipal and commercial consumers for 6.9 percent, and&#13;
transport and communications for 1.8 (Annex 1.4). Industrial demand has continued to&#13;
drive overall power demand; more than 71.5 percent of incremental electricity use&#13;
between 1985 and 1995 was in the industrial sector. Although service is of uneven&#13;
quality, rural access to electricity is high; about 96 percent of the nation's villages and&#13;
about 80 percent of rural families now have access to electricity.&#13;
1.12  Despite the strong growth in electricity output, most areas of China continue to&#13;
suffer from severe power shortages. Since GDP grew by 9.3 percent per year during&#13;
1980-95, the elasticity of electricity consumption growth relative to GDP growth was&#13;
only 0.86-an exceptionally low elasticity for any country over a sustained period, and&#13;
particularly for an industrializing country such as China. Chinese officials estimate the&#13;
shortfall between peak power demand and supply at more than 10 percent. Daily load&#13;
curves are relatively flat, as industries have had to respond to power shortages during the&#13;
peak daytime periods through rescheduling of work shifts. It is expected that power&#13;
shortages will be more acute in the two to three coming years because of accumulated&#13;
delays in power projects due to financial constraints.&#13;
1.13  China's GDP is expected to grow by at least 8 to 9 percent per year during the&#13;
ninth five-year plan (1996-2000). This rapid economic growth will put tremendous&#13;
pressure on China's electric power industry to avoid yet worse shortages. China's&#13;
electric power construction program for the 1990s will certainly be the world's largest.&#13;
Assuming that an aggressive conservation effort can enable an electricity demand/GDP&#13;
growth elasticity of 1.0 to be sustained, electricity demand could be expected to continue&#13;
to grow at average rates of 8 to 9 percent per year during 1996-2000. To keep pace with&#13;
this demand growth, China would need to add some 17-20 GW of capacity per year. The&#13;
total investment in China in 1995 was Y 1,945 billion, of which Y 101 billion (5.2&#13;
percent) was in the power sector.&#13;
1.14  Although China's current power development program emphasizes addition of&#13;
300 to 600 MW units, over one half of China's thermal power capacity is still in units&#13;
below 200 MW. Only about 12 percent of the total installed capacity is in units of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
300 MW or more, compared to 60 to 80 percent in industrialized countries. The average&#13;
gross conversion efficiency of thermal units over 6 MW has improved over the 1980s,&#13;
reaching about 33 percent in 1995. This efficiency level is not unreasonable given the&#13;
low average unit sizes in operation, but is substantially lower than the 36 to 37 percent&#13;
typical of reasonably efficient systems with larger units.&#13;
Power Sector Institutions&#13;
1.15 In the period 1988-92, the Ministry of Energy (MOE) maintained primary&#13;
responsibility within the Central Government for policy, planning and regulation of the&#13;
power and related energy subsectors. In May 1993, MOE was restructured during a&#13;
broad government reorganization, and a Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) was&#13;
established, along with a Ministry of Coal and the existing China National Petroleum&#13;
Corporation. Chart 1 shows the entities that are within MOEP oversight. The State&#13;
Planning Commission (SPC), on behalf of the State Council, has the responsibility for&#13;
review and approval of the strategic plans, investment programs and general pricing&#13;
policy of the energy sector. The Ministry of Water Resources still supervises rural&#13;
electrification and development of decentralized power systems in approximately 800&#13;
counties relying mostly on small hydropower.&#13;
1.16  Until early 1993, the State Energy Investment Corporation (SEIC) channeled&#13;
Government funds to finance coal and power projects. SEIC was responsible for&#13;
onlending funds for projects of national importance and representing the central&#13;
Government in jointly financed projects. However, in April 1994, SEIC (and five other&#13;
specialized investment companies under SPC) were merged into a new policy bank, the&#13;
State Development Bank (SDB). The Construction Bank of China usually performs&#13;
policy lending as a disbursement/collection agency for SDB, and commercial banking&#13;
activities on its own account. For provincial power companies, equity and loans/debt&#13;
representing central government's contribution are channeled through the regional&#13;
groups. In some cases, such as Ertan Hydropower Electric Company Ltd., equity stakes&#13;
are held by the State Development Investment Corporation (SDIC).&#13;
C. POWER SECTOR REFORMS-PROGRESS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS&#13;
1.17  Reforms in China's power sector during the 1980s involved a series of&#13;
incremental adjustments, largely to mobilize additional investment capital to finance&#13;
rapid growth. Taken as a whole, these adjustments have resulted in a sector structure that&#13;
is largely unrecognizable from that in the early 1980s. In 1980, the power sector was&#13;
fully controlled, managed and funded by Central Government departments. By the early&#13;
1990s, the sector had become much more decentralized, less vertically integrated and&#13;
open to nonutility producers.&#13;
1.18  In conformance with broad national reforms toward a market economy begun in&#13;
mid-1992, the Government initiated, in the early 1990s, a program of power sector&#13;
reforms. The reform agenda includes: (a) overhaul of the regulatory and legal&#13;
framework for the sector; (b) further diversification in financing for power development,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
including private sector participation; (c) institutional restructuring-commercialization&#13;
and corporatization of power companies, and associated sector restructuring; and (d) the&#13;
rationalization of power tariffs.  The Chinese approach to reform  encourages&#13;
experimentation with different reform options and institutional forms. This gradual&#13;
approach permits the Chinese to examine the relevance and applicability of specific&#13;
reforms, and also to fine-tune implementation for their broader dissemination or&#13;
replication in other parts of the country.&#13;
1.19 Legal and Regulatory Reform. China recently undertook two important steps in&#13;
its legal and regulatory reform agenda. First, the Standing Committee of the 17th session&#13;
of the National People's Congress passed the first "Electricity Law of the People's&#13;
Republic of China," which became effective on April 1, 1996 (Box 1.1). Second, the&#13;
State Council (a) approved the creation of the National Power Grid Company, which will&#13;
operate the future national (interregional) transmission network; and (b) proposed for&#13;
consideration by the National People's Congress a restructuring plan that provides for&#13;
abolition of MOEP and transfer of regulatory and policy functions to the State Economic&#13;
and Trade Commission (SETC), the State Planning Commission (SPC) and the China&#13;
Electricity Council. A State Power Company has been created and entrusted with the&#13;
ownership functions of the central government and development of interregional&#13;
transmission systems.&#13;
1.20 An important and innovative experiment in regulatory reform is being conducted&#13;
in Hainan Province to make the transition to an unbundled sector structure with separate&#13;
regulation.  Actions undertaken include:  creation of a single transmission and&#13;
distribution shareholding company; several generating companies, including a wholly&#13;
foreign-owned one; and establishment on June 1, 1995 of a separate agency to regulate&#13;
the sector. Lessons learned from this experiment will be taken into account in furthering&#13;
the power sector reform efforts in other provinces. A more ambitious experiment is&#13;
under consideration for Fujian Province.&#13;
1.21  Diversification of Financing. Following changes in power project financing&#13;
from Government grants to loans in the early 1980s, the Government encouraged the&#13;
development of additional financing sources from provincial and local governments,&#13;
large consumers, and, in some cases, private foreign partners. Since the mid-1980s, the&#13;
Government has allowed power produced from power plants financed through these&#13;
nontraditional sources to be sold at prices which provide for full debt servicing and&#13;
reasonable profit. This is referred to as the "new plant, new price policy." Empowered&#13;
with rights to impose surcharges to accumulate funds for investment in power&#13;
construction, provincial and local governments have become a key source of financing,&#13;
providing more than half of the investment funding for the sector in 1995. As a&#13;
consequence, the share of Central Government financing in power sector investment has&#13;
fallen sharply, from 91 percent (mostly through State Budget allocations) in 1980 to less&#13;
than 35 percent in 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Box 1.1: THE ELECTRIC POWER LAW FOR THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA&#13;
On December 28, 1995, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress enacted a&#13;
comprehensive new law that applies to every part of the power sector. The Electric Power Law became&#13;
effective April 1996, and is intended to support reforms necessary to introduce the socialist market&#13;
economy to the power sector.&#13;
The Electric Power Law generally specifies broad principles that must be implemented through the&#13;
issuance of additional State Council regulations and other legal instruments. The Electric Power Law&#13;
provides a solid foundation upon which to establish an adequate regulatory system. However, consistent&#13;
with the direction of reforms for the Chinese economy, the Electric Power Law has the following specific&#13;
objectives:&#13;
.  To encourage the development of the power industry consistent with development of a socialist&#13;
market economy.&#13;
* To encourage the development of poor and rural areas.&#13;
* To encourage private investment in power generation, but not in other power sector activities,&#13;
such as transmission and distribution.&#13;
. To protect the legal interests of power enterprises, investors, and power customers.&#13;
* To encourage the development of renewable resources and new technology.&#13;
* To protect the safety of power facilities and installations.&#13;
The Electric Power Law covers the construction of power facilities and the supply of power in China and&#13;
applies to both Chinese and foreign companies. The Law includes 10 chapters and covers, among other&#13;
things, electric power construction, electric power and electric network management, supply and utilization&#13;
of power, power tariffs, rural electric power construction and agricultural use of power, and the protection&#13;
of electric facilities.&#13;
The Electric Power Law includes several provisions directly relevant to the design and creation of the legal&#13;
framework for the power sector, including the following:&#13;
* Article 6 sets forth the government institutions responsible for regulation of the power sector.&#13;
* Article 7 guarantees power enterprises' rights to operate autonomously subject to government&#13;
supervision.&#13;
* Articles 10 through 12 set forth requirements governing power sector planning.&#13;
* Articles 18 through 23 set forth requirements for power production and electric network system&#13;
service.&#13;
* Article 25 requires issuance of power supply licenses to serve customers within exclusive&#13;
geographic service territories.&#13;
* Articles 26 through 34 set forth the service requirements that must be satisfied by power supply&#13;
enterprises and the specific rights and obligations of customers.&#13;
* Articles 25 through 35 set forth principles that govern tariff determinations and that allocate tariff&#13;
responsibilities among different levels within the government.&#13;
* Articles 56 through 58 authorize inspections for the purposes of enforcement of legal and&#13;
regulatory requirements.&#13;
* Articles 59 through 74 set forth penalties for violations of various provisions of the Electric&#13;
Power Law.&#13;
1.22 Newly formed corporations have also become important players. The Huaneng&#13;
International Power Development Corporation (HIPDC) was formed in 1985 with the aim&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of attracting foreign capital and technology for power plants located mainly in coastal&#13;
areas. As an independent power producer, HIPDC operates its 11 plants (6,700 MW&#13;
total) under a build, own and operate (BOO) framework. HIPDC had a mandate to raise&#13;
funds from the international financial market. It has been able to tap bilateral and export&#13;
credits, and commercial bank loans, and to raise foreign equity capital through an&#13;
American Depository Receipt (ADR) issue in New York in 1994. The Sunburst Energy&#13;
Development Corporation (SEDC), with three large power projects under&#13;
implementation, and the recently established China Power Investment Corporation&#13;
(CPIC) are other windows for the Government's investment, and cofinancing with the&#13;
local governments and foreign sources in power projects. Several joint ventures have&#13;
been established to build several power plants with capacity ranging from 40 MW to&#13;
700 MW. Two major joint venture projects have been recently approved in Shandong&#13;
Province (Rizhao power plant-2x350 MW coal-fired units) and in Shanghai (Zhadian&#13;
power plant-4x 100 MW gas turbines).&#13;
1.23  Build, own and transfer (BOT) schemes have also been introduced in China, most&#13;
notably the privately-financed Shajiao B and Shajiao C thermal power plants in&#13;
Guangdong Province, respectively commissioned in 1986 and 1996. Another major BOT&#13;
project sponsored by two international consortia have been approved by SPC in 1993 in&#13;
Fujian Province (Meizhou Wan power plant-2x350 MW coal-fired units). The process&#13;
of international competitive tendering for projects has also begun. SPC approved the Lai&#13;
Bin B project in the Guangxi Autonomous Region to be the first power project to pilot&#13;
the international competitive bidding framework. SPC invited 12 of the 31 companies/&#13;
consortia that sought prequalification to bid competitively for the Lai Bin B project. Six&#13;
international consortia participated in the competition. Bids were opened in May 1996&#13;
and an 18-year concession was awarded to the winning consortium on November 11,&#13;
1996. Bids will shortly be issued for Changsha project in Hunan Province.&#13;
D. POWER PRICING&#13;
1.24  Electricity price reform in China has involved a series of incremental changes&#13;
over the last 10 years. In the mid-1980s, multiple-track pricing was introduced for both&#13;
producers and consumers, in line with the shift away from full vertical integration in the&#13;
industry. This strategy was successful in increasing overall tariff levels but, by the end of&#13;
the decade, the power pricing system had become too complex and difficult to manage.&#13;
Recent reforms have therefore focused on simplification and rationalization of the&#13;
system.&#13;
1.25  At the producer level, the state catalog prices charged for power produced by&#13;
Central Government-financed plants were modified in 1993. Prices for the electricity&#13;
produced from all new power plants are now set by contract to cover financing and&#13;
operating costs (guidance prices), on a plant-by-plant basis, and rolled into the average&#13;
power tariff. Cost recovery through the tariff system for new investments is thus ensured.&#13;
Prices also are similarly determined for existing plants financed through loans. The&#13;
electricity tariff applied for plants built with grant financing before 1985 has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
rationalized to now include an improved mechanism to automatically adjust prices&#13;
annually to reflect fuel and transportation cost variations. Following the enactment of the&#13;
Electricity Law, the dialogue between the Chinese government and the Bank focused on&#13;
implementation of the new pricing principles to ensure that producer prices reflect the&#13;
level and structure of the cost supply (introduction of a capacity and energy payment&#13;
formula) and are conducive to economic dispatch and optimum production efficiency.&#13;
1.26  At the consumer level, the prices are in general an average of the state catalog&#13;
prices and the guidance prices (that reflect full costs of supply from sources not financed&#13;
through the Central Government) plus national and local fees and surcharges. While the&#13;
situation varies between regions, the nature of the existing pricing system is such that&#13;
average consumer prices (including fees and surcharges) approximate long-run marginal&#13;
cost levels in areas with rapid load growth, such as the coastal provinces. However, the&#13;
average prices in some of these provinces increased at a slower pace than the long-run&#13;
marginal cost due to limitation of price increases to control inflation in 1995 and 1996.&#13;
The average consumer price in these areas still covers more than 85 percent of the long-&#13;
run marginal cost. Prices in underdeveloped areas, such as Sichuan and Henan, are still&#13;
below long-run marginal cost levels, but are being gradually rationalized with increasing&#13;
supply from new plants.&#13;
1.27  While consumer tariffs, are approaching satisfactory levels, their structure remains&#13;
too complex, lacks transparency, and is inequitable. In most areas, including some North&#13;
China systems, unfair "old" administered rates (based on catalog prices) and "new" rates&#13;
(including higher prices for new power) continue to be applied to different consumers&#13;
through a complex quota system.  Some consumers are protected from  high-cost&#13;
electricity supply charges and certain local surcharges because they still hold "in-plan"&#13;
quota allocations, but other new or small consumers must pay high prices well above&#13;
actual supply costs. Following the enactment of the Electricity Law, further and speedier&#13;
progress is expected on abolishing the two-track pricing system (unification of tariffs has&#13;
been reaffirmed by article 37 of the Electricity Law) and improving the tariff structure to&#13;
reflect the costs of supply of final consumers.&#13;
E. ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION&#13;
Electricity Conservation&#13;
1.28  China has over 10 years of experience in the active promotion of electricity&#13;
conservation, with a solid record of achievement. The strength of its program lies in the&#13;
well-developed institutional framework. Electricity conservation is handled by the&#13;
network of "Three Electricity Offices," with offices at central, provincial, prefectural and&#13;
county levels throughout the country. These offices are under the leadership of local&#13;
Economic Commissions, and coordinate their work with provincial power companies.&#13;
They monitor electricity intensity and use patterns in all major enterprises, promote&#13;
adoption of conservation technologies and electricity management improvements, and&#13;
assist in organizing funding for efficiency programs supported by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.29  These measures have been successful, as is indicated by the low ratio of elasticity&#13;
of growth in electricity demand to GDP growth of 0.86 achieved during 1980-95.&#13;
However, energy electricity conservation programs have always been based on centrally&#13;
designed energy/electricity conservation policies and heavily-subsidized administrative&#13;
programs. Faced with constrained fiscal revenues, the government is now promoting a&#13;
shift in the energy conservation programs to rely more on market-based incentives and&#13;
introduce innovative and commercially-based contractual and financing mechanisms.&#13;
Environmental Protection&#13;
1.30 Thermal power production currently accounts for about one third of China's coal&#13;
consumption, and this share is expected to increase gradually. Improvements in the&#13;
efficiency of coal use in this sector not only alleviate pressure on the coal production and&#13;
transportation system, but also have a major impact on particulate, sulfur and carbon&#13;
dioxide emissions.&#13;
1.31  The achievement of economies of scale in thermal power production, through&#13;
expanded development of large generating units, is a priority because of the recent rapid&#13;
growth of small coal-fired power plants, in unit sizes of 50 MW or less. While national&#13;
policy emphasizes the addition of 300 MW and 600 MW units, new projects have lagged&#13;
behind demand and local governments are continuing to invest in large numbers of new&#13;
small plants, largely due to difficulties in mobilizing the necessary investment resources.&#13;
Compared with a state-of-the-art plant, these plants consume over 60 percent more coal&#13;
per unit of electricity produced. This results in at least 60 percent higher sulfur dioxide&#13;
(SO2) emissions (depending upon the coal used), and roughly 60 percent greater&#13;
emissions of carbon dioxide.  Particulate emissions from  the small plants are&#13;
proportionally even higher, due to use of inefficient particulate control technology. If a&#13;
sufficient number of large-scale projects cannot be brought on stream in a timely fashion&#13;
to substitute smaller inefficient units, there is little doubt that this problem will worsen.&#13;
1.32 In terms of emission control in large- and medium-scale plants, China has made&#13;
substantial progress in particulate control, through deployment of high-efficiency&#13;
electrostatic precipitators. As the country has large reserves of low-sulfur coal, China is&#13;
just beginning to employ SO2 control devices in areas where ambient air quality standards&#13;
require them. Top priority should be given to areas that must rely on local high-sulfur&#13;
coal, such as in southwest China. In these regions, thermal power plants often bum coal&#13;
of over 4 percent sulfur content (e.g., 5 to 10 times the level typical through most of north&#13;
and east China), and development of SO2 control strategies and corresponding&#13;
investments are now urgent in these areas. Several pilot flue gas desulfurization (FGD)&#13;
projects have been implemented in areas where the sulfur content of coal is relatively&#13;
high: Luohang in Sichuan Province, Japanese-assisted projects in Shandong Province&#13;
and Taiyuan in Shanxi Province.&#13;
1.33  Recently, the Chinese Government initiated serious efforts to curb air pollution&#13;
related to the burning of coal and particularly to reduce the power sector's contribution to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
the problem. The Government also announced its intention to keep particulate emissions&#13;
at about 3.8 million tons (1992 level). It also announced in June 1994 that it will spend&#13;
about $2 billion over the next seven years on an environmental program aimed at keeping&#13;
SO2 emissions at a level of 15 million metric tons a year, as part of a comprehensive&#13;
program of acid rain abatement. An SO2 emission tax (from Y 0.15 to 0.2/kg of SO2) is&#13;
being experimented with in several provinces and municipalities and a tax (Y 0.04/kg of&#13;
SO2) is applied to emissions exceeding the 1982 standards in all provinces. Several&#13;
municipalities, such as Shanghai, issued very stringent environmental regulations and&#13;
increased efforts to enforce existing regulations by imposing fines on industrial units and&#13;
power plants that do not comply with emission standards and/or imposing use of flue gas&#13;
desulfiurization for all new plants.  However, achievement of the Government's&#13;
environmental objectives still requires a more adequate enforcement of the national&#13;
regulations.&#13;
F. ROLE OF THE WORLD BANK&#13;
World Bank Power Sector Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.34 In line with Bankwide policies, the Bank's energy assistance program in China&#13;
places special emphasis on sector reform and energy conservation. During the last two&#13;
years, the Bank's technical assistance program for the power sector has focused on&#13;
helping the Chinese in assessing reform options (through a study funded by the Bank's&#13;
Institutional Development Fund), defining implementation strategies (through sector&#13;
work on power sector reform), and exploring options for mobilizing domestic and foreign&#13;
private funds to meet the capital needs of sector development (through informal sector&#13;
work). The study (Strategic Options in Power Sector Reform in China, 1993) and sector&#13;
report (China Power Sector Reform: Toward Competition and Improved Performance,&#13;
Report 12929-CHA, 1994) provide vehicles for dialogue between the Bank and Chinese&#13;
institutions. Technical assistance is also now being provided to help the central&#13;
authorities develop an improved legal and regulatory framework for the sector. The&#13;
energy conservation support program includes technical assistance through the Global&#13;
Environment Facility (GEF), lending support to selected industrial, environrent and&#13;
energy projects, and development of a series of new Bank/GEF investment operations.&#13;
The power sector lending program now focuses on assistance for: (a) the detailed aspects&#13;
of implementation of the power sector reforms, (b) balanced development of generation&#13;
and transmission to reduce the power shortages and transmission bottlenecks that&#13;
continue to hamper development and slow the market orientation of the sector,&#13;
(c) increased efficiency at the supply and end-use levels, and (d) enhanced environmental&#13;
protection.&#13;
Bank Involvement&#13;
1.35  The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
for China presented to the Board on March 18, 1997. It supports the joint agenda of the&#13;
Chinese Government and the World Bank to improve the efficiency and minimize the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
environmental impacts of electricity delivery and use while concurrently alleviating&#13;
existing power shortages and satisfying the surging demand. These objectives will be&#13;
achieved through (a) installation of larger generating units to take advantage of higher&#13;
fuel efficiency and economies of scale; (b) mine-mouth location of generating plants to&#13;
reduce the cost of coal delivered to the plant, and reduce overloading on the railway&#13;
system; (c) minimize action of pollution loads in densely populated areas with low local&#13;
absorptive capacity; and (d) introduction of market-based policies and competition&#13;
(where possible) and opening the sector further to domestic and foreign private investors.&#13;
1.36  Under the proposed project, the establishment of a limited liability company as an&#13;
independent power producer will significantly support commercialization of the sector,&#13;
and will pave the way for other independent power producers, including those owned by&#13;
private investors.  Following the successful approach of the Ertan Hydropower&#13;
Development Company, the Tuoketuo Electric Power Generation Company (TEPGC)&#13;
will be the first nonutility thermal power generator in China directly supported by the&#13;
Bank. The divestiture of generation assets, for which technical assistance is included in&#13;
the project, and the use of funds raised on international financial markets to finance&#13;
equity in TEPGC would be a significant step toward eliminating barriers to entry,&#13;
opening the power sector to private investors and introducing competition at the&#13;
generation level. The power purchase agreement can serve as a model for other IPPs and&#13;
also help develop North China Power Group Company's (NCPGC) role as a purchasing&#13;
agent and thereby stimulate unbundling of and power trade within the North China&#13;
system. Furthermore, improved energy efficiency at the generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution levels will reduce the adverse environmental impacts of electricity generation&#13;
and usage.&#13;
G. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.37  Since the first project for the power sector in 1982, the Bank has helped to finance&#13;
18 large power generation and load management projects, eight thermal, eight hydro, and&#13;
two transmission projects (Annex 1.5). Technical assistance in project management,&#13;
system operations, finance, management and institutional reform has been included in the&#13;
projects. Through these operations, the Bank has helped to introduce: (a) state-of-art&#13;
technologies and control systems in generation, transmission, distribution and pollution&#13;
control; (b) modern operational practices and procedures to improve power system&#13;
reliability and control; (c) improved methods for project planning, design, construction&#13;
management, and environmental impact assessment; (d) improved financial planning and&#13;
utility management tools and practices; (e) techniques for computing and establishing&#13;
appropriate tariff structures and levels; and (f) assistance in sector and regulatory reform.&#13;
1.38  The past operations in China, especially the eight thermal power projects, yielded&#13;
useful lessons on project preparation, technical and operating aspects of power systems&#13;
and sequencing of institutional reform. The experience gained from these projects and&#13;
broader international experience in power sector restructuring have also been taken into&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
account in developing a power sector strategy to be pursued by the Bank in China, and in&#13;
designing focused and implementable institutional changes.&#13;
1.39  Lessons learned from the previous thermal power projects were considered during&#13;
preparation of the proposed project in order to: (a) improve the project management and&#13;
ensure proper coordination between the different contractors; (b) improve the quality of&#13;
the environmental studies, environmental management plans and monitoring measures;&#13;
and (c) ensure commitment of the beneficiary(ies) to the institutional and corporate&#13;
reforms to be included in the project. Actions have been taken to involve international&#13;
consultants in assisting the beneficiary(ies) to: (a) assess the environmental impacts of&#13;
the project and designing the proper measures to address them, (b) incorporate the new&#13;
generating company, and (c) prepare a power purchase agreement in line with&#13;
international practice. Finally, a serious boiler accident at the Beilungang power station&#13;
in Zhejiang province will be taken into account in boiler design and specifications, coal&#13;
and "check coal" specifications, and adequate measures of coal quality monitoring.&#13;
1.40  In power sector restructuring and reform implementation, international experience&#13;
shows that even in advanced countries with strong and transparent institutional systems&#13;
and well-established market economies, the time needed to build consensus on the reform&#13;
directions, establish a new regulatory framework, and implement structural changes can&#13;
be very long. China faces the same problems witnessed in Central and Eastern Europe.&#13;
Hopes for achieving quick progress in economic regulation and restructuring of the power&#13;
sectors in these countries have been unfulfilled because of the intricate links of&#13;
institutional changes to politics, complex macroeconomic reforms to ensure the transition&#13;
toward market economy without disruption, and the difficult implementation of adequate&#13;
and credible legal and regulatory frameworks. Therefore, the proposed project focuses on&#13;
limited implementable priority actions to improve the commercial orientation of the&#13;
beneficiaries, improve the contractual arrangements, increase competition and improve&#13;
operational efficiency of the sector.&#13;

2. THE POWER MARKET&#13;
A. AN OVERVIEW&#13;
2.1   The Tuoketuo Thermal Power Project is located in Inner Mongolia, and is being&#13;
developed to meet growing electricity demand in the north China power system, which&#13;
covers three provinces (Hebei, Shanxi, West Inner Mongolia) and two municipalities&#13;
(Beijing, Tianjin). Most of the project output will be exported to the Beijing area where&#13;
electricity demand has been suppressed but still increased at about 8 percent per year&#13;
through the first half of the 1990s. In 1995 the city's peak electricity demand was&#13;
4,091 MW and consumption was 22,260 GWh, corresponding to a load factor of 62.1&#13;
percent. Generation in Beijing in that year was 13,000 GWh, so that 41.6 percent of&#13;
electricity consumed was imported, primarily from the West Inner Mongolia and Shanxi.&#13;
2.2  Inner Mongolia has proven reserves of more than 200 billion tons of good-quality&#13;
coal. Transport limitation have restricted the development of this potential. Therefore,&#13;
the central government is promoting the development of mine-mouth power plants in&#13;
inland coal rich provinces (especially Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous&#13;
Region) and transfer of electricity to important load centers.&#13;
2.3   There are two separate grids in Inner Mongolia, the East Inner Mongolia Power&#13;
Grid that is connected to the Northeast Power Network and the West Inner Mongolia&#13;
Power Grid (WIMPG) that is part of the north China power system. The WIMPG is a net&#13;
exporter of electricity. It is connected to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid&#13;
(referred to as Jing-Jin-Tang power grid or JJTPG). The JJTPG is a major consuming&#13;
center owing to the concentration of high urban population and industries. Power&#13;
exchanges occur through two 500 kV lines (Datong to Fangshan) and (Fengzheng to&#13;
Shalingzi). There is also a 220 kV interconnection. The power and energy transmitted&#13;
from the WIMPG to the JJTPG are shown in Table 2.1.&#13;
TABLE 2.1: ELECTRICITY EXPORTS FROM THE WIMPG TO THE JJTPG&#13;
Annual&#13;

2.4   Starting from 1990, along with the increase of generating capacity and power&#13;
output, the WIMPG began to transfer power to the JJTPG. The electricity exports&#13;
increased sixfold during 1990-95 from 0.6 to 4.2 TWh. This trend is expected to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14 -&#13;
continue since numerous studies (especially the joint SPC/World Bank study on&#13;
Investment Strategies for China's Coal and Delivery System and the least-cost study&#13;
carried out during the preparation of the proposed project) demonstrated the economic&#13;
and environmental benefits to generate power in the northwest coal bases and transfer it&#13;
to important load centers in the northeast. Inner Mongolia has been listed as the major&#13;
electric power base to supply energy to the Jing-Jin-Tang area. The Inner Mongolia&#13;
Electric Power Company (IMEPC) has plans to increase its power exports up to 10 GW,&#13;
half of its installed capacity by the year 2000.&#13;
B. LOAD FORECAST&#13;
2.5   The load forecasts for the WIMPG and the JJTPG during the period 1996-2010&#13;
were prepared by IMEPC and NCPGC for the Ninth Five-Year Plan. The load&#13;
forecasting is based on a combination of econometric and analytical methods. The&#13;
econometric methods are based on the premise that electricity conservation efforts would&#13;
be sustained to keep the 0.8-0.9 elasticity of electricity consumption to GNP experienced&#13;
in the early 1990s. The analytical methods are based on (a) market surveys and&#13;
development plans of the major electricity consumers to determine the sectoral output&#13;
growths, and (b) electricity intensities for the different sectors to determine future&#13;
electricity consumptions taking into account load management and electricity&#13;
conservation measures. The corresponding load forecasts are summarized in Table 2.2.&#13;

2.6   During the next decade, the peak demand would increase by about 14,000 MW in&#13;
JJTPG and about 2,000 MW in the WIMPG. While the capacity addition requirements in&#13;
the WIMPG are relatively modest, the potential for electricity transfer to the JJTPG and&#13;
the Beijing region is considerable. The proposed project (1,200 MW) accounts for less&#13;
than 10 percent of the capacity needed to alleviate shortages and meet future electricity&#13;
requirements in the JJTPG. It is highly unlikely that it will encounter significant market&#13;
risks even in case of full scale development of the site (3,600 MW).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
C. THE ROLE OF THE PROJECT&#13;
2.7   The proposed project addresses development of the North China power system in&#13;
an integrated approach based on (a) increase of electricity supply through creation of an&#13;
independent generation company (TEPGC) to develop a mine-mouth power plant in Inner&#13;
Mongolia and insure adequate supply to the Jing-Jin-Tang area through long-term&#13;
contractual arrangements; and (b) a transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) component&#13;
including investments in the transmission system to improve the reliability and quality of&#13;
supply in Beijing and in rehabilitation of a pilot distribution area to reduce losses and&#13;
improve efficiency.&#13;
2.8   The proposed project, located in Tuoketuo county of the Inner Mongolia&#13;
Autonomous region would ease the power shortage in the JJTPG area, which includes the&#13;
fast-growing municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin.  It was selected following&#13;
consideration of different alternatives, mainly construction of plants close to the load&#13;
centers in the JJTPG or construction of mine-mouth plants in Shanxi Province and&#13;
transmission of the electricity to the JJTPG. Building the facilities in Tuoketuo was&#13;
found to be the most economically and environmentally attractive option.&#13;
2.9    Overall, the project is expected to have the least detrimental impacts on the&#13;
environment, compared to available alternatives. The plants to be constructed under the&#13;
project will introduce the first two 600 MW baseload units in West Inner Mongolia&#13;
system. The units are designed to meet strict atmospheric emission standards and&#13;
minimize other environmental impacts. The new capacity additions will result in reduced&#13;
use, and retirement of older, less efficient and more polluting plants.&#13;
2.10  Investment in the transmission and distribution networks in Beijing over the last&#13;
decade have not kept pace with the increase in consumer demand. Consequently, the&#13;
systems, especially in the city center, are characterized by: (a) losses that are above&#13;
economic levels, (b) a reliability level that is lower than that appropriate for the country's&#13;
capital city, and (c) inadequate voltage regulation in some areas. To ensure adequate&#13;
supplies, it is necessary to introduce more injection points at higher transmission voltages&#13;
closer to the city center and to upgrade the heavily loaded distribution system. These&#13;
measures will improve supply reliability, reduce losses and improve the quality of&#13;
consumer service. The component will achieve these objectives through construction of&#13;
new substations, installing reactive compensation, increasing transformer capacities in&#13;
existing substations, installing more efficient distribution transformers and increasing the&#13;
sizes of conductors on many distribution lines. These investments are needed to ensure&#13;
that the power to be transmitted from the Tuoketuo power station to Beijing can be&#13;
efficiently relayed to end-users with accepted standards of quality.&#13;
&#13;

3. THE BENEFICIARIES&#13;
3.1   There will be two beneficiaries of the proposed World Bank loan for the&#13;
implementation of two independent project components. The first beneficiary is the&#13;
Tuoketuo Electric Power Generation Company (TEPGC). TEPGC will be responsible&#13;
for the construction and operation of the first phase of the Tuoketuo coal-fired power&#13;
plant (2x600 MW) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The second beneficiary&#13;
is NCPGC. NCPGC will be responsible for the rehabilitation and reinforcement of the&#13;
T&amp;D system in Beijing.&#13;
A. LEGAL STATUS AND ORGANIZATION OF THE BENEFICIARIES&#13;
3.2   TEPGC. TEPGC is a newly formed limited liability company established in May&#13;
1996 by three shareholders, including NCPGC, the Inner Mongolia Electric Power&#13;
Company (IMEPC) and the Beijing International Electric Power Development&#13;
Investment Company (BIEPDIC). Its registered capital is Y 2 billion. NCPGC holds 51&#13;
percent of the shares, IMEPC 34 percent and BIEPDIC 15 percent.&#13;
3.3   The Articles of Association (dated May 3, 1996) empower TEPGC to build and&#13;
operate the Tuoketuo power plant to improve the power supply in the Jing-Jin-Tang area,&#13;
especially Beijing Municipality. They also require the company "to continuously&#13;
increase the economic profits and obtain higher returns for the shareholders." Under&#13;
existing Chinese laws, TEPGC can raise funds from various sources, issue stocks and&#13;
bonds and enter joint-venture agreements with foreign companies. However, these&#13;
activities are still regulated and government approval are required at various levels.&#13;
TEPGC has the authority to receive part of the proceeds of the proposed World Bank loan&#13;
through the Central Government, to carry out the construction and the management of the&#13;
power plant, and to enter into a Project Agreement with the World Bank.&#13;
3.4   TEPGC is headed by a General Manager assisted by one to four Deputy General&#13;
Managers and a Financial Officer. The organizational structure of TEPGC is shown in&#13;
Chart 2.  TEPGC is currently assuming full responsibility for preparation and&#13;
implementation of the project.  Initially, the Tuoketuo Power Plant Preparatory&#13;
Department had been established with the responsibility for preparation of the power&#13;
station component of the project. The staff in the Preparatory Department in IMEPC&#13;
have been transferred to TEPGC and continue to perform their previous functions. The&#13;
organization and proposed staffing of TEPGC are suitable for building and managing&#13;
large thermal power plants. A total staff complement of 588 staff is planned-459&#13;
operations staff and 128 managerial and administrative staff.  During the initial&#13;
construction phase, about 80 managerial and administrative staff would be required, of&#13;
which 50 would be retained when the plant is commissioned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
3.5   The Articles of Association also provide for the establishment of a Board of&#13;
Directors to represent the interests of the shareholders, appoint and dismiss the general&#13;
manager and high-level staff and supervise the management of the Company. Members&#13;
of the Board are appointed by the shareholders.&#13;
3.6   NCPGC. NCPGC is one of the largest companies in China with an asset base of&#13;
about Y 23 billion. It has 47 wholly-owned subsidiary enterprises, 55 enterprises with a&#13;
controlling interest and 29 enterprises with a minority stake. NCPGC runs and operates&#13;
North China Power Grid. It supplies power to an area of 1.47 million square kilometers,&#13;
covering Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi and West Inner Mongolia. NCPGC owns 62&#13;
power stations, 4 survey and design institutes, 19 power construction companies, 5 test&#13;
and research organizations and 11 manufacturing and repairing enterprises.&#13;
3.7   NCPGC is an independent legal entity possessing the status of a limited liability&#13;
company. Its charter has been formulated under the law on industrial enterprises, and the&#13;
State Council's regulation on "the Structural Reformation of the North China Power&#13;
Network." NCPGC's legal status and Charter require revision to conform with the 1994&#13;
Company Law following issuance of guidelines for restructuring state-owned enterprises&#13;
as companies (Article 21, Chapter 2 of the Company Law).&#13;
3.8   NCPGC is headed by a President assisted by six Vice Presidents, a Chief&#13;
Engineer and a Chief Economist. The organizational structure is shown in Chart 3. The&#13;
functions of NCPGC are outlined in its existing charter. These include construction of&#13;
power projects and raising funds from various sources. In practice, NCPGC obtains&#13;
investment funds from state and central government and through borrowing from policy&#13;
and local banks. NCPGC has also corporate power to issue bonds and shares with the&#13;
approval of relevant authorities. It has the authority to receive part of the proceeds of the&#13;
proposed World Bank loan through the Central Government, to carry out the proposed&#13;
T&amp;D component, and to enter into a Project Agreement with the World Bank.&#13;
3.9   Following the approval of the proposed project, NCPGC intends to transfer its 51&#13;
percent shareholding in TEPGC to the Beijing Datang Power Generation Company&#13;
Limited (BDP). BDP is a joint stock limited company incorporated in China with limited&#13;
liability (see Box 3.1 for more details). On March 21, 1997, BDP completed a "H" Share&#13;
Offer comprising: (a) a public offering of 2.5 percent of the registered capital in the&#13;
Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange; (b) a private placement of&#13;
22.5 percent of the registered capital to professional and institutional investors worldwide&#13;
by selective marketing in different markets.' The transfer of NCPGC's equity share in&#13;
TEPGC to BDP has been approved in principle by MOEP. Formal approval of the&#13;
relevant Chinese authorities is now being sought. Following approval by the Chinese&#13;
authorities, the transfer will be discussed formally with the Bank. It is expected that&#13;
Given the success of the offering, the Share Offer has been increased from 25 to 27.7 percent of the&#13;
registered capital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
TEPGC would continue to remain a fully independent limited liability company. BDP&#13;
plans to use a portion of the proceeds of the "H" Share Offering to finance its equity in&#13;
TEPGC.&#13;
Box 3.1: BEIJING DATANG POWER GENERATION COMPANY LIMITED&#13;
The Beijing Datang Power Generation Company (BDP) is a joint stock limited company&#13;
incorporated in China with limited liability. The Company was established in December, 1994 by NCPGC&#13;
to develop, construct, own and operate coal-fired electric power plants within the NCPGC service area.&#13;
BDP currently owns and operates 3,150 MW of power generation capacity, making it one of the&#13;
largest independent power producers in China. BDP plans to develop, either solely or with other investors,&#13;
several additional plants with an aggregate planned installed capacity of 4,500 MW by the year 2002.&#13;
BDP's effective interest in this additional planned capacity (i.e., the aggregate of the capacity of each plant&#13;
multipled by BDP's percentage interest in each plant) is anticipated to be 2,532 MW.&#13;
On March 21, 1997, BDP successfully completed a public and private offering of 25 percent of its&#13;
registered capital. This comprised 1,244,060,000 H Shares with a nominal value of Y 1.00 each. Each&#13;
share was priced at HK$2.52 per share, which was payable at full on application. Of the total share&#13;
offering, 10 percent was listed publicly on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange,&#13;
and the remaining 90 percent placed with private institutional and professional investors worldwide by the&#13;
Underwriters to the issue. Given the success of the offering, the Share Offer has been increased from 25 to&#13;
27.7 percent of the registered capital.&#13;

B. PLANNING, BUDGET AND CONTROL&#13;
3.10  Power bureaus and companies are responsible for developing annual and five-year&#13;
production and investment plans, which are integrated into the national plans and are&#13;
approved, through MOEP's auspices, by SPC. In the past, financial planning was&#13;
confined to attaching monetary values, predetermined by MOEP, to the power production&#13;
being planned. Although a power bureau's plan might be revised to reflect changes, it&#13;
would ordinarily not be revised to reflect differences between estimated prices and actual&#13;
prices. However, with the economic changes in the 1980s, prices have begun to move&#13;
toward market levels and the Government now finances investments through loans rather&#13;
than grants. Centralized control is being relaxed and replaced by greater financial&#13;
autonomy and responsibilities for the power entities. To address these changes, both&#13;
TEPGC and NCPGC will need to design and implement modem financial planning and&#13;
management systems.&#13;
3.11  MOEP recognizes the importance of financial management in the power sector in&#13;
China and is promoting relevant training programs for all the power institutions under its&#13;
control. Many of the power bureaus/companies, including NCPGC, have been equipped&#13;
with personal computers and software for planning, budgeting, and accounting functions.&#13;
Information from the bureaus/companies can be transferred to MOEP and consolidated&#13;
into regional and national data.&#13;
3.12  These systems represent a good first generation of automated management&#13;
information; however, they still are not sufficient and integrated as a network to promptly&#13;
provide financial and related statistical information about a power entity's operations to&#13;
the various management levels, supplying each level with the necessary details at the&#13;
appropriate times. TEPGC and NCPGC also need to introduce accounting and financial&#13;
management systems that will: (a) enable managers to be held accountable for costs of&#13;
activities and functions over which they have control; (b) provide information for&#13;
comparative analysis of actual costs with budgets for decision-making; and (c) provide&#13;
transparency of information for investors, government, lenders, and the public in general.&#13;
The proposed project includes a technical assistance component to support TEPGC and&#13;
NCPGC in establishing appropriate systems and procedures to upgrade their budgeting&#13;
and financial accounting systems, including provision of software and hardware, as well&#13;
as enhancement of their staff skills. The terms of reference (TOR) for the proposed&#13;
studies under this project are presented in Annex 3.1 for TEPGC and in Annex 3.2 for&#13;
NCPGC. Assurances were obtainedfrom TEPGC and NCPGC during negotiations that&#13;
they will: (a) carry out the organizational restructuring and financial management&#13;
systems studies according to the schedule agreed with the Bank; and (b) implement the&#13;
recommended organizational improvements, and accounting and financial management&#13;
systems, taking into account Bank comments.&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1   The proposed project is intended to:&#13;
(a)   increase electricity supply and electricity trade in North China through&#13;
creation of an independent power company to develop a mine-mouth&#13;
power plant in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region that will supply the&#13;
Jing-Jin-Tang grid through long-term contractual arrangements;&#13;
(b)   improve the efficiency of energy supply and use in the region by:&#13;

4.3   The achievement of the objectives would be tracked and monitored through&#13;
specific measurable targets.  Project implementation in terms of construction and&#13;
commissioning would be monitored as actual physical output or percentage of project&#13;
completion (power generated, number of trees planted, etc.), achievement of efficiency&#13;
and quality of supply goals (availability, supply interruptions, system losses), and&#13;
improvement of management and advances in power sector reform (financial targets,&#13;
diversification of financing sources). These are presented in Section K (Reporting and&#13;
Monitoring).&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.4   The project consists of two major components. The first and largest component is&#13;
the Tuoketuo thermal power plant and associated technical assistance. The second is the&#13;
Beijing T&amp;D component. The respective beneficiaries are TEPGC and NCPGC.&#13;
Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant Component&#13;
4.5   The first component, under the responsibility of TEPGC, will include:&#13;
(a)   construction of the first two 600 MW coal-fired subcritical thermal units in&#13;
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as the first phase of the Tuoketuo&#13;
power station. These units will be equipped with on-line performance&#13;
monitoring systems to minimize coal consumption and gradually introduce&#13;
advanced maintenance techniques;&#13;
(b)   technical assistance to TEPGC for: (i) design and introduction of modern&#13;
accounting and financial management systems; (ii) construction&#13;
management and engineering services; (iii) environmental management&#13;
and monitoring; (iv) use of simulator and computerized systems to&#13;
develop operational staff capabilities in plant operation and management;&#13;
and (v) implementation of a plan for assets divestiture and involvement of&#13;
private investors in existing and new power projects in Inner Mongolia&#13;
(see para. 4.15); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(c)   a desertification control and dryland management program to improve the&#13;
environmental conditions in Tuoketuo county.&#13;
4.6   The two generation units to be constructed under the proposed Tuoketuo thermal&#13;
power plant component consist of subcritical, drum-type boilers with low nitrogen oxide&#13;
(NOJ) burners, single-shaft condensing turbines and 600 MW generators. They share a&#13;
single 240 m stack. The plant's design coal is a blend of screened unwashed bituminous&#13;
coal with a calorific value of 4,300+500 kcal/kg, ash content of 26+4 percent and sulfur&#13;
content of 0.47 percent.  Emissions of particulates are minimized by electrostatic&#13;
precipitators with an efficiency of 99.76. The plant will also include an on-line&#13;
monitoring system to maximize efficiency and reduce coal consumption and provide&#13;
useful data for preventive maintenance (see Annex 4.1).&#13;
4.7   To transmit the electricity generated by the Tuoketuo thermal power plant to the&#13;
JJTPG grid, three 500 kV transmission lines and associated sub- and switching stations&#13;
will be constructed under a separate project that does not involve World Bank funding&#13;
(see Annex 4.1). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NCPGC will&#13;
complete the 500 kV transmission lines and associated sub- and switching stations three&#13;
months prior to the commissioning of the first 600 MW unit of the Tuoketuo Thermal&#13;
Power Plant.&#13;
Beijing T&amp;D Component&#13;
4.8   This second component, under the responsibility of NCPGC, will include:&#13;
(a)   construction of two 220 kV  indoor substations at Xibianmen and&#13;
Xizhimen respectively. Xibianmen will be equipped with two 250 MVA,&#13;
220/110/10 kV transformers and Xizhimen with two 200 MVA, 220/110/&#13;
10 kV transformers;&#13;
(b)   addition of a third 250 MVA  220/110/10 kV  transformer in the&#13;
underground Wangfujing substation, currently under construction; and&#13;
(c)   technical assistance to NCPGC for implementing accounting and financial&#13;
management systems.&#13;
In connection with, and to complement, this project, NCPGC will undertake the&#13;
following program, approved separately and financed locally.&#13;
(a)   Replacement of overloaded and inefficient units in the Beicheng and&#13;
Huichengmen substations by four 50 MVA 110/10 kV transformers; and&#13;
(b)   upgrading of the distribution system in the heavily loaded, high-growth&#13;
Xizhimen area. The upgrading will involve reconductoring of insulated&#13;
overhead lines (approximately 75 km), and installation of five compact&#13;
10 kV transformer stations.&#13;
A detailed description is shown in Annex 4.2.&#13;

Project Design and Consulting Services&#13;
4.9   The Tuoketuo thermal power project feasibility study and design report were&#13;
completed by the North China Electric Power Design Institute (NCEPDI) in 1993, and&#13;
revised in June 1996. The project was approved by SPC in 1994. Following the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines, international engineering consultants were selected to assist in finalizing&#13;
designs, procurement of goods, engineering and design interface coordination and limited&#13;
construction supervision. Funding in the amount of $2.4 million out of the China&#13;
Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestment Project [CRISPP (Credit 2447-CHA)]&#13;
has been provided for this purpose. The scope of the construction management and&#13;
supervision component will be broadened under the proposed project according to the&#13;
TOR provided in Annex 4.3. A first version of the Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
Report (EIAR) was prepared in 1994 by NCEPDI. The report was revised with the&#13;
assistance of international consultants to conform with the Chinese and Bank&#13;
environmental procedures and guidelines for thermal power projects and finalized in May&#13;
1996. The EIAR has been approved by all Government authorities, and its summary was&#13;
distributed to the Executive Directors on May 28, 1996. The overall project concept and&#13;
design is satisfactory.&#13;
4.10 For the Beijing T&amp;D component, designs, including load flows, fault level, and&#13;
stability studies, have been carried out by NCEPDI. NCEPDI has extensive experience in&#13;
the successful design of T&amp;D systems as well as of other power infrastructure facilities.&#13;
The concept and design of the transmission facilities and the pilot project of distribution&#13;
rehabilitation to reduce losses is satisfactory.  Assistance is being provided by&#13;
international consultants through a Beijing T&amp;D efficiency improvement study funded&#13;
under a Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant (see para. 4.32).&#13;
C. SECTOR REFORMS&#13;
4.11  One of the objectives of the proposed project is to assist and facilitate the power&#13;
sector reform process in the North China region. It will advance the power sector reform&#13;
process in two main areas: (a) development of contractual arrangements between TEPGC&#13;
(the Seller) and NCPGC (the Purchaser) that will be based on efficient commercial and&#13;
economic terms; and (b) assistance for divestiture of existing assets and/or involvement&#13;
of domestic or foreign private investors to raise additional capital for power system&#13;
expansion.&#13;
Contractual Arrangements&#13;
4.12  The project will provide technical assistance in establishing TEPGC, the first&#13;
independent power producer on the NCPGC system, as a financially autonomous and&#13;
commercially oriented enterprise. The assistance includes development of a detailed&#13;
power purchase agreement and dispatch rules that will govern the business relationships&#13;
between TEPGC (the seller) and NCPGC (the purchaser). Once the concept of an&#13;
independent generating enterprise has been successfully demonstrated, privately owned&#13;
facilities will be more easily accepted. The power purchase agreement developed under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
the proposed project and signed on December 31, 1996 is a major step toward full&#13;
commercialization and business orientation of the power sector in China.  Future&#13;
agreements with other nonutility and privately owned producers as well will build on the&#13;
progress achieved.&#13;
4.13  The PPA reflects the principles agreed with the World Bank as a part of the&#13;
continuing dialogue on power sector reform in China. The most innovative legal features&#13;
of the PPA for a Chinese power project are: (a) risks are allocated based on widely&#13;
accepted financing and commercial practices; and (b) explicit definition of government&#13;
change-of-law and policy events with provision of legal recourse and protection for both&#13;
the seller and the purchaser. From an economic efficiency perspective, a two-part tariff&#13;
has been defined for the first time in a Chinese power sales contract with: (a) a capacity&#13;
charge covering debt and a minimum equity return if the plant meets minimum contracted&#13;
availability; (b) a capacity charge weighted to provide higher payments for peak&#13;
availability; (c) an energy charge reflecting only fuel and other variable costs-there is no&#13;
minimum energy generation (or take-or-pay) obligation, ensuring economic dispatch of&#13;
the facility; and (d) incentives built into the capacity charge to reduce overall scheduled&#13;
and unscheduled outage time for higher returns.&#13;
4.14 The project will also demonstrate the viability of the purchasing agency model,&#13;
which is becoming the standard approach to unbundling generation and transmission in&#13;
many other countries. The regional grid will purchase electricity from various generators&#13;
and sell to the distribution entities at prices that reflect the overall cost of supply. In&#13;
subsequent stages, the functions of the regional grid company would eventually be&#13;
limited to purchase of power from independent producers and other power generation&#13;
companies, ownership and operation of the transmission system (including dispatch), and&#13;
sale of power to the provincial utilities.&#13;
Assets Divestiture&#13;
4.15  During project processing, IMEPC prepared, with the assistance of international&#13;
consultants funded by Canadian Trust Funds, a plan aimed at increasing private and&#13;
nonutility investment in the Inner Mongolia Generation System. IMEPC's divestiture&#13;
plan includes: (a) additional equity offering of 15 million shares of Inner Mongolia&#13;
Mendian Huaneng Thermal Power Company in Shanghai (about Y 4/share is expected by&#13;
the underwriter for shares with a face value of Y 1/share) by mid-1997; (b) establishing a&#13;
limited liability company to support the sale of the Wulashan coal-fired power plant&#13;
(200 MW) to an independent Chinese operator by the end of 1997; and (c) involving&#13;
private investor(s) in further expansion and development of the Haibowan Electric Power&#13;
Company (2xlO0 MW  installed and 2x200 MW  under development).  Technical&#13;
assistance will be provided under the proposed project to carry out preparatory work to&#13;
implement IMEPC's plans for divestiture and involvement of private investors in existing&#13;
and new projects (see Annex 4.4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
4.16  In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the project has been&#13;
assigned to Category A. The Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared with&#13;
assistance of an international consultant specializing in environmental issues related to&#13;
thermal power plants, and has been approved by the Inner Mongolia Environmental&#13;
Protection Agency (IMEPA), and the National Environmental Protection Agency&#13;
(NEPA). The EA has been reviewed by the World Bank; it is considered that all&#13;
environmental aspects of the project are satisfactorily addressed with respect to all&#13;
Chinese and World Bank environmental regulations, policies, and procedures. The&#13;
project has been designed and will be implemented in accordance with modern concepts&#13;
of environmental management. Consequently, the project should cause minimum&#13;
disturbance to the environment. An environmental management unit (EMU) will be&#13;
established by the company (see Annex 4.5 for EMU TOR) and a consultant engaged to&#13;
assist in defining and operationalizing the EMU work program (see AnnexA4.6) for&#13;
Consultant TOR). An environmental monitoring program will be incorporated to&#13;
ascertain and verify these conditions on a sustained basis.&#13;
4.17  The project is a greenfield operation, located within the boundary of Yanshanying&#13;
a small village in a rural area of Tuoketuo County. The site is approximately 70 km&#13;
southwest of Huhhot City, the provincial capital of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.&#13;
Three alternative locations for the power plant were considered.  All three were&#13;
satisfactory from an environmental perspective. The selected site was closest to the ash&#13;
disposal site with the most favorable geological conditions, was most convenient to&#13;
infrastructure (drainage, water supply, transportation facilities, etc.) and offered the best&#13;
natural geologic foundation for plant construction.&#13;
4.18  Modern pollution control technologies will be incorporated into the design of the&#13;
power plant, such as high-efficiency electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) and low NO,&#13;
burners. In addition, the plant layout provides adequate space to install additional&#13;
pollution control systems (e.g., flue gas desulfurization) if required, as a result of future&#13;
changes in Chinese emission standards and/or technological developments permit.&#13;
Annex 4.7. Part A provides a summary of key environmental issues associated with the&#13;
project, their anticipated potential impacts, the mitigation plan to assure these potential&#13;
impacts are minimized, the monitoring program with which actual environmental impacts&#13;
will be measured, compared with EA predictions and, if necessary, indicate further&#13;
actions to be taken. As mentioned above, further strengthening of TEPGC with respect to&#13;
environmental management capabilities will be included in the project, with the creation&#13;
of the EMU, acquisition of appropriate environmental monitoring equipment, and the&#13;
establishing of an automated environmental data management system (see Annex 4.7e&#13;
Parts B. C. and D). In addition, since it is anticipated that the power plant will act as a&#13;
nucleus for further economic development in the region, technical assistance (training,&#13;
both locally and abroad) will be provided through TEPGC to the environmental&#13;
protection bureaus (EPBs) of Inner Mongolia, Huhhot, and Tuoketuo so that they can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
prepare an air quality management plan to ensure healthy air quality levels are preserved&#13;
in the region.&#13;
4.19  Environmental issues associated with the project (power station, transmission line,&#13;
railway connection and cooling water supply system) and addressed in the EA included&#13;
all concerns expressed by affected peoples in a series of public meetings. The local&#13;
population and the local authorities support the project and the mitigating measures&#13;
recommended in the EA. The technical assistance programs, mitigation and monitoring&#13;
programs presented in Annex 4.7 will be fully implemented.&#13;
4.20  Key issues addressed in the EA included: air pollution, (dust, SO2), noise, water&#13;
pollution (groundwater at the ash disposal site, and surface water contamination of the&#13;
Yellow River), electric field strength, bird flight patterns (transmission lines), industrial&#13;
hazards and worker safety, desertification control, and impacts of both construction and&#13;
operation labor forces on the local infrastructure and social structure. The distribution&#13;
system component is mostly rehabilitation and reinforcement of existing lines and&#13;
substations, and will not adversely impact the environment. Public safety will be&#13;
improved. No polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) will be utilized in the substations to be&#13;
financed, and bidding documents will note this restriction accordingly. MOEP provided&#13;
certification that the transformers that are to be replaced under the T&amp;D component do&#13;
not contain PCBs (banned in China from the early 1970s). In addition, the proposed&#13;
project (two units of 600 MW each) is the first phase of an overall program to develop&#13;
3,600 MW at the Tuoketuo site. To anticipate any future adverse environmental&#13;
consequences, the EA examined both the immediate impacts of the proposed project&#13;
(1,200 MW), as well as cumulative impacts of the 3,600 MW program.&#13;
4.21  All mitigating measures (for air, water, solids, noise, electric field, etc.)&#13;
incorporated in the project are designed to meet appropriate Chinese requirements and/or&#13;
World Bank guidelines, whichever is stricter. In the absence of either, international&#13;
standards or codes of practice will be used. Assurances were obtained at negotiations&#13;
that TEPGC will carry out the Environment Action Plan in a manner satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank. In addition, a soil conservation and desertification control subcomponent of the&#13;
project would contribute to the revegetation effort currently planned (see Annex 4.8).&#13;
The plan calls for the arrest of desertification through soil conservation techniques,&#13;
establishment of vegetative cover to combat wind erosion, and improvement of soil&#13;
microclimate, water retention and nutrient properties. The overall target for Tuoketuo&#13;
County is to establish a 40 percent forest cover. Local people will be employed in the&#13;
revegetation effort, with preference given to oustees.&#13;
E. RESETTLEMENT&#13;
4.22  The project design focused on minimizing the scope of resettlement. Where land&#13;
acquisition and demolition of existing housing are unavoidable, the Resettlement Action&#13;
Plans (RAPs) are proposed to ensure: (a) improvement of the standard of living of the&#13;
Project-Affected Persons (PAPs); (b) compensation of the villages for land and PAPs for&#13;
their lost assets at replacement values without depreciation; (d) compensation for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
disrupted infrastructure; and (e) establishment of adequate mechanisms for grievance and&#13;
appeals, and systems for internal independent monitoring. Both project components&#13;
involve land acquisition and/or relocation of population. Costs of land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement are estimated at Y 296.5 million for both components (see Annex4.92).&#13;
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) have been prepared to comply with appropriate&#13;
Chinese policies and/or World Bank guidelines (OD 4.30). Assurances were obtained&#13;
that the Borrower would ensure that the persons affected by the project are resettled in&#13;
accordance with the resettlement plans agreed with the Beneficiaries.&#13;
Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant&#13;
4.23  The plant requires: (a) acquisition of about 836 ha of land, of which 55.6 percent&#13;
is cultivated, and (b) demolition of about of 3,340 m  of old houses with poor access to&#13;
basic infrastructure and sanitation facilities. It will affect about 2,253 persons. RAPs&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank have been prepared for all subcomponents for which detailed&#13;
designs are already complete (power plant and ash disposal site). Future resettlement&#13;
activities related to the railway connection and the cooling water supply system (water&#13;
pumping station and pipeline) will be undertaken more than two years later. The designs&#13;
for these two subcomponents are being carried out by the Zhungeer Coal Industry&#13;
Company and the Yellow River Hydraulic and Water Resource Administration&#13;
Committee. The components are linked to broader development of the Zhungeer Coal&#13;
Mine-Fengzhen railway project and the management of the Yellow River. The RAPs for&#13;
these components will be prepared by mid-1997 following the completion of the design&#13;
of the railway connection and the cooling water supply system.&#13;
4.24  Arrangements for relocation, prepared in collaboration with local authorities and&#13;
the population affected by the project, are in line with Chinese national and provincial&#13;
policies. Special attention was given to the most vulnerable groups (households headed&#13;
by women, senior people and poorest households). The new village is within 300 meters&#13;
of the existing village, and 250 meters of the Huhhot-Zhungeer highway. All new houses&#13;
will be built of bricks and wood and are of higher quality than the old ones. New public&#13;
facilities will be provided in the new village such as a clinic, school, shopping and&#13;
cultural centers. Displaced farmers will continue their agricultural activities in the newly&#13;
reclaimed agricultural lands in new irrigation areas. Four motor-pumped wells will be&#13;
installed for irrigation purposes. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that TEPGC&#13;
will (a) carry out the resettlement program for the Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant and&#13;
ash disposal site in accordance with the agreed resettlement plan; and (b) prepare a RAP&#13;
for the railway connection and the cooling water supply system by September 30, 1997&#13;
and carry out the resettlement program as agreed with the Bank.&#13;
4.25  A Project Resettlement Office with six staff members has been established in&#13;
TEPGC to oversee the management and implementation of resettlement program. It will&#13;
be assisted by Tuoketuo County Resettlement Office and Yanshanying Township&#13;
Resettlement Office. Two senior members of the office have received training on&#13;
involuntary resettlement sponsored by MOF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Beijing T&amp;D&#13;
4.26 Xibianmen substation requires acquisition of 6,100 mn of land, demolition of 239&#13;
houses, and relocation of 935 persons. However, this program is part of a wider planned&#13;
program of urban renovation and development of Beijing under the responsibility of the&#13;
Beijing Municipal Construction Development Corporation (BMCDC). The majority of&#13;
residential houses to be demolished are old and hazardous with poor sanitation facilities.&#13;
There is no resettlement need for Wangfujing and Xizhimen because the former is an&#13;
underground substation under construction and the latter will be built using the site of the&#13;
existing 110 kV substation. The pilot project of distribution rehabilitation involves&#13;
mainly reconductoring and installation of compact transformers and capacitors and does&#13;
not require any resettlement. Households displaced by the Xibianmen substation will be&#13;
relocated in new apartment buildings with modem facilities in a close-by residential&#13;
areas. Assurances were obtained that NCPGC will carry out resettlement under the&#13;
Beijing T&amp;D component according to the agreed resettlement plan.&#13;
4.27  A Project Resettlement Office has been established to oversee the resettlement&#13;
work related to Xibianmen substation. It consists of representatives from Beijing&#13;
Municipal Power Supply Company (BMPSC), which is a division of NCPGC, BMCDC,&#13;
the Government of Xicheng District, and Beijing Municipality.&#13;
Implementation Monitoring&#13;
4.28 TEPGC and NCPGC respectively contracted the Inner Mongolia Academy of&#13;
Social Science (IMASS) and the Beijing Social and Psychological Research Institute&#13;
(BSPRI) to monitor the resettlement activities and provide an independent evaluation of&#13;
resettlement. The monitoring and evaluation will be based on a sample of 10 to 15&#13;
percent of affected population. The objective of monitoring and evaluation is to ensure&#13;
that the resettlement program is implemented smoothly and that living conditions and&#13;
income of resettlers are fully restored.&#13;
F. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.29 TEPGC will be responsible for implementation and operation of the Tuoketuo&#13;
thermal power plant component. Its organizational structure is shown in Chart 2.&#13;
Preparatory works including access roads and construction power supply started in&#13;
October 1996 and have been progressing satisfactorily. The bidding documents for the&#13;
procurement of the main boiler and turbine-generator packages were issued in April 1997&#13;
and are scheduled to be opened in September 1997. The commercial operation of the first&#13;
generating unit is expected in October 2001 and the second unit in September 2002.&#13;
Thus, the project completion date would be January 2004 and the closing date of the&#13;
Bank loan would be July 31, 2004. Chart 4 presents the implementation schedule for the&#13;
power plant. Furthermore, key dates of project implementation are given in Annex 4.10.&#13;
4.30 NCPGC will be responsible for execution of the Beijing T&amp;D component&#13;
including construction, commissioning and operation. NCPGC has had substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
experience in power generation, T&amp;D, and has been operating the North China Power&#13;
Grid since 1987. Beijing Power Supply Design Institute (BPSDI) and NCEPDI will&#13;
undertake preparation of technical bidding documents, bids evaluation, detailed&#13;
construction design and supply of drawings for, respectively, Xizhimen and Wangfujing&#13;
and Xibianmen.  BPSDI and NCEPDI have both design experience in 220 kV&#13;
substations. Construction of the works will be the responsibility of the construction&#13;
department of BMPSC. The construction department also has extensive experience in the&#13;
relevant area. The bidding documents for the items to be procured under ICB packages&#13;
are scheduled to be issued in June 1997. Completion of the T&amp;D component is planned&#13;
for August 1999. Key dates for implementation are given in Annex 4.10 and the&#13;
component implementation schedule is given in Chart 5.&#13;
Management Development and Training&#13;
4.31  To meet TEPGC's long-term staffing requirements and to further develop&#13;
TEPGC's management capability, a comprehensive technical assistance and training&#13;
program  is included under the proposed project.  It consists of the following:&#13;
(a) technical assistance to implement accounting and financial management systems (see&#13;
para. 3.12 and Annex 3.1); (b) training in utility management and financial planning;&#13;
(c) project-related training for technical staff; and (d) upgrading of and equipment for&#13;
TEPGC's training facilities. It is planned that all the technical staff will be trained in&#13;
various fields, totaling 1,325 staff-months of training in China and abroad (see Annex&#13;
4.11). Assurances were obtained from TEPGC that it will carry out the management&#13;
development and training program as agreed with the Bank.&#13;
4.32 NCPGC's planning and management capability will be strengthened through&#13;
training and studies. A technical assistance program is included to assist NCPGC to&#13;
implement accounting and financial management systems (see para. 3.12 and Annex 3.2).&#13;
A Beijing T&amp;D efficiency improvement study is being carried out to develop a program&#13;
of investments and other measures that would reduce power losses on the Beijing T&amp;D&#13;
systems to economic levels and ensure acceptable quality and reliability of power&#13;
supplies to end-consumers. The study is funded through a PHRD grant for an amount of&#13;
$960,000. The study will strengthen NCPGC's planning capability through technology&#13;
transfer and on-the-job training in advanced planning methodology and provision of&#13;
hardware and software for transmission and distribution system analyses.&#13;
G. COST ESTIMATE&#13;
4.33  The total cost of the project is estimated at $1,103.6 million equivalent, excluding&#13;
interest during construction (IDC), including both the Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant&#13;
($954.8 million) and the Beijing T&amp;D component ($148.8 million), of which $500.0&#13;
million (45.3 percent) represents the foreign exchange component. Table 4.1 provides a&#13;
summary of the estimated project cost. The cost estimates reflect mid-1996 prices and&#13;
are based on the recent tendering information available for similar projects, including&#13;
prices for major generating equipment and control systems. Physical contingencies are&#13;
calculated at 10 percent for civil works and locally supplied equipment and 5 percent for&#13;
&#13;

percent for 2004. The price escalation for costs expressed in local currency is calculated&#13;
according to projected local inflation rates (in percent) of 10 for 1996, 8 for 1997, 7 for&#13;

1998, 6.5 for 1999 and thereafter. The prevailing exchange rate during preappraisal&#13;
(Y 8.3257=$1) is used in the cost estimates.&#13;
H. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.34 The total financing requirements (including IDC of $187.2 million equivalent) are&#13;
estimated at $1,290.8 million equivalent. The financing plan for the overall project is&#13;
shown in Table 4.2. The financing required for the Tuoketuo thermal power plant&#13;
component is estimated at $1,108.4 million equivalent, including IDC of $153.6 million&#13;
equivalent. The local costs estimated at $524.8 million equivalent, IDC for both local&#13;
and foreign loans estimated at $153.6 million equivalent and working capital estimated at&#13;
$6.0 million equivalent will be provided by equity contribution and local borrowings&#13;
raised by the three shareholders. Their equity contribution is estimated at $277.2 million&#13;
equivalent, representing 25 percent of the total cost of the component. The remaining&#13;
financing requirements of about $401.2 million equivalent will be covered through bond&#13;
issues and borrowings by the three shareholders proportionally to their respective shares&#13;
in TEPGC, specifically, 51 percent by NCPGC, 34 percent by IMEPC, and 15 percent by&#13;
BIPDIC.&#13;
4.35  The foreign cost of the thermal power plant component, excluding IDC of $64.1&#13;
million, estimated at $430 million will be covered by the proposed Bank loan of $330&#13;
million and commercial cofinancing of about $100.0 million. The borrower of the&#13;
commercial cofinancing would be the People's Republic of China represented by MOF,&#13;
and the proceeds of the financing would be onlent to TEPGC under the same&#13;
arrangements as the Bank loan. It is expected that the central government, represented by&#13;
the Ministry of Finance, will seek amortized syndication loans with 15-year maturities&#13;
from commercial banks/insurance companies with a LIBOR-based floating interest rate to&#13;
better match the project's cash flow.  The Government gave assurances that the&#13;
commercial cofinancing will be in place in December 1998. It is expected that provision&#13;
of an optional cross-default clause by the Bank would be sufficient to secure adequate&#13;
loan terms. However, if required by market conditions, the Bank would consider&#13;
provision of a credit guarantee to extend maturity and lower the cost of commercial&#13;
borrowings by China. The Bank would then require a Government counterindemnity&#13;
against covered risks and would charge a guarantee fee of 0.25 percent per year of the&#13;
Bank exposure under the guarantee. Such a guarantee operation, if required, would be&#13;
submitted to the Board for approval on a stand-alone basis.&#13;
4.36 The financing required for the Beijing T&amp;D component is estimated at $182.4&#13;
million equivalent, including IDC of $33.6 million equivalent. The proposed Bank loan&#13;
of $70 million will finance the foreign cost of the investment. The local costs estimated&#13;
at $78.8 million equivalent and the IDC for both foreign and local loans of $33.6 million&#13;
equivalent will be covered by self-financing from NCPGC and loans from SDB, Beijing&#13;
Municipality, and Hebei Province.&#13;

4.37 The proposed Bank loan of $400 million will be made to the People's Republic of&#13;
China at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency&#13;
loans, with a maturity of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. Proceeds of the loan&#13;
would be onlent from the Government to TEPGC and NCPGC on the same terms and&#13;
conditions as the Bank loan. TEDGC and NCPGC will bear the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
TEPGC and NCPGC have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan terms&#13;
for the project to: (a) facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of their&#13;
borrowing by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities with that of their net&#13;
trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar denominated; and (b) preserve the&#13;
full maturity of the loan and the lower annuity payment in early years. The fixed-rate&#13;
option would have resulted in a 15-year loan and higher annual payments during the&#13;
initial operational period.&#13;
4.38  Assurances were obtainedfrom the Government that it would onlend the proceeds&#13;
of the proposed Bank loan to TEPGC and NCPGC under subsidiary loan agreements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
with a term of 20 years, including 5-year grace period, at a variable rate equal to the&#13;
Bank rate. TEPGC and NCPGC will bear the foreign exchange risk. Execution of the&#13;
subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and both TEPGC and NCPGC,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank and approval of the Loan Agreement by the State Council would&#13;
be conditions of loan effectiveness.&#13;
I. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.39 Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3 and the related&#13;
procurement schedules for various packages are given in Annex 4.12. The Bank's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines (published in January 1995 and revised in January and August&#13;
1996) will be applied to all Bank-financed procurement. The Bank loan will be largely&#13;
disbursed against major plant equipment, boiler and turbine-generator packages and part&#13;
of the T&amp;D equipment and materials through international competitive bidding (ICB).&#13;
Other procurement packages, such as instrumentation and control, 500 kV electrical&#13;
equipment, ash-handling equipment, etc., will be funded by commercial bank/insurance&#13;
company loans. For procurement of goods not financed by the Bank, the Borrower may&#13;
adopt other procurement procedures. In such cases, the Bank shall be satisfied that the&#13;
procedures fulfill the Borrower's obligations to cause the project to be carried out&#13;
diligently and efficiently. Prequalification of bidders is not required because the&#13;
equipment to be procured under the project is "quasi-standardized" (i.e., the technical&#13;
specifications are clearly specified and all potential suppliers are familiar with the&#13;
Chinese market). Postqualification of bidders will be based on criteria set out in the&#13;
bidding documents. Some specialized equipment estimated to cost less than $300,000&#13;
per contract up to an aggregate amount of $6 million for the thermal power plant&#13;
component and $1.2 million for the Beijing T&amp;D component and which can only be&#13;
purchased from a limited number of suppliers, regardless of the cost thereof, will be&#13;
procured through limited international bidding (LIB).  Goods, instruments and&#13;
accessories needed for construction and operation of the power plant, including&#13;
equipment for environmental monitoring and training, which are readily available off-the-&#13;
shelf or are standard specification commodities, and which are estimated to cost less than&#13;
$300,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of $2.5 million for the thermal power&#13;
plant component and $600,000 for the Beijing T&amp;D component, will be procured through&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of (a) international shopping procedures for up to an&#13;
aggregate amount not to exceed $2 million for the thermal power component and&#13;
$400,000 for the T&amp;D component, or (b) national shopping procedures for up to an&#13;
aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000 for the thermal power plant component and&#13;
$200,000 for the Beijing T&amp;D component. Goods of a proprietary nature may be&#13;
procured through direct contracting with the Bank's prior agreement up to an aggregate&#13;
amount not to exceed $500,000 for the thermal power plant component and $200,000 for&#13;
the Beijing T&amp;D component.&#13;

4.40  Five contracts amounting to about $7.3 million in total for consulting services for&#13;
the two components will be awarded in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Use of&#13;
Consultants (August 1981). These include: engineering consultant for construction&#13;
management (one contract); organizational restructuring and financial management&#13;
systems (two contracts); consulting services for environmental aspects (one contract); and&#13;
legal and financial services for asset divestiture. For complex, time-based assignments,&#13;
such contracts shall be based on the standard form of contract for consultants' services&#13;
issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as shall have been agreed by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
4.41  In ICB procurement, model bidding documents developed in consultation with the&#13;
Bank would be used. Standard bid evaluation forms for procurement of Goods and&#13;
Works (April 1996) would be used. Qualified domestic manufacturers would be eligible&#13;
for a margin of preference of 15 percent of the CIF price or the actual customs duty,&#13;
whichever is lower, in the evaluation of bids.&#13;
4.42  Because of foreign exchange limitations, civil works (fully locally financed) and&#13;
non-Bank-financed equipment will be procured locally through competitive bidding&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank. The procurement procedures for non-Bank-financed&#13;
components will not adversely affect the execution of the project in terms of cost, quality&#13;
or completion time.&#13;
4.43  Prior review would apply to all Bank-financed contracts for goods, with an&#13;
estimated cost of $5 million equivalent or above (about 94 percent of the loan). Other&#13;
contracts would be subject to selective postaward review. Prior review would also be&#13;
required for all consultancy contracts with an estimated cost exceeding $50,000 for&#13;
individuals, or $100,000 for firms. Exceptions to prior review would not apply to the&#13;
TOR for all consultancy contracts and single-source selection of consulting firms.&#13;
4.44  The invitation to prequalify or bid for each contract estimated to cost $10,000,000&#13;
equivalent or more shall be advertised in accordance with the procedures applicable to&#13;
large contracts under para. 2.8 of the Guidelines.&#13;
J. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.45  The Bank loan will be disbursed against:  (a) 100 percent of the foreign&#13;
expenditures for directly imported equipment and materials quoted on a CIF basis;&#13;
(b) 100 percent of local expenditures ex-factory for locally manufactured items, and 75&#13;
percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; and (c) 100 percent of the&#13;
expenditure for consulting services and training. For expenditures pertaining to goods&#13;
contracts valued at less than $5,000,000 (except for the first three such contracts),&#13;
consultancy contracts valued at less than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals&#13;
and all training, reimbursement will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures.&#13;
Supporting documents need not be submitted to the Bank but will be retained in&#13;
TEPGC's and NCPGC's office for review by Bank supervision missions. To facilitate&#13;
disbursements under this project, a Special Account will be established for each&#13;

- 36 -&#13;
Beneficiary with an authorized allocation of $15 million for TEPGC and $8 million for&#13;
NCPGC, representing approximately four months of average project disbursements.&#13;
Applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly or when the amounts&#13;
withdrawn equal 50 percent of the initial deposit, whichever comes sooner. Annex 4.13&#13;
presents the disbursement schedule for the proposed  Bank  loan  as well as a standard&#13;
profile of disbursements for power sector in China. The disbursements are expected to be&#13;
completed in six years for the power plant and three years for the T&amp;D component, very&#13;
close to the standard disbursement profile for the power sector in China. The last year is&#13;
for payment of retention money. The annual estimated contractual and other payments&#13;

K. REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
4.46  Understandings were reached at appraisal concerning procedures and satisfactory&#13;
performance indicators for monitoring and reporting.  Reporting would include&#13;
semiannual project implementation reports covering all project components. A rolling&#13;
financial plan would also be submitted annually. The scope and content of the project&#13;
progress reports have also been agreed. The Bank supervision plan attached in Annex&#13;
4.14 will focus on the core activities of project implementation and achievement of&#13;
agreed objectives. The Key Project Performance Indicators are described in Annex 4.15.&#13;
4.47  With regard to the construction of the Tuoketuo power plant, monitoring of costs,&#13;
quality and schedule is the main function of TEPGC and their consultants during the&#13;
coming years. The Bank will monitor procurement progress in accordance with the&#13;
procurement schedule in Annex 4.12, and construction progress in accordance with the&#13;
schedule of Charts 4 and 5 and key dates presented in Annex 4. 10. Overall costs will be&#13;
monitored in accordance with Table 4.1. The guiding principles and implementation&#13;
indicators for the resettlement are or will be described in the RAPs submitted to the Bank&#13;
or covenanted under the proposed project.  The responsibility for environmental&#13;
monitoring is comprehensively presented in Annex 4.7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
5.1   TEPGC is a newly created corporation. In the medium term, its activities will be&#13;
dominated by the construction and subsequent operation of the proposed project.&#13;
TEPGC's operation and finances are interrelated with those of NCPGC; sole purchaser of&#13;
all power generated by the proposed two units. Both TEPGC and NCPGC follow MOF&#13;
financial regulations applicable to state-owned enterprises.&#13;
5.2   The financial regulations promulgated by MOF have gradually evolved over the&#13;
last decade from a system in which all investment funds were provided by the&#13;
Government and all surpluses remitted to it, to one which provides some autonomy and&#13;
incentives for efficiency. Overall, the new accounting principles effective July 1, 1993&#13;
are generally consistent with international accounting standards and financial rules. They&#13;
will, together with the rationalization of state assets management, and other fiscal and&#13;
financial sector reforms, further increase the accountability of the management of power&#13;
entities.&#13;
5.3   The Government promulgated a series of important tax laws at the end of 1993.&#13;
An unified corporate income tax rate of 33 percent is being applied to all domestic&#13;
enterprises. A new 17 percent value-added tax (VAT) replaced the old 25 percent sales&#13;
tax for power generation and distribution. The new tax policy is more transparent and&#13;
eliminates the lengthy and complicated negotiations between enterprises and the&#13;
Government. It is also conducive to better planning and financial management in the&#13;
power companies.&#13;
5.4   One of the Government's sectoral objectives is to strengthen the enterprises'&#13;
financial management so that the power companies could perform their increased&#13;
financial role effectively. Toward this end, the proposed project would focus on the&#13;
institutional building aspect and include (a) technical assistance to develop and improve&#13;
the accounting and financial management systems of both beneficiaries (para. 3.11); and&#13;
(b) agreements with TEPGC and NCPGC on financial performance targets to ensure&#13;
disciplined and sound financial management (paras. 5.7 and 5.15).&#13;
B. TEPGC's FINANCES&#13;
5.5   As TEPGC is a new company and has very few activities, the past financial&#13;
performance of the three sponsors, including NCPGC, IMEPC, and BIEPDIC, were&#13;
reviewed and found satisfactory. The review was focused on the cash flow situation of&#13;
each entity in order to assess the availability of funds to finance the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Financial Performance Targets&#13;
5.6   The self-financing ratio used in other power projects in China is not adequate to&#13;
monitor TEPGC's financial performance. TEPGC is an independent (nonutility) power&#13;
producer, and unlike power utilities, its activities do not require regular investments.&#13;
Moreover, development of subsequent phases may take time and could involve other&#13;
domestic and/or foreign investors. Therefore, a rate of return on equity has been selected&#13;
because it is a performance indicator commonly recognized in financial markets and&#13;
widely used by the power industry. Moreover, it is consistent with the tariff fornula set&#13;
in the power purchase agreement signed by TEPGC and NCPGC.&#13;
5.7   With a view to promoting prudent financial management, assurances were&#13;
obtained from TEPGC that it would:&#13;
(a)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff&#13;
adjustments, to earn an annual return on equity (defined as the total&#13;
unimpaired paid-in captial) of not less than 20 percent in 2003 and&#13;
thereafter;&#13;
(b)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff&#13;
adjustments, to ensure its internal cash generation would provide a debt&#13;
service coverage ratio of no less than 1.3 times during 2001-03, and 1.5&#13;
times thereafter; and&#13;
(c)   by April 30 of each year, furnish to the Bank a rolling eight-yearfinancial&#13;
plan containing projected income statements, sources and uses of funds,&#13;
and balance sheets.&#13;
Future Finances&#13;
5.8   As noted above (para. 4.12), a power purchase agreement has been signed&#13;
between TEPGC and NCPGC, which provides for a rate of return of 15 percent on equity&#13;
investment after the distribution of net income for 30 percent of principal repayment and&#13;
allocation of 15 percent for two funds during the first 10 years' operation and 20 percent&#13;
during the remaining years to ensure TEPGC's financial viability. Based on the&#13;
assumptions detailed in Annex 5.2, including electricity tariff setting that would allow&#13;
TEPGC to achieve the above financial performance targets, projections of TEPGC's&#13;
finances for the period 2001-2008 are presented in Annex 5.1. Salient features of&#13;
TEPGC's future finances are highlighted in Table 5.1.&#13;
5.9   Revenue Position. The first unit is scheduled to be commissioned in 2001 and&#13;
the second unit in 2002. The two units would become fully operational on a commercial&#13;
basis in 2003. The financial forecast indicated that the average tariff would be about 35.8&#13;
fen/kWh in 2001 (24.05 fen in end-1995 prices), which confirms the competitiveness of&#13;
the Tuoketuo Power Plant. The consequent cash generation is projected to be sufficient&#13;
to cover the debt service requirements. During the first eight years of its operations, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
average tariff that would allow TEPGC to achieve the agreed financial performance&#13;
targets and meet the required net income distribution is estimated at 47.8 fen/kWh in&#13;
current terms and 25.6 fen/kWh in 1995 prices.&#13;

5.10   TEPGC's Board of Directors decided to staff and operate the proposed power&#13;
plant according to international standards and best commercial practices to minimize&#13;
operating expenses. TEPGC is therefore expected to have a low operating ratio, which&#13;
will not exceed 48.2 percent during its first eight years of operation (2001-08). Its&#13;
average rates of return on historically valued and revalued net fixed assets, projected at&#13;
8.8  and  6.9  percent respectively, are  also  satisfactory.   However, debt service&#13;
requirements would be substantial. Specifically, debt service is forecast to account for an&#13;
average of 66 percent of TEPGC's operating income during the first eight years of&#13;
operation.&#13;
5.11    Funds Flow. During the project implementation period (1996-2002), TEPGC's&#13;
financing plan would be dominated by the proposed project. After commissioning of the&#13;
project, TEPGC is expected to generate substantial internal cash. As NCPGC would be&#13;
the sole customer and is expected to maintain a sound liquidity position (para. 5.22), no&#13;
problem is envisaged regarding collection of payments. However, as noted above, the&#13;
corporation would have a heavy debt service burden. The projected minimum tariff&#13;
requirements are mainly determined by the agreed debt service coverage ratio during&#13;
2003-08.&#13;
5.12    Capital Structure.  As required by the rule recently set by SPC  for all new&#13;
companies, three sponsors will invest equity shares equivalent to 25 percent of the project&#13;
investment cost in TEPGC. Within the first eight years of project operation, TEPGC's&#13;
capital structure is expected to improve considerably through retention of earnings and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
loan repayments. During the same period, its debt/equity ratio is forecast to improve&#13;
from a peak of 71/29 in 2001 to 43/57 in the year 2008.&#13;

5.14 NCPGC's financial performance in the past was generally satisfactory. During&#13;
the period 1993-95, NCPGC reported very modest profits with both net profitability on&#13;
equity and assets basis in the range of 2 to 3 percent. NCPGC's operating revenue&#13;
increased by 41 percent from 1993 to 1995 due to higher average tariff and energy sales.&#13;
However, its operating expenses increased even faster at a rate of 43 percent over the&#13;
same period as a result of over 60 percent increase of all operating expenses, except fuel&#13;
expenditures (8.5 percent). NCPGC has maintained a relatively conservative capital&#13;
structure with debt not exceeding 60 percent of total debt and equity over years. Its&#13;
liquidity position has been rather comfortable at levels over 1.5 in the past three years.&#13;
However, NCPGC's current tariff level is below the long-run marginal cost.&#13;
Financial Performance Targets&#13;
5.15  To promote prudent and sound financial management and adequate tariffs,&#13;
assurances were obtainedfrom NCPGC that it would:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
(a)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff&#13;
adjustments, to ensure its internal cash generation would provide a debt&#13;
service coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 times at all times;&#13;
(b)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff&#13;
adjustments, to earn an annual return on equity of not less than 8 percent&#13;
in 1998, 10 percent in 1999-2000, and 12 percent thereafter, and&#13;
(c)   by April 30 of each year, furnish to the Bank a rolling eight-year financial&#13;
plan containing projected income statements, statements of sources and&#13;
uses offunds, and balance sheets.&#13;
5.16  Achievement of these objectives will require substantial tariff increases.&#13;
Projections, presented in Table 5.3, show that NCPGC's average price must increase by a&#13;
minimum of about 16.7 percent (over 9.2 percent in real terms) per year from 1995 to&#13;
2001 so as to achieve a rate of return on equity of 12 percent.&#13;
Future Finances&#13;
5.17  The projections of NCPGC's finances for 1996-2003 are presented in Annex 5.4,&#13;
and the salient features of these finances are highlighted below in Table 5.3. The&#13;
projections are based on the assumptions contained in Annex 5.5.&#13;
5.18  Table 5.3 shows the projected price increases of purchased power, NCPGC's self-&#13;
generated power, and the weighted average of those two that will be required to meet the&#13;
financial covenants. The prices for purchased power will be determined on a plant-by-&#13;
plant basis, at "debt service price" levels, allowing for full debt service based on a seven&#13;
to eight-year payback period after commissioning of new power plants.&#13;
5.19  NCPGC's financial position, however, depends mostly on revenues that it collects&#13;
from its self-generated power. In order to meet the expansion plan and projected cost&#13;
increases in the future and comply with the financial performance targets set forth above,&#13;
NCPGC' s average sale price will need to increase by an estimated 15.2 percent in current&#13;
terms or 7.9 percent in real terms a year from 1995 to 2003. Given the current low&#13;
catalog prices, 20.4 fen/kWh in 1995, the average price of NCPGC's self-generated&#13;
power needs to triple over the period.&#13;
5.20  Although the rates of increase in the catalog prices needed for NCPGC are large,&#13;
much of the increase should stem from the entry of new generating plant into the rate&#13;
base. Because of the rapid load growth, the bulk of the tariff increase required will be&#13;
met through implementation of the new pricing principles. At the end of 1996, more than&#13;
half of NCPGC's own generation came from plants built since 1993.&#13;

5.21   During the period 1996-2003, NCPGC needs to maintain relatively high rates of&#13;
growth to meet the electricity demand required by the sustained strong economic growth&#13;
in the North China region. Based on the latest demand forecast and expansion plan&#13;
assumptions, energy sales are expected to rise by 85.1 percent over 1995 levels,&#13;
representing an average annual growth rate of about 8 percent. NCPGC's annual&#13;
investment program and net fixed assets in operation are expected to increase by 5.0- and&#13;
4.5-fold over the period, an annual increase of about 25 and 24 percent, respectively.&#13;
5.22   From 1996 on, NCPGC's performance is anticipated to improve gradually and&#13;
steadily as the tariff level of NCPGC's own generation is increased to meet the financial&#13;
targets, from 23 fen/kWh in 1995 to 83.3 fen/kWh in 2003 and tariff structure is further&#13;
rationalized. The debt service requirement emerges as an important determinant of future&#13;
price levels. Based on the projected minimum tariff level, about 17.5 percent increase per&#13;
year for its own generation and 10.8 percent for purchased power from 1995 to 2003,&#13;
both revenues and net income are expected to grow considerably over the period.&#13;
NCPGC is also expected to maintain a sound liquidity position with an average current&#13;
ratio of 1.42 over the projection period. The rate of return on historically valued assets&#13;
and on revalued assets will improve considerably during 1996-2003.&#13;
D. AUDIT&#13;
5.23   Under the proposed project, both TEPGC and NCPGC's accounts will be audited&#13;
by the Foreign Investment Audit Bureau of the State Audit Administration (SAA). This&#13;
arrangement is satisfactory. Assurances were obtained from TEPGC and NCPGC that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
they would (a) maintain and provide to the Bank semiannual progress reports with&#13;
unaudited project accounts to reflect project expenditures for the period under report&#13;
compared with the original project cost estimates; (b) furnish the Bank with the audited&#13;
accounts for the project, statements of expenditures, andfinancial statements of TEPGC&#13;
and NCPGC within six months of the end of each fiscal year; (c) implement any changes&#13;
to its accounting practices as recommended by their financial management consultants to&#13;
meet international accounting standards; and (d) require their auditors to comply with&#13;
international auditing practices and provide audit plans prior to each audit. For the first&#13;
audit report, the auditors are expected to provide: (a) a summary of the effects of&#13;
accounting changes arising from the adoption of new MOF regulations and corrections of&#13;
any deviations from MOF regulations as interpreted with reference to international&#13;
accounting standards and practices; and (b) a management letter summarizing any&#13;
significant matters that may have arisen during the conduct of the audit.&#13;

6.1   The Jing-Jin-Tang area is very important and fast growing industrial and&#13;
commercial base in China. However, it has limited electricity generation potential with&#13;
very limited hydroelectric and coal resources. During the last decade, it relied mostly on&#13;
imported coal from Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia for its power generation.&#13;
However, because of environmental concerns, scarcity of adequate generation sites and&#13;
overload of the railway system, NCPGC started importing power from mine-mouth&#13;
power plants in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi Province to meet the surging demand in the&#13;
Jing-Jin-Tang area.&#13;
6.2   During the preparation of the project, a least-cost expansion study was carried out&#13;
by the Beijing Economic Research Institute for Water Resources and Electric Power&#13;
(referred to as BERI), covering 1998-2025 (study period) with a focus on 1998-2010&#13;
(planning period).  The study was carried out using an optimization model that&#13;
determines the optimal capacity and generation mix to meet the demand with the&#13;
minimum cost (net present value of investment and operating costs), given a&#13;
predetermined reliability criteria. It considered all potential candidates including: power&#13;
imports from different coal-fired power plants in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi Province&#13;
(300 and 600 MW units), 300 MW distillate fueled combined cycle units, 300 and 600&#13;
MW coal-fired units in the Jing-Jin-Tang area, hydropower and pumped storage plants,&#13;
and gas turbines (100 MW units). Considering economic costs for all candidates&#13;
(including transmission costs in case of electricity transfer) and a discount rate of 12&#13;
percent, the study showed that the expansion program should, up to the year 2010, be&#13;
based mostly on 300 MW and 600 MW subcritical coal-fired units (preferably in Inner&#13;
Mongolia Autonomous Region or Shanxi Province) for base load and gas turbines and&#13;
pumped storage plants for peak load 2 The proposed project is the first investment of the&#13;
optimal (least-cost) power development program.&#13;
6.3   Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the proposed project, which&#13;
remains the first investment of the expansion program under a wide range of&#13;
assumptions:&#13;
2 Introduction of this highly automated and sophisticated technology in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous&#13;
Region is considered an unacceptable risk by the Beneficiary (and the Chinese Government). However,&#13;
the least-cost study showed that supercritical units are less economically attractive because of the low&#13;
economic coal price in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(a)   The project will still be required by year 2001-02, even if the demand&#13;
growth would slow from the projected 9 percent per year to only 6 percent&#13;
during 1995-2000, and from about 8 percent per year to 5.5 percent during&#13;
2000-2005;&#13;
(b)   The project would be less economical than an equivalent combined cycle&#13;
power plant only if the cost of distillate were more than 70 percent lower&#13;
than in the base case ($40 per ton of coal equivalent, $1.5 per MBtu,&#13;
compared to $141 per ton of coal equivalent, $5.2 per MBtu). Distillate&#13;
has been considered because of nonavailability of gas in North China in&#13;
the foreseeable future; and&#13;
(c)   The project remains the first investment of the least-cost program and is&#13;
still needed in 2001-02 even if the discount rate is increased from 12 to 14&#13;
percent.&#13;
6.4   The balances between power demand and supply are presented in Annex 6.1.&#13;
They demonstrate that the power system will be short of energy supply up to the year&#13;
2005.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return&#13;
6.5   The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the proposed project was&#13;
calculated based on the estimated plant gate power price of 33 fen/kWh (in 1995 prices)&#13;
in 2001, the first year of operation. This estimate is based on prices paid to the newest&#13;
baseload power plants selling power to NCPGC in 1995, according to existing policies&#13;
for pricing of power output from new power plants. It yielded an IERR of about 18.9&#13;
percent. This IERR, based on revenues generated by the new power plant rather than the&#13;
economic value of a shortfall in electric power supply, underestimates the economic&#13;
benefits of the project.&#13;
6.6   The IERR would decrease to the test discount rate of 12 percent, in the case of&#13;
one of the following occurrences:&#13;
(a)   the price paid at the plant gate for electricity were about 28 percent lower&#13;
than the base case price: i.e., 24 fen/kWh instead of 33 fen/kWh in 1995&#13;
prices;&#13;
(b)   the project were to experience a cost overrun of about 55 percent;&#13;
(c)   the power plant operation were reduced to about 4,200 hours per year&#13;
instead of about 6,000 hours;&#13;
(d)   the economic fuel cost were 140 percent higher than the base case;&#13;

(e)   the project were to experience a delay in commissioning of more than&#13;
three years.&#13;
6.7   However, these occurrences are very unlikely because China has a very good&#13;
record in project implementation, the economic assumptions considered in the base case&#13;
are conservative, and the power purchase agreement and the financial covenants of the&#13;
project would ensure that prices are high enough to meet the economic viability&#13;
requirements.&#13;
Environmental Benefits&#13;
6.8   BERI also conducted an economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the&#13;
project based on the "Benefits Transfer Method." It used: (a) the New York Externality&#13;
Model (Rowe et al., 1994) to determine adjusted estimate of the monetary damages&#13;
caused by air pollution during the study period, taking into account the location of the&#13;
power plant, the emission level and the population affected, and (b) estimates of average&#13;
annual climate change for carbon emissions to evaluate the monetary damages caused by&#13;
greenhouse gas emissions.&#13;
6.9   The results of the study showed that if the economic cost of the environmental&#13;
impacts is added to the project costs, the IERR would be reduced by 2.3 percent, 16.6&#13;
percent instead of 18.9 percent in the base case. It also confirmed that the economic cost&#13;
of the environmental impacts of the proposed project is lower than the economic cost of&#13;
the environmental impacts of a comparable power plant in the Jing-Jin-Tang area. If the&#13;
cost differential is added to the benefits of the proposed project, the IERR would increase&#13;
to 19.7 percent.&#13;
Project Risk&#13;
6.10  To complement the above deterministic analysis, risk analyses have been&#13;
performed using a probabilistic approach to assess the impact of the perceived risk factors&#13;
that affect the return of the project.&#13;
6.11  Four broad categories of risk have been considered in the analysis:&#13;
(a)   Demand Risk. Demand risk is related to lower load growth than expected&#13;
and/or breach of contract by the purchaser. Demand risk is not perceived&#13;
as a major risk factor in the short term with energy shortages prevailing in&#13;
the Jing-Jin-Tang grid. However, a low-load growth and/or an important&#13;
reduction in electricity off take could jeopardize the economic viability of&#13;
the project.&#13;
(b)   Price Risk. Price risk is related to the willingness and ability of the power&#13;
purchaser to pay and/or changes in pricing policy. This risk is normally&#13;
mitigated or managed through long-term contractual arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
However, experience shows that the seller could still be confronted to&#13;
unexpected price changes.&#13;
(c)    Cost Risk.  Higher-than-estimated project cost usually results from:&#13;
(i)higher equipment prices.  The major equipment and facilities of&#13;
generation will be purchased through international competitive bidding.&#13;
Prices could therefore be affected by market fluctuations; (ii) construction&#13;
cost overrun. Cost overrun during construction period is a common&#13;
phenomenon for many infrastructure projects. They are caused by a&#13;
number of factors, in particular, delay of construction due to interfacing&#13;
problems between different suppliers, unforeseen site conditions and&#13;
inadequate construction management; and (iii) coal prices. Coal prices&#13;
increase would result in a major operating cost increase of the power plant.&#13;
It is likely that the coal price would stay stable in the initial years.&#13;
However, it is possible that at later stages of the project lifetime there&#13;
might be a coal price increase due to more stringent environmental&#13;
constraints (higher price for better quality coal, requirement to wash the&#13;
lower quality coal, etc.).&#13;
(d)    Operational Performance Risk. Poor operational performance could be&#13;
caused by:  (i) low  quality of generating equipment and facilities,&#13;
(ii) below standard coal, and (iii) inadequate maintenance and poor&#13;
management.&#13;
6.12   Based on the foregoing considerations and extensive sensitivity analyses, five&#13;
variables have been selected as the crucial risk variables because of their significant&#13;
impact on the project economic viability. Table 6.2 presents the selected variables, the&#13;
assumed value ranges and the probability distributions attached to them based on past&#13;
Bank experience in power projects in general and China in particular.&#13;
6.13   The risk analysis was carried out with the Risk Master computer software, which&#13;
uses Monte Carlo simulation3 technique. The spreadsheet employed for the risk analysis&#13;
is based on the base case cost/benefit analysis (see Table 6.1). The correlation between&#13;
risk variables is explicitly considered prior to the simulation to avoid generation of&#13;
unrealistic project scenarios. For instance, variations of output and cost are correlated&#13;
with the construction lead time.&#13;
6.14 The results, based on 1,000 simulations, are summarized in Table 6.3 and Figure&#13;
6.1.&#13;
3 Monte Carlo simulation works by generating a series of random numbers following the distribution of&#13;
probability of each risk variable. For each simulation which represents a combination of different state&#13;
of 5 variables, IERR is calculated and recorded. The results of 1,000 simulations are averaged.&#13;

6.15   The expected IERR, based on the weighted average of all simulated combinations&#13;
is 17.91 percent (with a standard deviation of 2.40 percent), 1 percent lower than the base&#13;
case value without consideration of project risks. The minimum and maximum IERR,&#13;
under the considered uncertainties, are respectively 11.03 and 26.24 percent. The&#13;
probability of a negative outcome (negative net present value) is zero. And finally, the&#13;
probability for the IERR to be below the considered discount rate is negligible.&#13;
6.16   All the above analyses clearly show that the project is robust under future&#13;
uncertainties and that the risk (margin of error) associated with it is acceptable. The&#13;
potential risks associated with power plant construction, cost overruns, and&#13;
implementation delays have been addressed through advanced procurement actions,&#13;
timely staffing and training of personnel of TEPGC, and the assistance provided by&#13;
highly experienced international engineering consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COMPONENT&#13;
6.17  Operation records and load flow/short circuit analyses of the Beijing transmission&#13;
and distribution networks show that a number of 220 kV and 110 kV substations and&#13;
lines were overloaded and/or exceeding their rated fault levels in supplying the existing&#13;
demand. This causes a major safety and reliability concern in operating the entire North&#13;
China Power Grid. In January 1995, Beijing experienced a major blackout due to limited&#13;
transformation capacity in existing substations and limitation of the load transit capacity.&#13;
In the area where the new 220 kV substations are proposed, three out of five existing&#13;
110 kV substations were loaded at 92, 98 and 104 percent of their respective rated&#13;
capacity in 1995. The existing system is saturated and require major reinforcements to&#13;
adequately service the current load and supply any additional demand.&#13;
6.18  The proposed transmission upgrading plans were selected after thorough technical&#13;
analyses by NCEPDI and NCPGC. They represent the minimum requirements to avoid&#13;
further deterioration and ensure supply with acceptable standards of quality. A least-cost&#13;
analysis of this component was undertaken by BERI. Two major alternatives that are the&#13;
only feasible supply options were investigated:  (a) the first alternative (proposed&#13;
component) is based on introduction of two more injection points at the 220 kV level&#13;
closer to the city center (the Xibianmen and Xizhimen substations) to supply a number of&#13;
110 kV substations that are either existing or under construction, and (b) the second&#13;
alternative is based on continued expansion of the existing 110 kV transmission systems&#13;
by adding new 110 kV substations and lines. Considering the same incremental demand,&#13;
the cost stream for each alternative, over a project life of 30 years (economic investment&#13;
costs, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs as 2 percent of the capital investment&#13;
costs, and the estimated cost of losses based on the long-run marginal cost of supply), and&#13;
a 12 percent discount rate, the computed net present value of the costs of first alternative&#13;
is about $23 million, 17 percent, lower than that of the second alternative. This is a&#13;
conservative estimate because the cost of land and right-of-way, which is higher in the&#13;
second alternative, was not included.&#13;
6.19  Cost/benefit analysis of the component was carried out using the economic costs&#13;
and the incremental sales revenue as minimum benefits. The costs include: (a) capital&#13;
investments under the project, (b) investment costs at 110 kV and below to support the&#13;
demand growth, (c) the incremental O&amp;M costs calculated at 2 percent of the capital&#13;
costs, (d) expenses for incremental power purchase (including 5 percent for power plant&#13;
use and 5 percent for transmission losses) valued at the system long-run marginal cost.&#13;
The power sales price considered for evaluating the incremental benefits is the current&#13;
average tariff and, therefore, does not exceed consumers' minimum willingness to pay.&#13;
The 15.55 percent IERR yielded by this methodology could be considered as a minimum&#13;
rate of return on the proposed transmission component.  The project remains&#13;
economically viable even in case of cost increases of 10 (IERR of 14.25 percent) and 20&#13;
(IERR of 13.10 percent) percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6.20 Upgrading of the distribution system in the heavily loaded, high-growth Xizhimen&#13;
area is a pilot project as part of a large-scale urban distribution rehabilitation program that&#13;
is being developed in association with the transmission development plan. At present,&#13;
about 60 percent of distribution lines are overloaded and 36 percent of installed&#13;
distribution transformers in Beijing are high-loss transformers. The annual losses were&#13;
about 220 GWh.  The technical aspect including loss reduction measures were&#13;
investigated by NCPGC and the economic justification was undertaken by BERI. The&#13;
major benefits are seen as the reduced losses and increased supply. The benefits of&#13;
reduced losses were calculated using the average consumer price of the Beijing&#13;
Municipality Grid at the retail level and the benefits of the incremental sales were&#13;
measured as the difference between the current average retail tariff and the average&#13;
transfer price at the high-voltage level. This conservative approach, which does not&#13;
include the benefit of improved quality of supply, yielded an IERR of 29 percent for the&#13;
pilot project. Sensitivity analysis showed that if the capital costs would increase by 30&#13;
percent, the IERR would still be 25 percent.&#13;
C. SUSTAINABILITY AND RISK OF THE PROJECT&#13;
6.21  Financial sustainability of the major project component is ensured by the PPA&#13;
developed by and signed between TEPGC and NCPGC prior to project negotiations and&#13;
suitable financial project covenants. The market for the power is guaranteed and NCPGC&#13;
will have no major problems in fulfilling its obligations under the PPA, even in the case&#13;
of moderate growth. Suitable performance monitoring indicators have been developed&#13;
that will allow impending major problems to be detected and corrective measures taken if&#13;
necessary.&#13;
6.22  All proposed technologies are currently in successful use in China. Cost overrun&#13;
risks have been addressed by advanced procurement action; bids for major components&#13;
have already been prepared before loan negotiations and issued prior to Board&#13;
presentation. The risk of delay in project construction due to project management&#13;
shortcomings is minimal because of the experience gained during the implementation of&#13;
the Haibowan and Dalate projects (two large coal-fired power plant in Inner Mongolia&#13;
Autonomous Region), the timely staffing and training of personnel of the TEPGC and&#13;
NCPGC, and the assistance provided by experienced international engineering&#13;
consultants. The risk of nonperformance in the environmental and resettlement area has&#13;
been addressed by the establishment of appropriate monitoring organizations and&#13;
procedures.  More importantly, sensitivity analyses show that even in case of&#13;
implementation of more stringent environmental standards requiring future installation of&#13;
flue gas desulfurization (FGD), the project would remain economically viable.&#13;
6.23  Delay in implementing power sector reforms in an efficient and timely manner&#13;
represents a risk that can jeopardize the progress toward more openness and efficiency of&#13;
the sector and more fiscal and managerial autonomy of TEPGC and NCPGC. This risk is&#13;
minimized by the strong commitment of Chinese institutions to reform both at the central&#13;
and provincial level. This risk is also addressed through provision of required technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
assistance and adequate monitoring of implementation of the agreed upon reform plan&#13;
during the project cycle.&#13;
6.24 The economic and financial risks would be minimal. In view of advanced&#13;
preparatory works, risks associated with project construction, cost overruns, and&#13;
implementation delays are within reasonable limits and manageable with the agreed&#13;
supervision and involvement of competent consultants. Particular attention will be given&#13;
to the safety aspects of the project, and to capability and performance of major&#13;
contractors.&#13;
6.25  Risk analyses have been performed using a probabilistic approach to assess the&#13;
impact of the perceived risk factors that affect the return of the project. The risk analysis&#13;
was carried out with the Risk Master computer software, which uses Monte Carlo&#13;
simulation technique. The expected IERR, based on the weighted average of 1,000&#13;
simulated combinations is 17.91 percent (with a standard deviation of 2.40 percent),&#13;
1.00 percent lower than the base case value without consideration of project risks. The&#13;
minimum and maximum IERR, under the considered uncertainties, are respectively 11.03&#13;
and 26.24 percent. The probability of a negative outcome (negative net present value) is&#13;
zero. And finally, the probability for the IERR to be below the considered discount rate&#13;
is negligible.&#13;

ANNEX 3.1: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TEPGC&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING AND FINANCIAL&#13;
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS&#13;
A. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    Tuoketuo Electric Power Generating Company (TEPGC) is a Limited Liability&#13;
Company, founded in May 1996 by the North China Power Group Company (NCPGC),&#13;
Inner Mongolia Electric Power Company (IMEPC), and Beijing International Electric&#13;
Power Development Investment Company (BIEPDIC). Their respective ownership&#13;
shares are NCPGC 51 percent, IMEPC 34 percent, and BIEPDIC 15 percent of the&#13;
shares.&#13;
2.    TEPGC is one of the beneficiaries of the proposed World Bank loan to finance the&#13;
first phase of the Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant (2x600 MW units). The output from the&#13;
station is to be purchased by NCPGC and fed into the Jing-Jin-Tang grid, intended&#13;
specifically to satisfy the increasing demand in Beijing and its environs.&#13;
3.    The formation of TEPGC as an independent nonutility generator is a significant&#13;
organizational development in the Chinese power sector.  It represents a major&#13;
undertaking to meet the operational challenges of power sector reforms initiated by the&#13;
Chinese Govermnent. One of the major objectives of these reforms is to establish a&#13;
modem  enterprise system  characterized by clear definition of property rights,&#13;
autonomous management, commercial orientation, financial independence, and&#13;
separation of government ownership  and regulatory  functions from  enterprise&#13;
management.  The reforms are mainly based on:  (a) new accounting regulations,&#13;
promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and in effect since July 1, 1994, and (b) the&#13;
improved enterprise policy and governance framework defined by the Company Law&#13;
enacted in July 1994.&#13;
4.    To achieve these objectives, the Chinese Government and the World Bank jointly&#13;
developed an implementation program of sector reforms that stresses full corporatization&#13;
and greater autonomy and accountability of power enterprises.' The reform strategy is&#13;
intended to improve the operational efficiency and increase the market orientation of the&#13;
power sector.&#13;
5.    Like most state-owned enterprises, TEPGC is likely to be faced with the&#13;
following problems: (a) government interference in management, administrative and&#13;

-65 -                      ANNEX 3.1&#13;
operational decisions reflecting the former central planning orientation of the economy;&#13;
(b) lack of full accountability of managers stemming from an inadequate, highly&#13;
centralized decision-making and nonavailability of timely and accurate financial&#13;
information at different operational activity levels; and (c) lack of transparency of the&#13;
financial situation: financial statements may not provide full disclosure of TEPGC's&#13;
financial position.&#13;
6.    This technical assistance activity is financed through the Tuoketuo thermal power&#13;
project and is designed to address the above-mentioned organizational and financial&#13;
issues. It stresses the strengthening of internal organizational and management practices,&#13;
and the introduction of appropriate accounting, budgeting and financial management&#13;
systems. The technical assistance provides not only for consulting services but also&#13;
training of TEPGC's staff and managers in China and abroad to ensure successful&#13;
implementation of the study recommendations and developed systems. To achieve the&#13;
full benefits of organizational reform and improved financial reporting and monitoring&#13;
systems, it is proposed to carry out the project in three distinct but fully integrated phases:&#13;
Phase I: Preparation Phase&#13;
7.    Comprising a comprehensive review of the organizational structure, management&#13;
practices, and financial/accounting practices and reporting systems in TEPGC. Particular&#13;
attention would be paid to the division of responsibilities, flow of information and quality&#13;
of reporting, and budgeting and accounting systems and procedures.&#13;
Phase II: Development Phase&#13;
8.    Comprising the development of a suitable organizational structure, design of the&#13;
required accounting and financial and budgeting systems to meet the need of efficient&#13;
management and decentralized decision-making, and preparation of a detailed plan for&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Phase III: Implementation Phase&#13;
9.   Implementation of the organizational structure and financial systems approved by&#13;
TEPGC including computer, software and training needs.&#13;
B. SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
10.   The project will include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following tasks:&#13;
Phase I: Preparation Phase&#13;
11.   During the first phase, the consultants are required to carry out a detailed&#13;
assessment of the current organizational structure and financial management practices,&#13;
considering the experience of selected nonutility generation entities. The scope of this&#13;
review will include:&#13;
(a)   Internal organization, operating and administrative procedures with&#13;
particular attention to the responsibilities of the planned functional units&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66 -                      ANNEX 3.1&#13;
their relations. Aspects to be examined would be overlap in lines of&#13;
responsibility, excessive centralization of decision-making, and&#13;
organizational deficiencies;&#13;
(b)   Accounting procedures, documentation, reporting formats and the nature&#13;
of financial transactions between the various departments and units of&#13;
TEPGC;&#13;
(c)   Assessment of Cost Accounting, Financial Planning, Budgeting, and&#13;
Internal Audit systems and procedures;&#13;
(d)   Evaluation  of performance monitoring  systems: establishment of&#13;
performance targets and indicators, methods for communicating,&#13;
controlling and monitoring them.&#13;
Phase II: Development Phase&#13;
12.   During the second phase, the consultants will, jointly with TEPGC, develop an&#13;
organizational structure and related management, accounting, financial, control and&#13;
reporting systems that address TEPGC's specific requirements. Useful features of other&#13;
nonutility generating enterprise models in other countries and China will be incorporated.&#13;
The work in this phase is organized in three subactivities:&#13;
Organizational and Management Structure&#13;
13.   The consultants, jointly with TEPGC, will provide definitions of the functional&#13;
boundaries and responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the management of TEPGC&#13;
and the role of the President, Vice Presidents and their relationship with operational&#13;

ANNEX 3.2: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR NCPGC&#13;
ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS&#13;
A. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The North China Power Group Company (NCPGC) is one of the largest&#13;
companies in China. It has 47 wholly-owned subsidiary enterprises, 55 enterprises with a&#13;
controlling interest and 29 enterprises with a minority stake. NCPGC runs and operates&#13;
North China Power Grid. It supplies power to an area of 1.47 million square kilometers,&#13;
covering Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi and West Inner Monogolia.&#13;
2.    Like most state-owned enterprises, NCPGC is faced with the following problems:&#13;
(a) government interference in management, administrative and operational decisions,&#13;
reflecting the former central planning orientation of the economy; (b) lack of full&#13;
accountability of managers stemming from an inadequate, highly centralized decision-&#13;
making and nonavailability of timely and accurate financial information at different&#13;
operational activity levels; (c) lack of transparency of the financial situation: financial&#13;
statements that are now prepared based on the new accounting regulation effective July 1,&#13;
1993 still do not provide full disclosure of NCPGC's financial position as the&#13;
construction in progress is recorded separately; and (d) lack of focus on the core business&#13;
operations and involvement in many activities that include profitable activities such as&#13;
construction companies, design/engineering institutes, as well as welfare responsibilities&#13;
such as housing, school, hospitals, etc.&#13;
3.    NCPGC is undertaking major changes to meet the operational challenges of&#13;
power sector reforms initiated by the Chinese Government. One of the main objectives&#13;
of these reforms is to establish a modem enterprise system characterized by clear&#13;
definition of property rights, autonomous management, commercial orientation, financial&#13;
independence, and separation of government ownership and regulatory functions from&#13;
enterprise management. To achieve these objectives, the Chinese Government and the&#13;
World Bank jointly developed an implementation program of sector reforms that stresses&#13;
full corporatization and greater autonomy and accountability of power enterprises. The&#13;
reform strategy is intended to improve the operational efficiency and increase the market&#13;
orientation of the power sector.&#13;
4.    NCPGC is expected to receive a loan from the World Bank to finance the&#13;
Tuoketuo Thermal Power Project. The project includes consultancy services to assist&#13;
NCPGC in upgrading its accounting and financial management practices and systems and&#13;
developing modern, computerized accounting and financial information systems, which&#13;
will enable managers to obtain timely information on the costs of all aspects of the&#13;
company's activities. The new systems would facilitate better budgetary control and&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 4.1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION: TUOKETUO&#13;
THERMAL POWER PLANT COMPONENT&#13;
General&#13;
1.    The owner of the project is Tuoketuo Electric Power Generating Company&#13;
(TEPGC). The domestic designer is the North China Electric Power Design Institute&#13;
(NCEPDI). Two coal-fired turbo-generating units of 600 MW each will be installed in&#13;
the plant to be financed under a proposed World Bank loan. The ultimate capacity of the&#13;
plant will be 3,600 MW (6 x 600 MW). The target date of the completion of the first&#13;
phase (2x600 MW) is September 2002. After completion of the project, the plant will&#13;
supply electric power to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area in North China.  The&#13;
scheduled dates of commercial operation of the two units are as follows:&#13;
Unit 1 - October 2001&#13;
Unit 2 - September 2002&#13;
2.    The proposed Tuoketuo thermal power plant is located in a plain in Tuoketuo&#13;
County, about 70 km south of Huhhot City, the capital of Inner Mongolia Autonomous&#13;
Region, about 50 km northeast of Zhungeer Coal Mine and 7 km north of the Yellow&#13;
River. It has favorable geological conditions and easy access by railway and highway.&#13;
The power plant will be leveled above the once-for- 100-year flood line.&#13;
Coal&#13;
3.    Basic design parameters for the boilers and turbine generators are based on standard&#13;
specifications of 600 MW coal-fired subcritical units of proven technology. The power&#13;
plant will use up to 4.0 million tons per year and will be designed to bum a blend of&#13;
screened unwashed coal from the Zhungeer coal mines. The coal will be bituminous with&#13;
a calorific value of 4,300+500 kcal/kg, ash content of 26±4 percent and sulfur content of&#13;
0.47 percent. The Zhungeer coal will be transported to the power station by trains, using&#13;
electric locomotives. The rolling stock will be owned by the power station, but the lines&#13;
are the property of the mine except for a spur of about 45 km to be built and owned by the&#13;
station.&#13;
Cooling and Make-upWater System&#13;
4.    The source of cooling and make-up water required by the power plant (1.2 m3/sec&#13;
in summer peak for the 2x600 MW units) will be supplied from the Yellow River. A&#13;
closed circulating water system will be adopted. Each unit will be equipped with one&#13;
cooling tower and three circulating water pumps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

500 kV Transmission Lines and Associated Substations&#13;
5.    To transmit the electricity generated by the project to the JTTPG, three 500 kV&#13;
transmission lines and associated sub- and switching stations will be constructed under a&#13;
separate project that does not involve World Bank funding. One of these lines will run&#13;
from the Tuoketuo plant to the Anding substation in the suburbs of Beijing, a distance of&#13;
520 km. This line will pass through Yingxian, where a series capacitor compensation&#13;
station will be located. Another line, about 35 km in length, will connect the Tuoketuo&#13;
plant to the Yongshengyu switching station in Inner Mongolia. The third line (145 km)&#13;
will interconnect the Shunyi and Qianxi substations. The associated sub- and switching&#13;
stations include (a) the series capacitor compensation station in Yingxian; (b) the new&#13;
Yongshengyu switching station with three bays; (c) extension of the Anding substation&#13;
by one bay and installation of an additional 750 MVA transformer; and (d) the new&#13;
Qianxi substation in Beijing in which one 500 kV bay will be constructed and one&#13;
750 MVA transformer installed. The Shunyi-Qianxi line will also require an additional&#13;
bay in the Shunyi substation. Implementation of the transmission project will be&#13;
coordinated with the construction of the Tuoketuo generating station to ensure&#13;
completion of the new transmission infrastructure before trial operation of the generating&#13;
station begins. The total cost of the transmission lines and associated substations is&#13;
estimated to be Y 3,082 million (1995 prices), including compensation for land and&#13;
facilities acquisition. The environmental impact of these transmission lines is addressed&#13;
in Section 4.7 of the Tuoketuo environmental assessment report (EAR).&#13;
Turbines and Generators&#13;
6.    The two turbines will have a nominal rated output of 600 MW with subcritical'&#13;
steam pressure of 16.7 MPa at high-pressure turbine inlet and superheat and reheat&#13;
temperature of 538°C each unit will be equipped with one high-pressure turbine bypass&#13;
system and one low-pressure turbine bypass system.&#13;
7.    The turbine generators will have a nominal capacity of 600 MW  each at 22 kV.&#13;
The cooling mode is a water-hydrogen-hydrogen type. A static excitation system will be&#13;
adopted.&#13;
For 600 MW class thermal power plants, there are two alternative configurations, one with subcritical&#13;
and the other with supercritical steam conditions. For the Tuoketuo project, the units will be designed&#13;
to have standard subcritical steam conditions because of the following reasons:&#13;
&#149; The Tuoketuo power plant is a mine-mouth power plant. The subcritical plant is economically&#13;
justified because of relatively low fuel cost.&#13;
* The Tuoketuo power plant will be the first 600 MW class plant in the Inner Mongolia region.&#13;
(The largest existing plant in Inner Mongolia is the 330 MW Dalate power plant.) It is&#13;
premature to build a 600 MW supercritical unit in the Inner Mongolia Region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81-                     ANNEX 4.1&#13;
Steam Generators&#13;
8.    The steam generators will be of the subcritical,' single reheat, dry bottom ash,&#13;
balanced draft, drum type, each rated to MCR of 2,020 tons/hour, steam pressure of&#13;
18.18 MPa and steam temperature of 5410C at superheater and reheater outlets. Each&#13;
steam generator will be equipped with six medium-speed mills. When burning "design&#13;
coal," five mills will be operated with one stand-by. Two boilers will share a 240 m&#13;
chimney.  For air pollution mitigation, the design includes four-field electrostatic&#13;
precipitator with 99.76 percent efficiency, low NOx burners and other low NOx&#13;
technology. Provision has been made for space to install gas desulfurization equipment,&#13;
if required in the future by more stringent environmental standards.&#13;
Coal Handling System&#13;
9.    Coal will be transported by railway from the Zhungeer coal mines to the power&#13;
plant with self-discharge bottom-dump cars and slope-type coal wagons. The project&#13;
includes a coal storage yard with a capacity of about 128,400 tons, which is equivalent to&#13;
10 days' coal consumption of the two 600 MW units.&#13;
Ash Handling System&#13;
10.   The two first 600 MW units, built under the proposed project, will produce about&#13;
1.13 million tons of fly ash and 0.22 million tons of slag each year. The ash yard will be&#13;
located 2 km south of the plant and will have the capacity corresponding to ash and slag&#13;
disposal for 17 years. To facilitate the utilization of fly ash, the power plant will be&#13;
provided with coarse ash and fine ash storages. TEPGC plans to utilize about 30 percent&#13;
of the fly ash. The fly ash from the electrostatic precipitators and the bottom of&#13;
economizers of the two units will be conveyed pneumatically to a dry ash silo where the&#13;
dry ash will be moisturized to ease its handling and piling in the ash yard. Slag will be&#13;
crushed and sluiced hydraulically in intermittent cycles into the front basin of the ash and&#13;
slag pumphouse. The ash and slag will be transferred hydraulically by the ash/slag&#13;
pumps to the ash yard. A recirculation water system will be adopted to reduce water&#13;
consumption. The cooling tower blowdown water of 600 tons/hour is supplied to the&#13;
system to compensate the evaporation from the ash yard of 600 tons/hour.&#13;
Instrumentation and Control System&#13;
11.   A microprocessor-based distributed control system including data acquisition&#13;
system (DAS), supervisory control system (SCS), control coordination system (CCS),&#13;
furnace fire fighting system (FSSS), etc. will be provided. Display of plant-specific&#13;
equipment status and operating parameters on CRTs installed in the central control room&#13;
will provide real-time interface between operators and plant systems.  On-line&#13;
performance monitoring system will be provided to increase plant performance, reduce&#13;
coal consumption and gradually introduce innovative advanced maintenance techniques.&#13;

ANNEX 4.2: PROJECT DESCRIPTION: BEIJING&#13;
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION (T&amp;D) COMPONENT&#13;
General&#13;
1.    Beijing T&amp;D component is one of the two major components of the Tuoketuo&#13;
Thermal Power Project. The objective of the component is to reduce the constraints to&#13;
efficient transmission and distribution of power within the city of Beijing, particularly in&#13;
the densely populated, high load-growth areas around the city center.&#13;
2.   Investment in the transmission and distribution networks in Beijing over the last&#13;
decade have not kept pace with the increase in consumer demand. The Beijing Municipal&#13;
Electric Power Grid is therefore experiencing major operational problems: reduced&#13;
reliability of supply, overload of a number of major substations and lines, and high losses&#13;
in the system, especially in the city center. To ensure adequate supplies, it is necessary to&#13;
introduce more injection points at higher transmission voltages closer to the city center&#13;
and to upgrade the heavily loaded distribution system. These measures will improve&#13;
supply reliability, reduce losses and improve the quality of consumer service. The&#13;
component will achieve these objectives by providing new substations, installing reactive&#13;
compensation, increasing transformer capacities in substations and on distribution lines,&#13;
installing more efficient distribution transformers and increasing the sizes of conductors&#13;
on many distribution lines. These investments are needed to ensure that the power which&#13;
is to be transmitted from the Tuoketuo power station to Beijing can be efficiently relayed&#13;
to end-users while conforming to accepted standards of quality.&#13;
3.    The proposed component consists of the following items:&#13;
220 kV Indoor Substations&#13;
4.    Two new indoor substations will be constructed at Xibianmen and Xizhimen, two&#13;
areas in which the power demand is increasing rapidly. Xibianmen substation is to be&#13;
equipped with two 250 MVA, 220/110/10 kV transformers, two 30 MVAR capacitor&#13;
banks and gas-insulated switchgear (GIS). Xizhimen substation is proposed to have the&#13;
same configuration as Xibianmen but with two 200 MVA, 220/110/10 kV transformers.&#13;
Each substation will supply a number of 110/10 kV substations, which are not included in&#13;
the component but are either already existing or under construction. In addition, a&#13;
number of 10 kV feeders will emanate directly from the proposed substations. The&#13;
following element are also associated with the two new substations:&#13;
* 220 kV single-core XLPE cable (87.2 km)&#13;
*  110 kV single-core XLPE cable (1.1 km)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -                    ANNEX 4.2&#13;
* 10 kV switchgear (2 sets, 77 cubicles and 87 cubicles)&#13;
* Automatic transformer fire-extinguishing systems (2 sets)&#13;
* High-voltage protection equipment and substation supervisory and control&#13;
systems&#13;
5.    One 250 MVA, 220/110/10 kV transformer is to be installed in the Wangfujing&#13;
substation. This is an underground substation currently being constructed with two&#13;
250 MVA transformers. An additional transformer is required to efficiently satisfy the&#13;
rapidly increasing consumer demand. The proposed component therefore includes the&#13;
third transformer as well as the associated supply cables. In connection with and to&#13;
complement this project, NCPGC will undertake the following program, approved&#13;
separately and financed locally.&#13;
110/10 kV Transformers&#13;
6.    Four 50 MVA, 110/10 kV transformers will be installed to replace the overloaded,&#13;
inefficient transformers now installed in the Beicheng and Huichengmen substations.&#13;
The two substations were loaded at 104 percent and 98 percent of their respective rated&#13;
capacity in 1995. The existing transformers do not comply with statutory environmental&#13;
regulations concerning permissible noise levels, and the power utility must pay&#13;
appreciable amounts annually in penalties for not complying with the regulations.&#13;
Distribution Rehabilitation&#13;
7.    A pilot area of distribution system rehabilitation has been selected at Xizhimen&#13;
2&#13;
district located in the northwest of the city and covers an area of 8.3 km . The area is&#13;
densely populated and the power demand has been increasing rapidly. By the end of&#13;
1995, the area had a population of 220,000 and a peak demand of 40 MW. In order to&#13;
reduce the distribution losses and to improve the supply efficiency, the proposed&#13;
investments include:&#13;
&#149;  replacing the existing 41 km of 10 kV bare-conductor overhead line by three-&#13;
phase insulated conductor with larger cross-sections.&#13;
*  reconductoring of 32 km low-voltage lines&#13;
*  installation of five compact transformer stations with low-loss transformers&#13;
(6,300 kVA)&#13;
*  installation of 55 low-loss distribution transformers (16,025 kVA)&#13;
*  installation of 128 sets of capacitors&#13;
*  installation of 45 sets of distribution automation equipment&#13;
*  reconductoring of low-voltage lines to 8,905 residential consumers.&#13;
8.    The beneficiary of the component will be the North China Power Group Company&#13;
(NCPGC), which has responsibility for electricity transmission and distribution in&#13;
Beijing, through the Beijing Power Supply Company (BPSC). BPSC is an administrative&#13;
unit of NCPGC and not a legal entity in itself. NCPGC is also responsible for execution&#13;
of the component including construction, commissioning and operation. Beijing Power&#13;

ANNEX 4.6: CONSULTANCY SERVICES FOR&#13;
ESTABLISHING AND OPERATIONALIZING THE&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT UNIT (EMU)-TERMS&#13;
OF REFERENCE&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia contains vast coal reserves whose&#13;
development will be dramatically expanded in the near future. Consistent with this&#13;
increase in coal production will be the substantial development of power generation&#13;
facilities in this region on a scale heretofore never experienced. Tuoketuo Electric Power&#13;
Generation limited liability Company (TEPGC) recognized the need and priority for&#13;
addressing environmental and social issues in planning and implementing this&#13;
development.  Consequently, it is their intention to establish an environmental&#13;
management unit (EMU) within their corporate structure to insure proper attention is&#13;
given to these matters in terms of both immediate management, and their strategic&#13;
planning. TORs for this EMU are attached.&#13;
2.    In addition to TEPGC's efforts to incorporate the environmental and social&#13;
dimension to their development activities, local and regional environmental authorities&#13;
also play key roles, particularly with regard to air and water quality management. Air&#13;
quality was identified as a priority issue. These authorities wish technical assistance to&#13;
provide them with the necessary tools to prepare an quality management plan.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
3.    The objectives of this work effort are as follows:&#13;
* Design a detailed work program for the EMU&#13;
* Support initial startup and operation of the EMU&#13;
* Design a detailed training program in air quality management&#13;
4.    A description of the Consultant' work program is presented below.&#13;
DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMU WORK PROGRAM&#13;
5.    The Consultant will prepare a Work Program for the EMU for the next three&#13;
years. Prior to the preparation of this program, the Consultant will review: (a) the&#13;
Chinese regulatory framework (state, provincial and local) for pollution control and social&#13;
assessment, and (b) regional power sector development plans. The Consultant will then&#13;
Consultant is to be considered local unless otherwise noted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -                      ANNEX 4.6&#13;
hold discussions with appropriate government officials, and based on these discussions&#13;
identify key environmental and social issues associated with the development of power&#13;
generation capacity in the region.&#13;
6.    This Task will be the basis on which to identify the priority objectives and&#13;
activities of the EMU Work Program. Priority objectives should be developed for&#13;
implementation at both corporate and power station or field installation. For each set of&#13;
objectives, the Consultant should define specific performance criteria for each activity at&#13;
corporate and field levels.&#13;
7.    A staffing plan should be prepared by the Consultant in collaboration with staff of&#13;
TEPGC. This plan should incorporate both requirements for hiring new permanent staff,&#13;
reassignment of current staff, and utilizing consultants (local or foreign) for some of the&#13;
activities.&#13;
8.    The foreign Consultant will than prepare a training program consistent with the&#13;
staffing plan. This program will include identification of: necessary skills needed by the&#13;
EMU staff, appropriate trainers, and/or training programs (both domestic and&#13;
international). Visits to China by international experts, overseas travel by company&#13;
personnel for specific training programs are some of the possible options. Training&#13;
programs should include, but not be limited to the following subject areas: environment&#13;
and natural resources management, pollution control (air, water, solids), resettlement,&#13;
rehabilitation and community development, environmental monitoring, data collection&#13;
and processing, EIA preparation, environmental and safety audits, interpretation and&#13;
implementation of environmental regulations, and computer system design for&#13;
environmental management.&#13;
9.    The training program will include a curriculum for the various subjects, and a&#13;
estimate of classroom, and training aids needed. It should also include a mobilization&#13;
plan for the trainers, equipment, and facilities, to be utilized from within the company,&#13;
within China, or imported internationally.&#13;
10.   The foreign Consultant should also prepare a detailed financial plan for the&#13;
training program. The plan should identify costs (local/foreign) of international trainers,&#13;
overseas training by TEPGC staff, equipment and training aids (books, literature, tapes,&#13;
videos, etc.).&#13;
POLICY GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS&#13;
11.   The consultant will prepare draft policy guidelines and regulations consistent with&#13;
the objectives as specified in the TORs of the EMU (attached). In particular:&#13;
* Guidelines and interpretation of China's laws and regulations that will enable&#13;
the company to comply in a timely and cost-effective manner. Corporate&#13;
targets for atmospheric emissions of dust, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides,&#13;
wastewater effluent discharges, solid wastes (particularly ash, and spent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -                    ANNEX 4.6&#13;
sorbents from sulfur dioxide abatement systems), and worker health and&#13;
safety.&#13;
Targets will be established on the basis of anticipated future framework of&#13;
environmental regulation in China, international treaties/agreements, and&#13;
corporate development plans. The targets will depend on options in fuel&#13;
quality, abatement technology, and an assessment of potential for energy&#13;
conservation (demand side).&#13;
*  Guidelines for EIA preparation, identifying key issues, and requirements of&#13;
China, and multilateral institutions (World Bank, Asian Development Bank,&#13;
etc.).&#13;
*  Guidelines for resettlement and rehabilitation of peoples affected by corporate&#13;
projects.&#13;
*  Establish guidelines for the utilization, preservation and management of&#13;
natural resources (air, water, land, forests, cultural, etc.).&#13;
*  Guidelines for worker and workplace health and safety.&#13;
Technical/Operational and Management Guidelines&#13;
12.   The Consultant will prepare a set of operational standards, performance criteria,&#13;
good practice, and procedures for the following:&#13;
*  Worker Health: the Consultant will review standards of China, and various&#13;
international organizations, and use these as a basis of his recommendations.&#13;
-  Worker Safety: the Consultant will review plant safety rating systems and,&#13;
based upon these systems, formulate one or more systems for use in various&#13;
field installations.&#13;
*  Emergency Response:   The Consultant will prepare guidelines for&#13;
formulating emergency response plans.&#13;
*  Environmental Monitoring  and  Data Management System:   The&#13;
Consultant will prepare a monitoring guideline package for power plants and&#13;
transmission systems, including methods, equipment selection criteria, data&#13;
processing and reporting. The package should also include atmospheric&#13;
dispersion models (guidelines for selection), and monitoring of ecological&#13;
impacts at power stations and along transmission lines, community and&#13;
occupational health. The package should also include criteria for the selection&#13;
of monitoring contractors, and standard TOR.&#13;
*  Auditing: The Consultant will prepare detailed TOR for power plant and&#13;
transmission line environmental audits. Auditing procedures should include&#13;
worker health and safety aspects as well as environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108 -                     ANNEX 4.6&#13;
DESIGN OF A CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY&#13;
13.   The Consultant will prepare a detailed design of an environmental laboratory.&#13;
The design should include personnel requirements (number of staff and skills) sampling&#13;
and analysis equipment requirements (stationary and mobile), and complete itemization&#13;
of expendables (glassware, chemicals, etc.) to keep the laboratory operating for three&#13;
years.&#13;
DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM&#13;
14.   The foreign Consultant will review the environmental monitoring program for the&#13;
Tuoketuo thermal power station. Based upon this review, and the various environmental&#13;
monitoring requirements of China, IMEPB, HEPB and TEPB, the foreign Consultant will&#13;
establish the quantity and quality (electronically or manually recorded, etc.) of&#13;
environmental data to be received.&#13;
15.   Based upon this information, the foreign Consultant will design a computer-based&#13;
data collection and analysis system, which will include both hardware and software&#13;
requirements and design specifications. The design is to include system costs.&#13;
16.   After agreement is reached with EMU management on the environmental data&#13;
management system design, the foreign Consultant will assist the EMU in securing and&#13;
installing the equipment, and operationalizing the system.&#13;
17.   The system should be capable of generating environmental data reports to meet&#13;
the needs of TEPGC management, China's environmental authorities (NEPA), and both&#13;
the provincial and local environmental protection bureaus (IMEPB, TEPB). Furthermore,&#13;
the system design should be "expandable," in the sense that it can be readily adapted to&#13;
the additional environmental data that will be generated when the second, and third&#13;
phases of Tuoketuo are on line.&#13;
SUPPORT AND SERVICE: DESIGN OF AN AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT TRAINING&#13;
PROGRAM&#13;
18.   Local environmental officials are responsible for preparation of an air quality&#13;
management plan for the Tuoketuo area. Such a plan has not yet been prepared, nor do&#13;
the officials involved have the technical experience needed to produce this plan.&#13;
However, these officials wish to receive the necessary training in air quality management&#13;
to be able to accomplish this task.&#13;
19.   The foreign Consultant will design a technical training program for officials of the&#13;
local environmental protection bureaus, in the area of air quality management planning.&#13;
The training is to be designed so that trainees will subsequently be able to prepare an air&#13;
quality management plan for the Tuoketuo region.&#13;

research institute, etc.) identified by the foreign Consultant as knowledgeable and&#13;
qualified to offer this training.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE&#13;
22.   The Consultant will provide a team of professionals, the number will depend upon&#13;
their background, and experience in handling one or more of the assignments described&#13;
above. The team will be expected to assist in both establishing and operationalizing the&#13;
EMU. Written documentation concerning background and experience (Curriculum&#13;
Vitae) of the propose team members are to be submitted to both TEPGC and the World&#13;
Bank for review and approval prior to their final selection.&#13;
23.   Consultant involvement should be for about one year, although individual team&#13;
members may complete their specific assignments in less time, and be replaced by&#13;
another team member with skills associated with another aspect of the assignment. It is&#13;
expected that the Team Leader, and at least one associate will be present, full-time, for&#13;
the entire duration of the assignment.  The team will assume responsibility for&#13;
implementation after completion of the study report and its approval by the company and&#13;
the World Bank.&#13;
REPORT AND DELIVERABLES&#13;
24.   As a minimum the Consultant will prepare a report at the end of each Phase (see&#13;
"Reporting and Review" below). However, other working papers may be required during&#13;
program implementation. Reports will be submitted to the Technical Committee&#13;
appointed by the head of the EMU for review and evaluation. All data collected, reports,&#13;
and analysis shall be prepared in both in computer-accessible software (disk) and hard&#13;
copy. Copies of software with associated user manuals will also be supplied to the&#13;
company, and training in their use is to be provided on completion of the study.&#13;

ANNEX 4.7: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM&#13;
A. SUMMARY OF KEY PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES&#13;
Air Pollution&#13;
1.    Table 1 presents air pollution characteristics for the proposed project (1200 MW),&#13;
and the total power program planned for the site (3600 MW). As can be seen, emission&#13;
standards for dust, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides are all in compliance with Chinese&#13;
standards and World Bank guidelines. Air quality data are also presented, and for both&#13;
sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, it is predicted that the project (1200 MW) and overall&#13;
program (3600 MW) will not result in a violation of World Bank guidelines and most&#13;
Chinese standards.) Existing background dust levels exceed both Chinese standards, and&#13;
World Bank guidelines. This is not unusual for China in general, and in particular for&#13;
this area which is close to desert conditions. With project implementation, and ultimately&#13;
with the overall program, these dust levels have been estimated to be slightly elevated.&#13;
However, the estimated increases are so small as to be virtually undetectable if they were&#13;
real, and well within the error bounds of the model.&#13;
2.    Carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to be 0.0067 and 0.020 billion tons/year&#13;
for the 1,200 MW and 3,600 MW situations, respectively. This represents 0.031 and&#13;
0.093 percent of the annual industrial global burden.&#13;
3.    Finally, estimates of the Tuoketuo power program (3,600 MW) contribution to the&#13;
acid rain/acid deposition issues in China were estimated using the RAINS-ASIA model&#13;
developed in ASTEN. Results of these calculations indicated that the levels of acid&#13;
deposition are relatively low.&#13;
The "once maximum" for sulfur dioxide is estimated to exceed the Chinese standard by 3 percent when&#13;
the program is fully implemented (3,600 MW). For the proposed project (1,200 MW), no exceedance&#13;
occurs. Even in the case of the full 3,600 MW program, the small exceedance is well within the errors&#13;
of air quality modeling and monitoring.&#13;

excess wastewater will be discharged after appropriate treatment to meet Chinese&#13;
standards and World Bank guidelines. Treatment, when needed, will be either physical&#13;
and/or biological. Most of the cooling tower blowdown will be reused. A breakdown of&#13;
water reuse characteristics is presented below:&#13;

All effluent discharges will be to the Yellow River via the Gengqinggou canal. This&#13;
canal traverses some small farms, so much of this water will, in fact, be removed by&#13;
farmers for irrigation.&#13;
5.     Table 2 details liquid effluent streams, their pollution characteristics, and the&#13;
control measures to be taken. Additionally, Chinese effluent standards are provided. As&#13;
can be seen in the table, all effluents are in compliance with applicable standards.&#13;

6.     Impacts to water quality of the Yellow River from the effluent discharge were&#13;
estimated. From Table 3 presented below, it is seen that beyond the mixing zone in the&#13;
most critical situations (low flow, and average flow) water quality meets Chinese water&#13;
quality standards. Furthermore, the shape of the mixing zone does not traverse the entire&#13;
river width, so that mobile species can simply avoid the zone by swimming away.&#13;
Therefore, it is unlikely that the effluent will present any negative impact on aquatic&#13;
ecology of the Yellow River.&#13;

-114 -                      ANNEX 4.7&#13;
Coal Transport and Handling&#13;
7.    Fuel to the Tuoketuo power station will be low-sulfur bituminous coal obtained&#13;
from the Zhungeer Coal Mine. The mine is located approximately 44 km from the power&#13;
station. At the mine location a new, large coal-washing plant has been constructed, but is&#13;
not yet operational. The power station fuel supply will be an unwashed, screened product&#13;
of this washing plant, containing 0.47 percent sulfur and 30.0 percent ash. The coal&#13;
(14,520 tons/day) will be shipped along the Zhungeer-Fengzhen dedicated rail line, which&#13;
is under Zhungeer Coal Industry Corporation control.&#13;
8.    At the coal storage yard, sprinkling facilities using a portion of the cooling tower&#13;
blowdown will be installed for dust suppression. Spraying will be done on a regular&#13;
basis. A rotary sprinkler system will be provided for dust suppression at loading and&#13;
unloading sections of the stacker reclaimer, belt conveyor, and feeder. A cyclone&#13;
separator will be used at each transfer station, coal bunker bay and in the crusher room.&#13;
Baghouses will be provided at coal storage silos. All excess runoff water shall be&#13;
collected, treated and recycled.&#13;
Ash Management&#13;
9.    Ash will be slurried with cooling water blowdown and pumped to the Gaobashi&#13;
ash yard. The ash yard is about 2 km south of the power station has sparse vegetation and&#13;
poor soil stability. Currently two households (four people) live at the site and they will&#13;
be resettled. For Phase 1 (1,200 MW), the site occupies 3.36 km2, will be constructed to&#13;
a height of 15 meters and its life is estimated at 17.3 years. When all three phases are&#13;
2&#13;
complete (3,600 MW), the site will be expanded to 6.36 km , will be filled to a height of&#13;
30 meters, and have an expected life of 24 years.&#13;
10.   Most of the site has a natural layer of clay to protect groundwater. However, there&#13;
are sufficient areas at the site that do not have this clay layer. Modeling studies indicated&#13;
that if the site were to be used without an additional impermeable liner, the groundwater&#13;
would become polluted. There are four potable wells within 500-1,000 m of the site, so&#13;
protection of this groundwater is required. Based upon these factors, a sufficient layer of&#13;
clay will be added at those points at the disposal area where there is no naturally&#13;
occurring clay. Then, a geotextile liner, 3-4 mm thick, will be used over the entire ash&#13;
disposal site to protect groundwater.  Potable wells will be monitored regularly&#13;
throughout the project life, and additional monitoring wells will be drilled at the site&#13;
periphery to further ensure against contamination.&#13;
11.   To prevent dusting, the area will be covered with water. A sprinkling system&#13;
utilizing recirculated cooling tower blowdown is included as a protective measure, should&#13;
any localized "dry spots" occur at the ash yard. Water drains underneath the ash yard will&#13;
collect water and recycle it with the ash slurry system. The ash yard will be partitioned&#13;
into cells, each representing about 10 percent of the total surface area. Cells will be used&#13;
one at a time. Each cell will be filled and covered before the next one is used. This will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115 -                      ANNEX 4.7&#13;
further minimize dust formation and ensure adequate water is available to wet the ash&#13;
suffice in the driest periods of the year.&#13;
12.   A 100 meter band of forest will be planted around the yard, to act as a windbreak&#13;
and remove the site from view. When the ash yard is filled, it will be covered with soil&#13;
and revegetated in a manner consistent with principles of dryland vegetation.&#13;
Transmission Line and Distribution System&#13;
13.   The 500 kV line will deliver power to Beijing a distance of approximately&#13;
507 km. The line will travel over rugged mountainous terrain as well as farmland, and&#13;
cross eight rivers (none navigable), through the Provinces of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and&#13;
Hebei. There will be no resettlement involved, and no historic or protected areas (local or&#13;
State) are traversed. The closest site along the route is the Heng Mountain scenic spot,&#13;
32 km from the power line.&#13;
14.   There are no migratory bird routes crossing the transmission lines, so no&#13;
protective measures will be used on the transmission towers to prevent bird electrocution.&#13;
It is estimated that about 40 km2 of land will be occupied by the transmission towers.&#13;
Tower design will be in accordance with all Chinese standards with respect to noise and&#13;
electric field.&#13;
15.   Within the Xizhimen region of Beijing, a distribution component will replace&#13;
some lines in the distribution network as well as some existing transformers with five&#13;
compact transformer stations.  No impacts are expected from  these replacement/&#13;
rehabilitation activities. No PCBs will be used in the transformers or capacitors, and this&#13;
will be so specified in the bid documents. Transformers that are to be replaced do not&#13;
contain PCBs and written assurances have been provided by responsible authorities&#13;
confirming this fact.&#13;
Railway&#13;
16.   Coal will be transported along a dedicated rail line from coal-washing plant to&#13;
power station. The railroad will be located along the eastern bank of the Yellow River.&#13;
The route passes through both rugged mountainous terrain and flat farming areas. Special&#13;
attention will be paid to construction techniques, particularly in the mountainous region,&#13;
to avoid modifications to runoff patterns. The rail will be designed to minimize noise&#13;
when trains are in use. The track will occupy approximately 260.2 ha but no resettlement&#13;
will be required.&#13;
17.   There are four stations along the route. Two of these stations, Wang Yu Ying and&#13;
Lan Jia Yao, will generate a total of 37 m3/day of wastewater, which will be skimmed for&#13;
removal of oil (0.647 kg/day). Treated wastewater will be used for irrigation, and&#13;
collected oil will be given to employees for use as cooking oil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-116-                        ANNEX 4.7&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
18.   The water source for the power plant will be the Yellow River. For Phase I,&#13;
approximately 1.0 m3/sec will be required. There are three basic components to the water&#13;
supply system: intake structure, treatment (clarification/settling pond), and delivery&#13;
pipeline to the power station. Location of the intake structure is approximately 12 km&#13;
southwest of the plant site. Of the total water withdrawn, the portion of water to be used&#13;
for cooling tower makeup will be chlorinated.&#13;
19.   The river bank will be stabilized to protect the intake structure. This will have the&#13;
added benefit of stabilizing the river course, preventing erosion, and protecting both the&#13;
people and property in the vicinity. Impacts on navigation at the location of the intake&#13;
structure were estimated to be negligible.&#13;
20.   The chief potential impact will be dust generated at the area to be established for&#13;
disposition of silt which will be removed from the settling pond. A 71.3 ha site is to be&#13;
established for this purpose. It will be filled to a height of 3.4 meters. In order to&#13;
minimize dust generation, silt will be conditioned to make it easy to vegetate and then the&#13;
area will be reclaimed with appropriate plants. A windbreak will also be planted on the&#13;
periphery to lower wind velocity, and thereby further reduce dust generation potential.&#13;
Noise&#13;
21.   The power station is to be located in a sparsely populated area. There are no&#13;
major communities, or human activities within the vicinity proposed for the plant.&#13;
Nonetheless, the plant will be designed so that all equipment will meet the appropriate&#13;
standards of maximum allowable noise generation (GB 12348-90: Noise Standard at&#13;
Boundaries of Industries and Enterprises). These requirements will be specified in the&#13;
equipment bid documents.&#13;
22.   An analysis of noise potential indicated the following sources were most&#13;
significant: turbine generator set, coal mill, cooling tower, and transformer section. The&#13;
analysis further indicated that to ensure noise standards will be met in the community,&#13;
silencers are to be used for the boiler safety valves, and boiler exhaust. The plant&#13;
enclosure will be sound-proofed to contain noise generated by the turbine, coal grinding&#13;
units, etc.&#13;
23.   Chinese noise standards are more stringent than those of the World Bank. Thus,&#13;
compliance with Chinese standards offers implicit compliance with World Bank&#13;
Environmental Guidelines.&#13;
Aquatic/Terrestrial Ecology&#13;
24.   The project will be located in a relatively uninhabited area that is classified as dry&#13;
semi-arid grassland. Forest growth in the area is poor and it is considered to be of low&#13;
botanical diversity and difficult to afforest. The quantity of aquatic species in the Yellow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-117 -                      ANNEX 4.7&#13;
River are considered to be low production. There are no rare or endangered species, and&#13;
few animal species inhabiting the site.&#13;
25.   During construction, there will be some disruption (temporary and permanent) to&#13;
both wildlife habitat and vegetative cover. However, appropriate construction techniques&#13;
should minimize any impacts. A large soil conservation/desertification control program&#13;
is included in the project, which will more than compensate for any loss of vegetative&#13;
cover.&#13;
26.   Air quality impacts to agriculture and vegetation from sulfur dioxide (SO2) and&#13;
fluoride (F-) were estimated to be negligible. Ash pond runoff waters will be collected&#13;
and managed, and all wastewaters will be treated to standards prior to discharge.&#13;
Therefore no impacts on the aquatic ecology are anticipated.&#13;
Occupational Health and Safety&#13;
27.   Appropriate considerations will be incorporated into the design and operation of&#13;
the plant and related facilities to insure worker health and safety. Special considerations&#13;
were incorporated into the design to assure safe conditions in the management of&#13;
hazardous materials (fuel oil, chlorine, hydrogen, caustic, etc.). International standards of&#13;
worker safety will be included in all bid documents of project equipment. Boilers, and&#13;
other potentially dangerous equipment will be designed to meet ASME standards of&#13;
safety and will be so specified in the bid documents. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)&#13;
are illegal in China; their use is prohibited in the project. Prohibition of asbestos will be&#13;
specified in the bid documents.&#13;
Human Environment&#13;
28.   There are no important tourism resources in the Tuoketuo area. No sites of&#13;
archaeological, historic, religious, architectural or aesthetic value recognized by the State&#13;
or the autonomous region are located at the project area. The nearest cultural landmarks&#13;
are in the capital city of Hohhot.&#13;
29.   From June 20 to June 22, 1994, public meetings were held at Xikoukou village of&#13;
Yanshanying county. General conclusions of the participants were:&#13;
*  Tuoketuo project is beneficial to both country and local people&#13;
*  The project will not cause environmental pollution, but rather improve the&#13;
local standard of living&#13;
*  Relocation arrangements were satisfactory&#13;
*  The project will improve the local economy&#13;

ANNEX 4.8: DESERTIFICATION CONTROL COMPONENT&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Tuoketuo thermal power plant (2x600 MW) is located in a region where soil&#13;
erosion and land desertification causes an increasing concern. As part of the project, a&#13;
desertification control component has been designed and will be implemented in order to&#13;
mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of the power plant and to contribute to&#13;
improving the conditions and standards of living of the population in the project area&#13;
(about 46,000 people).&#13;
Scope of the Component&#13;
2.    The component consists of two parts:&#13;
(a)   Part A: intensive afforestation of the areas immediately surrounding the&#13;
power plant, ash disposal yard, cooling water intake, water supply and&#13;
discharge pipelines, and access roads.&#13;
(b)   Part B: selective afforestation of the region around the Tuoketuo power&#13;
plant, covering a total surface area of 400 km2 (20 km x 20 km)&#13;
concerming two counties and one minority banner (equivalent to county).&#13;
3.    The total afforested area upon completion of this component will be 3,137 ha&#13;
(4,535,000 trees), in which Part A involves 120 ha (228,000 trees). An illustration map&#13;
(IBRD 28283) is attached. The major activities of the component comprise:&#13;
(a)   afforestation by manual planting and aerial seeding,&#13;
(b)   introduction of high-wind and drought-resistant tree species to the existing&#13;
sparse and low-yield forestry,&#13;
(c)   construction of a nursery to provide seedlings,&#13;
(d)   dissemination of new technologies of afforestation to local people, and&#13;
(e)   landscaping around the power plant.&#13;
4.    The equipment and facilities in association with this component include motor-&#13;
pumped wells and canals for irrigation, planting equipment, vehicles, access roads, tool&#13;
warehouse, power supply and communication facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Cost Estimate and Financing Plan&#13;
5.    The investment cost of the component is estimated at Y 9.05 million (about $1.09&#13;
million), of which the Part A related cost is Y 2.49 million. Details are shown in Table 1.&#13;

Total Component Cost                  9,051.4&#13;
6.    It should be noted that the component cost is underestimated. Part of volunteer&#13;
work by local people for forestry transformation is not included in the cost. The cost&#13;
disbursement schedule is given below:&#13;

7.    The component will be financed by TEPGC, central government and local&#13;
government. TEPGC will meet the entire cost of Part A and contribute 25 percent of the&#13;
cost of Part B, which together will amount to Y 4.18 million. The balance will be&#13;
covered by government funds, of which 30 percent by the Ministry of Forestry and 70&#13;
percent by Hohhot municipality and Tuoketuo county.&#13;
Implementation Aspect&#13;
8.    A unit in charge of implementation of this component will be set up within the&#13;
organization of TEPGC. The unit will have 11 permanent employees. Temporary&#13;
workers will be contracted as required. The unit will work closely with the local&#13;
government and people. Since the purpose and activities of the component comply with&#13;
that of three state-sponsored programs, known as "Three-North Shelter Forest Program,"&#13;
"Nationwide Afforestation Program" and "Nationwide Sand Prevention and Control&#13;
Program," it is expected that strong supports will be given by the govermnent at different&#13;
levels in implementing the component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-126 -                       ANNEX 4.8&#13;
9.    The feasibility study of this component was carried out by the Inner Mongolia&#13;
Forestry Science Academy, which is experienced in desertification control. The selected&#13;
species are best suited to local environment conditions, and high pollution resistant. They&#13;
also yield high economic value. Locally available species will be widely used. The&#13;
designed multifunction forests are for timber, road shelter, farm field shelter, sand control&#13;
shelter, soil conservation and cash-tree. The year-to-year afforestation plan is given&#13;
below:&#13;

Economic Cost/Benefit Analysis&#13;
10.   All the costs and benefits are expressed in economic terms using shadow pricing.&#13;
The actual market rate is used as the shadow price for labor costs. Taxes are excluded.&#13;
The planning period is 20 years (1997-2016).&#13;
11.   The costs include investment costs and operating costs. The benefits of the&#13;
component stem from direct incomes, environmental and social benefits.&#13;
(a)    Direct incomes are from  selling forestry products, such as timber,&#13;
seedling, and fruits, and are measured by the market values.&#13;
(b)   Environmental benefit.  The implementation of the component can&#13;
protect the facilities of the power plant as well as 21 km railway and road&#13;
from soil and wind erosion. It will protect 3,578 ha of agricultural land.&#13;
Protection of agricultural land from soil and wind erosion are counted as&#13;
indirect benefits, which are measured using the standard issued by the&#13;
"Three-North Shelter Forest Program." In addition, afforestation will&#13;
improve the air quality because trees are very effective in absorption of&#13;
S02 and CO2. It is also expected that a 10-15 dB reduction of noise level&#13;
will be achieved at the area of the power plant. However, these two items&#13;
are not included in the benefit calculation.&#13;
(c)    Social benefit. Construction and operation of a power plant on a scale of&#13;
1,200 MW in one of the poorest counties in China will create jobs and&#13;
generate incomes in the region, and thus greatly alleviate poverty&#13;
conditions in Tuoketuo county. However, only the afforestation program&#13;
directly related social benefits are discussed here. The component will&#13;
provide 11 permanent jobs (in the implementation unit) as well as 2,260&#13;
persons for short-term afforestation work. Local people will also benefit&#13;
from the new technologies introduced in developing high-wind and&#13;

ANNEX 4.9: LAND ACQUISITION AND RELOCATION&#13;
General&#13;
1.    Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant and Beijing T&amp;D are the two main components of&#13;
the project. Both components involve land acquisition, and relocation of population. The&#13;
resettlement for the former takes place in the rural area in Inner Mongolia and for the&#13;
latter in the urban area of Beijing. The priority was given to minimize the scope of&#13;
resettlement throughout the project design and planning. Where land acquisition and&#13;
demolition of existing housing are unavoidable, the resettlement plans provide for&#13;
replacement of housing, agricultural land, infrastructure, services and other resources.&#13;
The RAPs aim at improving the standards of living of the PAPs or at least to restoring&#13;
them.&#13;
2.    For Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant, the resettlement will be carried out in two&#13;
phases. The first phase includes resettlement activities related to the power plant site and&#13;
the ash disposal site and the second phase includes resettlement activities related to the&#13;
railway connection and the water intake line from Yellow River. A Resettlement Action&#13;
Plan (RAP) has been prepared for the first phase. The RAP for the second phase will be&#13;
prepared by mid-1997 following the completion of the design of the railway connection&#13;
and the water intake line. A separate RAP has been prepared for the Beijing T&amp;D&#13;
component. The Bank carried out full review of the RAPs and the assessment found that&#13;
the resettlement needs of the Project-Affected Persons (PAP) are well analyzed and&#13;
methods of mitigating the adverse impacts are thoroughly formulated. The Bank's&#13;
comments on how to improve the prepared RAP are being taken into account by TEPGC&#13;
and NCPGC in finalization of their RAP prior to the appraisal mission.&#13;
3.   In connection with construction of Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant, three 500 kV&#13;
transmission lines and associated sub- and switching stations will be constructed under a&#13;
separate project which does not involve World Bank funding.  A framework of&#13;
resettlement policy and organization has been prepared by NCPGC. It is assured (a) that&#13;
the RAP for the 500 kV transmission project will be prepared in accordance with the laws&#13;
and regulations of China as well as the Guidelines of the World Bank (Operational&#13;
Directive 4.30) and (b) that the living standard of the Project-Affected Persons (PAP) will&#13;
improve or at least be restored after the project implementation.&#13;
Scope&#13;
4.    Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant.  Tuoketuo thermal power plant includes&#13;
construction of a new power plant consisting of 2 x 600 MW coal-fired units. The site of&#13;
the power plant is located in Yanshanying Township of Tuoketuo County, Huhhot City.&#13;
The project area includes power station boundary, ash yard, dedicated railroad and water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-130-                      ANNEX4.9&#13;
intake line from Yellow River which involve three counties and ten townships. The&#13;
region has vast territory and a sparse population. Except for agricultural production, no&#13;
other industry is developed. The plant site and the ash yard will cover 360 ha of land and&#13;
involve Tuoketuo County, two townships and nine villages. No public facilities and&#13;
enterprises exist in the area. The plant will require: (a) land acquisition of about 836 ha&#13;
(12,541 mu), of which 465 ha (55.6 percent) is cultivated land, and (b) demolition of 27&#13;
2&#13;
houses with a total floor space of 3,340 m . The total number of the affected persons is&#13;
2,253.&#13;
5.    Beijing T&amp;D. Xibianmen substation is located in the inner city of Beijing. The&#13;
2&#13;
construction of Xibianmen requires acquisition of 6,100 m  of land, demolition of 239&#13;
houses, and relocation of 935 persons. It also requires demolition of five small shops&#13;
with an average area of 7 m2 and a small amount of public facilities (including 360 m of&#13;
rainwater pipe, 260 m of tapwater pipe, 270 m of heating pipe, 12 power poles, and 12&#13;
telephone wire poles). However, this program is part of a wider planned program of the&#13;
urban renovation and development of Beijing under the responsibility of Beijing&#13;
Municipal Construction Development Corporation (BMCDC). The majority of the&#13;
residential houses to be demolished are old and hazardous with poor sanitation facilities.&#13;
There is no resettlement need for Wangfujing and Xizhimen because the former is an&#13;
underground substation under construction and the latter will be built using the site of the&#13;
existing 110 kV substation. The pilot project of distribution rehabilitation involves&#13;
mainly reconductoring and installation of compact transformers and capacitors and does&#13;
not require any resettlement.&#13;
Legal Framework for Land Acquisition, Demolition, Relocation and Resettlement&#13;
6.    The Bank Requirements. The RAPs have been prepared in line with the&#13;
requirements contained in the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30: Involuntary&#13;
Resettlement as well as applicable national and local laws and regulations.&#13;
National and Local Laws and Regulations&#13;
7.    The main state law "Land Management Law of the People's Republic of China,"&#13;
which was enacted in 1988, has been applied to the both components. The local laws and&#13;
regulations that are applied respectively to the two components are as follows.&#13;
8.    The local implementation regulations applied to Tuoketuo thermal power plant&#13;
include: Implementation of "The Land Management Law of the People's Republic of&#13;
China" issued by Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and "Land Management Method&#13;
of Huhhot" which was ratified by the Huhhot Municipality in 1992.&#13;
9.    Local laws and regulations issued by Beijing Municipal Authorities and applied to&#13;
Beijing T&amp;D component include: "Implementing Measures of Land Management Law&#13;
of People's Republic of China," "Fine Penalty Regulations for the Implementing&#13;
Measures of Land Management Law of People's Republic of China," and "Implementing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -                    ANNEX 4.9&#13;
Measures on Provisional Regulations of Use-Right Grant and Assignment of City and&#13;
Town State-Owned Land of People's Republic of China."&#13;
10.   During the preparation of RAPs, it was made sure that all the resettlement&#13;
activities and compensation policies are strictly governed by the applicable laws,&#13;
regulations and the Bank Guidelines.  Arrangements for relocation, prepared in&#13;
collaboration with local authorities and the population affected by the project, are in line&#13;
with Chinese national and provincial policies. Special attention was given to the most&#13;
vulnerable groups (households headed by women, senior people and poorest households).&#13;
Compensation Policies and Rates&#13;
11.   Tuoketuo Thermal Power Plant. Based on the national and local regulations of&#13;
the province and city, it is determined for the Tuoketuo Power Project that compensation&#13;
for cultivated land is 4.5 times of average output value per mu for three years before land&#13;
acquisition. Compensation for woodland will be implemented according to three times&#13;
cumulative value of grown timber and wood compensation is based on the cumulative&#13;
value of 6 m3 per mu.  For demolished and relocated houses, Tuoketuo County&#13;
Government allocated an area from the state-owned land for construction of a new village&#13;
for the PAP. TEPGC makes a financial contribution to it.&#13;
12.   The compensation rates are as follows:&#13;

resettled housing area shall not be less than the original floor space. For the residents&#13;
moved from within the second-ring-road section (inner city) into outside the third-ring-&#13;
road section, the resettled housing area shall be increased using a specified formula or a&#13;
lump sum compensation be paid off (Y 25,000-30,000). All the PAPs will be relocated&#13;
into new and higher-quality housing. Furthermore, the PAPs will be given a choice of&#13;
several resettlement locations. Compensation for the resettlement housing will be&#13;
calculated at replacement cost without depreciation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-132-                      ANNEX4.9&#13;
14.   For residents who are living in a small house (or an apartment) with floor space&#13;
per capita below the current standard minimum living area in Beijing, the standard&#13;
minimum living area will be provided.&#13;
15.   For small shops, apart from the replacement cost of the shops, the relocation costs&#13;
and production losses during shutdown of business will also be compensated. For the&#13;
public facilities, the reconstruction (relocation) will be carried out on the basis of the&#13;
scale and quantity of the existing facilities following appropriate construction engineering&#13;
standards. Reconstruction will be completed before the existing facilities is removed.&#13;
16.   The applicable compensation rates are:&#13;

Implementation Organization and Strategy&#13;
17.   A Project Resettlement Office with six staff members was established in May&#13;
1993 in TEPGC to oversee the management and implementation of resettlement&#13;
program. It will be assisted by Tuoketuo County Resettlement Office and Yanshanying&#13;
Township Resettlement Office. Two senior members of the office have received training&#13;
on involuntary resettlement sponsored by MOF.&#13;
18.   A Project Resettlement Office has been established to oversee the resettlement&#13;
work related to Xibianmen substation. It consists of representatives from Beijing&#13;
Municipal Power Supply Company (BMPSC), which is a division of NCPGC, BMCDC,&#13;
the Government of Xicheng District, and Beijing Municipality.&#13;
19.   For Tuoketuo thermal power plant, the new village will be constructed and made&#13;
available to PAP before December 31, 1996. After the completion of its construction and&#13;
the relocation of PAPs, demolition of the old houses will be carried out by owner&#13;
themselves. All the properties and materials of the old houses will belong to the resettled&#13;
households.&#13;
20.   The demolition and the rehabilitation of the houses will be completed before&#13;
March 1997 so that the spring plow of PAP would not be affected. Based on the&#13;
implementation plan, all PAP will be resettled near their original place. The new village&#13;
is within 300 meters of the existing village, and 250 meters of the Huhhot-Zhungeer&#13;
highway. All new houses will be built in bricks and wood. New public facilities will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133-                        ANNEX4.9&#13;
provided in the new village such as clinic, school, shopping and cultural centers.&#13;
Displaced farmers will continue their agricultural activities in the newly reclaimed&#13;
agricultural lands in new irrigation areas. Four motor-pumped wells will be installed for&#13;
irrigation purposes.&#13;
21.   The preparation for the construction of the new houses has already been carried&#13;
out. The design of the new house of each household affected by the project will be&#13;
carried out by the resettlement office of the county in consultation with the PAP. The&#13;
construction will be carried out by the local construction teams.&#13;
22.   The principle to minimize the resettlement of PAP as much as possible for&#13;
selection of the site and the ash yard was fully taken into consideration. Therefore, the&#13;
project will have less influence on the electrical, communication and other utility&#13;
facilities. Power supply, communication and other facilities for the construction of the&#13;
new village and for the exploitation of the new lands will be completed during the&#13;
rehabilitation. All roads through the site or ash yard will be relocated outside them. All&#13;
canals and ditches will be reconstructed outside the power plant area.&#13;
23.   Displaced households by Xibianmen substation will be relocated in new&#13;
apartment buildings with modem  facilities in a close-by residential areas, namely:&#13;
Majiabao, Donguantou, and Yalin. As housing is already commercialized in China,&#13;
NCPGC will purchase houses for the PAP in these three residential areas. All of them&#13;
can fully meet various requirement of residence in terms of comfort and convenience.&#13;
Consultation will be made on a household by household basis with the PAP regarding&#13;
their needs. All the public facilities such as road, water supply, sewage, heating, gas, and&#13;
electricity as well as auxiliary service facilities such as education, health, commerce,&#13;
garden and cultural facilities in these three areas will be completed before December&#13;
1996.&#13;
Cost Estimates&#13;
24.   The cost estimates are provided below. The total resettlement costs including&#13;
contingencies for the two components amount to Y 296.5 million.&#13;

Resettlement Monitoring&#13;
26.   TEPGC and NCPGC respectively contracted the Inner Mongolia Academy of&#13;
Social Science (IMASS) and the Beijing Social and Psychological Research Institute&#13;
(BSPRI) to monitor the resettlement activities and provide an independent evaluation of&#13;
resettlement. The monitoring and evaluation will be based on a sample of 10 to 15&#13;
percent of affected population. The objective of monitoring and evaluation is to ensure&#13;
that the resettlement program is implemented smoothly and that the standards of living of&#13;
the PAPs are improved or at least restored during the first year following their&#13;
resettlement. The agreed outline of the first-year monitoring report includes reviewing&#13;
resettlement progress among all components; examining the use of resettlement finds;&#13;
and assessing situation regarding production restoration among relocated population, if&#13;
any; living condition improvements (housing and related services and facilities); and&#13;
administration capacity of resettlement organizations.  The group will produce a&#13;
resettlement progress report for the project office and the Bank every six months during&#13;
implementation of resettlement and annually thereafter.  After the completion of&#13;
resettlement implementation, a resettlement evaluation report will be completed.&#13;
Conflict Resolution and Grievance Procedure&#13;
27.   PAPs with grievances will be able to submit their complaints to the implementing&#13;
and supervising authorities of the project and are assured to receive a response within one&#13;
month of the submission date.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Inner Mongolia (Tuoketuo) Thermal
            Power Project is intended to: (1) increase electricity
            supply and electricity trade in North China by creating an
            independent power company to develop a mine-mouth power
            plant; (2) improve the efficiency of energy supply and use
            in the region by introducing modern technologies and
            implementing effective operations and maintenance practices
            and procedures in power generation, and reducing losses in
            Beijing's transmission and distribution systems; (3)
            advance the power sector reform process; (4) diversify
            financing sources, improve the access of power entities to
            international financial markets, and encourage
            private-sector investment in existing and new power sector
            enterprises; and (5) promote economic development and also
            improve soil conservation and desertification control in
            Tuoketuo county.  The first and largest of the two
            components, the Tuoketuo thermal power plant and associated
            technical assistance, includes construction of the first two
            coal-fired subcritical thermal units in Inner Mongolia, the
            power station's first phase; technical assistance to
            the Tuoketuo electric power company for accounting and
            management systems; and a desertification control and
            dryland management program to improve environmental
            conditions. The second component includes construction of
            two indoor substations at Xibianmen and Xizhimen, the
            addition of a third transformer in an underground substation
            currently under construction, and technical assistance to
            the North China Power Group Company for implementing
            accounting and financial management systems.
