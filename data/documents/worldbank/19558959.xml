STATUTORY COMMITTEE REPORT&#13;
TO:    The President, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
Report of the Committee under Section 4 (iii) of Article III of the Articles of Agreement on the&#13;
proposed Loan (Second Governance, Opportunities and Jobs Development Policy Loan) to the&#13;
Republic of Tunisia&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the Articles of Agreement of&#13;
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) hereby submits its report pursuant to&#13;
Section 4 (iii) of Article III of said Articles in respect of the proposal that the Bank grants to the Republic&#13;
of Tunisia a loan in an amount of E181,300,000. The purpose of said loan is to establish the policy&#13;
foundations for a more competitive business environment, a strengthened financial sector, more inclusive&#13;
and accountable social services, and more transparent public governance.&#13;
1.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a loan, and of the&#13;
purpose to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the program in support of which the proceeds of such loan&#13;
are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in Article I of said Articles of&#13;
Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the development of the productive facilities and&#13;
resources of the Republic of Tunisia and is in the interest of the Republic of Tunisia and of the members&#13;
of the Bank as a whole.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said program merits financial assistance from the Bank,&#13;
and hereby recommends said program for such assistance.&#13;
