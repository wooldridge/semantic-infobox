&#13;
&#13;
These guidelines are directed to the economic analysis of power sector policy analysis and the&#13;
appraisal of power sector investment projects. The general guidance is complemented by an&#13;
Annex Volume that contains relevant technical notes, a glossary, and an extended&#13;
Bibliography.&#13;
&#13;
In this first edition, the focus of the technical notes is on grid-connected renewable energy&#13;
projects. In FY16 the scope of the technical notes will be extended to cover transmission &amp;&#13;
distribution, rural electrification, off-grid, energy efficiency, and thermal projects.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;1.        INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
____________________________________________________________________________________&#13;
&#13;
1.     In June 2013 the Bank issued new guidelines for the economic analysis of projects.1&#13;
These guidelines explain the revised approach to economic analysis introduced in the April&#13;
2013 version of BP10.00: Investment Project Financing. These require three questions be&#13;
answered of all projects:&#13;
     1.   What is the projectâ&#128;&#153;s development impact? This is the traditional question underlying&#13;
          the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s approach to cost-benefit analysis. It requires careful consideration of the&#13;
          expected stream of project benefits and costs, grounded in an explicit causal&#13;
          framework linking project activities to targeted outcomes.&#13;
     2.   Is public sector provision or financing the appropriate vehicle? This question probes&#13;
          the rationale for public involvement with respect to financing and/or implementation&#13;
          and should explicitly consider alternative modes of provision.&#13;
     3.   What is the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s value added? This question examines the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
          contribution to the project. It seeks to determine the benefit from Bank staff&#13;
          involvement and whether the proposed project maximizes the development impact of&#13;
          staff effort.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Moreover, the new guidelines stress the importance of deciding already at the PCN&#13;
stage on the form and content of the economic analysis that the team will undertake during&#13;
preparation, necessitating advance thinking about economic analysis prior to the Project&#13;
Concept Note (PCN) meeting. Economic analysis, and economic reasoning, should assist in the&#13;
choice and design of projects, rather than simply serving as a final quality check at the late&#13;

3.       The OPSPQ guidelines apply to the analysis of all investment projects financed by the&#13;
World Bank, and are necessarily general. They set out in some detail the rationale for the new&#13;
approach, and how economic analysis should be used to help the design of a project. The&#13;
guidelines provide general advice in setting out the form and content of an economic analysis&#13;
as listed in Table 1.1: for each point we note the relevant issues for the typical energy project â&#128;&#147;&#13;
a more detailed discussion of which is provided in Section 2.&#13;

the postulated baseline.&#13;
(3) To the extent possible, delineate and              Many power sector projects have as a significant&#13;
describe anticipated project benefits, both            benefit the avoidance of environmental&#13;
direct and indirect, and their likely timing.          externalities associated with fossil fuel generation.&#13;
Note that for projects whose objectives are            Several of the technical notes discuss how such&#13;
reducing environmental or other sorts of               externalities can be quantified and monetized (M4,&#13;
negative externalities, it is this reduction in        M5), and how energy security and learning curve&#13;
spillover costs that needs to be quantified and        benefits should be evaluated (C7,T3).&#13;
monetized as benefit. A similar observation&#13;
applies in the case of investment projects whose&#13;
goals are to foster positive externalities (for&#13;
example, investment in technology innovation&#13;
and diffusion).&#13;
(4)List the set of variables required to perform a     With many power sector projects involving private&#13;
financial analysis, if needed.                         sector participation, financial analysis is always&#13;
                                                       needed (and is in any event required for an&#13;
                                                       adequate distributional analysis).&#13;
(5) Identify which of the listed costs and             The Technical Notes discuss what can and what&#13;
benefits can be quantitatively measured with           can not be readily quantified and monetized. In&#13;
existing knowledge and which may likely be             some cases the Bank has already issued special&#13;
quantitatively measured cost-effectively with          guidance notes (such as the guidance note on&#13;
information gained during project preparation.         valuation of GHG emissions).&#13;
(6) Identify any possible externalities resulting      See M4 and M5 for damage cost estimates from&#13;
from project outcomes, both positive and               fossil fuel combustion.&#13;
negative (for example, environmental impacts).&#13;
Note which externalities might be quantitatively&#13;
measured before or during project preparation.&#13;
Those that can be quantified and monetized&#13;
should be treated as part of the overall set of&#13;
project costs or benefits as outlined above.&#13;
(7) Assess the degree of risk and uncertainty          It is often argued that the cost of renewable energy&#13;
relating to anticipated project                        is largely locked in at construction, and therefore&#13;
impact/effectiveness as well as degree of              less subject to future variation than its fossil fueled&#13;

and external effects), the source of the variance,&#13;
and an idea of the extent of variation. Take into      Energy efficiency, loss reduction, and rehabilitation&#13;
consideration the range of possible variations         projects tend to be more robust with respect to&#13;
and the extent of uncertainty attached to the          many exogenous risk factors than greenfield&#13;
outcomes.                                              generation projects.&#13;
(8) Assess the feasibility of analytic activities&#13;
during preparation, given the time and&#13;
resources available, that could fill in key data&#13;
gaps. What analysis can be done within the&#13;
required timeframe? Determine whether the&#13;
analysis can be completed given the allocated&#13;
resources?&#13;
(9) Delineate estimated costs and benefits             In the case of power sector projects, many&#13;
identified that cannot be measured or valued           externalities can be quantified but not easily&#13;
given the current state of knowledge                   monetized (or where monetization is highly&#13;

&#13;
4.      In short, the OPSPQ guidelines describe what is to be done in an economic analysis for&#13;
a bank-funded project, and why it should be done: the guidelines for economic analysis set out&#13;
here focus on how it is to be done in the specific case of power sector projects.&#13;

SCOPE AND FORM OF THE ANALYSIS&#13;
8.      The scope and form of an economic &amp; financial analysis should be adjusted to the main&#13;
categories of project:&#13;
ï&#130;·    Large greenfield projects, often $500 million and more, often involving other major IFIs, with&#13;
     typically large project preparation budgets, and often with comprehensive feasibility studies&#13;
     completed: most large generation and high voltage transmission projects fall into this category.3 The&#13;
     sheer scale of such projects generally warrant application of the full set of economic analysis tools&#13;
     described in these Guidelines..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3        Among renewable energy projects, typical examples in this category include the Morocco CSP Project (World&#13;
         Bank Report-4663-MA) and the Tarbela Hydro extension project (Bank Report 60963-PK).&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                 4&#13;
&amp;#12;ï&#130;·   Portfolio projects often involving client country financial intermediaries, that may enable a wide&#13;
    range of renewable energy or energy efficiency technologies and projects implemented by the private&#13;
    sector, sometimes with many subprojects, each of which may be individually quite small. At the time&#13;
    of project appraisal, the economic analysis is necessarily limited to the evaluation of a sample of&#13;
    potential sub-projects (or subprojects identified in the pipeline for implementation in the first year of&#13;
    the project). Typical examples include the Turkey Private Sector Renewable Energy and Energy&#13;
    Efficiency Project; the Vietnam Renewable Energy Development Project or the Uganda Energy for&#13;
    Rural Transformation project. Many of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s transmission and distribution projects also involve&#13;
    large number of subprojects only some of which are in the project pipeline at time of project&#13;
    preparation. Part of the economistâ&#128;&#153;s role during project preparation is to set out the scope and form&#13;
    of economic analysis required during project implementation, typically implemented by project&#13;
    management units (PMUs).&#13;
ï&#130;·   Smaller projects and rehabilitation projects: while these may well require a more limited analysis,&#13;
    one should avoid the presumption that the economic analysis of small projects requires little serious&#13;
    attention. It is always difficult to set minimum thresholds for satisfactory analysis, but the&#13;
    spreadsheet snapshots provided in the Annex Volume provide guidance on what is minimally&#13;
    required for smaller projects.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Policy analysis: The Bank is increasingly involved in assisting its clients with power sector policy&#13;
    reforms, which invariably requires economic reasoning to ensure rational results. Many of the tools&#13;
    and techniques provided in the technical notes provide support for this kind of project, which often&#13;
    requires illustrative examples of the impact of reforms on the various stakeholders and of the&#13;
    financial and macroeconomic consequences (particularly in the demonstration of the economic costs&#13;
    and targeting performance of fuel subsidies, and the economic costs of non-technical and revenue&#13;
    collection losses in T&amp;D projects).&#13;
ï&#130;·   Small projects in small countries, in many cases associated with emergency projects requiring&#13;
    immediate implementation.4 For such projects the economic and financial analysis can be limited in&#13;
    scope, for the economic benefits of restoring power supply are so large that much detailed study may&#13;
    be deemed superfluous. But that does not mean a basic economic risk assessment is unnecessary:&#13;
    there are a number of examples of emergency power projects that have ended up as white elephants,5&#13;
    which might have been avoided had there been even a simple risk assessment-based scenario&#13;
    analysis.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Just as economic analysis as set out in the new OPSPQ guidelines reflects an iterative&#13;
role in the project definition and project preparation cycle, so is the analytical process an&#13;
iterative one. An economic analysis is rarely conducted as a one-time pass through a set of&#13;
proscribed steps, seriatim. Typically the economic analysis starts with a quick first pass&#13;
through all the steps in Figure 2.1, using whatever data as may be conveniently at hand, mainly&#13;
as a way of identifying data gaps: placeholders based on the experience of the analyst are often&#13;
indispensable. As noted by the OPSPQ guidelines, a first estimate of the economic returns&#13;
should already be prepared even before the PCN stage.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Often such a first pass will reveal economic returns that are too good to be true, or so&#13;
low that their acceptance implies abandonment of the project as proposed. In the first case the&#13;
economistâ&#128;&#153;s role is to bring realism to the table, in the second case it is to force attention to&#13;
revised project designs or consideration of alternatives better suited to achieving the project&#13;
objectives. There are many examples of seemingly good renewable energy projects (say a wind&#13;
project to replace diesel generation on a very windy island) but which on closer examination of&#13;
the realisable economic benefits prove to be at best marginal because the load is insufficient; or&#13;
because the load curve is such that night-time wind production cannot be absorbed (even with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4       Such as the Afghanistan Emergency Power Project (that included rehabilitation of the Naghlu hydro project)&#13;
        and the Burundi Emergency Power Project that included small hydro development (World Bank Report&#13;
        56454-BI)&#13;
5       For example, the 110 MW diesel power station constructed in 2008 by USAID on an emergency basis at&#13;
        Tarakhil, outside Kabul has almost never been used â&#128;&#147; in part because of problems of reliable supply of diesel&#13;
        fuel, in part because diesel fuel has been prohibitively expensive, and in part because relatively abundant&#13;
        imports of surplus power for Uzbekistan have been available at low cost. Such outcomes could easily have&#13;
        been anticipated in 2007/2008.&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                    5&#13;
&amp;#12;time-of-day tariffs to encourage night time use such as for ice-making for fishermen); or&#13;
because of the part-load inefficiency of diesels.&#13;
&#13;
11.     As the preparation of the economic analysis Annex to the Project Appraisal Document&#13;
(PAD) proceeds, it may be useful to evaluate its content against the Checklist of Table 2.1.&#13;
Many of the questions apply to all projects: others are specific to particular types of projects.&#13;
One may note that the answer to all of these questions is not necessarily â&#128;&#156;yesâ&#128;? â&#128;&#147; but whenever&#13;
the answer is â&#128;&#156;noâ&#128;?, then there should be a plausible answer as to why not.&#13;
&#13;
12.     The Technical Notes are organised in three sections:&#13;
      ï&#130;· Basic Concepts: applicable to all power sector projects (C1 to C8)&#13;
      ï&#130;· Technology related issues: In this first version of the guidelines, these relate just to&#13;
        renewable energy projects (T1 to T5). Subsequent versions will add additional notes&#13;
        on other types of power sector investment and policy projects.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Methodologies and techniques: providing guidance on specific techniques useful for&#13;
        economic analysis of power projects (such as Monte Carlo simulation, estimating&#13;
        demand curves, and mean-variance portfolio analysis). (M1 to M9).&#13;

      additional            job losses associated with thermal fuel generation, say in coal mining?) (C8)&#13;
      studies          ï&#130;·    If macroeconomic impacts are included in the analysis, are the arguments for&#13;
                            the establishment of local manufacturing, and the assignments of economic&#13;
                            benefit, plausible for the project under appraisal (C8)&#13;

POLICY ANALYSIS AND PROJECT APPRAISAL&#13;
13.      Although the emphasis of this Guidance is directed at the appraisal of investment&#13;
projects, the principles of economic reasoning apply to other types of projects encountered in&#13;
the Energy &amp; Extractives Global Practice. The Bank is increasingly being asked to provide&#13;
assistance to client Governments in formulating an improved policy environment to enable&#13;
private investment in the sector, and to provide development policy credits and loans&#13;
expressly tied to power sector reform. Moreover, the sustainability of investment projects is&#13;
often largely determined by the policy environment, and therefore the policy review (Step 2 of&#13;
Figure 2.1) must necessarily encompass a much broader canvas than just the details of a&#13;
particular proposed project. For this reason the Technical Notes include exposition of tools&#13;
relevant as much to policy evaluation as to project appraisal. 6 Table 2.2 summarises the main&#13;
applications.&#13;
&#13;
                               Table 2.2: Applications of economic analysis&#13;
Activity&#13;
Investment Project Appraisal     The main steps of which are outlined in Figure 2.1. A review of the&#13;
                                 policy background must necessarily precede consideration of a specific&#13;
                                 project.&#13;
Development Policy               These are typically tied to power sector reforms, and premised on a set of&#13;
Credit/Loan                      prior actions and policy reforms, whose economic and environmental&#13;
                                 impacts must be evaluated in the PAD. The analysis and evaluation of&#13;
                                 these prior actions rests largely on the same techniques as those presented&#13;
                                 in these Guidelines.&#13;
Technical Assistance for         Typical projects include assistance in drafting renewable energy tariffs (as&#13;
improving the policy             in Vietnam), or in improving regulation and reducing subsidies (such as&#13;
environment                      the introduction of performance based regulation to PLN in Indonesia),&#13;
                                 which provide the necessary enabling environment for larger investment&#13;
                                 projects in the sector. See Annex I (Additional Guidance for Renewable&#13;
                                 Energy Projects, Step 2) for a summary of the policy issues germane to&#13;
                                 renewable energy.&#13;
&#13;
6        For example, Technical Note M3 on Supply Curves informs the process of setting renewable energy targets&#13;
         and the design renewable energy support tariffs based on benefits.&#13;
September 2015                                                                                               7&#13;
&amp;#12;3.      THE STEPS OF A PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
______________________________________________________________________________&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.      THE RATIONALE&#13;
14.     The OPSPQ economic analysis guidelines call for the early involvement of the project&#13;
economist, whose first task is a quick reality check with whatever cost and benefit data as may&#13;
be at hand. How likely is the project to meet the required hurdle rate? What are the main data&#13;
gaps that need immediate clarification? And, especially important in the case of renewable&#13;
energy projects, what are the seasonal and daily patterns of the renewable energy resource in&#13;
question, for this will be one of the key determinants of potential benefits.&#13;
&#13;
15.     A presentation of the energy sector background is required of all PADs, which&#13;
generally develops the rationale for the proposed investment project or policy intervention.&#13;
However, clarity of objectives â&#128;&#147; that will largely determine the shape, form, and content of an&#13;
economic analysis â&#128;&#147; is not always assured. For example, some recent proposed T&amp;D projects&#13;
have included a component to introduce smart meters â&#128;&#147; but upon closer inspection, some of the&#13;
benefits demonstrated in developed countries (replace expensive manual meter reading) or&#13;
even in some developing countries (reduce very high non-technical and commercial losses - i.e.&#13;
pilferage - such as in India and Pakistan) do not really apply to other countries (for instance in&#13;
Vietnam, where both pilferage rates and labour costs are low).7 In the case of grid connected&#13;
renewable energy projects with high incremental costs, the importance of a clearly defined&#13;
rationale is paramount.&#13;
&#13;
16.      â&#128;&#156;Least costâ&#128;? deserves careful definition. Many utilities claim to use least cost planning&#13;
models which upon close inspection means least financial cost to the utility. The term as used in&#13;
these Guidelines means least economic cost including all local externalities, from the perspective&#13;
of the country. Global externalities (principally the damage costs of GHG emissions) should&#13;
always be considered separately in a CBA, because their impact is critically dependent upon&#13;
the valuation of the social cost of carbon, and because many of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s low and middle&#13;
income client Governments disagree that this should influence their investment decisions -&#13;
particularly when the valuation as proposed by the new World Bank guidance document on&#13;
the social cost of carbon is much higher than the developed countriesâ&#128;&#153; own willingness-to-pay&#13;
for carbon reductions (as evidenced by the current value in global carbon markets such as the&#13;
EU ETS).&#13;
&#13;
17.       The view taken in these Guidelines is that whatever carbon reduction targets as may be&#13;
set by Governments as a matter of policy, the task of the economic analysis is to ensure that this&#13;
target is achieved at least economic (social) cost. For example, the decision of the Government&#13;
of Indonesia to include in the evaluation of benefits of geothermal energy at $30/ton CO2&#13;
valuation for GHG emissions was essentially a political decision:8 the task of the economist is to&#13;
insist that this value applies equally to all renewable energy technologies (and their support&#13;
tariffs, and indeed to all power sector projects), and that the relevant question is how to meet&#13;
carbon reductions at least economic cost â&#128;&#147; which may well mean that energy efficiency or&#13;
thermal generation or distribution system rehabilitation should be preferred over some high&#13;
cost renewable energy projects. The extent to which so-called learning curve benefits accrue to&#13;
the countries now embarking on high cost renewable projects (as in the case of the CSP projects&#13;
in Morocco) is particularly contentious (and is discussed in Technical Note T3).&#13;
&#13;
7       See M. Madrigal and R. Uluski, Practical Guidance for Defining a Smart Grid Modernization Strategy: the Case of&#13;
        Distribution. World Bank Study, 2015.&#13;
8       It could be argued that this is not a political decision at all, but that $30/ton (or more) simply reflects the&#13;
        reality of global damage costs. But that ignores the other reality that it is the rich countries that are largely&#13;
        responsible for the GHG emissions problem, who became wealthy as a consequence of abundant low cost&#13;
        fossil energy, and that it is profoundly unfair to burden poor countries (and their consumers) with the cost of&#13;
        mitigation (particularly at a time when the carbon markets of the rich countries value carbon at $10/ton&#13;
        CO2).&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                        8&#13;
&amp;#12;2.      POLICY REVIEW&#13;
18.     Both OPSPQ and the Energy Directions Paper 9 stress the importance of the policy&#13;
framework that will ultimately determine the sustainability of a proposed project. The main&#13;
policy questions to be resolved for a project appraisal are as follows: is the policy (and tariff)&#13;
environment&#13;
  ï&#130;· Transparent: Bankability of project PPAs depends on the principles and calculation&#13;
    methodology of tariffs being understood by the various stakeholders. In the case of&#13;
    renewable energy projects, is there clarity about how the incremental costs are recovered?&#13;
  ï&#130;· Equitable: Many subsidies on electricity and fuels are poorly targeted, with a&#13;
    disproportionate share captured by the better off income groups (i.e., they are poorly&#13;
    targeted).10&#13;
  ï&#130;· Sustainable: Projects that rely upon tariff subsidies, or on thermal fuel subsidies, may not&#13;
    be sustainable, because the burdens of subsidies may themselves be unsustainable (and&#13;
    subject to rapid change). Renewable energy projects that depend on recovery of&#13;
    incremental costs from some â&#128;&#156;Fundâ&#128;? will be at risk if the funding of that â&#128;&#156;Fundâ&#128;? cannot be&#13;
    assured.&#13;
  ï&#130;· Efficient: Access to feed-in tariffs for renewable energy under first-come first served&#13;
    arrangements does not assure economic efficiency: unless transaction costs outweigh the&#13;
    benefits (which may be the case for small projects), competitive mechanisms should be&#13;
    sought. Consumer tariffs should reflect the economic cost of supply (and are ideally based&#13;
    on the long term marginal costs of supply at each voltage level of consumption).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.      METHODOLOGY&#13;
19.     With the rationale defined, one then identifies the main data requirements and the&#13;
methodology to be used. What are the main sources of information (e.g. utility capacity&#13;
expansion plan, a detailed feasibility study?) What is the approach for setting the counter-&#13;
factual? What externalities will be considered? What can be valued? What discount rate (or&#13;
range of discount rates) should be used and why? What subjects are worthy of separate&#13;
detailed assessment?&#13;
&#13;
20.      OPSPQ mandates the use of CBA as the principal tool of economic analysis for project&#13;
appraisal, though with some latitude to use cost-effectiveness analysis â&#128;&#147; in which one may not&#13;
be able to monetize all anticipated benefits or the alternatives considered, 11 and simply makes&#13;
comparisons of costs of alternatives to deliver â&#128;&#156;roughly simila r bundles of outcomes and&#13;
benefits.â&#128;? But where indeed there are project objectives beyond economic efficiency, so-called&#13;
multi-attribute decision analysis is a useful tool to illuminate the trade-offs among conflicting&#13;
objectives (Technical Note M6).&#13;
&#13;
Beyond CBA&#13;
21.     The performance of long-term energy infrastructure projects is sensitive to future&#13;
changes in energy prices, energy demand, technological innovation and climate change.&#13;
Making these projects resilient to long-term changes is challenged by the irreducible&#13;
uncertainty that surrounds future climate change and socio-economic developments. This has&#13;
resulted in an increasing demand for new methodologies that take this uncertainty into account&#13;
during the economic analysis of projects, and which places more emphasis on robustness than&#13;
on claimed optimality.&#13;

September 2015                                                                                                    9&#13;
&amp;#12;22.       The traditional approach to power systems modelling (and the related preparation of&#13;
so-called â&#128;&#156;Masterplansâ&#128;?), and the conventional approach to CBA, fall under a decision -making&#13;
paradigm often described as â&#128;&#156;predict then actâ&#128;?. The presumption is that given some set of&#13;
assumptions about the future (load forecasts, international energy prices) one can identify an&#13;
â&#128;&#156;optimalâ&#128;? investment plan to meet the objective, with optimality defined as least economic cost&#13;
(or in the case of a project appraisal, choose that alternative with the highest NPV &gt;0). In a&#13;
deterministic world, or one where most assumptions about the future were judged reasonably&#13;
certain (as they were in the years immediately following WW II when CBA evolved, i.e. before&#13;
the first oil crisis in 1973), this approach performed well.&#13;
&#13;
23.      But with the increasing levels of uncertainty that characterise the modern world,&#13;
traditional CBA â&#128;&#147; even when accompanied by the ensemble of ancillary tools of sensitivity&#13;
analysis and Monte Carlo Risk assessment - has run into difficulties. First, there may be&#13;
disagreement about forecasts of the future, or the discount rate used to trade-off current and&#13;
future consumption and saving, so decisions may be stalled because of lack of consensus.&#13;
Second, if the predicted future does not materialize, then what was thought to be optimal&#13;
(â&#128;&#156;least-costâ&#128;?) proves in reality to have been distinctly non-optimal. Moreover, many variables&#13;
are very difficult to forecast in probability terms (for example, how does one assign&#13;
probabilities to trajectories of future oil prices?)&#13;
&#13;
24.       Several methodologies to address these problems are being proposed, referred to collectively as&#13;
Decision Making under Uncertainty (DMU). These start with a different approach, namely to ask&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Which investment option best meets our goals given that we cannot know what the future will bring?â&#128;? 12&#13;
Such methods seek to identify robust decisions that satisfy decision makersâ&#128;&#153; objectives in many plausible&#13;
futures, rather than being optimal in any single best estimate of the future.13&#13;
&#13;
25.      These various approaches are discussed further in Technical Note C4, and include:&#13;
 ï&#130;· Robust decision-making: developed at the RAND corporation to inform policy choices under&#13;
    deep uncertainty and complexity (such as predicting the vulnerability of a project to future&#13;
    climate change impacts when there may even be disagreement about the validity of models&#13;
    that link outcomes to current actions).14 In the Bank literature, a good general introduction&#13;
    to RDM is Hallegatte and others. 15 RDM is being applied to several ongoing World Bank&#13;
    projects including power sector planning in Afghanistan, and hydropower investments in Nepal. 16&#13;
 ï&#130;· Real options: long used in the private sector to assess resource exploration, marketing and&#13;
    investment decisions under uncertainties that may require additional time or money to resolve&#13;
    (discussed further in Step 12,below).&#13;
 ï&#130;· Probabilistic Scenario Analysis: which derives the economic consequences of making non-optimal&#13;
    decisions, and highlights the relationship between the degree of risk-aversion of the decision-maker&#13;
    and the consequences of non-optimal choices (Technical Note C4 includes an example of setting&#13;
    targets for renewable energy).&#13;

4.      DATA&#13;
26.      In most cases, the main problem for the economist is not so much the technical and cost&#13;
details of the proposed project, but that of the counterfactual. For the proposed project,&#13;
detailed technical feasibility studies are often available, that present costs and performance&#13;
data in some detail â&#128;&#147; and, depending on the quality of the FS, also provide the rationale for the&#13;
particular project design alternatives considered (for example in a hydro project the dam axis,&#13;

&amp;#12;reservoir size, powerhouse configuration, determination of turbine sizes). Rather, the problem&#13;
lies in the specification of the counter-factual, for which much less information is generally&#13;
available (often because the alternative has not been of great interest to the project proponent).&#13;
&#13;
27.     One might have assumed that the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s unique and wide experience with power&#13;
sector projects (surely many hundreds over the past decade) would have led to a database&#13;
repository of power project data across generation types, geography, equipment source, with&#13;
costs and technical performance. Unfortunately, this has not been the case thus far (though&#13;
with the introduction of the global practice on energy and extractives, one may hope this be&#13;
done at some point in the future). But for the time being, the project economist is generally left&#13;
to his own devices to assemble cost and performance data for the set of technologies of interest.&#13;
The main sources can be summarised as follows:&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Fossil fuel generation costs:     NREL is a source of good information not just on&#13;
         renewable energy, but also on the thermal generation alternatives as well. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
         META tool contains data for a wide range of representative thermal technologies. The&#13;
         US Energy Information Administration (USEIA) website also provides good data of&#13;
         cost and performance of generation projects, but such generic estimates need care for&#13;
         application to developing countries (and often do not reflect the much lower costs of&#13;
         Chinese suppliers). Sadly, the EPRI Technical Assessment Guide that was for many&#13;
         years the standard reference in the US is no longer maintained.&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Renewable energy: the various reports by the International Renewable Energy Agency&#13;
         (IRENA) provide useful references for technology cost and performance trends The&#13;
         US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is another rich source of technical&#13;
         information. Some computer tools such as RETSCREEN and HOMER also include&#13;
         databases of valuable cost and technology information.&#13;
The main difficulty here is that especially in the case of renewable energy projects, costs are&#13;
highly site-specific (as in the case of large hydro costs), which generic estimates issued by&#13;
international agencies often do not reflect well. Technical Note C1 discusses data issues in&#13;
more detail: Table C1.7 presents an annotated list of sources that have proven useful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.       IDENTIFYING PROJECT COSTS&#13;
28.      Estimating the capital and O&amp;M costs of power sector projects is generally&#13;
straightforward (albeit subject to the usual uncertainties of cost escalation and delay).&#13;
However, several topics require special attention:&#13;
&#13;
The transparency of cost estimates&#13;
29.     The reconciliation of economic and financial costs needs to be transparent, clearly&#13;
identifying such financial costs as are excluded from the economic flows, and with a careful&#13;
breakdown of foreign and domestic costs, and what elements of costs are transfer costs to be&#13;
excluded from the economic flows. This is also an essential prerequisite for the distributional&#13;
analysis. A recommended format for the presentation of economic and financial costs is&#13;
presented in Table C1.12.&#13;
&#13;
The opportunity cost of consumptive water use.&#13;
30.     Most CBAs encountered in PADs simply assume the equivalence of opportunity cost of&#13;
water with its financial cost (which only rarely reflects the true cost, particularly in arid&#13;
countries). Indeed in many cases, consumptive water use is not separated out from general&#13;
O&amp;M costs.        The Medupi coal-fired generatoin project in South Africa illustrates the&#13;
importance of the need for a careful water balance. Even though the project uses dry cooling&#13;
(requiring relatively little make-up water compared to evaporative cooling), the FGD units to&#13;
be added later on are based on a wet process, requiring 11 million cubic metres of water per&#13;
year. Whether the financial price to ESKOM reflects the actual opportunity cost of water in an&#13;
arid part of the country is controversial: good practice demands that in all arid countries,&#13;
&#13;
September 2015                                                                                11&#13;
&amp;#12;consumptive water use and its economic cost be separately identified in the table of economic&#13;
flows.&#13;
&#13;
31.     Consumptive water use is also required for some renewable energy projects (such as&#13;
the CSP project in Morocco). Any consumptive water use associated with the displaced&#13;
thermal generation should also be accounted for (and whose avoidance constitutes an&#13;
additional benefit of renewable energy generation).&#13;
&#13;
32.      To establish a credible value for the economic cost of water may be difficult in the&#13;
absence of relevant detailed studies of the cost of developing municipal water supply or&#13;
irrigation. Whether such studies would need to be commissioned to support a CBA would&#13;
depend on a first round of sensitivity analysis â&#128;&#147; if an order of magnitude increase of the&#13;
financial water price (which generally is known) has a negligible impact on the economic&#13;
returns, more detailed study may not be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
Shadow pricing of other inputs17&#13;
33.      A review of current World Bank practice shows that relatively few power sector project&#13;
appraisals have shadow-priced domestic (non-traded) inputs and outputs. However, in ADB&#13;
practice labour inputs are frequently shadow priced. 18 Whether this is really worth doing&#13;
depends on whether the adjustments are reasonably well grounded (there are few reliable&#13;
studies of the labour composition of renewable energy project construction work force), and&#13;
what proportion of the capital cost is imported equipment. With the exception of hydro (where&#13;
significant construction labour for civil works are required), for most energy projects the labour&#13;
inputs in both construction and operation are relatively small. Technical Note M1 discusses&#13;
the need for adjustments to the exchange rate (using either the standard correction factor, SCF&#13;
or the shadow exchange rate, SER).&#13;
&#13;
Externalities&#13;
34.      What externalities will be considered? As noted, in the case of GHG emissions, the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s new Guidance Notes on both carbon accounting and the valuation of carbon are now in&#13;
place.19 But for local air emission damage costs, impacts on downstream fisheries, or valuation&#13;
of lost forestry, there is much scope for judgement. What non-use values should be included,&#13;
and how should they be quantified? Technical Note C3 includes a checklist of externalities&#13;
(both positive and negative) that generally apply to different kinds of power sector projects,&#13;
and provides examples of their assessment and monetisation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.      IDENTIFYING PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
Valuation of fossil fuels&#13;
35.     Correct valuation of fossil fuels is fundamental to almost every type of power sector&#13;
project&#13;
 ï&#130;· Generation projects: the cost of fossil fuel is often the largest single cost item (in NPV terms).&#13;
 ï&#130;· T&amp;D projects: technical loss reduction is often an important component of benefits, which&#13;
    translates to avoided consumption of thermal fuels.&#13;
 ï&#130;· Renewable energy projects: the avoided cost of fossil fuel is the principal economic benefit of a&#13;
    RE project.&#13;
 ï&#130;· Energy Efficiency: whether these displace oil and coal, or electricity that (at the margin) will&#13;
    indirectly displace thermal fuels, correct valuation is again critical.&#13;
&#13;
17      The best non-technical explanation of shadow pricing is still that in Chapter 12 of R. Turvey and Dennis&#13;
        Anderson, Electricity Economics: Essays and Case Studies, Johns Hopkins for the World Bank, 1977 (â&#128;&#156;A&#13;
        Laymanâ&#128;&#153;s Guide to Shadow Pricingâ&#128;?).&#13;
18      In all of the ADB projects reviewed, unskilled labor inputs are adjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 85%,&#13;
        but the source of this adjustment is unclear.&#13;
19      World Bank, 2015. Guidance Note: Greenhouse Gas Accounting for Energy Investment Operations: Transmission &amp;&#13;
        Distribution Projects, Power Generation Projects and Energy Efficiency Projects, Version 2, January 2015.&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                   12&#13;
&amp;#12;     ï&#130;· Rural electrification: access to the grid may increase thermal generation in the grid, but will&#13;
       be offset by lower use of kerosene for lighting and diesel for self-generation: both are often&#13;
       subsidised, so these displaced fuels should be valued at their economic price, not their&#13;
       financial price (with the necessary reconciliation of economic and financial costs presented&#13;
       in the distributional analysis).&#13;
&#13;
36.     Where fossil fuels are imported there are few issues, the relevant economic cost being&#13;
the border price at the point of import (on a cif basis). 20 More difficult is the appropriate&#13;
valuation in the case of countries that produce their own thermal fuels (or are even fuel&#13;
exporting countries).&#13;
&#13;
37.      In some countries the price regime for domestic fuel has been aligned to international&#13;
price levels (such as coal pricing to the Indonesian power company PLN). But in others,&#13;
domestic fuel prices for power generation still remain subsidised (gas in Egypt, coal in Vietnam&#13;
and South Africa). The problem of valuation is also complex in cases where high quality coal&#13;
is exported (at a well documented price), but the domestic market uses low quality coal which&#13;
has no export market â&#128;&#147; in which case the opportunity cost of coal used for domestic power&#13;
generation is much lower than the international price. And even where a fuel is exported&#13;
(such as gas exports from Egypt to Jordan), the negotiated price often reflects other foreign&#13;
policy objectives, so the stated border price may not necessarily reflect the real opportunity cost&#13;
of the resource in question.&#13;
&#13;
38.      Technical Note C1 offers guidance for the proper valuation of the opportunity costs of&#13;
thermal fuels, and shows examples of appropriate netback calculations to establish import&#13;
parity prices. Even where a least cost planning model is in place, it is sometimes run by the&#13;
utility using financial prices, so the input assumptions need careful review by the economist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.         ALTERNATIVES&#13;
39.      The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s guidelines require the consideration of a â&#128;&#156;no projectâ&#128;? alternative. The idea&#13;
of â&#128;&#156;no projectâ&#128;? is sometimes derided as unrealistic, because in face of increasing electricity&#13;
demands associated with economic development, not building any additional generation&#13;
projects is simply not plausible. Yet the fact remains that many countries are indeed facing&#13;
severe power shortages because insufficient capacity has been added. And it is also true that&#13;
many countries have very high T&amp;D losses, mitigation of which may well have higher returns&#13;
than building new supply. These issues are often discussed at some length in the project&#13;
justification and sector context sections of a PAD, but the question remains on whether and&#13;
how these issues should also be treated in the economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
40.      For most projects there exists a hierarchy of alternatives, illustrated for a hydro project&#13;
as follows:&#13;
         ï&#130;· Alternatives to supply side expansion (DSM, T&amp;D loss reduction)?&#13;
         ï&#130;· Alternatives for peaking power additions (why hydro and not CCGT? or&#13;
           coal+pumped storage?)&#13;
         ï&#130;· Other renewable energy alternatives (why hydro and not wind or geothermal?)&#13;
         ï&#130;· Alternative hydro projects - given a set of candidate hydro projects, why this&#13;
           particular project?&#13;
         ï&#130;· For the specific project proposed, alternative sites, reservoir sizes, dam axes, and&#13;
           installed capacity alternatives.&#13;
&#13;
41.     For large projects with a detailed Feasibility Study (FS) already in place or underway,&#13;
some of this analysis would often already have been done by the time Government requests&#13;
assistance from the Bank, and upon which the economic analysis can draw. But for many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20         These may need to be adjusted for transportation differentials to derive the so-called import parity price&#13;
           (explained in Technical Note C1).&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                   13&#13;
&amp;#12;smaller projects such questions will often remain to be assessed, and will fall on the project&#13;
economist to answer during preparation of the PAD.&#13;
&#13;
42.    Comparisons of levelised cost of energy (LCOR) should be used with caution:&#13;
geothermal and coal, both delivering base load power, can be validly compared in a simple&#13;
LCOE analysis; but coal and wind, or coal and gas-fired combustion turbines can not (see&#13;
Technical Note C1).&#13;
&#13;
The counter-factual&#13;
43.      The best-counterfactual for a grid-connected power generation project is developed&#13;
with the assistance of a generation expansion planning model â&#128;&#147; which should be run with and&#13;
without the proposed project. This is a practical approach only where a countryâ&#128;&#153;s utility&#13;
already has the capacity to have run such models for some years. But not all countries have a&#13;
WASP model (or equivalent) in place, and some that do may yet require help to run the model&#13;
for the particular purpose of a project CBA. Moreover it is not always clear whether such&#13;
models have the ability to properly account for renewable energy variability (whether over&#13;
very short time intervals, seasonal, or even inter-annual variations).21 Furthermore, the&#13;
sequence of large hydro projects is often forced exogenously into such models according to the&#13;
state of readiness, rather than in order of economic merit.&#13;
&#13;
44.     The main challenge is how to construct a credible counter-factual when such a model is&#13;
not available. This is crucial where avoided carbon emissions of the thermal alternative are to&#13;
be considered: it matters greatly whether it is coal, oil or gas â&#128;&#147; or indeed some mix of all of&#13;
them â&#128;&#147; are displaced. Technical Note T4 discusses further the problems of selecting an&#13;
appropriate counter-factual for renewable energy technologies.&#13;
&#13;
45.      The most difficult counter-factual is for generation rehabilitation projects. Predicting&#13;
alternative futures for an existing plant in serious decline is subject to high uncertainty (for&#13;
example, how much can conditions degrade before the plant would be abandoned completely;&#13;
or in the case of a hydro project, how soon would the active storage be degraded by sediment&#13;
in the absence of proper sediment management practice?). Setting up the â&#128;&#156;no projectâ&#128;?&#13;
alternative requires detailed consultation with the relevant engineering experts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.      THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
46.      Just as the financial analysis included in PADs follows a standard format (following&#13;
the conventions of financial accountancy), the economic analysis should follow a standard form&#13;
for the summary presentation of the baseline economic analysis which should be included in&#13;
the main text of the PAD in the appraisal summary section. This may usefully follow the format&#13;
presented in the PAD of the Noor CSP project (Table 3.1): here the choice of discount rate was&#13;
one of the main issues - in other projects the columns may represent a different set of important&#13;
alternative parameters for the calculation of economic returns. This format displays the major&#13;
components of costs and benefits, and the calculations of ERR and NPV are presented&#13;
         ï&#130;· without externalities&#13;
         ï&#130;· with avoided local externalities&#13;
         ï&#130;· with avoided local + global externalities&#13;
&#13;
      Table 3.1: Summary of economic analysis for a CSP project (from the Noor II&amp;III PAD) 22&#13;
                                                                                     Govt.           ONE&#13;
                                                                               opportunity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21      For example, many countries have experienced significant inter-annual variations in annual average wind&#13;
        speeds (in both China and India, as well in Northwestern Europe, significant decreases in annual wind&#13;
        speeds have been observed - and their cause or whether these are part of some natural long-term cycle still&#13;
        remains a matter of research).&#13;
22      In this example, the calculation of the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s opportunity cost of capital was based on the interest&#13;
        rates of recent Euro and US$ bond issuances: of course not all countries have such a track record of&#13;
        successful bond sales as guidance.&#13;

&#13;
Minimum requirements&#13;
47.     Particularly in the case of small projects, the question of what constitutes an acceptable&#13;
analysis arises frequently. To this end we provide in the Annex Volume a set of tables that&#13;
describe what is minimally acceptable. We note that the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s new carbon accounting&#13;
guidelines apply to all projects, which necessarily requires all power sector projects enumerate&#13;
the types of thermal energy that is generated or saved. The following tables should be&#13;
provided in all economic analysis of power projects, each showing annual values over the&#13;
expected economic lifetime.&#13;
ï&#130;· Macroeconomic assumptions, including forecasts of future border prices for thermal&#13;
    generation fuels, inflation, exchange rates, GDP growth (relevant for health damage cost&#13;
    assessment)&#13;
ï&#130;· Electricity Balances, that display the flow of energy through all of the affected parts of the&#13;
    system, and account for own-use, T&amp;D losses and the type of thermal generation that is&#13;
    avoided or added. In the case of T&amp;D projects, these balances need to be prepared with&#13;
    and without the proposed intervention for a reliable calculation of the net impacts.&#13;
ï&#130;· Calculation of economic returns, with an enumeration of each of the major economic&#13;
    flows, in sufficient detail to permit preparation of the summary table shown in Table 3.1.&#13;
ï&#130;· Carbon accounting table: with sufficient detail to achieve a reliable calculation of lifetime&#13;
    and yearly emissions from each of the different types and sources of fossil fuels&#13;
    avoided/added.&#13;
ï&#130;· Calculation of economic returns including externalities: estimates of economic returns&#13;
    using the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s guidelines for the social cost of carbon is now required for all energy&#13;
    sector projects. Any project involving coal generation (including renewable energy&#13;
    projects that displace coal) should also include an estimate of local environmental damage&#13;
    costs (added or avoided).&#13;
&#13;
Capacity credit&#13;
48.      The question of capacity benefits arise in a wide variety of power sector projects. That a&#13;
T&amp;D loss reduction or energy efficiency project avoids energy losses is uncontroversial, but the&#13;
extent to which it also avoids capacity costs is more difficult to answer. For example, an energy&#13;
efficiency project may install waste heat recovery for power generation to meet power needs&#13;
previously supplied by the grid. At the margin, the grid supplier will avoid the variable&#13;
September 2015                                                                                             15&#13;
&amp;#12;generation costs of the most expensive units. But whether the supplier avoids capacity costs&#13;
will depend on the way in which the unit is operated (and avoided generation capacity may&#13;
not necessarily also avoid transmission capacity costs).&#13;
&#13;
49.     Among renewable energy projects, if provided with thermal storage CSP is among the&#13;
renewable energy technologies that command a significant capacity credit (in the case shown in&#13;
Table 3.1, the capacity credit accounts for some 20% of the total benefit). The same is true of&#13;
geothermal projects that have typical load factors of 90%, and often displace baseload coal&#13;
generation.23 But for other renewable energy technologies, the claim of capacity credit is more&#13;
controversial and requires careful consideration, particularly in light of much greater seasonal&#13;
variation of wind speeds than is experienced in the US and Europe (see Technical Note T1).&#13;
&#13;
Discount rates&#13;
50.      The choice of discount rate in the calculation of economic returns is critical, but has&#13;
become increasingly controversial in connection with the climate change debate and the&#13;
estimation of the damage costs of GHG emissions. For some time, in the absence of country-&#13;
specific studies on the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCK), or a Government directive&#13;
to use some specific rate, the Bank has been using 10-12% as a default. Most countries that run&#13;
power sector capacity expansion models use similar discount rates. This default has been&#13;
criticised on two grounds; first, that it discriminates against projects that have long and even&#13;
inter-generational benefits, and secondly that in fact the real cost of capital is much lower today&#13;
(and in the foreseeable future) than was the case in the 1980s and 1990s. The Bank has now&#13;
taken up this problem, and plans to issue new bank-wide guidance on discount rates in the&#13;
very near future. 24&#13;
&#13;
Decision-criteria&#13;
51.     Many decision criteria have been proposed for CBA:&#13;
ï&#130;· The economic rate of return (ERR) (project is economic if ERR&gt;economic opportunity cost&#13;
    of capital, EOCK)&#13;
ï&#130;· Net present value (NPV) (project is economic if NPV at EOCK &gt;0)&#13;
ï&#130;· Benefit-cost ratio (project is economic if &gt;1)&#13;
ï&#130;· Payback period&#13;
The first three of these are often taken as equivalent and particularly so for NPV and ERR. But&#13;
they are not in fact so.&#13;
&#13;
52.      The rate of return is defective as a measure of the relative merit of mutually exclusive&#13;
projects: a higher rate of return does not necessarily indicate a superior alternative as measured&#13;
by the size of the surplus when costs and benefits are discounted at the shadow rate of interest.&#13;
For this reason, World Bank practice is to use NPV as the main decision criterion. An&#13;
additional issue that when there is more than one reversal of sign in the net annual flows, the&#13;
ERR calculation may have multiple solutions. 25 Nevertheless, the (internal) rate of economic&#13;
return is a widely understood concept and serves as a compact summary measure of economic&#13;
merit. Consequently the World Bank PADs report both ERR and NPV.26&#13;
&#13;
53.     ERR should be especially avoided in any ranking exercise â&#128;&#147; say for an on-lending&#13;
operation to support multiple small hydro projects. In such cases the choice should be made&#13;
on the basis of maximizing the total NPV given the capital constraint, which rarely provides&#13;
&#13;
23      Among renewable energy technologies, some daily-peaking small hydro and some biomass projects can also&#13;
        credibly claim a capacity credit.&#13;
24      Once this bank-wide discount rate guidance note has been issued, the planned Technical Note C8 on&#13;
        discount rates for power sector projects will be issued.&#13;
25      Normally there is just one sign reversal â&#128;&#147; negative flows in the early years reflecting investment, positive&#13;
        once the project is in operation. But some projects may require large additional expenditures during the&#13;
        operating period (e.g., in the case of a hydro project, turbine runner replacement) that may cause a negative&#13;
        net economic flow in some years.&#13;
26      ADB practice is different. Many of the renewable energy project appraisals reviewed report only the ERR.&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                     16&#13;
&amp;#12;the same subproject selection as given by choosing the first n projects from a list ranked by&#13;
ERR. Benefit cost ratios are similarly misleading, as are traditional business indicators such as&#13;
payback period: both are incorrect indicators of economic profitability.27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9.      FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
54.     Traditional World Bank practice has been for the project economic analysis to be&#13;
accompanied by a so-called â&#128;&#156;projectâ&#128;? financial analysis, with the calculation of a project FIRR.&#13;
Taxes and duties and other transfer payments excluded to derive economic costs are added&#13;
back in, and the resulting financial return compared to the weighted average cost of capital&#13;
(WACC). If FIRR&gt;WACC, a project is deemed financially feasible. Both the FIRR and the&#13;
WACC were calculated at constant prices.&#13;
&#13;
55.      This may have been useful when almost all power sector projects were in the hands of&#13;
a vertically integrated, state-owned utility, and where, in effect, financing was on the balance&#13;
sheet of this entity, and for which a utility-wide WACC calculation was relevant. It has also&#13;
been argued that this avoids setting out the details of financing which may not be fully known&#13;
at the time of project appraisal. Thus much of the emphasis in financial analysis of traditional&#13;
power sector projects was on the financial condition of the borrower: in reality the project FIRR&#13;
at constant prices commanded little attention.&#13;
&#13;
56.      This approach has diminishing relevance today. Many power sector projects are&#13;
implemented as Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs), whose financing is essentially on a project&#13;
finance basis, and whose financial acceptability to private investors is based on actual expected&#13;
and nominal cash flows. The financial structure of such projects is integral to the special&#13;
purpose vehicles (SPVs) that are created to develop and implement projects. In any event, the&#13;
WACC calculation does not take into account loan tenors which is central to the determination&#13;
of cash flows, and to the debt service cover ratio (DSCR).&#13;
&#13;
57.      In the absence of an explicit understanding of the impact of project financing on cash&#13;
flows, it is very difficult to see how the OPSPQ requirement that the economic analysis assess&#13;
the financial sustainability of a project can be reliably provided by the traditional approach.&#13;
Indeed, the project financial return at constant prices provides no useful information about&#13;
actual likely project cash flows, and the crucial relationship between tariffs (and their&#13;
adjustments) and debt service cash requirements. Moreover, in portfolio projects involving on-&#13;
lending to commercial banks (or even to subproject borrowers), credible assessment of FOREX&#13;
risks (especially on concessionary loans with very long tenors) is impossible in the framework&#13;
of the traditional project FIRR approach.&#13;
&#13;
58.     A good economic analysis provides a reconciliation of economic and financial flows,&#13;
which is a prerequisite for a distributional analysis that identifies the impacts on the main&#13;
stakeholders. Thus a good economic analysis model will be linked to a financial model: since&#13;
many assumptions are common to both, it greatly eases a transparent reconciliation of&#13;
economic and financial flows. Nowhere is such a reconciliation and consistency more&#13;
important than in rural electrification and off-grid renewable projects, where the economic&#13;
benefits of household electrification are derived from the financial prices experienced by&#13;
consumers: the kerosene that is replaced by grid electricity is often subsidised, so a substantial&#13;
economic impact derives from the avoidance of deadweight losses associated with the&#13;
elimination of such subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.     DISTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
59.     The point of a distributional analysis is to quantify the impact of a project on the&#13;
stakeholders, among which there will be winners and losers. This is a particularly important&#13;
&#13;
27      L. Squire and H. van der Tak, 1975. Economic Analysis of Projects. Johns Hopkins University Press for the&#13;
        World Bank, Washington DC&#13;
September 2015                                                                                               17&#13;
&amp;#12;question for high cost renewable energy projects: who bears the incremental financial costs is&#13;
the central question. With many renewable energy projects involving highly concessionary&#13;
finance (such as CTF) and on-lending operations, identification of exactly who benefits from&#13;
such financing, and by how much, is critical to long-term sustainability: the risk is always that&#13;
at some point, Government decides it can no longer afford the subsidy to a high-cost project.&#13;
Technical Note C6 offers suggestions on how the distributional analysis can be presented, and&#13;
how to cross the bridge between the baseline economic analysis at constant prices, and a&#13;
financial analysis that is at nominal prices.&#13;
&#13;
60.      One of the reasons for the lack of good distributional analysis is that economic and&#13;
financial analyses are often conducted as separate studies, and often by different individuals: a&#13;
financial analyst prepares the project financials, and an economist prepares the assessment of&#13;
economic returns. Yet distributional analysis requires the reconciliation of economic and&#13;
financial flows because the stakeholders perceive the impact as financial. In a power sector&#13;
often riddled with subsidies, there also arise deadweight losses, which constitute economic&#13;
costs no less than consumer surplus constitutes an economic benefit. A plausible counter-&#13;
factual is another essential prerequisite for a good distributional analysis: what matters is the&#13;
net impact of the project on the stakeholders, relative to the counterfactual.&#13;
&#13;
61.       The transparent recovery of incremental costs lies at the heart of whether a support&#13;
tariff for renewable energy can be successful. There are many examples of countries setting up&#13;
â&#128;&#156;renewable energy fundsâ&#128;? that do not have a credible source of long term funding (â&#128;&#156;Funds&#13;
without fundsâ&#128;?), or renewable energy tariffs that are either excessively generous or set at a&#13;
level so low as not to enable any projects. The special problems of the financial sustainability&#13;
of renewable energy projects are discussed in Annex I.&#13;
&#13;
CBA and poverty alleviation.&#13;
62.     The question of the extent to which traditional analytical practice in CBA reflects&#13;
equity concerns is not new: already the 1975 World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s classic textbook on project economic&#13;
analysis proposed the use of distribution weights in CBA to reflect equity concerns. 28&#13;
&#13;
63.      Many large power sector projects (and hydro projects in particular) are located in&#13;
relatively remote rural areas, and the directly affected families who may require resettlement,&#13;
or whose livelihoods are affected, are often among a countryâ&#128;&#153;s poorest inhabitants. Estimating&#13;
the costs of R&amp;R as provided by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s safeguards policies is generally straightforward,&#13;
and easily incorporated as a line item in the table of economic flows. Under the presumption&#13;
that project affected persons (PAFs) are completely compensated by the project, the net impact&#13;
on PAFs would be zero. However, some social mitigation plans seek not just to compensate&#13;
PAFs, but improve their standard of living: even if described as â&#128;&#156;benefit sharing,â&#128;? such&#13;
additional improvements constitute a transfer payment and should not be treated as a project&#13;
(economic) cost.29&#13;
&#13;
64.      Recently, CGE models are coming into use for Poverty and Social Impact Assessment&#13;
(PSIA) to assess the welfare impacts of larger energy projects (including Development Policy&#13;
Loans tied to power sector reform).30 The economist charged with the CBA should consult&#13;
with the PSIA economist to ensure consistency of assumptions, and to ensure that any&#13;
significant welfare impacts on households are captured in the distributional analysis.&#13;

29      The 4,600 MW Dasu hydro project in Pakistan (on the Indus River, above the Tarbela project) is a case in&#13;
        point. Some 4,000 persons are planned to be relocated, but the budget cost estimate for the Social Mitigation&#13;
        Plan (SMP) is $470 million (or more than $100,000 per person!) How much of this survives the final project&#13;
        implementation remains to be seen, but the Dasu SMP stresses the commitment not just to compensation, but&#13;
        to achieving an improvement of the socio-economic well-being of those affected by the project.&#13;

&amp;#12;Project type         Issues&#13;
Grid-connected       In most cases consumers will experience little change in tariff from even expensive&#13;
renewable energy     renewable energy projects at the penetration levels expected in the early years of&#13;
                     increased renewable energy generation: such projects can hardly make a credible&#13;
                     claim to benefit low income groups (or any particular set of consumers).&#13;
                     However, there may arise significant equity considerations in the recovery of&#13;
                     incremental costs. In Malaysia, the incremental costs of the renewable energy FIT&#13;
                     are recovered by a 1% levy on all electricity customers who consume more than&#13;
                     300kWh/month, or whose bills exceed 37 Ringgit/month ($10.60), thereby shielding&#13;
                     lower income consumers.31 Who bears such incremental costs is best assessed in the&#13;
                     distributional analysis.&#13;
Rural                Invariably such projects disproportionately benefit lower income consumers that&#13;
electrification&amp;     predominate in rural areas. How such benefits of electrification are evaluated raises&#13;
off-grid             many issues, addressed in Technical Note M2.&#13;
renewable energy&#13;
Generation           If a new generation project is deemed to have incremental benefits, then (as in off-&#13;
projects             grid projects), the power benefits accrue to the extant mix of consumers. The extent&#13;
                     to which these include the poorer sections of society would need a case by case&#13;
                     evaluation. In the Tarbela T4 hydro project, which was designed primarily to&#13;
                     alleviate summer power shortages, the main benefits would accrue to agricultural&#13;
                     users (who would switch from diesel pump-sets to grid power). However, pump&#13;
                     sets tend to be owned by the better-off farmers rather than the rural poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.     SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
65.      Notwithstanding the guidance of the existing Handbook on Economic Analysis that calls&#13;
for calculation and discussion of switching values, in many economic analyses sensitivity&#13;
analysis is limited to recalculations of ERR/NPV for a few input variables by some fixed&#13;
percentage. Such an approach is unacceptable. Calculation of switching values is required for&#13;
all projects. Technical Note M1 describes the recommended approach for the presentation of&#13;
an adequate sensitivity analysis.&#13;
&#13;
66.      As noted above, one of the main issues for project appraisal is the extent to which the&#13;
risks of a project should be considered in the investment decision. Even if measures are taken&#13;
to mitigate some of the enumerated risks (and their costs of mitigation included as project&#13;
costs), substantial uncertainty over factors beyond the control of implementing agencies and&#13;
EPC contractors will remain. Some are related to natural resource variability (such as wind&#13;
and hydrology); others are related to the state of the global economy and world energy&#13;
markets. Some of these uncertainties about the future are best handled in a scenario analysis;&#13;
others are best illuminated by an explicit assessment of the trade-off between risk and returns â&#128;&#147;&#13;
as discussed in Technical Note C5.&#13;
&#13;
67.      The discussion of consumptive water use (in Step 5) illustrates the role of sensitivity&#13;
analysis in identifying how the resources available for economic analysis are best spent, and in&#13;
identifying the need for more detailed study to firm up key costs and benefits. As noted there,&#13;
the need for detailed study of the opportunity cost of water in an arid country will depend on&#13;
the sensitivity of the economic returns to the value of that assumption. If the switching value&#13;
indicates that hurdle rate would not be met if the economic cost of water were 100 times the&#13;
financial cost, then further study is not required: if it is twice the financial cost then further&#13;
investigation would be required, For thermal generation projects that may lead to a decision to&#13;
use dry cooling rather than evaporative cooling - and illustrates the role of economic analysis&#13;
in project design just as the OPSPQ guideline suggests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
31      By contrast, in Germany until very recently it has been the largest industrial consumers who have been&#13;
        exempt from the surcharge to recover the costs of the FIT. In 2012, German residential customers paid&#13;
        $0.25/kWh for electricity, of which the surcharge for the feed-in tariff levy accounted for $0.039/kWh, or&#13;
        13.9% of the average bill. This surcharge rose to $0.0528/kWh in 2013. (K. Neuhoff and others, 2013.&#13;
        Distributional Effects of Energy Transition: Impacts of Renewable Electricity Support in Germany . Economics of&#13;
        Energy &amp; Environmental Policy, Volume 2,No.1, March).&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                    19&#13;
&amp;#12;12.     RISK ASSESSMENT&#13;
68.     In recent years, project risks have been summarised in a PAD risk matrix. But few&#13;
PADs have made much effort to coordinate the economic analysis with the risks and their&#13;
mitigation as enumerated in this matrix. The converse is also true: it is rare for the PAD risk&#13;
matrix to refer to the results of the economic analysis risk assessment.&#13;
&#13;
69.    For example, the risk of delay and cost overruns is often identified in the risk matrix,&#13;
but nevertheless the economic analysis is silent on the subject. Not all risks can be quantified&#13;
and monetised, but those that can â&#128;&#147; and delay and construction cost overruns are certainly&#13;
among these â&#128;&#147; always deserve examination in the economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
70.     Indeed, one of the practical reasons that the OPSPQ guidelines call for the involvement&#13;
of the project economist already at the PCN stage is to make sure that the design of the project&#13;
benefits from the results of at least a preliminary economic analysis. The main point of the&#13;
economic analysis risk assessment is to prioritise and focus risk mitigation measures to ensure&#13;
the robustness of the economic returns. A well structured project preparation effort requires&#13;
the TTL (generally responsible for the preparation of the PAD risk matrix) and the project&#13;
economist to inform each other.&#13;
&#13;
71.      In its assessment of CBA at the Bank, IEG argues that "variability of a project's expected&#13;
NPV around its mean should not carry weight in decisions". This view goes back to the Bank's&#13;
traditional public sector lending to governments, who are assumed to wish to maximize the&#13;
expected NPV of their portfolio of projects (i.e., they are presumed to be risk neutral).32 IEG&#13;
takes the view that risk assessment is relevant mainly for the identification of mitigation&#13;
strategies. However, to use an illustrative example, suppose the best ranked alternative A has&#13;
an expected NPV (net benefits) of $500m, with variance $150m (say as revealed by a Monte&#13;
Carlo simulation of the probability distribution of NPV/ERR), but the second ranked option B&#13;
has an expected value of NPV of $490 million with a variance of $50million. Risk neutrality&#13;
would dictate that A be chosen, rather than B that has a lower NPV but which is more robust&#13;
with respect to exogenous uncertainties.33&#13;
&#13;
72.     The presumption of risk neutrality may well apply in some instances, and may be&#13;
appropriate for Bank projects considering portfolios of small to medium sized sub-projects&#13;
(often encountered in on-lending operations). But in the case of large power projects this may&#13;
not be the case. Indeed, with the World Bank increasingly involved in public-private&#13;
partnerships (PPP), and particularly so for larger hydro and renewable energy projects, the&#13;
private sector's evaluation of project risks is rarely risk neutral. International private power&#13;
developers may well have a portfolio of projects under development in different countries, and&#13;
may well be primarily concerned with the performance of their total portfolio. However&#13;
individual projects are still subjected to intense scrutiny and requirements to ensure equity&#13;
returns appropriate to risks at each stage of project development. Technical Note C5 (risk&#13;
analysis) discusses further the treatment of risk in project appraisal, and the use of tools&#13;
derived from financial portfolio management to assist in both policy analysis and project&#13;
evaluation (Technical Note M8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
32      The full discussion is to be found on p.98 of the Handbook.&#13;
33      Exogenous uncertainties are those which are outside the control of the Government and not amenable to&#13;
        mitigation at the project level â&#128;&#147; such as the future world oil price or the extent of climate change (that will&#13;
        largely be determined by the worldâ&#128;&#153;s big carbon emitters, not the typical small developing country that&#13;
        account for most of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s clients).&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                     20&#13;
&amp;#12;Real options34&#13;
73.      One approach to deal with uncertainty and its resolution is the application of so-called&#13;
real options (developed originally for financial markets). A real option is the right, but not the&#13;
obligation, to invest in a future project of unknown benefit at a known cost today. Just like&#13;
buying a plot of land gives you the right (but not obligation) to erect a building in the future, a&#13;
real option implies at least two time steps â&#128;&#147; a decision to be made today, followed by a decision&#13;
to be made tomorrow. 35&#13;
&#13;
74.      There are several necessary conditions for the real option value approach to be&#13;
suitable: uncertainty, learning and flexibility â&#128;&#147; which we can illustrate in the case of a hydro&#13;
project for which the commissioning of a detailed feasibility study (FS) is an example: 36&#13;
    ï&#130;· Uncertainty: without which there is no need to consider the possibility of deferring an&#13;
         investment decision: if the future is already known the best decision under certainty&#13;
         can be made now. But one does not start dam construction before the major&#13;
         geotechnical , hydrology and environmental uncertainties have been resolved.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Learning: information regarding uncertainty must change over time. The FS&#13;
         represents that learning. If it is unlikely that uncertainties will be resolved over time,&#13;
         then one might as well make a decision today. 37&#13;
    ï&#130;· Flexibility: if the FS shows that the hydro project will be uneconomic (or technically&#13;
         infeasible), one must be prepared not to proceed, or to delay a the investment pending&#13;
         resolution or narrowing of uncertainty over time.&#13;
&#13;
75.    Technical Note C4 provides a more detailed discussion of these alternative decision-&#13;
making frameworks.38 In the past decade a number of transmission planning and investment&#13;
problems in the developed countries have been cast as real options. 39&#13;
&#13;
76.     At this point in the analysis it should become clear under what circumstances the&#13;
economic returns of a proposed energy project meet the hurdle rate. Under the current&#13;
guidelines this means that when all relevant externalities have been quantified and monetized,&#13;
including GHG emissions (or their avoidance) at the values now set for project appraisal, the&#13;
hurdle rate is achieved.&#13;
&#13;
Scenario analysis&#13;
77.     As an adjunct to a Monte Carlo simulation one may conduct a scenario analysis which&#13;
compares plausible worst cases â&#128;&#147; in which all the input assumptions take on pessimistic values&#13;
together - against the baseline. This addresses the concerns of the IEG CBA evaluation that&#13;
analysts are prone to selecting what are judged to be the most likely values for all input&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
34      There are many good texts. T. Copeland and V. Antikarov, Real Options: A Practitionerâ&#128;&#153;s Guide, Texere, New&#13;
        York, 2001 is one of them.&#13;

        Uncertainty: Application to Climate Change, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 6193.&#13;
36      One may note that a FS for a large hydro project runs into the millions of dollars. That means that even&#13;
        before one embarks on a FS, one should ask what the FS would need to say about capital costs for the hydro&#13;
        project to be competitive with other thermal peaking options. If a hydro project would have to cost less than&#13;
        $1,000/kW to be competitive with gas or imports, why spend $5million for an outcome that seems most&#13;
        improbable?&#13;
37      Even with the benefits of a FS, however, not all geotechnical problems can be resolved â&#128;&#147; there are several&#13;
        examples of dam axes being changed once construction started, and foundation and geological fault&#13;
        conditions verified. Similarly, notwithstanding that commercial lenders often insist they take no tunneling&#13;
        risk (which means that the costs of unexpected conditions must be covered by equity), depending on terrain&#13;
        it may be judged uneconomic to confirm by drilling at the FS stage the actual rock conditions deep&#13;
        underground. A FS can never eliminate all uncertainty.&#13;

&amp;#12;variables, presuming a future that is rarely realised, with the result that economic returns are&#13;
often over-estimated.40&#13;
&#13;
78.      Such a scenario analysis may need several iterations with inputs from the team (and&#13;
from the client) to develop plausible worst cases. It is also useful to examine the plausible best&#13;
case scenario, and to then proceed to a formal decision-analysis that takes into account the risk&#13;
preferences of decision-makers, and the economic consequences of having to make decisions&#13;
under highly uncertain assumptions - as well illustrated by the potential consequences of the&#13;
current decline in oil prices were they to persist for several years (see example in Technical&#13;
Note C4). Several recent hydro project appraisals have used scenario analysis to test the&#13;
robustness of economic returns to worst case conditions and serious accidents (which in case of&#13;
hydro projects is powerhouse flooding attributable to extreme weather events or equipment&#13;
failures: the costs of such events being not just the cost of repair, but also the cost of lost&#13;
generation41).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13.      ADDITIONAL STUDIES&#13;
79.      As recognised in the OPSPQ guidelines, not all the information necessary to assess the&#13;
full set of expected project consequences may be available at the PCN stage. In setting the&#13;
analytical form and scope of the analysis, the OPSPQ guidelines require that the economist: 42&#13;
      Delineate the causal framework that links the project activity to ultimate outcomes of interest. List&#13;
      the major assumptions utilized by the causal chain framework. Define a clear link between project&#13;
      activity, intermediate outcomes/objectives, and ultimate outcomes/outputs (program development&#13;
      objectives) within the result chain framework:&#13;
       (i)        Determine whether this is a project where the results chain is well established and&#13;
                  documented. Determine how to effectively utilize this prior knowledge.&#13;
       (ii)       Determine whether it would be appropriate for supplementary studies to be supported&#13;
                  by, or conducted in conjunction with, project activities in order to improve knowledge&#13;
                  around project impacts and important mitigating factors. These studies may run the&#13;
                  gamut from small-scale observational exercises to a full-blown prospective impact&#13;
                  evaluation, depending on the informational needs and timeframe of the project.&#13;
&#13;
80.      In addition, the OPSPQ guidelines recognise that 43&#13;
      . . . . In many projects in todayâ&#128;&#153;s portfolio it may not be possible to arrive at a comprehensive&#13;
      monetary value of benefits, or else prohibitively costly to do so, once more making it difficult to&#13;
      provide a numerical estimate of the rate the return&#13;
&#13;
81.     In the case of some high cost renewable energy projects, it is often argued that several&#13;
positive project outcomes provide additional justification, but which are excluded from the&#13;
customary quantification of economic flows: the usual economic rate of return therefore&#13;
provides only a partial picture of potential benefits. These benefits relate to&#13;
    ï&#130;· Energy security&#13;
    ï&#130;· Macroeconomic impacts (including beneficial employment impacts)&#13;
    ï&#130;· Learning curve benefits (whose benefits to society can only be realised in the future if&#13;
        projects in the early phase of the learning curve for new technology are financed today)&#13;
&#13;
Energy Security&#13;
82.     Energy security has rarely been clearly defined, which makes it hard to measure and&#13;
therefore difficult to balance against other policy objectives. Indeed, discussion of energy&#13;
security requires much caution and scepticism: as noted by the eminent MIT economist Paul&#13;
Joskow, â&#128;&#156;There is one thing that has not changed since the early 1970s. If you cannot think of a&#13;

&amp;#12;reasoned rationale for some policy based on standard economic reasoning, then argue that the policy is&#13;
necessary to promote â&#128;&#156;energy security.â&#128;?44&#13;
&#13;
83.      A large and growing literature discusses energy security, but very little of this is&#13;
relevant to the specific question of whether energy security benefits can be quantified in a form&#13;
useful to CBA: that is, framed as a line item in the tabulation of economic flows. Policy-makers&#13;
in many countries assert that energy security is of great concern, but often they do little to use&#13;
the already available tools to improve the financial and physical dimensions of energy security&#13;
(fossil fuel price hedging, increasing tank farm storage, etc.)       Nor do many place much&#13;
emphasis on energy efficiency and efficient pricing policy, both of which reduce the&#13;
vulnerability of an energy system to all of the risks and uncertainties associated with energy&#13;
supply.&#13;
&#13;
84.      Thus one of the pitfalls is to claim benefits against imaginary concerns. It is claimed, for&#13;
example, that RE will improve energy security because a country will be less vulnerable to&#13;
supply disruptions and price volatility of imported fossil fuels. But were that indeed a concern,&#13;
then the question would be how the incremental costs of a RE project compares to other&#13;
alternatives to address the same concern as may be proposed by Government even in the&#13;
absence of any renewable energy projects â&#128;&#147; for example, by mandating increased physical&#13;
storage (say an extra 30 days coal supply to be stockpiled at coal projects, or the establishment&#13;
of a strategic petroleum reserve).45&#13;
&#13;
85.     The large literature on the macroeconomic consequences of fossil fuel price shocks&#13;
concludes that the impacts are not symmetrical â&#128;&#147; the loss of GDP following the price shock is&#13;
not regained once the price decreases again. Consequently any policy that reduces exposure to&#13;
price shock by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels would be of economic benefit.&#13;
&#13;
86.     But translating these effects into an oil price volatility risk premium that can be&#13;
included in the ERR calculations is difficult, and rarely attempted. A recent study for Latin&#13;
America by the Inter-American Development Bank suggests this risk premium to be very&#13;
small, (0.01 USc/kWh), an order of magnitude lower than the damage costs from local air&#13;
pollution of thermal generation.46 A study to develop an avoided cost tariff for Indonesian&#13;
geothermal development estimates the volatility premium at 0.07 USc/kWh (estimated as the&#13;
cost to Ministry of Finance of short-term financing of unexpected increased subsidy to PLN in&#13;
wake of forecasting errors of PLNâ&#128;&#153;s fuel costs attributable to unforeseen price volatility).47&#13;
Another study for the EU shows the cost of the â&#128;&#156;oil security externalityâ&#128;? to be less than 0.01&#13;
Eurocent/kWh.48&#13;
&#13;
87.     One approach is to define energy security as an attribute in a broader evaluation of the&#13;
tradeoffs between economic returns and risk using mean-variance portfolio theory, which&#13;
examines the trade-off between expected economic returns (say measured as the levelised cost&#13;
of energy) against risk (standard deviation of returns). 49 Nevertheless, the central question for&#13;

45      An ongoing ESMAP study for Afghanistan proposes a methodology for evaluating energy environmental-&#13;
        energy-security trade-offs in situations of high uncertainty (a situation that Afghanistan shares with a&#13;
        number of post-conflict World Bank client countries). The study will be completed later in 2015.&#13;

49      As proposed by Auerbuch and others who argue that the role of renewables in a portfolio of generating&#13;
        assets is the same as the role of relatively risk fee treasuries in a financial portfolio (see, e.g., S. Auerbuch,&#13;

&amp;#12;any energy security argument for renewable energy â&#128;&#147; in essence an argument for less exposure&#13;
to fossil fuel price volatility risk â&#128;&#147; is whether the incremental cost of renewable is a more cost-&#13;
effective hedge than relevant alternatives, and how much a decision-maker is prepared to pay&#13;
for that lower risk. These questions about the ability to quantify energy security benefits, and&#13;
the extent to which they can be incorporated in the table of economic flows, are discussed&#13;
further in Technical Note C7.&#13;
&#13;
Macroeconomic benefits&#13;
88.      A general discussion of energy-macroeconomic linkages lies outside the scope of this&#13;
paper. We take as given that provision of electricity is fundamental to economic development,&#13;
and that severe and prolonged power shortages impede the rate of economic growth. The&#13;
welfare benefits of electrification are well established (and are confirmed by the IEG study of&#13;
this topic).50 Equally well-established are the macroeconomic penalties associated with&#13;
excessive (and often poorly targeted) subsidies on electricity and the fuels used to generate it.&#13;
With rare exceptions (for very large projects in small countries), 51 few power sector projects&#13;
need to run CGE and input/output models to evaluate macro-economic consequences as part&#13;
of project appraisals. In most cases the presumption is that a project is too small to affect&#13;
labour markets. However, as noted earlier, recently CGE modelling has been used in the PSIA&#13;
of a large power sector reform DPC project where significant price changes are anticipated as a&#13;
result of subsidy and efficiency reforms, with significant potential for negative impacts on poor&#13;
households.&#13;
&#13;
Learning curve benefits&#13;
89.      So called learning curve benefits are often raised as a justification for Bank finance of&#13;
projects that cannot be justified at todayâ&#128;&#153;s technology and GHG damage costs, but which&#13;
deserve support at the early stages of the learning curve â&#128;&#147; for in the absence of early stage&#13;
projects, potential technology cost reductions would never be achieved. The dramatic falls in&#13;
the cost of solar PV are often held up as an example. Potential learning curve benefits are not&#13;
restricted to renewable energy: carbon capture and storage (CCS), and new nuclear technology&#13;
will be subject to similar cost reductions as the technology matures. However, such&#13;
technologies involving large mechanical and thermal components (including CSP, CCS and&#13;
advanced nuclear reactors) cannot be expected to have the same rates of learning as PV.&#13;
&#13;
90.      Learning curve benefits are of two types: those whose benefits can validly be included&#13;
in the project economic flows, and those whose benefits cannot be assigned to the project under&#13;
appraisal, but accrue to other projects in the future.&#13;
&#13;
91.      The first makes assumptions about the reductions in average cost of technology&#13;
achievable during a second phase of a project â&#128;&#147; for example, in the economic analysis of the&#13;
Egypt Wind Project it was assumed that the cost of wind energy will decrease from 8 to 5&#13;
USc/kWh as a consequence of â&#128;&#156;increasing technical efficiencyâ&#128;?. However, no further&#13;
justification was offered, presumably reflecting the view that these cost decreases are self-&#13;
evident. Such unsupported assumptions should be avoided - or at the very least subjected to a&#13;
switching value analysis to display the impact on economic returns.&#13;
92.      The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s literature reveals just two serious attempts at quantifying the learning&#13;
curve benefits of the second type â&#128;&#147; for wind power as part of the project preparation for the&#13;
China Renewable Energy Scale-up Project (CRESP), and for the Morocco Noor II&amp;III CSP&#13;
projects. In both cases a benefit cost analysis was prepared that takes the form of defining as&#13;
costs the subsidies required to build projects at present costs today, to be balanced against the&#13;

51      The Mahaweli Ganga Scheme (irrigation and power) in Sri Lanka would be one of these exceptions â&#128;&#147; a&#13;
        project so large as to have consumed a major share of national capital expenditure and labor inputs&#13;
        (crowding out investment in other sectors), and changed to such large extent agricultural productivity that&#13;
        significant changes in the structure of the economy resulted: see, e.g., World Bank, 2012. Sri Lanka: Mahaweli&#13;

&amp;#12;future benefits that are expressed as the difference between the lower (future) cost of the&#13;
technology against the fossil fuelled alternative. Technical Note T3 summarises these two&#13;
studies, but too little work is currently available to make a best practice recommendation on&#13;
this subject.&#13;
&#13;
93.      Learning curve benefits do not change the economic flows of the project being financed&#13;
at todayâ&#128;&#153;s capital costs. Nor do they answer the question of who bears the incremental costs of&#13;
a high-cost renewable energy project in the short term. It is only relevant as additional&#13;
justification for the World Bank to finance such projects â&#128;&#147; and therefore informs the second of&#13;
the three main questions for economic analysis required by the new OPSPQ guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
94.     Another way of thinking about learning curve benefits is as a real option. Investment&#13;
in a CSP today will (likely) have a negative NPV. But in 20 years time, in the absence of such&#13;
CSP projects today the option to use CSP to stave off catastrophic climate change would not be&#13;
available (or only at prohibitive cost in the absence of prior learning). So an investment in CSP&#13;
today is desirable because it will create the option of rapid (and low cost) decarbonisation in&#13;
the future, not because of its own return in the short run.52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.     MULTI-ATTRIBUTE TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS (MATA)&#13;
95.     Cost-benefit analysis is the standard tool for evaluating projects in Bank Practice. The&#13;
presumption is that provided all of the relevant externalities can be included in the economic&#13;
flows, the correct investment decision follows from choosing that alternative with the highest&#13;
NPV. But as recognised by OPSPQ, this is not always possible.&#13;
&#13;
96.      Multi-attribute decision analysis is one approach to go beyond the single objective cost-&#13;
benefit analysis as a basis for making decisions. This offers some practical help in coming to&#13;
better decisions in face of multiple objectives where not all variables of interest can be&#13;
monetised; by providing better insights into the problems by forcing clarity about goals and&#13;
risks; by facilitating understanding (if not agreement) among diverse stakeholders; and by&#13;
assisting decision-makers in making trade-offs.&#13;
&#13;
97.     In the assessment of renewable energy technologies, GHG emissions are often treated&#13;
as a separate attribute precisely because their valuation is controversial, and invite distracting&#13;
debate about discount rates. Undiscounted lifetime GHG emissions is thus an often-&#13;
encountered attribute (and is also used by the CTF calculation of marginal abatement cost).&#13;
MATA is discussed in detail in Technical Note M6.&#13;

         cost escalation and delays).          Note that&#13;
         traditional least-cost planning models chose capacity based on firm capacity available&#13;
         at the time of the system peak, to which wind and solar generally contribute very&#13;
         little.53&#13;
     ï&#130;· Because a project is the least cost way of achieving carbon emission reductions . The&#13;
         Indonesia geothermal project is an excellent example: the capacity expansion plan&#13;
         shows coal to be the least-cost option for meeting base load requirements. But the&#13;
         Government is committed to power sector carbon emission reductions, and among the&#13;
         available renewable energy options, geothermal is the least-cost way of achieving such&#13;
         reductions. The principal challenge in this kind of project is a demonstration that&#13;
         economic returns are assured when the relevant externalities and uncertainties are&#13;
         properly valued. In the case of variable renewables (such as wind and run-of-river&#13;
         hydro) there is the additional problem of properly recognising the costs of&#13;
         intermittency, seasonal, and inter-annual variation.&#13;
     ï&#130;· Because a project is the least cost way of reducing local air pollution : This has been&#13;
         one of the main drivers of renewable energy projects in China, and to a lesser extent in&#13;
         India as well. However, the â&#128;&#156;least costâ&#128;? rationale needs careful justification, and a RE&#13;
         project needs to be compared to other interventions as well (for example, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
53      However, as noted in Technical Note T1, portfolios of renewable energy projects of different types and in&#13;
        different locations may provide system wide capacity benefits that may well not apply to a single project.&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                                                      26&#13;
&amp;#12;         Shandong project showed that to improve urban air quality, retrofitting FGD was more&#13;
         cost-effective than new renewable energy projects. 54&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Because a project contributes to the renewable energy learning curve that will make&#13;
         the technology in question the least-cost way of achieving carbon emission reductions&#13;
         in the future. These are projects where even if all relevant externalities (and&#13;
         particularly carbon emission reductions) are monetised and included in the economic&#13;
         flows, economic returns are still below the hurdle rate at present technology costs, and&#13;
         at present valuations of greenhouse gas (GHG) damage costs. Concentrated solar&#13;
         power (CSP) and PV are the main examples here. The challenge for economic analysis&#13;
         is to show that such projects contribute to the global learning curve necessary to bring&#13;
         about cost reductions in the long run; and to demonstrate a credible case for additional&#13;
         macroeconomic benefits that derive from local manufacture of project components.&#13;

assessments of the support policy framework as part&#13;
of the project preparation work. Even though the recommendations of economic reasoning&#13;
regarding support mechanisms have not always been accepted by Governments, bringing these&#13;
matters to active discussion have demonstrated the importance of the questions raised, which&#13;
in turn led to successful renewable energy projects. Nowhere is this more important than in&#13;
the transparent recovery of incremental costs that will determine the sustainability of tariff&#13;
support instruments. There are several issues that deserve attention in such a policy review:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Targets: RE projects are often proposed on grounds that they are required to meet&#13;
         Government targets. The main question is whether such targets have been derived on&#13;
         the basis of standard economic reasoning (intersection of the RE supply curve with the&#13;
         full social cost of thermal generation, including their environmental damage costs), or&#13;
         are they merely an aspirational goal (see Technical Note M3, Supply Curves). The&#13;
         credibility and longevity of targets has come under increasing question in many&#13;
         countries, yet credible commitments to introduce a new technology are vital to&#13;
         attracting local investment into manufacture of components.&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Energy sector context: power sector options need examination in a broader context of&#13;
         energy policy and low-carbon development. A good example is biomass utilisation for&#13;
         power generation, which may in fact increase national GHG emissions. For example in&#13;
         Vietnam, rice husk is extensively used in rural industry (brick making, ceramics) where&#13;
         it displaces oil and coal. But if used for power generation then it will displace the most&#13;
         expensive thermal generation, which (in Vietnam) is gas CCGT (whose gas price is&#13;
         linked to Singapore fuel oil prices). A feed-in tariff high enough to enable biomass&#13;
         power generation will drive up rice husk prices (as occurred in Thailand), pushing&#13;

&amp;#12;         rural industry back to oil and coal, whose GHG emissions are higher than those from&#13;
         the gas power projects displaced by biomass electricity generation.&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Policy instruments: a wide range of policy instruments are in use, but often their&#13;
         design is not economically rational. In mandatory green purchase requirements&#13;
         imposed on distribution companies, penalties for non-compliance are often completely&#13;
         arbitrary (made worse by arbitrary targets and quota sizes).&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Incremental costs: Where targets are aspirational, they are often set without any effort&#13;
         to estimate the incremental costs. In the CRESP project, the Government acted in full&#13;
         knowledge of the incremental costs of large scale wind power development when&#13;
         setting the tariff support mechanism; by contrast, the 2012 Indonesian feed-in tariff and&#13;
         the various targets set by the Government for geothermal projects, were issued without&#13;
         any analysis of the incremental cost and the impact on MoF that was to provide the&#13;
         necessary subsidy (see Technical Note C6, distributional analysis). The extent to which&#13;
         buyers - whether provincial distribution companies, or large vertically integrated&#13;
         utilities - can treat RE power purchases as pass-throughs is a frequent question (and&#13;
         often determines the extent of opposition of such buyers to renewable energy).&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Willingness to pay for mitigation of global and local externalities. The question of&#13;
         whether a relatively poor country should value carbon at levels far in excess of the&#13;
         value in the worldâ&#128;&#153;s carbon markets arises frequently ($30/ton CO2 according to the&#13;
         World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s current Guideline, as against the present $10/ton CO2 price the EU&#13;
         carbon trading scheme).&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Rationality of support tariffs: Economic reasoning holds that tariffs should reflect the&#13;
         economic costs of supply. When setting an avoided cost tariff its build-up (of the&#13;
         various benefits) should reflect the same line items as used in the table of economic&#13;
         flows used in CBA. In competitive systems, benefit-based tariff ceilings (whether&#13;
         published or not) serve to ensure that winning bids do not exceed benefits.55 Such&#13;
         economic reasoning conflicts with the widespread use of feed-in tariffs based on the&#13;
         estimated production costs of the IPP which are preferred by developers (but whose&#13;
         principal interest is adequate revenue, not economic efficiency).&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Competition: Competitive tendering of IPPs is generally the preferred approach, but&#13;
         this again conflicts with fixed feed-in tariffs â&#128;&#147; which forces developer selection into one&#13;
         of several inferior options (first come-first served or beauty contests, neither of which&#13;
         ensure economic efficiency in project selection). On the other hand, transaction costs&#13;
         dictate that small projects be exempted from competition â&#128;&#147; so the question becomes&#13;
         one of setting an appropriate threshold.&#13;
     ï&#130;·   PPA: Many Bank renewable energy projects involve on-lending through local banks in&#13;
         support of portfolios of qualified renewable energy subprojects. The worldwide&#13;
         experience is that a standardised PPA is always preferable to ad hoc project by project&#13;
         negotiation. And even where IPPs are selected by competitive tender (e.g., Indonesia&#13;
         geothermal), the tariff schedules of the PPA should be fixed at time of tender (to avoid&#13;
         interminable post-award negotiations on escalation and indexation).&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Institutional Issues: A range of issues need assessment, including the human resource&#13;
         issues associated with staffing and leadership of RE units in Ministries; how to define&#13;
         the role of the state (for example in countries with geothermal resources, defining the&#13;
         role of the State in up-front exploration); the extent to which resource data should be in&#13;
         the public domain; and the need for enabling legislation, among others. While these&#13;
         are not directly matters of economic analysis in project appraisal, they will determine&#13;
         the extent to which economic reasoning can be brought to bear on decision-making.&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Procedures for support tariff implementation: A rational tariff-setting process â&#128;&#147;&#13;
         involving regular review, stakeholder consultation, and a published methodology â&#128;&#147; is&#13;
         vital for a successful RE program, particularly from the perspective of lender-&#13;
         confidence in cash-flow forecasts. Even where independent electricity regulators (or&#13;
         Public Utility Commissions) are not part of the institutional framework, entities housed&#13;
         within Ministries of Energy can provide leadership for tariff reform, and promote a&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
variable wind and solar generation into grid&#13;
operations is challenging: since wind and solar generation only occur when wind and solar&#13;
resources are available, their output is not controllable. Grid operators are accustomed to&#13;
dealing with variability, but primarily on the load side. The challenge is that higher levels of&#13;
wind and solar generation add both variability and uncertainty.&#13;
103.     Several countriesâ&#128;&#148;notably Denmark, Germany, Portugal, and Spainâ&#128;&#148;are providing&#13;
real-world experience in integrating high levels of variable generation, primarily wind power.&#13;
In addition, several integration studies have modeled and simulated the addition of large&#13;
amounts of wind, and to a lesser extent, solar generation to the grid. Such studies provide&#13;
valuable information on the expected impacts of high levels of variable energy generation and&#13;
potential strategies for successfully integrating variable energy generation into the system.&#13;
These studies look at the technical operational impacts of integrating these resources into the&#13;
systems and the potential technical and economic implications to system operations, notably&#13;
short-term, reserve-related costs. Globally, variable renewable generation sources still&#13;
represent mainly an energy rather than a capacity resource. While their contributions to&#13;
capacity or â&#128;&#156;firmâ&#128;? power and associated costs are different from those of conventional power&#13;
sources, variable renewable generation technologies can contribute to long-term system&#13;
adequacy and security. Several lessons learned can be gleaned from both operating experiences&#13;
and integration studies. The best summary of this experience is Madrigal &amp; Porter. 56&#13;
104.     Where a good capacity expansion planning model is available, the capacity credit can&#13;
be assessed by examining the capacity expansion plan with and without the project â&#128;&#147; the model&#13;
will determine how much other capacity is actually displaced â&#128;&#147; some units will be delayed,&#13;
some eliminated completely â&#128;&#147; though even here the user has to input the firm capacity of a RE&#13;
project at the time of peak demand (which for many RE technologies may be quite small). But&#13;
where such a model is not available, the best approach is to treat energy benefits and capacity&#13;
benefits separately, rather than just compare on the basis of levelised cost of energy (against the&#13;
counterfactual) - and then calculate the switching value for the extent of capacity credit&#13;
required to reach the hurdle rate (see example in Technical Note T4).&#13;
105.    Wind projects in particular impose a range of system integration costs that arise as a&#13;
consequence of the highly variable output. These costs will be a function of the scale of wind&#13;
penetration: the greater the fraction of penetration, the greater the potential difficulty in&#13;

&amp;#12;accommodating the variability. A 100 MW wind project connected to the 30,000 MW Java-Bali&#13;
grid in Indonesia can be accommodated with little difficulty; but a 10 MW wind project on a&#13;
small eastern island heretofore served by a 20 MW of diesel may impose a range of additional&#13;
system costs that need to be reflected in a CBA. An excellent starting point for understanding&#13;
the integration of wind in small diesel systems is Garrad Hassan. 57&#13;
106.    The impact of wind power depends not just on the wind power penetration level, 58 but&#13;
also on the power system size, the seasonal and daily variation patterns, transmission network&#13;
topology, generation capacity mix (particularly the proportion of storage and pumped storage&#13;
hydro), the degree of interconnection to neighbouring systems, and load variations. In short,&#13;
the problem is complex, and therefore plausible quantification of network integration costs&#13;
generally goes beyond the competence of the (average) project economist. For non-engineers,&#13;
Romero59 is an excellent introduction.&#13;
107.     The costs imposed on the buyer of intermittent energy include the following 60:&#13;
ï&#130;· Cost of additional firm capacity needed to counter the seasonal and inter-annual&#13;
     variability.&#13;
ï&#130;· Increased O&amp;M costs at existing thermal units called upon to ramp output levels over a&#13;
     broader range and more often and with shorter notice.&#13;
ï&#130;· The heat rate penalties (and related fuel costs) associated with such increased ramping&#13;
ï&#130;· Regulation costs (that arise from the intra-hour variability of wind resources that requires&#13;
     additional fast response capacity be available).&#13;
ï&#130;· Systems operations cost (that arise from less than optimal operation of the system as a&#13;
     consequence of the uncertain nature of wind energy production).&#13;
ï&#130;· Gas storage costs (that arise from inaccuracies in the amount of gas nominated each day,&#13;
     which may require the need to inject or withdraw gas from storage at short notice).&#13;
ï&#130;· Large-scale grid-connected battery storage which still remains very expensive and is not&#13;
     currently available at a commercial scale (though these costs are expected to decline in the&#13;
     future, possibly quite rapidly).&#13;
Technical Note T1 discusses and summarises the order of magnitude of incremental system&#13;
integration costs as reported in the literature.&#13;
108.     Power utilities will often raise a long list of technical problems associated with network&#13;
stability that are difficult for an economist to assess, and the technical engineering experts&#13;
brought in by the TTL will often be reluctant to give precise estimates in light of uncertainties,&#13;
especially where detailed system studies have yet to be performed: this is frequently the case at&#13;
the time when support tariffs are being discussed by Government, and the utility has no prior&#13;
experience with wind projects. Often the main question (and the fo cus of the buying utilityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
main objection to wind power) is how the incremental transmission connection costs are to be&#13;
financed (see Technical Note T2). The project economistâ&#128;&#153;s role is to insist that plausible&#13;
integration costs are developed: even so, very often the only recourse is to include a generic&#13;
estimate of costs from the informed literature, and treat this as one of the variables in the&#13;
sensitivity analysis and risk assessment of economic returns.&#13;

&#13;
(grid-connected) thermal generation that is the next best alternative to the project.&#13;
&#13;
110.     In the case of substitution benefits, the impact on electricity consumers derives from&#13;
any change in tariff: other things equal, a renewable energy project with high incremental costs&#13;
will result in an increase in tariff (and a loss of consumer surplus); a renewable energy project in&#13;
the least cost plan (for example a hydro project that would displace a gas CCGT) will result in a&#13;
decrease in tariff (and an increase in consumer surplus). Because many of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s clients&#13;
have electricity tariffs that are far from cost-reflective, the incremental costs of renewable&#13;
energy are often absorbed by Governments through additional subsidy to utilities.&#13;
&#13;
111.      A geothermal project on a remote Indonesian island grid previously served (poorly)&#13;
only by diesels for just a few hours a day may bring 24-hour power, and significant additional&#13;
electricity consumption. The same is true of some hydropower projects whose main rationale&#13;
is alleviation of power shortages in peak hours (as in the case of the Tarbela T4 extension&#13;
project). In such cases the incremental benefits are assessed on the basis of willingness-to-pay&#13;
(WTP) derived from demand curves based on household surveys. Technical Note M2&#13;
discusses further the implications of the choices for valuation, and the problems of using&#13;
survey-based willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates.&#13;
&#13;
The impact of renewable energy tariff design&#13;
112.     Good tariff design can influence the technical design of renewable energy projects.&#13;
Most flat rate feed-in tariffs (FITs) (based on estimates of production costs) provide little&#13;
incentive to design projects that maximise peak hour generation and provide capacity benefit&#13;
to the grid. For example in the case of small hydro, a tariff specified simply as USc/kWh gives&#13;
no incentive for developers to propose high-head, daily peaking projects that require relatively&#13;
little pondage to achieve this. However, the experience of Vietnam demonstrates that&#13;
developers will respond to time-of-day and time-of-season generation tariffs to propose daily&#13;
peaking projects that have much greater benefits than pure run-of-river projects. (The&#13;
Vietnamese avoided cost tariff for small renewable energy producers offers a substantial&#13;
premium for energy produced during the peak hours of the dry season). 61&#13;
&#13;
Portfolio diversification&#13;
113.    It may well be true that a single small hydro project, or a single wind turbine, has no&#13;
(or very little) capacity value. But a portfolio of small hydro projects spread across several&#13;
catchments may provide a significant capacity benefit through spatial diversification. And&#13;
there are many countries where a portfolio consisting of wind and small hydro can diversify&#13;
the seasonal output (for example, as shown in the CRESP studies for Zhejiang, where a&#13;

&#13;
115.    A useful demonstration of the plausibility of a renewable energy project is to examine&#13;
the proposed projectâ&#128;&#153;s position in the renewable energy supply curve. The construction of such&#13;
supply curves, and how to avoid some of the pitfalls, are discussed in Technical Note M3.&#13;
&#13;
116.    Although one can generally recommend the use of capacity expansion planning&#13;
models such as WASP and EGEAS to assist in the development of the counter-factual, the&#13;
contribution of firm energy from intermittent renewables has to be determined exogenously by&#13;
the user â&#128;&#147; so caution is required: the economist would be wise to consult with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s power&#13;
systems planning experts to assess the credibility of claims about the firm capacity contribution&#13;

&amp;#12;118.    The rationality of renewable energy tariffs is thus of major importance to an economic&#13;
analysis. Of necessity, many PADs discuss the arrangements for RE tariffs, but caution is&#13;
needed in how that discussion is framed. From the perspective of economic efficiency, the&#13;
optimum level of renewable energy is given by the intersection of the renewable energy supply&#13;
curve with the social cost of thermal generation (i.e. including consideration of all local&#13;
externalities), and with due consideration of adjusting supply curves for capacity penalties.&#13;
The ideal tariff is therefore set at this level, and ideally the marketplace best decides what mix&#13;
of technologies can achieve carbon emission reduction at least cost. Unfortunately this ideal is&#13;
not always appreciated by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s client countries.&#13;
119.    Yet technology-specific and above all generous feed-in tariffs based on estimated&#13;
production costs are popular around the world precisely because they have been demonstrated&#13;
to achieve ambitious MW targets for wind and solar installed capacity. But for developing&#13;
countries where the new Bank economic analysis guidelines now make clear that the prime&#13;
focus should be the development benefits of a project, any feed-in tariff that lies above the&#13;
avoided social cost of thermal generation needs careful justification, and a PAD should provide&#13;
clear demonstration of why incremental costs above the optimal tariff are justified, and how&#13;
they should be recovered.&#13;
120.    This is no different to the general aspects of electricity tariff design, where deviations&#13;
from the optimal electricity tariff require careful justification. Lifeline tariffs reflect a valid&#13;
Government objective, and some degree of deviation from the economic optimum for sake of&#13;
equity is a trade-off for Government to make. But the targeting performance (i.e. what&#13;
proportion of the subsidy provided is captured by the intended beneficiary) always needs&#13;
assessment.&#13;

beneficial impact. But at such scale, the incremental&#13;
capital requirements (even if to some extent covered by concessional green financing) may well&#13;
crowd out other investments and other job-creating expenditures.64&#13;
&#13;
122.      Such macroeconomic benefits as derive from domestic manufacture of RE equipment&#13;
have been proposed for several CSP and wind projects. But we know of only one study that is&#13;
of sufficient credibility to allow inclusion of macroeconomic benefits in the economic accounts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
63      See e.g., A. Bowen, Green Growth, Green Jobs and Labor Markets, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper&#13;
        5990, March 2012.&#13;
64      The South Africa Medupi coal project illustrates the problem. The economic analysis showed that even&#13;
        leaving aside any additional capacity costs to offset the lack of firm capacity of wind projects, to produce the&#13;
        same energy at the Medupi coal project would require an additional $20billion of investment capital, far in&#13;
        excess of the carbon finance (of around $1billion) actually available to South Africa (see Table M5.8,&#13;
        Technical Note M5).&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                                                          33&#13;
&amp;#12;of a major renewable energy project â&#128;&#147; that for Morocco, prepared under the auspices of the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s MENA CSP initiative.65&#13;
&#13;
123.     The main issue is that these macroeconomic benefits are almost always contingent on&#13;
the assurance of a sufficiently large domestic market to justify the necessary private investment&#13;
in domestic manufacturing facilities which will generate the macroeconomic benefits. That in&#13;
turn translates into the credibility of Government commitments to supporting a particular RE&#13;
technology. Few industrialists will be persuaded on the basis of aspirational renewable energy&#13;
targets (by 2020, so many percent of power generation from renewable energy): what is needed&#13;
are plausible and enforceable institutional and pricing reforms. In Morocco the Government&#13;
has backed up its targets with the establishment of a strong agency (MASEN) to implement&#13;
solar projects, and to provide credible financial backing: but elsewhere supporting policies are&#13;
often weak. The practical question for the project economist would be whether project&#13;
preparation funds are sufficient to include a high quality study of potential macroeconomic&#13;
benefits for the country in question.      Technical Note T5 further discusses macroeconomic&#13;
spillovers of renewable energy.&#13;

                         RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS: CHECKLIST&#13;
 Note: These questions are in addition to those that apply to all power sector projects&#13;
(enumerated in the general Checklist of Table 2.1)&#13;
&#13;
      Step                   Issue&#13;
1     Rationale              ï&#130;·   If not least-cost, then is the selected renewable energy project the least-&#13;
                                 cost option for GHG emission reduction compared to other RE options, or&#13;
                                 to EE and T&amp;D loss reduction?&#13;
2.    Policy review          ï&#130;·   Have all the relevant issues been assessed? (targets, incremental costs,&#13;
                                 rationality of tariffs, competition, PPAs, institutional capacity).&#13;
3.    Methodology            ï&#130;·   Does the presentation in the appraisal summary section of the PAD&#13;
                                 conform to the format of Table 3.1?&#13;
4.    Data                   ï&#130;·   Have the resource data series (wind speed data, hydrology) been&#13;
                                 examined for long term trends? (M7)&#13;
5.    Project Costs          ï&#130;·   Are the consequences of intermittency presented? (T1)&#13;
                             ï&#130;·   Have the system integration costs imposed on the buyer been quantified?&#13;
                                 (T1)&#13;
                             ï&#130;·   Are the incremental transmission costs described and included in the&#13;
                                 table of economic flows? (T2)&#13;
                             ï&#130;·   For hydro projects, are the calculations of GHG emissions from reservoirs&#13;
                                 consistent with the Water Practice Guidelines?&#13;
6.    Project benefits       ï&#130;·   Have all the externalities associated with displaced thermal generation&#13;
                                 been assessed? (see Checklist, Table C3.1)&#13;
7.    Define the             ï&#130;·   If a system planning model is used to establish the impact of the RE&#13;
      alternatives to            project on the system dispatch and capacity expansion plan, are the input&#13;
      the project                assumptions based on economic prices? (C1)&#13;
                             ï&#130;·   Where does the project lie on the supply curve for renewable energy?&#13;
                                 (M3)&#13;
8.    Baseline               ï&#130;·   Is the rationale for a capacity credit credible? (T1)&#13;
      calculations,          ï&#130;·   In the case of VRE, are the capacity benefits clearly identified in the&#13;
      economic                   economic flows? (T1)&#13;
      returns&#13;
9     Financial              ï&#130;·    Are the renewable energy support tariffs adequate to assure financial&#13;
      analysis                    sustainability?&#13;
                             ï&#130;·    What are the arrangements for the recovery of incremental costs, and are&#13;
                                  these credible and sustainable? (C6)&#13;

&amp;#12;      Step             Issue&#13;
10.   Distributional   ï&#130;·   Are the incremental costs of high-cost VRE identified, and does the&#13;
      analysis             analysis show who bears them (providers of concessionary finance,&#13;
                           electricity consumers, or Government) (C6)&#13;
11.   Sensitivity      ï&#130;·   In the case of intermittent renewables, does the sensitivity analysis show&#13;
      analysis             the relationship between capacity credit and economic return? (T1)&#13;
12.   Risk             ï&#130;·   Have the risks uniquely associated with natural resource variability&#13;
      Assessment           (hydrology risk, wind speed variability, solar insolation variations) been&#13;
                           adequately presented and characterised as probability distributions (M7)&#13;
&#13;
13.   Scenario and     ï&#130;·   Are trade-offs between costs and environmental indicators to show win-&#13;
      trade-off            win options and trade-offs considered (M6)&#13;
      analysis&#13;
14.   Need for         ï&#130;·   If energy security benefits are claimed, are plausible arguments presented&#13;
      additional           that even in the absence of the renewable energy project, the Government&#13;
      studies              is taking actions to enhance energy security by reducing the potential&#13;
                           impact of physical interruption (increased fuel stocks, petroleum reserves)&#13;
                           or by reducing the impact of fuel price volatility (reduce subsidies on&#13;
                           fossil fuels, cost reflective tariffs)? (C7)&#13;
                       ï&#130;·   Are the claims for learning curve benefits presented in proper context&#13;
                           (i.e., that they do not benefit the project under appraisal, but are mainly&#13;
                           relevant to the rationale for Bank involvement in financing)? (T3)&#13;
