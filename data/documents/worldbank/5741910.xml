            The future of aid 2 : the big push
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This note considers the future of aid
            from the perspective of the 2005-2030 time frame. It offers
            a possible scenario for the future, with responses of the
            aid industry to falling numbers of people in absolute
            poverty and to the growing ability of poor countries to
            borrow from the market. A companion note (report 32124)
            offers a second scenario. The notes were written in the
            spirit of plausible stories about the future to encourage
            thinking about possible responses.
