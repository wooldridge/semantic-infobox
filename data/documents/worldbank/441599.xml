Financing Water and Sanitation Projects-&#13;
The Unique Risks&#13;
David            A project finance structure allows water projects with attractive cash flows and risk profiles to&#13;

Ashoka Mody      secure long-term private capital. This structure provides a direct link between a project's cash&#13;
flow and its funding to give project sponsors, investors, and lenders strong incentives to ensure&#13;
that projects are structured and operated to generate stable revenue streams. But even in&#13;
industrial countries the credit strength of off-taking municipal governments and the sector's&#13;
traditional monopoly structure expose lenders to potentially significant credit, regulatory, and&#13;
political risks. These risks, combined with the sunk, highly specific, and non-redeployable nature&#13;
of water investments, mean that lenders and investors are vulnerable to government&#13;
opportunism and expropriation. Reviewing some recent innovative projects, this Note shows&#13;
that private participation on a limited recourse or nonrecourse basis has required support from&#13;
multilaterals and federal government agencies to absorb noncommercial risks.&#13;

            Financing water and sanitation projects :
            the unique risks
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A project finance structure allows water
            projects with attractive cash flows and risk profiles to
            secure long-term private capital. But even in industrial
            countries the credit strength of off-taking municipal
            governments and the sector's traditional monopoly
            structure expose lenders to potentially significant credit,
            regulatory, and political risks. These risks, combined with
            the sunk, highly specific, and non-redeployable nature of
            water infrastructure investments, mean that lenders and
            investors are vulnerable to opportunistic contracting
            problems and expropriation. Reviewing some recent innovative
            water and sanitation projects, the authors show that private
            capital participation on a limited recourse or nonrecourse
            basis has required support by third parties such as
            multilaterals and federal government agencies to absorb
            noncommercial risks.
