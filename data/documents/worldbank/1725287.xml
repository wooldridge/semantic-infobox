TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Schedule L.A&#13;
Economic Impact and Recovery Program&#13;
Impact on the tourism sector. Dominica's tourism sector is small in comparison with those of&#13;
its OECS neighbors, with gross tourism earnings amounting to less than 20 percent of GDP, mainly on&#13;
account of its dearth of traditional beaches. The country has only recently begun to market its extensive&#13;
rainforests, waterfalls, volcanic sites, and coral reefs, along with its vibrant indigenous culture, to the&#13;
growing eco-tourism market. As such, its tourism data remains deficient, with a lag of some four to five&#13;
months before firm stay-over and excursionist arrival numbers become available. Consequently, this&#13;
analysis is based on estimates for September to December 2001 (the reliability of which is questionable)&#13;
that were prepared by the authorities on the basis of actual air and seaport traffic and past trends in visitor&#13;
breakdowns, rather than actual immigration records.&#13;
Between January and August 2001, visitor traffic to the country had shown a marginal decline&#13;
over the same period in 2000. Cruise arrivals, however, had fallen sharply from July when one of the&#13;
more frequent vessels discontinued calls to Roseau altogether.  Somewhat surprisingly, available&#13;
estimates suggest that in the period following September 11, stay-over visitor arrivals were marginally&#13;
higher than in the same months in 2000. However, given initiatives that were being undertaken by the&#13;
authorities and the attendance at the World Creole Music Festival in October', there are indications that,&#13;
had the events of September 11 not occurred, stayover arrivals would shown much more recovery during&#13;
the last four months of 2001 than was experienced. As a result, it is estimated that the country may have&#13;
forgone roughly EC$10.6 million (US$3.9 million) in calendar year 2001 as a direct result of&#13;
September 11.&#13;

Projections for 2002 are that stay-over arrivals would gradually return to counterfactual levels&#13;
over the year, such that by the last quarter arrivals would have returned to these levels. Cruise visitor&#13;
arrivals are projected in a similar manner, with the exception that there is a persistent weakness in cruise&#13;
arrivals due to a recent announcement that another major line will no longer stop in Dominica, starting&#13;
February 2002. It is important to note that while this implies strong growth rates in 2002, driven by the&#13;
projected recovery, the tourist numbers will still be well below 2000 levels. Tourism earnings for 2002&#13;
are projected to be about EC$8.6 million (US$3.2 million) lower than they would have been in a&#13;
counterfactual scenario allowing for modest growth in arrivals during the year.&#13;
'This festival has attracted continued strong growth in visitors since its establishment in 1996.&#13;

Overall impact. While the impact of the September 11 events on arrivals and earnings is&#13;
moderate, it has had non-negligible fallout on the tourism sector and the broader economy. Real GDP in&#13;
2001 is estimated to have contracted by as much as 4.5 to 5 percentage points, as sluggish tourism activity&#13;
failed to offset sharp declines in the agriculture (especially bananas, on account of continuing difficulties&#13;
in restructuring the sector, compounded by drought), manufacturing, construction, and transportation&#13;
sectors. Under the counterfactual scenario for tourist arrivals, it is estimated that the decline in GDP in&#13;
2001 would have been less severe by roughly one percentage point. The economy is expected to remain&#13;
sluggish in 2002, with real GDP growth projected at about 0.5 percent, resulting in a level of real income&#13;
roughly I percentage point lower than would have prevailed in a counterfactual scenario. In the external&#13;
accounts, the fallout from September 11 is estimated to have worsened the current account deficit by&#13;
about EC$7.9 million (US$2.9 million) in 2001, and a projected EC$6.5 million (US$2.4 million) in&#13;
2002.&#13;
The fiscal impact of September 11 is modest, but puts further strain on a situation that is already&#13;
close to breaking point. The combination of revenue losses and additional expenditure needs as a result&#13;
of the September 11 fallout amounts to an estimated EC$2 million (US$0.7 million) in 2001 and a&#13;
projected EC$5 million (US$1.8 million) in 2002. This is contributing to a further deterioration in&#13;
government saving, already at a negative 2 percent of GDP in 2000, to an estimated negative 5.5 percent&#13;
of GDP in 2001 and - in the absence of corrective measures - a projection of about the same level for&#13;
2002. In parallel, the overall central government deficit deteriorated from 5.8 percent of GDP in 2000 to&#13;
an estimated 8.2 percent in 2001, and - again in the absence of corrective measures - is projected to&#13;
deteriorate further to about 16 percent of GDP in 2002. The authorities are well aware that the present&#13;
fiscal stance is unsustainable (indeed liable to bring about a crisis in the near future) unless immediate&#13;
steps are taken, and are working with the CDB and the ECCB to formulate and implement urgent cost-&#13;
cutting and revenue-enhancing measures (discussed further below).&#13;
Maintaining critical social programs.  In Dominica, there are significant informal linkages&#13;
with the tourism sector which are not captured in national accounts but which impact on social welfare.&#13;
Many households rely on remittances from other islands in the sub-region, namely, Antigua, the US&#13;
Virgin Islands, and Guadeloupe, where there are significant number of Dominican migrants working in&#13;
the tourism sector. In addition, the rural communities who supply informal traders with agricultural&#13;
products destined for smaller neighboring islands - St. Maarten/Martin, St. Croix, St. Thomas and even&#13;
Antigua - report that these traders have been buying lower quantities over the past few months.&#13;
Moreover, the Government has been promoting the development of "community tourism" as an&#13;
alternative rural activity to the declining banana production. As a result, many households near natural or&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
cultural attractions2 that had invested in craft production, selling refreshments and souvenirs, and even&#13;
modest visitor accommodations, are also reporting a contraction in their income from those investments.&#13;
Although the fiscal situation precludes any increase in expenditures on social protection during the&#13;
recovery period, the Government is committed to maintaining its program of targeted assistance to the&#13;
poorest communities through several donor-funded projects that emphasize community infrastructure and&#13;
income generation activities.&#13;
Tourism sector relief and promotional efforts. In light of the situation regarding government&#13;
finances, the authorities in Dominica have been very cautious about extending any further fiscal&#13;
incentives As such, the only relief granted so far has been a one-year waiver of aircraft landing fees. The&#13;
Government is considering a proposal to allow hotel operators to retain a share of the hotel occupancy tax&#13;
to finance additional promotion activities, which would cost around EC$0.75 million (US$280,000), but&#13;
no action has yet been taken on this request. For similar reasons, Dominica has not allocated additional&#13;
resources for tourism promotion, with the exception of the Regional Tourism Emergency Programme for&#13;
which the Government's share of the cost (US$197,500) is being financed by a concessional loan from&#13;
CDB.&#13;
The Government's ongoing work in the tourist sector includes two product development&#13;
initiatives, launched in 2000 by the National Development Corporation, which is responsible for the&#13;
tourism sector. The first - Nature Island Standards of Excellence, supported by CIDA's Caribbean&#13;
Program for Economic Competitiveness - aims to develop, implement and enforce service standards for a&#13;
broad range of operators in the tourism sector, including hotel and restaurant staff, customs and&#13;
immigration officers, taxi and bus drivers, tour guides and water sports operators. In mid-2001, the&#13;
Government enacted a new Tourism Standards Act, and has subsequently developed new standards in&#13;
consultation with the private sector. The authorities are in the process of setting up a new department to&#13;
monitor, evaluate and enforce these standards through the various licensing processes. Stronger laws&#13;
against the harassment of tourists, including increased fines, have also been recently enacted. The second&#13;
initiative - Welcome Dominica! - involves an extensive training program for service providers as a&#13;
complement to the improvement of standards.&#13;
A third program addressing Eco-tourism Certification involves the development of a joint&#13;
destination eco-tourism brand with the National Parks of Martinique and Guadeloupe, and focuses on&#13;
smaller properties. However, this program has been in the works for some time, and has been delayed&#13;
several times because of coordination difficulties. Consequently, this effort is not yet expected to assist in&#13;
the recovery from September I I-related fallout.&#13;
Addressing the fiscal situation. As described above, the fiscal situation in Dominica has been&#13;
deteriorating in recent years. To address the situation, the Government in conjunction with the ECCB&#13;
and CDB, is preparing a fiscal stabilization program, aimed at eliminating the central government current&#13;
account deficit (around 5.5 percent in 2001) over three years. Key pillars of the program under&#13;
preparation include a reduction in public sector employment and wage bill, as well as of the use of goods&#13;
and services; possible restructuring and more active management of government debt; and the curtailment&#13;
of ad hoc tax concessions. The cabinet is considering a proposal establish a joint public-private task&#13;
force, including trade unions and NGOs, to make recommendations on how to implement the needed&#13;
reductions in public expenditures. DFID has assisted with an analysis of the debt situation, including&#13;
consultations with civil society, and are providing technical assistance on a planned overhaul of&#13;
expenditure systems. The Government has approached the CDB for assistance with a comprehensive&#13;
review of existing tax systems, including the feasibility of a VAT or transactions-based tax. In the&#13;
interim, the Government has undertaken some revenue measures, including the conversion of the one-&#13;
time company registration fee to an annual charge, and will focus on accelerating disbursement of its&#13;
underutilized 1995 European Union STABEX resources.&#13;
2 Dominica also has a population of approximately 3000 Caribs (indigenous peoples), whose villages are among the more popular&#13;
tourist sites.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strengthening oversight of the offshore sector.  Dominica has been making steady&#13;
improvements in the management of its offshore sector since mid-2000 when it was listed by the&#13;
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as a weak jurisdiction. Shortly after, the Government established an&#13;
ad hoc committee, including private sector representatives, to make recommendations on how to address&#13;
the shortcomings identified by the FATF. In December 2000, the critical Money Laundering Prevention&#13;
Act was passed, followed by legislative amendments of the Offshore Banking Act, the International&#13;
Business Companies Act, the International Exempt Trust Act and the Exempt Insurance Act in January&#13;
2001. A Money Laundering Supervisory Authority and a Financial Intelligence Unit were established&#13;
with technical assistance from Caribbean Anti-Money Laundering Programme, and are fully staffed and&#13;
operational.&#13;
The amendment to the Offshore Banking Act provided for the establishment of an Offshore&#13;
Financial Services Council, which has since recommended policy changes necessary to improve oversight&#13;
of the relevant financial institutions, currently six banks (three of which have trust operations) and one&#13;
exempt insurance company. Dominica was the first OECS country to fully share responsibility for&#13;
supervision with the ECCB, which also reviews and makes recommendations on new applications for&#13;
licences. The other amendments updated standing legislation and addressed key FATF concerns, in&#13;
particular by reducing the mobility of bearer shares, and opening up confidentiality shields. More&#13;
recently, in December 2001, the Government introduced the Exchange of Information Act that facilitates&#13;
the international exchange of information with other regulators and investigative bodies regarding all&#13;
types of offshore companies. The FATF has reported that Dominica has completed most of the legislative&#13;
reforms identified earlier as necessary to address the deficiencies. In October 2001, the authorities&#13;
submitted an implementation plan for review by the FATF. The main outstanding issues relate to&#13;
supervision of offshore trusts and international gaming, institutional strengthening in the International&#13;
Business Unit, and the separation of marketing from supervisory powers. Meanwhile, the Government is&#13;
considering a proposal to contract the marketing to the National Development Corporation.&#13;
Finally, Dominica has two Economic Citizenship programs, owing to various past changes to the&#13;
original program associated with different administrations. The first, which is now administered by the&#13;
International Business Unit, was suspended several times during 2000 under the current administration,&#13;
but is currently in effect. The second, which is governed by a long-standing contract between the&#13;
Government and an independent promoter, and is managed by the Ministry of Legal Affairs, was&#13;
suspended early in 2002. In light of recent events, both programs are currently under review by the Prime&#13;
Minister, who is also the Minister of Finance.&#13;

DOMINICA&#13;
Emergency Recovery Project&#13;
Schedule 1.B&#13;
Project Components, Estimated Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
1.1 Project components&#13;
1.1.1  Component 1: Critical Import (US$1,000,000)&#13;
This component will finance one critical import, namely low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity&#13;
generation, which is critical to maintaining economic activity in the tourism industry by ensuring that the&#13;
energy-intensive tourism facilities are kept operational during the recovery period. The inclusion of this&#13;
sole import is based on an assessment of Dominica's monthly import bill and review of satisfactory&#13;
procurement practices.&#13;
1.1.2  Component 2: Security Enhancement at ports and airports (US$2,207,000)&#13;
The cost estimates include design and supervision (US$20,000).&#13;
1.1.2.1 Physical Improvement of infrastructure&#13;
* Melville Hall International and Canefield International Airports Perimeter Fencing and Road&#13;
Improvement (US$965,000)&#13;
As the existing fencing along the perimeter of Melville Hall International Airport is damaged and not&#13;
in compliance with ICAO standards, it will need to be completely replaced. Approximately 2.5 miles of&#13;
perimeter fencing will be erected. At Canefield Airport, there is also a need to replace and/or&#13;
complement fencing over a length of approximately 1.2 miles.&#13;
In addition, at Melville Hall airport, a perimeter roadway of approximately 0.4 miles (including&#13;
drainage) will need to be constructed to enable the security vehicle to patrol the airport. Over a limited&#13;
portion of the Melville Airport perimeter, there is also a need to improve drainage conditions to enable&#13;
quick response to emergencies.&#13;
This cost estimate includes the provision of design and supervision.&#13;
* Construction of Baggage Screening Facilities at Melville Hall and Canefield International&#13;
Airports (US$70,000)&#13;
The second improvement that will be undertaken both at Melville Hall and Canefield International&#13;
Airports is the construction of an expansion or an enclosure to house the checked baggage screening&#13;
equipment and/or facilities. As ICAO moves toward 100 percent screening of checked bags, the airports&#13;
will need to house the required machinery and personnel to accomplish this task.&#13;
This cost estimate includes the provision of design and supervision.&#13;
1.1.2.2 Security Equipment&#13;
*  ID Badging and Tracking System (US$125,000)&#13;
At the Melville Hall International and Canefield Airports, there is a need to provide an electronic ID&#13;
badging system to facilitate the tracking of issued and cancelled IDs. A specialized equipment will be&#13;
financed under the project.&#13;
* Checked Baggage Screening Systems at Melville Hall International Airport(US$75,000)&#13;
Melville Hall International Airport presently has no operational checked-baggage screening systems.&#13;
As 100 percent screening of checked baggage is likely to become an ICAO requirement, one dual scanner&#13;
for checked bags will be purchased under the project.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* Passenger and Hand Baggage Screening Systems for the Airports (US 134,000)&#13;
Neither of the airports presently has an operational carry-on baggage screening system. Two&#13;
complete scanning stations (each station consisting of a baggage X-ray scanner, a walk-through&#13;
magnetometer (WTM), and an uninterrupted power supply system (UPS)) will be acquired, one for each&#13;
airport. In addition, ten (10) handheld metal detectors ("wands") will be acquired for use as secondary&#13;
portable screening devices.&#13;
* Airport and Port Security Patrol Vehicle (US$96,000)&#13;
Three four-wheel drive sport utility vehicles (SWV) will be financed by the project, allowing patrol of&#13;
terminal exterior, parking lots, airport operating area, and perimeter fencing for the two airports and the&#13;
port. These vehicles will enable patrols along improved roadways near the two airports and the port&#13;
perimeter fencing. They will also be equipped with light bars (per ICAO Standards for airport vehicles)&#13;
and communications equipment.&#13;
* Port Patrol Vessel (US$135,000)&#13;
In view of the high level of cruise ship travel into the Roseau port, there is inadequate surveillance of&#13;
commercial and private vessels near cruise ships that are docked at the port. The port needs the ability to&#13;
conduct regular and thorough patrols of both docking areas and the overall harbor area to deter and detect&#13;
any unlawful activity.&#13;
The project will finance a small port patrol boat capable of all-weather operations, to be staffed by&#13;
port security.&#13;
* Sniffers (US$65,000)&#13;
As no system is presently available for detecting the presence of chemicals and explosives, neither at&#13;
the airports nor at the ports, two electronic "sniffers" for chemical and explosive detection will be&#13;
financed. This estimate includes the housing of the equipment, and air-conditioning as appropriate.&#13;
*  Communications Equipment at the Airports and the Port (US$27,000)&#13;
Presently, very few of the security guards at both of the airports have hand-held radios to&#13;
communicate with each other or with other critical units, such as air traffic control, crash fire rescue&#13;
(CFR) crews, or police units.&#13;

1.1.2.3 Institutional Capacity Building (US$305,000)&#13;
This component is aimed at strengthening the countries' institutional capacity to devlop and&#13;
implement security plans, procedures and measures as mandated by international civil aviation and&#13;
maritime regulatory agencies. It will be implemented on a sub-regional basis by the OECS Directorate of&#13;
Civil Aviation and is financed on an equal share basis among all participating countries (US$305,000 per&#13;
country). The major elements of this component would be as follows:&#13;
(a) Training! (US$195,000)&#13;
A comprehensive security-training program for airports and seaports will be carried out based on a&#13;
common curriculum and uniform standard of proficiency for all OECS countries. Such a program is an&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
important companion piece to the acquisition of new equipment and the improvement of security-related&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
The program will consist of three elements: an executive training course, a series of security&#13;
operations training courses and a specialized training about crisis management and security regulations&#13;
expected to be attended out of the country.&#13;
Executive Trainine (US$15,000)&#13;
This two-day training program will be oriented toward the top management of the security&#13;
operations at OECS airports and seaports. This training course will bring all security executives to a high&#13;
and common level of management capability, and ensure their understanding of the training to be&#13;
received by their subordinates in the security operations training courses. The executive training will&#13;
occur before any of the security operations training courses so that the input of the top management can&#13;
be taken into consideration in the preparation of the security operations training courses.&#13;
Two trainers from outside the region will conduct the course, which will be held in Antigua. The&#13;
OECS Directorate of Civil Aviation will serve as host and coordinator of arrangements and will&#13;
participate in the program as appropriate.&#13;
The executive training program will cover the following topics:&#13;
*  Current Context: A presentation and discussion of the current security situation in the Eastern&#13;
Caribbean, particularly in the light of the events of September 11, 2001 will be provided. The&#13;
position of the OECS countries as key components of the international aviation network, with&#13;
extensive ties to the North American, European, and Latin American markets, will also be&#13;
discussed.&#13;

*  Security Management: This section will address the "how's and why's" of managing a&#13;
transportation security organization, including personnel, technology and asset management&#13;
issues.&#13;
*  Security Coordination: Because transportation security organizations are parts of larger&#13;
organizations and global security efforts, coordination of security functions within the "big&#13;
picture" are critical.&#13;
o Internal: How different components within the security transportation organization&#13;
can work together to improve security.&#13;
o External: - How to coordinate transportation security functions with police, national&#13;
defense, and international organizations, such as the RSS and Interpol.&#13;
o  Airlines and Cruise Lines: How to work with tenant and itinerant air carriers and&#13;
cruise lines to develop effective security and response measures, avoiding duplicity&#13;
of efforts.&#13;
* Crisis Management: Development of crisis management teams, plans and contingencies to&#13;
ensure faster and more efficient response during actual crises. This section will focus on the&#13;
development of such measures and a discussion of working models for success.&#13;
* Technology Familiarization: An overview of existing and future technologies in&#13;
transportation security, including specific instruction on equipment to be procured within the&#13;
OECS countries.&#13;
*  Preview of Security Operations Training: An overview of the training to be received by the&#13;
operational security personnel, including screening, detection and prevention measures.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Security Operations Trainin! (US$100,000)&#13;
This three-day training program will be conducted for personnel that perform the day-to-day&#13;
security operations at the airports and the seaports. It will be carried out twice, to allow for all relevant&#13;
personnel to be trained. The objective of this training course is to bring all security operations officers&#13;
and related staff to a common level of proficiency and operational capability. The emphasis of this course&#13;
is on the direct, hands-on capabilities of security personnel at the airports and seaports.&#13;
Two trainers from outside the region will conduct the courses, in cooperation with local law&#13;
enforcement training personnel as appropriate. In addition to a common level of training that all&#13;
participants in the training courses, regardless of location, will receive in the OECS, a local component&#13;
will be integrated to ensure compatibility with the national and particular situation of each country.&#13;
The executive training program will cover the following topics:&#13;
*  Threat Identification: Understanding and identifying specific and general threats to&#13;
transportation security, and the specific measures to be taken under varying threat levels.&#13;
* Response Measures:&#13;
o Crisis Response: How to respond in the event of an actual crisis or security breach.&#13;
o Response Coordination: How to coordinate a response to a breach in security,&#13;
including coordination with security management, police forces, and passenger&#13;
carriers.&#13;
o Seizure of Weapons: How to seize detected weapons and/or dangerous articles from&#13;
passengers, including legal and regulatory issues that may arise.&#13;
o Isolation of Dangerous Items: How to isolate dangerous items and real or suspected&#13;
explosive devices once detected. How to best protect both passengers and security&#13;
personnel following detection of a possible weapon or explosive device.&#13;
*  Public Relations: This section will discuss security personnel's role as ambassadors of both&#13;
their facilities and countries. Specific tips on how to present a professional and friendly&#13;
appearance, while also demonstrating a strong security presence will be provided.&#13;
*  Surveillance and Patrol: An overview of techniques for patrolling and surveillance of&#13;
facilities and their perimeters using a variety of methods, vehicles, and technologies.&#13;
*  Operation of Security Equipment:&#13;
o Screening Equipment: The operation of screening devices for both hand-held and&#13;
checked baggage, including the identification of suspicious items and weapons. This&#13;
training will focus on the specific operation of machines to be acquired or presently&#13;
in operation.&#13;
o  Magnetometers: How to most effectively use both walk-through and handheld&#13;
magnetometers to detect metallic objects, including actual or potential weapons.&#13;
o Equipment Performance Issues: This section will provide an overview of the&#13;
underlying technologies behind the various screening devices, and their quirks,&#13;
sensitivities and potential for false positive or negative readings. Identification of&#13;
faults, potential maintenance problems, and other performance issues will also be&#13;
presented. Lastly, a brief presentation on radiation dosimeters and other safety&#13;
equipment will be given.&#13;
* Secondary Screening Measures:&#13;

Schedule 1.C&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Project Coordination and Management&#13;
Project Coordination will be the responsibility of Project Coordination Unit (PCU), established&#13;
under the Ministry of Communications, Works and Housing (MOCWH) for the Implementation of the&#13;
Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project. The PCU will be responsible for managing the&#13;
different aspects of the project, coordinating implementing agencies, keeping accounts, and reporting to&#13;
the Bank. The PCU already includes, on a full time basis, a project coordinator, an accountant and a&#13;
project assistant. Financing will be provided under the project to cover the cost of one accountant&#13;
assistant, and to extend the contracts of the existing PCU staff from June 2003 through June 2005.&#13;
The civil works and equipment elements of the security enhancement component will be&#13;
implemented by the Airport and Seaport Authorities. To this end, this agency will designate a contact&#13;
person who will work closely under the auspices and the supervision of the PCU and will provide&#13;
progress reports to the PCU on a quarterly basis. The PCU will handle the procurement and contract&#13;
management responsibilities for these components on behalf of the Airport and Seaport Authorities.&#13;
While training in the use of security equipment financed under the project will be included in&#13;
each contract and provided by suppliers, specialized training and technical assistance in security&#13;
management, safety, contingency planning, and crisis management, will be carried out through the OECS&#13;
Directorate of Civil Aviation under a separate regional agreement. The OECS Directorate of Civil&#13;
Aviation will ensure the development and implementation of training and technical assistance activities&#13;
on a regional basis.&#13;
The Critical Import component will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.&#13;
All supporting documentation required for disbursements will be assembled by the PCU with the&#13;
assistance of the Customs Department. The PCU will prepare a consolidated quarterly progress report on&#13;
all project activities and submit it to the Bank.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
The civil works under this project consist of: (i) the installation of new fencings at the Melville&#13;
Hall and Canefield International Airports; (ii) the construction of an addition to the existing terminal of a&#13;
new free-standing facility to house screening equipment for checked baggage both at Melville Hall and&#13;
Canefield Airports; (iii) the construction of a roadway including drainage works along a section of the&#13;
perimeter of Melville Hall Airport airfield to permit vehicle patrol. Given the nature and expected size of&#13;
the works, national competitive bidding (NCB) would be used with the possibility for foreign firms to&#13;
participate. Advertisement for these works will be made through the announcement of the project in the&#13;
general procurement notice and an announcement in a local newspaper of wide distribution. The total&#13;
estimated costs of these works are expected to range from US$40,000 to US$925,000 up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$1,035,000. Small works estimated to cost less than US$100,000 individually would be&#13;
procured using three quotations obtained from qualified contractors.&#13;
Goods and Equipment&#13;
Equipment under the project consist of: (i) ID badging/tracking system at Melville Hall Airport;&#13;
(ii) baggage screening systems including walk-through metal detectors, uninterrupted power system units,&#13;
handheld metal detectors and sniffers ;(iii) close-circuit television systems; (iv) airport security patrol&#13;
vehicles and seaport patrol boat; (v) small communication system equipment such as hand-held radios,&#13;

13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
respectively will be carried out through ICB procedures. All equipment contracts will include installation&#13;
or supervision of installation, training on the equipment operation and maintenance, as appropriate.&#13;
International and/or national shopping procedures- would be used for the procurement of the&#13;
communication and small equipment estimated to cost up to an aggregate amount of US$128,000. The&#13;
procurement of the patrol boat estimated at a cost of US$135,000 will be made through limited&#13;
international bidding or international shopping.&#13;
Critical Import&#13;
The main critical import will consist of low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation estimated&#13;
to cost US$1,000,000 and will be procured following established commercial practices found acceptable&#13;
by the Bank and for which disbursement would be made on the basis of agreed import documentation.&#13;
Consultant Services&#13;
Consultants' services consist of: (i) engineering design and supervision for the civil works&#13;
components (buildings, roadways, and fences, etc.), (ii) the hiring of consulting firms or individuals for&#13;
the design and implementation of the Security training program, (iii) technical assistance, (iv) additional&#13;
staff for the PCU, and (v) auditors for the project accounts. The hiring of firms will be made using quality&#13;
and cost-based selection (QCBS) and the hiring of individuals will be made using selection based on&#13;
qualifications.&#13;
Prior Review&#13;
All ICB will require prior review by the Bank. Two copies of the signed contracts should be sent&#13;
to the Bank prior to requesting disbursements against these contracts. The first two NCB procurements&#13;
for civil works, the first two procurements of smaller works and the first procurement of goods under&#13;
local or international shopping will require prior review. All consultants' services estimated to cosf above&#13;
US$50,000 will be subject to prior review and all services estimated to cost less than US$50,000 will&#13;
require the prior review of the TORs, contract and CVs.&#13;

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Implementing Entities&#13;
The Ministry of Communications, Works and Housing (MOCWH) currently implements the Emergency&#13;
Recovery and Disaster Management project with an established Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and will&#13;
be the implementing entity to coordinate all activities under this project. Regarding the financial&#13;
management arrangements, the PCU has appointed a qualified accountant (who has worked with the&#13;
current Disaster Management project) to oversee all aspects of financial management for the project. This&#13;
staff member will also liaise with the Office of the Accountant General and Customs Department for&#13;
matters of consolidation of documentation for critical imports and accounting information, and for&#13;
monitoring the flow of funds to the project.&#13;
The PCU in the MOCWH has an adequate financial management system. It has recently received&#13;
training in the Bank's (new) financial management requirements and is currently successfully operating&#13;
under PMR-based disbursements.&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
Procedures for flow of funds from the loan and the required counterpart contribution will be implemented&#13;
with due regard to safeguarding project's resources and ensuring timely execution of payments.&#13;
Loan funds will be disbursed to one Special Account (US dollar account for Bank funds), and this account&#13;
will be utilized for the purposes of the implementation arrangements agreed. As is the current practice in&#13;
Dominica, the Special Account will be opened by the Ministry of Communications, Works and Housing&#13;
(MOCWH) and maintained in a commercial bank. The management of this account will be the&#13;
responsibility of the PCU. The PCU will transfer funds from the Special Account to the project account,&#13;
from which checks or transfers (in local currency) will be issued to the providers of goods and services.&#13;
The project will reconcile (monthly) both the project account as well as the Special Account, and submit&#13;
the documentation regarding both accounts, to the Bank under each withdrawal application and Financial&#13;
Monitoring Reports (FMRs).&#13;
The Ministry of Finance and Planning will prepare a Special Appropriations Warrant to request project&#13;
funding for the first year of implementation, and it is expected that subsequent project funding&#13;
requirements will be included in future govemment budget and planning estimates. The Govemment of&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Dominica will allocate its counterpart funding (US$300,000 for 2002-03 and US$369,500 for 2003-04)&#13;
into a local operational project account.&#13;
The establishment of the new Special Account and the deposit of Government's first year contribution in&#13;
the local operational account will be required prior to effectiveness.&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
Administrative procedures are in place to ensure that financial transactions are made with consideration to&#13;
safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry in the accounting/monitoring systems. The project&#13;
accounting system has the capacity to record assets, liabilities and financial transactions of the project,&#13;
and produce financial statements useful to project management and meeting IBRD's fiduciary&#13;
requirements. The accounting system is designed to be able to capture all financial information and&#13;
allocate among both categories (the Bank's legal/disbursement categories and GOD Budget categories)&#13;
and project activity.&#13;
The project will also submit detailed monthly statements of expenditures to the Office of the Accountant&#13;
General and to the MOCWH in order that the project's expenditures are recorded on the Ministry's&#13;
accounts as well as supervised by the unit responsible for management of external financing.&#13;
Accounting. Accounting and budgetary records will be maintained in accordance with the GOD's&#13;
procedures, under the FAA Act and which are satisfactory to the Bank. However, for Bank monitoring&#13;
purposes the PCU will report on detailed information at the project level, specifically the deposits to the&#13;
special account and the expenditures classified by activity/ subcomponent and disbursement category.&#13;
The project has implemented a basic system that will be able to account for all financial transactions by&#13;
source of financing and by either general category or project activity detail.&#13;
Safeguard over assets. For the proposed project, the PCU will keep detailed subsidiary records of plant&#13;
and equipment acquired. The amounts in this register will be reconciled monthly against the respective&#13;
accounting balances. At least one annual physical inspection will be undertaken by MOCWH/PCU staff,&#13;
preferably with the participation of staff from the external auditors and the Auditor General's Department.&#13;
External Audit&#13;
Audit arrangements. Annual project financial statements will be audited in accordance with&#13;
International Standards on Auditing, by an independent firm and in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
(TORs) both acceptable to the Bank. In addition to the audit opinions on project financial statements,&#13;
Special Accounts and FMRs, special purpose reports will be required to deal specifically with observance&#13;
of the procurement and consultants services provisions of the Loan Agreement. The memorandum on&#13;
internal controls ("management letter") will be issued annually.&#13;
The Terms of Reference for the independent annual audit has already been cleared and approved by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
The PCU will prepare, if needed, an action plan to address any issues and recommendations contained in&#13;
the audit reports. The action plan and follow-up activities would be communicated to the Bank.&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
Financial statements and reports will be prepared in formats satisfying the Government and IBRD's&#13;
monitoring and fiduciary purposes.&#13;
On a monthly basis (at least), the PCU will prepare the project's basic Statement of Expenditure, a matrix&#13;
classifying receipts by financing source and expenditures by financing source and disbursement (or&#13;
government expenditure) category. This report is submitted to the Office of the Accountant General and&#13;
to the Ministry of Finance and Planning.&#13;
In addition to Statement of Expenditure, the monthly financial reports will include the Special Account&#13;
Reconciliation Statements. Any difference in the amount of expenditures reported under the two financial&#13;
statements must be clearly explained. The project financial statements, along with the physical progress&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and procurement sections of the FMRs, will be submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis, and will be&#13;
submitted no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarter. The contents of the FMRs have&#13;
been discussed, and the formats of the reports will be finalized by loan negotiations.&#13;
The PCU will be responsible to liaise with the Directorate of Civil Aviation (the DCA, located in&#13;
Antigua) to consolidate the accounting and procurement information of the Training and Technical&#13;
Component, which will be implemented by the DCA. The PCU will receive each month a copy of the&#13;
Special Account reconciliation and a detailed monthly Statement of Expenditure. The PCU is also&#13;
responsible to include this information in the FMRs submitted to the Bank each quarter. The PCU will&#13;
maintain copies of all financial transactions and relevant documentation and the annual audit for the PCU&#13;
will cover this component implemented by the DCA.&#13;

EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Schedule 2.A&#13;
Economic Impact and Recovery Program&#13;
Impact on the tourism sector. Following September 11, Grenada saw a decline in stayover&#13;
arrivals (which generate over 95 percent of overall tourism earnings) on the order of 10 percentage points&#13;
below trends observed through the first eight months of 2001. As a result, hotel occupancy rates have&#13;
fallen significantly, despite sharp discounting. There have been widespread reductions in shift hours for&#13;
the current workforce as hotels have generally tried to avoid outright layoffs. Looking forward,&#13;
worldwide tourism is not projected to recover fully until mid- to end-2002. Given the authorities'&#13;
increased promotional efforts as part of the recovery program, and widespread discounting by hotels as&#13;
well as air and cruise lines, Grenada expects to see a modest recovery in 2002. Total tourist arrivals are&#13;
projected to grow by 2.6 percent over 2001 levels, although still remaining under the levels reached in&#13;
2000. This compares with a counterfactual scenario - in the imagined absence of the September 11&#13;
events - of around 3.2 percent growth in overall tourist arrivals in 2002.&#13;

Overall impact. It is estimated that, relative to a reasonable counterfactual scenario, the sector&#13;
lost around EC$20 million, or 8 percent of annual tourism revenue, in the last four months of 2001 alone.&#13;
In 2002, it is projected that the sector will lose around EC$30 million (about US$11 million) in revenues&#13;
relative to the counterfactual scenario. Lower foreign exchange earnings from tourism and other sources,&#13;
though partly compensated by a reduced level of tourist-related imports, are estimated to have had a&#13;
negative impact on the external current account balance - relative to the counterfactual scenario - of&#13;
US$7 million (1.7 percent of GDP) in 2001, and are projected to have a negative impact of US$10 million&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(2.3 percent of GDP) in 2002. The economy, which was expected to slow down to 0.6 percent real&#13;
growth in 2001, largely on account of slower manufacturing and construction sector activity, is now&#13;
estimated to have contracted by 1.4 percent. The economy is expected to make a strong recovery in 2002,&#13;
partly based on a gradual recovery in tourist arrivals. Real GDP growth is projected to be around&#13;
3 percent, compared with the counterfactual scenario of 3.4 percent. The fiscal accounts have also been&#13;
negatively affected and the Government has taken some measures to address deterioration - the combined&#13;
impact is discussed below.&#13;
Tourism recovery efforts. A large part of Grenada's promotional effort is directed at increasing&#13;
airlift to the island, a major bottleneck for the industry. The Government, in conjunction with the&#13;
Grenada Hotel and Tourism Association and the National Tourism Action Campaign, has guaranteed&#13;
seats on a new charter from the UK, to replace one which discontinued service in June 2001.&#13;
Additionally, the Government's Airlift Committee has recently resumed negotiations with USAir on a&#13;
proposed direct service from Philadelphia, and with a European charter firm on a new service from&#13;
Amsterdam. Following the September 11 events, the start dates of both operations were postponed, but&#13;
the authorities now expect negotiations to be concluded shortly. In addition, negotiations are still&#13;
underway with Air Jamaica and BWIA, which could double the available seats from New York and add&#13;
three new direct flights from Miami, respectively. However, each of these proposals requires the&#13;
authorities to share the cost of marketing programs with the airlines. With a limited promotional budget,&#13;
the Grenada Board of Tourism has had to make some very difficult choices in a year in which airlift was&#13;
crucial to safeguarding their market. In particular, without the US$500,000 to guarantee seats on the&#13;
struggling Canadian charters, Signature Vacations and Conquest, Grenada lost all of its direct service&#13;
from that market, and saw a 50 percent decline in Canadian arrivals in December 2001.&#13;
In terms of promotions, Grenada extended its Let's go, Grenada! campaign targeted at the&#13;
Caribbean market through the last quarter of 2001. This market, although traditionally made up of lower&#13;
spenders, has been growing recently. Grenada is also participating in the Regional Tourism Emergency&#13;
Programme. The Government's share of the cost of this program, which amounts to US$197,500, is&#13;
being financed with a concessional loan from the CDB.&#13;
Regarding the cruise sub-sector, Grenada recently suffered the pullout of a major line that made&#13;
year-round calls, and reductions in frequency of visits by two other vessels from 17 to 12 calls per year.&#13;
The Government is in the process of contracting a private firm to develop and implement a marketing&#13;
plan to increase the number of cruise ship calls, in particular from smaller independent lines. In addition,&#13;
work will start this year on the planned new cruise ship terminal (a joint venture project of the port&#13;
authority and Swiss investors, estimated to cost US$25 million) which will enable Grenada to&#13;
accommodate larger ships. The Government also recently passed a Yachting Act, aimed at taking&#13;
advantage of Grenada's location outside the "hurricane belt" by providing a regulatory framework for the&#13;
expansion of that sector. The signs are promising: Grenada already has four applications for new marinas&#13;
to complement the two currently in place and expanding, and two others under construction.&#13;
For the hotel sector, the Government has offered to help negotiate relief on charges from the&#13;
private power utility and telephone company. However, the authorities have been quite conservative on&#13;
fiscal relief measures, and will not consider any sector-wide waivers of taxes in the hospitality or hotel&#13;
sectors. In January 2002, the Government embarked on a review of all its fiscal incentives programs with&#13;
the intention of modernizing the entire framework, including better enforcement of the requirements for&#13;
recipient firms, and to introduce appropriate incentives for the development of an information technology&#13;
sector. Finally, on the investment side, the Government has allocated EC$I million of its capital program&#13;
toward improving roads specifically related to tourism sites and accommodation facilities.&#13;
Expanding social programs. In light of the economic situation following September 11, the&#13;
Government has made a conscious effort to expand social programs which aim to increase the income-&#13;
generating capacity of the poor and to provide assistance to the vulnerable. In 2002, Grenada will expand&#13;
skills training programs by: (i) increasing the allocation for the National Training and Employment&#13;
program directed at unemployed youth from EC$325,000 to EC$1 million; (ii) doubling its Special&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Projects Program, which finances income generation projects in economically disadvantaged areas, to&#13;
EC$5 million; (iii) re-focusing the CDB-financed Basic Needs Trust Fund on skills training for income&#13;
generation and increasing its counterpart allocation by 40 percent; and (iv) launching a new rural&#13;
enterprise project funded jointly by CDB and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. To&#13;
complement these efforts, the Government will maintain its Human Resources Development Program,&#13;
which provides financial assistance for tuition, books, uniforms and in some cases transportation&#13;
allowance for secondary and tertiary students from low income households, up to EC$1.5 million. The&#13;
Government will expand its social protection program by introducing a new transportation program&#13;
(EC$0.9 million) for the elderly, and a new program to finance water connections for poor households, as&#13;
public standpipes are phased out to reduce losses and improve the financial viability of the National&#13;
Water and Sewerage Authority.&#13;
Fiscal measures. In order to finance increased expenditure related to tourism promotion,&#13;
security arrangements, and additional social support during the recovery period, the Government has&#13;
taken several measures aimed at both raising resources and containing non-essential expenditures. The&#13;
strategy is to finance additional expenditures through revenue reforms and tightening recurrent spending,&#13;
rather than through increased borrowing. An employment freeze which has been in place since 1996,&#13;
except for key social sector positions, will be continued. The Government will raise a number of user&#13;
fees, including motor vehicle licences, some by more than 100 percent, and will raise the property tax.&#13;
The latter measure is expected to yield around EC$1.3 million in new revenues. The authorities will also&#13;
continue their commercialization of various central government functions, with Grenada has been&#13;
pursuing successfully in recent years. As a result of these new measures, it is expected the overall impact&#13;
on the fiscal accounts can be contained to about EC$7.6 million (US$2.8 million) in 2001 and&#13;
EC$23.3 million (US$8.6 million) in 2002.&#13;
Strengthening oversight of the offshore sector. The Grenadian authorities have taken several&#13;
measures aimed at improving administration and supervision of its off-shore sector.' Near the end of&#13;
2000, the Government expanded the Grenada Financial Services Authority, which is responsible for the&#13;
regulation of the offshore sector, to include a Bank Supervisor and a separate department for handling&#13;
banks, trusts, insurance companies and international gaming. Preparations are being made to cede more&#13;
responsibility to the ECCB in terms of licensing, intelligence and due diligence regarding offshore&#13;
financial operations. Several key pieces of legislation were amended in June 2001, in particular to reduce&#13;
the mobility of bearer shares, restrict earlier confidentiality protections, and increase fines and penalties&#13;
associated with financial malfeasance. The country has also recently strengthened its Anti-Money&#13;
Laundering Supervisory Authority and Financial Intelligence Unit.  On the basis of the recently&#13;
completed IMF-assisted self-assessment on the off-shore sector, the authorities are now discussing the&#13;
future of the sector with industry stakeholders. On a related matter, following the September 11 events,&#13;
Grenada suspended its Economic Citizenship program on October 24, 2001. It is estimated that this move&#13;
will cost the Government just under EC$6 million in annual revenues.&#13;
' At the time of writing, Grenada had 3668 off-shore IBCs, 22 off-shore banks, three trust companies, five international insurance&#13;
companies, and one off-shore gaming operation.&#13;

Emergency Recovery Project&#13;
Schedule 2.B&#13;
Project Components, Estimated Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
1.1 Project components&#13;
1.1.1  Component 1: Critical Import (US$1,500,000)&#13;
This component will finance one critical import, low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation,&#13;
which is critical to maintaining economic activity in the tourism industry by ensuring that the energy-&#13;
intensive tourism facilities are kept operational during the recovery period. The inclusion of this sole&#13;
import is based on an assessment of Grenada's monthly import bill and review of satisfactory&#13;
procurement practices.&#13;
1.1.2 Component 2: Security Enhancement at ports and airports (US$2,525,000)&#13;
These cost estimates include design and supervision (US$36,000).&#13;
1.1.2.1 Physical Improvement of infrastructure&#13;
* Point Salines Airport Fencing (US$500,000)&#13;
As portions of the west-end perimeter fencing are damaged, missing, or incomplete, it is essential that&#13;
an effort be made to provide ICAO-compliant perimeter fencing in that area. Although the seaside terrain&#13;
in this area is rocky and difficult to navigate, trespassing on airport grounds is frequent. The area is&#13;
difficult to patrol and is not entirely visible from the tower.&#13;
Approximately three miles of the airport's perimeter, facing the ocean, is unfenced. Approximately&#13;
two miles of this unfenced perimeter is not visible from the ATC tower, and a portion of this same area&#13;
contains thick vegetation between the runway area and the beach. The project will finance the erection of&#13;
perimeter fencing in certain areas of the waterside of the airport perimeter.&#13;
*  Construction of Checked Bajzage Screening Annex in Point Salines Airport (US$300,000)&#13;
The second capital improvement that will be undertaken at Point Salines International Airport is the&#13;
improvement of the east wing of the terminal building to house screening equipment for checked&#13;
baggage. Because of physical constraints at the current terminal, there is currently no functional area to&#13;
house screening devices for checked baggage. As ICAO moves toward 100 percent screening of checked&#13;
bags, the airport will need to house the required machinery and personnel to accomplish this task.&#13;
The Government has proposed that the existing east wing of the terminal can be modified to&#13;
accommodate insertion of a double checked-bag screening point. Such a configuration would have&#13;
passengers present their bags for screening prior to check-in, and the bags would be automatically bound&#13;
with a security strap upon completion of the screening.&#13;
1.1.2.2 Security Equipment&#13;
* Checked Baggage Screening Systems in Point Salines Airport (US$150,000)&#13;
The airport presently has no operational checked-baggage screening systems, although one airline is&#13;
planning to use its own equipment for this purpose, for its own operations. As 100 percent screening of&#13;
checked baggage is likely to become an ICAO requirement, two new screening units will be purchased&#13;
for use in the annex or addition to be constructed, as discussed above.&#13;
* ID Badging and Tracking System (US$250,000)&#13;
The authorities presently issue identification (ID) credentials manually, and maintain the airport and&#13;
port IDs in a physical file. This makes tracking and cancellation of issued IDs difficult and time-&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
consuming. It has also resulted in a system where persons who should no longer possess access to port&#13;
and airport facilities still maintain authorized IDs.&#13;
The project will finance the acquisition of two systems (one for the port, one for the airport) that will&#13;
automate the issuance, tracking, and cancellation of IDs for personnel.&#13;
*  Passenger and Hand Baggage Screening Systems for the Airport and the Port (US$335,000)&#13;
Point Salines airport presently has two operational walk-through magnetometers (WTM) and two&#13;
operational X-ray screening machines for passengers' carry-on baggage, although both are more than four&#13;
years old, and one is frequently out of service. Two complete scanning stations (each station consisting of&#13;
a baggage x-ray scanner, a WTM, and an uninterrupted power supply system (UPS)) will be acquired.&#13;
Ten (10) handheld metal detectors ("wands") will also be acquired for use as secondary portable&#13;
screening devices.&#13;
In addition, another screening station will be acquired for in-transit passengers and their carry-on&#13;
baggage. This would consist of the same equipment as the passenger and hand baggage screening system&#13;
detailed above.&#13;
Lastly, Saint George Port does not presently possess the capability to screen cruise passengers or their&#13;
carry-on baggage for weapons or other dangerous articles. Two complete scanning stations and ten (10)&#13;
handheld metal detectors (same description and conditions of usage as above) will be acquired for use at&#13;
the port.&#13;
* Airport Security Patrol Vehicle (US$32,000)&#13;
One four-wheel drive sport utility vehicle (SUV) will be financed by the project, to enable the&#13;
patrolling of the terminal exterior, parking lots, airport operating area, and perimeter fencing. This&#13;
vehicle will enable patrols along unimproved roadways near the airport perimeter fencing. It will also be&#13;
equipped with light bars (per ICAO Standards for airport vehicles) and communications equipment.&#13;
*  Sniffers (US$130,000)&#13;
As no system is presently available for detecting the presence of chemicals and explosives, neither at&#13;
the airport nor at the port, two electronic "sniffers" for chemical and explosive detection will be financed.&#13;
This estimate includes the housing of the equipment, and air-conditioning as appropriate.&#13;
* Main Gate Access Control in St George Port (US$75,000)&#13;
The present primary entrance gate at the port is manually operated by guards and requires extra&#13;
human resources that could be much better applied in actual patrol of the port facilities. An new electronic&#13;
gate, financed by the project, will provide both relief of personnel to perform other security-related duties&#13;
and a mean for electronically tracking gate access.&#13;
* Communications Equipment at the Airport (US$12,000)&#13;
Presently, very few of the security guards at the airport have hand-held radios to communicate with&#13;
each other or with other critical units, such as air traffic control, crash fire rescue (CFR) crews, or police&#13;
units. A minimum of eight (8) hand-held units will be purchased, along with one repeater unit and two&#13;
vehicle-mounted units. The costs of extra batteries and battery charging units have been factored in to the&#13;
above estimates.&#13;
* Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) System ($416,000)&#13;
The port and the airport presently have a CCTV system in operation, though some cameras are&#13;
inoperative and there are frequent "blind" spots where camera coverage is not available. The project will&#13;
finance the acquisition of twenty (20) additional cameras, monitors and VCRs to provide more complete&#13;
coverage in areas where continual guard presence is not possible, both at the port and the airport.&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.1.2.3 Institutional Capacity Building (US$305,000 per country)&#13;
This regional component is financed and implemented on an equal share basis among all&#13;
participating countries (US$305,000 per country) and includes the provision of Executive Training&#13;
(US$15,000), Security Operations Training (US$100,000), Specialized Training (US$80,000), Technical&#13;
Assistance for Regulatory Review for Enhanced Security (US$95,000), and Short-term Procurement&#13;
Services (US$15,000). The detailed description of each element of the regional training component is&#13;
given in Schedule 1.B.&#13;
1.1.3 Component 3: Project Management (US$235,000)&#13;
This component is aimed at assisting Government in meeting its project management obligations&#13;
through the strengthening of the existing Project Coordination Unit. A Procurement Assistant and an&#13;
Accountant Assistant will be hired under the loan/credit proceeds for two years (US$60,000). The&#13;
services of the Accountant will be extended by about 16 months (US$50,000).&#13;
This component will also provide financing for office equipment (US$20,000) and other&#13;
operating expenditures for the PCU (US$30,000), as well as for financial audits (US$75,000) of the entire&#13;
project every fiscal year.&#13;
1.2 Estimated costs&#13;
The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$4,500,000. Detailed cost&#13;
estimates are given in Table 2.B.1.&#13;
1.3 Financing plan&#13;
Out of a total cost of US$4,500,000, the Bank will finance US$3,800,000 (84 percent of the total&#13;
project cost) and the balance (US$700,000) will be financed by the Government. Bank financing will&#13;
consist of a US$1.14 million loan and a SDR2.2 million credit. Financing details are given in Table&#13;
2.B.2.&#13;

Schedule 2.C&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Project Coordination and Management&#13;
Project Coordination will be the responsibility of Project Coordination Unit (PCU), established&#13;
under the Ministry of Finance and Planning for the Implementation of the Emergency Recovery and&#13;
Disaster Management Project. The PCU will be responsible for managing the different aspects of the&#13;
project, coordinating implementing agencies, keeping accounts, and reporting to the Bank. The PCU&#13;
already includes, on a full time basis, a project coordinator, an assistant project coordinator/procurement&#13;
officer, an accountant and an administrative assistant. Financing will be provided under the project to&#13;
cover the cost of one procurement assistant and one accountant assistant, as well as the extension of the&#13;
accountant's contract for about 16 months.&#13;
The civil works and equipment elements of the security enhancement component will be&#13;
implemented by the respective Airport and Seaport Authorities. To this end, these agencies will designate&#13;
a contact person who will work closely under the auspices and the supervision of the PCU and will&#13;
provide progress reports to the PCU on a quarterly basis. The Procurement Officer of the PCU will&#13;
handle the procurement and contract management responsibilities for these components on behalf of the&#13;
relevant implementing agencies.&#13;
While training in the use of security equipment financed under the project will be included in&#13;
each contract and provided by suppliers, specialized training and technical assistance in security&#13;
management, safety, contingency planning, and crisis management, will be carried out through the OECS&#13;
Directorate of Civil Aviation under a separate regional agreement. The OECS Directorate of Civil&#13;
Aviation will ensure the development and implementation of training and technical assistance activities&#13;
on a regional basis.&#13;
The Critical Import component will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.&#13;
All supporting documentation required for disbursements will be assembled by the PCU with the&#13;
assistance of the Customs Department. The PCU will prepare a consolidated quarterly progress report on&#13;
all project activities and submit it to the Bank.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
The civil works under this project consist of: (i) the installation of a new perimeter fencing at&#13;
Point Saline Airport; (ii) Improvements to the East wing of the terminal building to house screening&#13;
equipment for checked baggage. Given the nature and expected size of the works, national competitive&#13;
bidding (NCB) would be used with the possibility for foreign firms to participate. Advertisement for&#13;
these works will be made through the announcement of the project in the general procurement notice and&#13;
an announcement in a local newspaper of wide distribution. The total estimated costs of these works are&#13;
expected to range from US$300,000 to US$500,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$800,000. Small&#13;
works estimated to cost less than US$100,000 individually would be procured using three quotations&#13;
obtained from qualified contractors.&#13;
Goods and Ecuipment&#13;
Equipment under the project consist of: (i) ID badging/tracking system and passenger tracking&#13;
and watch list system; (ii) baggage screening systems including walk-through metal detectors,&#13;
uninterrupted power system units, handheld metal detectors and sniffers; (iii) close-circuit television&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(ii) and (iii) above with estimated aggregate costs of US$250,000, US$615,000, and US$400,000&#13;
respectively will be carried out through ICB procedures. All equipment contracts will include installation&#13;
or supervision of installation, training on the equipment operation and maintenance, as appropriate.&#13;
Intemational and/or national shopping procedures would be used for the procurement of the&#13;
communication, small equipment and electronic gate estimated to cost up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$107,000. The patrol vehicle, estimated to cost US$ 32,000, will be procured through IAPSO.&#13;
Critical Import&#13;
The main critical import will consist of low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation estimated&#13;
to cost US$1,500,000 and will be procured following established commercial practices found acceptable&#13;
by the Bank and for which disbursement would be made on the basis of agreed import documentation.&#13;
Consultant Services&#13;
Consultants' services consist of: (i) engineering design and supervision for the civil works&#13;
components (buildings, roadways, and fences, etc.), and (ii) the hiring of consulting firms or individuals&#13;
for the design and implementation of the Security training program. The hiring of firms will be made&#13;
using quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) and the hiring of individuals will be made using selection&#13;
based on qualifications.&#13;
Prior Review&#13;
All ICB will require prior review by the Bank. Two copies of the signed contracts should be sent&#13;
to the Bank prior to requesting disbursements against these contracts. The first two NCB procurements&#13;
for civil works, the first two procurements of smaller works and the first procurement of goods under&#13;
local or international shopping will require prior review. All consultants' services estimated to cost above&#13;
US$50,000 will be subject to prior review and all services estimated to cost less than US$50,000 will&#13;
require the prior review of the TORs, contract and CVs.&#13;

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Implementing Entities&#13;
The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) currently implements the Emergency Recovery and&#13;
Disaster Management project with an established Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and will be the&#13;
implementing entity to coordinate all activities under this project. Regarding the financial management&#13;
arrangements, the PCU has appointed a qualified accountant (who has worked with the current Disaster&#13;
Management project) to oversee all aspects of financial management for the project. This staff member&#13;
will also liaise with the Office of the Accountant General and Customs Department for matters of&#13;
consolidation of documentation for critical imports and accounting information, and for monitoring the&#13;
flow of funds to the project.&#13;
The PCU has an adequate financial management system. It has recently received training in the Bank's&#13;
(new) financial management requirements and is currently successfully operating under PMR-based&#13;
disbursements.&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
Procedures for flow of funds from the loan and the required counterpart contribution will be implemented&#13;
with due regard to safeguarding project's resources and ensuring timely execution of payments.&#13;
Loan funds will be disbursed to one Special Account (US dollar account for Bank funds), and this account&#13;
will be utilized for the purposes of the implementation arrangements agreed. As is the current practice in&#13;
Grenada, the Special Account will be opened by the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) and&#13;
maintained in a commercial bank. The management of this account will be the responsibility of the PCU.&#13;
The PCU will transfer funds from the Special Account to the project account, from which checks or&#13;
transfers (in local currency) will be issued to the providers of goods and services. The project will&#13;
reconcile (monthly) both the project account as well as the Special Account, and submit the&#13;
documentation regarding both accounts, to the Bank under each withdrawal application and Financial&#13;
Monitoring Reports (FMRs).&#13;
The Ministry of Finance will prepare a Special Appropriations Warrant to request project funding for the&#13;
first year of implementation, and it is expected that subsequent project funding requirements will be&#13;
included in future government budget and planning estimates. The Government of Grenada will allocate&#13;
its counterpart funding (US$200,000 for 2002-03 and US$469,500 for 2003-04) into a local operational&#13;
project account.&#13;
31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The establishment of the new Special Account and the deposit of government's first year contribution in&#13;
the local operational account will be required prior to effectiveness.&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
Administrative procedures are in place to ensure that financial transactions are made with consideration to&#13;
safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry in the accounting/monitoring systems. The project&#13;
accounting system has the capacity to record assets, liabilities and financial transactions of the project,&#13;
and produce financial statements useful to project management and that meet IBRD's fiduciary&#13;
requirements. The accounting system is designed to be able to capture all financial information and&#13;
allocate among both categories (the Bank's legal/disbursement categories and GOG Budget categories)&#13;
and project activity.&#13;
The project will also submit detailed monthly statements of expenditures to the Office of the Accountant&#13;
General and to the MOFP in order that the project's expenditures are recorded on the Ministry's accounts&#13;
as well as supervised by the unit responsible for management of external financing.&#13;
Accounting. Accounting and budgetary records will be maintained in accordance with the GOG's&#13;
procedures, under the FAA Act and which are satisfactory to the Bank. However, for Bank monitoring&#13;
purposes the PCU will report on detailed information at the project level, specifically the deposits to the&#13;
special account and the expenditures classified by activity/ subcomponent and disbursement category.&#13;
The project has implemented a basic system that will be able to account for all financial transactions by&#13;
source of financing and by either general category or project activity detail.&#13;
Safeguard over assets. For the proposed project, the PCU will keep detailed subsidiary records of plant&#13;
and equipment acquired. The amounts in this register will be reconciled monthly against the respective&#13;
accounting balances. At least one annual physical inspection will be undertaken by MOFP/PCU staff,&#13;
preferably with the participation of staff from the external auditors and the Auditor General's Department.&#13;
External Audit&#13;
Audit arrangements. Annual project financial statements will be audited in accordance with&#13;
International Standards on Auditing, by an independent firm and in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
(TORs) both acceptable to the Bank. In addition to the audit opinions on project financial statements,&#13;
Special Accounts and FMRs, special purpose reports will be required to deal specifically with observance&#13;
of the procurement and consultants services provisions of the Loan Agreement. The memorandum on&#13;
internal controls ("management letter") will be issued annually.&#13;
The Terms of Reference for the independent annual audit has already been cleared and approved by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
The PCU will prepare, if needed, an action plan to address any issues and recommendations contained in&#13;
the audit reports. The action plan and follow-up activities would be communicated to the Bank.&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
Financial statements and reports will be prepared in formats satisfying the Government and IBRD's&#13;
monitoring and fiduciary purposes.&#13;
On a monthly basis (at least), the PCU will prepare the project's basic Statement of Expenditure, a matrix&#13;
classifying receipts by financing source and expenditures by financing source and disbursement (or&#13;
government expenditure) category. This report is submitted to the Office of the Accountant General and&#13;
to the MOFP.&#13;
In addition to Statement of Expenditure, the monthly financial reports will include the Special Account&#13;
Reconciliation Statements. Any difference in the amount of expenditures reported under the two financial&#13;
statements must be clearly explained. The project financial statements, along with the physical progress&#13;
and procurement sections of the FMRs, will be submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis, and will be&#13;
32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
submitted no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarter. The contents of the FMRs have&#13;
been discussed, and the formats of the reports will be finalized by loan negotiations.&#13;
The PCU will be responsible to liaise with the Directorate of Civil Aviation (the DCA, located in&#13;
Antigua) to consolidate the accounting and procurement information of the Training and Technical&#13;
Component, which will be implemented by the DCA. The PCU will receive each month a copy of the&#13;
Special Account reconciliation and a detailed monthly Statement of Expenditure. The PCU is also&#13;
responsible to include this information in the FMRs submitted to the Bank each quarter. The PCU will&#13;
maintain copies of all financial transactions and relevant documentation and the annual audit for the PCU&#13;
will cover this component implemented by the DCA.&#13;

EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Schedule 3.A&#13;
Economic Impact and Recovery Program&#13;
Impact on the tourism sector. Gross tourism earnings in St. Kitts and Nevis averaged around&#13;
40 percent of GDP in the second half of the 1990s, although hurricane damage later led to a reduction in&#13;
tourism and related earnings from which the country is still recovering. Dependence on tourism is thus&#13;
significant, particularly for the island of Nevis. The events of September 11 caused major setbacks in&#13;
several promotional efforts that the authorities were already undertaking to increase flights to St. Kitts in&#13;
the wake of a relatively lackluster market in early 2001. Delays meant that critical expansions of airlift,&#13;
which were to have been in place in time for the 2001/02 winter season, did not materialize as airlines&#13;
tried to adjust their operations to new realities.' The result was a fall in stayover arrivals at the start of the&#13;
winter season by almost 8 percent over previous trends, with the downturn in arrivals expected to be&#13;
prolonged through most of 2002.&#13;

With post-September 11 occupancies in some properties reported to be as low as 15 percent,&#13;
versus normal rates of 60 percent during the same period, hotels have had to cut their marketing budgets&#13;
significantly, despite a waiver of the 7 percent hotel tax (over fifteen months) granted by the Government&#13;
to help supplement the resources for the promotional activities.  Properties have responded with&#13;
widespread pay cuts and reductions in shift hours, rather than layoffs, although some persons (85 in total)&#13;
have been actually retrenched from the sector. In contrast, the cruise sub-sector, which was already&#13;
experiencing a boom in the early part of 2001 (with growth of 30 percent over 2000 due to a rebound after&#13;
earlier hurricane damage), has seen more vessel calls and faster growth in cruise visitors since September&#13;
I1, in part due to some diversion of cruise liners from other parts of the world. While this sector still&#13;
accounts for less than 10 percent of overall tourist expenditures in St. Kitts and Nevis, it is increasing&#13;
rapidly and is widely acknowledged to contribute to economic activity more broadly. The completion of&#13;
works at Port Zante is expected to clear the way for even more rapid growth in the cruise sector in the&#13;
future.&#13;
Overall impact. St. Kitts and Nevis is estimated to have had a marginal increase in overall&#13;
tourism earnings to approximately EC$157 million during 2001, in comparison to the EC$167 million&#13;
counterfactual projection for the year. For 2002, however, it is projected that the combination of a slow&#13;
lIn particular, a new service out of Philadelphia was delayed until November 2002; another from Detroit until end January 2002,&#13;
missing the critical winter holiday season; one from Montreal that just recently began was withdrawn until late 2002; and&#13;
negotiations for a direct service from Manchester aimed at increasing the UK market intake has been put on hold. In addition,&#13;
American Eagle reduced the number of daily flights from San Juan from four to two during the last quarter of 2001, and started&#13;
using smaller aircrafl on the route.&#13;
37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recovery in stayover arrivals in 2002,2 significant discounting of room rates (on average 20 percent), and&#13;
an expected leveling off of cruise visitors, will result in even lower earnings. These shortfalls in earnings&#13;
have impacted the economy in general, and exacerbated a particularly difficult fiscal situation. Real GDP&#13;
is estimated to have continued growing (at around 2 percent) in 2001, although slower than estimated in&#13;
the counterfactual scenario (2.8 percent). However the economy is projected to contract by around&#13;
2 percent in 2002 (compared with less than one percentage point in the counterfactual scenario), in part&#13;
due to the direct effect of September 11 on tourism activity and also to the further fiscal adjustments that&#13;
this has necessitated, over and above the Government's continuing program of recovery from Hurricanes&#13;
Georges (1998) and Lenny (1999). It is also projected that (relative to the counterfactual) the external&#13;
current account balance will deteriorate further in 2002 by around EC$18 million, or about 2 percent of&#13;
GDP.&#13;

Fiscal measures. As part of its fiscal adjustment, the Government cancelled the 2001 annual&#13;
salary bonus to civil servants and has instituted a freeze on hiring, as well as tighter controls over official&#13;
travel. The authorities are also considering a number of additional measures. At the same time, the&#13;
Government is strongly committed to diversifying away from sugar operations (which currently absorb&#13;
around 3 percent of GDP in subsidies). The coming on-stream of several large private sector operations,&#13;
including a 600-room hotel that is due to open in late 2002, is expected to create significant employment&#13;
opportunities, thus mitigating the impact of reduced employment opportunities in the sugar sector.&#13;
Maintaining social programs. Although outright layoffs in the tourism sector have been fewer&#13;
than expected, the Government is still concerned that the widespread reduction in shift hours which has&#13;
reduced some employees' take-home pay by as much as 40 percent and which, combined with lower&#13;
earnings by independent operators such as taxi drivers and beauticians, will raise the number of&#13;
households who rely on social assistance. A recent Poverty Assessment, completed with assistance from&#13;
CDB, reports poverty headcount rates of around 30 percent for both Nevis and St. Kitts. While the&#13;
continued fiscal adjustment in St. Kitts and Nevis is constraining further increases in expenditures on&#13;
social protection during the recovery period, the Government is committed to maintaining its safety net&#13;
program which caters to the elderly, indigent and children in foster care through in-kind food grants and&#13;
financial assistance for medical expenses, housing, and education. In addition, the Government is&#13;
undertaking the formulation of a National Poverty Eradication Strategy to follow up on the findings of the&#13;
Poverty Assessment.&#13;
Tourism promotion and relief efforts. As a strategy toward recovery, the Tourism Authority&#13;
has proposed to increase its promotional activities by approximately EC$600,000 (or just under 20&#13;
percent of the Authority's 2001 marketing budget), mainly targeted toward securing the additional airlift&#13;
2Including the planned opening of a new hotel in the Fall, which will bring on-stream at least 600 new rooms.&#13;
38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
that has been delayed. This would supplement the normal promotional work out of its overseas offices in&#13;
London, New York and Toronto. The Authority is currently discussing with hotels and other ancillary&#13;
businesses who benefit directly or indirectly from tourism the possibility of their co-financing&#13;
approximately one-third of the additional promotional work. St. Kitts and Nevis will also participate in&#13;
the Regional Tourism Emergency Program, with the Government's share of US$197,500 financed&#13;
through a concessional loan from CDB. Regarding the cruise sector, which has benefited significantly&#13;
from increased calls from vessels that have been diverted from the European market, the authorities will&#13;
continue their recently enhanced promotional efforts.&#13;
The outlook for the 2002 will depend heavily on revitalized commitments with respect to airlift.&#13;
Barring further incidents, the second half of the year should show improved performance both as the U.S.&#13;
market picks up, and as USAir and Air 2000 services are introduced. Discussions are also underway with&#13;
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic with a view to providing direct routes from Europe. Moreover, the&#13;
new Royal St. Kitts Marriott hotel which is scheduled to open in the fall, will expand the plant capacity&#13;
by at least 600 rooms and will also provide incremental tourism marketing as the hotel undertakes&#13;
promotion to fill the rooms. In preparation for such a large addition, the authorities have recognized the&#13;
need to foster an expansion of training programs and to build on the program of community awareness&#13;
currently run by the Hotel and Tourism Association. The Association will try to expand its CIDA-&#13;
supported middle management capacity building initiative, where staff are sent on attachments to hotels&#13;
in Jamaica and the Bahamas, as well as to replicate an IDB-financed training program currently in place&#13;
in Trinidad and Tobago.&#13;
Strengthening oversight of the offshore sector. Nevis is a major offshore center with over&#13;
23,000 international business companies (IBCs), 5000 trusts and one bank registered, while the sector in&#13;
St. Kitts is much smaller - only 500 IBCs and 3 trusts. Since mid-2000, when both islands were listed by&#13;
the FATF as weak jurisdictions regarding supervision of offshore financial institutions and anti-money-&#13;
laundering safeguards, the Government has taken a number of steps to correct the situation. The Financial&#13;
Services Commission and Financial Intelligence Unit, which were established in May 2001 on the basis&#13;
of legislation in late 2000, are both fully staffed and operational. Under the new set up, there is one&#13;
commission with separate regulators for both territories. In addition, a new Proceeds of Crime Act was&#13;
enacted in November 2000 replacing the earlier 1993 law, which broadened the definition of money&#13;
laundering as a crime, and created stricter requirements for the reporting of suspicious transactions. To&#13;
follow up, anti-money laundering regulations were issued in May 2001, and the Federation has completed&#13;
Module 1 of the IMF-assisted self-assessment of the offshore sector regulatory and supervisory practices.&#13;
Nevis has invited ECCB to become jointly involved with the national regulator in supervising the off-&#13;
shore financial sector. As a result of these actions, St. Kitts and Nevis has been invited to submit an&#13;
implementation plan to the FATF, the next stage toward removal from the list.&#13;

Emergency Recovery Project&#13;
Schedule 3.B&#13;
Project Components, Estimated Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
1.1 Project components&#13;
1.1.1  Component 1: Critical Import (US$1,500,000)&#13;
This component will finance one critical import, namely low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity&#13;
generation, which is critical to maintaining economic activity in the tourism industry by ensuring that the&#13;
energy-intensive tourism facilities are kept operational during the recovery period. The inclusion of this&#13;
sole import is based on an assessment of St. Kitts and Nevis's monthly import bill and review of&#13;
satisfactory procurement practices.&#13;
1.1.2  Component 2: Security Enhancement at ports and airports (US$3,060,000)&#13;
The cost estimates include design and supervision (US$20,000).&#13;
1.1.2.1 Physical Improvement of infrastructure&#13;
* Robert L. Bradshaw International and Newcastle International Airports and Basseterre and&#13;
Charlestown Ports Perimeter Fencing and Road Grading (US$930,000)&#13;
As the existing fencing along the perimeter of Bradshaw Hall International Airport is damaged and&#13;
not in compliance with ICAO standards, it will need to be replaced almost in its entirety. At Newcastle&#13;
Airport, there is also a need to replace and/or complement fencing.&#13;
In addition, at Bradshaw airport, grading will need to be performed to permit tractor mowing on both&#13;
sides of the new fence, as the present fence is overgrown with vegetation, and is constructed on steeply&#13;
sloped hillsides.&#13;
At Basseterre and Charlestown Ports, erection and/or repairs of the port fencing will be undertaken.&#13;
This cost estimate includes the provision of design and supervision.&#13;
* Construction of a Guard House at Bradshaw International Airport (US$30,000)&#13;
The second improvement that will be undertaken at Bradshaw International Airport is the&#13;
construction of a new guard house/gate house that overlooks both the cargo storage area and the primary&#13;
gate providing access to the air operation area. The new gate will be constructed with an electronic lock&#13;
and opening mechanism that can be activated by the guards without having to leave their post.&#13;
This cost estimate includes the provision of design and supervision.&#13;
1.1.2.2 Security Equipment&#13;
* ID Badging and Tracking System (US$365,000)&#13;
At Bradshaw International Airport, there is a need to provide both an electronic ID badging/tracking&#13;
system and a Watch List PAX tracking system.&#13;
* Checked Baggage Screening Systems at Bradshaw and Newcastle International Airports and&#13;
Basseterre and Charlestown Ports (US$634,000)&#13;
Bradshaw presently has no operational checked-baggage screening systems. As 100 percent screening&#13;
of checked baggage is likely to become an ICAO requirement, two dual scanners for checked bags will be&#13;
purchased under the project. In addition, one sniffer will be acquired for Bradshaw.&#13;
On the other hand, at Bradshaw and Newcastle International Airports and Basseterre and Charlestown&#13;
Ports, there are no hand baggage screening systems. The project will finance six sets of hand baggage&#13;
40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
screening systems, consisting of X-ray scanners, WTM, and UPS. Also, on the Ferry Terminal, one set of&#13;
baggage scanner will be acquired.&#13;
* Airport and Port Security Patrol Vehicle (US$64,000)&#13;
Two four-wheel drive Sport Utility Vehicles (SWV) will be financed by the project, allowing patrol of&#13;
terminal exterior, parking lots, airport operating area, and perimeter fencing for Bradshaw International&#13;
and Newcastle Airports. These vehicles will enable patrols along improved roadways near the airports&#13;
perimeter fencing. They will also be equipped with light bars (per ICAO Standards for airport vehicles)&#13;
and communications equipment.&#13;
*  Port Patrol Vessel (US$270,000)&#13;
Considering that the Basseterre and Charlestown ports need the ability to conduct regular and&#13;
thorough patrols of both docking areas and the overall harbor area to deter and detect any unlawful&#13;
activity, the project will finance two small port patrol boats (one for each port) capable of all-weather&#13;
operations, to be staffed by each port's security personnel.&#13;
* Communications Equipment at the Airports and the Ports (US$47,000)&#13;
Presently, very few of the security guards at both of the airports have hand-held radios to&#13;
communicate with each other or with other critical units, such as air traffic control, Crash Fire Rescue&#13;
(CFR) crews, or police units.&#13;
All together, thirty-five (35) hand-held units, along with four base units, five vehicle-mounted units&#13;
and one marine unit will be purchased for the airports and the ports. The costs of extra batteries and&#13;
battery charging units have been factored in to the above estimates.&#13;
* Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) System (US$445,000)&#13;
Two standard CCTV systems will be purchased for Bradshaw Airport and Port Zante, and one larger&#13;
system will be purchased for the Main Berth at the cruise terminal. Each system will include cameras,&#13;
multiplexers, monitors and VCRs to provide adequate coverage in areas where continual guard presence&#13;
is not possible.&#13;
This cost estimate includes the provision of design and supervision (US$20,000).&#13;
1.1.2.3 Institutional Capacity Building (US$305,000 per country)&#13;
This regional component is financed and implemented on an equal share basis among all participating&#13;
countries (US$305,000 per country) and includes the provision of Executive Training (US$15,000),&#13;
Security Operations Training (US$100,000), Specialized Training (US$80,000), Technical Assistance for&#13;
Regulatory Review for Enhanced Security (US$95,000), and Short-term Procurement Services&#13;
(US$15,000). The detailed description of each element of the regional training component is given in&#13;
Schedule 1.B.&#13;
1.1.3 Component 3: Project Management (US$330,000)&#13;
This component is aimed at assisting Government in meeting its project management obligations&#13;
through the strengthening of the existing Project Coordination Unit. The project will finance the services&#13;
of one full-time qualified accountant for forty months and an administrative assistant for thirty-six&#13;
months. In addition, it will finance training, office equipment, operating expenditures and financial&#13;
audits.&#13;
1.2  Estimated costs&#13;
The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$5,200,000. Detailed cost&#13;
estimates are given in Table 3.B. 1.&#13;
41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.3 Financing plan&#13;
Out of a total cost of US$5,200,000, the Bank will finance US$4,400,000 (85 percent of the total&#13;
project cost) under an IBRD loan and the balance (US$800,000) will be financed by the Government.&#13;

Emergency Recovery Project&#13;
Schedule 3.C&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Project Coordination and Management&#13;
Project Coordination will be the responsibility of Project Coordination Unit (PCU), established&#13;
under the Ministry of Finance for the Implementation of the Emergency Recovery and Disaster&#13;
Management Project. The PCU will be responsible for managing the different aspects of the project,&#13;
coordinating implementing agencies, keeping accounts, and reporting to the Bank. The PCU presently&#13;
includes a project coordinator, a procurement officer and a part-time accountant. Financing will be&#13;
provided under the project to cover the cost of one full-time accountant and one administrative assistant.&#13;
Recruitment of full-time qualified accountant will be a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
The Civil Works and Equipment elements of the Security Enhancement Component will be&#13;
implemented by the Saint Kitts and Nevis Airport and Sea Port Authorities. To this end, these agencies&#13;
will designate a contact person who will work closely under the auspices and the supervision of the PCU&#13;
and will provide progress reports to the PCU on a semi-annual basis. The PCU will handle the&#13;
procurement and contract management responsibilities for these components on behalf of the Saint Kitts&#13;
and Nevis Airport and Sea Port Authorities.&#13;
While training in the use of security equipment financed under the project will be included in&#13;
each contract and provided by suppliers, specialized training and technical assistance in security&#13;
management, safety, contingency planning, and crisis management, will be carried out through the OECS&#13;
Civil Aviation Directorate under a separate regional agreement. The OECS Civil Aviation Directorate&#13;
will ensure the development and implementation of training and technical assistance activities on a&#13;
regional basis.&#13;
The Critical Import component will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. All&#13;
supporting documentation required for disbursements will be assembled by the PCU with the assistance&#13;
of the Customs Department. The PCU will prepare a consolidated quarterly progress report on all project&#13;
activities and submit it to the Bank.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
The civil works under this project consist of: (i) the installation of new fencings at Bradshaw and&#13;
Newcastle International Airports and the Basseterre and Charlestown Ports; (ii) the construction of a&#13;
guard house at Bradshaw Airport; and (iii) the grading of the perimeter of Bradshaw Airport. Given the&#13;
nature and expected size of the works, National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be used with the&#13;
possibility for foreign firms to participate. Advertisement for these works will be made through the&#13;
announcement of the project in the General Procurement Notice and an announcement in a local&#13;
newspaper of wide distribution. The total estimated costs of these works are expected to range from&#13;
US$30,000 to US$820,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$930,000. Small works estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$100,000 individually would be procured using three quotations obtained from qualified&#13;
contractors.&#13;
Goods and Eguinment&#13;
Equipment under the project consists of: (i) ID badging/tracking system at Bradshaw Airport; (ii)&#13;
baggage screening systems including walk-through metal detectors, uninterrupted power system units,&#13;
handheld metal detectors and sniffers; (iii) close-circuit television systems; (iv) airport security patrol&#13;
vehicles and seaport patrol boats; and (v) small communication system equipment such as hand-held&#13;
radios, base units radios and vehicle-mounted units. The procurement of the primary equipment i.e.,&#13;
items (i), (ii) and (iii) above with estimated aggregate costs of US$365,000, US$634,000, and&#13;
45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
US$425,000 respectively will be carried out through ICB procedures. All equipment contracts will&#13;
include installation or supervision of installation, training on the equipment operation and maintenance, as&#13;
appropriate. International and/or national shopping procedures would be used for the procurement of the&#13;
communication and small equipment estimated to cost up to an aggregate amount of US$126,000. The&#13;
procurement of the patrol boats estimated at a cost of US$135,000 each will be made through limited&#13;
international bidding.&#13;
Critical Import&#13;
The main critical import will consist of low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation estimated&#13;
to cost US$1,500,000 and will be procured following established commercial practices found acceptable&#13;
by the Bank and for which disbursement would be made on the basis of agreed import documentation.&#13;
Consultant Services&#13;
Consultants' services consist of: (i) engineering design and supervision for the civil works&#13;
components (buildings, roadways, and fences, etc.); (ii) the hiring of consulting firms or individuals for&#13;
the design and implementation of the security training program; (iii) technical assistance; (iv) additional&#13;
staff for the PCU; and (v) auditors for the project accounts. The hiring of firms will be made using&#13;
Quality and Cost-based Selection (QCBS) and the hiring of individuals will be made using selection&#13;
based on qualifications.&#13;
Prior Review&#13;
All ICB will require prior review by the Bank. Two copies of the signed contracts should be sent&#13;
to the Bank prior to requesting disbursements against these contracts. The first two NCB procurements&#13;
for civil works, the first two procurements of smaller works and the first procurement of goods under&#13;
local or international shopping will require prior review. All consultants' services estimated to cost above&#13;
US$50,000 will be subject to prior review and all services estimated to cost less than US$50,000 will&#13;
require the prior review of the TORs, contract and CVs.&#13;

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Implementing Entities&#13;
The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) currently implements the Emergency Recovery and&#13;
Disaster Management project with an established Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and will be the&#13;
implementing entity to coordinate all activities under this project. Regarding the financial management&#13;
arrangements, the PCU had appointed a part-time accountant (who has worked with the current Disaster&#13;
Management project) to oversee all aspects of financial management for the project, however this&#13;
arrangement has not been successful. The PCU is currently in the process of recruiting a full-time&#13;
qualified accountant to oversee both the existing Disaster Management project as well as the new&#13;
Emergency Operations. The recruitment of the accountant will be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
This staff member will also liaise with the Office of the Accountant General and Customs Department for&#13;
matters of consolidation of documentation for critical imports and accounting information, and for&#13;
monitoring the flow of funds to the project.&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
Procedures for flow of funds from the loan and the required counterpart contribution will be implemented&#13;
with due regard to safeguarding project's resources and ensuring timely execution of payments.&#13;
Loan funds will be disbursed to one Special Account (US dollar account for Bank funds), and this account&#13;
will be utilized for the purposes of the implementation arrangements agreed upon. The Bank has required&#13;
that the Special Account be opened (by the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP)) and maintained in&#13;
a commercial bank, due to the difficulties the PCU has experienced under the Disaster Management&#13;
project when the account was held in the Central Bank. The management of this account will be the&#13;
responsibility of the PCU. The PCU will transfer funds from the Special Account to the project account,&#13;
from which checks or transfers (in local currency) will be issued to the providers of goods and services.&#13;
The project will reconcile (monthly) both the project account as well as the Special Account, and submit&#13;
the documentation regarding both accounts, to the Bank under each withdrawal application and&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). As the PCU has not been able to regularly produce complete Project&#13;
Management Reports, it has been agreed that the project will disburse solely on the basis of SOEs.&#13;
The Ministry of Finance will prepare a Special Appropriations Warrant to request project funding for the&#13;
first year of implementation, and it is expected that subsequent project funding requirements will be&#13;
included in future government budget and planning estimates. The Government of St. Kitts and Nevis&#13;
47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
will allocate its counterpart funding (US$369,500 for 2002-03 and US$400,000 for 2003-04) into a local&#13;
operational project account.&#13;
The establishment of the new Special Account and the deposit of government's first year contribution in&#13;
the local operational account will also be required prior to effectiveness.&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
Administrative procedures are in place to ensure that financial transactions are made with consideration to&#13;
safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry in the accounting/monitoring systems. The project&#13;
accounting system has the capacity to record assets, liabilities and financial transactions of the project,&#13;
and produce financial statements useful to project management and that meet IBRD's fiduciary&#13;
requirements. The accounting system is designed to be able to capture all financial information and&#13;
allocate among both categories (the Bank's legal/disbursement categories and GOSKN Budget&#13;
categories) and project activity.&#13;
Accounting. Accounting and budgetary records will be maintained in accordance with the GOSKN's&#13;
procedures, under the FAA Act and which are satisfactory to the Bank. However, for Bank monitoring&#13;
purposes the PCU will report on detailed information at the project level, specifically the deposits to the&#13;
special account and the expenditures classified by activity/subcomponent and disbursement category.&#13;
The project had implemented a basic system that will be able to account for all financial transactions by&#13;
source of financing and by either general category or project activity detail. The system will be updated&#13;
and further customized to meet the demands of the new project once the new accountant is appointed.&#13;
Safeguard over assets. For the proposed project, the PCU will keep detailed subsidiary records of plant&#13;
and equipment acquired. The amounts in this register will be reconciled monthly against the respective&#13;
accounting balances. At least one annual physical inspection will be undertaken by MOFP/PCU staff,&#13;
preferably with the participation of staff from the external auditors.&#13;
External Audit&#13;
Audit arrangements. Annual project financial statements will be audited in accordance with&#13;
International Standards on Auditing, by an independent firm and in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
(TORs) both acceptable to the Bank. In addition to the audit opinions on project financial statements,&#13;
Special Accounts and SOEs, special purpose reports will be required to deal specifically with observance&#13;
of the procurement and consultants services provisions of the Loan Agreement. The memorandum on&#13;
internal controls ("management letter") will be issued annually.&#13;
The Terms of Reference for the independent annual audit has already been cleared and approved by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
The PCU will prepare, if needed, an action plan to address any issues and recommendations contained in&#13;
the audit reports. The action plan and follow-up activities would be communicated to the Bank.&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
Financial statements and reports will be prepared in formats satisfying the Government and IBRD's&#13;
monitoring and fiduciary purposes.&#13;
On a monthly basis (at least), the PCU will prepare the project's basic Statement of Expenditure, a matrix&#13;
classifying receipts by financing source and expenditures by financing source and disbursement (or&#13;
government expenditure) category. This report is submitted to the Office of the Accountant General and&#13;
to the MOFP.&#13;
In addition to Statement of Expenditure, the monthly financial reports will include the Special Account&#13;
Reconciliation Statements. Any difference in the amount of expenditures reported under the two financial&#13;
statements must be clearly explained. The project financial statements, along with the physical progress&#13;
and procurement sections of the FMRs, will be submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis, and will be&#13;
48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
submitted no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarter. The contents of the FMRs have&#13;
been discussed, and the formats of the reports will be finalized by loan negotiations.&#13;
The PCU will be responsible to liaise with the Directorate of Civil Aviation (the DCA, located in&#13;
Antigua) to consolidate the accounting and procurement information of the Training and Technical&#13;
Component, which will be implemented by the DCA. The PCU will receive each month a copy of the&#13;
Special Account reconciliation and a detailed monthly Statement of Expenditure. The PCU is also&#13;
responsible to include this information in the FMRs submitted to the Bank each quarter. The PCU will&#13;
maintain copies of all financial transactions and relevant documentation and the annual audit for the PCU&#13;
will cover this component implemented by the DCA.&#13;

EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Schedule 4.A&#13;
Economic Impact and Recovery Program&#13;
Impact on the tourism sector. With gross tourism earnings amounting to some 40 percent of&#13;
GDP, St. Lucia's dependency on tourism is greater than in most other OECS countries. Following strong&#13;
growth in visitor traffic in the year 2000, the period January through August 2001 had been sluggish, with&#13;
stay-over arrivals (from which the country generates the bulk of tourist income) contracting by 1.8&#13;
percent relative to the same period in 2000 despite reported modest price discounting over and above&#13;
usual seasonal levels. The period after September 11, 2001 witnessed a sharp fall relative to the same&#13;
months in 2000, especially in stay-over arrivals. Together with deeper discounts, the reduced flow of&#13;
arrivals is estimated to have resulted in a loss of approximately EC$97 million (US$36 million) in&#13;
tourism earnings for 2001 as a whole compared with a counterfactual scenario where trends over the&#13;
period January through August would have extended to the last four months of the year.&#13;

The current projections for 2002 are for a gradual recovery in stay-over arrivals over the year,&#13;
such that by year-end arrivals would have returned to trend levels. Cruise visitor arrivals, in contrast, are&#13;
expected to make a full recovery from the start of the calendar year, although the earnings from this&#13;
category of visitor are very small compared with income generated from stay-over visitors. Price&#13;
discounting at the levels reported in late 2001 is projected to be sustained through 2002. Altogether,&#13;
tourism earnings for 2002 are projected to be about EC$93 million lower than they would have been in a&#13;
counterfactual scenario allowing for modest growth during the year.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Overall impact. The drop-off in arrivals and earnings following September 11 is having a&#13;
significant impact on the tourism sector and the broader economy. While only one property closure has&#13;
been reported and large-scale layoffs have thus far been avoided, sharply decreased occupancy rates&#13;
(reportedly 20-30 percent below normal) have resulted in reduced work shift hours and hampered new job&#13;
creation in the sector. Real GDP in 2001 is estimated to have contracted by 3.7 percent, as the slowdown&#13;
in tourism compounded the effects of drought on banana production, as well as of continuing weakness in&#13;
manufacturing and construction. It is estimated that in the absence of the September 11 fallout on&#13;
tourism, the contraction in real GDP would have been limited to around 1.8 percent in 2001. For 2002,&#13;
real GDP growth is projected at 1.6 percent as the tourism sector recovers, although output would remain&#13;
significantly below the level it would have attained in a counterfactual scenario. The fallout from&#13;
September 11 is also putting additional pressure on the balance of payments, with the corresponding&#13;
deterioration in the current account balance estimated at EC$68.6 million (about 3.5 percent of GDP) in&#13;
2001 and projected at EC$65.3 million (3.3 percent of GDP) in 2002. In the fiscal accounts, the&#13;
combination of revenue losses and additional expenditure needs as a result of the fallout from September&#13;
11 amounts to an estimated EC$7.8 million (US$2.9 million) in 2001 and a projected EC$27.8 million&#13;
(US$10.3 million) in 2002.&#13;
Tourism relief and promotional efforts. In an effort to increase arrivals, St. Lucia increased its&#13;
annual budget for tourist promotion by 37 percent after September 11, to support further work with UK&#13;
and US tour operators, and to strengthen and expand the 2002 summer promotions. These efforts are&#13;
expected to complement earlier plans by USAir and Virgin Atlantic to add a combined three weekly&#13;
flights from the US and the UK. In addition, the Government has introduced a special relief package for&#13;
hotels involving a sector-wide waiver of duties and applicable taxes on dairy, meat products and other&#13;
foods stuffs, cleaning and kitchen equipment and supplies, and materials for retrofitting and refurbishing.&#13;
It has also waived the usual 8 percent food and beverage tax for consumption associated with groups and&#13;
conferences, and incentive travel. The Government has also assisted the hotel sector in negotiating&#13;
discounts on equipment from the electricity company, to complement general corporate discounts that the&#13;
company had instituted earlier in the year. In addition, St. Lucia has revised its yachting policies to&#13;
eliminate duplication in registration and charges at the various ports of entry. The sub-sector is expected&#13;
to grow by around 40 percent during 2002, although still only representing a minute fraction of overall&#13;
tourism earnings.&#13;
As a longer-term measure, the Government has reconvened the dormant Tourism Advisory&#13;
Council made up of cabinet ministers and sector stakeholders to begin the formulation of a National&#13;
Tourism Policy. The policy would support a strategy to develop St. Lucia as an up-market destination&#13;
through quality, rather than price, competition and would address issues related to: (a) investment and&#13;
facilitation; (b) product development; (c) quality standards, in particular those that would qualify&#13;
investors for incentives under the new marketing thrust; (d) visitor safety; (e) economic linkages -&#13;
shifting from the historical "buy local" campaigns toward using the tourism sector as a platform for&#13;
international exports; and (f) community participation, including an expansion of the recently successful&#13;
heritage tour concept.&#13;
Social programs. In response to weakness in the economy, but also mindful of growing fiscal&#13;
weakness, the Government has tried to accelerate the public investment program, in particular those&#13;
projects with substantial employment requirements. In this vein, the Government has introduced a&#13;
Special Program of Works with a supplemental budget of EC$6 million, and extended an earlier Special&#13;
Employment Program. A new ministry of Social Mobilization has been established inter alia to&#13;
strengthen safety nets, in part with the new tranche of the European Union Special Framework of&#13;
Assistance.&#13;
Strengthening oversight of the offshore sector. St. Lucia only recently established an offshore&#13;
sector with legislation in 1998 and the commencement of registration in 1999. As a result, the sector is&#13;
very small, comprising only 354 international business companies (IBCs), one bank, eight trusts and eight&#13;
international insurance companies. In part because of relatively up-to-date legislation, St. Lucia has not&#13;
been listed by the FATF. However, in light of the greater need for vigilance in the oversight of the&#13;
54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
offshore sector following the September 11 events, in January 2002 the government moved the&#13;
administration and supervision of the sector to the Ministry of Finance, and has established a Cabinet&#13;
subcommittee to undertake a comprehensive review. St. Lucia already involves the ECCB in a joint&#13;
review of new applications.  The authorities have also recently completed the IMF-assisted self&#13;
assessment of offshore finance regulations and supervision, and will benefit from OECD technical&#13;
assistance in setting up a financial intelligence unit. Marketing and processing of applications are&#13;
contracted to a private sector firm, in line with international norms. Although the sector has seen some&#13;
falloff of registrations and associated revenues since September 11, authorities expect applications to&#13;
rebound during 2002.&#13;

ST. LUCIA&#13;
Emergency Recovery Project&#13;
Schedule 4.B&#13;
Project Components, Estimated Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
1.1 Project components&#13;
1.1.1  Component 1: Critical Import (US$2,400,000)&#13;
This component will finance one critical import, low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation,&#13;
which is critical to maintain economic activity in the tourism industry by ensuring that the energy-&#13;
intensive tourism facilities are kept operational during the recovery period. The inclusion of this sole&#13;
import is based on an assessment of St. Lucia's monthly import bill and review of satisfactory&#13;
procurement practices.&#13;
1.1.2  Component 2: Security Enhancement at ports and airports (US$4,314,500)&#13;
The cost estimates include design and supervision (US$110,000).&#13;
1.1.2.1 Physical Improvement of infrastructure&#13;
* George F.L. Charles Airport Fencing and Apron Security Barricade (US$155,000)&#13;
Because portions of the west end perimeter fencing are damaged, missing, or incomplete, it is&#13;
essential that an effort be made to provide ICAO-compliant perimeter fencing in that area. Although the&#13;
terrain is difficult and provides some natural barriers to entry onto the runway and operations areas, some&#13;
replacement fencing is also needed to provide basic deterrence. Approximately 1,750 ft of perimeter&#13;
fencing will be erected at the western end of the airfield.&#13;
In addition, and in order to improve the visual and physical separation between persons outside and&#13;
inside the perimeter fencing near the terminal Apron boarding area, the construction of a high cement&#13;
block wall will be necessary.&#13;
This cost estimate includes the provision of design and supervision (US$5,000).&#13;
*  Construction of Baggage Screening Facility at George F.L. Charles Airport (US$275,000)&#13;
The second major capital improvement that will be undertaken at George F.L. Charles airport is the&#13;
construction of an addition to the existing terminal or a new freestanding facility to house screening&#13;
equipment for checked baggage. Physical constraints at the current terminal preclude the accommodation&#13;
of screening devices for checked baggage. As ICAO moves toward 100 percent screening of checked&#13;
bags, the airport will need to house the required machinery and personnel to accomplish this task.&#13;
This cost estimate includes the provision of design and supervision (US$25,000).&#13;
* Perimeter Roadway Construction at Hewanorra Airport (US$790,000)&#13;
Because patrol of the perimeter of some sections of the Hewanorra airfield is difficult, if not&#13;
impossible, it is important that a roadway be constructed to permit vehicle patrol.&#13;
This cost estimate includes the provision of design and supervision (US$40,000).&#13;
1.1.2.2 Security Equipment&#13;
* Passenger Tracking and Watch List System (US$240,000)&#13;
The Government does not presently possess the capability to track persons entering the country or to&#13;
monitor watch lists generated by airlines, other governments or organizations such as Interpol. A&#13;
specialized system will be financed under the project.&#13;
56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* Checked Baggage Screening Systems at the Airports (US$465,000)&#13;
George F.L. Charles airport presently has no operational checked-baggage screening systems. As 100&#13;
percent screening of checked baggage is likely to become an ICAO requirement, two new screening units&#13;
(along with UPS units and belts) will be purchased for use in the annex or addition to be constructed, as&#13;
discussed above.&#13;
Similarly, Hewanorra airport presently has only one operational checked-baggage screening system,&#13;
owned and operated by Virgin Atlantic Airways, which is not available for general use. Three new&#13;
screening units and the associated beltway system will therefore be purchased.&#13;
* ID Badging and Tracking System (US$125,000)&#13;
The Saint Lucia Airport and Sea Port Authority (SLASPA) presently issue identification (ID)&#13;
credentials manually, and maintain the airports and ports IDs in a physical file. This makes tracking and&#13;
cancellation of issued IDs difficult and time-consuming. It has also resulted in a system where persons&#13;
who should no longer possess access to port and airport facilities still maintain authorized IDs.&#13;
The project will finance the acquisition of a system that will automate the issuance, tracking, and&#13;
cancellation of IDs for personnel.&#13;
* Passenger and Hand Baggage Screening Systems for the Airports and the Pointe Seraphine Port&#13;
(US$343,000)&#13;
George F.L. Charles airport presently has one operational walk-through magnetometer (WTM) and&#13;
one operational X-ray screening machine for passengers' carry-on baggage. The terminal is presently&#13;
undergoing construction of an expanded passenger waiting area that will permit use of dual screening&#13;
systems. The existing operational unit will be retained for use as a backup or for screening of VIP or&#13;
charter passengers, as required.&#13;
Two complete scanning stations (each station consisting of a baggage x-ray scanner, a WTM, and an&#13;
uninterruptible power system (UPS)) will be acquired. In addition, ten (10) handheld metal detectors&#13;
("wands") will be acquired for use as secondary portable screening devices.&#13;
Hewanorra airport presently has two operational walk-through magnetometers (WTM) and two&#13;
operational X-ray screening machine for passengers' carry-on baggage. Both are more than five years old&#13;
and should be replaced with newer, more sensitive units. Two complete scanning stations (each station&#13;
consisting of a baggage X-ray scanner, a WTM, and an uninterruptible power system (UPS)) will&#13;
therefore be acquired. Ten (10) handheld metal detectors ("wands") will also be acquired for use as&#13;
secondary portable screening devices.&#13;
In addition, because of the level of in-transit passengers at Hewanorra, a new in-transit screening&#13;
station will be acquired. This will consist of the same equipment as the Passenger and Hand Baggage&#13;
Screening System above, but would be solely dedicated to in-transit passengers and their carry-on&#13;
baggage. This system will cost US$67,000.&#13;
Lastly, Pointe Seraphine Port security has a need to conduct body searches of suspicious persons in&#13;
the vicinity of the Pointe Seraphine and Main Dock terminals. Ten (10) hand-held metal detectors will be&#13;
purchased to assist port security in locating weapons or other dangerous articles.&#13;
* Airport Security Patrol Vehicle (US$64,000)&#13;
Two four-wheel drive sport utility vehicles (SUV) will be financed by the project, allowing patrol of&#13;
terminal exterior, parking lots, airport operating area, and perimeter fencing for the two airports. These&#13;
vehicles will enable patrols along improved roadways near the airports perimeter fencing. They will also&#13;
be equipped with light bars (per ICAO Standards for airport vehicles) and communications equipment.&#13;
* Port Patrol Vessel (US$135,000)&#13;
In view of the high level of cruise ship travel into the Pointe Seraphine and Main Dock terminals,&#13;
there is inadequate surveillance of commercial and private vessels near cruise ships that are docked at the&#13;
57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
port. The port needs the ability to conduct regular and thorough patrols of both docking areas and the&#13;
overall harbor area to deter and detect any unlawful activity.&#13;
The project will finance a small port patrol boat capable of all-weather operations, to be staffed by&#13;
port security.&#13;
* Sniffers (US$260,000)&#13;
As no system is presently available for detecting the presence of chemicals and explosives,&#13;
neither at the airports nor at the ports, four electronic "sniffers" for chemical and explosive detection&#13;
will be financed. This estimate includes the housing of the equipment, and air-conditioning as&#13;
appropriate.&#13;
*  Communications Equipment at the Airports and Pointe Seraphine Port (US$45,000)&#13;
Presently, very few of the security guards at both of the airports have hand-held radios to&#13;
communicate with each other or with other critical units, such as air traffic control, crash fire rescue&#13;
(CFR) crews, or police units.&#13;
Five (5) hand-held units will be purchased for George F.L. Charles Airport ($1000 per unit or&#13;
$5,000), along with one base unit ($2,000) and one vehicle-mounted unit ($1,000). The costs of extra&#13;
batteries and battery charging units have been factored in to the above estimates.&#13;
Similarly, twelve (12) hand-held units will be purchased for Hewanorra Airport ($1000 per unit or&#13;
$12,000), along with one base unit ($2,000) and one vehicle-mounted unit ($ 1,000).&#13;
Lastly, approximately twenty (20) hand-held units be purchased for use at Pointe Seraphine seaport&#13;
($1000 per unit or $20,000), along with two patrol vessel-mounted units ($2,000). Existing base units at&#13;
the port offices are adequate.&#13;
* Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) System (US$1,090,000)&#13;
George F.L. Charles airport presently has a CCTV system in operation at the airport, though some&#13;
cameras are inoperative and there are some "blind" spots where camera coverage is not available.&#13;
Approximately twenty (20) additional cameras, multiplexer, 5 monitors and 2 VCRs will be to provide&#13;
more complete coverage in areas where continual guard presence is not possible.&#13;
Similarly, Hewanorra airport presently has an insufficient CCTV system in operation at the airport.&#13;
Approximately twenty-five (25) additional cameras, multiplexer, 4 monitors and 2 VCRs will be acquired&#13;
to provide more complete coverage in areas where continual guard presence is not possible.&#13;
The Pointe Seraphine Seaport also presently has an insufficient CCTV system in operation.&#13;
Approximately twenty (20) additional cameras, one multiplexer, 5 monitors and 2 VCRs will therefore be&#13;
acquired to provide more complete coverage in areas where continual guard presence is not possible.&#13;
The Vieux-fort port will also require a CCTV system similar to the one at Pointe Seraphine.&#13;
This cost estimate includes the provision of design and supervision (US$40,000).&#13;
* Binoculars for Surveillance (US$22,500)&#13;
One regular and one night-vision pair of binoculars have been included for each airport and for the&#13;
Pointe Seraphine seaport to permit surveillance of airport and port perimeters when physical patrols are&#13;
not possible. This is a reasonable and cost-effective approach, reducing the need for additional personnel&#13;
to conduct continuous patrols.&#13;
1.1.2.3 Institutional Capacity Building (US$305,000 per country)&#13;
This regional component is financed and implemented on an equal share basis among all participating&#13;
countries (US$305,000 per country) and includes the provision of Executive Training (US$15,000),&#13;
Security Operations Training (US$100,000), Specialized Training (US$80,000), Technical Assistance for&#13;
Regulatory Review for Enhanced Security (US$95,000), and Short-term Procurement Services&#13;
58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(US$15,000). The detailed description of each element of the regional training component is given in&#13;
Schedule 1.B.&#13;
1.1.3 Component 3: Project Management (US$270,000)&#13;
This component is aimed at assisting Government in meeting its project management obligations&#13;
through the strengthening of the existing Project Coordination Unit. The project will finance the cost of&#13;
the services of the deputy project coordinator for twenty-four months, an accountant assistant for forty&#13;
months, a contract management assistant for twenty-four months and an administrative assistant for&#13;
twenty-four months. It will also finance training of the newly-hired PCU staff in Bank procedures, the&#13;
acquisition of a computer, a filing cabinet, software equipment for presentations, and operating&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
1.2  Estimated costs&#13;
The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$7,400,000. Detailed cost&#13;
estimates are given in Table 4.B. 1.&#13;
1.3 Financing plan&#13;
Out of a total cost of US$7,400,000, the Bank will finance US$6,300,000 (85 percent of the total&#13;
project cost) and the balance (US$1,100,000) will be financed by the Government. Bank financing will&#13;
consist of a US$1.89 million loan and a SDR3.6 million credit. Financing details are given in Table&#13;

Emergency Recovery Project&#13;
Schedule 4.C&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Project Coordination and Management&#13;
Project Coordination will be the responsibility of Project Coordination Unit (PCU), established&#13;
under the Ministry of Finance and Planning for the Implementation of the Emergency Recovery and&#13;
Disaster Management Project. The PCU will be responsible for managing the different aspects of the&#13;
project, coordinating implementing agencies, keeping accounts, and reporting to the Bank. The PCU&#13;
already includes, on a full time basis, a project coordinator, an accountant and a project assistant.&#13;
Financing will be provided under the project to cover the cost of one accountant assistant, and to extend&#13;
the contracts of the existing PCU staff from June 2003 through June 2005.&#13;
The civil works and equipment elements of the security enhancement component will be&#13;
implemented by the Saint Lucia Airport and Sea Port Authority (SLASPA). To this end, this agency will&#13;
designate a contact person who will work closely under the auspices and the supervision of the PCU and&#13;
will provide progress reports to the PCU on a semi-annual basis. The PCU will handle the procurement&#13;
and contract management responsibilities for these components on behalf of SLASPA.&#13;
While training in the use of security equipment financed under the project will be included in&#13;
each contract and provided by suppliers, specialized training and technical assistance in security&#13;
management, safety, contingency planning, and crisis management, will be carried out through the OECS&#13;
Directorate of Civil Aviation under a separate regional agreement. The OECS Directorate of Civil&#13;
Aviation will ensure the development and implementation of training and technical assistance activities&#13;
on a regional basis.&#13;
The Critical Import component will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.&#13;
All supporting documentation required for disbursements will be assembled by the PCU with the&#13;
assistance of the Customs Department. The PCU will prepare a consolidated quarterly progress report on&#13;
all project activities and submit it to the Bank.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
The civil works under this project consist of: (i) the installation of new fencings along the west-&#13;
end perimeter of George F.L. Charles Airport; (ii) the construction of an addition to the existing terminal&#13;
of a new free-standing facility to house screening equipment for checked baggage at George F.L. Charles&#13;
Airport; (iii) the construction of a roadway along the perimeter of the Hewanorra Airport airfield to&#13;
permit vehicle patrol. Given the nature and expected size of the works, national competitive bidding&#13;
(NCB) would be used with the possibility for foreign firms to participate. Advertisement for these works&#13;
will be made through the announcement of the project in the general procurement notice and an&#13;
announcement in a local newspaper of wide distribution. The total estimated costs of these works are&#13;
expected to range from US$150,000 to US$750,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$1,150,000. Small&#13;
works estimated to cost less than US$100,000 individually would be procured using three quotations&#13;
obtained from qualified contractors.&#13;
Goods and Equipment&#13;
Equipment under the project consist of: (i) ID badging/tracking system and passenger tracking&#13;
and watch list system; (ii) baggage screening systems including walk-through metal detectors,&#13;

used for the procurement of the communication, small equipment and vehicles estimated to cost up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$151,000. Procurement of Patrol boats will be made through Limited&#13;
International Bidding.&#13;
Critical Import&#13;
The main critical import will consist of low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation estimated&#13;
to cost US$2,400,000 and will be procured following established commercial practices found acceptable&#13;
by the Bank and for which disbursement would be made on the basis of agreed import documentation.&#13;
Consultant Services&#13;
Consultants' services consist of: (i) engineering design and supervision for the civil works&#13;
components (buildings, roadways, and fences, etc.); (ii) the hiring of consulting firns or individuals for&#13;
the design and implementation of the Security training program; (iii) technical assistance; (iv) additional&#13;
staff for the PCU; and (v) auditors for the project accounts. The hiring of firms will be made using quality&#13;
and cost-based selection (QCBS) and the hiring of individuals will be made using selection based on&#13;
qualifications.&#13;
Prior Review&#13;
All ICB will require prior review by the Bank. Two copies of the signed contracts should be sent&#13;
to the Bank prior to requesting disbursements against these contracts. The first two NCB procurements&#13;
for civil works, the first two procurements of smaller works and the first procurement of goods under&#13;
local or international shopping will require prior review. All consultants' services estimated to cost above&#13;
US$50,000 will be subject to prior review and all services estimated to cost less than US$50,000 will&#13;
require the prior review of the TORs, contract and CVs.&#13;

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Implementing Entities&#13;
The Ministry of Planning, Development, Environment and Housing (MOPDEH) currently implements the&#13;
Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management project with an established Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU) and will be the implementing entity to coordinate all activities under this project. Regarding the&#13;
financial management arrangements, the PCU has appointed a qualified accountant (who has worked with&#13;
the current Disaster Management project) to oversee all aspects of financial management for the project.&#13;
This staff member will also liaise with the Office of the Accountant General and Customs Department for&#13;
matters of consolidation of documentation for critical imports and accounting information, and for&#13;
monitoring the flow of funds to the project.&#13;
The PCU in the MOPDEH has an adequate financial management system. The PCU has recently&#13;
received training in the Bank's (new) financial management requirements and is currently successfully&#13;
operating under PMR-based disbursements.&#13;
In order to accommodate the additional work demands and requirements, an accounting assistant will be&#13;
added to the PCU staff.&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
Procedures for flow of funds from the loan and the required counterpart contribution will be implemented&#13;
with due regard to safeguarding project's resources and ensuring timely execution of payments.&#13;
Loan funds will be disbursed to one Special Account (US dollar account for Bank funds), and this account&#13;
will be utilized for the purposes of the implementation arrangements agreed. As is the current practice in&#13;
St. Lucia, the Special Account will be opened by the Ministry of Finance and maintained in a commercial&#13;
bank. The management of this account will be the responsibility of the PCU. The PCU will transfer&#13;
funds from the Special Account to the project account, from which checks or transfers (in local currency)&#13;
will be issued to the providers of goods and services. The project will reconcile (monthly) both the&#13;
project account as well as the Special Account, and submit the documentation regarding both accounts, to&#13;
the Bank under each withdrawal application and Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs).&#13;
The Ministry of Finance/MOPDEH will incorporate into the final fiscal year 2002-03 budget estimates, a&#13;
request for project funding for the first year of implementation, and it is expected that subsequent project&#13;
64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
funding requirements will be included in future government, budget and planning estimates as well. The&#13;
Government of St. Lucia will allocate its counterpart funding (US$400,000 for 2002-03 and US$669,500&#13;
for 2003-04) into a local operational project account.&#13;
The establishment of the new Special Account and the deposit of government's first year contribution in&#13;
the local operational account will be required prior to effectiveness.&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
Administrative procedures are in place to ensure that financial transactions are made with consideration to&#13;
safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry in the accounting/monitoring systems. The project&#13;
accounting system has the capacity to record assets, liabilities and financial transactions of the project,&#13;
and produce financial statements useful to project management and meeting IBRD's fiduciary&#13;
requirements. The accounting system is designed to be able to capture all financial information and&#13;
allocate among both categories (the Bank's legal/disbursement categories and GOSL Budget categories)&#13;
and project activity.&#13;
The project will also submit detailed monthly statements of expenditures to the Office of the Accountant&#13;
General and to the MOPDEH in order that the project's expenditures are recorded on the Ministry's&#13;
accounts as well as supervised by the unit responsible for management of external financing.&#13;
Accounting. Accounting and budgetary records will be maintained in accordance with the GOSL's&#13;
procedures, under the FAA Act and which are satisfactory to the Bank. However, for Bank monitoring&#13;
purposes the PCU will report on detailed information at the project level, specifically the deposits to the&#13;
special account and the expenditures classified by activity/ subcomponent and disbursement category.&#13;
The project has implemented a basic system that will be able to account for all financial transactions by&#13;
source of financing and by either general category or project activity detail.&#13;
Safeguard over assets. For the proposed project, the PCU will keep detailed subsidiary records of plant&#13;
and equipment acquired. The amounts in this register will be reconciled monthly against the respective&#13;
accounting balances. At least one annual physical inspection will be undertaken by MOPDEH/PCU staff,&#13;
preferably with the participation of staff from the Auditor General's Department&#13;
ExternalAudit&#13;
Audit arrangements. Annual project financial statements will be audited in accordance with&#13;
International Standards on Auditing, by the Auditor's General Department and in accordance with terms&#13;
of reference (TORs) acceptable to the Bank. In addition to the audit opinions on project financial&#13;
statements, Special Accounts and FMRs, special purpose reports will be required to deal specifically with&#13;
observance of the procurement and consultants services provisions of the Loan Agreement. The&#13;
memorandum on internal controls ("management letter") will be issued annually.&#13;
The PCU will prepare, if needed, an action plan to address any issues and recommendations contained in&#13;
the audit reports. The action plan and follow-up activities would be communicated to the Bank.&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
Financial statements and reports will be prepared in formats satisfying the Government and IBRD's&#13;
monitoring and fiduciary purposes.&#13;
On a monthly basis (at least), the PCU will prepare the project's basic Statement of Expenditure, a matrix&#13;
classifying receipts by financing source and expenditures by financing source and disbursement (or&#13;
government expenditure) category. This report is submitted to the Office of the Accountant General and&#13;
to the MOPDEH.&#13;
In addition to Statement of Expenditure, the monthly financial reports will include the Special Account&#13;
Reconciliation Statements. Any difference in the amount of expenditures reported under the two financial&#13;
statements must be clearly explained. The project financial statements, along with the physical progress&#13;
and procurement sections of the FMRs, will be submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis, and will be&#13;
65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
submitted no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarter. The contents of the FMRs have&#13;
been discussed, and the formats of the reports will be finalized by loan negotiations.&#13;
The PCU will be responsible to liaise with the Directorate of Civil Aviation (the DCA, located in&#13;
Antigua) to consolidate the accounting and procurement information of the Training and Technical&#13;
Component, which will be implemented by the DCA. The PCU will receive each month a copy of the&#13;
Special Account reconciliation and a detailed monthly Statement of Expenditure. The PCU is also&#13;
responsible to include this information in the FMRs submitted to the Bank each quarter. The PCU will&#13;
maintain copies of all financial transactions and relevant documentation and the annual audit for the PCU&#13;
will cover this component implemented by the DCA.&#13;

ST. VINCENT AND THE GREANDINES&#13;
EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Schedule 5.A&#13;
Economic Impact and Recovery Program&#13;
Impact on the tourism sector. The tourism sector in St. Vincent is distinct from others in the&#13;
OECS because of the large yachting sub-sector which accounts for around 40 percent of overall tourism&#13;
earnings. In 2001, yacht visitors were growing rapidly in the first eight months, up 27 percent from&#13;
January - August 2000. Stay-over arrivals, on the other hand, were generally flat with respect to 2000.&#13;
After September I1, however, arrivals of both yacht and stayover visitors slowed down sharply. On&#13;
average, hotels reported occupancy rates some 20 percent below normal levels. For some smaller&#13;
properties, this meant very few or no visitors at all, while others were limited to repeat visitors only.&#13;
Despite this, St. Vincent has not witnessed any property closures, nor outright layoffs of hotel staff.&#13;
Hotels have been discounting their accommodation rates by around 20 percent in an effort to encourage&#13;
visitors. They have also made widespread reductions in work shift hours. Barring further incidents,&#13;
arrivals are expected to recover gradually throughout 2002, so that by the last quarter the number of&#13;
visitors would equal the levels projected prior to the terrorist attacks.&#13;

Overall impact. The combination of the fall in arrivals and discounted rates has yielded an&#13;
estimated loss of around EC$11 million in 2001 and EC$27 million in 2002, or 5 and 13 percent of&#13;
projected earnings, respectively. In terms of the broader economic impact, while the loss of earnings may&#13;
be compensated in part by reduced imports, the external current account balance is expected to deteriorate&#13;
by EC$8 and 19 million, respectively in 2001 and 2002. Regarding foreign direct investment, which in&#13;
the tourism sector had been stagnating recently, there has been little evidence of delay or cancellation,&#13;
with the exception of the one luxury villa development project which may see a further delay due to a&#13;
scarcity of buyers in the current global economic climate. Real GDP is estimated to have contracted&#13;
marginally in 2001, as compared with original projections of about 0.6 percent growth. In 2002, real&#13;
GDP growth is now projected to increase by 0.9 percent versus 1.6 percent in the counterfactual scenario.&#13;
The fiscal accounts have also been negatively affected and the Govemment has taken some measures to&#13;
address deterioration - the combined impact is discussed below.&#13;
Tourism sector relief and promotional efforts.  In an effort to encourage more visitors to&#13;
St. Vincent, the Government increased its allocation for tourist promotion in the 2002 budget by over&#13;
20 percent, to around EC$3 million. St. Vincent will also participate in the Regional Tourism Emergency&#13;
Programme, with the Government's share of the cost (US$112,500) financed through a concessional loan&#13;
from the CDB. In addition, the Government has made an extraordinary allocation of EC$50,000 to the St.&#13;
71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Vincent and the Grenadines Hotel and Tourism Association to support that organization's promotional&#13;
efforts at this time.&#13;

Regarding airlift, the Government has reduced aircraft parking and landing fees by 25 percent for&#13;
a six-month period starting January 1, 2002. With the expansion of Caribbean Star, a subregional airline,&#13;
in St. Vincent, the islands have improved access from within the region, but have suffered from the&#13;
general reduction in airlift into the subregion. In an effort to counter this, St. Vincent has committed&#13;
£53,475 (about US$76,500), financed equally by the Government and the private sector, to guarantee 40&#13;
seats on a new charter service from the UK to Grenada. Negotiations are still underway regarding&#13;
potential delays in Grenada, and the possibility of a dedicated LIAT flight to transfer passengers to St.&#13;
Vincent. The Government has also established hub facilities at St. Lucia's Hewanorra International&#13;
Airport to offer pre-flight immigration and customs clearance. There are plans for developing similar&#13;
arrangements in Barbados.&#13;
The authorities have reduced the company tax rate on hotels from 40 to 35 percent with effect&#13;
from the 2002 income year, which should provide some relief to the hotel sector during the recovery&#13;
period. Regarding the cruise sector, the Government proposes to develop a program of attractions geared&#13;
to cruise ship passengers, in collaboration with the private sector in 2002. The OECS as a whole recently&#13;
agreed to institute a uniform cruise ship service charge (head tax) of US$5, not including the&#13;
environmental tax of US$1.50 per passenger. For St. Vincent, this represents a reduction from the current&#13;
rate of US$7.50 which went into effect on January 1, 2002. Additionally, the Government is negotiating&#13;
volume discounts with individual lines. With respect to the yachting sector, St. Vincent has recently&#13;
revised the fee structure for yacht licences and proposes to establish two new ports of entry at&#13;
VillalCanash and Chateaublair.&#13;
Finally, in an effort to ensure the safety and security of its visitors, St. Vincent is in the process of&#13;
establishing a Tourism Police Unit, with branches in several major tourist centers, including a mobile unit&#13;
to serve Union Island and other Grenadines.&#13;
Expanding critical social programs. In light of the new economic situation, the authorities&#13;
have accelerated the public investment program, in particular those labor-intensive projects that will&#13;
generate employment and incomes for the poor. The Government hopes to raise the implementation rate&#13;
of public investment projects significantly in 2002. In addition, the Government plans to focus the&#13;
upcoming tranche of European Development Fund resources (Euro 9.7 million) on the restructuring of the&#13;
banana sector in order to help farmers and other rural poor diversify their income-earning activities. In&#13;
2002, the majority of these new resources will be allocated to "immediate impact" activities such as&#13;
employment programs, skills training, microenterprise development, and some social relief. The&#13;
72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Government will extend an ongoing labor-intensive road repair program that has been very effective in&#13;
the past as a means of increasing rural incomes. Multipurpose training centers will also be established&#13;
throughout the islands. This will be supplemented by a program of assistance for microenterprise&#13;
development. For those farmers who are unable to either improve their competitiveness or make the&#13;
transition to new activities, the Government has set aside an amount of EC$I million to provide pensions.&#13;
As a longer-term measure, the Government also plans to use the EDF resources to initiate a land titling&#13;
program targeted at the rural poor.&#13;
Fiscal measures.  In view of declining revenues and increased expenditure needs, the&#13;
Government has taken a number of measures toward increasing its resources during the recovery period.&#13;
In particular, the Government will make improvements in tax administration, including the addition of&#13;
new staff on customs valuation and in the inland revenue audit department. Duty-free concessions have&#13;
been curtailed in an attempt to widen the tax base. At the same time, the consumption tax and stamp&#13;
duties on selected items have been increased in 2002, along with a general upward revision of various&#13;
user fees and licenses. An interest levy has been extended from banks to all financial institutions. Finally,&#13;
the departure tax has been increased from EC$30 to EC$35 in an attempt to recover the costs of new&#13;
promotional efforts, product development costs, increased security measures, and environmental&#13;
management.&#13;
Strengthening oversight of the offshore sector. The events of September 11 have reinforced&#13;
the importance of the regulatory changes which the authorities were already undertaking in the offshore&#13;
sector in response to being included on the FATF List of Non-cooperating countries and territories. The&#13;
Offshore Financial Authority, established in 1976, had been restructured in 1996 into an official&#13;
regulatory agency. More recently, however, the Government installed a new board, management team&#13;
and key technical staff. The Authority has also received technical assistance from the IMF, OECD/FATF,&#13;
the ECCB and the Caribbean Anti-Money Laundering Programme for strengthening its operations. In&#13;
July 2001, the Authority entered into an "administrative procedures agreement" with the ECCB to share&#13;
supervisory functions. Currently, the ECCB undertakes a secondary evaluation of new bank licences (the&#13;
first stage is handled by the Authority on the basis of due diligence reports prepared by the US National&#13;
Fraud Center) and is collaborating with the Authority in on-site supervision.&#13;
In December 2001, the Government passed the new Proceeds of Crime Money-Laundering&#13;
(Prevention) Act and a new Financial Intelligence Unit Act. The former establishes a wide definition of&#13;
money-laundering offenses in line with the FATF criteria and creates broader responsibilities throughout&#13;
the financial sector regarding the reporting of suspicious transactions. Regulations to support that Act&#13;
went into effect on January 22, 2002.  The Authority held consultations on the legislation with&#13;
stakeholders in the sector, and is now starting a campaign to educate domestic and offshore financial&#13;
institutions on their new responsibilities. The Financial Intelligence Unit Act basically eliminates earlier&#13;
confidentiality protections in St. Vincent's offshore sector by granting the FIU wide powers of&#13;
investigation and information-sharing. Staff have been recruited and trained for the unit. Most recently,&#13;
St Vincent became a signatory to the convention regarding the suppression of financing for international&#13;
terrorism. The Government hopes that, on the basis of these ongoing improvements in the off-shore&#13;
sector, St. Vincent can be de-listed by the FATF as early as June 2002.&#13;

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES&#13;
Emergency Recovery Project&#13;
Schedule 5.B&#13;
Project Components, Estimated Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
1.1  Project components&#13;
1.1.1  Component 1: Critical Import (US$1,200,000)&#13;
This component will finance one critical import, low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation,&#13;
which is critical to maintaining economic activity in the tourism industry by ensuring that the energy-&#13;
intensive tourism facilities are kept operational during the recovery period. The inclusion of this sole&#13;
import is based on an assessment of St. Vincent's monthly import bill and review of satisfactory&#13;
procurement practices.&#13;
1.1.2  Component 2: Security Enhancement at ports and airports (US$2,050,000)&#13;
This cost estimates include design and supervision (US$30,000).&#13;
1.1.2.1 Physical Improvement of infrastructure&#13;
* E.T. Joshua International Airport Fencing (US$350,000) and Roadway Improvement&#13;
(US$300,000)&#13;
As portions of the perimeter fencing are damaged, missing, or incomplete, it is essential that an effort&#13;
be made to provide ICAO-compliant perimeter fencing in that area. Approximately one and a half miles&#13;
of the airport's perimeter, are to be provided with new fencing. In addition to the fencing, and in order to&#13;
enable the security vehicle to patrol the airport perimeter, it is essential to provide a stable roadway,&#13;
including sub-grade stabilization in unstable or swampy areas.&#13;
* Improvement for Checked Baggage Screening Facility in E.T. Joshua International Airport&#13;
(US$25,000)&#13;
The second improvement that will be undertaken at E.T. Joshua International Airport will consist of&#13;
the construction of an enclosed area to accommodate the baggage screening equipment behind the&#13;
existing check-in area. As ICAO moves toward 100 percent screening of checked bags, the airport will&#13;
need to house the required machinery and to provide personnel to accomplish this task.&#13;
* Access and building improvement at Kingstown Seaport (US$100,000)&#13;
In order to enable the screening of cruise passengers and crew, it will be necessary to make some&#13;
modifications (air-conditioning and door openings) to existing facilities and guard house at the cruise&#13;
passenger terminal and to improve vehicle access to and exit from the passenger drop-off area.&#13;
1.1.2.2 Security Equipment&#13;
* Checked Baggage Screening System in E.T. Joshua International Airport (US$90,000)&#13;
The airport presently has no operational checked-baggage screening systems. As 100 percent&#13;
screening of checked baggage is likely to become an ICAO requirement, a screening unit including belt&#13;
will be purchased for use in the enclosed area described above.&#13;
*  ID Badging and Tracking System (US$250,000)&#13;
The authorities presently issue identification (ID) credentials manually, and maintain the E.T. Joshua&#13;
airport and port IDs in a physical file. In order to improve the system, special badging and tracking&#13;
equipment will be purchased and provided both for the port and the airport personnel. The project will&#13;
finance the acquisition of two systems (one for the port, one for the airport) that will automate the&#13;
issuance, tracking, and cancellation of IDs for personnel.&#13;
74&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* Passenger and Hand Baggage Screening Systems for the Airports (E.T. Joshua International and&#13;
Canouan Airport at the Grenadines Island) and the Port (US$268,000)&#13;
Neither the airports nor the port have X-ray screening machines for passengers' carry-on baggage.&#13;
Four complete scanning stations (one for each airport and two for the port) will be acquired. Each station&#13;
will consist of a baggage x-ray scanner, a WTM, and an uninterruptible power system (UPS). About&#13;
twenty (20) handheld metal detectors ("wands") will also be acquired for use as secondary portable&#13;
screening devices.&#13;
* Airport Security Patrol Vehicle (US$32,000)&#13;
One four-wheel drive sport utility vehicle (SUV) will be financed by the project, to enable the&#13;
patrolling of the terminal exterior, parking lots, airport operating area, and perimeter fencing. It will also&#13;
be equipped with light bars (per ICAO Standards for airport vehicles) and communications equipment.&#13;
*  Sniffers (US$130,000)&#13;
As no system is presently available for detecting the presence of chemicals and explosives, neither at&#13;
the E.T. Joshua airport nor at the port, two electronic "sniffers" for chemical and explosive detection will&#13;
be financed. This estimate includes the housing of the equipment, and air-conditioning as appropriate.&#13;
*  Communications Equipment for the Airports and Ports (US$30,000)&#13;
Presently, very few of the security guards at the airports or the port have hand-held radios to&#13;
communicate with each other or with other critical units, such as air traffic control, crash fire rescue&#13;
(CFR) crews, or police units. A minimum of twenty-one (21) hand-held units will be purchased, along&#13;
with three repeater units and two vehicle-mounted units. The costs of extra batteries and battery charging&#13;
units have been factored in to the above estimates.&#13;
* Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) System ($150,000)&#13;
The port and the E.T. Joshua International airport presently have a CCTV system in operation, though&#13;
there are blind spots where camera coverage is not available. The project will finance the acquisition of&#13;
about twenty-two (22) additional cameras, monitors and VCRs to provide more complete coverage in&#13;
areas where continual guard presence is not possible, both at the port and the E.T. Joshua International&#13;
airport.&#13;
This cost estimates include design and supervision (US$10,000).&#13;
1.1.2.3 Institutional Capacity Building&#13;
This regional component is financed and implemented on an equal share basis among all participating&#13;
countries (US$305,000 per country) and includes the provision of Executive Training (US$15,000),&#13;
Security Operations Training (US$100,000), Specialized Training (US$80,000), Technical Assistance for&#13;
Regulatory Review for Enhanced Security (US$95,000), and Short-term Procurement Services&#13;
(US$15,000). The detailed description of each element of the regional training component is given in&#13;
Schedule I.B.&#13;
1.1.3 Component 3: Project Management (US$230,000)&#13;
This component is aimed at assisting Government in meeting its project management obligations through&#13;
the strengthening of the existing Project Coordination Unit. A procurement specialist will be hired under&#13;
the loan/credit proceeds for two years (US$105,000). This component will also provide financing for&#13;
office equipment (US$20,000) and other operating expenditures for the PCU (US$30,000), as well as for&#13;
financial audits (US$75,000) of the entire project every fiscal year.&#13;
75&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.2 Estimated costs&#13;
The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$3,800,000. Detailed cost&#13;
estimates are given in Table 5.B. 1.&#13;
1.3 Financing plan&#13;
Out of a total cost of US$3,800,000, the Bank will finance US$3,200,000 (84 percent of the total&#13;
project cost) and the balance (US$600,000) will be financed by the Government. Bank financing will&#13;
consist of a US$0.96 million loan and a SDR1.9 million credit. Financing details are given in Table&#13;
5.B.2.&#13;

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES&#13;
Emergency Recovery Project&#13;
Schedule 5.C&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Project Coordination and Management&#13;
Project Coordination will be the responsibility of Project Coordination Unit (PCU), recently&#13;
established under the Ministry of Finance and Planning for the Implementation of the Emergency&#13;
Recovery and Disaster Management Project. The PCU will be responsible for managing the different&#13;
aspects of the project, coordinating implementing agencies, keeping accounts, and reporting to the Bank.&#13;
The PCU already includes, on a full time basis, a project coordinator and an accountant. Financing will&#13;
be provided under the project to cover the cost of one procurement specialist.&#13;
The civil works and equipment elements of the security enhancement component will be&#13;
implemented by the respective Airport and Seaport Authorities. To this end, these agencies will designate&#13;
a contact person who will work closely under the auspices and the supervision of the PCU and will&#13;
provide progress reports to the PCU on a quarterly basis. The procurement officer of the PCU will handle&#13;
the procurement and contract management responsibilities for these components on behalf of the relevant&#13;
implementing agencies.&#13;
While training in the use of security equipment financed under the project will be included in&#13;
each contract and provided by suppliers, specialized training and technical assistance in security&#13;
management, safety, contingency planning, and crisis management, will be carried out through the OECS&#13;
Directorate of Civil Aviation under a separate regional agreement. The OECS Directorate of Civil&#13;
Aviation will ensure the development and implementation of training and technical assistance activities&#13;
on a regional basis.&#13;
The Critical Import component will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.&#13;
All supporting documentation required for disbursements will be assembled by the PCU with the&#13;
assistance of the Customs Department. The PCU will prepare a consolidated quarterly progress report on&#13;
all project activities and submit it to the Bank.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
The civil works under this project consist of: (i) the installation of new perimeter fencings at E.T.&#13;
Joshua International Airport; (ii) improvement for checked baggage screening facility (construction of an&#13;
enclosed area); (iii) the construction of roadway for patrol vehicle; and (iv) access and building&#13;
improvement at the seaport. The total estimated costs of these works are expected to range from&#13;
US$25,000 to US$350,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$775,000. Given the nature and expected&#13;
size of the works, national competitive bidding (NCB) would be used for contracts above US$100,000&#13;
with the possibility for foreign firms to participate. Advertisement for these works will be made through&#13;
the announcement of the project in the general procurement notice and an announcement in a local&#13;
newspaper of wide distribution. Small works estimated to cost less than US$100,000 individually would&#13;
be procured using three quotations obtained from qualified contractors.&#13;
Goods and Enuipment&#13;
Equipment under the project consist of: (i) ID badging/tracking system and passenger tracking&#13;
and watch list system; (ii) baggage screening systems including walk-through metal detectors,&#13;
uninterrupted power system units, handheld metal detectors and sniffers; (iii) close-circuit television&#13;
systems; (iv) airport security patrol vehicles; (v) small communication system equipment such as hand-&#13;
held radios, base units radios and vehicle-mounted units. The procurement of the primary equipment i.e.,&#13;
items (i), (ii) and (iii) above with estimated aggregate costs of US$250,000, US$488,000, and&#13;
79&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
US$140,000 respectively will be carried out through ICB procedures. All equipment contracts will&#13;
include installation or supervision of installation, training on the equipment operation and maintenance, as&#13;
appropriate. International and/or national shopping procedures would be used for the procurement of the&#13;
communication, small equipment and vehicle estimated to cost up to an aggregate amount of US$82,000.&#13;
Critical ImDort&#13;
The main critical import will consist of low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation estimated&#13;
to cost US$1,200,000 and will be procured following established commercial practices found acceptable&#13;
by the Bank and for which disbursement would be made on the basis of agreed import documentation.&#13;
Consultant Services&#13;
Consultants' services consist of: (i) engineering design and supervision for the civil works&#13;
components (buildings, roadways, and fences, etc.); (ii) the hiring of consulting firms or individuals&#13;
(through the OECS Directorate of Civil Aviation) for the design and implementation of the Security&#13;
training program; (iii) technical assistance; (iv) additional staff for the PCU; and (v) auditors for the&#13;
project accounts. The hiring of firms will be made using quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) and the&#13;
hiring of individuals will be made using selection based on qualifications.&#13;
Prior Review&#13;
All ICB will require prior review by the Bank. Two copies of the signed contracts should be sent&#13;
to the Bank prior to requesting disbursements against these contracts. The first two NCB procurements&#13;
for civil works, the first two procurements of smaller works and the first procurement of goods under&#13;
local or international shopping will require prior review. All consultants' services estimated to cost above&#13;
US$50,000 will be subject to prior review and all services estimated to cost less than US$50,000 will&#13;
require the prior review of the TORs, contract and CVs.&#13;

Implementing Entities&#13;
The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) will be the implementing entity and a Project&#13;
Coordination Unit (PCU) has been established within the Ministry to coordinate all activities under this&#13;
project.  Regarding the financial management arrangements, the PCU has appointed a qualified&#13;
accountant (who had worked with a previous Bank project) to oversee all aspects of financial&#13;
management for the project. This staff member will also liaise with the Office of the Accountant General&#13;
and Customs Department for matters of consolidation of documentation for critical imports and&#13;
accounting information, and for monitoring the flow of funds to the project.&#13;
The PCU had been involved with the preparation of the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management&#13;
project (under the Regional APL) and has established some key aspects of the financial management.&#13;
However, since this is a new project unit to implement a Bank project, there are specific aspects to the&#13;
overall financial management system that have been identified as needing modification and below is the&#13;
financial management action plan:&#13;

Funds Flow&#13;
Procedures for flow of funds from the loan and the required counterpart contribution will be implemented&#13;
with due regard to safeguarding project's resources and ensuring timely execution of payments.&#13;
Loan funds will be disbursed to one Special Account (US dollar account for Bank funds), and this account&#13;
will be utilized for the purposes of the implementation arrangements agreed upon. As is the current&#13;
practice in St. Vincent, the Special Account will be opened by the Ministry of Finance and Planning&#13;
(MOFP) and maintained in a commercial bank. The management of this account will be the&#13;
81&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
responsibility of the PCU. The PCU will transfer funds from the Special Account to the project account,&#13;
from which checks or transfers (in local currency) will be issued to the providers of goods and services.&#13;
The project will reconcile (monthly) both the project account as well as the Special Account, and submit&#13;
the documentation regarding both accounts, to the Bank under each withdrawal application and Statement&#13;
of Expenditure (SOE).&#13;
The Ministry of Finance will prepare a Special Appropriations Warrant to request project funding for the&#13;
first year of implementation, and it is expected that subsequent project funding requirements will be&#13;
included in future government budget and planning estimates. The Govemment of St. Vincent will&#13;
allocate its counterpart funding (US$300,000 for 2002-03 and US$269,500 for 2003-04) into a local&#13;
operational project account.&#13;
The establishment of the new Special Account and the deposit of govemment's first year contribution in&#13;
the local operational account will be required prior to effectiveness.&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
Administrative procedures will be in place to ensure that financial transactions are made with&#13;
consideration to safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry in the accounting/monitoring&#13;
systems. The project already has a working draft of the operations manual, which is in the process of&#13;
being finalized. The project accounting system has the capacity to record assets, liabilities and financial&#13;
transactions of the project, and produce financial statements useful to project management and meeting&#13;
IBRD's fiduciary requirements. The accounting system is designed to be able to capture all financial&#13;
information and allocate among both categories (the Bank's legal/disbursement categories and GOSVG&#13;
Budget categories) and project activity.&#13;
The project will also submit detailed monthly statements of expenditures to the Office of the Accountant&#13;
General and to the MOFP in order that the project's expenditures are recorded on the Ministry's accounts&#13;
as well as supervised by the unit responsible for management of extemal financing.&#13;
Accounting. Accounting and budgetary records will be maintained in accordance with the GOSVG's&#13;
procedures, under the FAA Act and which are satisfactory to the Bank. However, for Bank monitoring&#13;
purposes the PCU will report on detailed information at the project level, specifically the deposits to the&#13;
special account and the expenditures classified by activity/ subcomponent and disbursement category.&#13;
The project has implemented a basic system that will be able to account for all financial transactions by&#13;
source of financing and by either general category or project activity detail.&#13;
Safeguard over assets. For the proposed project, the PCU will keep detailed subsidiary records of plant&#13;
and equipment acquired. The amounts in this register will be reconciled monthly against the respective&#13;
accounting balances. At least one annual physical inspection will be undertaken by MOFP/PCU staff,&#13;
preferably with the participation of staff from the extemal auditors and the Auditor General's Department&#13;
External Audit&#13;
Audit arrangements. Annual project financial statements will be audited in accordance with&#13;
International Standards on Auditing, by an independent firm and in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
(TORs) both acceptable to the Bank. In addition to the audit opinions on project financial statements,&#13;
Special Accounts, and SOEs, special purpose reports will be required to deal specifically with observance&#13;
of the procurement and consultants services provisions of the Loan Agreement. The memorandum on&#13;
internal controls ("management letter") will be issued annually.&#13;
The Terms of Reference for the independent annual audit has already been cleared and approved by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
The PCU will prepare, if needed, an action plan to address any issues and recommendations contained in&#13;
the audit reports. The action plan and follow-up activities would be communicated to the Bank.&#13;
82&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
Financial statements and reports will be prepared in formats satisfying the Government and IBRD's&#13;
monitoring and fiduciary purposes.&#13;
On a monthly basis (at least), the PCU will prepare the project's basic Statement of Expenditure, a matrix&#13;
classifying receipts by financing source and expenditures by financing source and disbursement category.&#13;
This report is submitted to the Office of the Accountant General and to the MOFP.&#13;
In addition to Statement of Expenditure, the monthly financial reports will include the Special Account&#13;
Reconciliation Statements. Any difference in the amount of expenditures reported under the two financial&#13;
statements must be clearly explained. The project financial statements, along with the physical progress&#13;
and procurement sections of the FMRs, will be submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis, and will be&#13;
submitted no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarter. The contents of the FMRs have&#13;
been discussed, and the formats of the reports will be finalized by loan negotiations.&#13;
The PCU will be responsible to liaise with the Directorate of Civil Aviation (the DCA, located in&#13;
Antigua) to consolidate the accounting and procurement information of the Training and Technical&#13;
Component, which will be implemented by the DCA. The PCU will receive each month a copy of the&#13;
Special Account reconciliation and a detailed monthly Statement of Expenditure. The PCU is also&#13;
responsible to include this information in the FMRs submitted to the Bank each quarter. The PCU will&#13;
maintain copies of all financial transactions and relevant documentation and the annual audit for the PCU&#13;
will cover this component implemented by the DCA.&#13;

EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
OECS Directorate of Civil Aviation: Implementation Arrangements&#13;
The OECS Directorate of Civil Aviation (DCA), located in Antigua, is currently under the direction of the&#13;
OECS General Secretariat and will be responsible for implementing the Training and Technical&#13;
Assistance Component of the project. To this end, the DCA will be strengthened with specialized&#13;
expertise in order to procure all relevant training and consulting services.&#13;
Regarding the financial management arrangements, the DCA has a qualified accountant to oversee all&#13;
aspects of financial management for the project. This staff member will also liaise with the each of the&#13;
project coordinating units with regards to the procurement documents and accounting information of the&#13;
component, and for monitoring the flow of funds to the project. The DCA also has an adequate financial&#13;
management system to manage the funds on behalf of the five participating nations.&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
Procedures for flow of funds from the loan and the required counterpart contribution will be implemented&#13;
with due regard to safeguarding project's resources and ensuring timely execution of payments.&#13;
Loan funds will be disbursed to one Special Account (US dollar account for Bank funds), located in a&#13;
commercial bank, and this account will be utilized for the purposes of the implementation arrangements&#13;
agreed. The funding of the component under the loans and credits will be shared equally among each of&#13;
the five participating countries.&#13;
The DCA will transfer funds from the Special Account to the project account, from which checks or&#13;
transfers (in local currency) will be issued to the providers of goods and services. The DCA will&#13;
reconcile (monthly) both the project account as well as the Special Account, and submit the&#13;
documentation regarding both accounts, to the Bank under each withdrawal application and Statement of&#13;
Expenditure (SOE)..&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
Administrative procedures are in place to ensure that financial transactions are made with consideration to&#13;
safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry in the accounting/monitoring systems. The project&#13;
accounting system has the capacity to record assets, liabilities and financial transactions of the project,&#13;
and produce financial statements useful to project management and that meet IBRD's basic fiduciary&#13;
requirements.&#13;
The project will also submit detailed monthly statements of expenditures to each of the project&#13;
coordinating units in order that the DCA's expenditures are recorded on the individual PCU's accounts.&#13;
Audit arrangements&#13;
The annual audit for each PCU (in each country) will cover audit of the component implemented by the&#13;
DCA. While the DCA will maintain all original documents, it will be responsible to forward copies of all&#13;
financial transactions and relevant documentation to each of the PCU's in order to facilitate the audit&#13;
locally.&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
On a monthly basis (at least), the DCA will prepare the project's basic Statement of Expenditure, a matrix&#13;
classifying receipts by financing source and expenditures by financing source and disbursement (or&#13;
government expenditure) category.&#13;
In addition to Statement of Expenditure, the monthly financial reports will include the Special Account&#13;
Reconciliation Statements. Any difference in the amount of expenditures reported under the two financial&#13;
statements must be clearly explained. Each PCU will be responsible to consolidate this information into&#13;
its financial statements (monthly government reports and quarterly FMRs).&#13;

            Organization of Eastern Caribbean States
            (OECS) - Five Emergency Recovery Projects (Dominica,
            Grenada, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent
            and the Grenadines)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report combines five emergency
            recovery programs for five member states of the Organization
            of Eastern Caribbean States--Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts
            and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
            The development objectives of these five Bank operations
            are: 1) to help safeguard and maintain the productive
            capacity of the countries' tourism sectors, notably by
            securing the industry's emergency needs in the
            aftermath of the September 11 events; 2) to enhance security
            at key airport and seaport facilities in line with
            international standards, with the aim of preventing further
            acts of terrorism and safeguarding the sub-region's
            image as a safe tourist destination; and 3) to strengthen
            the countries' institutional capacity to develop and
            implement security plans, procedures, and measures as
            mandated by the international civil aviation and marine
            transport regulatory agencies. There are two main project
            components. The first finances one critical import, low
            sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation, which is
            critical to the maintenance of economic activity in the
            tourism industry by ensuring that the energy-intensive
            tourism facilities are kept operational during the recovery
            period. The second component finances the physical and
            technical resources needed for national port and aviation
            authorities, as well as individual airports and seaports, to
            upgrade security arrangements at key facilities and meet
            international regulations.
