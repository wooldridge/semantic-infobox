   Executive summary: On a stable path&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Progress on reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity need to be further enhanced in the near-term by sustaining&#13;
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and remittances growth, creating jobs, containing inflation, and making progress on improving&#13;
the quality of public service delivery. Private investments need to increase significantly to achieve the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 7 percent growth&#13;
target for FY16. Moving forward in the immediate future, stronger attention is needed to (i) achieve safety and labor rights&#13;
compliance in the garment industry, (ii) complete the critical ongoing road, electricity and gas development projects, (iii) implement&#13;
the Public Private Partnership (PPP) law, (iv) improve the efficiency and solvency of the banking sector through better banking&#13;
supervision and oversight by the Bangladesh Bank and corporate governance reforms in public banks, and (v) provide access to&#13;
serviced land to domestic and foreign investors through the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) initiative.&#13;
&#13;
 Poverty reduction is          Poverty headcount based on US$ 1.25 per day PPP is projected to fall from 43.5&#13;
 projected to have             percent in 2010 to 38.4 percent in 2015. This steady reduction is mainly attributable&#13;
 continued at its              to improvements in the income of rural households. Indeed, the main contributor&#13;
 historic pace                 to poverty reduction between 2005 and 2010 was labor income, largely driven by&#13;
 consistent with the           increases in farm income.&#13;
 observed stable&#13;
 growth.&#13;
&#13;
 Growth momentum               As in FY14, economic activities in FY15 suffered setbacks due to prolonged&#13;
 regained with the             political turmoil in the third quarter. Export growth (in US$) declined to 3.4&#13;
 return of political           percent, but remittance growth recovered to 7.7 percent. The Bangladesh Bureau of&#13;
 stability.                    Statistics (BBS) provisionally estimated FY15 GDP growth at 6.5 percent, compared&#13;
                               with 6 percent the previous year. Growth was driven by rise in industrial growth&#13;
                               from 8.2 percent in FY14 to 9.6 percent in FY15. On the demand side,&#13;
                               consumption growth dominated while real private investment growth declined&#13;
                               somewhat.&#13;
&#13;
 Inflation has declined.       Overall consumer inflation decreased to 6.4 percent in FY15 from 7.3 percent the&#13;
                               previous year, driven by decrease in food inflation. Non-food inflation increased&#13;

                                                                                                                            i&#13;
&amp;#12;   On a stable path                                             Bangladesh Development Update&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          due to supply disruptions caused by the political unrest in the first quarter of 2015.&#13;
                          The gap between rural and urban food inflation narrowed. Prudent aggregate&#13;
                          demand management helped limit inflation volatility while declining international&#13;
                          commodity prices contributed to reducing inflation. There is evidence of&#13;
                          asymmetric inflation inertia in Bangladesh. Domestic price response to international&#13;
                          price decreases is much slower than the response to international price increases.&#13;
&#13;
 Foreign exchange         Due to rise in the trade deficit from $6.8 billion in FY14 to $9.9 billion in FY15,&#13;
 reserve                  reflecting a fall in export growth coupled with a rise in growth of imports, the&#13;
 accumulation has         current account balance turned into a $1.65 billion deficit, compared with a surplus&#13;
 continued despite        of $1.4 billion the previous year. Notwithstanding the current account deficit, the&#13;
 the emergence of         overall balance of payment continued to record a surplus, albeit down from about&#13;
 deficit in the current   $5.5 billion in FY14 to $4.4 billion in FY15, thus sustaining the appreciation&#13;
 account.                 pressure on the nominal exchange rate. The Bangladesh Bank (BB) remained active&#13;
                          on the buying side of the foreign exchange market to prevent any significant&#13;
                          nominal exchange rate appreciation. BB interventions perpetuated foreign exchange&#13;
                          reserve build up, exceeding $25 billion by end-June 2015, which is equivalent to&#13;
                          over six months of imports.&#13;
&#13;
 Monetary                 Headline inflation has evolved along the projected path, banks have started reducing&#13;
 management on            their lending rates, the nominal exchange rate has been stable and reserve build up&#13;
 course.                  has continued. These show that the monetary policy stance pursued by the&#13;
                          Bangladesh Bank in recent years has indeed worked in achieving its broad&#13;
                          objectives. Broad money growth in FY15 languished below the Monetary Policy&#13;
                          Statement (MPS) target primarily because of shortfall in domestic credit growth,&#13;
                          reflecting weak demand for credit both from the private sector and the central&#13;
                          government.&#13;
&#13;
                          With the 7th Five Year Plan proposing to stay on a disinflationary path (reducing&#13;
                          inflation to 5.5 percent by FY20), the appropriate stance is to continue what has&#13;
                          generally worked. Bangladesh Bank has to be credited for adhering to the ongoing&#13;
                          stance with relatively minor adjustments despite pressures for switching to an&#13;
                          expansionary policy.&#13;
&#13;
 The banking sector       The extent of improvements in the industry dynamics fell well short of expectations.&#13;
 remains challenged.      Average earnings are estimated to have declined by 7 percent in FY15, compared&#13;
                          with 7.5 percent growth last year. Slower credit growth over the last 4 years has also&#13;
                          brought to the fore the accumulated effects of substandard credit practices and&#13;
                          governance issues. State-owned banksâ&#128;&#153; performance was much worse than the&#13;
                          private commercial banks (PCBs), attributable to the poor quality of the board and&#13;
                          management. A number of big financial scams led to a general erosion of investorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
                          confidence in banking stocks. The credit and risk management status in the&#13;
                          banking sector remains unsatisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
 Fiscal policy            Overall, the fiscal deficit in FY15 was contained at 3.6 percent of GDP despite&#13;
 plagued by revenue       underperformance in tax collections due to political disruptions and a shift in the&#13;
 collection and           composition of imports towards low duty commodities. While the fuel subsidy has&#13;
 development budget       declined, there has been little visible improvement in the quality of Annual&#13;
 implementation           Development Program (ADP) implementation. Yet the planned size of ADP in&#13;
 shortfall.               FY16 is envisaged to increase by 29 percent relative to the FY15 revised ADP. The&#13;
                          share of domestic financing of budget deficit increased from 1.1 percent of GDP in&#13;
&#13;
October 2015                                                                      THE WORLD BANK&#13;
                                                                                                ii&#13;
&amp;#12; Bangladesh Development Update                                                        On a stable path&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        FY14 to 1.4 percent in FY15, driven by increase in non-bank borrowing which&#13;
                        exceeded the original budget target by 93 percent. Due to a shift in the composition&#13;
                        of domestic finance from low to high interest cost sources in recent years, interest&#13;
                        costs (Tk. 351 billion) are beginning to dwarf spending on many sectors critical for&#13;
                        development (health Tk. 125 billion, primary education Tk. 145 billion, fuel and&#13;
                        energy Tk. 185.4 billion). However, public debt as a share of GDP has remained on&#13;
                        a downward path.&#13;
&#13;
The overall pace of     While the sixth and seventh review of the IMFâ&#128;&#153;s Extended Credit Facility (ECF)&#13;
structural reforms is   arrangement had to be deferred due to delays in completion of some prior actions&#13;
slow and there have     related to the VAT law implementation and amendment as well as external audit of&#13;
been delays in          the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), the pace of structural reforms has&#13;
implementing            remained slow. Impressive progress has been made in implementing various&#13;
reforms under the       activities of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) Action Plan. However,&#13;
IMF program.            a number of actions remain only partly completed. As a result, the US did not&#13;

                        non-trivial. Crude prices have recently been volatile and geo-political risks are ever&#13;
                        present. Non-food inflation has risen in the first half of 2015. With the 7th Five Year&#13;

                        FY20), in the absence of sustained structural reforms, the appropriate&#13;
                        macroeconomic stance is to err on the side of caution.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Poverty reduction and growth have been robust to political turmoil, policy uncertainty, infrastructure deficit, and high cost of doing&#13;
business. Sustainability of growth is the major issue given the lack of appetite for reforms and lackluster progress in the&#13;
implementation of transformative public investment projects. Favorable international prices and prudent demand management&#13;
has helped reduce inflation. A sustained but declining balance of payment surplus led to further reserve accumulation to prevent&#13;
nominal appreciation. The financial sectorâ&#128;&#153;s exposure to risk remains disconcerting. The fiscal deficit has been contained despite&#13;
revenue shortfall and public debt is at a low risk of distress.&#13;

  Box 1: Disconnect Between Outcome and Proxy Indicators&#13;
   The rise in growth in FY15 is hard to reconcile with some key proxy indicators of growth. The proxy indicators on&#13;
   private investment are at odds with the FY15 estimated investment outcomes. The growth of credit to the private&#13;
   sector was only 13.2 percent in FY15. Total investment in export processing zones (EPZs) achieved a growth rate of&#13;
   13.1 percent (worth US$ 3.4 billion) in July-April of FY15 over the corresponding period of FY14, compared with 14.5&#13;
   percent in FY14 and 31.5 percent in FY13. Growth of payments against capital machinery import was 23 percent&#13;
   during the first nine months of FY15. However, the Center for Policy Dialogue (CPD) identified 30 import items (at&#13;
   HS 8-digit level), whose assessable value is more than Tk. 100 crore, which achieved over 100 percent growth during&#13;
   the period.2 More precisely, some of the items (airplanes and other aircraft, compression ignition, internal combustion&#13;
   piston engines, machines for treating metal including electric wire, and transformers) show very high growth in their&#13;
   value largely reflecting high growth in their prices during July-March of FY15. This is abnormal within the period of a&#13;
   year when most other items show either lower or negative growth.&#13;
&#13;
   Real private investment grew by 8.7 percent in FY15, according to BBS. This is hard to back up with evidence&#13;
   showing any significant shift in investor confidence. In fact, a recent rapid business environment assessment survey,&#13;
   conducted by the CPD, found that a significant 62.5 percent of large entrepreneurs in Bangladesh generally agreed that&#13;
   money laundering was taking place through the formal banking system quite extensively. The survey also indicated a&#13;

   environment could deteriorate further in the near term. The major impediments towards private investments include:&#13;
   corruption, inadequate infrastructure, inefficient government bureaucracy, government instability and limited access to&#13;
   financing. Most of the respondents were rather pessimistic about the ongoing initiatives to improve infrastructure (67.8&#13;
   percent) and their prospects of timely completion (76.7 percent).&#13;

                      China, India, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand (Table-3). The drastic fall&#13;
                      in export performance reflected the impact of a violent and uncertain political&#13;
                      environment, uneven developments in major export destinations, falling global&#13;
                      commodity prices and the volatile exchange rate of the Euro.3 The growth rate of&#13;
                      exports in the EU did slightly less badly than the US market, but both declined&#13;
                      significantly relative to the previous year. Little progress was made in product and&#13;
                      market diversification since export performance in non-traditional markets and&#13;
                      export of non-RMG products did not show much improvements (just 0.2 percent&#13;
                      growth in FY15 compared with 3.5 percent in FY14). In both the US and EU&#13;
                      markets, several of Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s export competitors of RMG products performed&#13;
                      considerably better than Bangladesh. RMG exports from Pakistan, Vietnam and&#13;
                      Cambodia to the EU market and from Vietnam, India, Honduras and Sri Lanka to&#13;
                      the US market increased at much faster rates. This suggests external factors cannot&#13;
                      solely account for the export growth slowdown.&#13;
&#13;
 Preference erosion   Bangladeshi RMG exports are facing fierce competition in both the US and EU&#13;
 could worsen.        markets with competitors that have received or may receive preferential treatment.&#13;
                      Pakistan has emerged as a strong competitor in the EU market since it gained the&#13;
                      EUâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#152;GSP Plusâ&#128;&#153; facility. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has just been&#13;
                      concluded. It is likely to induce further preference erosion for Bangladeshi RMG&#13;
                      products in the US market vis-Ã -vis those from developing countries, such as&#13;
                      Vietnam, in the medium term. Bangladesh may need to focus more on the EU&#13;
                      market, which does not impose duty on Bangladeshi exports and has a more flexible&#13;
                      rules of origin requirement.&#13;
&#13;
                      Bangladeshi policymakers should continue negotiations with their US counterparts&#13;
                      for restoration of GSP and more favorable market access for RMG products. Such&#13;
                      access will necessitate faster implementation of labor standard-related commitments&#13;
                      on Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s part (Box-2). Bangladeshi exporters of RMG products need to&#13;
                      attain fully compliant status as soon as possible through the ongoing Accord and&#13;
                      Alliance initiatives. This can provide an edge in terms of competitiveness since&#13;
                      buyers are more comfortable sourcing products from countries that have formal full&#13;
                      compliance status.&#13;

  Box 2: Progress on Garment Industry Compliance Reforms&#13;
  Itâ&#128;&#153;s been two years since the Rana Plaza tragedy. Although much remains to be done to ensure the rights and safety of&#13;
  workers in Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s garment industry, progress has been made. The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in&#13;
  Bangladesh in May 2015 reported an acceleration in the pace of improvement in working conditions in garments. The&#13;
  percentage of all identified issues has increased to 31 percent from 22 percent in the previous report. More than 1000&#13;
  Corrective Action Plans have been developed. The Accord verified the first 2 fully remediated factories where all&#13;
  safety corrections from the initial inspections were completed. There remain concerns about remediation delays in&#13;
  many inspected factories. There has also been progress in the implementation of the National Tripartite Action Plan&#13;
  for Building and Fire Safety and Alliance for Bangladesh Workers Safety. Table-4 summarizes progress on assessment:&#13;

  A total of 98 factories were referred to Review Panel, out of which 32 factories were closed, 27 factories were partially&#13;
  closed and 39 have been allowed to operate.&#13;
&#13;
  The ILO and other NGOs are reportedly pleased with the progress made on worker safety, but worker rights issues&#13;
  have lagged behind other improvements. At the end of 2012, there were 122 unions in Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s garment industry&#13;
  representing less than 3 percent of workers. The Rana Plaza collapse spurred an increase in both the number of unions&#13;
  and the number of workers joining them, resulting in a more than 20 percent increase in factory-level unions in the&#13;
  garment industry. The number of unions now stand at 437, representing nearly 5 percent of workers in the industry.&#13;
  The government has made the process of starting and registering a union easier and more transparent. This has helped&#13;
  spur their adoption, although there remains a lack of trust between companies and unions.&#13;
&#13;
  Part of the remedial plans that came out of talks immediately following the Rana Plaza collapse was the need to&#13;
  establish worker safety committees at the cityâ&#128;&#153;s factories, so that employees would have a place to voice concerns about&#13;
  workplace safety. So far, those committees have not been formed because the government has been slow to draft&#13;
  policies for their creation.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                       the same period. Core inflation that only counts non-food and non-fuel inflation is&#13;
                       on the rise.5&#13;
&#13;
Non-food inflation         A decomposition of non-food inflation shows that average inflation has been&#13;
increase was               consistently increasing in medical care and transport, which led to an overall&#13;
narrowly based.            increase in non-food inflation. The declining trend in food inflation in recent&#13;
                           months can be largely explained by lower prices of rice at the retail level. The&#13;
                           global prices of almost all commodities, including food and fuel, declined sharply&#13;
                           throughout FY15. Most commodity prices declined due to ample supplies and&#13;
                           weak demand in international markets.&#13;
&#13;
The transmission of    Administered petroleum prices have not been adjusted at all despite more than 60&#13;
international price    percent decline in crude oil prices in the last year and a half. Even in cases of&#13;
changes to domestic    market determined domestic prices, the long run response to international price&#13;
prices is uneven.      changes is muted (see analysis in Section-V). The domestic price response to&#13;
                       international price increases and price decreases is not symmetric. There is some&#13;
                       downward inflexibility in domestic nominal price adjustments.&#13;
&#13;
A cautious stance      For the first time in FY15, year-on-year inflation stayed below 7 percent since July&#13;
on demand              2014 as did the twelve-monthly-moving average since November 2014. Food&#13;
management is still    inflation suffered setback in the first quarter of 2015 as the food supply chain was&#13;
warranted.             severely disrupted due to nation-wide and regional strikes (hartals) and blockades.&#13;
                       Non-food inflation was more resilient in the face of suppressed domestic demand&#13;
                       due to consumersâ&#128;&#153; inability to go out and spend. With stability since March 2015, a&#13;
                       gradual rise in domestic demand is natural as suppressed demand translated into&#13;
                       actual. This coupled with the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 6.2 percent target for FY16 implies that&#13;
                       the policy brakes on the price level cannot be eased any time soon.&#13;

Poverty reduction is   Poverty headcount based on US$ 1.25 per day PPP is projected to have declined&#13;
likely to have         from 43.5 percent in 2010 to 38.4 percent in 2015. This steady reduction is mainly&#13;
continued at its       attributable to improvements in the farm income of rural households. Indeed, the&#13;
historic pace          main contributor to poverty reduction between 2005 and 2010 was labor income,&#13;
consistent with the    largely driven by increases in farm income. World Food Programâ&#128;&#153;s wage data&#13;
observed stable        suggests that agricultural daily workersâ&#128;&#153; terms-of-trade in some high poverty&#13;
growth.                divisions like Barisal, Khulna, and Rajshahi improved substantially in the first&#13;
                       quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in FY14. In addition, the estimated&#13;
                       patterns in poverty reduction are reinforced by the decline in food price inflation&#13;
                       from 8.6 percent in FY14 to 6.7 percent in FY15.&#13;
&#13;
Measures of            Consumption inequality was estimated at 31 percent and 30 percent (Gini) in 2005&#13;
consumption            and 2010, respectively. Growth incidence curves in 2005-2010 reveal that&#13;
inequality such as     consumption growth was pro-poor â&#128;&#147; poorer households benefited from a larger rise&#13;
the Gini index are     in per capita consumption than those at the top of the distribution. The per capita&#13;
low and very stable.   consumption of the bottom 40 percent is likely to have continued to increase&#13;
                       responding to the increase in rural wages, expansion in agricultural output, and&#13;
                       reduction in food prices. Yet, differences in agricultural wages of male and female&#13;
                       agricultural workers remain very high. During the high agricultural season in FY15,&#13;
                       the average wage for female workers in the divisions of Barisal, Khulna, and&#13;
                       Rajshahi was only 197 Taka/day compared to 295 Taka/day for male workers.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                          Exchange Rate (REER) index of the Taka shows that the currency has been&#13;
                          appreciating for the last three years, while the nominal exchange rate has mostly&#13;
                          remained stable against the US$. In the 12 months ending August 2015, the REER&#13;
                          appreciated by 14.4 percent (Figure-6 on REER) due to higher domestic inflation&#13;
                          relative to inflation in trading partner countries and appreciation of taka against the&#13;
                          currencies of the same countries (Table-5). Bangladesh Bank continued to intervene&#13;
                          on the buying side to prevent taka appreciation against US$ leading to further&#13;
                          accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. The difference between the Real&#13;
                          Effective Exchange Rate based nominal rate and the inter-bank rate has widened in&#13;
                          recent weeks, indicating that the nominal exchange rate competitiveness gap is&#13;
                          widening. BBâ&#128;&#153;s interventions in the foreign exchange market have limited the loss&#13;
                          of external competitiveness by stemming any further nominal appreciation of the&#13;
                          taka against the US$.&#13;

                     3. Monetary Management and Financial Developments&#13;
&#13;
Monetary                  BB succeeded in keeping the FY15 broad money and reserve money growth in line&#13;
management on             with the target rates. Broad money growth slowed to 12.4â&#128;&#148;the lowest in the&#13;
course.                   current decade--while reserve money growth slowed to 14.3 percent over its stock at&#13;
                          end-June 2014. BB had to contain growth of net domestic assets to counter the&#13;
                          overshooting of target for net foreign asset growth. Private sector credit growth&#13;
                          remained subdued at 13.2 percent (Figure-7). This contributed to undershooting the&#13;
                          monetary growth target. Policy rates were not changed despite pressures from&#13;
                          stakeholders. With ample liquidity created by BB purchase of foreign exchange,&#13;
                          sterilization operations had to be continued, which adversely affected BB&#13;
                          profitability. BB conducted Treasury bill auctions regularly. With excess liquidity,&#13;
                          the T-bills were in high demand, which resulted in declining interest rates on&#13;
                          instruments of all maturities as well as bank deposits and advances (Figure-8):&#13;
&#13;
                          ï&#130;·    The weighted average yield on 91 day T-bills declined by 1.4 percentage points&#13;
                               and on 364 days T-bills declined by 1.36 percentage points in FY15.&#13;
                          ï&#130;·    The call money rate eased to 5.63 percent in August 2015 compared with 6.52&#13;
                               percent in August 2014.&#13;
                          ï&#130;·    The average deposit rate declined from 7.79 percent in June 2014 to 6.8 percent&#13;
                               in June 2015 and average rate on bank advances declined from 13.1 percent to&#13;
                               11.67 percent during the same period.&#13;

                      The Bangladesh Bank has taken some significant initiatives in recent years to widen&#13;
                      financial inclusion. These include changing of urban: rural branch opening rules&#13;
                      from 5:1 to 1:1, requiring banks to allow farmers to open bank accounts with&#13;
                      minimum Tk. 10 initial deposit; issuing branch licenses to all SME/Agricultural&#13;
                      service centers, mandatory participation in agriculture/rural credit for all banks&#13;
                      including private and foreign, provision of agricultural credit to sharecroppers,&#13;
                      refinancing schemes for women entrepreneurs and so on. Expansion of mobile&#13;
                      financial services have also widened financial inclusion.9&#13;

                        disrupted implementation progress. Given the low level of private investment and&#13;
                        significant infrastructure deficit, better quality and timely implementation of the&#13;

&#13;
 Implementation is      The overall FY16 budget deficit target is manageable (5 percent of GDP),&#13;
 the main challenge     notwithstanding highly ambitious revenue targets. Revenue-GDP ratio is projected&#13;
 in the FY16 budget.    to increase by 1.5 percentage point. This is not beyond the realm of possibility since&#13;
                        such an increase was achieved in FY08, but it has been rather rare. The expenditure-&#13;
                        GDP ratio is projected to increase by about 3 percentage pointsâ&#128;&#148;well above the 0.8&#13;
                        percentage point annual increase achieved on average in last five years. Increase in&#13;
                        public sector wages and transfer payments account for 47 percent of the planned&#13;
                        increase in the expenditure-GDP ratio in FY16. Increase in the size of ADP&#13;
                        accounts for the rest. The size of ADP in FY16 is envisaged to increase by 29.3&#13;

                        implementation is difficult when the number of projects remain unmanageably&#13;
                        large.. Usual problems of too many projects with too little allocation have not been&#13;
                        addressed.&#13;

 Subsidies expected     Expenditure on subsidies in FY16 are projected to decline to 157.7 billion taka&#13;
 to fall further.       (slightly over $2 billion), compared with Tk. 230 billion (about $2.9 billion) in FY15.&#13;
                        Recent upward adjustments in gas and electricity prices will certainly help this cause.&#13;

be needed to go         Tk. 2 trillion (about $26.7 billion), which is 27.6 percent higher than the FY15&#13;
beyond the cyclical     revised budget. The FY16 budget introduced some revenue reforms. These include&#13;
recovery in revenue     increasing the personal income tax threshold by Tk. 50,000. The tax exemption limit&#13;
in FY16.                for women, senior citizens and handicapped people also increased by Tk. 25,000.&#13;
                        Net wealth exemption limit has been increased from Tk. 20 million to Tk. 22.5&#13;
                        million with wealth surcharge reduced from 30 percent to 25 percent. Corporate tax&#13;
                        for publicly traded companies has been reduced from 27.5 percent to 25 percent.&#13;
                        New revenue generation measures include advance income tax of 0.6 percent on all&#13;
                        exports, supplementary duty of 3 percent on services provided through mobile SIM&#13;

                        13.1 percent to 11.4 percent in May 2015. At present, the highest and lowest interest&#13;
                        rate among the national savings certificate are 11.8 and 11 percent respectively. High&#13;
                        interest rate on all government savings certificates compared to deposit rates offered&#13;
                        by the commercial banks led to an increase in sales of these certificates, resulting in&#13;
                        high government borrowing well above the budget target for FY15 and hence this&#13;
                        decrease. However, even after the reduction, interest rates on government saving&#13;
                        certificates remain well above the deposit rates of the commercial banks.&#13;

                  without prior approval of the central bank. The ERQ for export of high domestic&#13;
                  value added merchandise, merchandise with high import content, and services has&#13;
                  been increased to 60 percent, 15 percent, and 60 percent from the previous 50&#13;
                  percent, 10 percent and 50 percent respectively.&#13;

                  any foreign loan to be taken by a local firm following the approval of the&#13;
                  Board of Investment (BoI). Foreign loans to be approved by the BoI no longer&#13;
                  require approval from BB for providing the guarantees like corporate guarantee,&#13;
                  personal guarantee, and third party guarantee to the lending agency against their&#13;

                  In the Agriculture and Rural Credit Policy FY16, Bangladesh Bank (BB) has&#13;
                  increased the farm loan disbursement target by 5.5 percent to Tk. 164 billion.&#13;
                  All banks have to disburse 2.5 percent of their loan portfolio to the farm and rural&#13;
                  sector, and at the end of fiscal year the undisbursed amounts will have to be&#13;
                  deposited to BBâ&#128;&#153;s block accounts without any interest. To meet its target, BB has&#13;
                  incorporated some new issues and strategies which include expanding the coverage&#13;
                  of farm and rural credits, taking strategic steps to spread out rural banking, bringing&#13;
                  farmers under the institutional financial services, encouraging production of export-&#13;
                  substitute crops and emphasizing development of fisheries and livestock.&#13;

                  ensure more transparency and accountability in financial reporting activities.&#13;
                  A separate regulatory body "Financial Reporting Council (FRC)" will be formed to&#13;
                  regulate the country's financial reporting activities. The council will monitor the&#13;
                  function of auditors, and ensure transparency and accountability in accounting and&#13;
                  auditing of financial organizations, including various governments, autonomous and&#13;
                  non-government institutions.&#13;
&#13;
                  The Cabinet has approved 'Foreign Exchange Regulation (Amendment) Act,&#13;
                  2015'. The amendment updates the existing law on regulating the purchase and&#13;
                  selling of foreign currencies and securities. This will help the authorities track any&#13;
                  local or foreign resident to come up with information about their foreign exchange&#13;
                  or securities and immoveable or other properties abroad.&#13;
&#13;
                  The Cabinet has approved amendment to â&#128;&#156;The Money Laundering&#13;
                  Prevention Act 2015â&#128;&#157;. According to this amendment, Bangladesh Bankâ&#128;&#153;s financial&#13;
                  intelligence unit (FIU) will autonomously deal with money laundering. The police&#13;

                  will investigate narcotics cases, the NBR will investigate custom related cases, and&#13;
                  the Anti-Corruption Commission will investigate the bribes and corruption. Murder&#13;
                  motivated by money will be investigated by joint investigation team. The law&#13;
                  provides imprisonment between four to twelve year and Tk. 2 million fine if&#13;
                  convicted.&#13;

&#13;
               NBR has re-imposed 5 percent advance income tax on coal import. NBR has&#13;
               taken this decision to beef up the effort for achieving the FY16 revenue with&#13;
               relaxation of restrictions on coal-export by India. Bangladesh will import 1.6&#13;
               million tonnes from India against 4 million tonnes of domestic demand.&#13;
&#13;
               The Government has given in principle approval to the National Social&#13;
               Security Strategy (NSSS). The strategy plans to cover 35.7 million people under&#13;
               the safety nets and bring all the social safety net programs under one umbrella to&#13;
               reduce leakage. The strategy is envisaged to be implemented under five clusters&#13;
               which are: i) children's program (for those below the age of 4) covering 7.5 million&#13;
               beneficiaries; ii) program for school-age children covering 17.9 million children; iii)&#13;
               program for working-age population covering 3.2 million beneficiaries; iv)&#13;
               comprehensive pension scheme for the elderly covering 5.5 million; and v) program&#13;
               for people with disability covering 1 million disabled people. There will also be&#13;
               some special programs to combat problems like vulnerabilities to climate change,&#13;
               environmental degradation and disaster preparedness. The NSSS is envisaged to be&#13;
               implemented in three phases: initial consolidation and coordination (2014-2020);&#13;
               coordination and implementation (2021-2025); and implementation of lifecycle&#13;
               program approach (2026-onwards).&#13;
&#13;
               Government has approved the new pay scale for government servants.&#13;
               According to the new pay scale, the basic salary for civil servants almost doubled.&#13;
               Among 20 grades, the lowest grade salary is increased by 101 percent to Tk. 8,250&#13;
               per month and the highest grade salary is increased by 95 percent to Tk. 78,000. The&#13;
               Cabinet Secretary and those in equivalent posts will get Tk. 86,000 and a Senior&#13;
               Secretary Tk. 82,000. Increased salary will be effective from July 2015, so&#13;
               government employees will get their outstanding salary under new pay scale. In this&#13;
               pay scale also provides for average 5 percent annual increments on basic pay and a&#13;
               20 percent (on basic pay) festival bonus for Bangla New Year. The yearly&#13;
               increments will be 5 percent for the 6th to the 20th grade, 4.5 percent for the 5th&#13;
               grade, 4 percent for the 3rd and 4th grades, and 3.75 percent for the second grade.&#13;
               Pension for government employees will be increased to 90 percent from 80 percent&#13;
               for the 1st and 2nd grades. To implement this new pay scale, government has to&#13;
               spend an additional Tk. 159.04 billion in this fiscal year and Tk. 238.28 billion for&#13;
               next fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
               The Cabinet approved the â&#128;&#152;Civil Service Act, 2015â&#128;&#153; with the provision of a&#13;
               permanent pay commission and administrative reforms. According to the act,&#13;
               government authorization will be required before a charge sheet is accepted against&#13;
               any public servant. However, there will be no bar for arresting, if the charge sheet is&#13;
               accepted by the court, and the agency like Anti-Corruption Commission wants to&#13;
               investigate allegations of criminal offence and file charge sheet against any public&#13;
               servant. Moreover, 10 different issues of public servants such as appointment,&#13;
               promotion, seniority, leave, posting, deputation and lien, conduct and discipline,&#13;
               retirement benefits, resignation and retirement will be framed for making the law&#13;
               operational. In addition, there will be separate framework for career and skills&#13;
               development, welfare and preservation of quota for disabled persons and backward&#13;
               communities.&#13;
&#13;
               The cabinet has given final approval of â&#128;&#156;Nuclear Power Plant Ordinance&#13;
               2015â&#128;&#157;. In the proposed law, a public limited company, Nuclear Power Plant&#13;

&amp;#12;   On a stable path                                                 Bangladesh Development Update&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             Commission (BAEC) will be formed to ensure the development and commercial&#13;
                             operation of nuclear power plants including Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant.&#13;
                             Bangladesh plans to produce 1,000 MW of electricity by 2021 and another 1,000&#13;
                             MW by 2022 from the Rooppur plant. The plant is planned to go into operation by&#13;
                             2021 involving Tk. 50.88 billion, including project aid of Tk. 40 billion from the&#13;
                             Russian government.&#13;
&#13;
                             The Public Private Partnership (PPP) Bill 2015 has been approved by the&#13;
                             parliament. Billâ&#128;&#153;s main aim is to attract more foreign and private investment in&#13;
                             infrastructure and service-oriented sector. Apart from the Annual Development&#13;
                             Programs, the PPP Office will have authority to draw any project. Currently, 42&#13;
                             projects are in various stages of implementation under the PPP where 16 projects&#13;
                             are for transport, 8 projects for economic zone, 6 projects for health, 5 projects for&#13;
                             civil accommodation, 4 projects for tourism, 2 projects for education, and 1 project&#13;
                             is for energy. Under this act, the government will set up Public Private Partnership&#13;
                             Kartripakkha board and the Prime Minister will be the chair of the board of&#13;
                             governors while Finance Minister will be vice-chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                             The government has increased power and natural gas tariffs. The average&#13;
                             electricity price was increased by 2.93 percent to Tk 6.33 per unit (1 kilowatt-hour)&#13;
                             against the previous tariff of Tk 6.15 per unit. The power tariffs for irrigation and&#13;
                             consumers use up to 50 units remain unchanged at Tk 3.33 per unit. Electricity&#13;
                             prices adjust according to consumption level (Table-7). For household gas users,&#13;
                             the tariff for a single-burner stove has been increased to Tk 600 a month from Tk&#13;
                             400, while for a double-burner stove the tariff has been raised to Tk 650 from Tk&#13;
                             450. As per the new gas tariff, the power plants and fertilizer factories, which&#13;
                             consume around 46 per cent of the country's overall natural gas production, are&#13;
                             exempted from the increase (Table 8). This is hard to understand when fertilizer can&#13;
                             be imported at currently low international prices, which would free up gas for power&#13;
                             production and other priority industrial uses.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                              productivity, quality improvement of goods, the export oriented industries will be&#13;
                              given priority in getting power, gas, and other utility services. Sugar and hilsa are&#13;
                              also included as exportable goods but a prior approval of commerce ministry will be&#13;
                              needed.&#13;
&#13;
                              Bangladesh and India signed 22 deals and MoUs, mostly related to trade and&#13;
                              deepening regional connectivity. The agreements include renewal of bilateral&#13;
                              trade deal including a provision of doing business with third countries using rail,&#13;
                              road or waterways of each country, agreement between standard testing institutes,&#13;
                              on coastal shipping and establishment of new border haat (markets). These&#13;
                              agreements can increase bilateral trade, make it smoother and add new dimension to&#13;
                              traditional economic ties. In order to enhance regional connectivity, MoUs were&#13;
                              signed in the area of allowing India to use Chittagong and Mongla port and a new&#13;
                              US$ 2 billion credit line for development of relevant infrastructure. MoUs to&#13;

                              investment in Bangladesh. Following these deals, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and&#13;
                              Nepal signed an agreement and mapped out an action plan to establish economic&#13;
                              corridors for seamless movement of passenger and cargo vehicles across their&#13;
                              territories.&#13;
&#13;
                         6. Outlook&#13;
&#13;
The near term growth and inflation outlook is contingent on global commodity and labor market conditions, given Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
strategic dependence on external trade and remittances. With continued political stability and sound macroeconomic balances,&#13;
Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s economy is projected to stay on the recent growth path, driven by recovery in exports and private investment growth.&#13;
Macroeconomic management will be challenged by overheating resulting from a positive output gap.&#13;

 Projected growth in          Growth is now projected to pick up gradually from 1.8 percent in 2014 to 2.1&#13;
 advanced                     percent in 2015 and 2.4 percent in 2016. 11 The lionâ&#128;&#153;s share of the downward&#13;
 economies,                   revision in advanced economies is accounted for by the unexpected weakness in&#13;
 Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s main            North America. The underlying drivers for acceleration in consumption and&#13;
 export markets, has          investment in the United Statesâ&#128;&#148;wage growth, labor market conditions, easy&#13;

 The good news for            There appears to be a generally robust recovery in domestic demand and inflation is&#13;
 Bangladesh is that           beginning to increase in the euro area. Growth projections have been revised&#13;
 economic recovery            upward for many euro area economies except in Greece. In Japan, growth in the&#13;
 in the euro area             first quarter of 2015 was stronger than expected, supported by a pickup in capital&#13;
 appears broadly on           investment. However, consumption remains sluggish and more than half of&#13;
 track.                       quarterly growth stemmed from changes in inventories. With weaker underlying&#13;
                              momentum in real wages and consumption, the pickup in growth in 2015 is now&#13;
                              projected to be more modest. Growth in emerging market and developing&#13;
                              economies is projected to slow from 4.6 percent in 2014 to 4.2 percent in 2015. The&#13;
                              slowdown reflects the dampening impact of lower commodity prices and tighter&#13;
                              external financial conditions. In 2016, growth in emerging market and developing&#13;
                              economies is expected to pick up to 4.7 percent, largely on account of the projected&#13;
                              improvement in economic conditions in Russia and some economies in the Middle&#13;
                              East.&#13;

&#13;
 The near term                Bangladesh is not at significant risk from contagion related to recent turmoil in&#13;
 political outlook in         international financial markets or slower growth in China. Growth in FY16 is&#13;
 Bangladesh is stable         projected at 6.5 percent, driven by stronger consumption and export growth.&#13;
 as is the outlook for        Bangladesh is reasonably well insulated from the current slow-down in growth in&#13;
 international                China. Around 2.3 percent of exports go to China and financial flow from portfolio&#13;
 commodity prices.            investments have been positive in recent months.&#13;

 The FY16 budget              Achieving this will require the total investment to GDP ratio to rise by over 2&#13;

 7 percent growth             This cannot happen without a major rise in the private investment rate and ensuring&#13;
 target.                      that these investments translate, over time, into increased growth. Export and&#13;
                              private consumption growth can contribute to increased capacity utilization, but the&#13;
                              potential is limited. Exports started badly in July but recovered to reach 4.5 percent&#13;
                              cumulative growth in July-August relative to the same period the previous year.&#13;
                              Import of capital machinery increased by 58.7 percent in July 2015 relative to the&#13;
                              same month the previous year. Remittances on the other hand declined by 3.3&#13;
                              percent in the same period. Bangladeshi manufacturing firms report very high levels&#13;
                              of capacity utilization already. Inflation declined to 6.2 percent in August 2015,&#13;
                              reflecting primarily a decline in non-food inflation. But core inflation is high, rising&#13;
                              from 6.08 percent in January to 6.74 percent in June 2015.12&#13;

 Term                         percent during FY16 will be challenging if the structural reforms in infrastructure&#13;
 Macroeconomic                management and business regulation are not implemented. The risks of inflation&#13;
 Framework                    remain non-trivial. Crude prices have recently been volatile and geo-political risks&#13;
 presented with the           are ever present. Non-food inflation has risen in the first half of 2015. With the 7th&#13;
 FY16 budget is               Five Year Plan proposing to stay on a disinflationary path (reducing inflation to 5.5&#13;
 relatively realistic.        percent by FY20), the appropriate macroeconomic stance is to err on the side of&#13;
                              caution. All evidence suggests that Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s potential GDP growth rate is no&#13;
                              more than 6.5 percent given its demographics, feeble state of physical infrastructure,&#13;
                              and lingering political uncertainties. Macroeconomic management will have to&#13;
                              include strong surveillance of the economyâ&#128;&#153;s proclivity to overheat if growth&#13;
                              diverges above the potential rate and adjust the policy instruments accordingly.&#13;

*Preliminary estimation from BBS data&#13;
Fiscal and monetary          The monetary program envisages accommodating the central government bank&#13;
policy makers have           borrowing target in the FY16 budget without monetizing it. The budget deficit may&#13;
resisted pressures           rise in FY16, but the debt level continues to remain at a low risk of distress. Central&#13;
for switching to an          government bank borrowing requirements may exceed the budget target due to&#13;
expansionary stance          likely shortfall in revenue collection, aid disbursement, and non-bank borrowing&#13;
and distortionary            targets.&#13;
exchange rate&#13;
policy.&#13;
&#13;
                             With persistent current account deficit, the surplus in the overall balance of&#13;
                             payments is likely to shrink leading to slower accumulation of net foreign assets.&#13;
                             This will create space for domestic credit growth without overshooting the broad&#13;
                             money growth target which is rightly limited to 15.6 percent, about 2 percent higher&#13;
                             than the 13.6 percent nominal GDP growth. Various business and trade&#13;
                             associations have been calling for discriminatory exchange rate for exports, imports&#13;
                             and remittances to offset the loss of competitiveness due to real appreciation of the&#13;
                             taka. BB has rightly not heeded these calls and must continue to do so. The BOP&#13;
                             surplus may erode with widening of current account deficit and shrinkage of&#13;
                             financial account surplus as aid disbursement and FDI weaken while repayment on&#13;
                             account recent private sector foreign borrowing rise.&#13;

The FY16 budget is           It has increased public pay and allowances by 57.3% and promised to complete a&#13;
expected to boost            number of large ongoing investment projects this year. In education, health and&#13;
growth directly              social protection, there is decline in the level of spending relative to the total size of&#13;
through                      the FY16 budget, which does not bode well for human development and might&#13;
consumption and              slow the pace of poverty reduction. However, the budget is expected to contribute&#13;
indirectly by                to reducing income inequalities by continuing to reduce the share of indirect taxes&#13;
facilitating exports         from 63.9 percent of total revenue in FY15 to 63.2 percent in FY16. The direct&#13;
and private                  taxation system has a progressive rate structure in Bangladesh while the indirect&#13;
investment.                  taxes are regressive.&#13;

Expenditure Review           resources make efficient public expenditure especially important. The PER update13&#13;
(PER) update noted           found several areas where this efficiency could be improved. Findings that merit&#13;
that Bangladesh has          particular attention include: (i) a quarter of recurrent expenditures toward interest&#13;
among the worldâ&#128;&#153;s            costs, which dwarf spending on key social sectors such as health and social welfare,&#13;
lowest public sector         partly as a result of high-cost financing instruments; (ii) subsidies have seen steep&#13;
revenues and                 increases over the last decade, particularly toward agriculture but it is not clear that&#13;
expenditures as a            subsidies achieve their aims; (iii) public investment has increased impressively over&#13;
share of GDP.                the last decade but maintenance on the new infrastructure has not kept pace,&#13;
                             remaining flat for a decade; (iv) some positive steps have been taken to reduce&#13;

                             projects added but allocations reduced, and, at the same time, many ADP projects&#13;
                             suffer from cost and time over-runs. These issues are discussed in more depth in&#13;

                         7. Challenges&#13;
&#13;
 Unresolved political uncertainty and prolonged slower growth in advanced and emerging markets can hinder export and private&#13;
 investment recovery while creating pressure on the balance of payments. Persistent dollar strength can further erode the cost&#13;
 advantage in the European market. Banking system solvency may weaken, thus constraining access to finance. Fiscal&#13;
 consolidation efforts could slip. Greater downward flexibility in the exchange rate would need to be combined with some fiscal&#13;
 easing and speedier structural reforms and public investment to sustain growth and poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
 The                          The key challenge on the domestic front continues to be the acceleration of private&#13;
 macroeconomic                investments and better using public sector resources for implementing the&#13;
 outlook presented            important infrastructure projects and social programs. The investment outlook is&#13;
 above has                    clouded by the political uncertainties. Bangladesh has the potential to attract FDI&#13;
 significant                  from a wide range of countries, including relocation away from China that is&#13;
 downside risks               currently underway. If the government fails to provide necessary infrastructure&#13;
 associated with              support in the form of power, and serviced land by establishing SEZs rapidly, and&#13;
 domestic and                 improved transport facilities through better connectivity and ports, much of these&#13;
 external factors.            new opportunities may be lost to the international competitors.&#13;
&#13;
 Supply side                  The inability to realize the 8 percent growth target under the Sixth Five Year Plan&#13;
 constraints remain           was primarily attributable to shortfall in both domestic and foreign private&#13;
 the binding ones.            investment as supply side constraints did not ease. With increase in the size of the&#13;
                              public investment, the quality of spending will become all the more important for&#13;
                              economic efficiency. Overall, the 8 percent growth target by the end of the Seventh&#13;
                              Five Year Plan is attainable, provided necessary supportive reforms and policies are&#13;
                              put in place.&#13;

 External factors will        The pace of recovery of the European Union economies, the primary destination of&#13;
 continue to                  Bangladeshi exports, following the European Debt Crisis will be critical. Further&#13;

 Macroeconomic                Macroeconomic policy space is generally limited in a developing economy like&#13;
 policy space to              Bangladesh. Demand support should come from fiscal policy rebalancing aimed at&#13;

Opportunities for        The current juncture puts a premium on structural reforms that ensure a&#13;
transformative           sustainable adjustment to a new equilibrium of low commodity prices and&#13;
structural reforms       gradually tightening financial conditions. Several large developing countries are&#13;
need to be much          implementing ambitious reform agendas, but Bangladesh is lagging behind.&#13;
better exploited.        Structural reforms are particularly challenging in the following areas:&#13;
&#13;
                         ï&#130;·   Financial. There has been no visible reduction in nonperforming loans as&#13;
                             habitual defaulters continue their delinquent behavior with impunity. Capital&#13;
                             reserves (tier 1) to risk-weighted assets are just 8.2 percent placing banks at&#13;
                             some risk in the event of significant defaults. While the Bangladesh Bank has&#13;
                             taken some steps to improve supervision by deploying digital technology to&#13;
                             investigate big financial transactions, inaction on making the defaulters&#13;
                             accountable has not helped change the game.&#13;
                         ï&#130;·   Energy. The drop in oil prices generated substantial fiscal savings because fuel&#13;
                             prices were heavily subsidized. Bangladesh has not made sufficient use of this&#13;
                             opportunity either to build fiscal space, which would allow an effective&#13;
                             counter-cyclical response in the event of an economic slowdown, or to invest&#13;
                             in infrastructure or human capital.&#13;
                         ï&#130;·   Fiscal. The government is still committed to implement the new VAT law from&#13;
                             July 2016. However, the FY16 budget was short in providing directions on&#13;
                             reforms to improve the effectiveness of public expenditure and revenue&#13;
                             administration. Also, local government finances need to be brought onto a&#13;
                             more sustainable footing, addressing expenditure and revenue mismatches&#13;
                             across different levels of government, and reinforcing local government&#13;
                             revenue capacity including through better property taxation.&#13;
                         ï&#130;·   Administrative. Administrative reforms to streamline court proceedings to&#13;
                             facilitate contract enforcement have generally stagnated. Much of the reform&#13;
                             agenda, including a broad-based reform of state-owned enterprises, remains to&#13;
                             be implemented. Issues that need to be addressed include: implicit and explicit&#13;
                             government guarantees, non-binding budget constraints, low efficiency, and a&#13;
                             lack of transparency and accountability.&#13;

                    on garment exports, thus widening the trade deficit. However, the relatively low-&#13;

                    competitiveness would act as mitigating factors. Persistent dollar strength can&#13;
                    further erode the cost advantage in the European market. Greater downward&#13;
                    flexibility in the US$/Taka exchange rate would need to be combined with fiscal&#13;
                    easing while resisting further nominal exchange rate appreciation against the US$.&#13;

&#13;
                          1. Bangladesh Public Expenditure Review&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank recently completed a Public Expenditure Review Update analyzing the major spending trends in Bangladesh.&#13;
It includes the overall macro-fiscal stance (deficits, debt, etc.) and the allocation of resources within the budget on both a sectoral&#13;
level (health, education, etc.) and a thematic level (wages, interest, etc.). The headline findings are positive, with broadly&#13;
sustainable fiscal deficits and public debt. However, many challenges remain including: (i) boosting revenue, which is among the&#13;
worldâ&#128;&#153;s lowest; (ii) reviewing fiscal risks posed by contingent liabilities, notably in pensions and SOEs; (iii) assessing the efficiency&#13;
and equity of subsidies, which have seen an eightfold increase in the last decade; (iv) reducing interest costs, which have reached a&#13;
quarter of total recurrent spending; (v) improving development expenditure planning and ensuring value-for-money of investment&#13;
projects; and (vi) ensuring sufficient resources are allocated not only to building new infrastructure but also to maintaining existing&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          a. Deficit	and	Debt	&#13;
&#13;
 Bangladesh has a              Over the past decade, Bangladesh achieved an average fiscal deficit of 3.1 percent of&#13;
 good record of low            GDP and, at 3 percent in FY14, the deficit was well below the South Asia average&#13;
 fiscal deficits and           of 3.7 percent. Deficits also varied within a fairly narrow band, ranging from 2.2 to&#13;
 sustainable public            4 percent of GDP. Thanks to contained deficits and strong economic growth,&#13;
 debt.                         public debt declined steadily from 42 percent of GDP in FY06 to 34 percent at the&#13;
                               end of FY14, among the lowest in South Asia (Table-10). The latest Debt&#13;
                               Sustainability Analysis (DSA) found that public debt was sustainable, even in the&#13;
                               event of large shocks, including significant borrowing to finance new power plants&#13;
                               and partially recapitalize state-owned banks.&#13;

  However, several            Demographic trends mean that public sector pensions could begin to pose a risk to&#13;
  risks to fiscal             long-term fiscal sustainability. While some steps forward have been taken to contain&#13;
  sustainability do           spending on the Civil Service Retirement Scheme (CSRS), risks remain. The General&#13;
  exist, many outside         Provident Fund (GPF) has significant unfunded liabilities, pays a high rate of&#13;
  of the control of           interest and allows easy withdrawal of most amounts saved at any time, presenting&#13;
  government.                 particular risks. Contingent liabilities related to state-owned banks carry potential&#13;
                              costs of up to 2.5 percent of GDP, while total guarantees are estimated at around 4&#13;
                              percent of GDP in FY15, including to non-financial SOE. Other vulnerabilities&#13;
                              relate to international fuel prices, as fuel and fertilizer subsidies absorb a significant&#13;
                              proportion of the budget, and currency depreciation. These risks could be&#13;
                              particularly large if several occur together and the government is not able to issue&#13;
                              sufficient debt to cover the payments.&#13;
&#13;
                         b. Revenue	Mobilization	&#13;
&#13;
  Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s                A spurt in revenue growth raised revenue from 9.8 percent of GDP in FY09 to 11.2&#13;
  revenue                     percent in FY12. It since declined somewhat, leaving Bangladesh with among the&#13;
  performance is              lowest revenue to GDP ratio in the world (Figure-14). While tax collections tend to&#13;
  underwhelming.              increase in line with economic growth, Bangladesh has, by and large, found it&#13;
                              challenging to turn economic growth into revenue growth. As a result, tax revenues&#13;
                              (which make up over 80 percent of all revenue) remain below expected for&#13;
                              Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s level of development. Although reliance on border revenue has fallen&#13;
                              since FY10, custom duties, supplementary duties and VAT paid on imports still&#13;
                              made up almost 30 percent of total revenue in FY14.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Bangladesh has              With corporate income tax rates of up to 45 percent, firms face potentially high tax&#13;
among the highest           rates. In addition, the Doing Business 2015 survey estimated that businesses require&#13;
corporate taxes in          302 hours per year to pay their taxes, higher than India (243 hours), Sri Lanka (167)&#13;
the region but also         or Bhutan (274) but fewer than Pakistan (594).15 Tax effort â&#128;&#147; actual revenues&#13;
the lowest â&#128;&#156;tax             compared to potential collections given the countryâ&#128;&#153;s characteristics â&#128;&#147; are the lowest&#13;
effortâ&#128;&#157;.                    in the region, averaging 64 percent over the period 2004-12. This is not surprising in&#13;
                            a country where only around 1 percent of the total population pay regular taxes.&#13;
                            Low collections and low tax effort reflect a need to simplify taxes, reduce the use of&#13;
                            exemptions and improve the tax administration including by enhancing compliance&#13;
                            and reducing corruption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
With low revenues           While the record in fiscal discipline has been commendable, it stems partly from a&#13;
and contained fiscal        lack of capacity among some ministries to spend allocated resources. As well as&#13;
deficits, public            having among the worldâ&#128;&#153;s lowest revenues, Bangladesh has the worldâ&#128;&#153;s lowest&#13;
expenditures are            public expenditures, at around 14 percent of GDP in FY14 world (Figure-15). An&#13;
also low.                   inability to absorb resources among some ministries, particularly in the development&#13;
                            budget, contribute to the low expenditure. With significant development needs,&#13;
                            including infrastructure requirements, and a weighty poverty challenge, public sector&#13;
                            resources must be used efficiently to make progress.&#13;

&#13;
  Low public                   For example, Bangladesh spends less on health care than other countries in South&#13;
  expenditures result          Asia and, indeed, less than most countries in the world. Health expenditure per&#13;
  in some of the               capita was around US$95 in 2013 compared to $215 in India, $126 in Pakistan and&#13;
  regionâ&#128;&#153;s most                $304 in Sri Lanka. Out-of-pocket costs are estimated at close to two thirds of the&#13;
  limited public               total. It is also ranked has having the poorest quality of infrastructure by the World&#13;
  services and poorest         Economic Forum (WEF). The Global Competitiveness Report 2014-15 ranks&#13;
  infrastructure.              Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s overall infrastructure at 130th out of 144 countries, lower than Pakistan&#13;
                               (119th), India (87th) or Sri Lanka (75th). Its road and railway infrastructure perform&#13;
                               particularly poorly.&#13;
&#13;
 Recurrent expenditure makes up majority of public expenditure and total recurrent nearly doubled during the past decade, dominated&#13;
 by interest payments.&#13;
&#13;
  Around two-thirds            Between FY10 and FY14, public expenditure grew by an annual average of around&#13;
  of the budget goes           8 percent. While both recurrent and development expenditure saw significant&#13;
  to recurrent                 increases in real terms, the priority clearly shifted toward investment during the&#13;
  expenditure but              period. Public investment grew at an annual average of 14 percent, while recurrent&#13;
  there has been a             expenditure grew by 6 percent per year. As a result, development increased as a&#13;
  shift toward                 share of total expenditure from 33 to 40 percent.16 Expenditure patterns in both the&#13;
  investment or                recurrent and development budgets are broadly in line with the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
  development over             development plan.&#13;
  the last five years.&#13;
&#13;
  Recurrent                    Recurrent expenditure averaged around 71 percent of total public expenditures&#13;
  expenditure                  between FY06 and FY1417 or 8.7 percent of GDP (Figure-16). It grew on average&#13;
  increased fast over          10 percent per year over the period FY06-11 with non-interest spending driving&#13;
  the last decade and          almost all of this increase. Between FY11 and FY14, total recurrent spending&#13;
  performance falls            growth slowed to 5 percent per year, as investment expenditure became a higher&#13;
  into two distinct            priority. However, non-interest expenditure growth slowed to a trickle â&#128;&#147; less than 3&#13;
  periods driven by            percent â&#128;&#147; while interest costs increased at around 14 percent per year compared to 7&#13;
  interest costs.              percent per year in FY06-FY11. Interest costs increased from a decade low of 1.7&#13;
                               percent of GDP in FY11 to 2.1 percent in FY14 (Figure-17). This is in a context of&#13;
                               a country where revenue rarely reaches 11 percent of GDP. In FY14, 24 percent of&#13;
                               total recurrent expenditure was on interest payments, up from a decade low of 19&#13;
                               percent in FY11. Between FY06 and FY14, interest payment increased faster than&#13;
                               other recurrent expenditures. Over this period, interest payments more than&#13;
                               doubled while other expenditures grew by 77 percent in real terms (Figure-18).&#13;

 their growth slowed                education by around 66 percent. There was a clear re-prioritization toward social&#13;
 after FY11.                        welfare, which more than tripled during the period. However, as with other non-&#13;
                                    interest recurrent expenditure, social sector spending growth slowed considerably&#13;
                                    after FY11, from an annual average of 13 percent before then to just 2 percent&#13;

 Agriculture                        Agriculture expenditure more than tripled during the last decade to reach a fifth of&#13;
 expenditure saw an                 non-interest recurrent expenditure. This was driven primarily by subsidies (including&#13;
 increase and                       fertilizer), which increased eightfold over the period (Figure-20). Between FY07 and&#13;
 evaluating the                     FY08, agricultural subsidies increased from 2 percent of the non-interest recurrent&#13;
 effectiveness of high              budget to 9 percent, or from 0.2 to 0.6 percent of GDP. As a result, the agricultural&#13;
 expenditure in the                 budget increased and two thirds of subsidies are used for agriculture (Figure-21), a&#13;
 area will be                       level that has remained reasonably constant since then. At the same time, subsidies&#13;
 important.                         increased from 22 percent of the total agricultural budget in FY06 to 68 percent by&#13;
                                    FY14. Despite the eightfold increase in spending on agricultural subsidies during the&#13;
                                    last decade, real agricultural output increased by just 35 percent. Evaluating whether&#13;
                                    these subsidies, which are subject to world fuel prices, are achieving their aims will&#13;

Non-interest recurrent expenditure is dominated by remuneration, grants and subsidies, with allowances driving public sector&#13;
remuneration.&#13;
&#13;
Remuneration,                      In total, around 70 percent of all non-interest recurrent expenditure went on these&#13;
grants, and                        three items in FY14. Around a fifth of remuneration is spent by each of education,&#13;
subsidies dominate                 defense and public order and security, and a further 13 percent by health. Grants are&#13;

Public sector                      Between FY06 and FY14, remuneration expenditure increased by around 50 percent&#13;
remuneration has                   (Figure-24). Since this was lower than the overall non-interest recurrent increase,&#13;
been driven by                     remuneration declined from 35 to 30 percent of the total. The increase was driven&#13;
allowances,                        by allowances, which more than doubled during the period. Allowances appear to&#13;
especially in years                provide a means of increasing total remuneration during years without public sector&#13;
without pay                        pay increases. For example, spending on pay of officers and pay of establishment&#13;
increases.                         stagnated between FY06 and FY09. At the same time allowances increased by close&#13;
                                   to 50 percent but a pay increase at the beginning of FY10 boosted wages and&#13;
                                   resulted in a reduction in allowances.&#13;
&#13;
Reforms have                       After very fast expenditure growth between FY08 and FY11, the government&#13;
temporarily tamed                  enacted pension reforms in FY12. The retirement age for public sector employees&#13;
booming pension                    was increased from 57 to 59 years of age. With an estimated 40,000 public servants&#13;
expenditure but                    retiring each year the impact was strong. Expenditure on pensions and gratuities fell&#13;
significant                        from a peak of 9 percent of non-interest recurrent expenditures in FY11 to 6&#13;
challenges remain.                 percent in FY14. Expenditure fell in both real and nominal terms by around one&#13;
                                   third (Figure-25). However while these reforms helped to address challenges related&#13;

 Government development spending is growing and is broadly aligned with development priorities.&#13;

 An increase in total               Gross national investment increased from 26 percent of GDP in FY10 to 28&#13;
 investment has been                percent in FY12, before declining slightly in FY14. This increase was caused by a&#13;
 driven by public                   significant rise in public investment18 though it was unable to â&#128;&#156;crowd inâ&#128;&#157; private&#13;
 investment.                        investment over this period as investment remained constrained by a number of&#13;
                                    factors including limited access to serviced land, power and gas shortages,&#13;
                                    inadequate transport infrastructure and the difficulty in enforcing contracts. Total&#13;
                                    public investment increased from 3.9 percent of GDP in FY09 to 5.7 percent in&#13;
                                    FY14. In real terms, this represents an average annual increase of 15 percent.&#13;
                                    Although such efforts are a step in the right direction, they do not guarantee the&#13;
                                    desired results without improving the â&#128;&#156;softâ&#128;&#157; aspects of investments. Public&#13;
                                    investment is undertaken through two parallel streams â&#128;&#148; Annual Development&#13;
                                    Plan (ADP) and non-Annual Development Plan (non-ADP). Most public&#13;
                                    investments are financed through the ADP. However, an increasing proportion of&#13;
                                    public investment is financed outside the ADP (Figure-26). The share of public&#13;
                                    investment through non-ADP investment has been steadily increasing over the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
There is a perception among the general public that prices in Bangladesh move only one way: domestic prices rise in response to&#13;
rise in international prices but do not fall when international prices fall. This section analyzes the domestic price behavior of&#13;
wheat, edible oil and sugar. It finds that the domestic and international prices move together in the long run. However, the&#13;
public perception is not entirely wrong in that domestic prices adjust to rise in international prices much faster than they do to&#13;
international price declines.&#13;

                            Lanka with the monthly data covering January 2003 to December 2013. They found&#13;
                            that the domestic prices have co-moved with international food prices, and the pass&#13;
                            through effects of international food price to domestic price was highly significant.&#13;
&#13;
                            Mortaza &amp; Habibour (2008)23 examined the import price pass-through to domestic&#13;
                            prices for Bangladesh with the monthly data covering January 2000 to March 2008&#13;
                            for rice, wheat and edible oil. They also found long run stable relationships between&#13;
                            domestic prices and international prices for rice, wheat, and edible oil. This study&#13;
                            also showed the commodities with higher share of domestic supply face a lower&#13;
                            pass through elasticity of import prices on domestic prices.&#13;
&#13;
                            Here we report findings from a quantitative analysis of the relationship between&#13;
                            global and domestic prices by estimating an Error Correction Model (ECM) with&#13;
                            the monthly data from June 2010 to May 2015 on sugar, edible oil and wheat. If the&#13;
                            variables are co-integrated in long run, the ECM describes the adjustment speed of&#13;
                            domestic prices in response to international price shocks.&#13;
&#13;
 We look at the price       Wheat, edible oil (soybean oil), and sugar are considered for this analysis. Each year&#13;
 behavior of edible         these food items have large share in total food imports. From May 2014 to May&#13;
 oil, wheat and             2015, international sugar price in dollar decreased by 27 percent while domestic&#13;
 sugar, which               price in taka decreased by 5 percent, dollar price for soybean oil decreased by 19&#13;
 accounted for 72           percent while domestic price in taka decreased by 6 percent. Similarly, dollar price&#13;
 percent of total food      for wheat decreased by 28 percent while domestic price in taka decreased by 9&#13;
 imports in FY15.           percent. It shows that domestic prices are responding in the same direction as&#13;
                            international dollar price but not with the same speed. So how much time is&#13;
                            required to adjust international price in domestic market?&#13;

                                  percent, 0.16 percent, and 0.26 percent. In short run, if dollar price for sugar&#13;
                                  increases by 1 percent, the domestic price of sugar in taka increase by 0.22 percent,&#13;
                                  soybean oil increase by 0.02 percent, and wheat increase by 0.05 percent. However,&#13;
                                  the short run elasticity for soybean oil and wheat are insignificant. The statistically&#13;
                                  significant ECM result suggests that 22 percent of the divergence from the long run&#13;
                                  relationship is corrected in each month for sugar. Correspondingly 13 percent of the&#13;
                                  divergence for soybean oil, and 23 percent for wheat. In other words, to adjust&#13;
                                  international price in domestic market, it takes around 5 months for sugar, 8 months&#13;
                                  for soybean oil, and 4 months for wheat.&#13;

&#13;
               international prices. When international prices increase, a long run co-integration&#13;
               relationship exists between international and domestic prices for those&#13;
               commodities. The domestic price responds significantly in the long run (Table-13).&#13;
               To adjust to increases in international increasing price in domestic market, it takes&#13;
               nearly 1.8 months for sugar, 4.5 months for soybean oil and 2.9 months for wheat&#13;
               (Table-14). When international prices decrease, the long run co-integration&#13;
               relationship also exists for sugar, soybean oil, and wheat but it is not statistically&#13;
               significant for wheat prices. In the short run, statistically significant asymmetry is&#13;
               noticed for sugar and wheat. To adjust to decrease in international price in domestic&#13;
               market, it takes 2 months for sugar, 6 months for soybean oil and 5 months for&#13;
               wheat.&#13;
&#13;
               In sum, the above analysis suggests:&#13;
&#13;
               ï&#130;·   There exists a long run equilibrium relationship between international prices and&#13;
                   domestic prices in Bangladesh in case of sugar, edible oil and wheat, but it is not&#13;
                   one-to-one. The long run elasticity is significantly less than one in all three cases&#13;
                   suggesting that other factors (exchange rate, market power) mediate the pass-&#13;
                   through from international to domestic prices.&#13;
&#13;
               ï&#130;·   The above are consistent with the Global Competitiveness Report 2015-2016&#13;
                   finding that the extent of market dominance in Bangladesh is relatively high and&#13;
                   the effectiveness of anti-monopoly policy is low.&#13;
&#13;
               ï&#130;·   The time taken to adjust to changes in international prices varies. Domestic sugar&#13;

            Bangladesh development update : on a stable path
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Progress on reducing extreme poverty and
            boosting shared prosperity need to be further enhanced in
            the near-term by sustaining Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and
            remittances growth, creating jobs, containing inflation, and
            making progress on improving the quality of public service
            delivery. Private investments need to increase significantly
            to achieve the government’s 7 percent growth target for
            FY16. Moving forward in the immediate future, stronger
            attention is needed to (i) achieve safety and labor rights
            compliance in the garment industry, (ii) complete the
            critical ongoing road, electricity and gas development
            projects, (iii) implement the Public Private Partnership
            (PPP) law, (iv) improve the efficiency and solvency of the
            banking sector through better banking supervision and
            oversight by the Bangladesh Bank and corporate governance
            reforms in public banks, and (v) provide access to serviced
            land to domestic and foreign investors through the Special
            Economic Zones (SEZs) initiative.
