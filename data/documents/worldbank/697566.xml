            Regulation and supervision of financial
            conglomerates : the new groupwide approach and what it means
            for World Bank operations
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Financial conglomerates are firms that
            include multiple financial institutions often regulated by
            different agencies.  The trend toward conglomeration blurs
            the lines between institutions with different primary
            regulators and supervisors and so poses challenges to the
            regulatory and supervisory authorities that watch over
            financial institutions.  The authorities responsible for the
            different branches of the financial sector often have quite
            different objectives and use different methodologies. There
            are three main supervisory concerns: contagion,
            transparency, and autonomy.  In the light of these concerns,
            the main objectives are to minimize potential contagion
            within the group, promote transparency of group structure
            and finances, and promote the accountability of the
            directors and managers of individual regulated entities.  To
            achieve these objectives, one approach is to regulate and
            supervise all financial institutions in a group in a
            consolidated manner.  Another approach is to separately
            regulate and supervise the entities in the group that
            require it but not regulate or supervise the others.  This
            Note describes the responses being developed in different
            countries and international forums.  The World Bank must
            take account of these responses in its operations.  It can
            no longer view regulation and supervision of individual
            financial sectors in isolation.
