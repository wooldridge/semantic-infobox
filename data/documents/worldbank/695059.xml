NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT-&#13;
PHASE II (NARP II)&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The proposed project is the second in support of Kenya's National Agricultural&#13;
Research Program. It is a follow-up to NARP I (Credit 1 849-KE) for which the&#13;
International Development Association (IDA), the European Union, the Government of&#13;
the Netherlands, Japan, Sweden, the United States, the United Kingdom, and several other&#13;
donors provided assistance to the Government of Kenya (GOK) for program&#13;
implementation. The primary objectives of NARP I were to: (i) focus on priority research&#13;
with a likelihood of high and early returns to investments; (ii) develop technologies that&#13;
contribute to increased productivity, particularly of smallholdings; (iii) enhance producer&#13;
participation; (iv) encourage cooperation between the new Kenya Agricultural Research&#13;
Institute (KARI) and other agricultural research institutions; and (v) strengthen linkages&#13;
between research and extension. The strategy to achieve these goals was to assist GOK in&#13;
reorganizing agricultural research under a single institution, KARL, and to support the&#13;
Institute in the implementation of the research program.&#13;
1.2   NARP I has laid the institutional foundation for agricultural research and the first&#13;
phase objectives have largely been achieved. KARI has been established as a semi-&#13;
autonomous institution with its own Board and has responsibility for publicly-funded&#13;
agricultural research. Donor coordination has greatly improved. KARI's accounting&#13;
systems were reorganized and computerized. An improved Scheme of Service has been-&#13;
introduced for scientific staff. The training program has been effective. A network of,&#13;
Research Centers (RCs) has been set up with responsibility for adaptive research and&#13;
research/extension linkages. An Agricultural Research Fund (ARF), financed through&#13;
Government, donor and private industry/NGO contributions, was established to encourage&#13;
collaborative research. KARI now has considerable "on-the-shelf' technology in terms of&#13;
improved crop varieties and better cultivation practices; important achievements were also&#13;
made in the area of integrated pest management, dairy production and animal health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.3    However, the adoption of improved technologies developed by research was slow.&#13;
Several "on-the-shelf' technologies were not adequately tested and evaluated by farmers&#13;
for their relevance and adaptability. In other cases, the delivery system (e.g., for seeds and&#13;
vegetatively propagated planting materials) is not adequate. Thus, notwithstanding the&#13;
areas of progress under NARP I, there is a critical need for continued support to maintain&#13;
the momentum, address newly emerging priorities and solidify agricultural research&#13;
including increased support from the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT&#13;
2.1    Kenya is a low-income country with a per capita income of $270 in 1994. The&#13;
economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, that employs 70 percent of the labor force&#13;
and contributes about one quarter of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Coffee, tea and&#13;
horticultural crops account for over 50 percent of merchandise exports. Between 1991&#13;
and 1993, Kenya's macroeconomic performance was poor. In April 1992, the&#13;
Government agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on a program of actions&#13;
necessary to re-establish a sound macroeconomic framework which included deficit&#13;
reduction and liberalization of the foreign exchange regime. Until rmid-1993, the&#13;
implementation of the actions required was unsatisfactory. Although fiscal targets were&#13;
met, monetary targets were exceeded and the liberalization of the foreign exchange regime&#13;
proved to be unsustainable.&#13;
2.2   However, since mid-1993 there has been improvement in macroeconomic&#13;
management. Monetary policy was tightened and the economy began to stabilize.&#13;
Inflation slowed, the nominal Treasury bill rate declined and the market-determined&#13;
exchange rate appreciated paving the way for the unification of the official and market&#13;
rates. These improvements allowed the Government to negotiate a three-year Policy&#13;
Framework Paper (PFP) with the Bank and the IMF, supported by a one-year Enhanced&#13;
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). The Government's macroeconomic performance&#13;
under the reform program has been generally positive, although the deficit target was&#13;
exceeded in fiscal 1994 due to arrears in debt service payments. On the structural side,&#13;
virtually all exchange controls were abolished, the exchange rate was floated, price&#13;
controls lifted and the maize market liberalized. On the other hand, civil service reform&#13;
got off to a slow start and parastatal reform lagged. The economy's initial response to the&#13;
improved macroeconomic management measures has been positive, with the exchange rate&#13;
appreciating, reserve levels increasing, inflation declining, and real GDP growing at&#13;
around 3 percent in 1994. The Government successfully completed the ESAF&#13;
arrangement and has agreed on a new PFP (1995-97) with the Bank and the Fund. This&#13;
PFP seeks to sustain fiscal adjustment and accelerate structural reforms. Donors, in a&#13;
Consultative Group meeting in December 1994, indicated their support and pledged new&#13;
commitments of US$800 million equivalent for 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
Role in the Economy&#13;
2.3    Agriculture is still the largest single sector of the economy contributing about a&#13;
quarter of GDP. The three major agricultural exports are tea, coffee and horticultural&#13;
crops, which together account for over 50 percent of foreign exchange earnings.&#13;
Agriculture also has a significant impact on other sectors of the economy; it makes an&#13;
indirect contribution of roughly another 30 percent to GDP through the manufacturing&#13;
and service sectors. About two-thirds of industrial output in the country is agro-industry&#13;
based. The agriculture sector is composed of a traditional subsistence sub-sector and a&#13;
commercial sub-sector that include both large-scale farming and smallholder production.&#13;
Large farms (over 20 ha.) cover roughly 3.6 million ha. of total agricultural area, account&#13;
for 53 percent of marketed output and 23 percent of agricultural output. Smallholder&#13;
agriculture, with an average farm size of 1.13 ha., is the dominant mode of production,&#13;
and provides over 85 percent of total employment.&#13;
Performance&#13;
2.4   Historically, agricultural sector performance in Kenya has been better than the&#13;
average for Sub-Saharan Africa. The growth rate was about 4.7 percent per annum&#13;
between 1960 and 1970; it declined to 2.7 percent between 1970 and 1982 and then&#13;
increased to 3.8 percent from 1982-1988. Initial increases in agricultural production&#13;
stemmed mostly from the expansion of cultivated land. Agricultural growth was&#13;
subsequently sustained primarily through the introduction of technological change&#13;
embodied in the release and adoption of new varieties, related technical packages,&#13;
improved farming practices and most importantly, expanded and intensified production of&#13;
higher value-added crops. The shift in crop mix towards higher value-added commodities&#13;
accounted for as much as 65 percent of the growth in agriculture in the past 20 years.&#13;
Sector performance has worsened since 1988. The agricultural growth rate, barely&#13;
positive in 1991, turned negative in 1992. Whereas the drastic downturn in agricultural&#13;
growth resulted largely from poor rainfall, there were other factors as well, notably&#13;
declining input use, general erosion of producer incentives arising from payment delays,&#13;
weak implementation of structural reforms and inadequate support services to the sector.&#13;
The situation reversed in 1994, and agriculture grew at 5 percent. A sound policy&#13;
framework and an effective extension effort enabled the sector to respond effectively to&#13;
favorable rainfall.&#13;
Agricultural Growth: Challenges and Prospects&#13;
2.5   The country's main development needs remain those of food security, employment&#13;
creation, poverty reduction and environmental protection, and agriculture is expected to&#13;
play a critical role in meeting these challenges. About 500,000 people will enter the labor&#13;
force annually between now and the year 2000, putting increasing pressure on the urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
labor markets which cannot cope with this influx. The most recent Country Economic&#13;
Memorandum (CEM) suggests that the economy has to grow at a rate of about 7 percent&#13;
annually to meet the employment challenge, underpinned by at least a 4.4 percent growth&#13;
in agricultural production and 1.5 percent growth in productivity; this scenario implies that&#13;
employment in agriculture would need to grow at 2.9 percent per annum. Taking&#13;
agriculture back on a sustainable growth path is also crucial for reducing rural poverty.&#13;
The Kenya Poverty Assessment Report shows that the bulk of the poor live in rural areas,&#13;
two-thirds of them in the high- and medium-potential areas. The report states that&#13;
productivity growth in agriculture is vital to make a dent in rural poverty alleviation and&#13;
concludes that per capita income growth is clearly the top priority requiring both&#13;
productivity growth and structural transformation in agriculture.&#13;
2.6    A detailed 1995 review of the agricultural sector by the Bank' suggests that the&#13;
agricultural growth challenge can be met. Major growth is expected to be generated by&#13;
the smallholder sector, given that the smallholder yields are well below their potential.&#13;
The report argues that increases in crop yields and livestock productivity, and shifts&#13;
towards higher-value crops will be the dominant sources of growth. The report states that&#13;
the strategy to promote smallholder-led growth should include increased producer&#13;
incentives through improved and more competitive marketing structures and more&#13;
efficient distribution channels, enhanced use of agricultural inputs, improved efficiency in&#13;
public investment/expenditure allocations, the continued development of smallholder&#13;
technologies and more efficient use of agricultural land.&#13;
2.7    Regarding the policy framework, significant improvements have taken place in the&#13;
last two years and critical reforms are being undertaken to encourage private sector&#13;
initiative and involvement in all aspects of production, processing and marketing of key&#13;
agricultural and livestock commodities and in the provision of agricultural support&#13;
services. The institutional structure of the sector is being reformulated and the role of the&#13;
Government is being re-aligned from direct intervention to an indirect role of setting the&#13;
incentive framework and organizing the regulatory and enabling environment. Progress&#13;
on the structural front, however, is slow; significant public sector involvement remains in&#13;
maize, wheat and milk marketing and the divestiture of public sector ownership of sugar&#13;
factories is progressing slowly. These structural issues are being addressed in the context&#13;
of the overall dialogue on the PFP.&#13;
2.8    A significant immediate growth response can only be elicited from the full&#13;
liberalization and deregulation of markets for agricultural products and inputs as is evident&#13;
from coffee, where the slightly higher prices supported by an improved payment system&#13;
under the IDA-financed Second Coffee Improvement Project (SCIP II, Cr. 2062-KE)), is&#13;
resulting in better husbandry practices and increased yields. The second source of growth&#13;
would come from taking Kenyan agriculture back on the growth path based on raising&#13;
performance of existing farming units through the application of "on the shelf'&#13;

technologies such as new varieties and better farming and resource conservation practices&#13;
and of new, improved technologies being developed. Such technologies can come from&#13;
ongoing research programs in traditional crops such as maize, wheat, sorghum and millet,&#13;
and in animal health and dairy production (e.g., through promotion of zero grazing and&#13;
improved forage crops). There is also potential to introduce improved technology in the&#13;
semi-arid lands where gains would be possible from non-traditional crops such as oilseeds&#13;
and cotton.&#13;
2.9   The third source of growth would come from transforming smallholder farms from&#13;
a subsistence mode to a farm enterprise orientation by accelerating the change in the mix&#13;
of farming activities to those which add more value per unit of land and labor. Such&#13;
changes will require a shift from low-return food crops for subsistence consumption&#13;
(maize, sorghum, millet and cassava) towards high-value-added enterprises (dairy,&#13;
horticulture, tea, sugarcane, pyrethrum, etc.). Although this is happening in some of the&#13;
high-potential areas, the change is currently frustrated by the inability of the service&#13;
delivery systems to effectively respond to farmer demands. NARP II has a crucial role to&#13;
play in bringing about this transformation.&#13;
C. GOVERNMENT POLICY OBJECTIVES AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY&#13;
2.10  The Goverrnment's development strategy was earlier articulated in Sessional Paper&#13;
No. 1, Economic Management for Renewed Growth (1986), and a Letter of Sectoral&#13;
Policy prepared by GOK, as part of the proposed Arid Lands Resource Management&#13;
Project (ALRMP). Both the Development Plan for 1994-96 and the recently released&#13;
Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1994, Macroeconomic and Structural Policy Frameworkfor&#13;
1995-1997, underscore the theme of sustainable development. Government strategy is&#13;
based on realigning the policy framework and the incentives structure, and on encouraging&#13;
a more competitive marketing system with increased participation of the private sector in&#13;
all aspects of marketing and distribution of agricultural commodities. It states the&#13;
Government's intent to reduce its role and that of parastatal organizations in the sector as&#13;
part of a strategy to create an enabling environment for greater private initiative,&#13;
restructuring marketing parastatals and liberalizing markets. The Government's&#13;
development strategy outlined in a Letter of Subsectoral Policy for Agricultural Research&#13;
also recognizes the need to provide support for the core programs in agricultural research&#13;
and extension.&#13;
2.11  The Government strategy is sound in its key provisions but requires sustained&#13;
commitment and implementation. Substantial progress has been achieved to date. Prices&#13;
of agricultural crops have been largely liberalized, and marketing restrictions removed. A&#13;
decision has been taken to greatly reduce the role of the National Cereals and Produce&#13;
Board (NCPB) in the marketing of maize and to commercialize the organization by the&#13;
end of 1996. The Cotton Board's ginneries have been sold or are in the process of being&#13;
sold, and the state sugar refineries are being prepared for sale. A decision has been taken&#13;
to privatize seed production and distribution. Barriers to entry of private firms into the&#13;
dairy industry have been removed. Thus, steps to strengthen the policy and institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
framework are being taken, and the agricultural research system needs to be further&#13;
enhanced to provide the technology for smallholder farmers to take advantage of the new&#13;
environment.&#13;
D. PROJECT CONTEXT&#13;
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
2.12  The proposed project would be a key element of the Bank's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) which was discussed by the Board on January 30, 1996. The CAS&#13;
supports the reduction of poverty through accelerated economic growth and employment&#13;
generation, by promoting an enabling environment for the private sector, improved&#13;
efficiency in the public sector, human capital development, better environment&#13;
management, and targeted interventions for the disadvantaged. As the dominant sector&#13;
and with substantial potential, agriculture has a central role to play in the development&#13;
strategy. The sector assistance strategy, developed in a continuing dialogue with the&#13;
Government and other stakeholders, is reflected in the Agricultural Sector Review and&#13;
focuses on revitalizing the rural economy, particularly through further liberalization of&#13;
marketing and processing of agricultural commodities, and through raising smallholder&#13;
productivity and advancing crop diversification. Structural transformation of the&#13;
smallholder farm base would be fostered through increased emphasis on higher-value&#13;
crops, promoted through technology generation and dissemination. This strategy is being&#13;
supported through a series of sector operations. The Second Agriculture Sector&#13;
Management Project (ASMP II, Cr. 2445-KE) is supporting the formulation of a vision&#13;
and role for Government in a liberalized agricultural sector, as well as the strengthening of&#13;
management and analytical capacity in MALDM. Commercialization of NCPB is being&#13;
discussed as part of the policy dialogue, while privatization of parastatals in the cotton and&#13;
sugar subsectors is being supported under ASMP II. In the seeds subsector, the policy&#13;
and institutional framework would be strengthened under NARP II.&#13;
2.13   Support for technology generation and dissemination has been provided under&#13;
NARP I and a series of extension operations, of which the Second National Extension&#13;
Project (NEP II, Cr. 2199-KE) is currently under implementation. Further support for&#13;
technology generation, as well as strengthened linkages to extension, would be provided&#13;
under NARP II. In view of its predominant smallholder base, agriculture is at the center&#13;
of the country's poverty reduction efforts and of the Bank's poverty assistance strategy, as&#13;
described in the Poverty Assessment Report. Agriculture is also the dominant element-in&#13;
environment management and in the country's National Environment Action Plan,&#13;
developed with assistance from the Bank and other donors. Thus the proposed project&#13;
would also be an important component of the Bank's environment assistance strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
Rationale for Bank Assistance&#13;
2.14 The Bank has played an important role in advising the Government on&#13;
macroeconomic and agricultural development in the context of sound environment&#13;
management and with a strong focus on poverty reduction. It has assisted with the policy&#13;
framework for the agricultural research subsector, the strategy and plan for its&#13;
development and the implementation of that plan in coordination with other major donors.&#13;
The Bank worked closely with the Government and other donors in designing and&#13;
implementing the National Agricultural Research Project, which supported the first phase&#13;
of a longer-term program for strengthening agricultural research capacity of the country.&#13;
The Bank has continued this involvement during the preparation of the proposed project,&#13;
although in more of a supporting role as the Government's capacity has expanded, and&#13;
with particular assistance to the Government on donor coordination. The Bank is now in&#13;
a position to make a further contribution, in terms of the readjustment of public and&#13;
private sector roles in agricultural research, raising the efficiency of KARI, and focusing&#13;
public research on the highest priorities for growth and poverty alleviation. This&#13;
contribution would complement the Bank's support for initiatives in extension,&#13;
environment/natural resource management, and agricultural sector management.&#13;
Project Preparation&#13;
2.15  The project was prepared by a Government task force, led by KARI and including&#13;
all major stakeholders from the public and private sectors, supported by IDA and other&#13;
major donors. Particular efforts were made to include farmers into the process for setting&#13;
research priorities, through their participation in the local and regional committees.&#13;
Lessons learned (see below) from the first project, as well as other projects in Kenya and&#13;
elsewhere, were incorporated into the proposed project. During implementation,&#13;
emphasis would be given to the farming systems approach (FSA) pioneered under the first&#13;
project, involving farmers and extensionists in the identification of problems, and in&#13;
research design and implementation, with a focus on research in farmers' fields.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
2.16   The Bank has accumulated considerable experience in supporting research projects&#13;
throughout the developing world. The proposed project was able to build on lessons&#13;
gained during the initial project, other agricultural projects in Kenya, and agricultural&#13;
research projects in other countries. For instance, uniting donor efforts in a single project&#13;
is desirable, but as the number of participants, project size and complexity increases,&#13;
difficulties in coordinating donors also increase. The project will institutionalize KARI's&#13;
capacity to coordinate donors by supporting the operations of KARI's Donor&#13;
Coordination Unit (DCU). The DCU's monitoring and evaluation capacity will be&#13;
enhanced. It will also establish standard formats for the preparation of reports on&#13;
procurement, training, and overall project progress and finances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.    Project performance of NARP I has been rated as satisfactory in the&#13;
Implementation Completion Report. Overall performance of projects in Kenya, however,&#13;
has been affected by inadequate and tardy counterpart funding, weak management and&#13;
financial systems, and inadequate incentive and reward systems to motivate staff. Under&#13;
the project, improved management arrangements, and streamlined financial and accounting&#13;
systems would improve project management and the flow of funds. Key financial&#13;
operations would be decentralized to the research centers whose directors would be&#13;
delegated greater authority for financial transactions. A performance appraisal system&#13;
would be implemented to determine staff promotion and rewards.&#13;
2.17  In a project where major institutional change is an objective, key elements of&#13;
change, e.g., retrenchment of staff, rationalization of the number and functions of research&#13;
centers, and streamlining of the priority setting process, have been identified and given&#13;
indicative timetables. Participation of farmer clients, and linkages with the extension&#13;
service, through mechanisms such as the Farming Systems Approach (FSA) introduced&#13;
under NARP L would be greatly expanded in NARP II. Partnerships with producer and&#13;
processor associations, and academic institutions would be fostered through research&#13;
supported by the Agricultural Research Fund (ARF), also initiated under NARP I.&#13;
Building on the successful experience with tea and coffee research, responsibility for&#13;
research on selected industrial crops would be transferred to the private sector during the&#13;
course of NARP II. Phasing in of other project actions would be conditional on&#13;
institutional progress which would be reviewed during supervision missions involving&#13;
other donors and KARI.Agricultural Research&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH&#13;
National Strategy for Agricultural Research&#13;
3.1    As noted earlier, the overall aim of agricultural sector development is to accelerate&#13;
the production of food, industrial, and export crops, and livestock and forestry products,&#13;
on a sustainable basis, thereby contributing to the growth in rural incomes and&#13;
employment, as well as improved food security. The generation and dissemination of&#13;
technology are crucial to achieving this.&#13;
3.2   In view of increasingly severe financial resource constraints, the roles of the public&#13;
and private sectors in agricultural research are undergoing change. In the public sector,&#13;
scarce resources are being focused on the highest research priorities, particularly in those&#13;
areas where the private sector will not contribute (especially food crops, forage crops and&#13;
natural resource management). In order to pursue these priorities in a more effective and&#13;
efficient manner, the institutional framework is being streamlined, a performance-oriented&#13;
incentives structure is being introduced, and partnership with stakeholders, principally&#13;
farmers, is being strengthened. The private sector is being encouraged to assume greater&#13;
responsibility for financing research from which it receives direct benefits, particularly in&#13;
the case of cash crops.&#13;
Public Sector Role&#13;
3.3    KARI has undertaken a broad review of national research priorities and has&#13;
identified adaptive research on major food crops (maize, wheat, sorghum, millet, potato,&#13;
cassava, sweet potato and pulses) and livestock (grass and forage crops, dairy and beef&#13;
cattle, sheep and goats) as the highest priorities for the public sector. KARI is now&#13;
turning its attention to an evaluation of priorities within these broad categories, in&#13;
particular with a view to identifying "trigger technologies"--those which can have the&#13;
greatest impact in the shortest period of time. This exercise, completed in July 1995, has&#13;
reconfirmed that the priorities determined earlier remain essentially the same. These&#13;
priorities, listed in the Project Implementation Manual2 will be the focus of NARP II. In&#13;
addition, KARI will be periodically reviewing research areas within the broad commodity&#13;
groups as part of the annual review process to accommodate changing circumstances.&#13;
This review will deterrnine the research agenda for each coming year. The allocation of&#13;
resources will be set and adjusted in accordance with the refined priorities resulting from&#13;
this process.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
3.4    KARI has long recognized the difficulty farmers have had in achieving satisfactory&#13;
yield levels, even when such yield potentials are established through on-farm research.&#13;
KARI believes that substantial progress can be made in part through the strengthening of&#13;
partnerships, specially farmer participation in research priority setting, technology&#13;
verification and adaptation, and impact evaluation. Another factor will be the incentives&#13;
system within KARI, which will emphasize farm level impact of research results. In&#13;
addition, KARI's expanded socioeconomic capacity will devote increased attention to&#13;
farm-level analysis and the development of simple methods for measuring the effects of a&#13;
new variety, improved farming practices, etc.&#13;
3.5    KARI is transforming itself into a leaner, more effective institution through the&#13;
research prioritization process where beneficiaries participate. This involves&#13;
rationalization of the research center network, retrenchment of around 1,400 non-essential&#13;
support staff, redeployment of scientists, enhancement of human resource development,&#13;
and improved research management such as a new system for internal review and approval&#13;
of research proposals, introduction of a new financial management system, and&#13;
integrating/upgrading KARI' s information management system. These initiatives will be&#13;
undertaken as part of KARl's strategic plan, that will be supported under the proposed&#13;
project. The Government will need to assume greater responsibility for funding the leaner&#13;
KARI, particularly increased funding of non-salary operating costs.&#13;
3.6    KARl's institutional development program will include the strengthening of its&#13;
planning capacity. Part of this effort will be directed toward investment planning, in order&#13;
that KARI will be in a position to operate effectively within the framework of a future&#13;
Agricultural Sector Investment Program (ASIP). In fact, KARI will serve as a pilot for&#13;
ASIP, which will be able to draw on the experience of the strengthened investment&#13;
planning efforts of the institute.&#13;
3.7    While KARI has been strengthening its linkages with farmers, the extension&#13;
service, universities, and industry associations, it recognizes that there is considerable&#13;
potential for expanding these partnerships. Various mechanisms have been developed,&#13;
e.g., on-farn trials, joint activities with the extension service, and team research with&#13;
universities. Major efforts will be devoted to building on the existing foundation,&#13;
particularly with respect to involving the farmer clients. The ARF will foster these&#13;
relationships, since it will favor proposals which emphasize teamwork among stakeholders&#13;
and linkages with universities. KARL will also enhance its collaboration with regional and&#13;
international research institutions, and it has agreed to become the National Agricultural&#13;
Information Focal Point (NAIFP) for East Africa under the initiative of the Special&#13;
Program for African Agriculture Research (SPAAR).&#13;
Private Sector Role&#13;
3.8    As part of the Government's overall liberalization strategy for transition to a&#13;
market-oriented economy, the private sector is being encouraged to assume responsibility&#13;
for functions for which it is best suited. In the case of agricultural research, a variety of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
mechanisms are being developed to induce the private sector to assume these&#13;
responsibilities. These include complete transfer of responsibility for research programs to&#13;
industry associations, (e.g., sugar and pyrethrum), contract research, and various forms of&#13;
cost-sharing.&#13;
3.9    Tea and coffee research are already fully supported by the private sector through&#13;
cess funding. Responsibility for sugar research is being assumed by the industry&#13;
association, and therefore will not be supported under the proposed project. In the case of&#13;
cotton, the proposed Cotton Development Council will help mobilize additional resources&#13;
for research, and it is expected that the industry will assume full responsibility for research&#13;
by the end of NARP II. For pyrethrum, the National Pyrethrum Board already provides&#13;
substantial support for research undertaken by KARI and it is expected that the industry&#13;
will assume full responsibility for research by the end of NARP II. Oilseeds represent a&#13;
special case, because of the large production potential but low output at present.&#13;
Nevertheless, a program has been prepared for the development of this industry, including&#13;
oilseeds research. In the case of cotton, pyrethrum, and oilseeds, the project would&#13;
provide a small amount of support for the research programs, to provide a bridge to the&#13;
assumption of full responsibility by the respective industries.&#13;
3.10   The private sector has been instrumental for developing technologies to promote&#13;
the production and exports, specially of ornamental crops. In the last five years, Kenya&#13;
has become one of the leading exporters of macadamia nuts as a result of KARI's&#13;
introduction of higher yielding hybrid varieties. In the case of horticulture, the value of&#13;
fresh horticultural produce rose from KSh 1.4 billion in 1989 to KSh 4.8 billion in 1994,&#13;
with a significant portion exported, largely through the initiatives of the private sector.&#13;
3.11   For industries or organizations which have particular problems that they want to&#13;
have investigated, KARI would do so on a contract basis. If the issue is of high priority in&#13;
the research agenda and the industry is unable to support the full cost of the research,&#13;
KARI would carry it out on a cost-sharing basis. In the case of staple crops and smaller&#13;
organizations, e.g., farmers' associations or groups, KARI would expand the cost-sharing&#13;
arrangements that it has been developing on a pilot basis. The project would support the&#13;
expansion of KARl's capacity to carry out such research, with the cost to be recovered in&#13;
part or in full, depending on the specific arrangements.&#13;
3.12 Finally, the ARF would become an increasingly important instrument for&#13;
mobilizing support from the private sector and for fostering cooperative arrangements&#13;
among the public sector (KARI), the private sector, academia, other research institutes,&#13;
and national and international research centers.&#13;
Institutional Framework&#13;
3.13   Agricultural research is conducted by a network of organizations in the public and&#13;
private sectors, and KARI is the lead institution of this network. Tea and coffee research&#13;
is undertaken by separate institutes supported by a cess on the produce. Research is also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
undertaken by the universities, research foundations, and private industries. KARI&#13;
operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Research, Technical Training, and&#13;
Technology (MRTTT) and is chartered to conduct research in all agricultural disciplines&#13;
and commodities, with the exception of forestry and fisheries.&#13;
3.14  KARI operates under a Board of Management, with members consisting of&#13;
representatives of the funding ministry (MRTTT), the "client" ministry (MALDM), and&#13;
two representatives of the farming community. The Director-General, the chief executive&#13;
officer of KARI, is an ex-officio member of the Board. Headquarters is located at Kabete,&#13;
just outside Nairobi. The institute operates a network of some 15 national centers, of&#13;
which 4 also have regional mandates, focusing on applied research on various&#13;
commodities and factors of production, e.g., soil, fertilizers, water, pesticides, etc.. and 6&#13;
regional centers, focusing on adaptation of technologies to dominant crop/livestock&#13;
production systems in various agroclimatic zones. A list of NRCs, RRCs and associated&#13;
outreach stations is provided in Annex 11. Close coordination is maintained with the&#13;
extension service, under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between KARI&#13;
(MRTTT) and MALDM which provides for a number of joint activities, including on-farm&#13;
research and membership of extension officers in the advisory committees of NRCs and&#13;
RRCs.&#13;
NARP I Results and Impact&#13;
3.15   Subsector Development Program. NARP I supported the first phase of a&#13;
subsector development program for agricultural research. It supported priority adaptive&#13;
research programs, and concurrently introduced a process for defining national research&#13;
priorities. It also supported the strengthening of the institutional and physical&#13;
infrastructure for research. Implementation of the project was marked by close&#13;
cooperation among Government agencies, especially with the extension service, and close&#13;
coordination of multilateral (EU and IBRD) and bilateral (United States, The Netherlands,&#13;
Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, Sweden, etc.) donors.&#13;
3.16  Implementation. Major achievements under NARP I have been the establishment&#13;
of essential agricultural research infrastructure, the training and upgrading of KARI's&#13;
human resources, the establishment of an ARF to finance collaborative research contracts,&#13;
the rehabilitation of a network of Research Centers serving specific commodities and&#13;
agroclimatic zones, and the development of improved technology for important crops,&#13;
livestock production and natural resource management.&#13;
3.17  Research Results &amp; Impact. Significant achievements have been attained in&#13;
maize, the primary staple crop. Two hybrids, suitable for the coast and high altitude areas,&#13;
have been introduced and now are planted on about 75 percent of the area planted to&#13;
maize. Average maize yield has increased from around 1 ton per hectare to 3.5 tons per&#13;
hectare since the introduction of these hybrids, although expansion into more marginal&#13;
areas has masked the impact of the hybrids, to some extent. Ten new cultivars will soon&#13;
be released for the lowland coastal, mid-altitude dry and moist, and highland production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
environments. Drought-tolerant and disease-resistant varieties of sorghum, millet, cassava&#13;
and sweet potato have been released for the drier areas. Several superior varieties of rice,&#13;
grain legumes, and wheat have also been released. All these varieties yield higher than the&#13;
traditional varieties, due to better disease and insect resistance, and/or shorter maturity&#13;
which allow them to escape critical periods of drought.&#13;
3.18   Concerning livestock, KARL adapted the "zero grazing" system for dairy cattle to&#13;
local conditions, particularly the integration of the widely-grown Napier grass, which&#13;
forms the basis of the system, now widely practiced by smallholders. An increase of&#13;
400,000 dairy cattle was recorded from 1987 to 1991. KARI has developed effective&#13;
methods of immunizing cattle against East Coast Fever, and these are now ready for&#13;
widespread dissemination. Significant progress has been made in the development of a&#13;
dual-purpose goat for meat and milk production. A multiplication program for these goats&#13;
is being developed with MALDM.&#13;
3.19  Regarding natural resource management, KARI has determined fertilizer response&#13;
(nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and farmyard manure) under a variety of local&#13;
conditions and generated a series of recommendations for extension. KARI also provides&#13;
important analytical and advisory services on soil and plant management, fertilizer quality,&#13;
and animal feed. The Fertilizer Use Recommendation Project (FURP) funded by the EU&#13;
and implemented for several years by researchers in farmers' fields at 71 sites in 31&#13;
districts has established a solid base to predict crop responses to NPK and farmyard&#13;
manure, and to develop useful extension recommendations. In the Arid and Semi-Arid&#13;
Lands (ASAL), different soil and water management practices and their effect on&#13;
agricultural production were investigated; soil "pitting" and "tied" ridges were found to be&#13;
effective for water conservation and are being adopted in several areas. Research on the&#13;
long-term impact of land-use systems in important agro-ecological zones established the&#13;
effectiveness of several low-cost sustainable soil fertility management strategies.&#13;
3.20  KARl's capacity for socioeconomic analysis has been strengthened considerably,&#13;
with important effects on the priority-setting process, identification of policy issues,&#13;
development of the farming systems approach, and the quality of diagnostic surveys.&#13;
Remaining Agenda&#13;
3.21  NARP II would support the second phase of the subsector development program,&#13;
in particular, the further strengthening of the prioritization and resource allocation&#13;
processes; expansion of priority adaptive research, building on successful experience under&#13;
the first phase; human resource capacity building, and further enhancement of KARI's&#13;
organization and management systems. Emphasis would be given to a refinement of&#13;
priorities to focus on specific promising technologies, adaptive research in accordance&#13;
with these priorities (financed in part through the ARF), renewed efforts on technology&#13;
adoption through strengthened partnerships, a streamlined public sector research&#13;
establishment, increased responsibility of the private sector for research, preparation of a&#13;
rolling subsector investment program, and further strengthened donor coordination. Since&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
inadequate access to quality seed has been identified as a major obstacle to accelerated&#13;
growth in productivity, support would be provided for pilot seed production and&#13;
distribution programs, particularly for the development of the private, informal sector.&#13;
Similarly, the project would facilitate an expansion of KARI's soil fertility management&#13;
advisory services on a full cost-recovery basis (para. 4.19).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1    The project would contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and environmental&#13;
protection by raising agricultural productivity and incomes on a sustained basis through&#13;
technology generation and dissemination in close cooperation with farmers and&#13;
extensionists, with particular emphasis on technologies which take into account indigenous&#13;
knowledge and are appropriate for smallholders and women. Improved technology would&#13;
enable smallholders to raise yields of existing crops and also allow them to shift part of their&#13;
land resources into higher-value crops, thus raising food security and incomes.&#13;
4.2   NARP II is designed to support, in particular, an intensified effort toward&#13;
technology development and adaptation to specific agro-ecological and socioeconomnic&#13;
environments and improvement of the technology delivery systems, particularly through&#13;
more effective collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Development and&#13;
Marketing (MALDM) and the universities, and active participation of smallholder farmers&#13;
and other intended beneficiaries. An important focus of NARP II is on establishing&#13;
appropriate procedures for the timely availability and efficient use of all available financial&#13;
and human resources for agricultural research and the strengthening of KARI's capacity for&#13;
the assessment of research impact.&#13;
B. PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
4.3    NARP II would consist of the following three main components:&#13;
a)    Institution Building (approximately US$84.1 million). This component&#13;
would support KARl's transformation into a leaner, more efficient&#13;
organization focused on carrying out adaptive research in accordance with&#13;
the highest national priorities and promoting the dissemination of proven&#13;
technology to farmers, particularly smallholders and women. Emphasis&#13;
would be given to enhanced research management, financial management,&#13;
human resource development, and an upgraded information system. For this&#13;
component (as for b and c below), the project will provide financing for staff&#13;
salaries (largely from GOK), infrastructure rehabilitation, vehicles, plant and&#13;
equipment, technical assistance, training and incremental operating and&#13;
maintenance costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
b)    Research Program Implementation (US$88.0 million). This component&#13;
will finance high-priority adaptive research programs implemented through&#13;
the RRCs, commodity and factor (of production) research implemented&#13;
through the NRCs, research in natural resource management, socioeconomic&#13;
research, collaborative research with universities, IARCs and National&#13;
Agricultural Research Systems (NARSs) of the Eastern Africa region; and&#13;
cofinancing of research proposals with the private sector for selected&#13;
research topics on a competitive basis through the ARF.&#13;
c)    Seeds Program. (US$7.8 million). This component will finance a pilot&#13;
scheme to develop a sustainable national seed system that can ensure the&#13;
availability of the quantity and quality of seeds required by farmers in a&#13;
timely manner. Based on demand, basic seed will be produced by financially&#13;
autonomous Foundation Seed Units (FSU) at selected KARI Research&#13;
Centers, while commercial seed will be produced by the formal and informal&#13;
private sectors.&#13;
C. DETAILED FEATURES&#13;
Institution Building&#13;
4.4   KARI intends to become more efficient in carrying out problem-oriented applied&#13;
and adaptive research in accordance with the highest national priorities and in promoting&#13;
the dissemination of proven technology to farmers. This transformation, initiated during&#13;
NARP I will be continued during NARP II, in accordance with KARl's Strategic&#13;
(Corporate) Plan, which has been revised in the light of present circumstances. The Plan&#13;
will serve as the conceptual framework for institution building under the project. KARl's&#13;
institutional development efforts during this phase of the transformation (paras. 5.2-5.8)&#13;
will focus on research management and programming, financial management, improving&#13;
the ARF, an integrated information system, human resource development, and monitoring&#13;
and evaluation. KARI will also pursue the transfer of research responsibility, specially on&#13;
industrial crops, to the private sector.&#13;
4.5    KARI has initiated the process of sharing the cost of research with the private&#13;
sector where feasible, as in the case of cash crops, through various mechanisms.&#13;
KARI has prepared a conceptual paper on Alternative Sources of Funds (ASF) and has&#13;
a plan to transfer the responsibilities of financing research for cash crops, particularly&#13;
pyrethrum, sugar, horticultural crops, and rice to the private sector. Agreement was&#13;
reached during negotiations that KARI shall prepare and adopt, not later than 12 months&#13;
after the effective date, an implementation plan for the private sector financing of&#13;
agricultural research and eventually, its taking over full responsibility to carry out and&#13;
finance these research activities as appropriate; and that a fill report on the progress of&#13;
these arrangements will be prepared and assessed during the mid-term review of the&#13;
project (para. 7.1a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
4.6    Research Management. KARl's management of research programs is being&#13;
strengthened to focus on the highest national priorities and raise the efficiency of program&#13;
implementation. KARI has reconfirmed the broad research priorities in crops (maize,&#13;
wheat, sorghum/mnillet, pulses), livestock (grass and forages, cattle for milk and beef,&#13;
sheep and goats) and natural resource conservation (soil fertility management,&#13;
maintenance of biodiversity, soil and water conservation), and is reviewing the priorities&#13;
within each of these subsectors (e.g., resistance to leaf streak virus, Fusarium wilt disease,&#13;
and the parasitic weed Striga affecting maize and sorghum). KARI has confirmed that&#13;
this process has already been completed. During negotiations, KARI's annual work&#13;
program and budget for the first year of the project was agreed and finalized (para. 7. Ib).&#13;
4.7   In order to ensure that research programs are in line with the priority framework&#13;
and have the intended impact, KARI has revised the system for the preparation, review,&#13;
approval, monitoring, and evaluation of proposals, including the roles of the Center&#13;
Research Advisory Committees (CRACs) and the Regional Research/Extension Advisory&#13;
Committees (RREACs). An important change to be progressively introduced under the&#13;
project would be that authority and responsibility for implementing the research programs,&#13;
including financial operations, will be decentralized to the centers, once the annual work&#13;
program and budget have been approved. This process will be introduced initially at two&#13;
NRCs and two RRCs, and gradually extended to the other centers as experience is gained.&#13;
4.8   KARI will also rationalize its center network in accordance with the priority&#13;
framework and ensure that the lead center for each priority program receives adequate&#13;
resources to implement the agreed program effectively. KARI would submit to the&#13;
Association its plan for the rationalization of its network of research centers which is on-&#13;
going, not later than July 1, 1997. Implementation progress would be assessed during the&#13;
mid-term review of the project (para. 7. lc). The "new" KARI will require fewer staff to&#13;
undertake research programs through a reduced network of centers. KARI has prepared a&#13;
program for phasing out approximately 1400 non-essential support staff over a four year&#13;
period. A detailed plan for implementing this program has been prepared and has been&#13;
provided to IDA. The Government has approved KARl's proposed staff retrenchment&#13;
plan and has authorized KARI to seek the required financing of such plan. The&#13;
Government also agreed to allow KARI to reallocate savings arising from the&#13;
retrenchment to augment KARl's annual operations and maintenance budgets (para&#13;
7.1d).&#13;
4.9   Financial Management. As part of improving research management, KARI's&#13;
financial management and accounting systems are being strengthened to ensure that all-&#13;
financial resources are mobilized and allocated efficiently in accordance with the research&#13;
priorities, funds are made available to researchers in a timely manner, costs (and, in some&#13;
cases, revenue) are properly allocated to programs and centers, accounts are kept current,&#13;
financial statements are produced promptly at the end of the reporting period, and internal&#13;
and external auditing processes are carried out in an effective and timely manner. The&#13;
finance and accounting offices at headquarters are being restructured under a streamlined&#13;
organizational setup (Charts I and 2). Details are provided in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan (Annex 4). Budgeting/accounting functions are being decentralized to the centers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Internal audit will be carried out to monitor implementation of financial controls.&#13;
Significant progress is being made by KARI in installing the computerized, program-based&#13;
financial management and accounting system. The initial number of pilot research centers&#13;
which will use the new system has been increased from ten to fourteen. Training of the&#13;
accounts staff of these pilot centers has been completed. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that after the first project year, and every year thereafter, a comprehensive&#13;
review would be held, in cooperation with other donors, to consider the annual work plan&#13;
and the new financial procedures and arrangements for the forthcoming fiscal year, and&#13;
that modifications in project design or procedures would be introduced as appropriate.&#13;
(para. 7. le).&#13;
4.10   Human Resource Development. KARI has initiated the process of strengthening&#13;
its management of human resources to ensure that they operate in an appropriate- incentive&#13;
framework for achieving the objectives of the organization and for effectively&#13;
implementing priority research programs. As part of this effort, a new performance&#13;
appraisal system is being designed, which will seek to ensure that rewards (including&#13;
promotions) are linked to performance. In order to implement the system, personnel&#13;
management will be strengthened under the project through the training of staff. In&#13;
addition, human resource specialists will be designated at each of seven larger centers and&#13;
provided appropriate training. The performance appraisal system was discussed and&#13;
finalized during negotiations (para; 7.1]). Approval of the performance appraisal system&#13;
by KARl's Board of Management is expected shortly.&#13;
4.11   Another element is the introduction of an expanded training program to upgrade&#13;
management, technical and administrative skills among managers, researchers and support&#13;
staff. A training policy statement has been adopted. A training needs assessment was&#13;
carried out with the assistance of the International Service for National Agricultural&#13;
Research (ISNAR) utilizing funds provided under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF).&#13;
On the basis of this assessment, the long-term training program will be revised&#13;
accordingly. In the meantime, some training identified during appraisal, e.g., financial&#13;
management system operations and computerization, would proceed, but subsequent&#13;
training will be undertaken in accordance with the final program. IDA support would&#13;
focus on in-service training of management, scientific, and support staff, plus a limited&#13;
number of post-graduate training mostly at local institutions. In addition, the project&#13;
would support the strengthening of the Training Unit at KARI to expand its capability to&#13;
organize courses and seminars (conducted largely by outside trainers and institutions),&#13;
through the provision of office equipment, staff training and financing of incremental&#13;
operating costs.&#13;
4.12  Information Systems. KARl's information system is being strengthened to&#13;
provide relevant and timely information to managers and researchers and to facilitate&#13;
communication and exchange of information between KARI staff and with outside&#13;
institutions. KARI is preparing an information technology strategy for generating and&#13;
disseminating essential information, including the operations of the NAIFP and a related&#13;
computerization plan. All information support is being centralized in an information&#13;
technology unit, which will establish, operate, and maintain the new management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
information system (MIS), agriculture/research data bases, and enhanced library and&#13;
publication services. The project would support this effort through the provision of&#13;
incremental hardware and software in accordance with the computerization program,&#13;
training of staff, technical assistance and procurement of scientific literature and&#13;
references.&#13;
Priority Applied Research Programs&#13;
4.13  Adaptive Research at RRCs. KARI has adopted the Farming Systems Approach&#13;
(FSA) for the development and adaptation of technology. This approach entails the use of&#13;
research methods that promote close cooperation between farmers, extension staff and&#13;
researchers to identify production constraints and adapt technologies to the beneficiaries'&#13;
requirements and circumstances. The FSA was strengthened significantly under NARP I,&#13;
and NARP II would build on this foundation through a further increase and reallocation of&#13;
resources to the highest priority activities. This strengthening would be undertaken in&#13;
accordance with the FSA strategy and manual that has been prepared by KARI. IDA will&#13;
support operations and adaptive research activities of six of the ten RRCs; ODA and The&#13;
Netherlands will support the rest. Emphasis will be made on encouraging the active&#13;
participation of the intended beneficiaries to ensure that the processes for identifying&#13;
research projects are sound.&#13;
4.14  Technical backstopping to the RRCs would be provided by the NRCs where&#13;
required. Under the new financial management system (para. 4.9), RRC directors would&#13;
have authority and accountability for spending funds in accordance with the approved&#13;
research program and budget. In support of the high priority programs, the rehabilitation&#13;
of two RRCs at Embu and Mtwapa would be completed, additional vehicles, office,&#13;
laboratory and field equipment would be procured to meet the needs of expanded&#13;
programs, staff training and short-term technical assistance would be provided, and&#13;
incremental operating costs would be financed.&#13;
4.15  Linkages among researchers, extension staff, and farmers were strengthened&#13;
considerably under NARP I and a memorandum of understanding was concluded between&#13;
MRTTT (KARI) and MALDM which sets out the arrangements for training of extension&#13;
staff, joint workshops and field visits, collaborative on-farm research, etc.. The results to&#13;
date have been highly positive. The program would be expanded under NARP II,&#13;
primarily through provision to KARI of funds to match the contribution of the MALDM&#13;
to the District Farming Systems Teams, for incremental operating costs. In addition to&#13;
expanding the collaborative on-farm research with individual farmers, KARI would work&#13;
with the extension service to develop arrangements for on-farm research involving farmer&#13;
groups and associations, also on a cost-sharing basis. The coordination of all activities of&#13;
the RRCs rests with the recently appointed assistant director for regional research centers&#13;
at KARI Headquarters.&#13;
4.16  Crop Research. The project will finance the applied (problem-oriented) research&#13;
program on high-priority commodities which will be implemented through the NRCs, in&#13;
collaboration with RRCs. In the case of crops, KARI will increase its focus on food crops&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
such as maize, wheat, sorghum, barley, grain legumes, and root/tuber crops. Particular&#13;
attention will be devoted to making improved varieties available and development of&#13;
superior, location-specific and cost-effective cultural management practices. NARP II&#13;
would provide support to repair the internal roads in the research centers in Muguga,&#13;
Kitale, Kisii, and Naivasha and improve the water supply system of the NRC at Njoro.&#13;
Training, technical assistance, vehicles, additional office, field and laboratory equipment,&#13;
and financing for incremental, operating costs would be provided for selected programs.&#13;
For cash crops such as pyrethrum, cotton, oilseeds and horticultural crops such as fruits,&#13;
vegetables and flowers, KARI would expand its efforts to shift the research burden to the&#13;
private sector (paras. 3.8-3.11). Negotiations, some in an advanced stage, are on-going&#13;
with private sector industry groups (cotton, sugar, pyrethrum, etc..) to agree on the scope,&#13;
arrangements and timetable for the concerned industry to take responsibility for research.&#13;
4.17  Livestock Research. In livestock, efforts will focus on high priority aspects of&#13;
animal production and health research on dairy cattle, beef cattle, poultry, and small&#13;
ruminants (sheep and goats), as well as on pasture and fodder crops and range&#13;
management. For animal health, the consolidation of national programs, which started&#13;
with viral and protozoan diseases through the establishment of liaison mechanisms&#13;
between KARI and the Veterinary Department of MALDM, will be extended to cover&#13;
other major livestock diseases. Nationally coordinated programs in all priority disciplines&#13;
(virology, bacteriology, protozoology, helminthology, entomology/acarology, and&#13;
epidemiology) are being established.&#13;
4.18  Support for these programs, primarily financing for incremental operating costs,&#13;
would be provided under NARP II. Another element in animal health will be the&#13;
dissemination of processes (e.g., for diagnosis) and inputs (mainly vaccines) to farmers. In&#13;
particular, KARI has developed a vaccine for East Coast Fever (ECF) in cattle and&#13;
another for Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP) in goats which are to be&#13;
validated in field trials and introduced through a pilot program with participating farrners&#13;
and private veterinarians.&#13;
4.19   Natural Resource Management Research. The conservation and management&#13;
of the natural resource base, maintaining (and, where possible, expanding) the productive&#13;
potential, and the development of sustainable farming systems, are among the highest&#13;
national priorities. Soil fertility management is a key to the intensification of agriculture.&#13;
Soil fertility research and advisory services would be strengthened under the project. The&#13;
capacity for soil testing and plant tissue analysis, and for providing advice to the extension&#13;
service and to farmers on a full cost-recovery basis, will be pilot-tested in two RRCs&#13;
located at Kakamega and Mtwapa. The fertilizer use and recommendations program,&#13;
supported by the EU, will be closely linked with this effort. The project would provide&#13;
support in the form of training, equipment and financing for the incremental operating&#13;
costs of the two pilot RRCs. It was confirmed at negotiations that soil and tissue analyses&#13;
services are being provided on a full cost-recovery basis, in accordance with agreed&#13;
arrangements (para. 7. ig). Soil and water conservation research will be continued with&#13;
SIDA funding. Research on small-scale water harvesting, irrigation, and drainage would&#13;
also be supported under the project, with an emphasis on reviewing experience with small-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
scale schemes in different agroclimatic zones and socioeconomic settings, to produce&#13;
recommendations on the most successful approaches.&#13;
4.20  Socioeconomics Research. Substantial constraints to the adoption of improved&#13;
technology still exist in the policy environment, and the policy issues require more&#13;
intensive review to prepare recommendations for consideration by Government. These&#13;
areas have been assigned to KARl's socioeconomic research program. The&#13;
socioeconomic perspective also needs to be incorporated more fully into the periodic&#13;
review and adjustment of research priorities. In addition, KARI's capacity for the&#13;
evaluation of research programs (including ex-post impact studies) needs to be expanded.&#13;
Strengthened leadership of the socioeconomic research program is being established at&#13;
KARI headquarters (including the establishment of a new Socioeconomic Division), to&#13;
support the work at the NRCs and RRCs.&#13;
4.21   Biotechnology. The application of biotechnology is opening up new opportunities&#13;
for accelerated agricultural development in many areas. The financing required to give&#13;
KARI access to biotechnology applications is included in the crops and livestock research&#13;
components. To ensure the safe development and use of biotechnology products, the&#13;
Kenya National Council for Science and Technology is finalizing the National Biosafety&#13;
Guidelines. NARP II would provide start-up support for downstream research which&#13;
would allow KARI to access and utilize biotechnologies, with the expectation of increased&#13;
support from other donors later on.&#13;
4.22  Agricultural Research Fund. Under NARP I, the ARF has provided research&#13;
grants to both individual researchers and teams of researchers, external to KARI, for a&#13;
variety of priority research topics defined by KARI. The success of this funding&#13;
mechanism as a cost-effective means to promote and support well-focused research,&#13;
together with the positive experiences of simnilar mechanisms in other countries provides&#13;
the rationale for the expanded support for the ARF under NARP II. Important changes to&#13;
be introduced under the project in the policies and operations of the ARF are: (i) an&#13;
expanded scope and incentive structure involving matching grants to attract multi-donor&#13;
and private agro-industry funding, (ii) expanded coverage to include research by KARI&#13;
scientists as well as by universities, private sector agencies, international institutions and&#13;
individuals, and (iii) a revised ranking system for the award of grants which favors those&#13;
proposals that seek to achieve synergy through team effort, collaboration among&#13;
institutions, and links with Universities, particularly the involvement of post-graduate&#13;
students in the research projects. The revised ARF also provides an attractive means by&#13;
which the private sector/industry can contract research, by offering a transparent and&#13;
competitive system of research grant award, accounting, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Other incentives for such collaboration are: (i) the provision for the ARF to give matching&#13;
grants for funds provided by the private sector, and (ii) the absence of any proprietary&#13;
rights over the technologies/varieties developed using funds from the ARF.&#13;
4.23   The ARF will operate under a restructured management committee, with a panel&#13;
of technical reviewers. It will be supported by a secretariat provided by KARI (para S. 7).&#13;
An amount of about US$4.0 mnillion equivalent would be provided from the IDA Credit to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
fund the operations of the ARF. KARI would deposit from the IDA Credit to the&#13;
Paymaster General (PMG) account for the ARF, an amount not exceeding US$100,000&#13;
equivalent, to cover eligible expenditures. A manual of ARF policies, organization, and&#13;
procedures has been adopted by KARI's Board (para. 7.2h). The manual would not be&#13;
substantially modified without the prior agreement of IDA and other concerned donors.&#13;
During negotiations assurances were obtained that the ARE policies, procedures and core&#13;
membership of its management committee would not be changed without the agreement of&#13;
IDA (para. 7. 1h).&#13;
Seeds Program&#13;
4.24  Pilot Seed Program. The availability of good quality seed and planting materials&#13;
has been a major constraint to exploiting the country's agricultural potential. Although&#13;
many initiatives have been undertaken, a viable national seed system has not yet emerged.&#13;
A program to establish such a system has been prepared by a task force on seeds&#13;
appointed by MALDM. The task force has recommending appropriate policy guidelines,&#13;
legislation and regulations and defined the respective roles of the public and private&#13;
sectors. Based on these recommendations, KARI would develop a plan for implementing&#13;
a pilot seed program involving the formal and informal seed production and distribution&#13;
sectors. The pilot seed program will provide insights into the implementation of the&#13;
recently issued seed liberalization policy of the Government.&#13;
4.25   The main feature of the program is the production of breeder and foundation seed&#13;
by financially-autonomous FSUs at selected KARI centers, while commercial seed will be&#13;
produced by the private sector (both formal and informal). A National Seeds&#13;
Development Committee (NSDC), expanded in membership to include all important&#13;
stakeholders and with MALDM in an advisory role, will guide the development of the&#13;
seed system. Quality assurance will be provided by MALDM through the National Seed&#13;
Quality Control Service. KARI will strengthen its basic/foundation seeds multiplication&#13;
program through the establishment of the organizational structure, including the&#13;
appointment of a full-time manager of the Seed Coordination Unit. Start-up activities for&#13;
two pilot Foundation Seed Units (FSUs) will be initiated upon appointment of the&#13;
manager. Additional FSUs would be established during the course of the project. KARIs&#13;
establishment of arrangements, satisfactory to the Association, for the organizational&#13;
structure of the Seeds Coordination Unit, including the appointment of its Manager,&#13;
would be a condition for Credit effectiveness (para. 7.2c).&#13;
4.26  The project would support the seeds program by providing seed processing and&#13;
other field equipment, vehicles, training and technical assistance, and financing of&#13;
incremental operating costs. The Government's Macroeconomic and Structural Policy&#13;
Frameworkfor 1995-1997) and the Letter of Sectoral Policy on Agricultural Research&#13;
(para. 2.10) recognize the need to improve the seed industry in operation in Kenya. The&#13;
Letter of Sectoral Policy on Agricultural Research was provided to the Association by the&#13;
Government during negotiations. Among the actions which have been taken by the&#13;
Government in this regard are: (i) full liberalization of the seed sub-sector, and (ii) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
issuance of a policy statement allowing for production and trade of all seeds and planting&#13;
materials by MALDM-approved seed producers and traders. Actions still to be taken by&#13;
the Government include (i) establishment of financially self-sustaining seed units at KARI&#13;
research centers based on the sale of breeder and basic/foundation seeds to private sector&#13;
seed companies and farmer seed producers, and (ii) improvement of public plant&#13;
quarantine services to facilitate the import and export of seeds. The latter would involve&#13;
the establishment of the Kenya Plant Health Inspection Service (KEPHIS) under the&#13;
MALDM and transfer of the plant quarantine service from KARI to KEPHIS. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that KEPHIS would be established, and seed certification&#13;
would be optional for the informal seed sector, particularly for farmers who exchange&#13;
seeds on a non-commercial basis (para. 7. li).&#13;
D. PROJEcT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
4.27   A summary of estimated project costs is presented in Table 4.1. (Details of project&#13;
costs are given in Annex 2.) A physical contingency of 10 percent has been added to the&#13;
base cost of fixed investments. The international price contingency is based on the Index&#13;
of Unit Value of Manufactured Exports, and the contingency for domestic prices is based&#13;
on the projected inflation rate.3 A constant purchasing parity exchange rate has been used&#13;
to convert domestic costs into US$ equivalent (with Kenya's liberalized exchange rate&#13;
regime, this assumption is considered appropriate). All costs are net of duties and taxes.&#13;
3 For international prices, the projected inflation rates are 1.8 percent for 1996, 2.6 percent for 1997,&#13;
and 2.5 percent for 1998-2000; for domestic prices, the rates are 7.5 percent for 1996 and 5 percent&#13;
thereafter.&#13;

4.28    The total project cost is US$179.9 million equivalent, including physical and price&#13;
contingencies of $7.1 and $8.7 million, respectively. The IDA Credit which would be&#13;
passed on by the Government as a grant to KARI would be SDR 27.4 million (US$39.7&#13;
million equivalent), of which $14.9 million would be for institution building, $20.6 million&#13;
for research programs and $4.2 million for the seed program. The signing of the Grant&#13;
Agreement would be a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 7.2a). The Government&#13;
of Kenya would provide US$70.4 million equivalent of which about $64.7 million would&#13;
be for institution building (of which $58.0 million would be for salaries), $5.0 million for&#13;
research programs and $0.7 million for the seeds program. The private sector is estimated&#13;
to contribute US$6.9 million equivalent to finance research programs in cotton,&#13;
horticulture, rice, sugar and pyrethrum. Other donors (EU, GON, UK/ODA, SIDA and&#13;
USAID) have committed to provide the rest of the required financing of about US$62.9&#13;
million equivalent. In order to ensure sustained technology generation and dissemination,&#13;
the Governrment would finance an increasing proportion of incremental operating costs,&#13;
rising from 25 percent in the first year to 50 percent in the fifth year of the project period.&#13;
An assurance was made by the Government that its contribution to project financing&#13;
would be provided in a timely manner, in accordance with the annual work plans and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

E. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.29  IDA guidelines for procurement would be followed on the use of IDA funds&#13;
regardless of the percentage of financing provided by IDA for a particular procurement&#13;
package. Procurement financed by other donors would follow the procurement&#13;
procedures of those donors. The Bank's standard bidding and contract documents would&#13;
be used for all International Competitive Bids (ICB) and consulting services. Procurement&#13;
of works, goods, and services would be in accordance with the Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995); consultants would be&#13;
retained in accordance with the Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers (August, 1981). The allocation of project cost and IDA financing by&#13;
procurement method is presented in Table 4.3.&#13;
4.30  Civil Works. Contracts estimated to cost US$1.0 million or more, aggregating up&#13;
to US$3.0 million, would be procured through ICB; below this level, aggregating up to&#13;
US$4.2 million, through National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Civil works to be&#13;
constructed under the project would be facilities and improvement of access roads at&#13;
KARI research centers and headquarters. Consulting firms to be appointed by KARI&#13;
would supervise all engineering, design and construction of these works.&#13;
4.31   Goods. Equipment consisting of office, laboratory and field equipment, audio&#13;
visual and radio equipment, survey instruments, computing equipment, and vehicles would&#13;
be procured through ICB. These equipment would be grouped into cost-effective&#13;
packages of US$100,000 or more to an aggregate amount of US$5.7 million). Contracts&#13;
estimated to cost below US$ 100,000 to an aggregate amount of US$500,000 would be&#13;
procured through NCB. Items including scientific consumables (reagents, test tubes,&#13;
flasks, etc.), office firniture and small items of equipment packaged in contracts of&#13;
US$20,000 or less, and not to exceed an aggregate amount of US$500,000 would be&#13;
purchased through International/National Shopping procedures in accordance with IDA&#13;
guidelines. Eligible domestic manufacturers would receive a margin of preference of up to&#13;
15 percent CIF price according to IDA procurement guidelines. All ICB procurement will&#13;
require IDA's prior review. NCB procurement over US$100,000 equivalent for goods&#13;
and US$500,000 equivalent for civil works is also subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
National or International Shopping will be subject to SOE disbursement procedures and&#13;
IDA's ex-post review in the field (para. 4.38). Contract documentation will be selected&#13;
for ex-post review at random during supervision missions.&#13;

Others: Local shopping, procedures for recriitment of consultants and for training, etc.&#13;
4.32   Consultant Services and Training. Terms of reference for all consultant services&#13;
would be subject to prior review by IDA. When the estimated value of the contract&#13;
exceeds US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals, selection procedures, short&#13;
lists, and draft contracts also would be subject to prior review. The list of long-term and&#13;
short-term consultants required for project preparation/implementation support and&#13;
capacity building is given in Annex 9. Two long-term consultants, for the seed program&#13;
(36 person months) and for farming systems research (24 person-months) would be&#13;
required. The rest would be short-term consultants of not more than 9 person months&#13;
duration. Whenever possible, contracts for consultancies would include reference to&#13;
training of counterparts. Foreign and local training will be procured by KARI subject to&#13;
agreed procedures according to a training master plan requiring approval by IDA. In- -&#13;
service training would be emphasized, including short-term courses in priority areas such&#13;
as research management, research center operations, research methodology, specially for&#13;
socioeconomic research, and monitoring and evaluation. Support for a small number of&#13;
post-graduate degree training, largely to the MSc degree at local universities also would&#13;
be provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
4.33  Agricultural Research Fund Contracts. Adaptive research proposals would&#13;
generally cost less than US$40,000 equivalent but the ARF could provide research grants&#13;
of up to a maximum of US$ 100,000 equivalent. Research grants would finance operating&#13;
costs with the exception of building maintenance, and for hiring equipment, e.g. tractors&#13;
for land preparation. Disbursements from the ARF will be through a PMG account&#13;
established for the purpose (paras. 4.23 and 4.40). Guidelines for the ARF are given in&#13;
the ARF Manual approved by KARI's Board of Management. The main features of the&#13;
ARF are provided in Annex 10.&#13;
4.34 Annual Procurement Work Program and Procurement Monitoring. An&#13;
overall Annual Procurement Work Program (APWP) would be prepared by KARI by&#13;
April 1 of each year, in consultation with research centers which would implement the&#13;
project. The APWP would contain details with respect to each research center on: (i)&#13;
items to be procured and expenditure category; (ii) procurement packages; (iii) estimated&#13;
cost per package; and (iv) the implementation schedule for procurement. The training&#13;
plan, including budget, implementation schedule and other details would be incorporated&#13;
as part of the APWP.&#13;
4.35 KARI would prepare a Semi-Annual Procurement Progress Report (SPPR) to be&#13;
submitted within 30 days after the end of June and December. IDA shall provide KARI&#13;
with a suitable format for reporting procurement of works and goods during the project&#13;
launch workshop. The SPPR would inter alia contain the following information:&#13;
a)    Awarded contracts: (i) project component or subcomponent, (ii) contract&#13;
number and date, (iii) method of procurement, (iv) name of country of the&#13;
successful bidder, (v) value and currency of the contract, (vi) major&#13;
expenditure category, and (vii) expected and actual date of contract&#13;
completion, or expected and actual date of receipt of goods.&#13;
b)    Procurement in process: (i) project component or subcomponent, (ii)&#13;
procurement package and total funds allocated, (iii) planned and actual&#13;
dates of inviting bids, (iv) date of opening of bids, (v) date of planned and&#13;
actual submission of bid evaluation report to IDA, (vi) date cleared by&#13;
IDA, and (vii) date of award of contract, name of contractor, supplier or&#13;
consultant and value of the contract.&#13;
c)    Procurement processing time. At negotiations, standard processing time -&#13;
for procurement activities was agreed upon with GOK and incorporated in&#13;
the APWP.&#13;
4.36  Procurement Review. The IDA Credit would finance around 44 percent of&#13;
works, 33 percent of goods and equipment, and 21 percent of consultant services and&#13;
training, requiring prior review by IDA. Prior review by IDA is required for civil works&#13;
contracts estimated to cost over US$500,000 equivalent and for goods, over US$100,000&#13;
equivalent. All sole source contracts would be subject to prior review by IDA, regardless&#13;
of the amount of the contract. This review would be supplemented by the annual audit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
which will review procurement practices, a comprehensive examination at the nid-term of&#13;
the project, and random reviews during supervision. A list and schedule of important&#13;
contracts for works, goods, and consultant services is given in Annex 5.&#13;
F. DISBURSENENT&#13;
4.37   The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 27.4 million would be disbursed over a period&#13;
of 5 years, with an expected project completion date of December 31, 2001 and a closing&#13;
date of June 30, 2002. The schedule of estimated disbursements is based on the standard&#13;
profile for Kenya agriculture investment operations and is summarized in Table 4.4 below.&#13;
Details are given in Annex 2.&#13;

Total                            39.7&#13;
4.38   Disbursements would be against standard IDA documentation, except in the&#13;
following cases, for which statements of expenditure (SOEs) would be utilized: (i)&#13;
contracts for goods up to US$100,000 equivalent, (ii) contracts for civil works up to&#13;
US$500,000 equivalent, (iii) ARF contracts up to US$50,000 equivalent, (iv) foreign&#13;
training up to US$30,000, (iv) local training, and (v) operating costs. For consultant&#13;
services the SOE procedure could be used for contracts of up to US$100,000 equivalent for&#13;
firms and US$50,000 equivalent for individuals. SOEs would be certified by the Director of&#13;
Finance of KARI and the Director, External Resources Department of the Ministry of&#13;
Finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
4.39  Supporting documentation would be retained by KARI for at least one year after&#13;
receipt by IDA of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made.&#13;
This documentation would be made available for review by the auditors and by visiting&#13;
IDA staff upon request. Disbursements would be made in accordance with the Guidelines&#13;
for Withdrawal of Proceeds of IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. For ARF Grant Contracts&#13;
which do not fall under the SOE threshold, the initial advance would be used as&#13;
supporting documentation, with relevant documentation to be forwarded to the Bank by&#13;
KARI when available.&#13;
4.40  Special Account. To expedite the disbursement of funds, the GOK would&#13;
establish a Special Account for the Project to cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures.&#13;
The authorized amount of the Special Account of the project would be US$2.0 million,&#13;
representing an average of three months expenditures. Withdrawals from the Special&#13;
Account would be replenished monthly in accordance with established IDA disbursement&#13;
procedures. The minimum withdrawal application size for replenishing the Special&#13;
Account would be US$200,000 equivalent, representing 10 percent of the initial deposit.&#13;
Documentation requirements for replenishment applications would be the same as&#13;
described in para. 4.38. In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Account&#13;
would accompany all replenishment requests. Recovery of the initial deposit would&#13;
commence within 6 months of the project's closing date or when the total unwithdrawn&#13;
amount of the Credit equals US$2.0 million or when the Credit remains inactive for more&#13;
than 6 months. Records of the Special Account proceeds and expenditures would be kept&#13;
by KARI. The Special Account would be audited in accordance with the project auditing&#13;
arrangements (paras. 5.11 and 7.2e). At negotiations, its was agreed that in the unlikely&#13;
event that the Special Account does not operate in a timely manner as envisaged and&#13;
implementation of on-going research programs is adversely affected, IDA and the&#13;
Government would immediately discuss the matter and take necessary remedial measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
5.1   KARI would have primary responsibility for implementation of the project. Since&#13;
the project would support the entire second phase of KARI's corporate development&#13;
program, it would be implemented through KARI's regular institutional structure (without&#13;
a separate project unit). Coordination would be provided by the Director General,&#13;
through the Office of Donor Coordination. KARI's participation in the seeds program&#13;
would be guided by its Seeds Coordination Unit. Details on implementation arrangements&#13;
are provided in the Project Implementation Plan (Annex 4). The implementation plan for&#13;
the first two years of the project was discussed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
A. INSTITUTION BUILDING&#13;
5.2   KARI operates under the general guidance of a Board of Management, which sets&#13;
policy and takes decisions on major operations on the basis of proposals submitted by&#13;
management. The Board is currently chaired by a representative of the seed industry and&#13;
is composed of 20 members: 12 ex-officio and 8 members appointed by MRTTT. Chief&#13;
executive responsibility resides with a Director General, who is assisted by a Director of&#13;
Research and a Director of Administration. Under the Director of Research is an&#13;
Assistant Director for Crops, an Assistant Director for Livestock and five other Assistant&#13;
Directors for disciplinary research areas who provide technical oversight. The Directors&#13;
of the NRCs report to the relevant Assistant Directors while Directors of RRCs report to&#13;
the Assistant Director for regional research (Charts I and 2). A Donor Coordination Unit&#13;
is being established in the Office of the Director General to serve as a focus for relations&#13;
with external financiers, integrated program planning and coordination. A Library&#13;
Documentation and Information Unit has been established to improve and oversee the&#13;
institute's information system. This organizational structure, as well as the functions,&#13;
procedures, duties and responsibilities of staff, and terms and conditions of service, are&#13;
specified in an Organization &amp; Management Manual which is satisfactory to IDA. At&#13;
negotiations, assurance was given that KARI would operate in accordance with this&#13;
manual, which would be modified from time to time in agreement with IDA (para. 7. lj).&#13;
5.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) of KARI's research activities is undertaken by&#13;
the M&amp;E Team under the Director of Research. The broad objective is to have a system&#13;
which contributes to improving research management and accountability. Specific&#13;
objectives include: (i) identifying and prioritizing information needs of KARI management,&#13;
(ii) providing such information in a timely manner for decision making, (iii) addressing&#13;
social and gender issues, and (iv) documenting the relevant research results generated by&#13;
KARI and evaluating their effectiveness and impact on increasing the production and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
incomes of smallholder farmiers. The socioeconomics unit will undertake the economic&#13;
and impact evaluation of research projects of the NRCs and RRCs.&#13;
B. RESEARCH PROGRAMS&#13;
5.4   Regional research to adapt technology for on-farm adoption in different agro-&#13;
ecological zones is carried out by the network of 10 RRCs. Each Research Center has a&#13;
Center Research Advisory Committee (CRAC) and a Center Technical Committee (CTC)&#13;
which ensure that research proposals are consistent with the national/regional priority&#13;
structure, respond to stakeholder needs, and are technically sound. The membership of&#13;
the regional CRAC comprise the RRC Director as chairman, and representatives of&#13;
farmers' organizations, NGOs, agro-industries and exporters, extension workers and staff&#13;
of the RRC. For NRCs, the CRACs are chaired by the relevant Assistant Director; they&#13;
have similar members as the RRC. Directors of relevant NRCs and RRCs are invited to&#13;
participate. Proposals approved by these committees are submitted to the Research&#13;
Coordinating Committee (RCC) at KARI headquarters for consideration. Applied&#13;
research on commodities, factors of production, and disciplines is undertaken by the&#13;
network of 15 NRCs (of which 5 are combined NRC/RRCs). KARI would prepare annual&#13;
work programs (AWPs), including procurement plans for funding by IDA. Assurance was&#13;
obtained at negotiations that the Annual Work Programs and related financing plans&#13;
would be submitted for review by IDA by March 15 of each year (para. 7. 1k).&#13;
5.5   Expanding on existing arrangements, and benefiting from experience with tea and&#13;
coffee, responsibility for research on other cash crops would be transferred to the private&#13;
sector over the course of the project. The private sector has now assumed responsibility&#13;
for sugar research, and that for pyrethrum, cotton, and oilseeds would be transferred in&#13;
accordance with agreed plans. In the case of staple crops, participation of farmers in on-&#13;
farm adaptive research would be expanded to include farmer groups and associations.&#13;
5.6   Various International Agricultural Research Centers (1ARCs) have operated&#13;
successful research networks across Africa which have facilitated researcher training, as&#13;
well as collaboration and information exchange with the national agricultural research&#13;
systems (NARSs). Collaborative arrangements with these IARCs and those activities&#13;
carried out under the auspices of the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research&#13;
in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA) are being incorporated into KARI's priority&#13;
research programs, according to the needs and to the contributions that these centers can&#13;
provide.&#13;
5.7   The Agricultural Research Fund is directed by the ARF Management Committee&#13;
(ARFMC), with members appointed by the KARI Board of Management. ARFMC is&#13;
chaired by the Director of KARI and is composed of two representatives from the private&#13;
sector, three from the research and university community, and two from the public sector.&#13;
The ARFMC sets guidelines for the operation of the ARF and approves grant awards&#13;
within the overall policy framework set by the KARI Board. A full-time Secretariat&#13;
located at KARI Headquarters will provide support to the ARFMC and manage day-to-&#13;
day operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
C. SEEDS PROGRAM&#13;
5.8   The seeds program would be implemented within the framework of the National&#13;
Seeds Development Policy and under the guidance of the National Seeds Development&#13;
Committee (NSDC), chaired by MALDM and comprising representatives from the fornal&#13;
and informal seed sector, KARI and MALDM. The National Seed Quality Control&#13;
Service and the Kenya Plant Health Inspection System of MALDM would provide quality&#13;
assurance. KARI's participation in the program would be guided by its Seeds&#13;
Coordinating Unit and implemented by the Foundation Seed Units (FSUs) to be&#13;
established at selected RRCs. Commercial seed would be produced by firms and&#13;
individuals, using foundation seed procured from the FSUs or obtained from other&#13;
sources. Qualified farmers, farmer associations, and NGOs also would procure foundation&#13;
seeds from KARI and multiply these for sale as certified or non-certified seed.&#13;
D. KEY IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS INDICATORS&#13;
5.9   The overriding objectives of NARP II are to make agricultural research relevant&#13;
and to make scientists accountable for results. The elements to achieve this include the&#13;
expansion of the ARF, the reorganization of KARI, the introduction of operating manuals,&#13;
the evaluation of the performance of scientists, the nomination of key staff, the&#13;
implementation of a program-based accounting system, and the revision of research&#13;
programs to conform to priorities set. Project objectives would be translated into key&#13;
monitorable indicators for each year of project implementation (Annex 6). These would&#13;
include indicators for (i) development impact, e.g., adoption rate, yield increase, and client&#13;
participation; (ii) implementation progress, e.g., institution building, procurement, training;&#13;
and (iii) financial performance, e.g., Government funding, disbursement of IDA and other&#13;
donors, and KARI's financial management status. Progress would be tracked by KARI's&#13;
M&amp;E Unit and reviewed through regular IDA supervision missions.&#13;
E. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, AND PROGRESS REPORTING&#13;
5.10 Accounting. KARI would maintain records and accounts in accordance with&#13;
Kenyan and international accounting standards. Separate accounts and records,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, would be maintained for the ARF. Annual financial statements&#13;
(income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow) identifying project transactions would be&#13;
prepared for KARI and separately for ARF. The unaudited financial statements for both&#13;
KARI and ARF would be submitted to IDA within three months after the end of each&#13;
fiscal year.&#13;
5.11  Auditing. The accounts and financial statements (including the Special Account&#13;
and SOEs) for KARI and ARF would be audited in accordance with the Kenyan and&#13;
international standards on auditing, by independent auditors which in this case would be&#13;
the Auditor General (Corporations) or other private auditors, acceptable to IDA,&#13;
appointed by and operating under the supervision of the Auditor General (Corporations).&#13;
The audit reports, including specific references to the Special Accounts and separate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
opinions on the SOEs and ARF, and incorporating management letters, would be&#13;
submitted to IDA within six months after the close of each fiscal year (para. 7. l).&#13;
5.12 Progress Reports and Mid-Term Review. Progress reports would be prepared&#13;
by KARI on a semi-annual basis, in accordance with the format contained in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual (PIM), and submitted to IDA within 30 days of the end of each&#13;
semester. A mid-term review of project progress and impact would be undertaken by&#13;
KARI, IDA and other donors by December 1998. To facilitate this review, KARI would&#13;
prepare a status report of the project and submit it to IDA at least three months prior to&#13;
the date of the review. Three months before the closing date, the Government would&#13;
prepare and provide to IDA its own evaluation of the project, in accordance with agreed&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
F. SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
5.13  A project launch workshop would be organized in March 1997, for which full&#13;
participation of all donors would be sought. This first workshop would include all&#13;
managers, including Program Heads and Center Directors. Immediately thereafter,&#13;
separate launch workshops would be organized at each research center, which would also&#13;
include key extension staff and members of the regional research advisory comnmittee. A&#13;
mid-term review would be carried out (para. 5.12). The focus of subsequent progress&#13;
reviews would be the research priority setting process, the implementation priority&#13;
research programs, the restructuring program (especially the reduction of non-essential&#13;
staff, redeployment of staff, and rationalization of the center network), the operations of&#13;
the Special Account arrangements, and functioning of the budget process, especially the&#13;
release of funds and provisions for recurrent operating costs. Expertise (local and foreign)&#13;
in agricultural research, institutional development, and financial management would be&#13;
incorporated into the joint progress review process, as appropriate. A detailed supervision&#13;
plan is given in Annex 11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
Facilitating Overall Growth&#13;
6.1   The project supports the Government's development strategy and is well&#13;
embedded in IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The Government has recently&#13;
completed a review of the Agricultural Sector which was done in conjunction with work&#13;
on an Agricultural Sector Memorandum by the Bank. The sector strategy that is evolving&#13;
clearly recognizes that rapid and sustained growth in agriculture is essential to ensure&#13;
continued overall economic growth, employment creation and poverty reduction. If these&#13;
objectives are to be achieved, Kenyan agriculture will have to undergo a structural&#13;
transformation of smallholder farms from a subsistence orientation to a farm enterprise&#13;
orientation; this would also require accelerating change in the mix of farming activities to&#13;
those which result in more value added per unit of land and labor. The role of research in&#13;
this process is crucial. The challenge is not just to maintain high growth rates in land&#13;
productivity, but rather to actually increase growth rates in yields without sacrificing the&#13;
long-term productive capacity of the natural resource base. There are already indications&#13;
that this capacity is being compromised in the highlands with nutrient losses significantly&#13;
exceeding nutrient inputs. Moreover, soil erosion has become a major problem in some&#13;
agricultural highland districts. The task is thus to intensify land use while enhancing the&#13;
long-term productive capacity of the soil and water resource base. This can only come&#13;
about through effective agricultural research that produces new technologies and practices&#13;
to meet the needs of Kenya's farmers; establishing a sustainable framework to allow this to&#13;
happen would be an important project benefit.&#13;
6.2   The macroeconomic and sectoral conditions are generally favorable to allow the&#13;
project to have a positive impact on agricultural growth. Kenya has maintained a&#13;
relatively stable macroeconomic environment over the past year and the benefits are&#13;
beginning to filter through to agriculture. In addition, domestic and international market&#13;
demand will remain buoyant for the main commodities produced domestically. From a&#13;
sectoral perspective the Government's agricultural strategy recognizes that an appropriate&#13;
policy environment which sends consistent and credible signals to the market has to be in&#13;
place and the Government has taken steps to complete the policy agenda (para. 2.10-&#13;
2.11). The Government's strategy also recognizes that the institutional framework has to&#13;
be readjusted and emphasizes that the reform of the operations of the public sector will&#13;
help to release resources that can be used for higher-priority tasks. Efforts to restructure&#13;
MALDM is already under way, being supported under ASMP II. A key element of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Govenmment's strategy is the rationalization of the provision of support services in line&#13;
with the strategic directions for smallholder agriculture. Research is a key support activity&#13;
and this project is designed to assist in achieving the above aim.&#13;
Making Strategic Choices&#13;
6.3    A major achievement of NARP II would be to put in place a system in which&#13;
strategic choices on technology development can be made. The aim would be to focus&#13;
research undertaken by KARI using public funds to very specific areas largely limited to&#13;
basic food crops and livestock research. The rationale for establishing priorities would&#13;
clearly focus on supporting research largely of a public good nature for which private&#13;
sources of funds would generally not be available or are not available at the present time&#13;
as the industries have not yet developed. At the same time and over the life of the project,&#13;
the aim would be to transfer the burden for financing research on industrial/export crops&#13;
to the private sector, i.e., to industry associations and to the farmers themselves.&#13;
6.4   Following the above principle, KARI would continue to focus primarily on&#13;
commodities destined for domestic consumption, with responsibility for research on&#13;
export and other industrial crops, e.g. pyrethrum, sugar, cotton, being increasingly&#13;
assumed by the private sector. Even within food crops there is the recognition that while&#13;
agricultural growth will depend on increasing the commercialization of agriculture, there&#13;
are crops that can increase the stability of food supplies, such as sorghum and cassava&#13;
particularly for the poor. Research aimed at enhancing food security would continue to&#13;
remain a public function.&#13;
6.5   The project will also aim to improve post harvest handling and processing. The&#13;
basic rationale here is that just decreasing the costs of production may not lead to&#13;
improved market prospects for a commodity. Developing new products (e.g., for&#13;
cassava), new processing methods (e.g., for sorghum, groundnut, and sunflower seed) or&#13;
new handling methods (e.g., for bananas and fruits and vegetables) may be as important as&#13;
improved production technology. The food processing industry in Kenya is still at a very&#13;
nascent stage of development and, therefore, is still unable to finance significant research&#13;
into these aspects. The project would investigate these issues on a commodity-by-&#13;
conmmodity basis and any promising developments would be made available to the food&#13;
processing industry for further development.&#13;
6.6   The third research focus supported by the project would be to examine the&#13;
extemalities involved with the agricultural strategy and to come up with mitigating&#13;
actions. Agricultural growth in Kenya depends on substantial increases in land&#13;
productivity. However, agriculture is an extractive industry, especially in terms of soil&#13;
nutrients. Extraction rates increase in direct relation to enhanced production, and the rates&#13;
of nutrient raining in Kenya are already high and unsustainable. The increased and&#13;
effective utilization of chemnical and organic fertilizer will have to be a key component of&#13;
future agricultural growth. Formulation of strategies to promote this, based on solid&#13;
research would be a major benefit of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
6.7    Evidence from ex-post analysis shows that investment in agricultural research, in&#13;
both developed and developing countries, generates high returns, exceeding 40 percent in&#13;
most cases.4 A Bank-organized cross-country comparison of East and West African&#13;
countries suggests that similar returns have been obtained in many of these countries. The&#13;
study concludes that investments in research are justifiable, particularly when coupled with&#13;
an ongoing extension effort. This conclusion is underscored by a study on the impact of&#13;
maize research across five African countries5, as well as by a study on the Kenyan6&#13;
situation; where the returns were 40 to 60 percent on maize, and 33 percent on wheat&#13;
research. The development of the dual purpose (for milk and meat production) goat in&#13;
Kenya showed that incomes of farmers growing these type of goats increased by as much&#13;
as 60 percent.&#13;
6.8    The calculation of an economic rate of return (ERR) for the project as a whole is&#13;
constrained by data limitations. The technology improvements that will be developed, the&#13;
rate and extent of their adoption by farmers, and the productivity and output gains due to&#13;
their application cannot be accurately predicted and are likely to vary significantly among&#13;
agroecological zones. Benefits from improved technologies could also be influenced by&#13;
external factors like the availability of agricultural inputs and the efficiency of the&#13;
marketing and distribution system. A limited economic analysis focusing on determining&#13;
the benefits from research on food grains ( maize, wheat, sorghum and millet) was&#13;
attempted as described below. The analysis confirms that the economic benefits from&#13;
research is considerable.&#13;
6.9   Full details of the economic analysis is provided in Annex 14. Benefits from food&#13;
grains research was assumed to accrue for the first time in Year 6, the year immediately&#13;
following the closing date of the project. The benefits were derived by assuming that&#13;
maize yields would increase from an average of about 1.0 ton per hectare to about 1.8&#13;
tons per hectare, in a ten year span; yields of wheat would increase from 2.0 tons to 2.3&#13;
tons per hectare, and yields of sorghum and millet would increase from 0.4 to 0.6 tons per&#13;
hectare. The adoption rate of improved food grains technology developed under NARP II&#13;
would increase from 2.5 percent in Year 6 to 37 percent in Year 10, and remain constant&#13;
thereafter. The adoption rates used in the calculations are quite conservative considering&#13;
that where hybrids/improved varieties have been introduced in Kenya, and seeds are&#13;
available, adoption rates of up to 90 percent have been observed. The assumed yield&#13;
increases are also conservative, representing less than 50 percent of yields in developed&#13;
countries and in researcher managed trials in Kenya. The incremental production of food&#13;
grains would substitute for imports, and is valued economically at US$180 per ton. It is&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
further assumed that the incremental costs of production of the food grains would be&#13;
equivalent to 40 percent of the incremental value of production (value:cost ratio of 2.5).&#13;
6.10  The analysis shows that research on food grains would yield an ERR of 24 percent,&#13;
while the net present value ( NPV) of food grains research based on a 15 year cash flow,&#13;
discounted at the opportunity cost of capital, or OCC (12 percent), would amount to&#13;
about US$70 million. The ERR is robust under various sensitivity scenarios. The&#13;
switching values show that benefits from food grains research could go down by 61&#13;
percent or costs to increase by 155 percent and the ERR would still be equal to the OCC&#13;
or 12 percent.&#13;
6.11  The economic analysis shows that the overall ERR of the project, calculated by&#13;
allowing for total project costs (including the costs of cotton, oil crops, horticultural&#13;
crops, livestock and natural resource management research) and using only the benefits&#13;
from food grains research, would at least equal 15 percent. In this case the switching&#13;
values indicate that the benefits from all NARP II research could decrease by 18 percent&#13;
(assuming the highly unlikely event that (gross) benefits from other research would be nil)&#13;
or alternatively overall costs could increase by 22 percent, and the ERR would still be&#13;
equal to the OCC or 12 percent. Based on the above analysis, the economic benefits from&#13;
the project could be expected to be similar to the usual benefits resulting from projects of&#13;
this nature.&#13;
6.12  Clearly, management of the research program would have an impact on the&#13;
benefits from the project. An effectively run KARI, along with efficient resource flows to&#13;
support research in the high priority areas, a favorable policy environment and market&#13;
developments would naturally lead to high rates of return. A major focus of the project is&#13;
to enhance KARI's management capacity and transform it into a more effective institution.&#13;
This emphasis will increase the likelihood of the project providing these benefits.&#13;
B. EMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY IMPACT&#13;
6.13  The project will have an indirect long-term impact on income generation in rural&#13;
Kenya by assisting in putting in place a coherent agricultural development strategy. The&#13;
crop and livestock commodities that will be addressed by the project are those that are&#13;
grown by resource-poor, smaliholder farmers who constitute about 80 percent of Kenya's&#13;
population. Through the eventual adoption of improved agricultural production and farm&#13;
management techniques, the project will lead to increases in smallholder productivity and&#13;
farm output, thus generating additional income for farmers and their household members.&#13;
The project's focus on generating new and improved technologies for the sustainable&#13;
production of food and export crops by resource-poor smallholder farmers would&#13;
ultimately secure the food supply and increase incomes, and will therefore be an important&#13;
component of Kenya's poverty alleviation strategy. Most of the poor are in the relatively&#13;
high-potential areas where intensification of agriculture through research based&#13;
productivity growth is likely to take place, and thus where most of the poverty alleviation&#13;
will occur.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL LIPACT&#13;
6.14  This project has been given an environment assessment category C since its main&#13;
objective is environmental conservation while increasing crop and animal production to&#13;
meet the food needs of a growing human population. Priority is being given to soil and&#13;
water conservation research to protect the basic resources of agriculture. By increasing&#13;
productivity on existing farms, the project will lessen the need for farmers to&#13;
unnecessarily expand agriculture into marginal lands, which is usually accompanied by&#13;
serious degradation; it will also lead to less destruction of forests and water catchments. A&#13;
sustainable strategy to achieve improved soil fertility management would be developed.&#13;
Research on fertilizer use will concentrate on finding the most appropriate fertilizers for&#13;
the different soils and the correct application rates which will enhance environmental&#13;
conservation. A low-input strategy for pesticides would be developed, given the large&#13;
environmental and health concerns with increased emphasis on development of Integrated&#13;
Pest Management (IPM). In some situations, the use of chemicals may be eliminated&#13;
through new technology (e.g., immunization against East Coast Fever). The possible&#13;
danger of contamination of natural genetic materials through the introduction of exotic&#13;
materials will be minimized through assurance of the use of up-to-date technologies and&#13;
testing in controlled conditions before extrapolation. Overall therefore, NARP II's&#13;
environmental impact would be positive.&#13;
D. SOCIAL AND GENDER ISSUES&#13;
6.15  The project would promote awareness of the social and cultural dimensions of&#13;
development, including gender-related issues, through the involvement of the full range of&#13;
beneficiaries in the planning and implementation of research, to ensure that social, cultural,&#13;
and gender focus and concerns are reflected. Monitoring and evaluation of social and&#13;
gender-related issues will be carried out to ensure that relevant issues are considered and&#13;
that women, children, and other disadvantaged groups will benefit from technological&#13;
innovations introduced under the project.&#13;
E. RISKS&#13;
6.16  The macroeconomic and sectoral performance risks facing the project hinge on the&#13;
Government staying the course on the reform program. Progress is relatively steady and&#13;
outstanding macroeconomic issues as well as sector specific structural issues are being&#13;
addressed (paras. 2.6, 2. 7 and 6. 2).&#13;
6.17  The other main risks facing the project could be: (i) inadequate or unreliable&#13;
Government funding of non-salary operating costs; (ii) an ineffective Government&#13;
disbursement system; (iii) inadequate progress on KARI's transformation program into a&#13;
more effective institution, (iv) slow progress in focusing on the highest national research&#13;
priorities; (v) inadequate effort to incorporate farmer clients as full participants in the&#13;
research process; and (vi) the slow transfer of industrial crop research to the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
6.18 The Government funding risk would be addressed through firm Government&#13;
commitments on the allocation and release of funds in accordance with annual work plans&#13;
and related financing plans (para. 4.28), which would be monitored closely during&#13;
implementation. KARI is also in the process of finalizing a strategy of establishing&#13;
sustainable funding mechanisms to supplement the Government's budget allocation for&#13;
agricultural research. The Government disbursement system (particularly Special Account&#13;
management) is being addressed at the country level, and the Government has agreed to a&#13;
plan to accelerate disbursements. Some of the donors, the EU in particular, have&#13;
committed to finance the retrenchment program. KARI's plan for the rationalization of its&#13;
research center network is expected to face strong resistance, particularly from the local&#13;
officials who would not want research centers in their provinces to be closed down. In&#13;
this regard, KARI will continue to explore the possibility of transferring some of its&#13;
research centers to private sector producer/industry associations, as in the case of sugar&#13;
and pyrethrum.&#13;
6.19 Implementation of KARI's transformation program is already underway. The&#13;
Government's and KARI's commitment are reflected in the Letter of Sectoral Policy for&#13;
Agricultural Research (Annex 1) and in the agreed action plans. IDA's commitment to&#13;
supporting Kenya's agricultural research capability is a long-term one. It has to be&#13;
recognized that the objective of establishing a sustainable and effective research capability&#13;
would not be fully achieved by the end of the proposed project. Continued IDA support&#13;
would be required. Concerted efforts to make farmer clients full partners in research&#13;
through representation on research committees at local, regional, and national levels, and&#13;
especially through the farming systems approach introduced under NARP I. FSA would&#13;
be greatly expanded under NARP II.&#13;
6.20  Transfer of responsibility for research on industrial crops would be implemented&#13;
through agreed action plans, undertaken in the context of subsector development&#13;
programs prepared under the Second Agricultural Sector Management Project. Progress&#13;
on implementing the plans also would be accorded close attention during supervision.&#13;
F. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
6.21  Currently, the total annual expenditure on agricultural research is around 2 percent&#13;
of agricultural GDP. This amount of expenditures is on the high side for sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa and underscores the emphasis placed on research in Kenya. In comparison,&#13;
research expenditures in the United States and Western Europe is well over 2 percent of&#13;
agricultural GDP. During the project period, the Governments is expected to contribute&#13;
US$8.7 million (or about US$1.7 million annually) for incremental operating costs. This&#13;
is within current budgetary allocations.&#13;
6.22  GOK finance about a third of the total cost of agricultural research and the balance&#13;
is currently financed by donors. The donor share of research financing is expected to&#13;
gradually decline over the years. At the end of NARP IL, GOK share of financing is&#13;
expected to increase slightly to 42 percent. However, continued donor involvement in the&#13;
financing of research is envisaged after NARP II. Initiatives being taken under the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
will attempt to reduce the fiscal burden of research expenditures by transferring the&#13;
financing burden to industry organizations in the case of industrial crops, retrenchment of&#13;
non-essential support staff, rationalization of KARI's research center network, and&#13;
expanding KARI's revenue base through the sale of seeds and planting materials of&#13;
improved crop varieties, animal breeds, and vaccines.&#13;

Dear f(i k&#13;
LETTER OF SECTORAL POLICY   NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL&#13;
RESEARCH PROJECT PHASE II (NARP II)&#13;
The agricultural sector continues to be the backbone of&#13;
Kenya's  economy.   The Government  attaches  high priority to the&#13;
sector's role in promoting growth, reducing poverty and conserving&#13;
the  environment.    This  letter  highlights  the  sector's  main&#13;
constraints and the Government' s strategies to address them with&#13;
soecific attention to actions that will facilitate the development&#13;
oa,  new  technologies  for  agricultural   production  and  their&#13;
dissemination to farmers.   The strategies  outlined here will  be&#13;
used by the Government to underpin the design and implementation of&#13;
the proposed joint-donor assisted Second National Agricultural&#13;
Research Project (NARP II), and the Agricultural Sector Investment&#13;
Project (ASIP) as well as all other donor-supported projects.&#13;
Background&#13;
Kenyan Agricultuire's Recent Performance and Future ProsDects&#13;
In  recent  years  Kenyan  agriculture  has  not  achieved  its&#13;
optimum potential.  The growth rate averaged 4.7 percent per annum&#13;
between 1960 and 1970 but declined to 2.7 percent per annum between&#13;
1970 and 1982.  It picked up again to 3.8 per cent per annum in&#13;
1982 to 1988, but was barely positive in 1991 and turned negative&#13;
in 1992 and 19993.  In the last two years, however the growth rate&#13;
has increased  to over 3.5  per  cent  per annum.   Private gross&#13;
capital formation in agriculture fell by 0.4% in the 1980, and even&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

furzher by 3. 1% o.a. in the early  1990 to 1993.  It  3, nGoweVer&#13;
eaxec7ed to ircrease as the economi_ growth did in 1934. arc 1395&#13;
Tnese fluctuations are explained by subcivision of cultivarec areas&#13;
a'c climatic var-ao!ilty, but  sustainea agricultural grzw:n was&#13;
suoseQuently  maintained  primarily  througn  the  introcuction  of&#13;
te-hnological  change  emoodied  in  release  and  adootion of  new&#13;
varieties, relazed technologically packaged and improved farming&#13;
oractices.   ine siow growth  in agr,cultural  GOP anc continuing&#13;
Casirvestment ,n the sector has hac signifi,cant repercussisns on&#13;
agriculture's  zontr,bution  to  overall   economic  gr.wth.    As&#13;
agr,culture's con:ribution to GOP growth declined, so aic overall&#13;
economic growt' wnich in tne 90's has been well below -ne rate of&#13;
poculation increase.  Consecuently, average incomes have fal len and&#13;
the incidence of ooverty has almost certainly increasea.  Without&#13;
greater investment in agriculture, it is unlikely that the economy&#13;
will grow as fast as desired in order to reduce poverty.&#13;
The Government expects the economy to grow at a rate of about&#13;
7 oercent annually between  1996 and 2000 to provide sufficient&#13;
emPloyment for tne growing labour force.  This rate of growth has&#13;
to be underpinned by at least a 4.4 percent per annum growth in&#13;
agricultural procuction and a 1.5 -percent annual growtn in labour&#13;
productivity.   Threse  targets  have  not  ceen  acnieved and  the&#13;
clallenge is even greater now. The choices are very clear.  Unless&#13;
agriculture gets rack on a sustainec growth path of between 4-5&#13;
p-rcent oer year, it will be very cifficult for Kenya to grow at a&#13;
rate f"ast enough to arrest tne decline in per capita income, create&#13;
suftic,ent   emplcyment  opportunities  ana  make  a  signirhcant&#13;
contribution towards oover:y reduction.  Furthermore, unless farm-&#13;
leval procuctivi-y and incomes are raisea, tnere wil1 corninue to&#13;
oc  out-rnigratiorn  to the frag-ile  aril  and  semi-arid areas thus&#13;
contributing to environmental degradation of these marg nal lands.&#13;
Another asoect is that relatively low farm incomes encourage rural&#13;
u-oan migration of people in search of employment, a trend which&#13;
may fuel social upneavals.&#13;
The  Government  is convinced  that  the  agricultural  growth&#13;
challenge can oe met as observec by the grcwth- of the sector in&#13;
1994 and 1995.  Althougn the sectcr has consicerable potential for&#13;
growth, wide tecnnolo9y gaps exist  and there  is scoce to raise&#13;
cuzout by increasing the use of imcroved inputs and there are,&#13;
also, ample opcoftunities for prcauctive investment.&#13;
Significant potential also remains for tne diversification of&#13;
the sector from  low to higher value commodities.   The future,&#13;
tnerefore,   1ies  in  transforming   smallholder  farms  from  a&#13;
suzsistence  orientation  to  a  farm  enterprise  orientation  by&#13;
accelera ing the change in the mix of farming activities to those&#13;
W-ich aad more value per unit of land and labour.&#13;
Trere  1s limited scope  for scatial  agricultural  expansion&#13;

ror  agr cuitu aI  growth   are  tnrougn    intensification    and&#13;
civersirica.ion   into hicher  value  commcd.ties.   Amongst  the&#13;
industrial/ex:orr crops,  tea. hort culture and coffee offer tne&#13;
greates7 wotential.  In the food crops sector, maize and potatoes&#13;

couic easily be the front runner.   These are the main areas rhat&#13;
can zicome imoortan: sources of grcwth in the medium term.&#13;
Minor cereals, while being importan. crops from a food self-&#13;
su-f,ciency coint of view,  are unlikely  to make a significanz&#13;
conrributior to growth and the livestock sector, beef procuct.on&#13;
will  contirue to keep pace with population  increase and rising&#13;
incomes.  Poultry can also become arn.mportant supplementary source&#13;
of cash  income  for smailholder  farmers.    In all  these areas,&#13;
technology  generation  and  dissemination  to  ena users  is more&#13;
critical now than even before.&#13;
National Agricultural Research Proiect&#13;
The croCosed NARP  II is the seconc in supoort of Kenya's&#13;
National Agricul;ural Research Programme,  in follow-up to NARP I&#13;
(Credit  1 aL9-KE),  curing  wnich  the  Inrernational  Develooment&#13;
Association (IDA), The European Union (EU), the Government of t'Le&#13;
Netnerlancs  (GoN),  the  Unitea States  Agency  for  International&#13;
Develooment (USAID), the Overseas Development Administration (OOA)&#13;
of t.e United Kingdom, ano several orher donors provided assistance&#13;
to the Government for programme implementation.  NARP I's primary&#13;
objectives were to: (i) focus on prioriLy research programmes with&#13;
a slgrnifcant  ikelihood of high ana early returns to investments;&#13;
('i)   cevelop   technologies   that   contribute   to   increasad&#13;
productivity,  particularly  of  smallho'dings;   (iii)  intensify&#13;
orocucer  participation  in research  programme  formulation; (iv)&#13;
encourage cooperation between KARI and other institutions involved&#13;
in agricultural  research;  and  (v)  strengthen  linkages  between&#13;
research and extension.  The strategy to achieve these goals was to&#13;
reorganize agricultural research into a single Kenya Agricultural&#13;
Research  Institute (KARI)  and to  support  the Institute in the&#13;
implementation of the -fARP.&#13;
The first phase objectives have been largely achieved.  NARP&#13;
T laid the institutional foundation for agricultural research in&#13;
Kenya.  KARI has been established as a semi-autonomous institution&#13;
with  its own Board and nas  responsibility  for publicly-funded&#13;
agricultural research wnile coffee and tea research is organized&#13;
through foundations financed by growers.   Donor coordination has&#13;
been greatly improved.  KARI's accounting systems were reorganized&#13;
and  computeri_ed.    An  improved  Scheme  of  Service  has  been&#13;
ir:roducec ifor scientific staff ana staff training programme has&#13;
been very effective.&#13;
&#13;

A  networx  o f  Research  Centres  has  been  set  uD  wi th&#13;
resoons1bility for both strategic anc acapt ve researcn; and for&#13;
research extension linkages.  An Agricultural Research Func (ARF),&#13;
,financec   througn   Government,  donor   and   private  incustry&#13;
contrioutions,  was  established  to  encourage   contract   and&#13;
colIaoorative research.  For imoortant crops such as maize, sorghum&#13;
and po,tao, KART now has considerable  on the shelf  technology in&#13;
terms or  imoroved  varieties  and  better  cultivation  prac ices;&#13;
imoortant achievements have also been mace in the areas of animal&#13;
procuc:ion and health and soil and water management.&#13;
Looking aneac, tnere is a continuec and urgent need to remove&#13;
policy barriers to the adoo.ion of new tecnnologies.  In aadition,&#13;
notwithstanding the areas of progress under NARP r, suoport to the&#13;
national agricultural research system requires to be continued and&#13;
increased  to  maintain  the  momentum,  address  newly  emerging&#13;
priorities,  and solidify agricultural  research funding including&#13;
financing by bringing in the private sector.&#13;
Several  on the shelf  technologies nave not been adequately&#13;
tested  and  evaluated  by  farmers  for  their  relevance  and&#13;
acooTabili:y.   In other cases the delivery system (e.g for seeds&#13;
and orner planting materials) are inadequate and require further&#13;
wo r k .&#13;
The  most  serious  challenge  under  NARP  I has  been  the&#13;
d,i-fficulty for tne Government to orovide funds to KARI in a timely&#13;
fashion and in the required amounts, according to the established&#13;
pr,orities anc work plans.  Problems were also encountered due to&#13;
.nsufficient  adootion  of  imoroved  technologies  developed  by&#13;
research.  All these will be addressed in NARP T I. In addition the&#13;
terms and conditions of service for research staff require further&#13;
imorovemnent with special recognition of research impact.&#13;
NARP II is therefore being designed to especially suoport an&#13;
intens7fied effort towards technology development and adaptation to&#13;
soecific  agro-ecological  and  socio-economic  environments  and&#13;
improvement of the technology delivery systems.  An important focus&#13;
of  NARP  II will  be on fostering  the timely  availability  and&#13;
efficient use of all av'ailable financial resources for agricultural&#13;
research.&#13;
Strategies and Plans&#13;
The Government of Kenya has been implementing an economic&#13;
reform programme whose main objective is to reduce poverty through&#13;
restoration  of  sustainable  growth.        As  in  the  past,  the&#13;
agricultural sector is expected to provide the main imPetus for&#13;
e-onomic  and  social  growth  and  develoPmen..    The key policy&#13;
soJeczives include the need to achieve and maintain internal food&#13;

wnnich  hitherto  dealt  with  the  marketing  and  processing  of&#13;
agricultural commodities. The latter includes the priva.ization of&#13;
various agricultural-based parastatals.&#13;
Consistent with these changes, the institutional s-ructure of&#13;
the Ministry of Agricultural, Livestock Development an: Marketing&#13;
(,MALOM) is being reformulated; the role, function ano structure of&#13;
MALOM is in the orocess of being substantially re-designec; and the&#13;
role  of   cooperatives  in  the  production   and  mar&lt;ezing  of&#13;
agricultural  commodities  is being  re-examsned.   The Government&#13;
* ntends that by end of 1997 MALOM's activ ties will fzcus on the&#13;
core agricultural  services of suu3ort to adaptive research,  the&#13;
orovision of effective extension, essential quality control and&#13;
otner  regulatory  resoonsibilities.    Over  the medium term,  the&#13;
Government intends to comolete the policy reform ano institutional&#13;
restructuring agenda with the view  to accelerating agricultural&#13;
growth and productivity, thereby increasing rural incomes and rural&#13;
off-f,arm employment.&#13;
The  Government  continues  to  place  great  emonasis  on  the&#13;
Imoortance of agricultural technclogy generation, ceve'ooment and&#13;
Gissemination.  The Government, therefore,  recognizes .ne role of&#13;
KARI as crucial to accelerated  cevelopment.   Consecuently,  the&#13;
Government is committed to ensuring that KARI will operate in an&#13;
environment  conducive to  effective  and  efficient execution  of&#13;
agricultural  research  programmes,  including  the  provision  of&#13;
adequate operation and-maintenance recurrent funds in a timely and&#13;
cepencable  manner.   The Government  is  also  committed  to  the&#13;
maintenance of attractive terms anc conditions of service for staff&#13;
through regular reviews in order to retain a highly qualified and&#13;
croductive human resource in the agricultural researc., service.&#13;
To  achieve  impact  of  research  on  imoroved germclasm,  the&#13;
Government considers it essential that an effective ano efficient&#13;
national system for the multiplication and distriburtin of seeds&#13;
and elan7ing materials is in place.  The Government also recognizes&#13;
-na- the seed ,ndustry in Kenya woulc benefit from increased but&#13;

iii) establisn   financially   self-suooorting   breecer  and&#13;
foundation seed units in KARI centres, basec on the sale&#13;
of KARl's foundation and breeder seeds to Private sector&#13;
seed comoanies, farmer seec procucers besiCes the Kenya&#13;
Seed Comoany;&#13;
iv)  improve public plant cuaranzine facilities ;o facilitate&#13;
tne imocr. and export of seeds.  The resocnsibility for&#13;
seed insoection and certification will be assumec by the&#13;
proocsec Kenya Plant Health InsPecr-orare Service (KEPHIS)&#13;
as soon as the Service is establ shed;&#13;
v)   strengthan the researcn-sxtens.on-farmer cOllaborative&#13;
linkages, particularly the information feecoack mechanism&#13;
,rom far.mers to the research cent res and final research&#13;
programming, and&#13;
vi)  institute cost-sharing and recovery mecnanisms whereby&#13;
-he consumer of research  oroducts contri:uze funds to&#13;
meet KARr's requirements for ooerating and maintenance&#13;
expenses, for example, through collection of royalties,&#13;
levies/cess etc., basea on sale of commercial seed and&#13;
other planting materials.&#13;
With the current resource constraints,  the Government will&#13;
contin~ue to encourage KARI to give emphasis to the execution of&#13;
livestock,  crop and  factor  research  projects  that  are of  the-&#13;
highest national or,ority.  In the context of the procosed NARP II,&#13;
the Government has initiated a review of KARI and has caveloped an&#13;
action plan to streamline the Institute to allow it to implement&#13;
its mandate more effectively and efficiently.   Implementation of&#13;
this plan is scheduled to occur over the 1995-97 period.  This will&#13;
include a rationalization of the Research Centre NetworK, reduction&#13;
in  non-essential  staff,  re-deployment  of  staff,  and  greatly&#13;
imoroved funding of, non-salary research ocerating costs.  Before&#13;
July  5996, the Government will  strengthen and expand .he role of&#13;
KARI's  Agricultural  Research  Fund  (ARF)  in  the  financing  of&#13;
research  contracts". including ccllaborative researon with other&#13;

KARI receives f-inancial resources for implementatior of its&#13;
programmes from Government, external donors (including grants-in-&#13;
aid from USAID, ODA, the Netherlands, UNOP,  JICA, SIDA, EU), and&#13;
the private  sector.   As a consequence  of  declining  budgetary&#13;
resources, the Institute needs to identify sources of funds and&#13;
mecnanisms from outside the Government and its present donors to&#13;
comolement  resources from *hese two sources ana, eventually,  to&#13;
srovice a more sustainable source of resar-ch funding.  KARI is&#13;
therefore  in the orocess  of shifting  resoonsibility  for  some&#13;
research work to the private sector througn a variety of mechanisms&#13;
sucn as cost-snaring,  contracting  and comocete transfer of the&#13;
resconsibility for research to approoriate commodity agencies.  The&#13;
Goverrment  strongly  supports  tris  search  for  new sources  or&#13;
agricultural research financing.  Similarly, the&#13;
Government is examining the status of various commodities with a&#13;
v,ew of instituting cost-sharing mechanisms to finance agricultural&#13;
researc.&#13;
The Action Programme&#13;
While much has been achieved througn Government and donor&#13;
assistance  to  Phase  I of  the  National  Agricultural  Research&#13;
Programme, the Government recognizes the need to provide further&#13;
support to KARI during Phase II of NARP.   This is necessary in&#13;
order to build on the achievements of NARP I and to effectively&#13;
respond to the continuing and emerging technology needs of an&#13;
increasingly  more complex  national  agricultural  sector.    The&#13;
Government wants to see the establishment of a strong and efficient&#13;
KARI poised to melt the production and develooment challenges of an&#13;
ecologically sustainable, stable gender-sensitive and profitable&#13;
agriculture in Kenya.&#13;
To bring this about, the Government will take the following&#13;
soeclfic actions:&#13;
i)   streamline the flow of resources so that adequate funds&#13;
reach KARI in a timely  manner.   In this regard the&#13;
Government will continue to monitor the flow of both GoK&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
In  recent years,  the Government  has  undertaken important&#13;
policy reforms which should promote growth and reduce cover.y.  It&#13;
is however, recognizea that substantial further progress is neeced&#13;
to meet the challenges of the 1990's.   This will reauire greatly&#13;
strengthened caoacity of the national agricultural research system.&#13;
The Government  believes  that  the  implementation  of the above&#13;
measures,  concurrent  with  ongoing  improvements  in the  policy&#13;
environment will bring about accelerated agricultural technology&#13;
development  and acoption  and hence  promote widespread  growth,&#13;
poverty reduction and the conservation of natural resources and&#13;
bic-diversity. The Government also believes tnat imolemnenza:ion of&#13;

SECOND NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT (NARP II)&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (PIP)&#13;
Guidelines for Format and Content&#13;
This document presents an outline for the preparation of the PIP. It is understood that the PIP&#13;
is organized on the project components and that the respective component-level implementation plans&#13;
are derived from the NARP 1I Project Implementation Manual (PIMj). Copies of both the PIM and PIP&#13;
are in the project file. Organizationally, each Component is the assigned responsibility of the Director&#13;
or Assistant Director overseeing the relevant Division or Unit of KARI. They have responsibility for&#13;
the more detailed implementation required within their respective areas.&#13;
1.    Purpose, Premises and Users&#13;
The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) for NARP II is first and foremost a management&#13;
tool to for senior-level institutional managers of KARI and the World Bank who are responsible, at their&#13;
institutional levels, for the overall management and monitoring of this project. The PIP for the initial&#13;
two years of the project was discussed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
As an executive-level management instrument, the purpose of the PIM is to focus the attention&#13;
of senior managers on project and program performance and on strategic issues and concerns affecting&#13;
the intended aims, outcomes and impacts of the project. It is meant to assist the senior-level managers&#13;
to assess and give guidance to those who are responsible for planning, implementing, monitoring,&#13;
managing project-related activities throughout KARI.&#13;
T;he design of the PIM is based on the following premises.&#13;
*     The PIM sets goals and guides implementation planning and decision-making, but does&#13;
not specify or impose specific activities or operational decisions.&#13;
*     The PIM promotes performance; it does not prescribe operational plan details.&#13;
*     The PIM sets the framework for measuring and evaluating progress toward&#13;
programmatic and project goals and targets.&#13;
*     The PIM is adaptable in format and structure so that implementation infonnation can&#13;
be updated on semi-annual and annual basis as required by KARI and the World Bank.&#13;
The most important uses of the PIM will be for KARI's continuous, internal quarterly and semi-&#13;
annual reviews and for the World Bank's annual and mid-term joint GOK-Donor review meetings.&#13;
2.    Management Requirements of Users&#13;
The key users of the PIM are institutional-level decision-makers. In KARI, these are (i) The&#13;
KARI Board, (ii) The KARI Management, (iii) KARI Directors and Assistant Directors and (iv)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Research Center Directors. In the World Bank, these are (i) Task Manager, (ii) Technical Support&#13;
Officers, and (iii) Supervision Mission members. In the Ministry of Research, Technology and&#13;
Technical Training, these are (i) Senior Management Team of the Ministry, (ii) Budgeting and&#13;
Accounting Officers, and (iii) Technical Liaison Officers.&#13;
The GOK and KARI institutional-level project implementation management requirements focus&#13;
on planning, managing, coordinating, guiding and controlling organizational and project resources for&#13;
achieving the project purposes and expected outcomes. The World Bank executive-level project&#13;
implementation management requirements focus largely on monitoring and evaluation project progress:&#13;

3. PIM Structure&#13;
The PIM is structured in line with the following key terms. "Project" refers to NARP II in its&#13;
totality. "Dimension" refers to one of the three aspects of the project -- (1) Institutional Development,&#13;
&#13;

(2) Research Program Implementation, and (3) Special Programs. (Note that these were called&#13;
"components" in the World Bank documentation. "Component" is used to refer to the primary project&#13;
implementation areas which comprise the elements or sub-components of the project dimensions.&#13;
The PIM will be organized into the following sections.&#13;
Section 1: Summary of NARP II&#13;
The PIM comprises an introductory chapter with a summary of the project scope and objectives&#13;
and other project information deemed relevant for executive-level implementation management&#13;
and monitoring. Critical information contained in other project documents such as the Staff&#13;
Appraisal Report, Aide Memoires and Working Papers are included.&#13;
Section 2: Organizational Arrangements for Implementation&#13;
This section of the PIM presents the organizational structure for project implementation,&#13;
including organizational responsibilities for implementation, relationships with other relevant&#13;
organizations and parties, and administrative arrangements for project implementation.&#13;
Section 3: Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
This section of the PIM presents a summary of the monitoring and evaluation arrangements for&#13;
the project, in particular the World Bank supervision and evaluation plan, and identifies critical&#13;
project conditions, covenants and key impact indicators which require monitoring and/or special&#13;
attention.&#13;
Section 4: Financial Management Arrangements&#13;
This section of the PIM presents the project accounting and financial management system,&#13;
agreement on auditing procedures and schedules, and arrangements for project accounts,&#13;
statements of expenditure and financial reporting. It 1 includes the overall financial plan and&#13;
schedule for the project.&#13;
Section 5: Project Component Implementation Plans&#13;
This comprises the largest section of the PIM. The structure and content of the PIM is based&#13;
on the Project Components as defined in Section 4 which are consistent with the project&#13;
documents and are in line with the organizational structures and responsibilities of KARI, as&#13;
portrayed on KARI's organizational structure.&#13;
4.    Organization of PIM by Project Components&#13;
The preparation of the PIM and implementation plans for NARP II is organized around the&#13;
project components within each dimension.&#13;

5.    PIM Implementation Information Requirements for Components&#13;
The implementation plans for each of the project's Components consist of the information&#13;
indicated on the following list and worksheets.&#13;
1.    Brief Introductory Narrative for the Component&#13;
(one-two paragraphs -- summarized from Project and Appraisal Reports)&#13;
2.    Statement of Objective(s) for the Component&#13;
(one-two paragraphs -- summarized from Project and Appraisal Reports)&#13;
3.    Key Roles, Responsibilities related to Project Implementation and Organizational&#13;
Structures and Components&#13;
4.    List of Key Milestones and Benchmarks by year for life of project.&#13;
5.    Component Summary Implementation Framework: A summary chart to be used for&#13;
monitoring the key elements of each Component. (See Figure 1)&#13;
6.    The Component Summary Implementation Plan: A chart summarizing the planned&#13;
year-by-year achievements and most important implementation factors to be monitored&#13;
at the executive level by KARI and the World Bank. (See Figure 2)&#13;
7.    A Component Summary Annual Implementation Monitoring Plan: A planning chart&#13;
which summarizes the annual achievements and factors to be monitored at the executive&#13;
level by KARI and the World Bank. (See Figure 3)&#13;
8.    Component Summary Implementation Schedule: A bar chart summarizing the&#13;
implementation schedule by key activities and by quarter-years for life of the project.&#13;
(See Figure 4)&#13;
The format allows the plans in the PIM to be updated for use in semi-annual, annual and&#13;
special review and evaluation meetings and exercises agreed upon and coordinated by KARI and the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
At such meetings, the managers can also be requested to prepare a Management Submission&#13;
consisting of a narrative of additional management and implementation information which may be&#13;
useful for executive management project reviews. These can be updated for reviews and can cover, for&#13;
example, the status or any related issues such as: critical project inputs, project outputs and outcomes,&#13;
complementary projects, key assumptions, implementation issues, sustainability issues, etc.&#13;

KENYA&#13;
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT-PHASE II (NARP II)&#13;
The National Agricultural Research Strategy and Plan&#13;
1.    Kenya continues to require significant and sustained increases in agricultural production to keep&#13;
pace with population growth, provide additional employment, generate better standards of living and&#13;
increase exports. There is extreme pressure on the resource base of land and water. Greatly increased&#13;
productivity must therefore be achieved while maintaining or if possible, improving the productive&#13;
capacity of natural resources.&#13;
2     In addition to the inadequacies in the policy environment, the physical challenges to increasing&#13;
sustained agricultural growth are formidable. There is very little high potential agricultural land left for&#13;
expansion of cultivated agriculture or grazing, leaving intensification of land use as the only viable&#13;
option for increased production. Plots of land continue to be subdivided to a size that is increasingly&#13;
unable to sustain the families which farm them, leading to migration to semi-arid areas, encroachment&#13;
of farming into forests and game parks and widespread off-farm employment in search for additional&#13;
sources of income. The fragile drier areas are experiencing adverse environmental impacts of rapid&#13;
population increases and use of inappropriate technologies. The spread of settled agriculture in these&#13;
areas denying pastoralists access to dry season grazing areas, have also caused deepening poverty&#13;
among the mainly nomadic people.&#13;
3.    Transformation of agriculture and moving the sector to a higher growth path, encouraging&#13;
private enterprise and refocusing the role of Government, will require new yield and productivity&#13;
enhancing technology. In order for the research system to operate efficiently and have impact, it is&#13;
essential to have a clear vision of the national agricultural development strategy and the research&#13;
priorities. The framework which guides KARI in the identification of the Institute's research priorities&#13;
is laid down in major policy documents endorsed by GOK which outline the role and obligations of the&#13;
1                 2&#13;
National Agricultural Research System (NARS) and its main thrusts.&#13;
4.     Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 focuses on the adoption of more productive practices in&#13;
agriculture using improved varieties and fertilizers, and control of diseases and pests. It emphasizes&#13;
The NARS includes all institutions and organizations involved in agricultural research in Kenya, not just&#13;
KARI.&#13;
2&#13;
Important among these are: Sessional Papers No. 1 of 1986 on Economic Management for Renewed&#13;
Growth and No. 1 of 1994, on Recovery and Sustainable Development to the year 2000; the National&#13;
Development Plans of 1989-1993, and of 1994-1996; the National Council for Science and Technology&#13;
Report on National Priority Areas (No. 30 of October, 1989);and the National Agricultural Research&#13;
Strategy and Plan (1986), and several PFPs, especially the latest (1995-1997).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
research on new varieties especially in maize and other food grains, production of tea, coffee and&#13;
vegetables in order to generate higher incomes and employment. The paper lists the following crops in&#13;
order of priority: coffee, tea, maize, wheat, milk, meat and horticultural crops. Those listed as&#13;
secondary are: sorghum, millet, rice, root crops, sugar and oil crops. Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1994&#13;
stresses the importance of the development and diffusion of technical innovations to enhance yields and&#13;
the availability and efficient use of labor, fertilizers and other inputs; the promotion of high value&#13;
agricultural activities to generate increased employment, incomes and foreign exchange is advocated.&#13;
The paper advocates strengthening agricultural research and extension services and ensuring improved&#13;
effectiveness through increased financing for non-salary operating and maintenance costs, among others&#13;
as a result of Civil Service Reform. Strengthening of linkages between research (KARI) and extension&#13;
(MALDM) is emphasized. Research on horticulture and oil crops is assigned high priority. The&#13;
importance of protecting and ensuring the sustainable use of genetic resources is stressed.. It is stated&#13;
that agricultural marketing institutions and other organizations will be encouraged to collect commodity-&#13;
specific research levees such as already exist for coffee, tea and sugar. The Government's policy to&#13;
ensure an adequate supply of good quality seeds for a wide range of crops is high-lighted, urging the&#13;
private sector to invest in seed production and distribution. The importance of small-scale irrigation&#13;
development through private farmers initiative is emphasized.&#13;
5.     The National Development Plan (1989-1993), outlines an overall thrust for agricultural policy&#13;
in Kenya. According to the plan, the three principal development policy objectives for Kenya are:&#13;
(i)    to achieve internal self-sufficiency in agricultural production;&#13;
(ii)   to maintain adequate levels of strategic reserves; and&#13;
(iii)  to generate additional supplies for export.&#13;
6.     This policy thrust is expected to contribute towards the attainment of Kenya's objectives of&#13;
increased employment, income generation, foreign exchange earnings, rural and urban balance, food&#13;
security and overall economic growth. The document for 1994-1996 reiterates these broad policy&#13;
objectives. In addition, it stresses the importance of agricultural research, of age and gender as factors&#13;
in agricultural production, of safeguarding the country's genetic resources and of recognizing Plant&#13;
Breeders' Rights. A commitment is made to maintaining an up-to-date assessment of national&#13;
agricultural research capacity and to the optimum utilization of human resources and infrastructure;&#13;
closer collaboration between KARI, Universities and LARCs is advocated, confirming that KARI will&#13;
maintain its role as the umbrella organization for agricultural research in Kenya. The Plan also&#13;
recommends that the application of biotechnology in agriculture and livestock production be encouraged&#13;
and developed. It advocates competition in seed production and marketing, and the need for&#13;
Government to continue to ensure seed quality.&#13;
7.     The National Council for Science and Technology Report identifies as research priorities: post&#13;
harvest processing and storage, watershed management and hydrological studies (especially in relation&#13;
to the conservation and management of soil resources), plant and animal genetic resources, crop&#13;
production, agro-forestry systems, plant and animal health and diseases, animal production management&#13;
and ecology, agricultural policy research, the economics of farming, education and extension and,&#13;
energy for production in agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
8.     In the current draft PFP, the Government recognizes that the seed industry in Kenya would&#13;
benefit from increased competition. In order to have a competitive seed industry in operation, the&#13;
Government would take additional steps to:&#13;
(i)    issue a policy statement allowing for production and trade of all seeds especially&#13;
cereals) and planting materials by a plurality of MALDM-approved producers/traders;&#13;
(ii)   liberalize marketing of seed;&#13;
(iii)   establish financially self-sustaining breeder and foundation Seed Units at the Kenya&#13;
Agricultural Research Institute's (KARI) research centers based on the sale of KARI's&#13;
foundation and breeder seed to private sector seed companies and farmer seed&#13;
producers; and&#13;
(iv)   improve public plant quarantine facilities to facilitate the import and export of seed.&#13;
9.     The Government acknowledges the importance of technology generation and dissemination in&#13;
its strategy to accelerate agricultural growth; in that respect, the role of KARI is crucial. In the context&#13;
of NARP II, the Government has initiated a review of KARl and has developed an action plan to&#13;
streamline the Institute to allow it to implement its mandate more effectively and efficiently.&#13;
Implementation of this plan is scheduled to occur over 1995-97. This will include a rationalization of&#13;
the Research Center Network, reduction in number of non-essential support staff, redeployment of&#13;
scientists, and greatly improved funding of non-salary research operating costs. The Government will&#13;
examine the potential for financing agricultural research from levies based on agricultural seed sales.&#13;
'he Government will also strengthen KARI's performance and facilitate agricultural research being&#13;
focused on the key priorities by expanding the role of KARl's Agricultural Research Fund (ARF) in the&#13;
financing of research "contracts", including collaborative research with other National or International&#13;
Agricultural Research Institutions.&#13;
10.    The research priorities generated and accepted by KARI such as laid out in the "Agricultural&#13;
Research Priorities to the Year 2000" and the NARP Phase II PPD, are based on the above national&#13;
development goals and objectives. The national research thrusts identified and detailed in the research&#13;
priority statement based on the key national priority areas, including: proper management and&#13;
conservation of the natural resource base as an insurance for sustained agricultural productivity;&#13;
promotion of national food security; sustained use of under-exploited natural resources; generation of&#13;
employment opportunities in order to alleviate poverty and thus facilitate overall economic growth; and&#13;
generation of foreign exchange earnings through export of surplus agricultural products.&#13;

NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT-PHASE II (NARP 11)&#13;
The Regional Agricultural Research Strategy of Countries in the ASARECA&#13;
1.    KARI is a member of the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in&#13;
Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA), established at Addis Ababa in September 1994 and&#13;
comprising the National Agricultural Research Institutes of 9 countries in the region (Burundi,&#13;
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire). ASARECA is&#13;
the region's response to the critical need for efficiency and effectiveness in agricultural&#13;
research, and based on the realization that the NARSs of the Eastern and Central Africa (ECA)&#13;
region together can be more than the sum of its parts. The members of ASARECA have&#13;
endorsed a "Framework for Action", which seeks to better equip national agricultural research&#13;
to make its essential contribution to equitable development, food security and environmental&#13;
sustainability, both regionally and nationally.&#13;
2.     This will involve:&#13;
(i)    Institutional reforms of NARSs, building capacity to evolve an enabling environment&#13;
for creativity, innovation and improved performance. This includes the generation of a&#13;
National Research Master Plan and Strategy. Agricultural research should feature&#13;
prominently on the agenda of policy-makers to ensure adequate, stable and timely&#13;
funding especially of recurrent research operating expenditures;&#13;
(ii)    New modes of regional collaboration among NARSs, based on the principles of&#13;
comparative advantage and relative strengths to achieve economies of scale and critical&#13;
mass to address common priority constraints; and,&#13;
(iii)   Farmers' participation in setting the research agenda, and research and extension&#13;
delivering technology to them in easily understandable terms. The active involvement&#13;
of scientists, farmers and extensionists in the implementation of research will be&#13;
encouraged and supported.&#13;
3.     Strengthening of the NARSs implies up-to-date national strategic plans for agricultural research&#13;
that include stakeholders in the setting of the research agenda, are gender-responsive and concemed with&#13;
environmental sustainability, and ensure that the research agenda reflects key development&#13;
opportunities, applies a production to consumption approach, and promotes institutional pluralism. The&#13;
FFA subscribes to the development of regional collaboration by rationalizing current collaborative&#13;
networks and by setting priorities for regional collaboration in agricultural and natural resources&#13;
management research, including involvement of the IARCs.&#13;
1&#13;
Two additional countries, Rwanda and Somalia are expected to join ASARECA later.&#13;
2&#13;

Eastern and Central Africa, World Bank, 1995".&#13;

NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT-PHASE II (NARP II)&#13;
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH FUND&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The need for local universities, private sector and individual scientists to complement and&#13;
supplement KARI efforts in agricultural research and development was identified during reorganization&#13;
and rationalization of the national agricultural research system (1985-86). The reorganization and&#13;
rationalization process resulted in a plan called the National Agricultural Research Program of&#13;
September, 1986. One of the Program's recommendations was the creation of an Agricultural Research&#13;
Fund (ARF). The ARF was established in February 1990, and officially launched by the Minister for&#13;
Research, Science and Technology on July 19, 1991. The ARF is now fully operational with a&#13;
Secretariat based at the KARI Headquarters.&#13;
RATIONALE&#13;
2.    The creation of the Agricultural Research Fund and its establishment within KARI is justified&#13;
as follows:&#13;
i)    Under the reorganized and rationalized National Agricultural Research System,&#13;
KARI is the major research organization responsible for research work on crops&#13;
and livestock, except research on some industrial crops, primarily coffee and tea.&#13;
It is charged with developing national agricultural research plans and priorities in&#13;
accordance with the national development goals and objectives.&#13;
ii)    KARI is a parastatal research organization established under the Science and&#13;
Technology (Amendment) Act of 1979. It is a body corporate with perpetual&#13;
succession and a common seal. It has power to acquire, hold and dispose of&#13;
movable and immovable property for its own purposes. Under this provision&#13;
KARI can receive grants, gifts and loans for the purposes of agricultural research.&#13;
Therefore, the creation of the ARF did not require the establishment of a separate&#13;
corporation.&#13;
iii)    As a statutory requirement under the Act, KARM is expected to establish and&#13;
strengthen linkages with other public and private organizations involved (directly or&#13;
indirectly) in agricultural research and production. Through appropriate forums&#13;
and linkage mechanisms, these organizations can contribute to the setting of&#13;
national research priorities, implementation of research programs and&#13;
dissemination and use of research results. The ARF constitutes a major linkage&#13;
mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
iv)    KARI's financial and procurement regulations and procedures are acceptable to&#13;
both the Kenya Government and to the broad donor community, thus facilitating&#13;
disbursement of funds and accountability.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.    The Agricultural Research Fund (ARF) was established to provide a mechanism for funding&#13;
agricultural research that is complementary to the research funding through KARI, universities and&#13;
other agencies from public, private bilateral and multilateral sources. Such complementarity is achieved&#13;
by focusing the ARF funds on selected, high priority topics within the framework of KARl's priorities&#13;
for supporting agricultural development, and by competitively allocating funds in a manner designed to&#13;
achieve synergy and cost-effective research.&#13;
4.    The specific objectives of the Agricultural Research Fund are:&#13;
i)    To more effectively access the country's scientific community and draw upon the&#13;
comparative advantage of various institutions to contribute to the priority research&#13;
of KARI.&#13;
ii)    To contribute to developing an environment that promotes and expands&#13;
opportunities for innovative research by scientists in both the public and private&#13;
sectors.&#13;
iii)   To achieve synergy and more cost-effective research through mechanisms that&#13;
enhance teamwork, collaboration between KARI scientists and those in public and&#13;
private institutions, and greater participation of stakeholders in the formulation and&#13;
funding of agricultural research proposals.&#13;
iv)    To broaden the participation of the private sector in supporting research,&#13;
particularly of major commodities, and&#13;
v)    To promote stronger linkages between agricultural research and tertiary level&#13;
training in agriculture to enhance the quality of training, particularly at post-&#13;
graduate levels.&#13;
ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE&#13;
5.    The Agricultural Research Fund is a discrete entity within KARI. It is managed, on behalf of&#13;
the KARI Board of Management, by the Research Fund Management Committee (RFMC). The&#13;
members of the RFMC comprise representatives drawn from public and private institutions, each&#13;
member having been chosen for his/her distinguished career in agricultural development, particularly&#13;
agricultural education, research or research management. Members serve for three years, extendible for&#13;
another three year term. The RFMC has the following broad representation and minimum of seven&#13;
appointed members:&#13;
*     Universities and Scientific community (three members)&#13;

traction; animal biotechnology; and animal production systems.&#13;
c)     Food Science: Post-harvest systems and technology; storage; food processing and&#13;
technology; food safety and quality; and food composition and nutritional value.&#13;
d)     Agroforestry: Agroforestry for control of soil erosion, improvement and&#13;
maintenance of soil fertility; multipurpose trees/shrubs for fodder, fruits, fuelwood,&#13;
timber, etc.; and farming systems.&#13;
e)     Natural products: Identification, isolation, characterization and preparation of&#13;
organic compounds to produce medicinal, insecticidal, biological and industrial&#13;
products.&#13;
f)     Aquaculture: Selection of sites; selecting, breeding, rearing and nutrition of&#13;
cultivable organisms; and disease control.&#13;
g)    Agricultural Policy and Economics: Research on policies affecting agricultural&#13;
research and development; pricing and marketing of commodities; and technology&#13;
adoption studies.&#13;
8.    It is anticipated that research proposals will be for highly applied research and contribute&#13;
directly to technology formulation and uptake by farmers, or lead to commercial applications.&#13;

ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURES&#13;
Invitation for Research Proposals&#13;
9.    The ARF Secretariat will publish the Invitation for Research Proposals in daily newspapers&#13;
(with copies sent to relevant institutions) in June each year. Application submissions are due by&#13;
September 15, and the applicants will be informed of the decisions by December 31 of the same year.&#13;
Grant funds will be available from January 1, of the following year.&#13;
10.   Applications must be made on Annex 1, the ARF Application Form, and be in accordance&#13;
with the guidelines provided in Annex 2 of the form. Copies, including telefaxed copies will not be&#13;
accepted. A copy of the application form may be used. The applicant must submit to the ARF&#13;
Secretariat the original signed document. The quality of the document must be good enough to&#13;
enable the Secretariat to make copies. Applications shall be prepared in English and typed.&#13;
Registration of Applications&#13;
11.   Each application received by the Secretariat will be given a number and entered in a register.&#13;
All research proposals will be filed and treated as confidential documents by the ARF Secretariat.&#13;
FUNDING SOURCES AND POLICIES&#13;
12.   Funding of the ARF comes from public and private institutions, donors and individuals. Initial&#13;
funding has come from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for US$0.521&#13;
million; KShs.20,000 from the Agricultural Research Foundation (AGREF) to support Small Ruminant&#13;
Research, and KShs. 1 million from the Kenya Seed company for crop varietal development and seed&#13;
technology; £50,000 pound sterling from the ODA; and US$49,000 from the World Bank. Government&#13;
contribution to the ARF would be provided through an IDA credit in the amount of about US$4 million.&#13;
Additional funding is to be sought from donors and Kenyan agro-industries, particularly those involved&#13;
with major commodities. Funds are maintained in a multi-donor account with a Commercial Bank.&#13;
Earmarking of funds for specific purposes by the donors is permitted, as are special conditions relating&#13;
to proprietary rights and royalties. In cases of such special conditions, these are reflected as an&#13;
addendum to the contract agreement between the ARF, the principal Investigator receiving the award&#13;
and the participating (host) institution.&#13;
13.   To attract industry funding of the ARF, the RFMC is prepared to consider allocating&#13;
matching funds in support of research grants supported through industry funding. Matching funds&#13;
may come either from untied ARF funds or from KARI where the proposed research is seen by&#13;
KARI management to be highly complementary to KARI work. The revised ARF provides an&#13;
attractive means by which the private sector/industry can contract research, by offering a&#13;
transparent and competitive system of research grant award, accounting, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. The incentives for such are i) the provision for the ARF to give matching grants for&#13;
funds provided by the private sector, and ii) the absence of any proprietary rights over the&#13;
technologies/varieties developed using funds from the ARF. ( The arrangements for collaborative&#13;
and contract research through the competitive mechanism of the ARF should be viewed as&#13;
complementary to those arrangements which KARI may wish to contract directly, in order to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

supplement its own research). It is the long-term objective of the RFMC to establish an Endowment&#13;
Fund for the ARF to sustain its operations. Accordingly the RFMC maintains a separate interest&#13;
bearing account with a Commercial Bank to receive grants and donations towards the establishment&#13;
of an Endowment Fund.&#13;

NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT-PHASE II (NARP Il)&#13;
KENYA AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Mandate and Mission&#13;
1.    The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) was established as a parastatal&#13;
organization by the 1979 Science and Technology (Amendment Act) to establish: a firm base for&#13;
developing a national agricultural research program responsive to the national development&#13;
objectives to develop well focused, relevant short and medium term research projects. This would&#13;
be accomplished through the establishment of a dynamic organizational structure and research&#13;
management systems, human resource development to produce highly skilled staff, and adoption of&#13;
a terms and conditions of service and performance incentive schemes to retain these staff and&#13;
provide them an environment conducive to high quality research and generation of relevant and&#13;
cost effective technologies, particularly for smallholder agriculture in Kenya. KARI is the main&#13;
institution comprising the Kenya National Agricultural Research System (NARS).&#13;
2.    KARl's programs focus on poverty alleviation and sustainability of agricultural&#13;
production while protecting the environment and conserving Kenya's natural resource base.&#13;
KARI's mission is to protect, conserve and improve the basic resources upon which Kenya&#13;
depends for agricultural development; increase and improve the quantity and quality of food and&#13;
other farm products, and thereby, increase the demand for those products in the local and export&#13;
markets. KARI will give emphasis to developing improved farming technologies which will&#13;
increase farmers' production and incomes and improve their quality of life. It is KARl's&#13;
responsibility to participate in the development of Kenya's Science and Technology policy&#13;
specially as it pertains to agricultural research policy, deternine agricultural research priorities,&#13;
formulate research plans to support national development objectives, and ensure that effective&#13;
mechanisms for integrating and linking technology generation and dissemination are in place.&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
3.    KARI started as a research institute located at Muguga under the East African Agriculture&#13;
and Forestry Organization (EAAFRO) and the East African Veterinary Research Organization&#13;
(EAVRO). Both organizations were attached to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock&#13;
Development and Marketing (MALDM). In 1986, KARI was established as a national&#13;
agricultural research organization by consolidating the former EAAFRO, EAVRO and the&#13;
scientific research division of the MALDM into the present KARI. When MALDM was split into&#13;
two ministries, KARI remained with the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1991, KARI was eventually&#13;
transferred to the Ministry of Research, Technical Training and Technology (MRTTT) where it&#13;
currently belongs.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 12                                -8  -&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
4.     The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute is managed by a Board of Management&#13;
comprising eleven ex-officio members representing relevant Government offices, and seven&#13;
appointed members representing researchers, members of the academe, agri-business&#13;
organizations/parastatals and farmers. KARI comprises a Headquarters Secretariat providing the&#13;
overall implementation coordination oversight for technical and administrative operations. The day&#13;
to day management of the Institute is the responsibility of the Director of KARI. He is assisted&#13;
two deputy directors, and 11 assistant directors who are experienced scientists in various areas of&#13;
agricultural research, personnel administration and financial management and accounting. KARI's&#13;
network of research centers and organizational chart are given in Attachment 1 and, Charts 1 and 2&#13;
respectively. KARI is comprised of National Research Centers (NRCs) and Regional Research&#13;
Centers (RRCs). The management of the research centers rests with Center Directors. Currently,&#13;
KARI has 11 centers with national mandates, 4 centers with both national and regional mandates&#13;
and 6 centers with regional mandates, spread throughout the country. In addition KARI has 12&#13;
subcenters which serve as experimental sites. National research programs are coordinated and&#13;
managed at NRCs by program leaders or program coordinators based at the NRCs. The RRC&#13;
directors, assisted by adaptive research coordinators, are responsible for the adaptive research&#13;
programs of the regions which are predominantly conducted in farmers' fields.&#13;
Research Programs&#13;
5.    The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute has put in place a process for research program&#13;
planning and priority setting which involves the active participation of the extension service, farmers&#13;
and other intended beneficiaries. Since 1991, KARI has established the research priorities for various&#13;
commodities, technical disciplines and factors of production. These priorities were reviewed in 1995&#13;
and further prioritization within the research programs has been initiated. KARI is currently&#13;
implementing strategic and problem-oriented, applied research programs, in various commodities&#13;
(cereals, fruits and vegetables, industrial crops, roots and tubers, floriculture, grain legumes, beef and&#13;
dairy cattle, small ruminants, poultry, etc.), factors of production (animal diseases, soil and water&#13;
management and conservation, range management, fertilizer use), and disciplines (integrated pest&#13;
management, postharvest physiology, socioeconomics, etc.). KARI has made significant achievements&#13;
in the development and release of improved, high yielding, disease resistant varieties of most of&#13;
strategic food and pasture crops, animal vaccines, animal disease diagnostic kits, fertilizer&#13;
recommendations packages, soil conservation and water harvesting technologies, integrated pest&#13;
management practices, dairy and beef production packages, and in the selection and development of&#13;
improved breeds of large and small ruminants.&#13;
Physical Infrastructure and Human Resource&#13;
6.     KARI's physical infrastructure has been rehabilitated and expanded in past years&#13;
(including under NARP I) and is now reasonably adequate though a small part of the&#13;
construction/rehabilitation program remains to be completed. The remainder of the program would&#13;
be implemented under NARP II.&#13;
7.    KARI's most important asset is its highly trained human resources. At reorganization,&#13;
KARI had a staff compliment of approximately 6,200, comprising 576 scientist, most of them with&#13;
bachelors and masters degrees At present, the number of staff has decreased to 5307. The number&#13;
of scientists also decreased to 537 scientists but the number with PhD degrees has increased by 30&#13;
percent, with MSc degrees by 50 percent and those with B.Sc. degrees down to 20 percent.&#13;

KARI's training program has, therefore, been successful in upgrading the qualifications and skill&#13;
of the scientist. Under NARP II, a special focus will be given to upgrading the skills of technical&#13;
and administrative staff.&#13;
Financial Resources&#13;
8.    KARI is supported by the Government of Kenya (GOK) and a number of multi-lateral and&#13;
bilateral donors. The total GOK support to KARI for personnel emoluments, recurrent operating&#13;
and development cash book expenditure has increased from KSh 275.7 million to KSh 677.5&#13;
million form 1990 to 1994. The Donors that have supported KARI over the last 10 years include&#13;
the World Bank, the European Union (EU), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),&#13;
Overseas Development Agency (ODA), Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA),&#13;
United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Government of the Netherlands&#13;
(GON), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), United Nations Development&#13;
Program (UNDP) and the Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR).&#13;
Total donor contribution to KARI amounted to KSh 178.7 million in 1993/94 financial year. The&#13;
total support from the GOK and donors amounted to KSh 856.3 million. KARI is allowed to use&#13;
income generated from its operations to augment its budget for non-salary recurrent cost. KARI&#13;
earned KSh 12 million in 1990 which rose to KSh 24 million in 1993/94.&#13;

KENYA&#13;
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT-PHASE II (NARP II)&#13;
Private Sector Role&#13;
As part of the Government's broad strategy for transition to a market-oriented economy, and in&#13;
the context of severe public sector resource constraints, the private sector is being encouraged to assume&#13;
responsibility for the types of agricultural research for which it is suited (e.g. research on cash crops),&#13;
while the public sector is focusing its efforts on the highest priorities in those areas where the private&#13;
sector is unlikely to contribute (particularly food crops).&#13;
Several mechanisms are being developed to increase private sector involvement in agricultural&#13;
research. Some of these (especially for industrial crops) have been tested and serve as models for future&#13;
efforts, while others (cost-sharing arrangements) are still in the early stages of testing. Tea and coffee&#13;
research is already fully funded by the private sector, through a cess on exports. This model, with&#13;
appropriate modifications, has been applied to sugar research, which will shortly be supported&#13;
completely by the private sector. The model is also being adapted to research on pyrethrum, cotton,&#13;
oilseeds, and horticultural crops. Barley is an important dual-purpose crop, for beer production and as&#13;
a food staple, and research can be supported by the private sector along the industrial crop model and&#13;
also on cost-sharing arrangements. Building on the barley experience, efforts will be expanded to&#13;
introduce cost-sharing arrangements with local farmers' unions and informal groups for staple crops&#13;
such as maize, sorghum, and millet.&#13;
TIhe Agricultural Research Fund (ARF), which is to be restructured and expanded under the&#13;
proposed project, is an important mechanism for fostering partnerships among stakeholders in the public&#13;
sector, the academic community, the processing industries, and producers. Under new operating&#13;
guidelines, research proposals would be funded on a competitive basis, with weight given to proposals&#13;
based on such partnerships.&#13;
The ultimate objective is to establish an integrated agricultural research system consisting of&#13;
mutually-supporting entities in the public and private sectors. The private-sector stakeholders will&#13;
assume increasing responsibility for research in their own interest, while the public sector will remain&#13;
closely involved through a network of relationships, and will continue to carry primary responsibility in&#13;
specific areas.&#13;
Sugar&#13;
Private sector responsibility for sugarcane research is already well-advanced. The Sugar&#13;
Industry Group (SIG) presently funds about 60 percent of the recurrent costs of sugarcane research&#13;
undertaken by KARI and also supports some private sector research. The proposed agreement between&#13;
SIG and KARI provides for assumption of full responsibility for research by SIG within 3 years. Under&#13;
the terms of this agreement, KARI would continue to undertake the bulk of the research, but on a&#13;
contract basis. Over time, SIG expects to expand the use of the contract mechanism to support research&#13;
on problems of particular concern to the industry by a range of researchers in the public and private&#13;
sectors. Together with the tea and coffee models, sugarcane research provides an example of&#13;
arrangements to be introduced for other industrial crops. Because SIG has the capacity to assume full&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
responsibility for relevant research, no incremental support would be provided under the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
Pyrethrum&#13;
At present, the Pyrethrum Board of Kenya (PBK) finances about 40% of the recurrent costs of&#13;
pyrethrum research undertaken by KARI. During the transitional phase to be supported under the&#13;
proposed project, research would be rationalized and focused on the highest priorities, and,&#13;
simultaneously, PBK and the industry would assume an increasing responsibility for the research. By&#13;
the end of the project period, the would have full responsibility for research, and no further direct public&#13;
sector support would be provided.&#13;
Cotton&#13;
Government is considering a proposal to establish a Cotton Development Council representing&#13;
the primary stakeholders in the cotton and textile industries, which would have funds at its disposal to&#13;
support cotton research. In order to provide a transition between the low level of cotton research at&#13;
present and the expanded system of research to be supported by the CDC (and also directly by the&#13;
cotton and textile industries), the proposed project would support cotton research on a declining basis.&#13;
It is expected that CDC and the industries would assume full responsibility for cotton research by the&#13;
end of the project period.&#13;
Oilseeds&#13;
Governnent is considering a proposal to establish an Oilseed Development Council&#13;
representing the various groups of stakeholders and to allocate revenue from import duties on oilseeds&#13;
and oilseed products to an Oilseeds Development Fund (ODF). Among other things, the ODF would be&#13;
used to finance research on oilseed production which, initially, is likely to be carried out by KARI under&#13;
contract. As oilseed production develops from its minimal level at present, and as the ODF comes into&#13;
operation, direct public sector funding of oilseed research would be phased out. The proposed project&#13;
would support oilseed research by KARI during this transition phase and establish the foundation on&#13;
which ODF-funded research would build. It is expected that all oilseed research would be funded by&#13;
ODF (and, in part, directly by the industry) by the end of the project period.&#13;
Horticulture&#13;
Horticulture is a thriving industry which provides substantial amounts of exports (fruit, Asian&#13;
vegetables, and flowers), but it is also a widely diverse industry in which the export segments are much&#13;
better able to support related research than those producing for the domestic market. Therefore the&#13;
strategy for private sector support of research is also diverse. In the case of export crops, the&#13;
Horticultural Crops Development Authority (HCDA) comprising producers and processors, has been&#13;
providing assistance in the promotion and development of export markets and limited amounts of&#13;
funding for research undertaken by KARI. It would assume full responsibility for research over the&#13;
course of the project period.&#13;
Producers aiming primarily at the domestic market are not nearly as well organized, although&#13;
local associations exist which are expected to gather strength over time. In this case, most of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
research has been undertaken by KARI with public sector funding. Nevertheless, the rudimentary local&#13;
associations provide a mechanism for cost-sharing of research, which KARI has begun to explore and&#13;
which seems to hold considerable promise for the future. KARI, therefore, intends to expand this&#13;
arrangement during the project period, in terms of both the number of crops, the geographical area, and&#13;
the proportion of cost borne by the associations. This arrangement for horticulture crops represents a&#13;
model for cost sharing that KARI intends to utilize for staple crops, as well. By the end of the project&#13;
period, it is expected that private producers and processors will be funding a significant proportion of&#13;
research for a number of horticulture crops, although some public sector support is likely to be needed&#13;
over the longer term.&#13;
Staple Crops&#13;
Barley. This crop represents a special case, since it is used by Kenya Breweries and it is also a&#13;
staple food crop. Kenya Breweries has long supported research (undertaken mostly by KARI) on&#13;
varieties of barley utilized for beer production. This arrangement will be continued on a contract basis,&#13;
and the contract mechanism is expected to be expanded over time to cover research undertaken by a&#13;
range of public and private sector researchers. Research on barley used for food will require public&#13;
sector support on an extended basis. However, since many farmers produce barley for both beer and&#13;
food consumption, there is an opportunity to "piggy-back" cost sharing arrangements for food barley&#13;
research on existing arrangements for beer barley research. With the dual-purpose farmers as a&#13;
nucleus, associations of barley producers are being forned which have the potential to fund part of the&#13;
cost of food barley research. Research on problems of particular concern to producers will be&#13;
undertaken by KARI under agreements with associations, which will specify the cost-sharing&#13;
arrangements for each case. KARI intends to expand the use of such agreements over the course of the&#13;
project period, and to fund a significant portion of food barley research in this manner by the end of the&#13;
project period. It also intends to build on this experience in introducing similar arrangements for other&#13;
staple crops.&#13;
Cost Sharing Mechanism. Producers of maize, sorghum, millet, and other staple crops&#13;
generally are not organized into producers' associations, and the farmer unions (with local, district, and&#13;
national chapters) have been engaged primarily in lobbying activities. Nevertheless, KARI has had&#13;
discussions with the unions about problems of particular concern to producers and possible cost-sharing&#13;
arrangements, and feels that there is some potential for agreements with local unions. It will pursue&#13;
these discussions further during the project, with a view to introducing agreements for on-station and&#13;
on-farm research on a cost-sharing basis. In addition, there are various infornal farmer groups (e.g.&#13;
women's groups) that may have potential as counter-parties for research on problems of local concern,&#13;
in terms of designing and implementing research (primarily on-farm) and contributing to the cost of&#13;
such research. These arrangements will build on existing arrangements with individual farmers for on-&#13;
farm research, under which the farmer typically contributes his/her labor, while KARI covers the&#13;
remaining costs. KARI is attempting to extend such arrangements to farmer groups. Over the longer&#13;
term, it is envisaged that farmer unions and groups also will begin to contract with private researchers&#13;
to address particular problems.&#13;

National Agricultural Research Project Phase II&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
General&#13;
1.    The economic analysis of the NARP II is performed along the lines of a conventional&#13;
cost/benefit analysis. The contribution by the project to the Kenyan economy is expressed in terms of&#13;
the economic rate of return (ERR), by allowing for a cash flow which includes only project specific&#13;
costs (investment, recurrent and replacement) and benefits (from incremental production). The&#13;
economic analysis is carried out in constant 1995 prices expressed in US dollars. The sensitivity&#13;
analyses of costs and benefits, are summarized in the form of the switching values.&#13;
2.     The economic value of the investment and the recurrent costs are derived from the financial&#13;
project cost estimates by excluding all taxes, duties, subsidies and other forms of transfer payments, as&#13;
well as price contingencies. All recurrent costs which are not incremental are excluded from the&#13;
economic costs; costs of relevant replacements, as well as the residual value of the investment, have&#13;
been accounted for in the cash flow.&#13;
3.    The benefits of the project are expressed in terms of the net value added by the incremental&#13;
production resulting from the investment. The benefits are obtained by allowing for analysis of&#13;
development in relevant agriculture production, in both the with project and the without project&#13;
scenarios. The project provides support for institution building, research on crop, livestock and&#13;
enviromnental management, and a pilot seed program. In the absence of sufficient data relating to crops&#13;
other than food grains, livestock, and environmental management programs, only benefits resulting from&#13;
food grains research are used in the economic analysis. It is assumed that incremental food grains&#13;
production would substitute for food grains imports. The incremental production has been priced using&#13;
the Bank's commodity price forecasts, the costs of shipping and insurance charges, as well as the&#13;
handling and transport costs between port of import and the farm.&#13;
Costs&#13;
4.     The economic costs of the project are estimated at US$96.4 million. They exclude salaries and&#13;
emoluments of research staff who would be in place in the without project and the with project situation&#13;
alike. The consolidated (net) investment and operation and maintenance costs are shown in Table 1,&#13;
column 1 (entire NARP II) and column 2 (food grains research under NARP II).&#13;
BenefitA&#13;
5.    General. The benefits of the project are anticipated to come in the form of incremental&#13;
production of food grains (maize, wheat, sorghum and millet) and other crops (cotton, oil crops, root&#13;
crops, horticultural crops), livestock products (meat and milk), improved animal health, and improved&#13;
natural resource management. Other than food grains, information on the quantifiable indicators of the&#13;

management research are limited or unavailable to carry out reliable economic analyses. Therefore, the&#13;
focus of the economic analysis has been confined to food grains research. The analysis is expc,ted to&#13;
provide some indication of the benefits that would be derived from all research activities supported by&#13;
the project, by using the information available for the food grains research program.&#13;

6.     Area under food grains. Several statistical sources' point to difference in the areas under major&#13;
food grains in Kenya. Variations in cultivated areas are considerable according to these sources.&#13;
However, it appears reasonable to set the yearly cultivated area under food grains at about 2.1 million&#13;

hectares, which is close to the figures given by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The major food&#13;
grains are distributed as follows: maize, with 1.8 million hectares is the major crop, followed by wheat,&#13;
sorghum, and millet, each of which is cultivated on 0.1 million hectares. The total cultivated area of&#13;
food grains is maintained constant in the without project as well as the with project scenario, in the&#13;
partial economic analysis involving only food grain research,.&#13;
7.     Yields of major food grains. Average yields for the major food grains vary by statistical&#13;
source. CBS data indicate that the yield for maize averages nation wide at about 1.0 ton per ha, while&#13;
the same source states about 0.4 ton per ha for millet, 0.4 ton per ha for sorghum, and 2.0 ton per ha.&#13;
for wheat. A recently published report by the Kenya Agriculture Research Institute (KARl)2 confirms&#13;
that the trend in average annual yield increases (aggregated on a country-wide basis) for major food&#13;
crops such as maize, wheat, sorghum and millet have been decreasing. This negative trends are due&#13;
mainly to expansion into less productive areas with marginal environments for crop cultivation, rather&#13;
than by detriorating yields in medium and high potential areas. The adverse effect on national yields&#13;
resulting from an expansion of cropping activities into marginal lands is, however, irrelevant to the&#13;
analysis as cultivated area and cropping pattern are maintained constant to the base year (Year 0), in&#13;
the with and without project scenarios.&#13;
8.     Relevant crop yields are summarized in Table 2, below, for the target years of the without&#13;
prject and the with project situation. It can be seen from this table that the average yields would&#13;
increase at the same pace, both in the without project and in the with project situation, during the initial&#13;
five project years. It is assumed that such increase would be due exclusively to an expanding adoption&#13;
rate by farmers of recommendations based on the results of research which was done outside the scope&#13;
of the proposed NARP II research program. The adoption rate increase from 2.5 percent in Year 6 to&#13;
37 percent in Year 10 for improved food grains technology developed under NARP II, used in the&#13;
calculations are quite conservative considering that where hybrids/improved varieties have been&#13;
introduced in Kenya, adoption rates of up to 90 percent have been observed.&#13;
9.    It is further assumed that from Year 6 onwards yields would continue to increase, both in the&#13;
with project and without project scenario. In the without project scenario, the increase in yield would&#13;
result mainly from enhanced utilization of technology packages which were recommended prior to Year&#13;
6. Yields would further increase during Years 6 to 10 of the project, due to the introduction of&#13;
improved technologies which would be generated by NARP II research. The improved technologies&#13;
would be disseminated by the existing extension staff as part of the on-going extension program.&#13;
10.    Details on the development of the benefit stream are shown in Table 3. The benefits, expressed&#13;
in terms of incremental net value added from food crop production, are calculated by assuming that&#13;
farmers will progressively adopt technology developed during the 5 years of NARP II.&#13;

11.   As shown in Table 3, the NARP II technology would for the first time be adopted in Year 6 on&#13;
an area equivalent to 2.5 percent of the total cultivated area (52,500 out of 2,100,000 hectares planted&#13;
to food grains); it is assumed that the area to benefit from the NARP II technology would expand&#13;
gradually by an additional 2.5 percent (i.e., by 5 percent in Year 2, by 7.5 percent in Year 3, etc.) of&#13;
total cultivated area, in each of the following 4 years up to Year 10. The total area to benefit from&#13;
NARP II technology would be equivalent to 37.5 percent in Year 10 (or 787,500 out of 2,100,000&#13;
hectares), and remain constant at this level in the years thereafter. Application of the NARP II&#13;
technology at the farm level would require additional inputs, the nature and cost of which are presently&#13;
unknown. In the absence of detailed crop budgets, it is assumed that the incremental costs of production&#13;
would be equivalent to 40 percent of the value of incremental production (value: cost ratio of 2.5).&#13;
Incremental production is valued at an import parity price of US$ 180 per ton of food grains (farngate&#13;
level).&#13;
Net Benefit Flow, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
12.   The total flow of incremental costs and benefits, as well as the resulting stream of net benefits is&#13;
shown in Table 1. The limited economic analysis, which focuses solely on the costs and benefits&#13;
associated with food grains research, reveals an ERR of 24 percent, and a net present value (NPV) of&#13;
US$ 70.3 million (discounted at 12 percent). As evidenced by the switching values, the economic return&#13;
of food grains research is robust. The switching values indicate that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 5 of 5&#13;
the cost of research on food grains could increase by 155 percent, or alternatively, that the food grains&#13;
research benefits could drop by 61 percent, and the ERR would still be equal to the OCC or 12 percent.&#13;

13.    The economic analysis shows that the overall economic rate of return of the project, calculated&#13;
by allowing for total project costs (including the costs of cotton, oil crops, horticultural crops, livestock&#13;
and natural resource management research) and using only the benefits from food grains research,&#13;
would at least equal 15 percent. In this case the switching values indicate that the benefits from food&#13;
grains research could decrease by 18 percent (assuming the highly unlikely event that (gross) benefits&#13;
from other research would be nil) or altematively overall costs could increase by 22 percent, and the&#13;
ERR would still be equal to the OCC. It is concluded that NARP II is very likely to attain an ERR in&#13;
excess of the OCC, and is, therefore, an economically viable project.&#13;

            The objectives of the National
            Agricultural Research Project - Phase II (NARP II) are to
            contribute to food security, poverty alleviation, and
            environmental protection by raising agricultural
            productivity and incomes, particularly those of women and
            small farmers, on a sustained basis.  The project consists
            of three main components: a) institution building-emphasis
            on enhanced research management, financial management, human
            resource development, and an upgraded information system;
            b)research program implementation  decentralized to centers
            progressively given authority and responsibility for
            extension outreach; and c) a seeds program- a pilot scheme
            to improve the quality, quantity, and delivery of basic and
            commercial seeds.
