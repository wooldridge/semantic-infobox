HYDROCARBON SECTOR REFORM AND CAPITALIZATION&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
I.  SECTOR OVERVIEW&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Bolivia's oil and gas sector has strong potential for attracting foreign direct investment and&#13;
providing needed economic growth. However, for the last decade, it has not seen major progress&#13;
partly because of the overwhelming predominance of the State through its national company,&#13;
Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), and the limnited attractiveness of the&#13;
Hydrocarbons Law.&#13;
Salient Facts about the Sector&#13;
2.    During the last decade, the following elements characterized the hydrocarbon sector in Bolivia:&#13;
* steady decline in the production of liquids until the end of 1986 with an increase in 1994&#13;
and renewal of exports at the end of 1993.&#13;
-  stable production and export of natural gas to Argentina but steady decline in the price.&#13;
*  decline in the number of companies exploring in the country until 1988 and an increase of&#13;
interest in Bolivia after 1990 new Hydrocarbons Law.&#13;
*  weakening of Govemment institutions dealing with the sector.&#13;
*  deterioration of YPFB's finances, and liquidity.&#13;
*  over-taxation of YPFB in the form of transfers of surplus to the Treasury.&#13;
*  considerable goverment interference in YPFB's day-to-day operations.&#13;
*  some degree of politicization and demoralization of YPFB's personnel.&#13;
3.    High inflation and political instability in the country, particularly in the early part of the 1980s,&#13;
have exacerbated the problems of the hydrocarbon sector. In addition, YPFB has experienced long&#13;
and frequent delays in being paid by Argentina for its gas sales to YPF -- more than six months at&#13;
times. This situation has led YPFB to delay its payments to its suppliers of natural gas and liquids, and&#13;
to the service contractors. By the end of the decade, YPFB was the major company exploring in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
country. However, after the promulgation of the new Hydrocarbons Law in November 1990, new&#13;
interest in Bolivia emerged again, particularly with Brazil natural gas market potential .&#13;
4.    Exploration. As of April 1995, there were 15 operations contracts, three secondary recovery&#13;
contracts and three association contracts. While this foreign participation in exploration is&#13;
encouraging, it remains modest compared to the country natural gas potential, and the relative success&#13;
obtained by the neighboring countries such as Argentina, Peru, and Colombia where the number of&#13;
contracts signed is much more important and the areas under exploration cover a large part of the&#13;
sedimentary basins of these countries. Furthermore, these contracts did not result in significant&#13;
investments to stimulate the sector. In 1992, investments by oil companies reached US$150 million of&#13;
which only US$76 million were in exploration. The number of oil companies including those operating&#13;
under secondary recovery contracts reached twenty five by April 1995. These companies control&#13;
about 24 blocks with an area of about 14 million hectares (about 23 percent of total potential&#13;
acreage), while YPFB controls 26 blocks with an area of about 7.4 million hectares (about 12 percent&#13;
of total). The signing of the natural gas sale purchase agreements between Bolivia and Brazil in&#13;
August 1988 -- which was replaced by the one of October 1991 -- has created a renewed interest in&#13;
Bolivia as a potential supplier of natural gas. This interest increased further after the signing of joint-&#13;
venture agreements in July 1994 between YPFB and ENRON, and YPFB and BHP Petroleum for&#13;
natural gas exports to Brazil and Chile, respectively. Interest in exploration will increase as a result of&#13;
these last agreements and the likelihood of an export market for natural gas.&#13;
5.    Reserves and Production. As of January 1995, were 56.9 there were 59 known oil and gas&#13;
fields with remaining recoverable reserves in Bolivia. The geographical distribution of the fields where&#13;
YPFB operates is as follows: 21 fields in the Area Boomerang-Chapare; 11 fields in the Central Area;&#13;
and 16 fields in the southern part of the country. Private contractors, or "contratistas" operate the&#13;
remaining 11 fields. These fields as well as the quasi totality of the exploratory efforts are in the area&#13;
known as the "Area Tradicional", covering nearly one third of Bolivia. As of January 1995, the&#13;
remaining proven oil and condensate reserves were 56.9 million barrel (MMBbl) and 71.3 MMBbl,&#13;
respectively. The remaining proven gas reserves were 3.8 trillion cubic feet (TCF) while the probable&#13;
gas reserves were 2.5 TCF. YPFB own production is about eighty percent of the total natural gas&#13;
production and about seventy percent of total liquids' production. Total production peaked in 1973 at&#13;
47,000 barrels per day (BD) declining thereafter to less than 22,000 BD in 1986. Recent discoveries in&#13;
the Chapare Area have helped increase the production to about 32,000 BD in 1995. The natural gas&#13;
reserves base, while important, needs to be increased to support export of large volumes of natural gas&#13;
to Brazil, Argentina and possibly Paraguay and Chile.&#13;
6.    Drilling. As of February 1995, YPFB's Drilling Department, staffed with 917 employees or&#13;
about 18.8 percent of total YPFB's staff, is the company's largest department. YPFB owns and&#13;
operates nine drilling rigs and ten work over rigs. According to a recent evaluation of these rigs by&#13;
Petro-Canada, only two rigs are new and nine are considered in good shape with nine being thirty two&#13;
years and older. The equipment has a variety of manufacturers and is costly to maintain and operate.&#13;
Field drilling personnel have solid experience and know-how, but, overall operational equipment/tools&#13;
are either obsolete or inadequate, making drilling costly. In comparison with private drilling companies&#13;
operating in Bolivia, YPFB's drilling cost is high.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
7.    Refining. YPFB's refining available capacity is substantially higher than petroleum product&#13;
demand; it amounts to 50,000 BD compared to a demand of 26,000 BD. The breakdown by refinery&#13;
is: Sucre 3,000 BD (reprocessing only), Cochabamba 27,000 BD and Santa Cruz 20.000 BD. The&#13;
production of refined petroleum products from three domestic refineries is approximately in balance&#13;
with demand on a total product basis. Currently there are individual product imbalances, particularly&#13;
small surpluses of gasoline, and shortages of diesel oil. These are due basically to the nature of the&#13;
domestic crude produced, and to some extent, the limitations of refinery configuration. The plants are&#13;
simple hydro-skimming refineries, designed to process the light, sweet crude and condensates which&#13;
the country produces. Refineries produce about a quarter of the LPG consumed, and the balance&#13;
comes from field gas plants. It does not appear that there will be a need to expand capacity or to build&#13;
conversion capacity in the foreseeable future.&#13;
8.    Distribution and Marketing. YPFB has a ownership of thirty bulk storage depots with&#13;
loading racks, fifty three kerosene outlets, seven large LPG bottling plants and nineteen small one sixty&#13;
three service stations (but operates only four), no road tankers, and one hundred and thirty three rail&#13;
tank cars. The private sector owns and operate more than 171 service stations, and all river barges and&#13;
tugs. YPFB performance in this area is quite satisfactory. Supply and distribution were never&#13;
interrupted. However, marketing cost is high and investments for maintenance and modernization of&#13;
installations were low, particularly during the last five years.&#13;
9.    YPFB's Finances. YPFB's 1993 domestic sales amounted to about Bs2.067 billion while&#13;
export, mostly natural gas to Argentina, amounted to about Bs604.9 million, the equivalent of US$451&#13;
million and US$132 million, respectively. Net profit amounted to about US$200 million. Total fixed&#13;
assets were equal to about Bs3.655 billion, equivalent to about US$798 million of which production&#13;
and gas plants represented fifty six percent, refining more than seven percent and pipeline twenty six&#13;
percent. YPFB's long term debt stood at Bsl.412 billion equivalent to about US$308 million.&#13;
Operating costs are considered high and liquidity of YPFB is poor.&#13;
H.    HYDROCARBON SECTOR ISSUES&#13;
Sector Structure&#13;
10.   Presently, the Government is the policy maker, the regulator and, as indicated above, the sole&#13;
shareholder of YPFB. The National Secretariat of Energy (NSE) has supervisory authority for the&#13;
hydrocarbon sector in the areas of policy making, regulation and coordination. The Directorate of&#13;
Energy and Hydrocarbons (DGH), within NSE, exercises these functions by monitoring, regulating and&#13;
enforcing the Hydrocarbons Law and related regulations. But DGH lacks the human and financial&#13;
resources as well as the expertise and experience to do its job effectively. Moreover, the ability of NSE&#13;
to influence YPFB and overall hydrocarbon policy is very limited. Under this structure NSE and DGH&#13;
have had only very limited leverage in dealing with YPFB, and limited authority to perform their&#13;
respective roles adequately.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Legal and Regulatory Framework&#13;
11.   The Hydrocarbons Law of November 1990 is the legal document that established the policy&#13;
and organization of the sector. This law was an improvement over the 1972 Hydrocarbon Law. It did&#13;
open pipeline and downstream activities to the private sector participation, but has maintained YPFB's&#13;
monopoly in upstream activities, i.e. exploration and production (E&amp;P), allowing for the entry of the&#13;
private sector through operations and/or association contracts. But since its enactment, the&#13;
Government has not taken all the required steps to promote private investment in exploration or&#13;
introduce a transparent bidding system. Moreover, the Government has neither changed the present&#13;
role nor ownership of YPFB's, except for the following: introduction of an enhanced secondary&#13;
recovery contract; the opening of marketing outlets under concession or supply agreement with YPFB;&#13;
and the establishment of private natural gas distribution companies.&#13;
12.   Operations and Association Contracts. The Hydrocarbon Law grants YPFB monopolistic&#13;
control of exploration and production in the country. It also provides for two types of contract, under&#13;
which investors may conduct exploration and production activities in Bolivia:&#13;
*  The Operations Contract. The basis of this contract is the 1971 Peruvian model (no&#13;
longer in use) under which there is approximately a 50/50 sharing of measured gross&#13;
production, with the contractor bearing all costs up to the "fiscalization - i.e supervision for&#13;
compliance" or metering point but with all taxes deemed included in the State company's&#13;
share.&#13;
*  The Association Contract. This contract is not based on any international precedent. It&#13;
is essentially an operations contract with a superimposed equity participation option for&#13;
YPFB, should it elect to participate in the development and production of a commercial&#13;
discovery. Unlike the operations contract, it does not provide any new incentives. To&#13;
date, only three association contracts have been signed, primarily for two reasons: (a) the&#13;
relative un-attractiveness of the deal on a risk-weighted basis in comparison to what is&#13;
available in other countries; and (b) private investor concerns that YPFB may have&#13;
difficulty funding its share of development costs.&#13;
13.   It is mainly the taxation regime of this law that hinders Bolivian competitiveness. Bolivia is&#13;
mostly known as a gas prone country with potential of discovery in the proven traditional basins of&#13;
only small oil and gas condensate fields. In addition, the law has several other weaknesses that&#13;
discourage private foreign direct investment, among which: (i) the limited and inflexible contractual&#13;
arrangements for upstream operations, i.e. exploration and production by obligating the foreign&#13;
investor to be a partner of YPFB; (ii) no free disposition, export and import of crude oil, petroleum&#13;
products and natural gas; and (iii) control by the government of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum&#13;
products prices which create economic distortions and dis-incentives for investment.&#13;
14.   Petroleum Regulations. With the assistance of UNDP, the previous Ministry of Energy and&#13;
Hydrocarbons prepared more than 17 draft regulations implementing the new Hydrocarbons Law and&#13;
dealing, among other things, with storage and distribution, oil blending service stations, compressed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
natural gas, transportation of liquids by pipeline. IDA was requested to comment on these drafts.&#13;
Only six were issued. In general, they were rigid, very restrictive and continue to lend too much&#13;
authority to and interference by YPFB. New regulations need to be drafted when the new&#13;
Hydrocarbons Law is approved by the National Congress (NC). In addition to this work, IDA with&#13;
funding from ESMAP, provided technical assistance for a study to analyze the economics of natural&#13;
gas distribution in Bolivia, and the drafting of a gas code to: (i) promote substitution of LPG and diesel&#13;
domestically; (ii) stimulate private sector participation in this activity, (iii) design the structure,&#13;
authority, and responsibilities of the Government in this area; (iv) define broad principles for natural gas&#13;
exports; (v) design tariff-setting principles, parameters, mechanisms for investors; and (vi) define rules&#13;
for common access to gas pipeline transport and taxes on the end use of natural gas. The new&#13;
administration that took office in August 1993 opted to have a single new Hydrocarbons Law which is&#13;
under preparation and which would incorporate the main principles included in the draft gas code.&#13;
Petroleum Products and Natural GasPricing and Taxation&#13;
15.    Prices for petroleum products, LPG and natural gas are set by the Govemment in accordance&#13;
to Article 75 of Decree 21060 and, in most cases as shown in the table below, are inconsistent with&#13;
intemational prices. In addition, there is no explicit taxing system for each product. The final prices of&#13;
petroleum products reflect an average price per composite barrel received by YPFB, augmented by an&#13;
important tax component calculated to satisfy the revenue needs of the Treasury.&#13;
Intemal Price  Opport. Pr.    Subsidy(-) or Tax(+)&#13;
Petroleum Product    US$/Barrel    US$/Barrel    Million $US Dollar&#13;
Special Gasoline          62.1             44.7           83.5&#13;
Premium Gasoline          90.6             46.1            5.5&#13;
Kerosene                  31.8             45.5           -1.5&#13;

Notc: Prices as of April 1995. Opportuniuty price includes import pfice plus transport. marketing and distribution margins.&#13;
This table shows non-explicit high taxes for gasoline in particular and large subsidies for LPG&#13;
and kerosene. This pricing and taxation system has created severe distortions for both producers and&#13;
consumers. In addition, it does not allow transparency of cost and prices at various levels of the&#13;
industry, resulting in cross-subsidization which in turn result in inefficiency in operations. These&#13;
aspects wvill be addressed by the reform program.&#13;
16.    Natural Gas Pricing and Taxation. While prices for natural gas export reflect competitive&#13;
open market prices at the Argentine-Bolivia border, the natural gas internal prices are set arbitrarily to&#13;
respond to continual pressures by ENDE, the Power Public Utility Company which is the major&#13;
consumer of natural gas and many special interest groups (private companies, labor unions, provinces&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
and public enterprises). They remain to be defined within the framework of the revised hydrocarbon&#13;
law and well designed natural gas regulations. Presently, this commodity is not explicitly taxed by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
17.   The Diagnostic Study of YPFB's operations and physical facilities have identified a number of&#13;
environmental issues: (i) weak environmental capability within the company and lack of experience; (ii)&#13;
weakness of institutions at NSE as well as at MOSDE with respect to environmental management,&#13;
including monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations; (iii) lack of environmental&#13;
regulations, operational guidelines and procedures within the company; (iv) lack of regulatory&#13;
capability and authority, and no viable means of enforcing regulations at the level of NSE as well as at&#13;
the level of MOSDE; (v) insufficient awareness and acceptance of the environmental impact on&#13;
operations within YPFB, NSE and MOSDE; (vi) environmental impact on areas accessed for seismic&#13;
and exploration drilling; (vii) gas flaring and related environmental impact such as noise; and (viii)&#13;
environmental impact resulting from new and more intense exploration and production activity. Other&#13;
environmental issues include:&#13;
*  impact of petroleum activities particularly exploration and production in remote rural areas&#13;
on indigenous people, wildlife, ecology and declared protected areas.&#13;
* above-ground pipelines and possible oil spills.&#13;
* lack of procedures, material, and equipment for emergency countermeasure.&#13;
18.   The study concluded that YPFB has had a poor environmental record in terms of protecting&#13;
the soil and subsoil, rivers, forests and air from effluent during all aspects of petroleum activities. The&#13;
proposed project will address identified problems in these areas. Two in-depth environmental audits of&#13;
all YPFB physical installations and operations are being carried out by two separate firms and a&#13;
mitigation plan will be developed to remedy most of the damages identified. These audits will extend&#13;
to areas covered by existing or potential private exploration and/or development projects and will also&#13;
address social as well as ecological issues of remote indigenous people. They will be reviewed by a&#13;
legal consultant to determine their implications and Government's responsibility. The Government has&#13;
already indicated that it intends to assume responsibility for all such environmental concern. The&#13;
Government also intends to implement the recommendations of these environmental audits.&#13;
19.   The Government recognizes that, if it does not adequately address the environmental problems&#13;
that petroleum operations cause and the related measures required to protect indigenous people,&#13;
serious consequences would occur and would have negative repercussions which would hinder further&#13;
private oil exploration. In addition, the Government is also aware of the need to address current flows&#13;
and installations design issues and their environmental and social impacts. The project will address&#13;
these issues through the promulgation of a defined set of petroleum regulations, norms, operational&#13;
guidelines, and provision of training of personnel in NSE as well as in MOSDE. Furthermore, the&#13;
establishment of working group in NSE dedicated to environmental aspects and supported by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
environmental experts which will lead to the establishment of an Environmental Unit in NSE will&#13;
address these issues. Funds from the credit will be provided to carry out these tasks in coordination&#13;
with those which are planned for addressing environmental issues in the power sector. These tasks&#13;
will be carried out in close coordination and under the guidance and leadership of the MOSDE and in&#13;
cooperation with the oil companies. More details are provided in Attachment 1.&#13;
Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB)&#13;
20.   Role of YPFB. YPFB as a state company plays a dominant role in the petroleum industry in&#13;
Bolivia. By far, it is the oldest company in the country. Private companies have used YPFB as a&#13;
reliable partner, a source of information and also as a source of help to carry out many of their&#13;
operations. With a fairly good discovery success ratio, it was able to provide the energy requirements&#13;
the country needs for its economic development. Although YPFB is in a privileged exploration&#13;
position it controls only 7.4 million hectares out of a total of about 69 million hectares of sedimentary&#13;
basins. However, because of Government budgetary constraints, YPFB cannot get the financial&#13;
resources to actively explore this acreage. The privileged position which YPFB hold stems from the&#13;
Hydrocarbons Law which grants it the monopoly in exploration and production, and a special role to&#13;
act on behalf of the state. In addition, YPFB is in a unique position of funding a significant portion of&#13;
the Government's budget. But this fiscal relationship to the state budget has also restricted its ability to&#13;
have the financial resources in order to plan and manage its investment programs and its operations in&#13;
general.&#13;
21.   Government Interference in YPFB Operations. Because of YPFB's predominant role in&#13;
the economy and the impact it has on local and regional business, many segments of the Government&#13;
have been interfering in its operations -- central, provincial and local Govemments as well as incumbent&#13;
political parties This interference covers: (i) appointment and dismissal of personnel; (ii) procurement&#13;
process; and (iii) insistence on continued operation of uneconomic units, such as the Sucre refinery.&#13;
This has caused productivity and efficiency to be low thus breeding instability among personnel and the&#13;
hiring of unnecessary personnel. However, since January 1994, YPFB's personnel has decline and as&#13;
of April 1995, its total work force decreased by about 12 percent.&#13;
III. GOVERNMENT POLICY ACTIONS&#13;
Government's Capitalization Policy Actions&#13;
22.   Significant policy measures have been taken in order to lay the foundation for the reform of the&#13;
sector and the capitalization of YPFB. These measures are characterized by the passage of three&#13;
important laws that open the way for the Government to implement its reform program. The first is&#13;
the Capitalization Law (Law No. 1544) which was approved by the NC on March 21, 1994. This&#13;
law, in particular, authorizes the Executive Office to: (i) transfer all assets of the public enterprises,&#13;
including YPFB, for the creation of " Sociedades de Economia Mixta" (MECs) or joint venture&#13;
companies; (ii) capitalize each public enterprises including YPFB through a Supreme Decree; (iii)&#13;
transfer the State shares in these MECs to the Bolivian citizens, age 21 and above; (iv) establish a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
"Fideicomiso" or Trust Fund which will be the depositoiy of these shares until the creation of Pension&#13;
Funds; and ()i) to let the Treasury assume, prior to sale, part or the whole financial liabilities of these&#13;
companies.&#13;
23.   The second law is the SIRESE Law (Law No. 1600) which was enacted recently on October&#13;
28, 1994 by the NC. This law defines the activities that will be regulated and the authority responsible&#13;
for regulations cnforcement as well as the mechanisms in case of litigation and complaints by either the&#13;
investor, the consumer or the public authority. It establishes a General Superintendency and five&#13;
Sectorial Superintendencies, among them that of the hydrocarbon sector. The law defines clearly the&#13;
functions and responsibilities of each of these units, their funding and the way the respective&#13;
Superintendent is designated.&#13;
24.    Finally, the third law is the General Tax Law (Law 1606) amending that of May 20, 1985 (Law&#13;
843), and which was enacted on December 22, 1994, by the NC. This Law establishes, in particular, a&#13;
new common corporate tax regime of 25 percent on taxable income for companies involved in&#13;
exploration, exploitation, refining, processing, pipeline transport and marketing. In addition, the law&#13;
introduces an excise tax on petroleum products which should not be in excess of Bs 1.50 per liter or&#13;
equivalent unit without specifying which products will be subjected to this tax. Regulations&#13;
implementing these laws will be promulgated in the near future. The passage of these fundamental&#13;
laws to achieve this program and the agreement on the Policy Framework Paper with the IMF are clear&#13;
signals of the Govemment commitment. They also establish a clearer framework for implementing this&#13;
T A and reflect a direction of reform whichi IDA agrees with.&#13;
Government's Hydrocarbons Sector Policy Actions&#13;
25.    These policy actions specific to the sector which were pledged by the Govemment and which&#13;
will be supported by this project include:&#13;
*  redefinition of the relative roles of the government --including central, province and local&#13;
(lovemments -- and the private sector in the hydrocarbons sector.&#13;
*  reorganization of the sector by the passage of a new Hydrocarbon Law, including an&#13;
internationally competitive fiscal regime and the promulgation of new regulations&#13;
implementing the law to attract private investment as the State withdraws from this sector.&#13;
a  r eform of the pricing and taxation system of petroleum products, LPG and natural gas, that&#13;
establishes explicit excise taxes on petroleum products. The new tax regime will help&#13;
restore price transparency at each stage of the industry, and thus, stimulate greater&#13;
competition in downstream operations.&#13;
*  capitalization of YPFB so that the resulting company or companies will compete fully in all&#13;
stages of the sector and have a contractual relationship with the Government for&#13;
exploration and production as well as pipelines, similar to any other private company. The&#13;
Government will open a portion of the exploration acreage presently held by YPFB to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
exploration by private companies, preferably through simple and attractive contractual&#13;
arrangements in the form of concession.&#13;
* issuance of environmental regulations, standards and norms that would be legally&#13;
enforceable as well as strengthening of Government capacity to monitor environmental&#13;
aspects of hydrocarbons activities and mitigate damages that may be identified by&#13;
environmental audits of YPFB.&#13;
26.    Draft of the Hydrocarbons Law is in final stage (see para. 31 below for more detail) before&#13;
submission to the cabinet and the NC. There are still some pending issues that need to be resolved.&#13;
These concern in particular the upstream (E&amp;P) fiscal regime, the organization of the sector, and the&#13;
future of existing Operations Contracts. The fiscal regime will be reexamined in the light of the new&#13;
General Tax Law discussed in para. 24 above. In particular, national royalty should be readjusted&#13;
upward to compensate for the low corporate tax rate approved by this law. However, the enactment&#13;
of the Hydrocarbons Law remains the most important building block to be put in place in order to&#13;
bring to fruition: (i) an adequate reorganization and governance of the sector that would capture the&#13;
economic rent and bring sufficient revenue to the government as well as long tenn sustainability and&#13;
stability of the sector; (ii) an environment which is competitive enough to attract major private sector&#13;
investment; and (iii) an acceptable trade off among all these considerations and those specifically&#13;
related to YPFB capitalization which are somewhat dependent on the way the sector will be&#13;
reorganized.&#13;
IV. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
27.    The Project includes the following three components:&#13;
(a)    Legal and Regulatory Framework This component will provide technical assistance&#13;

will include reviewing all legal aspects of natural gas distribution concessions and&#13;
identification of YPFB's financial and other liabilities arising from YPFB's current legal&#13;
relationship with natural gas distribution companies as a result of its wVithdrawal from&#13;
these companies pursuant to the capitalization process. The cost of this component is&#13;
about 6 percent of the total project cost.&#13;
(b)    Capitalization of YPFB. This component will provide technical assistance to the&#13;
MOC for designing a strategy and a master plan that would include measures leading to&#13;
the capitalization of YPFB It will include: (i) carrying out a technical and financial&#13;

the capitalization of each MEC and all required transactions; (x) carrying out an&#13;
information campaign directed to the personnel of YPFB's trade unions political parties&#13;
and the public at large about YPFB capitalization process and strategy in order to raise&#13;
public awareness and enhance public endorsement of the process; (xi) establishing data&#13;
rooms in Bolivia and outside to provide information, particularly to prospective&#13;
investors about YPFB, each MEC and the sector, (xii) defining and implementing a&#13;
marketing strategy for the capitalization of YPFB, including the required road shows'&#13;
with the assistance of an investment bank; and acquisition and utilization for all of the&#13;
above of office furniture and materials, computers, software, and equipment such as&#13;
printers, and photocopying and facsimile machines. The cost of this component is&#13;
about 43 percent of total project cost.&#13;
The cost of the "Retainer Fee" for the investment bank will be financed by the Regulatory Reform and&#13;
Capitalization 'FA Credit, while the cost of the "Success Fee" will be financed by the private strategic investor(s).&#13;
An amount of US$200,000 is included to cover activities not included in the TOR of the investment bank.&#13;

project cost.&#13;
Table I shows Project Cost and Financing by Beneficiary Agency. Table 2 shows Project&#13;
Performance Indicators. Table 3 shows Procurement and Disbursement Ar-angements, and&#13;
2 rhe content of this component depends on the new Hydrocarbons Law which will be enacted by the NC. This&#13;
law will determine how the sector will be organized and what should be the relations of this law with that of&#13;
SIRESE. The Government's objective is to limit the creation of many separate entities for the sector. Keeping this&#13;
uncertainty in mind, it is assumed that DGHi will be maintained and the creation of a small ENTE&#13;
&#13;

SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
28.   By ministerial resolution dated March 28, 1995, the Minister of Economic Development&#13;
established a Project Executing Unit (PEU) in NSE in charge of executing components " A" and " C"&#13;
(Legal and Regulatory Framework, and Institutional Strengthening) of the project. The Executive&#13;
Director of PEU was also appointed by another ministerial resolution dated April 17, 1995. He will be&#13;
reporting to the National Secretary of Energy. Furthermore, the NSE has already established four&#13;
small working groups during project preparation. These working groups are staffed with local&#13;
consultants supported, on an ad-hoc basis, by foreign consultants which are funded (initially by the&#13;
Japanese Grant Facility) by the PPF-727-0-BO. The first is in charge of carrying out component A.&#13;
The second is in charge of supporting the National Secretariat of Finance (NSOF) in the analysis of&#13;
petroleum prices deregulation and taxation. The third is in charge of carrying out component C which&#13;
concems the preparation for the restructuring and reorganization of the NSE, and organization of&#13;
HCS. Finally, the fourth group is still at its embryonic stage. It will be initially in charge of the&#13;
environmental unit organization study and will assist in the drafting of environmental regulations in&#13;
close coordination and cooperation with the NSONRE. This group will eventually include an&#13;
ecologist, a social scientist, engineers and a lawyer, all with experience in environmental aspects related&#13;
to the industry. It will lead to the establishment of an energy environmental unit in charge of&#13;
monitoring environmental matters not only for the hydrocarbon sector but also for power (with support&#13;
for the latter from the Power Reform and Capitalization Technical Assistance Project which is under&#13;
preparation). These working groups will be supported by long term advisors as well as short term&#13;
technical, financial and legal consultants.&#13;
29.   In addition, by ministerial resolution dated March 27, 1995 the Minister of Capitalization&#13;
established a Capitalization Unit (CAPU) and appointed its Executive Director. The Executive&#13;
Director will be reporting to the National Secretary of Capitalization in the Ministry of Capitalization.&#13;
CAPU is in charge of carrying out component " B" of the project and will be supported by long term&#13;
advisors as well as short term technical, financial and legal consultants. CAPU is physically located in,&#13;
and is receiving assistance from, YPFB but totally independent from YPFB's management as specified&#13;
by a special resolution of its Board of Directors dated May 11, 1995 which spells out clearly YPFB's&#13;
obligations toward the CAPU. Furthermore, CAPU will be advised by an Advisory Committee (AC)&#13;
which the Government will establish and which will be chaired by the Minister of Capitalization and&#13;
will include the Minister of Economic Development, the Minister of Finance, the National Secretary of&#13;
Energy, the National Secretary of Capitalization, the National Secretary of Natural Resources and&#13;
Environment and the President of YPFB. Figure 1 shows the Project Implementation&#13;
Organization Chart.&#13;
30.   Furthermore, to ensure successful and timely monitoring and control of project&#13;
implementation, agreement was reached on target date for project activities and performance indicators&#13;
shown in Schedule 1 (Summary of Project Activities and Timetable), and Table 2 (Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Performance Indicators). Schedule C of the Memorandum of the President shows the IDA&#13;
supervision plan. CAPU and PEU will submit to IDA semi-annual progress reports, respectively,&#13;
indicating implementation status of each project component, identifying problems and actions taken.&#13;
These reports will form the basis for IDA supervision missions (para 39).&#13;
Project Preparation Status&#13;
31. With regard to the Component 'A" of the project, Legal and Regulatory Framework the&#13;
NC has already approved the two main building blocks that would serve as a basis for the capitalization&#13;
of the six main public enterprises, including YPFB: the Capitalization Law and the SIRESE Law.&#13;
Wide ranging preparatory activities for the preparation of the Hydrocarbons Law and the fiscal regime&#13;
for E&amp;P were completed in March 1994 with the support of a Japanese Grant Facility for Yen 71&#13;
million, equivalent to US$550,000. Work continues in this area with the support of a PPF of US$1.0&#13;
million. In addition, during the technical negotiation of the CPAC the Bolivian Delegation agreed to&#13;
provide IDA with a draft Hydrocarbons Law which embodied basic principles which were agreed upon&#13;
and which are included as an annex in the Development Policy Letter. These basic principles are: (i)&#13;
free competition, and elimination of all monopolies and preferential treatment; (ii) rights of free&#13;
disposition of crude oil, natural gas and derivatives including freedom of import and export; (iii)&#13;
deregulation of prices except in the case of natural monopolies; (iv) the introduction of a fiscal regime&#13;
for upstream operations which is competitive with that of other countries in the region while meeting&#13;
Bolivia's fiscal needs; (v) elimination of direct and indirect barriers to entry, including the limited use of&#13;
concessions; ((vi) open access to pipelines for third parties, subject only to payment of a non-&#13;
discriminatory tarinff (vii) flexibility in contractual arrangements for exploration and production; (viii)&#13;
definition ofjurisdiction of HCS within the SIRESE; (ix) establishment of an appropriate independent&#13;
institution to promote E&amp;P investments, negotiate and administer E&amp;P contracts, manage E&amp;P Data&#13;
Bank Unit, assume rights and obligations under existing and future operations contracts, and monitor&#13;
strategic investor's minimum investment commitment for the capitalized YPFB; (x) no controls on&#13;
remittance abroad of proceeds of sales whether local or foreign; (xi) stability of tax and exchange&#13;
regimes to E&amp;P contractors for the duration of the contract or such changes as the contractor may&#13;
agree; (xii) authorization of measures necessary for the capitalization of YPFB; (xiii) existing contracts&#13;
will be honored and contractors will be offered the option of free disposition of natural gas and liquid&#13;
hydrocarbons; and (xiv) responsibility of environmental standards will be specified.&#13;
32.   With regard to the Component 'B" of the project, YPFB's Capitalization, two recent&#13;
ESMAP studies have been completed. The first dealt with several aspects: (i) upstream activities&#13;
(E&amp;P) and more specifically strategy for selection of exploration areas for a capitalized YPFB; (ii) level&#13;
of investments in existing producing fields for a capitalized YPFB and definition of core fields to be&#13;
retained by the MEC(s); and (iv)operations contracts economics and legal aspects related to YPFB's&#13;
capitalization strategy. This study was presented to the Government in July 1994. The main&#13;
recommendations of the study were to: (i) create two separate E&amp;P Business Units (BUs) or packages&#13;
that would include only core producing fields and few exploration blocks; (ii) maintain the existing&#13;
operations contracts with the State and not to grant to the Capitalized MEC the interest presently held&#13;
by the State; and (iii) establish four small investment packages which will include non core producing&#13;
fields and selected exploration blocks that would be offered for bids outside the capitalization process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
The second dealt with YPFB's Capitalization objectives, principles, criteria, options and strategy as&#13;
well as action plan. This study was based on interviews of 21 key ministers, national secretaries and&#13;
YPFB's top management. This study was presented to the Government and the President of Bolivia in&#13;
December 1994. It analyzed four packaging options which were defined along the line of traditional&#13;
BU which characterize the oil and natural gas industry. Each option considered the establishment of a&#13;
separate natural gas transmission company for the following reasons: (i) a large number of&#13;
interviewees recommended a separate gas transmission company; (ii) the objective of the Governnent&#13;
to make Bolivia a major player and a hub for the regional gas market and, transit and transport in the&#13;
Southern Cone and (iii) the need to have a credible open access transmission system which is&#13;
independent from the gas producers. Furthermore, the strategy involved a combination of&#13;
capitalization of core BUs with privatization of non essential BUs such as bulk storage of petroleum&#13;
products, rail and road transportation, marketing outlets, and services, particularly drilling and work&#13;
over. Option " A" includes one BU comprising one BU for E&amp;P integrated with the two refineries&#13;
and the petroleum product pipelines network. Option " B" includes one separate BU for E&amp;P, and&#13;
one separate BU comprising the two refineries and the petroleum product pipelines network. Option&#13;
" C" includes two separate BUs for E&amp;P of nearly the same size with regard to reserves, with one&#13;
E&amp;P BU integrated with the two refineries and the petroleum product pipeline network Finally, option&#13;
"D" includes two separate BUs for E&amp;P and one separate BU comprising the two refineries and the&#13;
petroleum product pipelines network The study recommended option " D" combined with a flexible&#13;
bidding process based on the same option in order to let the market determine the future structure of&#13;
the industry but with the restriction that producers cannot acquire a majority shareholding in the gas&#13;
transmission system.&#13;
33.   IDA endorsed the study conclusions and recommendations. In particular, IDA has expressed&#13;
to the Government that the option to capitalize YPFB "as is" i.e., as an integrated company, is the least&#13;
attractive when compared to all other options using the objectives and criteria of YPFB's&#13;
capitalization identified during the interviews. More specifically, IDA considers that this option should&#13;
not be considered because of the need to: (i) reduce the Capitalized YPFB's predominant market&#13;
position and introduce competition at all phases of the industry; (ii) reduce risks (commercial and&#13;
political) associated with the transformation of a quasi-state monopoly to a quasi-private monopoly;&#13;
(iii) increase the chances of success of the bidding process by offering more than one package, thus&#13;
giving more choices to the bidders to participate in the process, (iv) increase the number of potential&#13;
winners which will bring new technology and know how; (v) optimize capitalization value; and (vi)&#13;
add more credibility to the open access gas transmission system presently considered by the&#13;
Government. In addition, the combination of capitalization of core BUs with privatization of non core&#13;
BUs and the proceed from the sales would provide financial resources to set up a fund in order to&#13;
cover certain capitalization costs. Finally, IDA endorsed the Study recommendation to maintain the&#13;
existing operations contracts with the State.&#13;
34.   On April 1995, the Government submitted to IDA a letter in which it presented two&#13;
alternatives which were considered: (i) alternative I which is very sinrilar to option D discussed above;&#13;
and (ii) altemative 2 which includes three separate BU: one single E&amp;P but integrated with natural gas&#13;
transmission business unit, a separate refining BU with oil and product pipeline, and a marketing and&#13;
distribution BU which will not be privatized as recommended by the consultant but capitalized. IDA,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
in its response, indicated that alternative 2 will not be appropriate. With regard to Operations&#13;
Contracts, the Consultant recommended that they should remain with the State in order to maintain&#13;
stable long term government revenues. In the same letter mentioned above, the Government endorsed&#13;
this recommendation. The investment bank which will assist the Government in the finalization of its&#13;
capitalization strategy is on board and a decision is expected soon.&#13;
35.   With regard to the Component " C" of the project, Institutional Strengthening, NSE has&#13;
started preliminary reorganization work of the Secretariat using the various working groups it has&#13;
established (para. 28). However, this work is dependent on the enactment by the NC of the&#13;
Hydrocarbons Law which will determine how the sector will be organized and consequently how to&#13;
reorganize the Secretariat. Furthermore, with the technical assistance of CIDA, NSE and YPFB has&#13;
initiated preliminary work for the organization and establishment of the Data Bank Unit and the HCS&#13;
as well as for a two comprehensive environmental audits as well as the preliminary organization of the&#13;
HCS.&#13;
Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
36.   Procurement. The Procurement Unit which was established in MOC will be carrying out&#13;
procurement for CAPU for goods and services included in component " B". This unit does not need&#13;
any technical assistance under the project because it is already receiving technical assistance form the&#13;
Regulatory Reform and Capitalization Technical Assistance Credit which is disbursing. Furthermore, a&#13;
Supreme Decree enacted recently authorizes the MOC to procure directly under IDA guidelines but&#13;
without resorting to the Procurement Agencies and the fairly lengthy government procedure. PEU will&#13;
carry out its own procurement for goods and services included in components " A" and " C"&#13;
independently of CAPU, but under a different and new Supreme Decree enacted in April 1995 which&#13;
simplified the procedure by eliminating the procurement agencies. If needed, it will receive some&#13;
support form the procurement unit of MOC.&#13;
37.   The project will involve only two categories of procurement: (i) goods to be used for&#13;
implementation of capitalization and institutional strengthening components such as office equipment&#13;
(copying and fax machines), office furniture and materials, computer hardware and software and two&#13;
four-wheel drive (4WD) vehicles for the future environmental unit of NSE; and (ii) consultancy&#13;
services for: (a) the drafting of legal and regulatory framework; (b) the pre-capitalization studies and&#13;
capitalization transaction; and (c) the strengthening of NSE, including training of personnel. The&#13;
procurement of goods which the IDA credit will finance will take place according to: (i) International&#13;
Shopping for the procurement of office equipment, computer hardware and software and two 4WD&#13;
vehicles for an estimated amount of US$315,000 which, to the extent possible, will be packaged in&#13;
contracts of US$25,000 or more each but not exceeding US$ 100,000; and (ii) Local Shopping for&#13;
goods such as office furniture, supplies and materials, in packages of less than US$25,000 per contract.&#13;
Goods will be procured in accordance with the provisions of the " Guidelines for Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and credits (January 1995). The selection and hiring of consultants will follow&#13;
procedures consistent with "Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
(August 1981)". Contracts for goods will be subject to IDA post review requiring submission of full&#13;
documentation promptly after their signing and prior to delivery to IDA of the first application for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
withdrawal of funds from the Credit Account for ail contracts valued at US$25,000 or more, and ex-&#13;
post during supervision mission and on a random basis for all contracts valued less than US$25,000.&#13;
For consultancy contracts with consulting firms, valued at less than US$60,000 and with individual&#13;
consultants valued at less than US$30,000, IDA prior review will cover only TORs with requirement&#13;
to use model Letter of Invitation. Based on the above arrangements, IDA prior review will cover&#13;
about 80 percent of the contracts which the Credit will finance; which is satisfactory, given the nature&#13;
of the items to be financed.&#13;
38.   Disbursement. As detailed in Schedule B attached to the Memorandum of the President and&#13;
Table 3 in the Technical Annex disbursements would be made against: (a) 100 percent of net of tax&#13;
costs of local and foreign consultants; (b) 100 percent of training expenses; (c) 100 percent of CIF cost&#13;
of imported goods and of the ex-factory cost of local manufactured goods; and (d) 85% of the cost of&#13;
locally procured goods. Disbursements may be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOE's) for&#13;
the following expenditures: (a) contracts for goods valued US$25,000 equivalent or less; (b) contracts&#13;
with firms for services including technical assistance and training for US$60,000 equivalent or less and&#13;
contracts valued at US$30,000 or less per individual. For all contracts that exceed the amount&#13;
indicated above, frll documentation is required. The supporting documents for SOE's will be retained&#13;
by NSE and MOC, and will be available for review by supervision missions upon request. All other&#13;
requests for disbursements will require full documentation. Two Special Accounts will be established&#13;
in the Central Bank, one for MOC and the other for NSE. The total authorized allocation for both&#13;
Special Accounts would be US$900,000 to be shared one third and two third between PEU and&#13;
CAPU, respectively, with an initial deposit to be made of US$150,000 and US$350,000, respectively,&#13;
and a full amount authorized allocation to be released when disbursements reach a level of US$1.0&#13;
million and US$2.0 million, respectively. These amounts allocated for each Special Account and the&#13;
initial deposit to each account were confirmed during negotiations. Disbursements will be made under&#13;
authorized signatures from a designated representative of the Borrower. Retroactive financing for&#13;
consultancy services and related equipment procured under IDA guidelines after September 30, 1994&#13;
(but not more than one year after the date of signing) is proposed up to US$ 1.0 million equivalent to&#13;
about 10 percent of the proposed amount of the credit. During negotiations, Government assurance&#13;
were sought that withdrawal applications for replenishment of the Special Accounts will be prepared by&#13;
the irnplementing agencies in accordance with IDA policies and procedures. The project is expected&#13;
to be completed on June 30, 1998 and the closing date is December 31, 1998.&#13;
39.   Auditing and Reporting. Records and auditing will be the responsibility of each unit, the&#13;
PEU and CAPU, which will establish separate accounts for each component and will monitor all&#13;
expenditures financed by this project. The Bank which will be chosen will maintain separate records&#13;
for all transactions under this credit. Project Accounts, the two Special Accounts and Statements of&#13;
Expenditures will be audited each year by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA within 6 months&#13;
after the end of the fiscal year. In addition to financial auditing, PEU and CAPU will prepare separate&#13;
full progress reports and submit them to IDA every six month within the fourth week following the end&#13;
of each semester. This report will detail all project and related activities, report on the progress in&#13;
relation to agreed schedules and project milestones, and identify any problems which may have been&#13;
encountered and which could adversely affect the overall impact of the project. Detailed reporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
requirements will be established during the first supervision mission. These auditing and reporting&#13;
requirements were confirmed during negotiations.&#13;

BOLIVIA&#13;
HYDROCARBON SECTOR REFORM AND CAPITALIZATION&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Aspects: Issues and Action Plan&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I .    Environmental sub-components of the Hydrocarbon Sector Reform and Capitalization&#13;
Technical Assistance Project will help identify existing environmental problems in the industry and&#13;
provide measures to address them. This will include promulgation of environmental regulations,&#13;
definition of standards, norms and procedures, and strengthening of government institutions to monitor&#13;
activities in all phases of the sector. Furthermore, this will help improve environmental and risk&#13;
assessment and mitigate hazards affiliated with the industry as a whole and also with the capitalized&#13;
YPFB.&#13;
2.    Environmental sub-components will increase the efficiency of the NSE and the MOSDE in&#13;
environmental assessment of hydrocarbon-related activities, proposed public enterprise reforms and&#13;
private sector development. The Mining Sector is being reviewed under a project called&#13;
Environmental Technical Assistance Project and a new TA is under preparation. This experience will&#13;
assist the hydrocarbon sector. The cost of this sub-component is about 10.4 percent of total base cost.&#13;
Major Environmental Issues Affecting the Hydrocarbon Sector&#13;
3 .    Issues of concem which were identified by the Environmental Diagnosis which was carried in&#13;
February 1993 are: (i) very weak capability of the Environmental Unit (Comision Ejecutiva de&#13;
Seguridad Industrial y Control Ambiental - CESICA) in YPFB and extremely limited resources to&#13;
carry out its duties; (ii) the pressure to discover and produce rapidly to meet liquid demand; (iii) weak&#13;
institutional capability to carry out environmental impact assessment (EIA) and audits; (iv) the gas&#13;
export contract with Brazil and impact of the gas pipeline; (v) awareness-building and acceptance of&#13;
the environmental dimension in operations; (vi) access to colonists created by seismic and exploratory&#13;
drilling programs; and (vii) the lack of clear regulatory capability and therefore authority at the central&#13;
govemment level. Minor issues affecting the sector are: (i) gas flaring (although economically very&#13;
costly); (ii) impact on indigenous people and protected areas; (iii) above-ground pipelines and risk of&#13;
oil spill contamination, (iv) non availability of materials and appropriate equipment to deal with&#13;
environmental problems; (v) oil spills in general; and (vi) lead in gasoline.&#13;
4.    In general, the environmental performance of YPFB requires improvements in the areas of&#13;
communication with other agencies, and in the performance of exploration, production and storage,&#13;
refining and processing, transportation (gathering and distribution), and commercialization.&#13;
5.    Existing Legislation, Regulations, Norms and Standards. Key aspects of legislation are the&#13;
Environmental Law (Ley de Medio Ambiente) of 1992, and the Hydrocarbons Law of 1990 (Ley de&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Hidrocarburos). The latter is being revised with assistance from the proposed Credit. The&#13;
Environmental Law is considered a strong, well-developed law upon which environmental regulations,&#13;
standards, and norms can be drafted and promulgated. Both laws give the authority to the Secretariat&#13;
of Environment (Secretaria Nacional de Medio Ambiente --SENMA), which was changed to the&#13;
Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment (MOSDE), to review and approve all&#13;
environmental impact assessments (EIA), and to the Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons which was&#13;
changed to National Secretariat of Energy (NSE) to develop environmental regulations, norms and&#13;
standards for the hydrocarbon sector.&#13;
6.    Already a preliminary draft set of regulations to be promulgated as well as draft operational&#13;
guidelines for the exploration, perforation, production, transport, industrialization, and&#13;
conmmercialization of the sector, were developed at a seminar which included the participation of&#13;
MOSDE (Calidad Ambiental), YPFB (CESICA) and the private petroleum industry (Diamond&#13;
Shamrock, Tesoro, Perez-Compac, Chevron, Mobil, Texaco, Phillips, Maxus, and Petro-Canada).&#13;
This work was incorporated in a document entitled "Environmental Regulations for the Petroleum&#13;
Industry".&#13;
7.    Environmental Impact Assessment. MOSDE is now finalizing Bolivia's first EIA&#13;
regulations. In the future, most of the activities and particularly major project will have an EIA. The&#13;
credit will provide the necessary technical and financial resources to assist the future Environmental&#13;
Unit to ensure that these EIA are carried out and presented to NSE as well as to MOSDE for review,&#13;
recommnendations and final approval.&#13;
8.    Indigenous People. The Government is aware and concerned about the potential impact that&#13;
inadequately addressing environmental problems associated with petroleum operations will have on&#13;
indigenous people( as well as ecology), and on attracting further private investments in exploration.&#13;
While draft regulations and operational guidelines have been developed with the help of consultants&#13;
under a previous IDA project, there is a risk that these may be difficult to implement given the scarcity&#13;
of resources of the implementing agency. Therefore the project will address these issues and will&#13;
provide training and consultant support to the Environmental Unit that will be established in NSE as&#13;
part of this credit.&#13;
Environment Audit and YPFB Capitalization&#13;
9.    Clarifying environmental responsibilities and liabilities in the restructuring process helps to&#13;
improve investment decisions and the long-term viability of the investments, and to minimize future&#13;
health and economic risks from poor environmental management practices. The environmental audit&#13;
will take into account the ecological and social issues such as social impacts from road construction,&#13;
seismic and drilling operations and interaction of work crews with the local and indigenous community&#13;
who are vulnerable to the loss of traditional livelihoods. CAPU (in conjunction with NSE and YPFB),&#13;
has commissioned two comprehensive environmental audits of all YPFB facilities and operations,&#13;
especially those that will be included as part of the capitalization for private participation. These audits&#13;
are carried out by two outside consultants and are funded by the CIDA and US Trade Development&#13;
Agency, respectively. They will cover environmental problems from (i) past operating practices; (ii)&#13;
current operating practices; and (iii) design-related issues. A Legal counsel firm will review these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
audits to determine legal obligations of each party concerned with regard to rnitigation measures and&#13;
plan which will be recommended by the audit (see para. 10 of this attachment). The Audit reports will&#13;
provide a baseline from which investors and lenders can make an improved judgment conceming risk&#13;
and appropriate mitigation. It will also help in preparing documents for bids and contracts, and can&#13;
also provide some general information on the process of developing better environmental practices in&#13;
the hydrocarbon sector. The environmental audit will include:&#13;
(a)    Assessing the scope of existing environmental problems from past operations and&#13;
identifying the remedial measures to be taken.&#13;
(b)    Detennining how and when these remedial measures are to be taken and assigning the&#13;
responsibility for these measures.&#13;
(c)   In the case of refineries and wells that will continue in production, upgrading&#13;
environmental management and defining clear operational guidelines and procedures.&#13;
(d)   In the case of assets that will be permanently closed and abandoned (including&#13;
exploration and development wells), applying clear procedures to prevent potential&#13;
future contamination.&#13;
(e)    Defining appropriate guidelines and/or legal obligations if there are no specific national&#13;
legal requirements that address the above issues.&#13;
Laboratory and Monitoring Capacities&#13;
10.   Increasing laboratory and monitoring capabilities is fundamental to improving the technical,&#13;
scientific, and legal aspects of environmental management in Bolivia. The market for these services&#13;
will gradually increase as environmental management grows, particularly if govemment institutions&#13;
generally rely on private services. Making the needed improvements will require strengthening both&#13;
technical and human resources. This credit will not finance purchase of laboratory equipment nor the&#13;
establishment of an environmental laboratory. However, laboratory services will be contracted out to&#13;
existing private laboratories. In addition, IDA is preparing an Environment, Industry and Mining&#13;
Project which has, inter-alia, two relevant components for the project: laboratory upgrading and&#13;
remediation fund. One of the objectives of this new project is to provide assistance in the remediation&#13;
of pollution stocks in the mining and the hydrocarbon sectors. The laboratory upgrading would help&#13;
improve quality of laboratory testing and calibrating in Bolivia. Hence, services from these laboratories&#13;
will be available to the environmental unit in NSE. This environmental unit will be working in close&#13;
coordination and cooperation with the Environmental Quality Control Unit of NSONRE which will be&#13;
providing guidance to the unit. Furthermore, the environmental unit will procure two 4WD jeeps with&#13;
funds from the credit to have the mobility to patrol E&amp;P sites and operations and to take and test&#13;
samples of effluent discharge from oil and gas plants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Description of the Objectives of the Environmental Action Plan&#13;
11.   Perhaps the most critical element to successful environmental protection is inter-ministerial&#13;
collaboration and coordination. The President of YPFB, with the signatures of two Vice Presidents,&#13;
should announce a corporate commitment to environmental management on the part of YPFB, as an&#13;
integral part of operations.&#13;
12.   The project will not provide technical assistance to strengthen CESICA because it was&#13;
considered that: (i) it will not be efficient to do so just prior to capitalization; (ii) the new strategic&#13;
investors that will take over will know better how to reorganize the NMLEC in order to address all&#13;
aspects related to environment. However, in order to improve in the short term, the environmental&#13;
capability of YPFB, the following is recommended:&#13;
*  The environmental responsibility should remain in one division of the company, with&#13;
procedural links requiring its involvement in the operations of the other divisions. CESICA&#13;
should maintain technically competent leadership, and human and equipment resources&#13;
should be expanded.&#13;
-  A written corporate environmental policy should be developed at YPFB as soon as&#13;
possible. A program of awareness-building be prepared and implemented. This should be&#13;
followed by a program of policy and procedures development which senior executives&#13;
would help to formulate. YPFB should require the attendance of CESICA at all corporate&#13;
policy meetings, and that CESICA be represented at all initial meetings for project planning&#13;
and financing.&#13;
*  YPFB should initiate an institutional development plan for CESICA covering the next 3&#13;
years.&#13;
*  Expand and adopt the draft set of regulations and operational guidelines that were&#13;
developed at a seminar referred to above in para. 6.&#13;
*  CESICA, in conjunction with the NSE should have the mandate and resources to address&#13;
the environmental ramifications of the gas export contract to Brazil.&#13;
*  A detailed environmental training plan should be developed for NSE.&#13;
13.   Relative to national environmental objectives, the following is recommended:&#13;
* The environmental standards adopted by the hydrocarbon industry in Bolivia should be&#13;
those recognized internationally with a phased expectancy for meeting them over a period&#13;
that should be agreed upon among the NSE, the NSONRE and the petroleum industry. At&#13;
the end of this period, the industry should be fully operational at international standards,&#13;
with concomitant obligations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
*  The environmental sub-component should assist the NSE to develop an Environmental&#13;
Unit in a form of a small end efficient entity, and strengthen NSE capability to develop&#13;
policy, prepare guidelines and regulations, review applications. This unit should be&#13;
managed by a Technical Director who would be supported by a chemical engineer, an&#13;
environmental engineer, an ecologist, a social scientist, and an environmental lawyer. The&#13;
project will initially provide long term consultants in these areas to establish the unit and&#13;
provide on the job training to its staff&#13;
*  At least four long term consultants should be provided to the Environment Unit to develop&#13;
hydrocarbon norms and standards in close collaboration with the NSONRE of the&#13;
MOSDE and to launch the unit activities.&#13;
*  The MOSDE should be the institution in charge of enforcing all environmental regulations,&#13;
norms and standards and should work in close cooperation and coordination with the NSE&#13;
to achieve this goal.&#13;
Relations between NSE and MOSDE&#13;
14.   The MOSDE approach to environmental matters is based on a decentralization principle which&#13;
will give the authority to each productive sector of the economy to take the lead in establishing the&#13;
specific legal and regulatory framework as specified by the sector laws and the Environmental Law as&#13;
well as the institutions they need to monitor environmental aspects specific to their respective sector.&#13;
Based on this approach, MOSDE will not interfere but will be enforcing environmental laws and&#13;
regulations, and providing assistance through the laboratories it has already established and the&#13;
technical services which are under its jurisdiction. Consequently, MOSDE indicated that it is the NSE&#13;
responsibility to establish an environmental unit which will be in charge of monitoring all environmental&#13;
aspects of all activities in the hydrocarbon sector as well as in the power sector. However, it will be its&#13;
responsibility to enforce environmental regulations, norms and standards. Within that framework, there&#13;
vill be a permanent consultation and coordination between its own departments and those of NSE, as&#13;
reflected in the draft Development Credit Agreement under Article III, section 3.01 (c). More&#13;
specifically, the Government will: (i) ensure that, from time to time and as needed, environmental&#13;
regulations are developed, (ii) establish mechanisms for reviewing environmental audits for existing&#13;
facilities of, and operations by YPFB and other oil companies currently operating in Bolivia and in the&#13;
fui.ture, for carrving environmental impact assessments for all new or rehabilitated facilities; (iii) ensure&#13;
that coordination between all Government agencies involved with environmental matters for the sector;&#13;
(iv) ensure that the various responsibilities for monitoring environmental aspects of the sector are&#13;
clearly delineated for the various agencies involved; and (v) maintain and consolidate the group of&#13;
personnel, which wNill become the nucleus for the environmental unit that will be established in NSE.&#13;
Finally, MOSDE indicated that it will maintain an open dialogue and close collaboration with the oil&#13;
companies and use their expertise and experience in other countries in order to draft satisfactory&#13;
environmental regulations and operating guidelines, and establish good and healthy working relations&#13;
with the industry., and (vi) enforcing environmental regulations, norms and standards.&#13;

            the reform of, and future development in the sector. The
            second component, capitalization of YPFB, including
            pre-capitalization analytical studies and preliminary
            activities and preparation for the capitalization
            transaction of Mixed Economy Coporations (MECs).
