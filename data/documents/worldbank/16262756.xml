&amp;#12;Living without Sanitary Sewers in Latin America      Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Progress toward fulfillment of the MDGs indicates that the target of access to safe drinking water will be met. However, in many Latin American countries, even though&#13;
access to improved sanitation is recognized as a key component in the integrated protection of health, this target is increasingly out of reach.&#13;

The present report addresses three essential aspects of on-site                        and industries which has attracted workers from the&#13;
sanitation service management in periurban areas: fecal sludge                         countryside in search of better remuneration. On the&#13;
removal, collection, and disposal.                                                     other hand, their character is being shaped by the&#13;
                                                                                       interdependence between the people arriving from small&#13;
1.1 Peri-urban Areas                                                                   cities and rural areas and those who already live in the&#13;
There are a number of definitions of peri-urban area, but they                         large metropolises, giving rise to the creation of new&#13;
share at least two characteristics in common: first, these areas                       identities.&#13;
are located on the periphery of cities, and second, they function&#13;
as a transition between urban and rural areas. However, the                            These two processes have turned peri-urban areas into a&#13;
concept is considerably more complex than that.                                        heterogeneous environment that now has a mix of both&#13;

In the early 1990s, peri-urban was synonymous with informal                            low-income populations.&#13;
or even illegal settlements, explosive growth, and population&#13;
density, as seen in the following passage:                                             According to UN-Habitat (2005), 419 million people&#13;
                                                                                       in Latin America and the Caribbean (79 percent of the&#13;
      Third World cities are divided into two distinct sectors:                        regionâ&#128;&#153;s total population) live in urban areas. Of these, 29&#13;
      formal and informal, or urban and peri-urban.                                    percent are considered poor or indigent. Figure 1.1 shows&#13;
      Peri-urban and informal sector settlements are also                              that in Latin America nearly twice as many poor people&#13;

     Despite the availability of technically and eco-friendly&#13;
     options,3 two major drawbacks stand in the way of their mass&#13;
     adoption: their price, and the fact that the people building&#13;
     them are not qualified to install them. The latter situation&#13;
     can lead to a number of problems, including the following:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 The septic tanks can end up storing water and fecal solids&#13;
        together. If the septic tank does not have at least two&#13;
        chambers, one larger than the other, the fecal sludge is&#13;
        not separated out, and therefore it cannot be extracted&#13;
        later (Tilley et al. 2008).&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 The residual water can remain in the septic tank instead&#13;
        of being discharged to absorption wells and/or filtration&#13;
        beds.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 The holes in the well filter can become clogged with&#13;
        grease, preventing filtration of the residual water. As a&#13;
        result, the wells overflow and households are faced with&#13;
        the unanticipated cost of cleaning out both the chamber&#13;
        and the absorption well.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 The size of septic tanks tends correlate with the finan-&#13;
        cial capacity of households. Small tanks fill up more&#13;
        frequently and require a greater investment in mainte-&#13;
        nance. Large tanks, on the other hand, can collapse if&#13;
        their structure is weak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     3	 Namely,	septic	chambers	or	tanks	(which	allow	the	effluent	to	be	absorbed	through	filtration	wells)	and,	although	they	are	more	expensive,	prefabricated	tanks.&#13;

Collection of fecal sludge is essential both for conventional                    Based on the surveys administered to users of fecal sludge&#13;
on-site sanitation systems (pit latrines and the like) and for                   collection services and information gathered from the compa-&#13;
ecological systems (dry latrines and dry bathrooms). Even                        nies working in this area, it was confirmed that the quality of&#13;

The present study focuses on peri-urban areas because this&#13;

m3/month) is taken to the SAGUAPAC stabilization ponds.                                   In this case, the treatment consists of the following steps:&#13;
There it goes through anaerobic and facultative treatment                                 thickening, digestion, pressing, and drying in sheds. Once&#13;
and, finally, maturation.                                                                 it is dried, it can be used in agriculture.&#13;

     23 In Tegucigalpa, the tariff for sewerage system services is 25 percent of the tariff for drinking water. Studies of tariffs in several countries indicate that the real price for sewe-&#13;

     The greatest challenge for public policy makers, government                              The question then becomes: How can all of this be applied&#13;
     authorities, and public administration in general is figuring                            in peri-urban areas?&#13;
     out how to make these guidelines a reality.&#13;
                                                                                              The approach is to apply several sanitation technologies in a&#13;
     Sanitation 21 has proposed an integral approach that&#13;
                         28&#13;

     consists of analyzing sanitation systems ranging from the                                solutions might be implemented:&#13;
     individual dwelling to the barrio, city, or municipality. Each                              â&#128;¢	 One	 sanitation	 system	 for	 high-density	 peri-urban	&#13;
     of these levels is identified as a specific domain, and for each                                barrios (shantytowns);&#13;
     of them the following criteria should be analyzed:                                          â&#128;¢	 Another	sanitation	system	for	peri-urban	areas	with	&#13;

            focus on how external factors (poverty levels, land                                      finally&#13;

         â&#128;¢	 Potential for sanitation technologies: measures to&#13;
            ensure that solutions at the household, for example,                              This approach has been used successfully in Indonesia (Par-&#13;

            such as the barrio, city, or municipality. It is impor-                           the benefit of long-term on-site sanitation systems. In order&#13;
            tant to consider whether the solutions being analyzed                             for it to work, however, social and political acceptance is&#13;
            involve a single technical option (sewerage systems,                              crucial, and the approach must also be economically feasible.&#13;
            for example) or whether it is possible to analyze and                             Moreover, the solutions must take health promotion into&#13;
            combine on-site sanitation or decentralized options.                              account and be eco-friendly.&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Fit for the intended purpose: for example, analysis&#13;

            Living without sanitary sewers in Latin
            America : the business of collecting fecal sludge in four
            Latin American cities
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The present report spotlights the major
            challenges and the opportunities that lie ahead in fecal
            sludge management and summarizes the findings from four case
            studies that describe the current and potential market for
            sludge removal, collection, and disposal in peri-urban
            areas. These areas, inhabited by a variety of ethnic,
            religious, and cultural groups, typically struggle with high
            population density, insufficient land use planning, high
            citizen insecurity, and low coverage with basic services.
            The report demonstrates how technical, financial,
            environmental, social, regulatory, political, and
            institutional factors interact to create supply and demand
            in four markets where coverage with sanitary sewerage
            services is below the regional average, namely: Santa Cruz
            (Bolivia), Guatemala City (Guatemala), Tegucigalpa
            (Honduras), and Managua (Nicaragua).
