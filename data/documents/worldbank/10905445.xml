&#13;
The 1997 conference of the Mediterranean Development Forum, which comprises the World Bank and a&#13;
number of partner institutions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), was held in Marrakech,&#13;
Morocco, during the period May 12-17, 1997. The conference had a number of objectives, including the&#13;
sharing of 'best practice' approaches to development in the region, and the creation of a dialogue involving&#13;
senior government officials, the development community and the private sector within the region. The&#13;
conference consisted of 12 core workshops and a large number of other events on a broad range of&#13;
specialized topics, such as financial market development, water management, education reform, economic&#13;
journalism and telecommunications. The conference was attended by over 650 participants. The evaluation&#13;
of the conference, which was conducted by the EDI Evaluation Unit, focused on a number of key issues:&#13;
whether conference participants had learned new information and best practices which they could use in&#13;
their work; the extent to which regional networks had been fostered by the conference; the lessons which&#13;
could be learned from the wide diversity of approaches followed in the 12 workshops; and other lessons&#13;
concerning the organization of regional conferences. A number of data sources were used in undertaking&#13;
the evaluation: an earlier review of organizational/administrative lessons learned at the conference;&#13;
questionnaires completed by participants at the start and end of the workshops which they attended, and at&#13;
the end of the conference; individual action plans; interviews of the task managers of individual workshops;&#13;
back-to-office reports prepared by task managers; intervi ews of support staff; and examination of a quantity&#13;
of available published material and websites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ·    The conference was successful in attracting a large number of participants from the region, many&#13;
          of them government Ministers and senior civil servants. Participants reported that they valued the&#13;
          opportunity which the conference provided to establish and renew network contacts throughout the&#13;
          region, including the exchange of information and the sharing of experience.&#13;
&#13;
     ·    There was a high level of participant satisfaction with various aspects of the conference, and&#13;
          participants judged it to have been generally successful as a means of learning more about best&#13;
          practices and their application. Satisfaction levels were lower for the conference as a whole than&#13;
          for the workshops which formed its core, however. A key reason for this was the heavy agenda&#13;
          from scheduling numerous whole-of-conference activities, and the consequent fatigue experienced&#13;
          by many participants: the ambitious agenda included the workshops, plenary sessions, open space&#13;
          activities, master lectures and panel discussions. Some participants had workshop and conference&#13;
          events scheduled from 8am to as late as 8pm on a number of days. A result was that participants&#13;
          were tired, and had little time or energy to network with others outside their own workshop.&#13;
&#13;
     ·    Participant reactions, as well as observations from the task managers, indicate that the conference&#13;
          was successful in achieving depth of coverage of a broad range of specialized topics via the&#13;
          workshops. However, because the workshops covered a disparate range of topics and were&#13;
          organized largely as stand-alone events, they did not achieve much in the way of synergies&#13;
          between different subject matter areas. Future regional conferences would benefit from a clear and&#13;
          shared articulation of their objectives, and of the unavoidable trade-offs to be made between depth&#13;
          and breadth of coverage of conference themes and topics.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
· Participants also valued the opportunity to hear expert speakers from developed countries -- this&#13;
  can be a useful means of understanding good or best practices -- but also reaffirmed the message&#13;
  that they place a high value on having a number of regional speakers at workshops. This helps to&#13;
  ensure that the issues raised are topical, are dealt with in a credible manner, and are directly&#13;
  relevant to the region.&#13;
&#13;
· Some workshop task managers took the lead in setting up networks and other vehicles for regional&#13;
  collaboration, such as websites; but other task managers expressed the view that this was outside&#13;
  the scope of their core work. There are opportunities for EDI task managers to become more&#13;
  involved in developing and participating in regional networks, and this could be seen as entirely&#13;
  consistent with the role of an organization such as the World Bank. However, this would entail time&#13;
  and resource costs, and would need to be explicitly considered by EDI management. A number of&#13;
  the task managers at Marrakech devoted some time in their workshops to exploring such options&#13;
  with participants.&#13;
&#13;
· There were widely differing levels of participant satisfaction with different workshops. In response&#13;
  to a question on the relevance of the workshop to the participant's job, for example, the average&#13;
  score for workshops (on 6-point scale from 1= minimum to 6= maximum) ranged from a high of 5.4&#13;
  to a low of 4.3. There are many influences on such scores, a number of which are outside the&#13;
  control of task managers. But the diversity of approaches to planning, content and delivery which&#13;
  were followed in different workshops, plus the differences in participant reactions to different&#13;
  features of workshops, provide a rich source of understanding about what did or did not work well.&#13;
&#13;
· Some task managers achieved an understanding of the market and audience they were&#13;
  endeavoring to serve, via their close network links in the region; others achieved it by conducting a&#13;
  needs analysis. Several task managers suggested the desirability of allowing them to more tightly&#13;
  target participants, to ensure that only those with the greatest potential interest and contribution are&#13;
  invited.&#13;
&#13;
· It was evident from participant responses that some task managers had relied excessively on a&#13;
  lecture style, 'talking heads' format, and had crammed more and more speakers into whatever time&#13;
  was available. This appears to have taken place at the expense of discussion directly involving&#13;
  participants in activities such as question and answer sessions, case study assignments and&#13;
  presentations, and examination of regional implications. This problem also relates back to the issue&#13;
  of depth versus breadth in conference design, and the extent to which individual workshops should&#13;
  be designed as stand-alone events or as part of a wider conference.&#13;
&#13;
· The many successes of the Marrakech conference and the opportunities for further improvements&#13;
  in future regional conferences are encouraging. They reaffirm the importance of this type of activity&#13;
  as a vehicle for EDI to pursue, in helping client countries to build their capacity to learn and use&#13;
  knowledge, so that they can continue to build their skills and refine policies over time. Thus one&#13;
  option which merits consideration is that each of the six regional groupings within the Bank could&#13;
  consider organizing a major regional conference on a periodic basis. The average cost per&#13;
  participant in Marrakech was about $4100; it will also be important for EDI management to&#13;
  consider the relative cost-effectiveness -- especially the costs and learning effects -- of regional&#13;
  conferences vis-a-vis alternative learning/training activities, such as smaller conferences,&#13;
  workshops, ongoing networks, distance education approaches, and so on. Such comparisons will&#13;
  become easier as evaluation findings are progressively acquired for a range of other EDI activities.&#13;
