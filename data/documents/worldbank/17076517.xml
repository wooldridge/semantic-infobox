Bank. AFTWR is responsible for the administration as well as managing the MDTF including&#13;
fiduciary risks.&#13;
Governance, Administration and Execution. The governance structure is designed to ensure a&#13;
participatory and flexible approach. The governance arrangements will comprise two main&#13;
structures:&#13;
*     CIWA Advisory Committee.      At least one annual meeting with the Advisory&#13;
Committee will be held and if needed, a semi-annual meeting will also be considered.&#13;
The Advisory Committee's role will be to guide strategy, review program&#13;
implementation, and monitor results, periodic meetings of consultative groups targeted on&#13;
specific river-basins might also be considered. The committee will comprise all trust&#13;
fund donors who wish to participate and the World Bank. The World Bank will provide&#13;
an annual progress report as a basis for discussion, drawing out key issues, concerns, and&#13;
action points. Non-MDTF contributing partners may also be invited to meetings to&#13;
broaden dialogue and maintain an inclusive approach. The Committee will be both&#13;
consultative and advisory and will include: (i) provision of a forum for CIWA countries&#13;
and development partners to meet, exchange information, and consult on a regular basis&#13;
(e.g. at least one major meeting a year either in Sub-Saharan Africa or in a donor host&#13;
country); (ii) review and discuss progress reports and implementation of trust fund-&#13;
financed programs; and (iii) review of CIWA funding needs and promotion of the&#13;
participation of new donors to close funding gaps and support new program components.&#13;

fund. It will provide oversight and ensure that the use of its resources meet the objectives&#13;
of the CIWA program. The CIWA Advisory Committee meeting will advise on&#13;
appropriate action to promote the participation of new partners and additional funding to&#13;
close gaps and support new program components. Members of the CIWA Advisory&#13;
Committee will include a representative of the World Bank and a representative of each&#13;
partner contributing to the CIWA MDTF, such as multilateral and bilateral institutions,&#13;
non-governmental organizations and foundations, provided that they had signed an&#13;

Operations Analyst appointed by AFTWR. While the Trust Fund Core Team will consult&#13;
the Advisory Committee for strategic guidance and advice, the trust fund management&#13;
decisions will be the responsibility of a TTL of the MDTF, with oversight and guidance&#13;
