1. RURAL POVERTY IN BRAZIL, THE NORTHEAST AND PIAUI&#13;
The Rural Poor and the Economy&#13;
1.1   Poverty in Brazil has a strong rural and regional dimension. About 50 percent of&#13;
the Brazilian poor live in rural areas, and the incidence of poverty among the rural&#13;
population is more than double that in large cities and urban areas. Economic instability&#13;
over the past two decades was.a major obstacle to redressing rural poverty. The implicit&#13;
tax resulting from inflation penalized the poor disproportionately. Real economic growth&#13;
fell from 9% annually in the 1970s to 2.7% in the 1980s, and for more than a decade there&#13;
was little improvement in standards of living. Economic and sectoral policies did not&#13;
provide support for sustainable investment, and as a consequence savings fell, inflation&#13;
accelerated and consumer prices increased as much as 30% a month. Six separate&#13;
attempts at adjustment between 1986 and 1994 failed. Austerity programs associated with&#13;
the different adjustment attempts cut back investment for rural development, in particular&#13;
for primary education, targeted health interventions, rural roads, water supply and small&#13;
farmer agricultural services. Migration from rural areas in the 1980s and early 1990s--&#13;
motivated by unemployment, underemployment and lack of social and other services--&#13;
created an enormous new burden on urban centers, and underscored the urgency of&#13;
addressing rural poverty to stem its conversion into an urban poverty phenomenon.&#13;
1.2  Introduction of the Piano Real in July 1994 has achieved a substantial degree of&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization, with the annual inflation rate having been reduced to a&#13;
fraction of its former level. However, in the short to medium term, stabilization also&#13;
implies a very strong fiscal adjustment with tightening of government expenditures, high&#13;
real interest rates and, hence, a deepening of the investment pause in the farm and rural&#13;
sector. The consequences in terms of rural employment and lack of social services&#13;
continue to be serious, and clearly call for offsetting safety net actions. While successful&#13;
macroeconomic adjustment should promote longer-term economic growth with benefits&#13;
extending to rural areas, international experience shows that targeted programs and&#13;
policies for the socio-economic development of the poor remain an essential complement&#13;
to the adjustment process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Rural Poverty in the Northeast&#13;
1.3   The Northeast has long constituted the single largest area of rural poverty in Latin&#13;
America. This Region, covering nine states and part of a tenth, accounts for 19% of&#13;
Brazil's total land area and almost 30% of its 148 million population (1993). More than&#13;
half of all Brazilian poor, and almost two-thirds of the country's rural poor, live in the&#13;
Northeast where, according to a World Bank Poverty Assessment in Brazil, annual per&#13;
capita incomes of rural inhabitants reach only US$230 (less than one-tenth of the national&#13;
average).' Among the underlying causes of rural poverty in the Northeast are the&#13;
relatively poor resource base of large parts of the region and variable agro-climatic&#13;
conditions which make them vulnerable to drought. Skewed access to land and the virtual&#13;
absence of a functioning rural financial system for the poor are additional constraints.&#13;
Northeast agriculture is characterized by limited input use and slow rates of technology&#13;
adoption. Productivity is low, with output per farm worker less than half that of other&#13;
regions. Overall Northeast agricultural GDP growth was negligible during 1991-1994.&#13;
1.4    About 40% of the Northeast's rural population lives in the interior semi-arid zone&#13;
characterized by poor soils and severe, cyclical and often protracted drought. The&#13;
"drought polygon" in the semi-arid region includes most of Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte,&#13;
Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piaui and Bahia, and smaller proportions of all the other&#13;
Northeastern states except Maranhao. The remainder of the rural population lives in areas&#13;
which are generally more humid and have better soils, the coastal belt and the drought-&#13;
prone transitional zone between the coast and the semi-arid area. The rural economy&#13;
revolves around food crops including fruits and vegetables, and extensive irrigated&#13;
commercial export cropping and livestock grazing by larger farmers. As a consequence of&#13;
limitations imposed by uncertain climate and market fluctuations, the rural poor in the&#13;
Northeast, comprising small farm owners, tenants, sharecroppers and landless laborers rely&#13;
on a complex of activities including the subsistence cropping of basic foods and small-&#13;
scale animal husbandry, cash crops (mainly cotton and cashew), casual agricultural and&#13;
non-agricultural work, and remittances from family members living in cities.&#13;
1.5    Health and social indicators attest to the poor quality of life in the Northeast,&#13;
compared to the rest of Brazil. The region has: (a) a rate of chronic malnutrition of&#13;
children under five at 27% and, in the rural areas, 31 %, compared to 15% nationwide; (b)&#13;
57% of households without piped water supply, reaching 91% in the rural areas,&#13;
compared to 28% nationwide; (c) 30% of households without electricity, more than&#13;
doubling to 67% in the rural areas, compared to 13% nationwide; and (d) 73% of all&#13;
households and 96% of rural households lacking access to proper sanitation facilities,&#13;
compared to 46% nationwide.2&#13;

1.6   Public investment in the Northeast in basic infrastructure --particularly in&#13;
transport, electrification and water supply-- has declined dramatically in the past 25 years&#13;
because of economic recession and fiscal crisis3. The annual growth rate of public capital&#13;
investment in the region was 9.6% in the period 1970-80, 3.1% in 1980-90, but a minus&#13;
9.9% in 1990-93. The distribution of public investment between the Federal, State and&#13;
municipal governments, has also evolved significantly since the early 1980s. Comparing&#13;
the period 1970-80 to 1990-93, the contribution of the Federal Government to total&#13;
capital investment expenditure in the Northeast dropped from 58% to 47% while that of&#13;
municipal governments more than doubled from 9% to 19%. The State governments'&#13;
share remained practically constant at 33-34%. The proposed project would help&#13;
compensate for the lack of public investment expenditure in the Northeast. The project&#13;
would also reflect the shift in investment expenditure shares from the Federal Government&#13;
to municipal governments by concentrating resource allocation decisions for subproject&#13;
investments at the municipal level and by leveraging resources of municipal governments&#13;
to increase investment in poor rural areas.&#13;
1.7   The proposed project would also be a natural complement to important changes in&#13;
the political economy of Brazil that were brought about by the Constitution of 1988.&#13;
Fiscal resources, priority setting and program implementation responsibilities have been&#13;
increasingly decentralized from the Federal Government to the states, municipalities and&#13;
local populations. This encouraging trend should help avoid many of the financial and&#13;
managerial problems which generations of Northeast poverty programs encountered under&#13;
centralized coordination and implementation arrangements. Much of the Bank's dialogue&#13;
and lending for poverty, including in rural development, health and education, have now&#13;
shifted to the states, with the role of the Federal Government being redefined to stress&#13;
more strategic functions, such as broad policy and norm setting and financial transfer&#13;
schemes to improve equity.&#13;
Experience with Past Bank Lending&#13;
1.8   The Federal and State Governments have been involved since the early 1 970s in&#13;
financing projects to alleviate rural poverty in the Northeast. The World Bank has been&#13;
associated for many years with these efforts, through its financing of a series of programs&#13;
and projects, including area-specific and state rural development projects, various sectoral&#13;
operations and a regional rural development program.&#13;
1.9   Historically, rural development programs in the Northeast have coalesced around&#13;
two themes: drought relief and the integrated development of selected areas. The first&#13;
has involved emergency relief programs or projects to increase the productivity of scarce&#13;
water resources, including large public irrigation schemes. While the budgetary impact of&#13;
these projects has been tremendous, their poverty effects have been limited and often&#13;

temporary. The second approach, that of integrated subregional development programs,&#13;
has included initiatives like the Sertanejo Project and the Bank-financed&#13;
POLONORDESTE projects of the 1970s and early 1980s.&#13;
1.10 POLONORDESTE. The POLONORDESTE operations concentrated on&#13;
specific microregions within each of the nine Northeast states and the northern part of&#13;
Minas Gerais. They were comprehensive, multisectoral projects designed to improve&#13;
agricultural efficiency, raise rural incomes and increase employment. They typically&#13;
included components for agricultural modernization (extension, research, credit,&#13;
marketing, land administration), infrastructure (rural water supply, roads and irrigation)&#13;
and social investments (education, health and community development). Many important&#13;
sectoral initiatives were first piloted under the POLONORDESTE projects: farm&#13;
management extension techniques; integrated farm unit research for small-scale&#13;
agriculture, rather than crop-based research; a wide range of land redistribution initiatives&#13;
and modern land titling technologies; educational curriculum and school calendar reforms&#13;
for rural areas; and community-based primary health care schemes.&#13;
1.11  Nevertheless, evaluation of POLONORDESTE by the Bank in the early 1980s&#13;
showed that, in the aggregate, they had only a limited impact on poverty. The micro-&#13;
regions supported by the Bank projects were relatively small areas in the context of the&#13;
whole Northeast; poverty targeting mechanisms were weak; and delivery mechanisms&#13;
relied exclusively on Federal and state bureaucracies. The Federal Government frequently&#13;
failed to provide adequate counterpart funds and delayed the release of budgeted amounts,&#13;
with damaging effects on the projects given Brazil's chronically high inflation.&#13;
Consequently, less than one-third of project funds reached intended beneficiaries, as&#13;
seriously reduced budgets were absorbed by administration and overheads.&#13;
1.12  Sectoral Loans and the Northeast Rural Development Program. These&#13;
considerations prompted the Bank and Federal Government to change strategies in the&#13;
mid-1980s. On the one hand, the lessons learned from some of the pilot efforts under&#13;
POLONORDESTE were promising, but it was felt that these needed to be expanded&#13;
geographically and supported by broader sector policy reforms, within the framework of&#13;
single-sector operations unencumbered by the coordination and implementation difficulties&#13;
of multiple components. A series of sectoral operations, such as Northeast land titling,&#13;
education, health, and irrigation, resulted in the next few years.&#13;
1.13  With respect to integrated rural development, this was still considered to be a&#13;
viable and necessary approach but, again, it was felt that the effort should be expanded&#13;
statewide in order to have a broader impact, and that the number of components should be&#13;
drastically reduced. As a result, in 1985, the Northeast Rural Development Program&#13;
(NRDP) was established to alleviate rural poverty and improve the living standards of&#13;
small farm families in the Northeast. Under this program, the Bank approved during&#13;
1985-87 individual loans for the ten states in an amount totaling US$826.7 million. But,&#13;
through 1993, with the exception of one component supporting small community projects&#13;
(known as the APCR), implementation of the NRDP lagged behind schedule and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
performance in meeting basic objectives was weak. Some of the main causes were quite&#13;
similar to the causes of poor performance under the earlier POLONORDESTE projects:&#13;
chronic fiscal deficits and other macroeconomic distortions led to almost constant&#13;
counterpart funding shortages and widespread deterioration of many of the public&#13;
institutions responsible for carrying out the NRDP. The Federal Government devolved&#13;
some responsibilities to the states, but, by and large, institutional arrangements were still&#13;
highly centralized. Decision-making, administration and financing arrangements were&#13;
generally non-participatory, and the sense of project "ownership" at both state and local&#13;
levels was limited.&#13;
1.14 On the other hand, the innovative APCR community-based components (para.&#13;
1.13), which stressed community organization and relied on local planning and&#13;
implementation, were noticeably more successful. They acknowledged the expressed&#13;
needs of the communities, their poverty alleviation impact was positive, the cost per family&#13;
relatively low, and disbursement and commitment rates far exceeded those of other&#13;
components.&#13;
1.15 Reformulated NRDP. On the Bank's initiative, in 1993 the NRDP was&#13;
reformulated and transformed into a community-based development program, drawing&#13;
both on the successful experience of the APCR small community projects component and&#13;
on lessons learned with similar schemes elsewhere in Latin America. Performance has&#13;
since improved markedly. Rural communities are participating in the identification,&#13;
financing and implementation of subprojects that meet their most pressing needs, increase&#13;
their sense of project ownership, and have a much sharper focus on poverty alleviation.&#13;
The reformulated NRDP is covering all members of poor rural communities and not only&#13;
those with productive assets, extending beyond production and income, and based on a&#13;
"matching grant" mechanism linked to beneficiary contributions towards subproject cost.&#13;
The State Governments are fully responsible for counterpart funding, and the&#13;
corresponding sense of "ownership" of the program has also improved.&#13;
1.16  Based on implementation in the almost three years since reformulation, as well as&#13;
the earlier experience of the APCR components, certain facts are now clear. The program&#13;
has generated unprecedented enthusiasm among beneficiaries and favorable multiplier&#13;
effects--with replicability evident in other programs--and has mobilized additional funds&#13;
from municipalities and communities. As much as 93% of disbursements are reaching&#13;
targeted beneficiaries, and diversion of funds for non-intended uses has been sharply&#13;
reduced. The NRDP's participatory approach has induced greater community&#13;
organization and empowerment, increased transparency, and demonstrated that rural&#13;
communities can influence the allocation and use of resources at the municipal level to&#13;
alleviate poverty. Investments funded by the program have been of satisfactory quality&#13;
and less costly than those executed by public agencies. While the reformulated program&#13;
was not expected to change the basic agricultural economy in the Northeast, it has&#13;
successfully reached a large number of landless families and land reform beneficiaries.&#13;
Several field investigations, surveys and studies have assessed the impact of NRDP. The&#13;
consensus, from a broad sample of completed and operational subprojects, is that they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6-&#13;
have had a positive impact on the quality of life, and in the case of productive subprojects,&#13;
on employment and incomes of beneficiaries. In so doing, the NRDP has initiated a&#13;
process of local accumulation and, albeit still on a small scale, elevated the socio-&#13;
economic standards of beneficiary communities that will progressively allow them to enter&#13;
formal market channels. Additionally, the program, by providing essential infrastructure&#13;
and social services to these communities, has relieved some of the budgetary burden of the&#13;
northeast states and municipalities. A summary evaluation of the reformulated NRDP is&#13;
provided in Annex B.&#13;
The State of Piaui&#13;
1.17  The State of Piaui is the third largest state in the Northeast region of Brazil,&#13;
occupying 252,378 km2 in the western corner of the region, and is also, overall, its&#13;
poorest. The majority of the state area falls in the "drought polygon" and therefore suffers&#13;
from frequent drought and challenging agro-climatic conditions which, combined with a&#13;
skewed land distribution (para. 1.19), have exacerbated the difficult socio-economic&#13;
circumstances of the rural population of Piaui. The state's geographic profile varies&#13;
greatly from east to west and from interior to coastline. The southeastern part of the&#13;
state, which borders Ceara, Bahia and Pernambuco, is enveloped by the semi-arid region&#13;
and experiences average rainfall of only 600 mm per year. The western part of the state&#13;
consists of cerrado (savannah) vegetation and soils with average annual rainfall varying&#13;
between 800 and 1400 mm. From east to west, various transition zones exist between the&#13;
semi-arid and cerrado regions. Along the small coastline and down the Parnaiba river&#13;
valley in the upper northwestern portion of the state, average annual rainfalls reach 1600&#13;
mm, corresponding to a pocket of rainforest.&#13;
1.18  Piaui has long been regarded as one of the poorest states in Brazil, and this claim is&#13;
borne out in socio-economnic indicators. The population of Piaui stands at 2.6 million&#13;
(1991) of which 47% reside in rural areas. As evidence of the destitute conditions in&#13;
which the vast majority of the Piauense population lives, in 90% of Piaui's municipalities,&#13;
6 out of every 10 families are considered indigent, according to IPEA's Mapa da Fome4.&#13;
According to a joint study done by UNICEF and IBGE, 80% of the municipalities harbor&#13;
very precarious living conditions which put early childhood survival at risk. Many of these&#13;
unhealthy conditions stem from a lack of adequate infrastructure: 97% of rural&#13;
households have only precarious access to water, compared with 40% in urban areas; and&#13;
93% of rural households have no sanitary facilities, compared with 29% in urban areas.&#13;
Many poor families, particularly in rural areas, lack the basic education or income-&#13;
generating activities necessary to pull themselves out of poverty: according to an&#13;
ARIDAS study (1991), for every school-aged child in the rural areas, 3.73 children are not&#13;
attending school, while in the urban areas this relation drops to 0.8; 60% of the rural&#13;
population over 15 years of age is illiterate, compared with 27% of the urban population&#13;
4  Indigence is defined as the level of income that corresponds, at the maximum, to the value of a "basic food&#13;
basket" that meets a family's minimum nutritional requirements, as defined by FAO/WHO. Source: Mapa da&#13;
Fome, IPEA, March 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(IBGE 1991); and 85% of rural heads of household earn less than one minimum wage&#13;
(currently estimated at US$112) per month, compared with 54% in urban areas (IBGE&#13;
1991).&#13;
1.19  The agricultural sector is the largest employer in the state, occupying about half of&#13;
the economically active population, yet generates less than a quarter of the state's GDP5.&#13;
The poor performance and productivity of the agricultural sector is principally owed to&#13;
three factors: concentration of land ownership; a low technological base; and harsh agro-&#13;
climatic conditions. Indicators on land tenure from the 1985 Agricultural Census describe&#13;
a semi-feudal agricultural system which explains much of Piaui's poverty: 72% of all&#13;
farms are under 10 ha and represent just over 3% of total acreage cultivated; however,&#13;
half of one percent of all farms are over 1000 ha and represent 40% of total acreage. In&#13;
addition, of these small farmers with properties under 10 ha, over 50% are renters or&#13;
sharecroppers and not landowners in their own right. This significant concentration of&#13;
land illustrates a small farmer sector geared toward subsistence and not commercial&#13;
agriculture. Subsistence farmers are characterized by their traditional, non-mechanized&#13;
production practices and, without access to credit, use of minimal inputs outside of labor.&#13;
Finally, persistent droughts and the uneven distribution of rainfall, particularly in the semi-&#13;
arid region of the state, make the agricultural sector vulnerable to erratic climatic&#13;
conditions and cause significant fluctuations in income for the majority small farm&#13;
population. Absence of stable income generating opportunities in rural areas, combined&#13;
with a lack of social and economic infrastructure, induced a rural exodus to the cities&#13;
during the eighties when the urban population grew by over 50%.&#13;
1.20 State Government Strategy to Alleviate Poverty. The State Government of&#13;
Piaui has expressed great concern with the pressing problems of rural-urban migration,&#13;
particularly in the capital city of Teresina, stemming from the impoverished situation in the&#13;
rural areas of the state. The State has oriented its social programs toward the crea.ion and&#13;
strengthening of employment- and income-generating opportunities, with particular&#13;
emphasis on agriculture and agro-industry which directly concerns the rural sector. The&#13;
NRDP is one of the State's most important initiatives in this respect, along with&#13;
Comunidade Solidiria and other smaller social programs. In 1995, the State Government&#13;
created the Deliberative Council for Housing and Sanitation with the mandate to develop&#13;
decentralized actions led by municipal governments to improve housing and sanitation for&#13;
the poorest populations. As part of its economic development program outlined in the&#13;
State Sustainable Development Strategy, the State Government has embarked on an&#13;
administrative reform program which envisions an adjustment in the size of the public&#13;
sector, its structure, functions, and financing, and consequently would initiate processes of&#13;
privatization and increased partnerships with the private sector. These reforms, in&#13;
addition to efforts to boost irrigated agriculture and encourage the decentralization and&#13;
municipalization of health and education, would help public sector initiatives and social&#13;
programs to operate more efficiently.&#13;

1.21 Experience with Previous Bank Rural Development Projects in Piaui. The&#13;
State of Piaui has undertaken two Bank-financed rural development projects since 1981&#13;
under POLONORDESTE (the Piaui Rural Development (Parnaiba Valley) Project under&#13;
Loan 2015-BR) and the NRDP(under Loan 2762-BR). The history of the State's&#13;
involvement with the program is generally consistent with that of other northeast states&#13;
(paras. 1.8 to 1.16). Similarly, the State's experience under the NRDP prior to&#13;
reformulation was broadly in line with the rest of the region.&#13;
1.22 The reformulated NRDP in Piaui has disbursed very well but experienced problems&#13;
with subproject quality (see Annex B for details). Following strong and detailed&#13;
recommendations from the Bank, outlined in an "emergency" plan, the State Government&#13;
adopted measures to address issues in subproject performance, which notably improved in&#13;
recent months. The Technical Unit (Unidade Tcnica do PAPP-Piaui) is also undergoing&#13;
a thorough restructuring (see Annex D). Counterpart funding availability in light of a&#13;
severe fiscal crisis remains a serious problem but the state is adopting administrative&#13;
reform measures to alleviate the impact of the crisis (para. 1.20).&#13;
1.23  The NRDP-Piaui project closed on June 30, 1996. Of the original NRDP loan of&#13;
US$78 million, signed on July 20, 1987, US$34 million had been disbursed at the time of&#13;
reformulation. Since then, another US$17.7 million were disbursed and another US$1.1&#13;
mnillion fully committed, which together with the cancellation of US$25 million in&#13;
December 1994, leaves an outstanding balance of only US$0.3 million. The rate of&#13;
disbursements improved markedly after the NRDP reformulation: prior to reformulation,&#13;
the NRDP-Piaui project disbursed an average of US$5.6 million annually and after&#13;
reformulation this rate jumped to US$7.5 million. By the Closing Date, beneficiary&#13;
communities had submitted some 3,945 proposals, of which 1,569 were financed. 68% of&#13;
the subprojects financed were for infrastructure investments, 20% were for productive&#13;
activities and 12% were for social investments, the second highest rate of social&#13;
subprojects implemented in the NRDP behind the State of Sergipe.&#13;
Main Lessons Learned from the Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP)&#13;
1.24  The World Bank has 20 years of experience in supporting rural development and&#13;
poverty alleviation in Northeast Brazil, starting with the POLONORDESTE Program&#13;
(1975-84), a variety of sectoral projects and more recently with the NRDP (1985 to the&#13;
present). The NRDP, following its reformulation in 1993, has focused entirely on client-&#13;
driven subproject investments implemented by the communities themselves, with&#13;
decentralized project management at the state and municipal levels and more transparent&#13;
decision-making and accountability for project performance. Implementation has provided&#13;
important lessons for the proposed project (see Annex B for further details):&#13;
(a)   Decentralization of fiscal and investment decision-making from Federal to&#13;
state and local governments ensures more efficient project administration.&#13;
Decentralization of resource allocation and investment decisions to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
municipalities and communities should be accompanied by a clearly defined&#13;
and well-disseminated system of incentives and penalties to discourage the&#13;
misuse of funds;&#13;
(b)   Poverty-targeting mechanisms should be simple, explicit and&#13;
monitorable; be based on objective criteria; foster transparency and&#13;
minimize political interference in project resource allocation; and ensure&#13;
that project resources do reach the poorest communities;&#13;
(c)   Participation in the financing of subprojects generates a sense of&#13;
ownership and a willingness to share responsibility for the future operation&#13;
and maintenance of project investments. Beneficiary participation in the&#13;
selection, execution, supervision and financing of project investments&#13;
ensures that investments respond to true, perceived needs, generates cost&#13;
savings and increases accountability at the local level; the organization of&#13;
poor communities heightens their awareness of available programs and&#13;
services, facilitates their participation and increases subproject cost-&#13;
effectiveness;&#13;
(d)   Sustainability of project investments has greater potential when the&#13;
municipalities and communities contribute to subproject financing in a cost-&#13;
sharing arrangement and when there is increased beneficiary participation.&#13;
For example, the participatory process introduced in the pilot Municipal&#13;
Council component (FUMAC) of the reformulated NRDP ensured better&#13;
selection and prioritization of subprojects by beneficiaries. Sustainability is&#13;
also promoted when communities themselves assume greater&#13;
responsibilities and continue to voice their demands in a concrete fashion to&#13;
influence public investment expenditure at the local level;&#13;
(e)    A widely disseminated and carefully designed publicity campaign is&#13;
essential to ensure transparency and proper knowledge of the program's&#13;
objectives and contents by all potential beneficiaries;&#13;
(f)    Technical assistance should be accessible to rural communities to enable&#13;
them to identify, prepare and implement their own subprojects, thereby&#13;
augmenting their capacity to compete for investment funds. Technical&#13;
assistance should also be targeted to weaker municipalities to improve their&#13;
planning, management and financial capacity; and, the quality of the Project&#13;
Coordinating Unit (PCU), whether it provides technical assistance directly&#13;
or through partner entities, is a critical factor in project success and may&#13;
entail the contracting of local and/or international organizations to&#13;
strengthen its institutional capacities;&#13;
(g)   Standardization of subproject documents, technical designs and unit&#13;
costs simplifies the subproject preparation and evaluation process,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
facilitates the procurement of goods and works, prevents overdesign and&#13;
improves the quality of subprojects, thereby encouraging greater&#13;
participation by poorer communities and reducing bottlenecks in the&#13;
subproject cycle;&#13;
(h)   Supervision, both during and after subproject implementation, is an&#13;
indispensable determinant of success and sustainability. It has to be&#13;
reinforced at all levels and involve local entities closest to the communities,&#13;
particularly Municipal Councils and NGOs; and&#13;
(i)    A user-friendly monitoring and evaluation system facilitates the&#13;
subproject evaluation process, provides feedback and necessary&#13;
information to improve targeting and efficiency, and is an essential&#13;
management and planning tool.&#13;
1.25  The design of the proposed Piaui Rural Poverty Alleviation Project has taken into&#13;
account these lessons, which are consistent in many respects with lessons learned&#13;
elsewhere in Latin America and other regions with similar community-based development&#13;
programs. The project will expand the FUMAC approach and initiate a pilot municipal&#13;
funds program (para. 2.7), to promote decentralization of decision-making and resource&#13;
allocation to municipal and community levels, to relieve the administrative logjam resulting&#13;
from state intervention in the minutiae of subprojects, and to further encourage municipal&#13;
cost-sharing of subprojects. The project will employ a poverty targeting methodology&#13;
based on a series of poverty-related criteria at the municipal, community and beneficiary&#13;
levels, and backed by a strong system of operational checks and balances to thwart&#13;
mistargeting and misappropriation of resources. As a condition of loan effectiveness, an&#13;
improved monitoring and evaluation system will be adopted to reinforce the targeting&#13;
mechanism and to strengthen the management of the subproject cycle (paras. 2.32-2.41).&#13;
Equally important, for simplicity and efficiency in subproject preparation, evaluation and&#13;
supervision, the Project Operational Manual will establish standard subproject designs,&#13;
technical and financial parameters, and cost indicators for the most frequently requested&#13;
subprojects. In addition, funds for technical assistance to rural communities and&#13;
municipalities will be facilitated, to actively promote the organization of the poorest areas&#13;
to enable their participation, foster community capacity and empowerment, and encourage&#13;
the active participation of NGOs and local grassroots organizations. Finally, the&#13;
additional resources (and a larger share of Bank financing) will be allocated specifically to&#13;
supervision by the PCU and local entities, that would not only secure the quality of project&#13;
investments but also ensure that implementation bottlenecks, if any, are quickly resolved&#13;
so as to allow smooth and successful operation of the subprojects.&#13;

2.   THE PROJECT&#13;
Origin and Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.1   The proposed project is based on the positive results of the reformulated Northeast&#13;
Rural Development Program (NRDP). Evaluation by the Brazilian Government, FAO/CP&#13;
and the World Bank has confirmed that the reformulated NRDP, itself the culmination of&#13;
two decades of experience, has succeeded in introducing an effective model for rural&#13;
poverty alleviation in the Northeast. This model has now been field-tested for about three&#13;
years, and the Northeast State Governments are developing projects which would expand&#13;
its coverage. The proposed project in Piaui would be one of the second group of follow-&#13;
on operations, succeeding the Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects for Bahia, Ceara and&#13;
Sergipe, which were approved by the Board on June 29, 1995.&#13;
2.2   The Brazilian administration is preoccupied with the level of poverty nationwide,&#13;
but particularly in the Northeast and its rural areas, and has declared the Northeast a&#13;
priority for public development programs. The cornerstone of the Federal Government's&#13;
effort to combat poverty and hunger in Brazil is the Comunidade Solidaria program&#13;
launched in early 1995, a broad framework for the coordination of rural and urban poverty&#13;
programs and projects, focusing on municipalities where poverty is most severe.&#13;
Implementation is decentralized, stressing community self-help and local empowerment,&#13;
and concentrating on four main themes: rural development, income and employment&#13;
generation, food and nutrition -- which has tended to receive most of the focus in the early&#13;
stages -- and urban services. The proposed Piaui Rural Poverty Alleviation Project is fully&#13;
consistent with this strategy, parts of which draw heavily on the Bank-supported NRDP&#13;
experience in Northeast Brazil (paras. 1. 12-1.16).&#13;
2.3   The project is also fully supportive of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) for Brazil, discussed by the Board on June 29, 1995, and updated in the CAS&#13;
Progress Report discussed by the Board on June 20, 1996. The CAS identifies poverty&#13;
reduction as the central objective of the Bank's assistance efforts in Brazil, and recognizes&#13;
that policy dialogue and lending should be directed to the states, given their fundamental&#13;
role in the provision of infrastructure and social services. The CAS recommends specific&#13;
anti-poverty policies, particularly through the expansion of ongoing efforts to decentralize&#13;
and shift expenditure and implementation responsibilities from the Federal Government to&#13;
the states, municipalities and local communities. The proposed project is an important&#13;
factor in meeting the Bank's main objective in Brazil. As the principal donor engaged in a&#13;
sustained, long-term partnership with the Brazilian Government to address rural poverty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
issues in the Northeast, the Bank is particularly well placed to support this next phase of&#13;
development initiatives for Piaui.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
2.4   The project would assist the State Government of Piaui to alleviate rural poverty&#13;
and its consequences by: (a) providing basic social and economic infrastructure, and&#13;
employment and income-generating opportunities for the rural poor; (b) decentralizing&#13;
resource allocation and decision-making to local levels by supporting community-based&#13;
municipal councils and beneficiary associations in investment planning and&#13;
implementation; (c) providing a safety net for the rural poor during a period of&#13;
macroeconomic reform and fiscal adjustment; and (d) leveraging resources mobilized at&#13;
the community and municipal levels. The project is expected to lay the groundwork for,&#13;
and consolidate, participatory institutions and processes at the municipal and community&#13;
levels. The project would ensure that funds reach the poorest municipalities and&#13;
communities, and would expand the successful strategy of decentralization and&#13;
participation tested under the reformulated NRDP.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
2.5   The proposed project would include three main components, as follows:&#13;
(a) Community Subprojects (US$35.4 million or 90% of total base cost), which would&#13;
support small-scale investments selected and subsequently operated and maintained by the&#13;
beneficiaries themselves; (b) Institutional Development (US$2.0 million or 5% of total&#13;
base cost), which would provide all implementing entities and communities with technical&#13;
assistance and training to increase their capacity and improve implementation of the&#13;
project; and (c) Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.0&#13;
million or 5% of total base cost), which would finance project coordination and activities&#13;
to provide feedback on project performance and impact.&#13;
A. Community Subprojects&#13;
2.6   The project would provide grants to rural community associations to finance small-&#13;
scale subprojects (up to US$50,000 each) identified by these groups as priority&#13;
investments that would improve community well-being. Subprojects would be of many&#13;
types, broadly classified as infrastructure (such as rural water supply, electrification, local&#13;
road improvements, and small bridges), social (e.g., day care centers, school or health post&#13;
rehabilitation) and productive subprojects (such as small-scale community agro-&#13;
processing, communal tractors and minor irrigation schemes). Subproject selection is&#13;
demand-driven and based on community preferences. However, based on experience&#13;
under the reformulated NRDP, the project would establish a negative list of subproject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
types ineligible for financing and, for productive subprojects in particular, additional and&#13;
rigorous eligibility criteria6. SubproJect proposals would observe standard documentation&#13;
and technical, economic, environmental and sustainability criteria established in a detailed&#13;
Project Operational Manual, : thich sets forth procedures and guidelines for&#13;
implementation. The Operational Manual, based on the manual already in use for the&#13;
reformulated NRDP project, will reflect the lessons learned during the past three years of&#13;
implementation. During appraisal, agreements were reached on the needed improvements&#13;
to the NRDP Operational Manual. During negotiations, the Bank reviewed a complete&#13;
revised draft of the Operational NManuai, and assurances were provided by the Borrower&#13;
that all project components and subprojects would be executed in accordance with the&#13;
Operational Manual (para 3. l (a)). Adoption of the Operational Manual would be a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.2 (a)).&#13;
2.7    The identification, preparation and implementation of all subprojects financed&#13;
under the project will be the responsibility of the beneficiary rural communities (see paras.&#13;
2.32 to 2.41 for a detailed description of the subproject cycle). Three different delivery&#13;
mechanisms will distinguish how the subprojects are approved and the respective financing&#13;
arranged:&#13;
(a)    State Community Schemes (PAC). PAC was the original subprojects&#13;
component of the reformulated NRDP. Under PAC, rural communities&#13;
submit their subproject investment proposals directly to the State Project&#13;
Coordinating Unit (PCU). The PCU screens, approves and releases funds&#13;
for subprojects, interacting directly with the beneficiary communities. It is&#13;
expected that up to US$9.6 million equivalent, or 25% of total base costs,&#13;
would be invested under this subcomponent over the four-year project&#13;
implementation period;&#13;
(b)    Municipal Community Schemes (FUMAC). FUMAC was tested and&#13;
proven successful under the reformulated NRDP. In FUMAC, decision-&#13;
making on subproject approval is delegated by the State to project&#13;
Municipal Counicils, composed of community members and representatives&#13;
of civil society and municipal authorities. The Municipal Councils&#13;
prioritize the dlemnanids presented by rural communities through local&#13;
consensus-building and approve subprojects, within an indicative annual&#13;
budget, for financing by the PCU. The selection process would be the&#13;
basis of targeting in the project since the communities themselves, through&#13;
their participation in the project Municipal Councils, determine where&#13;
6   Eligible productive subprojects wotuld be those which provide services which benefit a large number&#13;
of community members ;ind  .1hJii ;a .'c is charged for operation and maintenance. Productive&#13;
subprojects, as with infrastructure and social subprojects. must be property of the association as a&#13;
whole and not of select members. For each type of productive subproject, a set of operational&#13;
guidelines (regulamento de uso). developed by the PCU, would be provided to the association and&#13;
must be adopted. In addition, each subproject proposal must identify the source of technical&#13;
assistance for subproject implementation and subsequent operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
project resources can best be applied based on their first-hand knowledge&#13;
of local investment needs. It is expected that at least US$23.0 million&#13;
equivalent, or 58% of total base costs, would be invested under this&#13;
subcomponent-;&#13;
(c)   Pilot Municipal Community Funds (FUMAC-P). This new&#13;
subcomponent would be a pilot variant of FUMAC, in which selected&#13;
Municipal Councils would prioritize and approve subprojects submitted by&#13;
rural communities and then would finance them within the context of an&#13;
annual budget, which the State PCU would delegate to the Municipal&#13;
Councils to manage themselves. This annual budget envelope would be&#13;
allocated to the Municipal Councils according to a distribution formula,&#13;
based on clear and measurable criteria, such as rural population and&#13;
previous year's performance, for implementation of an Annual Operating&#13;
Plan (POA) prepared by each Municipal Council and approved by the&#13;
PCU. The Municipal Council would transfer funds to beneficiary&#13;
associations to finance approved community subprojects. It is expected&#13;
that at least US$2.8 million equivalent, or 7% of total base costs, would be&#13;
invested under this subcomponent.&#13;
2.8   Each subcomponent represents a greater degree of decentralization of decision-&#13;
making and resource allocation responsibilities. Moving from PAC to FUMAC to&#13;
FUMAC-P, the control over project investment planning becomes increasingly local and&#13;
rural communities gain greater voice through their representation on the Municipal&#13;
Council as well as through their participation in its decisions. This institutionalization of&#13;
the participatory process would protect it from political fluctuation, and would eventually&#13;
lead to stronger partnerships between communities and Municipal Councils and their&#13;
respective municipal governments in determining the use of public resources.&#13;
2.9   Given the overwhelmingly positive response to FUMAC under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP, it is expected that the need for the PAC subcomponent would diminish over the&#13;
course of project implementation, with the FUMAC and FUMAC-P subcomponents&#13;
gradually expanding. The continued existence of PAC would facilitate participation in the&#13;
project of those communities within municipalities which lack either the capacity or the&#13;
political will to adopt the FUMAC or FUMAC-P approach. When a municipality is well&#13;
organized and receptive to participatory decision-making processes, it enters FUMAC, a&#13;
Municipal Council is formed and resource allocation decisions are made at the local level.7&#13;
Once the Municipal Council demonstrates effectiveness in prioritization of demands and&#13;
subproject supervision and a capacity to manage resources, the municipality is promoted&#13;
from FUMAC to FUMAC-P, and henceforth the actual resources are administered at the&#13;
local level by the Municipal Council based on locally-determined investment planning.&#13;
7  Under the reformulated NRDP in Piaui, 13 FUMAC Municipal Councils were formed. These&#13;
Councils will continue as FUMAC Councils under the proposed project or may be upgraded to&#13;
FUMAC-P Councils.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Flexibility would be built into the project to reallocate funds among subcomponents to&#13;
accommodate the expansion of FUMAC and FUMAC-P.&#13;
2.10  In compliance with Brazilian law, beneficiaries must form legally-constituted civil&#13;
associations in order to be eligible to receive financing under the project. Disbursements&#13;
to the beneficiary associations would occur through agreements (convenios) with the PCU&#13;
and/or project Municipal Councils. During appraisal, understandings were reached on&#13;
draft model agreements between the PCU, Municipal Councils and community&#13;
associations for the implementation of community subprojects under the FUMAC,&#13;
FUMAC-P and PAC subcomponents. The final model agreements would form part of the&#13;
Project Operational Manual. Beneficiary associations would contribute to subproject&#13;
costs, either in cash, kind or labor, and would be responsible for the operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) of the investments. The minimum level of contributions expected&#13;
from the beneficiaries, municipalities and the State Government would be specified in a&#13;
cost-sharing matrix in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
B. Institutional Development&#13;
2.11  The Institutional Development component (US$2.0 million or 5% of base costs)&#13;
will finance appropriate technical assistance and training in order for each group&#13;
participating project implementation to acquire the capabilities needed to effectively carry&#13;
out its responsibilities (Annex D). One of the objectives of the project is to lay the&#13;
groundwork for, and consolidate, participatory institutions and processes at the municipal&#13;
and community levels through the community subproject approach, described above, in&#13;
which well-organized communities with sound, carefully prepared proposals are provided&#13;
with financial support for investments, and in which FUMAC Municipal Councils which&#13;
demonstrate effective decision-making capacity are promoted to FUMAC-P and rewarded&#13;
with their own investment budget.&#13;
2.12  To encourage this process and to accompany the decentralized implementation&#13;
framework of the project, technical assistance and training would be provided for the&#13;
beneficiary associations, Municipal Councils, and the PCU, as well as other participating&#13;
entities (Annex E). For example, to derive optimal benefits from subproject investments,&#13;
the beneficiary associations will need accessible support for community organization and&#13;
subproject preparation and execution, as well as for training in operation and maintenance&#13;
techniques. The project Municipal Councils will require assistance to orient their decision-&#13;
making on resource allocation among community investments and, in the FUMAC-P pilot&#13;
program, to create capacity for investment planning and financial administration. In&#13;
addition to providing or making available from other sources a wide range of technical and&#13;
managerial advice to the project Municipal Councils and beneficiarv associations, the PCU&#13;
will need training to enhance its own project coordination and supervision skills. Also,&#13;
because the fiscal situation of the State affects both project implementation and state&#13;
counterpart funding, technical assistance at the state level is needed to analyze issues&#13;
surrounding the reform of the State and to identify measures to improve the State's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
capacity to address the inherent causes of its fiscal deficit situation. The instruments for&#13;
achieving this capacity building would include a combination of workshops, technical&#13;
exchanges, on-site training, and more traditional technical assistance, drawing upon local&#13;
expertise within the state --local extensionists, technical consultants, universities, NGOs,&#13;
and other local service providers-- as well as national and international technical assistance&#13;
agencies. To this effect, the component would finance consultant services, training&#13;
materials and courses, seminars, workshops, and related operational costs.&#13;
2.13   The implementation of the institutional development component would be&#13;
decentralized, and the provision of and accountability for technical assistance and training&#13;
would occur increasingly at the local level. In particular, project Municipal Councils will&#13;
play a critical role in overseeing the capacity-building activities for community associations&#13;
in their jurisdictions. Municipal Councils, provided with model terms of reference&#13;
prepared by the PCU, would contract technical assistance based on programs agreed with&#13;
the PCU, which would then release funds for that purpose. Institutional development&#13;
activities can be broadly categorized into five areas: (a) mobilization assistance and&#13;
training for participating communities. Organized and contracted by the PCU and&#13;
Municipal Councils, assistance would be provided for the organization and strengthening&#13;
of community associations, identification of viable investments, subproject preparation,&#13;
and operation and maintenance of investments; (b) capacity-building programs for&#13;
Municipal Councils. Organized by the PCU, the programs would include intensive&#13;
training on the role of Municipal Councils, guidelines of the Operational Manual,&#13;
subproject evaluation and supervision and related topics such as environmental assessment&#13;
of subprojects for each Municipal Council under the project, as well as participatory&#13;
planning and financial management training for FUMAC-P Councils; (c) specialized skills&#13;
training for all participating entities. Based on needs, expert advice and "on-the-job&#13;
training" by local providers would be contracted by the PCU, Municipal Councils and&#13;
groups of community associations, in areas such as the use of standard designs,&#13;
monitoring techniques, and financial administration as well as technical support (e.g., for&#13;
groups of community associations on water use); (d) technical assistance for State reform.&#13;
The Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN), through the PCU, will have access to technical&#13;
assistance funds (US$0.5 million or 1% of base costs) for consultant services and studies&#13;
required for administrative and other state reforms. During appraisal, agreements were&#13;
reached with the State on the context and implementation arrangements for this technical&#13;
assistance subcomponent; and (e) workshops and seminars for the Municipal Councils and&#13;
beneficiary associations, to exchange experience under the project. These "best practice"&#13;
exchanges could also extend to seminars joining all PCUs of the ten Northeastern states to&#13;
disseminate successful experiences across states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
C. Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
2.14  This component (US$2.0 million, or 5% of total base costs) would support overall&#13;
project coordination and supervision and would help to strengthen the effectiveness and&#13;
quality of project operations. It would finance the incremental operating costs of the&#13;
PCU, for overall coordination of project activities, and a statewide information campaign&#13;
to disseminate information about the project and its guidelines to all potential beneficiary&#13;
communities, to increase awareness, transparency and participation. For this campaign,&#13;
the project would finance: (a) local technical assistance in the design and development of&#13;
the campaign, and (b) the implementation costs, including posters, leaflets, radio spots and&#13;
videos. The preparation of a statewide information campaign, acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.2 (b)).&#13;
2.15   Given the importance of supervision to the overall impact of the program, project&#13;
supervision (Annex J) will be intensified under the project and, accordingly, will be&#13;
allocated half of the component's resources (US$1.0 million, or about 3% of base costs).&#13;
Project supervision will provide the PCU with the necessary information on project&#13;
performance to make managerial decisions, such as the provision of technical assistance or&#13;
training, the correction of departures from project guidelines, and the promotion of project&#13;
municipalities from FUMAC to FUMAC-P. In line with the decentralized implementation&#13;
of the project, the responsibilities for project supervision at the state and local levels will&#13;
correspond to the PCU and the project Municipal Councils, respectively. Supervision&#13;
activities to be financed under the project include operational expenses for field visits and&#13;
subcontracted services from NGOs and other participating agencies.&#13;
2.16  This component would also finance the establishment of a monitoring system,&#13;
including the maintenance and use of a Management Information System (MIS). To&#13;
function as an efficient management tool, the project MIS (Annex H), originally designed&#13;
under the NRDP, would be improved and made more user-friendly and performance-&#13;
oriented. It would contain key technical, financial and socio-economic information on&#13;
subprojects, as well as cost and other physical indicators. MIS-generated project reports,&#13;
including monthly disbursement reports and semi-annual progress reports, would facilitate&#13;
subproject tracking and generate appropriate feedback on project performance. Project&#13;
performance and impact indicators would be regularly updated to take stock of project&#13;
implementation and included in the semi-annual progress reports. A Project&#13;
Implementation Plan and a matrix of Project Performance Indicators were finalized and&#13;
agreed at appraisal. In addition to financing operating costs for monitoring activities, the&#13;
project would finance experts in information technology and project management: (i) to&#13;
improve the MIS; and (ii) to collect and analyze data on cost indicators and physical&#13;
parameters from the most frequently approved types of subprojects, so as to calculate a&#13;
range of values for these indicators and to adjust subproject eligibility criteria accordingly.&#13;
These adjustments would then be incorporated into the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.17 Finally, the project would finance consultant services to develop and implement&#13;
studies to evaluate the impact of the subprojects and provide feedback to improve project&#13;
operations: (a) annual physical performance reviews, to assess the quality and&#13;
sustainability of common types of subprojects financed by the project, including reviews of&#13;
community-based procurement; (b) an implementation review, carried out at the mid-term&#13;
of implementation, which would include beneficiary consultations to generate an&#13;
evaluation of project performance and impact as perceived by the ultimate beneficiaries;&#13;
and (c) a comprehensive impact evaluation, which would include a baseline evaluation to&#13;
establish indicators of socio-economic impact, and a final evaluation of the project, at the&#13;
outset of the fourth year, using these indicators. Annex H contains a detailed description&#13;
of the studies to be financed under the project.&#13;
2.18 During negotiations, assurances were provided by the Borrower that: a project&#13;
information and monitoring system, with reports and format agreed with the Bank, would&#13;
be maintained throughout the project period. The Bank would receive monthly&#13;
information on disbursements of project funds and semi-annual reports on subproject&#13;
activities and performance of project investments on July 31 and January 31 of each year&#13;
(para. 3.1 (b)); a baseline impact evaluation study would be completed within one year of&#13;
loan effectiveness, and a mid-term review of project implementation would be carried out&#13;
at the end of the second year of the project, and a full impact evaluation would be&#13;
executed at project completion (para. 3.1 (b)). The establishment, by the State. of effective&#13;
project monitoring and evaluation arrangements would be a condition of loan effectiveness&#13;
(para. 3.2(c)).&#13;
Project Implementation Arrangements&#13;
2.19 Project Coordinating Unit. The Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN) of the State&#13;
of Piaui will be the agency responsible for the Project, and will assign project coordination&#13;
responsibility to the PCU --represented by UT-PAPP8, an entity under SEPLAN which has&#13;
been in charge of overseeing the implementation of the NRDP and its Bank-financed&#13;
predecessors since 1981. The PCU would be the focal point for project administration&#13;
and for communication with the Bank and the State Government. The PCU is the&#13;
project's principal liaison for the Municipal Councils and for those community associations&#13;
located in PAC municipalities. Under the proposed project, the PCU will shed some of&#13;
the executive responsibilities that it held under the reformulated NRDP, delegating these&#13;
to Municipal Councils and other participating entities at the local level, and will&#13;
concentrate on its monitoring, technical assistance and supervision responsibilities.&#13;
2.20 The former UT-PAPP has undergone a major restructuring to streamline its&#13;
organization and introduce greater flexibility, to better reflect its role of coordinating&#13;
project implementation and delegating responsibilities to the local level. Under the&#13;
General Coordinator, who will oversee all aspects of project implementation and who&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
reports to the Secretary of Planning, the PCU will be divided into three functional areas:&#13;
Planning and Evaluation; Operations, and Administration and Finance. With a total staff&#13;
of sixty, the PCU will assign greater field supervision and trouble-shooting tasks to&#13;
Municipal Councils or contract them out to NGOs and other organizations (see para.&#13;
2.15).&#13;
2.21  The PCU's principal tasks under the project will include: (i) project planning and&#13;
coordination at the state level through the preparation of POAs, including the&#13;
consolidation of POAs by FUMAC-P Councils, and monitoring activities through&#13;
maintenance of the project's Management Information System (MIS); (ii) promoting the&#13;
project and encouraging participation of potential beneficiary communities, NGOs and&#13;
private sector entities; (iii) preparing project implementation reports and organizing&#13;
evaluation exercises; (iv) ensuring timely and adequate provision of loan and state&#13;
counterpart funds; (v) appraising and approving all PAC subproject proposals; (vi)&#13;
entering into subproject agreements with community associations (PAC) and Municipal&#13;
Councils (FUMAC) and into POA-based agreements with FUMAC-P Municipal Councils,&#13;
to transfer subproject funds and monitor their use; (vii) overseeing all monitoring and&#13;
supervision activities under the project to ensure compliance with project guidelines and to&#13;
improve the quality of subprojects and project interventions; (viii) ensuring that&#13;
environmental guidelines for subproject approval and implementation are followed; (ix)&#13;
providing technical assistance to the FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils; (x)&#13;
preparing statements of expenditure (SOEs) and applications for reimbursement; and (xi)&#13;
ensuring that procurement, disbursement and auditing procedures applicable to the Bank&#13;
loan are followed.&#13;
2.22  Assurances were provided by the State of Piaui at negotiations that POAs and&#13;
budgets would be made available to the Bank for review and comments by October 31 of&#13;
each year; that the Bank would receive a copy of the final plan and budget as soon as they&#13;
are approved; and that adequate counterpart funding would be made available for the&#13;
project in a timely manner by the State (para. 3. 1(c)). Approval of targets for any given&#13;
year will be contingent upon performance in the previous year, including a thorough&#13;
analysis of the actual demand from communities, of subproject costs actually observed,&#13;
and of the number of uncompleted subprojects.&#13;
2.23  Project Municipal Councils. Municipal Councils are the key entity for the&#13;
targeting of project benefits and the allocation of resources under the proposed project.&#13;
By their nature as open and representative bodies which build consensus on priorities, the&#13;
project Municipal Councils instill transparency into the decision-making process for&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P investments. The Councils would comprise representatives&#13;
from: (a) rural communities, civil groups and organizations such as NGOs, religious&#13;
organizations and rural labor unions; and (b) publicly-elected representatives and&#13;
municipal government officials. While the composition of these Councils may vary from&#13;
one municipality to another, representatives from rural communities and civil society&#13;
would make up at least 80% of the Councils' membership. The PCU would participate in&#13;
the Councils in an advisory capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
2.24  The Councils would receive, prioritize and approve subproject proposals from the&#13;
beneficiary associations during regularly scheduled meetings which are widely publicized&#13;
and which the public is encouraged to attend. The Councils would deliberate and&#13;
prioritize the subproject proposals presented according to their determination of the needs&#13;
of the different communities, based on criteria such as the level of poverty and the existing&#13;
infrastructure of each community in relation to the rest of the municipality; the type of&#13;
subproject to be financed and its potential to improve the quality of life of the beneficiary&#13;
population; and the demonstrated participation of the beneficiary community in the&#13;
identification of the subproject and its commitment to the operation and maintenance of&#13;
the subproject. Decisions to approve subprojects would be made by majority of votes and&#13;
based on pre-established technical criteria and/or standard designs. Detailed criteria, rules&#13;
and procedures for the Municipal Councils' structure and operations are included in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.25  The Municipal Councils would be entrusted with the following responsibilities: (a)&#13;
promoting the project in their areas; (b) facilitating assistance to the communities for&#13;
organizational strengthening and subproject preparation and execution; (c) prioritizing,&#13;
through local consensus-building, community subproject proposals and reviewing them for&#13;
approval or rejection; and (d) monitoring and supervising the implementation of approved&#13;
subprojects. Under FUMAC, the Municipal Councils will present subprojects which they&#13;
have approved to the PCU for financing; under FUJMAC-P, the Councils will themselves&#13;
be responsible for managing the funds allocated to them and signing the subproject&#13;
agreements with the respective beneficiary associations (Annex F). Under FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P, the Municipal Councils foster partnerships among the community&#13;
associations, the municipal governments and the State Government to share the costs of&#13;
the subprojects and therefore leverage the loan funds to finance increased numbers of&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
2.26  Community Associations. Community associations are the foundation of project&#13;
implementation. These associations are responsible for formulating ideas for subprojects&#13;
and submitting these proposals to the Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-&#13;
P) or the PCU (under PAC) for approval. Once a subproject has been approved, the&#13;
community association enters into a legally binding agreement with the PCU and/or&#13;
Municipal Council through which the funds to implement the subproject are passed to the&#13;
association. The association is responsible for all procurement9 and record-keeping during&#13;
the implementation of the subproject, as was practiced successfully in the reformulated&#13;
NRDP. Beneficiary associations contribute to subproject costs, either in cash, kind or&#13;
labor, and are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the investments.&#13;
2.27 State Steering Committee (Conselho Gestor). A State Steering Committee&#13;
would be established, presided by SEPLAN and with representatives from the Secretariat&#13;
of Agriculture, the Attorney General, the Agricultural Workers Labor Union (Federadao&#13;
9  Beneficiary associations may request assistance from the PCU for procurement under subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura do Estado do Piaui - FETA G), the NGO community&#13;
and the PCU. Through its advisory role to the project, the Steering Committee would&#13;
provide greater transparency to high-level project decision-making and provide a forum&#13;
for public and private sector cooperation in project implementation. Liaising with the&#13;
PCU, the Steering Committee would approve the POAs of the project and of the&#13;
FUMAC-P Councils; approve PAC subprojects which the PCU has reviewed and&#13;
recommended; promote municipalities from PAC to FUMAC and from FUMAC into&#13;
FUMAC-P; and accompany and facilitate the overall implementation of the project (see&#13;
Annex D). The functions of the Steering Committee were finalized and agreed at&#13;
appraisal and included in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
Project Technical Assistance and Training Arrangements&#13;
2.28  Technical assistance and training to beneficiaries is an indispensable input to&#13;
successful and sustainable subproject investments. Technical assistance and training&#13;
would be provided to beneficiary communities via two mechanisms (see Annex E): (a) the&#13;
institutional development component (paras. 2.11-2.13); and (b) a percentage of&#13;
subproject costs targeted to technical assistance. The Institutional Development&#13;
component provides flexibility and is not tied to any particular subproject(s), so that&#13;
communities can receive assistance even prior to subproject preparation and after&#13;
subproject completion. The component also allows for savings because of economies of&#13;
scale at the local level, since assistance can be contracted for several communities at once&#13;
(e.g., retainer contracts for operating expenses of local extensionists). Finally, the&#13;
operation of the component is decentralized and encourages local-level accountability.&#13;
Municipal Councils will be responsible for applying resources from the component-toward&#13;
assistance to communities in their jurisdictions and all technical assistance and training&#13;
agents hired by the Municipal Councils (in FUMAC-P) or by the PCU and approved by&#13;
the Councils (in FUMAC) would be held accountable to the Councils for their&#13;
performance.&#13;
2.29  Complementary to the Institutional Development component, each community&#13;
association has the option of directing up to 8% of the cost of each subproject to hire&#13;
technical assistance and training support tailored to its particular subproject. A proposal&#13;
for the use of this percentage would be included in the subproject application. In addition,&#13;
because technical assistance should extend into the operation and maintenance period of&#13;
their subprojects, particularly for productive subprojects, community associations should&#13;
include technical assistance among the expenditures to be financed out of O&amp;M funds&#13;
maintained by each association. As part of their regular supervision efforts, the PCU and&#13;
the Municipal Councils would monitor the frequency and quality of technical assistance&#13;
and training provided to beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Targeting and Graduation&#13;
2.30  Beneficiary targeting would occur at three levels: (a) geographically by poverty&#13;
level and other characteristics of the municipality; (b) geographically within municipalities&#13;
to target rural settlements and communities; and (c) community-based selection of poor&#13;
beneficiaries and particularly vulnerable groups by the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
Targeting at the first and second levels defines the project area. The project area includes&#13;
217 municipalities, all municipalities except Teresina, the state capital. Project&#13;
beneficiaries, however, include only those rural communities located in settlements of less&#13;
than 7,500 people, resulting in a project target population of about 1.7 million people.&#13;
The target population therefore lives in small, more isolated rural areas with greater&#13;
representation of the rural poor. The third and principal level of targeting is community-&#13;
based. Increased decentralization of subproject selection through the expanded FUMAC&#13;
and FUMAC-P programs will further strengthen the project's capacity to reach the most&#13;
needy communities in the project area. The Municipal Councils' prioritization process is&#13;
the basis of targeting in the project since the communities themselves, through their&#13;
majority participation in the Councils, determine where project resources will best be&#13;
applied based on their first-hand knowledge of community socio-economic conditions and&#13;
local investment needs. The clear and transparent rules and procedures for the Councils'&#13;
functioning, are also important for targeting poor beneficiaries at the lowest level. The&#13;
effectiveness of the targeting methodology in directing project benefits to the poor would&#13;
be assessed through the project monitoring system and through annual performance&#13;
reviews and the implementation review at mid-term (Annex H). Details on targeting&#13;
mechanisms are included in Annex C. During appraisal, agreements were reached with the&#13;
State of Piaui on these targeting mechanisms; these understandings would be reflected in&#13;
the final Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.31   Graduation of Communities and Municipalities. The demand-driven&#13;
community development model presented in the proposed project is expected to increase&#13;
the income-generating capacity and standards of living in the beneficiary communities.&#13;
Because project resources will be targeted to the poorest rural communities, certain&#13;
communities with better socio-economic standing relative to others would gradually&#13;
receive fewer investment resources during the course of project implementation. These&#13;
communities, able to leverage a critical mass of subprojects and other benefits from this&#13;
and previous Bank-financed and other projects, would gain access to other sources of&#13;
financing and reach a point where a "safety net" is no longer necessary. In order to&#13;
formalize this process, the proposed project would introduce a community graduation&#13;
strategy whereby those communities with demonstrated capacity for sustainable asset-&#13;
accumulation (savings), adequate social and economic infrastructure and community&#13;
organization), would progressively be charged a higher cost-sharing percentage (para.&#13;
2.46) and then eventually cease to be eligible for project matching grants (see Annex C).&#13;
To make this determination, profiles of beneficiary communities would be developed and&#13;
would include information on benefits from the reformulated NRDP and other public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
programs, existing infrastructure and access to social services, indicators of income and&#13;
nutritional levels, and other indicators of community well-being. The information would&#13;
be collected from subproject proposals submitted by the communities, incorporated into&#13;
the MIS, and regularly updated through monitoring and supervision exercises (see Annex&#13;
H). The point at which a community would provide a higher counterpart contribution and&#13;
the subsequent "take-off' point, when it would graduate from the project, would be&#13;
estimated at the end of the second year of the project, based on a study comparing&#13;
community profiles and indicators from the baseline impact evaluation. Using this&#13;
analysis, the PCU (for PAC) and the Municipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P),&#13;
with the support of the PCU, would graduate those communities having reached the&#13;
"take-off' point. During appraisal, agreements were reached with the State of Piaui on a&#13;
community graduation strategy; these understandings would be reflected in the final&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;
Community Subproject Cycle&#13;
2.32  Mobilization. The critical juncture in the community subproject cycle is the initial&#13;
stage when communities mobilize existing associations or form new associations which&#13;
can then benefit from the project. At the outset of and throughout the project, a publicity&#13;
campaign, carefully programmed and targeted to participating communities by the PCU to&#13;
create a level playing field for access to project funds, would disseminate information&#13;
about the project and its procedures to stimulate demand from potential beneficiaries&#13;
across the state. Some communities already have significant levels of organization, either&#13;
traditionally or from previous development projects in the area, and are poised to benefit&#13;
immediately from the project. However, for those less organized communities, the&#13;
project, through the Institutional Development component, would actively extend&#13;
mobilization assistance through the services of NGOs or accredited state agents (e.g.,&#13;
EMATER extension agents) who know the communities well and can serve as catalysts&#13;
for organization. These NGOs or accredited agents would mobilize the communities and&#13;
provide them with technical assistance for identifying and prioritizing their needs and&#13;
demands, preparing subprojects and forming associations, in order that all communities in&#13;
the project area can participate in project benefits. Through the MIS and regular&#13;
supervision, the PCU and project Municipal Councils would monitor the ex-post&#13;
allocation of project benefits, which would then facilitate targeting of assistance to those&#13;
municipalities which had not yet received support.&#13;
2.33  Prioritization and Preparation. Beneficiaries submit proposals for subproject&#13;
investments based on priority needs of their communities. Standard documentation for&#13;
subproject proposals, developed by the PCU, would be distributed to the beneficiary&#13;
associations to facilitate the subproject preparation and screening process. To ensure the&#13;
quality of the investments financed and to provide guidance to the beneficiaries when&#13;
preparing subprojects, the Project Operational Manual would contain standardized&#13;
technical designs, including simple environmental guidelines and cost parameters (e.g.,&#13;
cost per physical unit or per beneficiary) for the most frequent types of investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Beneficiary associations may request technical assistance for more sophisticated or less&#13;
common subproject types.&#13;
2.34  Various standard designs already exist, and others would be developed under the&#13;
project (Annex G). In some cases, specialists would be contracted to prepare the designs,&#13;
based on terms of reference agreed with the Bank. In others, the PCU would gather and&#13;
adapt existing designs (e.g., for pipes or box culverts, retaining walls, fords, and decks of&#13;
bridges) and make them available to the Municipal Councils and associations. Standard&#13;
designs will include the following considerations, where appropriate: (a) engineering&#13;
aspects; (b) technical, financial and economic feasibility, (c) operation and maintenance;&#13;
(d) recommendations on environmental impact; and (e) social demand. This process will&#13;
be facilitated by the ongoing Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects in Bahia, Ceara and&#13;
Sergipe, and by the fact that other Northeast States will be developing similar projects&#13;
and, hence, there will be considerable scope for dissemination and exchange of designs&#13;
among the professionals of the PCU and the other State PCUs.&#13;
2.35  Appraisal. The appraisal of community subprojects would be carried out by the&#13;
Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-P) or the PCU (under PAC). The&#13;
appraisal procedures would take into account: (a) compliance with the project's guidelines&#13;
and eligibility criteria, including those related to the technical, environmental and cost&#13;
specifications contained in the Project Operational Manual; (b) the beneficiary&#13;
association's commitment to provide the required contribution and to take full&#13;
responsibility for the execution, operation and maintenance of the investments to be&#13;
funded; and (c) in the case of an association which has already benefited from other&#13;
subprojects, assessment of past performance. Using standardized cost indicators,&#13;
reasonable costing for subproject implementation would be ensured. Departures from&#13;
standard designs would have to be fully justified in the subproject proposal for review by&#13;
the Municipal Councils and/or the PCU, as would proposed investments which fall outside&#13;
the range of standardized costs.&#13;
2.36  Financing. In order to disburse funds for subproject implementation, agreements&#13;
(convenios) would be signed: (a) under FUMAC, between the PCU. the Municipal&#13;
Council and the beneficiary association for subproject funding and implementation; (b)&#13;
under FUMAC-P, between the Municipal Council and the association, for subproject&#13;
funding and implementation, and between the PCU and the Municipal Council for release&#13;
of project funds; and (c) under PAC, between the PCU and the beneficiary association for&#13;
subproject funding and implementation. Such agreements would spell out the terms and&#13;
conditions for the funding, execution, ownership, operation and maintenance of the&#13;
approved subprojects (para. 2.10). The final model agreements would form part of the&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.37  Subproject Supervision. Direct supervision and administration of the subprojects&#13;
are carried out by a community-elected Supervision and Control Committee (Annex D),&#13;
which oversees subproject execution, including contracting. This Committee of 3 to 4&#13;
persons is comprised of subproject beneficiaries, both members of the association and non-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
members within the community. The PCU, the Municipal Councils or other contracted&#13;
groups, would visit the subproject sites during subproject execution to liaise with the&#13;
Supervision Committee and monitor physical and financial progress. The PCU would&#13;
have overall responsibility for supervision of the entire subproject cycle through the&#13;
project Management Information System (MIS) (Annex H), which would track subproject&#13;
progress from initial submission to completion, and through accounting and auditing&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
2.38 Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M). Community associations would bear the&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M for all investments, as specified in the convenio for release of&#13;
project funds. These associations may request technical assistance to develop O&amp;M&#13;
programs and techniques. Experience to date under the NRDP has been positive with&#13;
respect to O&amp;M of investments when local communities have a strong sense of ownership.&#13;
2.39  Operational Checks and Balances. Operational checks and balances, included in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual, would promote transparency and accountability in the use&#13;
of project funds. Increased decentralization of resources and decision-making to&#13;
beneficiary associations and Municipal Councils, with only ex-post control by the State&#13;
through audit of accounts and supervision and monitoring by the PCU, is central to the&#13;
project strategy. However, this advancement would be accompanied by operational&#13;
disincentives, based mainly on education/joint problem solving and, as a last resort,&#13;
penalties, to deter potential departures from project guidelines such as misappropriation,&#13;
mistargeting, lack of participation or improper O&amp;M. Positive incentives for adherence to&#13;
project guidelines and or superior performance include the promotion of Municipal&#13;
Councils from FUMAC to FUMAC-P and, in FU1MAC-P, a potential increase in the&#13;
Councils' budget envelope.&#13;
2.40 Project Monitoring and Supervision. Analysis of implementation will depend&#13;
on a database of subproject information from the project MIS, created under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP and to be improved under the project (para. 2.16). Inputs to the&#13;
database would be made from a standard data sheet at key stages of the subproject cycle&#13;
(e.g., identification, appraisal, procurement and disbursement. See also Annex H).&#13;
Periodic processing of the database information will permit the monitoring of the&#13;
characteristics and evolution of project implementation. The PCU, with project Municipal&#13;
Councils, will be responsible for meeting and reporting on the project performance&#13;
indicators (para. 2.16). The Bank's Recife Office would monitor project performance&#13;
indicators through the MIS, which the Recife Office will maintain and update on a regular&#13;
basis with inputs from the states, and through review of monthly disbursement summaries.&#13;
The Recife Office will also supervise subproject implementation progress on a sample&#13;
basis in the field (see Annex J for Supervision Plan).&#13;
2.41   Project Operational Manual. The NRDP Operational Manual (Annex K) would&#13;
be adjusted and expanded to reflect the need for fine-tuning and additions based on&#13;
experience to date. Agreements were reached with the State during appraisal on the&#13;
following points to update and/or include in the Manual: (a) indicative quantitative and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
qualitative targets to be tracked with the Project MIS; (b) the project area and the criteria&#13;
used to select the municipalities included in the project area; (c) the initial distribution of&#13;
municipalities among the three components (FUMAC, FUMAC-P and PAC) and the&#13;
criteria for future redistribution; (d) guidelines for the pilot component (FUMAC-P); (e)&#13;
arrangements for institutional strengthening and project administration, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; (f) the PCU's new structure and additional technical support agreements with&#13;
other state agencies and non-governmental organizations; (g) FUMAC and FUMAC-P&#13;
Municipal Councils' composition, responsibilities and modus operandi, notably in relation&#13;
to FUMAC-P; (h) clear identification and description of responsibilities of beneficiaries&#13;
and municipalities in the implementation of subprojects; (i) guidelines for environmental&#13;
assessment of subprojects; (j) model agreements to be signed between the PCU, the&#13;
Municipal Councils and beneficiary associations; (k) new standard agreements between the&#13;
PCU and the FUMAC-P Municipal Councils and between the FUMAC-P Municipal&#13;
Councils and the beneficiary associations; (I) standard forms for proposals to be submitted&#13;
by potential beneficiaries; (m) the cost-sharing matrix for the various types of subprojects;&#13;
(n) the fund release mechanism to beneficiaries for FUMAC-P; (o) operational incentives&#13;
and penalties; (p) monitoring arrangements, including a new classification of the various&#13;
categories of subprojects; (q) standard project designs and their role in the appraisal of&#13;
proposals submitted by beneficiaries; (r) a revised standard form of acceptance of&#13;
completed works (ata de recebimento); and (s) targeting mechanisms and a community&#13;
graduation strategy.&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
2.42  The total project cost, calculated in May 1996 prices and including contingencies,&#13;
is estimated at US$40 million. Foreign exchange costs are estimated to be US$9.0&#13;
million, equivalent to about 23% of total project cost. The baseline cost is estimated at&#13;
US$39.4 million, and contingencies at US$0.6 million. Contingencies are low because&#13;
they apply only to the two components of institutional development (except for costs&#13;
associated with technical assistance for state reform) and project administration,&#13;
supervision, monitoring and evaluation. For these activities, physical contingencies of&#13;
10% and 5% have been included, as well as annual price increases for local and foreign&#13;
costs (both expressed in US dollars). No contingency provisions have been applied to the&#13;
community subprojects component. Since the number of community investments is not&#13;
defined ex ante, it was considered preferable that any change in physical or price attributes&#13;
of subproject investments would be accommodated by a change in the number of&#13;
subprojects approved and implemented.&#13;
2.43  Investments in subprojects are expected to represent some 90% of the total base&#13;
cost (59% for FUMAC, 7% for FUMAC-P and 24% for PAC). The distribution among&#13;
different categories of subprojects, as well as the phasing of expenditures over the four-&#13;
year implementation period, are indicative only, and there would be flexibility to reallocate&#13;
funds from the PAC to the FUMAC or FUMAC-P subcomponents as Municipal Councils&#13;
gain experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
2.44  The Borrower would be the State of Piaui. The loan would be guaranteed by the&#13;
Federative Republic of Brazil. In accordance with the Progress Report on the CAS&#13;
reviewed by the Board on June 20, 1996, and in reference to the strategy to be adopted&#13;
for special assistance to poor States, the State of Piaui qualifies as a Borrower in the&#13;
context of this loan. The State Government of Piaui has formulated and is adopting&#13;
measures for administrative and other state reforms that will improve its fiscal situation&#13;
and ensure its capacity to contribute required counterpart funding to the project and to&#13;
repay the loan. 10&#13;
2.45  The Bank loan would be repayable over 15 years, including a five-year grace&#13;
period, and would bear interest at the Bank's standard variable rate. The loan of US$30&#13;
million equivalent would finance about 75% of the total project cost, and would disburse&#13;
against 100% of expenditures for technical assistance, training and evaluation studies,&#13;
75% of expenditures for community subprojects, 50% of expenditures for supervision&#13;
(except salaries) and 20% of incremental project administrative costs (except salaries) and&#13;
monitoring. The State Government of Piaui would be responsible for the remaining 25%&#13;
of total project cost and, to meet its obligations, would involve the municipal governments&#13;
to share in thecounterpart financing responsibilities, a practice which it followed under the&#13;
reformuiated NRDP. The level of annual funding required under the new project would&#13;
be equivalent to less than one percent of the State's total budget. Beneficiaries would&#13;
provide a minimum of 10% of the total costs of community-managed investments, in cash,&#13;
labor or kind, amounting to US$3.6 million. To enable the early start-up of project&#13;
activities, retroactive financing would be provided up to a maximum of US$3.0 million in&#13;
respect of eligible project expenditures incurred up to 12 months before loan signing but&#13;
after July 1, 1996, when the project was appraised. In addition to training for new&#13;
Municipal Councils, the State already has a substantial pipeline of community subprojects&#13;
for review and financing for which it can utilize this retroactive financing facility. Detailed&#13;
project costs and the financing plan are presented in the table below.&#13;
2.46  Cost Sharing and Sustainability. The cost estimates and average size of&#13;
community-managed subproject investments have been determined based on the&#13;
experience gained under the reformulated NRDP and the operation of its PAC and&#13;
FUMAC components. On this basis, the project is expected to finance some 1,770&#13;
community-managed subprojects over four years. Counterpart contributions by the&#13;
beneficiary communities and their respective municipal governments would be made&#13;
according to a cost-sharing matrix, were agreed with the State Government at appraisal&#13;
among the improvements to the Operational Manual (para. 2.41) and to be included in the&#13;
project Operational Manual. The minimum contribution of beneficiaries would be 10%.&#13;
10  An annex on Fiscal Sustainability and Technical Assistance for State Reform is available to the&#13;
Executive Directors upon request.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
This contribution would increase as communities move toward graduation from the&#13;
project. The contribution of municipal governments would be 5% (recommended but not&#13;
required). The relative share contributed by each community and municipal government&#13;
would be based on agreement between the two parties with the Municipal Council. As in&#13;
the existing NRDP, ownership of project facilities by the beneficiaries should enhance the&#13;
sustainability of community investments. A key element would be the establishment of&#13;
sound arrangements under the project for the provision of operating, maintenance and&#13;
capital replacement expenditures, the requirements for which would vary significantly&#13;
among types of subprojects and the availability of which would vary by municipality and&#13;
community association. The Project Operational Manual and the subproject agreements&#13;
(convenios) (para. 2. 10) would contain specific guidelines concerning the funding of these&#13;
costs.&#13;

2.47   Experience since reformulation indicates that the sustainability of the proposed&#13;
projects is generally good. The community-based subprojects would finance relatively&#13;
small investments which can easily be maintained by the communities themselves, both&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
technically and financially, as demonstrated under the NRDP, even prior to the 1993&#13;
reformulation with the APCR component (see para. 1.13). Equally important is the fact&#13;
that client-driven subprojects, identified and implemented by the communities, have&#13;
demonstrated a high degree of ownership by the beneficiary groups and their consequent&#13;
willingness to maintain project investments. Under the reformulated NRDP, commitment&#13;
by each community group for operation and maintenance was a condition for the approval&#13;
of subprojects, and formed part of the subproject agreement to be signed with the&#13;
beneficiary community. Compliance has been good and these same features are built into&#13;
the proposed project. Finally, the formation and strengthening of project Municipal&#13;
Councils, which have been piloted successfully under the reformulated NRDP and will&#13;
continue under the proposed project, stimulate grassroots participation in local&#13;
development, and thus foster longer-term project sustainability.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
2.48  Procurement for community subprojects costing the equivalent of US$50,000 or&#13;
less and procured by local communities, would be carried out mainly through direct&#13;
contracting, and under subproject arrangements signed between the PCU and the&#13;
community. This procurement procedure is appropriate because most subprojects: (a)&#13;
would be small and/or implemented in scattered or remote areas and therefore it will be&#13;
difficult to obtain competitive proposals; (b) can be managed directly by rural communities&#13;
which will contribute to the work through the donation of unskilled labor and local&#13;
materials; (c) will be selected on the basis of willingness of the beneficiary communities to&#13;
contribute to and physically supervise their execution; and (d) would provide a vehicle for&#13;
communities to play an active role in the local development process. There may be cases&#13;
when the community lacks the capacity to make the necessary purchases of equipment and&#13;
materials. For such subprojects, the PCU would make purchases on behalf of the&#13;
communities, packaging the procurement for several subprojects whenever possible.&#13;
Procurement by the PCU would follow: (i) National Shopping procedures for goods, and&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank for procurement of small works under lump sum, fixed&#13;
price contracts awarded on the basis of price quotations (under US$ 100,000 and up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$0.8 million for goods and US$0.8 million for small works); or&#13;
(ii) National Competitive Bidding -- NCB (over US$100,000). For NCB the standard&#13;
bidding documents agreed between the Bank and the Federal Government of Brazil will be&#13;
used. ICB is not anticipated for any goods or works under the project. Although the&#13;
costs of individual subprojects may not exceed US$50,000, the average size of the&#13;
subprojects is expected to be less than US$30,000. Approximately 450 subprojects are&#13;
expected to be implemented yearly using these procurement methods.&#13;
2.49 Prior review of procurement documentation by the Bank would be made for all&#13;
NCB contracts. Although the level of Bank prior review of procurement would be low, it&#13;
would be compensated for in several ways. First, a study of procurement by community&#13;
contracting would be carried out during the first year of the project, under terms of&#13;
reference agreed during appraisal. Second, cost comparisons of similar subprojects would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
be conducted using the project MIS (para. 2.16) in order to detect possible procurement&#13;
problems. Third, the project physical performance evaluation (Annex H) would analyze&#13;
procurement issues; and finally, during Bank supervision, random reviews would be&#13;
conducted of subprojects, including field visits and review of subproject documentation.&#13;
2.50   Consultant services to provide technical assistance and training to the beneficiary&#13;
communities, the Municipal Councils and the PCU would be procured in accordance with&#13;
Bank guidelines for the use of consultants. Contracts, short lists, and selection procedures&#13;
for technical assistance and training would receive prior review by the Bank when the&#13;
value of the contract is US$ 100,000 or more for consulting firms or US$50,000 or more&#13;
for individual consultants. All consultant terms of reference would be subject to Bank&#13;
prior review. During negotiations, assurances were provided by the State of Piaui that: (a)&#13;
the above procurement arrangements would be followed (para. 3.1(d)); and (b) the study&#13;
of procurement by community contracting referred to in para. 2.49 would be carried out&#13;
during the first year of the project and any agreed recommendations adopted expeditiously&#13;
(para. 3.1 (d)). Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below.&#13;

2.51  The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of four years. The&#13;
project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2000, and the project's Closing Date&#13;
is June 30, 2001. The disbursement period shown in the projected Disbursement Schedule&#13;
(Annex I) is shorter than the Bank's standard disbursement profile for rural development&#13;
projects in Brazil, but is in line with the recent experience under the reformulated NRDP&#13;
and with other Bank-financed social fund projects in Latin America. The allocation of&#13;
loan proceeds by disbursement category is shown in Annex I.&#13;
2.52  During negotiations, assurances were provided by the State of Piaui that it would&#13;
open and maintain a Special Account in US Dollars in a commercial bank for Bank&#13;
disbursements (para. 3. 1(e)). The authorized allocation would be US$2.5 million,&#13;
adequate to cover the expected average four-month flow of disbursements under the&#13;
project. Disbursements for all expenditures would be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs), except for goods and works exceeding US$100,000 equivalent;&#13;
contracts with consulting firms above US$100,000 equivalent; and with individuals above&#13;
US$50,000.&#13;
2.53  The information required for the compilation of SOEs would be maintained by the&#13;
PCU in the MIS data base. All SOEs would be transmitted by the PCU to the Bank in&#13;
Washington. Simultaneously, the PCU would send to the Bank's Recife Office a copy of&#13;
SOEs and reimbursement applications submitted to the Bank in Washington, as well as&#13;
updated information on the status of all subprojects, enabling a rapid review of subproject&#13;
eligibility. This procedure would allow the Bank and the PCU management to maintain a&#13;
cumulative account of the progress of project implementation.&#13;
2.54  The communities' contributions to subproject investments would be defined in the&#13;
agreement (convenio) between the PCU and the community association (for PAC),&#13;
between the PCU, the Municipal Council and the association (FUMAC) or between the&#13;
Municipal Council and the community association (FUMAC-P). Any contributions by&#13;
Municipal Governments would also be defined in the subproject agreements. Both&#13;
contributions would be computed as part of counterpart finance of the project.&#13;
Disbursements to the beneficiary associations would be made in one single installment to&#13;
facilitate the disbursement process. Simple, standard records, whose format would be&#13;
included in the Operational Manual, would be completed by a designated community&#13;
representative. They would be used to record cash contributions, materials and labor&#13;
inputs, and would be subject to project audit procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
2.55  The PCU would maintain separate accounts for project expenditures, which would&#13;
be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The accounts of the&#13;
Municipal Councils (for the FUMAC-P subcomponent) and of the community associations&#13;
would also be subject to review by the independent auditors on a sample basis. Finally,&#13;
independent auditors would also audit the Special Account (para. 2.52). Copies of the&#13;
audit reports would be provided to the Bank within six months of the end of each state&#13;
fiscal year. The audit reports would convey the auditor's opinion and comment as&#13;
necessary on the methodology employed in the compilation of the statements of&#13;
expenditure, their accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents, eligibility for&#13;
financing in terms of the project's legal agreements and standards of record keeping and&#13;
internal controls related to the foregoing. The State of Piaui provided assurances during&#13;
negotiations that: (a) the Special Account and the project accounts would be established,&#13;
maintained and audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing principles, by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (b) with respect to withdrawals on the basis&#13;
of SOEs, that such audits would contain a separate opinion as to whether the SOEs,&#13;
together with the procedures involved in their preparation, support the related&#13;
withdrawals; and (c) certified copies of the audited accounts and of the auditors' reports&#13;
would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each project fiscal year&#13;
(para. 3.1(f)).&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.56  The proposed project has been assigned a "B" environmental classification.&#13;
Because of their relatively small size, most PAC, FUMAC, and FUMAC-P subprojects&#13;
would not have a significant effect on the environment. The project would, however,&#13;
ensure proper environmental screening and enforcement measures, to prevent certain types&#13;
of productive or infrastructure subprojects from producing negative effects on the&#13;
environment. The Operational Manual would specify key environmental criteria and&#13;
screening and enforcement procedures to be followed.&#13;
2.57  Based on specific criteria for different subproject types, each subproject proposal&#13;
presented by the community associations would include a simple environmental&#13;
assessment in the form of a "checklist", following a standard format. For standard&#13;
subproject types, environmental considerations are included in the standard subproject&#13;
designs (para. 2.34) and environmental screening at the subproject approval stage would&#13;
be the responsibility of the PCU and Municipal Councils. For exceptional subproject&#13;
types, for which technical standards have not been developed, the PCU would screen the&#13;
subproject proposals in detail for environmental impact, contracting technical assistance&#13;
when necessary, and this assessment and any subsequent recommendations would be&#13;
incorporated into the subproject proposal. For the FUMAC-P subprojects, the Municipal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Councils would conduct the environmental screening together with either the PCU or with&#13;
contracted technical assistance, such as NGOs. The PCU has identified expertise within&#13;
the state for technical assistance purposes and would include environmental education and&#13;
awareness as part of its training to Municipal Councils. Enforcement of environmental&#13;
criteria would be ensured via subproject supervision by the PCU and Municipal Councils.&#13;
Poverty Category&#13;
2.58  The proposed project is part of the Bank's Program of Targeted Interventions.&#13;
Project municipalities in Piaui were determined based on poverty-related indicators and&#13;
other key parameters (see Annex C), which will ensure that project resources reach those&#13;
municipalities which contain a high concentration of rural poor. The project's targeting&#13;
mechanism is then centered on community-based selection, with the assumption that local&#13;
communities can best judge what their investment priorities are in each municipality. In&#13;
particular, project Municipal Councils would be charged with targeting poor rural dwellers&#13;
and especially vulnerable groups, based on criteria including the socio-economic situation&#13;
of participating communities, their level of organization and the availability of&#13;
infrastructure and services. The transparency of rules and procedures for Municipal&#13;
Councils also would facilitate targeting under the project by permitting rural communities&#13;
to monitor local resource allocation decisions. Finally, communities which eventually are&#13;
determined to have capacity for sustainable asset accumulation (savings) and access to&#13;
adequate social and economic infrastructure, would progressively be charged a higher&#13;
cost-sharing percentage and then would be graduated out of the program (para. 2.31).&#13;
Women's Participation&#13;
2.59  The full participation of women is critical to the poverty objectives of the project.&#13;
Bank-supported operations and studies in the Northeast of Brazil show the strong&#13;
correlation between the problems and needs of rural women and those of producers and&#13;
family units in general. Interestingly enough, they also show that community leaders in the&#13;
Northeast favor women's participation due to their willingness to provide assistance and&#13;
services, receptiveness to change, and greater likelihood of repaying debt. Responding to&#13;
lessons concerning women's participation, this project will seek to ensure that women's&#13;
activities (both traditional and innovative) are included; to support subprojects which&#13;
foster maternal/child health and day care facilities (the latter have proven invaluable under&#13;
the ongoing PAC/FUMAC operations in freeing rural women for income generating&#13;
activities); to target groups and activities in which female participation has proven&#13;
constructive; to provide technical assistance for women's subproject proposals and&#13;
implementation; and to monitor women's participation in the project and its benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
2.60  The proposed project would result in an improved quality of life for some 810,000&#13;
people (162,000 families) (43% of the target population'°), by providing improved access&#13;
to water supply and other basic social and economic infrastructure and services, and by&#13;
contributing to an increase in production, incomes and employment. Project-financed&#13;
rural water supply and minor irrigation works will be particularly important in reducing&#13;
vulnerability to drought. Productive subprojects will provide a vehicle for financing&#13;
improvements in input use, technology and value-adding activities, thus raising&#13;
productivity and incomes. Female community members will benefit especially from&#13;
subprojects such as water supply and some productive activities and social investments&#13;
which enable rural women to seek paying jobs and contribute to increased family cash&#13;
incomes. Annex B provides an assessment of the kind of benefits which have been&#13;
achieved to date for the most common types of subprojects under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP. These are illustrative of the kinds of benefits to the target population which are&#13;
expected, albeit on a larger scale, from the proposed project.&#13;
2.61   The proposed project will provide a safety net for some of the poorest segments of&#13;
Piaui's rural population who will likely continue to be affected by decreased public&#13;
investments for services during the period of fiscal adjustment and macroeconomic reform.&#13;
Another important project benefit will be the strengthening of the capacity of poor&#13;
municipalities and their communities to define and address priority needs, and to plan and&#13;
execute their own development projects. It is expected that the new project will have a&#13;
similar impact on the mobilization of additional community and municipal resources, as&#13;
has the reformulated NRDP thus far (about 20% of resources invested by the program),&#13;
and this will improve the longer-term sustainability of investments. Project-related&#13;
benefits can potentially generate savings for state and municipal governments as well by&#13;
reducing certain budgetary obligations to rural areas, such as emergency water supply&#13;
through water trucks (carros pipa) or medical services. Finally, as a result of benefits&#13;
from the project which lead to an overall improvement in community organization and&#13;
well-being and capacity to save, it is expected that a small number of beneficiary&#13;
communities will graduate from the project and gain access to alternative sources of&#13;
financing.&#13;
10  Assumes 10% of the beneficiaries are "repeater" beneficiaries and benefit from more than one&#13;
subproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
2.62  Bank experience in Latin America and elsewhere suggests that the main sources of&#13;
risk for this type of program arise from: (a) irregular counterpart funding, which can&#13;
erode community confidence and interest in participating; (b) technical weaknesses and&#13;
inadequate supervision of large numbers of widely dispersed subprojects; (c) mistargeting&#13;
of program resources; and (d) undue political interference in subproject selection, which&#13;
often has the corollary effect of depressing local initiative and community involvement.&#13;
The funding risk will be mitigated by several distinguishing features of the projects. The&#13;
Bank loan, which will finance 75% of total project expenditures, will be taken directly by&#13;
the State, thereby eliminating those disbursement delays previously encountered at the&#13;
Federal level and minimizing the overall counterpart funding obligation of the State. In&#13;
addition, counterpart funding responsibilities would be shared to a larger extent by the&#13;
municipalities, decreasing the relative proportion of the State's own participation, and,&#13;
unlike in the reformulated NRDP, beneficiary contributions under the proposed project&#13;
will be counted toward the global counterpart requirements. The project will also help&#13;
address the State's fiscal deficit situation with technical assistance funds for administrative&#13;
reforms, thereby reducing the risk of counterpart funding difficulties. Finally, and perhaps&#13;
most importantly, the strong sense of ownership by the State, municipalities and&#13;
communities should help to protect project counterpart funding needs during the process&#13;
of allocating scarce budget resources. The risks of overdesign and weak supervision at&#13;
the subproject level would be substantially reduced with the establishment of standard&#13;
technical designs and cost criteria for the most common types of subprojects, and a&#13;
reinforced institutional strengthening component with specific resources allocated to&#13;
technical assistance for community associations. Increased delegation of supervision&#13;
responsibilities by the PCU to Municipal Councils and contracted public and non-&#13;
governmental agencies, will increase supervision coverage and will minimize the risk of&#13;
mistargeting of program resources. In addition, the project design has introduced a&#13;
system of strong operational disincentives against mistargeting and other departures from&#13;
project guidelines. For instance, a community or municipality would be obligated to&#13;
redress the problem, or be cut off entirely from the program, in cases of misappropriation,&#13;
mistargeting or insufficient participation. Finally, an information campaign targeted to&#13;
potential beneficiaries and the expansion of the FUMAC and FUMAC-P programs, will&#13;
stimulate greater community participation and increase transparency in the selection of&#13;
subprojects and thereby work against negative political influence in the allocation of&#13;
project resources.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PIAUI&#13;
A. SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE OF THE STATE OF&#13;
PIAUI&#13;
Geography and Climate&#13;
1.    The State of Piaui is the third largest state in the Northeast region of Brazil,&#13;
occupying 252,378 km2 in the western corner of the region, and is also, overall, its&#13;
poorest. The majority of the state area falls in the "drought polygon" and therefore suffers&#13;
from frequent drought and challenging agro-climatic conditions which, combined with a&#13;
skewed land distribution (para. 6), have exacerbated the difficult socio-economic&#13;
circumstances of the rural population of Piaui. The state's geographic profile varies&#13;
greatly from east to west and from interior to coastline. The southeastern part of the&#13;
state, which borders Ceara, Bahia and Pernambuco, is enveloped by the semi-arid region&#13;
and experiences average rainfalls of only 600 mm per year. The western part of the state&#13;
consists of cerrado (savannah) vegetation and soils with average annual rainfall varying&#13;
between 800 and 1400 mm. From east to west, various transition zones exist between the&#13;
semi-arid and cerrado regions. Along the small coastline and down the Parnaiba river&#13;
valley in the upper northwestern portion of the state, average annual rainfalls reach 1600&#13;
mm, corresponding to a pocket of rainforest.&#13;
2.    Piaui has few important rivers outside of the Parnaiba river which separates the&#13;
states of Piaui and Maranhao. Nevertheless, other perennial rivers in the western part of&#13;
the state, specifically the Gurgueia and the Uru,ui Preto, together with cerrado soils have&#13;
contributed to fertile river basins with over 4 million ha of potentially exploitable land for&#13;
dry or irrigated agriculture. In addition, according to studies by SUDENE, Piaui boasts&#13;
the most abundant aquifer in the Northeast which, combined with other less-important&#13;
rivers, offers great potential for irrigated agriculture in humid river valleys.&#13;
Demographic and Social Situation&#13;
3.    Piaui has long been regarded as one of the poorest states in Brazil, and this claim is&#13;
borne out in socio-economic indicators. The population of Piaui stands at 2.6 million&#13;
(1991) of which 47% reside in rural areas. The state capital, Teresina, was ranked&#13;
according to Mapa da Fome as the Brazilian state capital with the highest rate of&#13;
indigence and, to make matters worse, it had the lowest rate of indigence relative to all the&#13;
other municipalities in Piaui'. In fact, as evidence of the miserable conditions in which the&#13;
Indigence is defined as the level of income that corresponds, at the maximum, to the value of a "basic food&#13;
basket" that meets a family's minimun nutritional requirements, as defined by FAO/WHO. Source: Mapa da&#13;
Fome, IPEA, March 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -                           Annex A&#13;
vast majority of the Piauense population lives, in 90% of Piaui's municipalities, 6 out of&#13;
every 10 families are considered indigent. According to a joint study done by UNICEF&#13;
and IBGE, 80% of the municipalities harbor very precarious living conditions critical for&#13;
childhood survival. Many of these unhealthy living conditions stem from a lack of&#13;
adequate infrastructure, particularly in rural areas: 97% of rural households have only&#13;
precarious access to water, compared with 40% in urban areas; and 93% of rural&#13;
households have no sanitary facilities, compared with 29% in urban areas. Many poor&#13;
families, particularly in rural areas, lack the basic education or income-generating activities&#13;
necessary to pull themselves out of poverty: according to an ARIDAS study (1991), for&#13;
every school aged child in the rural areas, 3.73 children are not attending school, while in&#13;
the urban areas this relation drops to 0.8; 60% of the rural population over 15 years of&#13;
age is illiterate, compared with 27% of the urban population (IBGE 1991); and 85% of&#13;
rural heads of household earn less than one minimum wage (currently estimated at&#13;
US$112 per month), compared with 54% in urban areas (IBGE 1991).&#13;
The State Economy&#13;
4.    The economy of the State of Piaui can be characterized as a rural economy and a&#13;
small-producer economy2. 51% of the economically active population is employed in the&#13;
agricultural sector, followed by 37% in the services sector and a mere 12% in the&#13;
industrial sector (PNAD, 1993). Despite the predominance of agriculture as the largest&#13;
employer in the state, by 1993, this sector generated only 14% of the state GDP, revealing&#13;
one of the primary causes of poverty in the rural sector. The services sector, on the other&#13;
hand, produced 64% of the state GDP and industry, 21%. Curiously, in light of an&#13;
agricultural recovery in 1994-1995 for the State of Piaui (117% growth) after the severe&#13;
drought of 1993, by 1995 agriculture was contributing 25% of state GDP and industry&#13;
only 14%, with services remaining steady at 61%. These shifts reveal the dependency of&#13;
the State on agricultural production, which itself is dramatically affected by climatic shifts&#13;
(para. 6), and the fragility of its industrial base. The industry sector is dominated by&#13;
micro- and small enterprises, which still require governmental support and lack necessary&#13;
infrastructure for commercialization of goods. The service industry is the engine of&#13;
growth in Piaui, driven by the rising urbanization of the State--urban population grew over&#13;
50% during the 1980s--and absorbing the influx of unskilled labor from the rural areas.&#13;
5.    As a result of this weak and unstable productive base, the GDP of Piaui is only&#13;
3.8% of the GDP of the Northeast, the lowest of the Northeastern states in conjunction&#13;
with the state of Sergipe which, while also generating only 3.8% of the Northeast GDP,&#13;
registered a GDP per capita 1.7 times higher than that of Piaui (1994, SUDENE).&#13;
Because of its weak productive activities, Piaui depends on the Federal Government for&#13;
about 44% of its total revenues (1995) and on the ICMS for 29%, and in collection of the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-                             Annex A&#13;
latter Piaui ranks last in the Northeast, contributing only 3.2% of the ICMS levied in the&#13;
Northeast (1994, SUDENE).&#13;
The Agricultural Sector&#13;
6.    The poor performance and productivity of the agricultural sector is principally&#13;
owed to three factors: concentration of land ownership; a low technological base; and&#13;
harsh agro-climatic conditions. Indicators on land tenure from the 1985 Agricultural&#13;
Census describe a semi-feudal agricultural system which explains much of Piaui's poverty:&#13;
72% of all farms are under 10 ha and represent just over 3% of total acreage cultivated,&#13;
however, half of one percent of all farms are over 1000 ha and represent 40% of total&#13;
acreage. In addition, of these small farmers with properties under 10 ha, over 50% are&#13;
renters or sharecroppers and not landowners in their own right. This significant&#13;
concentration of land illustrates a small farmer sector geared toward subsistence and not&#13;
commercial agriculture. Subsistence farmers are characterized by their traditional, non-&#13;
mechanized production practices and, without access to credit, use of minimal inputs&#13;
outside of labor. Government extension programs (EMATER) have slowly been&#13;
transferring more advanced technology to small farmers; however, without resolution of&#13;
the land tenure issue technology transfer will have little effect on overall productivity.&#13;
Finally, persistent droughts and the uneven distribution of rainfall, particularly in the semi-&#13;
arid region of the state, make the agricultural sector vulnerable to erratic climatic&#13;
conditions and cause significant fluctuations in income for the majority small farm&#13;
population. Absence of income generating opportunities in rural areas, combined with a&#13;
lack of social and economic infrastructure, induced a rural exodus to the cities during the&#13;
1980s (para. 4).&#13;
7.    The primary crops are of the subsistence type: rice, beans, corn, manioc and&#13;
cotton. Soybeans are the main cash crop, due to an in-migration from the south of Brazil&#13;
and to the cerrado soil conditions in the southwest of the state. However, soybeans are&#13;
almost exclusively a crop of the latifundistas, and despite being self-sufficient in grains,&#13;
the state depends on imports because of disorganized commercial channels which impede&#13;
efficient marketing of grains and other crops internally.&#13;
State Government Strategy to Alleviate Poverty&#13;
8.    The State Government of Piaui has expressed great concern with the pressing&#13;
problems of rural-urban migration, particularly in the capital city of Teresina, stemming&#13;
from the impoverished situation in the rural areas of the state. The State has oriented its&#13;
social programs toward the creation and strengthening of employment- and income-&#13;
generating opportunities, with particular emphasis on agriculture and agro-industry which&#13;
directly concerns the rural sector. The NRDP factors in as one of the State's most&#13;
important initiatives in this respect, along with Comunidade Solidaria and other smaller&#13;
social programs. In 1995, the State Government created the Deliberative Council for&#13;
Housing and Sanitation with the mandate to develop decentralized actions led by&#13;
municipal governments to improve housing and sanitation for the poorest populations. As&#13;
part of its economic development program outlined in the State Sustainable Development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -                          Annex A&#13;
Strategy, the State Government has embarked on an administrative reform program which&#13;
envisions an adjustment in the size of the public sector, its structure, functions, and&#13;
financing, and consequently would initiate processes of privatization and increased&#13;
partnerships with the private sector. These reforms, in addition to efforts to boost&#13;
irrigated agriculture and encourage the decentralization and municipalization of health and&#13;
education, would help public sector initiatives and social programs to operate more&#13;
efficiently.&#13;
Experience with Bank-Financed Development Programs&#13;
9.    The history of the State's involvement with Bank-financed rural development&#13;
programs is consistent with that of the other northeastern states: under&#13;
POLONORDESTE the Piaui Rural Development (Parnaiba Valley) Project (Loan 2015-&#13;
BR) met its physical targets but implementation and disbursement delays occurred due to&#13;
Federal counterpart funding and rural credit problems, drought, over-centralized project&#13;
administration and limited beneficiary participation in project planning and execution.&#13;
Poor coordination, duplication of effort and competition for scarce funds were also key&#13;
factors. But the project did strengthen state institutional capabilities, and established&#13;
services and infrastructure which contributed to agricultural modernization and laid the&#13;
groundwork for further rural development programs. In addition, the project is one of the&#13;
few in the Northeast that has successfully implemented a comprehensive set of land&#13;
acquisition and distribution activities.&#13;
10.   The Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP), initiated between 1985 and&#13;
1987, was largely unable to improve on the performance of POLONORDESTE but did&#13;
successfully launch the community-based rural development methodology through the&#13;
small APCR component; Piaui's experience also conformed to this pattern. The NRDP,&#13;
like POLONORDESTE, also did make other important contributions: it paved the way&#13;
for administrative decentralization, a more strategic approach to rural development, the&#13;
involvement of NGOs and a greater role for communities in project planning and&#13;
execution. The NRDP projects in each of the northeast states were reformulated in 1993&#13;
by essentially converting the successful APCR component into the primary model.&#13;
11.   The reformulated NRDP in Piaui has disbursed very well but experienced problems&#13;
with subproject quality (see Annex B for details). Following strong and detailed&#13;
recommendations from the Bank, outlined in an "emergency" plan, the State Government&#13;
has taken measures to address issues in subproject performance, which has notably&#13;
improved in recent months. The Technical Unit (Unidade Tecnica do PAPP-Piaui) is also&#13;
undergoing a thorough restructuring (see Annex D). Counterpart funding availability in&#13;
light of a severe fiscal crisis remains a serious problem but the state is adopting&#13;
administrative reform measures to alleviate the impact of the crisis (para. 8).&#13;
12.   The NRDP-Piaui project closed on June 30, 1996. Of the original NRDP loan of&#13;
US$78 million, signed on July 20, 1987, US$34 million had been disbursed at the time of&#13;
reformulation. Since then, another US$17.7 million were disbursed and another US$1.1&#13;
million fully committed, which together with the cancellation of US$25 million in&#13;

- 42 -                          Annex A&#13;
December 1994, leaves an outstanding balance of only US$0.3 million. The rate of&#13;
disbursements improved resoundingly after the NRDP reformulation: prior to&#13;
reformulation, the NRDP-Piaui project disbursed an average of US$5.6 million annually&#13;
and after reformulation this rate jumped to US$7.5 million. By the Closing Date,&#13;
beneficiary communities had submitted some 3,945 proposals, of which 1,569 were&#13;
financed. 68% of the subprojects financed were for infrastructure investments, 20% were&#13;
for productive activities and 12% were for social investments, the second highest rate of&#13;
social subprojects implemented in the NRDP behind the State of Sergipe.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PIAUI&#13;
B. THE REFORMULATED NORTHEAST RURAL&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (NRDP): PERFORMANCE&#13;
AND EVALUATION&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    With more than half of all Brazilians living in poverty and almost two-thirds of the&#13;
country's rural poor, the Northeast --covering nine States and a part of a tenth1-- has long&#13;
constituted the single largest rural poverty pocket in Latin America. Rural development&#13;
programs for this region have been financed by the Federal and State Governments since the&#13;
early 1970s, but all achievedlimited success in alleviating poverty -- including the Northeast&#13;
Rural Development Program (NRDP), which was established in 1985 to improve living&#13;
standards of small farm families and reduce poverty in the Northeast. Through 1993, with&#13;
the exception of one component supporting small community projects, implementation of&#13;
the NRDP lagged behind schedule, and performance in meeting basic project objectives was&#13;
weak. However, its innovative community-based component, Apoio as Pequenas&#13;
Comunidades Rurais (APCR), relying on community planning and organization and&#13;
acknowledging the expressed needs of the communities, produced very encouraging --and&#13;
replicable-- results: the poverty alleviation impact of the APCR was positive, the cost per&#13;
family relatively low, and its disbursement and commitment rates far exceeded those of&#13;
other components. In 1993, drawing both on the successful experience of the APCR&#13;
component and on lessons learned with similar schemes elsewhere in Latin America, the&#13;
NRDP was reformulated and transformed in its entirety into a community-based&#13;
development program. This reformulation, concomitant with the administrative and fiscal&#13;
decentralization embodied in the new Brazilian constitution of 1988, decentralized decision-&#13;
making, program counterpart funding and implementation, from the Federal Government to&#13;
the States and local levels. It allowed rural communities to identify their own needs and&#13;
execute their own subprojects, while committing themselves to contributing to the cost of&#13;
the investments and taking charge of their operation and maintenance (O&amp;M).&#13;
Reformulation was effective in late 1993 and became fully operational in all states in&#13;
January 1994.&#13;
2.    Under the reformulated NRDP, matching grants are provided to rural community&#13;
associations to finance small-scale subprojects identified by these groups as priority&#13;
investments to improve community well-being. Choosing among eligible subprojects, the&#13;
The Northeast Region includes the States of Maranhao, Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba,&#13;
Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia and the northern part of the State of Minas Gerais.&#13;

beneficiaries solicit investments which respond to their most critical needs. There are two&#13;
different delivery mechanisms for screening, approving and implementing community&#13;
subprojects: (i) State Community Schemes (PAC) in which rural communities submit&#13;
their subproject investment proposals directly to the State Project Technical Unit (TU).&#13;
The TU screens, approves and releases funds for subprojects, interacting directly with the&#13;
beneficiaries; and (ii) Pilot Municipal Community Schemes (FUMAC), in which&#13;
subprojects identified and prepared by rural communities are presented to project Municipal&#13;
Councils for review. The Councils, composed of community members, local government&#13;
representatives and representatives of civil society, promote local-level consensus-building&#13;
on priority needs through open "town meetings", and screen and submit subprojects to the&#13;
State for subsequent approval and financing. This pilot was designed originally to reach&#13;
only 10 municipalities per state but, due to its early success, it has surpassed this initial&#13;
target.&#13;
3.    This Annex presents a performance and impact analysis of almost three years of&#13;
implementation of the reformulated NRDP, as a result of an evaluation undertaken by FAO&#13;
(United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) and the Bank between October 1995&#13;
and May 1996, and updated at appraisal of the proposed Rural Poverty Alleviation project.&#13;
Certain aspects of the analysis, based on the most recent information from NRDP's&#13;
Simplified Project Monitoring System (SSMP) as well as findings of earlier studies, cover&#13;
the overall program in the ten participating states. Other aspects, in particular the socio-&#13;
economic impact of subproject investments, have been analyzed specifically for the state of&#13;
Piaui. Featured below are: (i) the information base used for the evaluation; (ii) the status of&#13;
implementation to date in all ten states, with respect to NRDP subprojects and disbursements;&#13;
(iii) an impact analysis of the reformulated NRDP at the state and municipal levels for the ten&#13;
states, and at the local level for the state of Piaui; (iv) the advantages of FUMAC over PAC, the&#13;
two delivery mechanisms available in the NRDP; (v) a technical assessment of subprojects; (vi)&#13;
an assessment of institutional performance in the program, and (vii) conclusions and&#13;
recommendations for design improvements for follow-up projects.&#13;
4.    Results of different evaluations of NRDP since its reformulation show that after&#13;
several years of experience with rural development efforts in the Northeast, a large measure&#13;
of success has been achieved in effectively reaching the rural poor through targeted&#13;
interventions. However, some aspects of program implementation and its innovative&#13;
features are still in need of improvement, which could be addressed by modifications to&#13;
project design. The design of follow-up projects should explicitly take into account the&#13;
lessons derived from this and other evaluations of the NRDP, which are consistent in many&#13;
respects with lessons learned elsewhere in Latin America and other regions with similar&#13;
community-based development programs.&#13;

(a)   The Simplified Project Monitoring System (SSMP) of the Bank's Recife&#13;
Office, which is the major data base for the reformulated NRDP from which&#13;
the performance of the project in each state is monitored. The SSMP is&#13;
updated monthly and stores key information, including the number and types&#13;
of community subprojects at the different stages of implementation, number&#13;
of beneficiary communities, subproject costs, procurement and disbursement&#13;

(b)   Impact evaluation findings from surveys by the Bank/FAO in October 1995&#13;
and May 1996, of the most common types of subprojects found in Piaui.&#13;
The surveys focus on the following aspects: (a) the process of subproject&#13;
identification, implementation, technical assistance and supervision; (b) the&#13;
nature of the subproject (investments funded); (c) socio-economic&#13;
results/impact of the subproject; and (d) special qualitative and quantitative&#13;

Michigan's "Baseline and Popular Participation Study", initiated in 1993 by&#13;
Kottak and Costa, and followed by a community impact evaluation analysis&#13;
based on field surveys covering 38 communities in 23 municipalities of 9&#13;
states (Minas Gerais was not included) in July-October 1994; (iii) a series of&#13;

sampling methodology.2&#13;
STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Subprojects and Beneficiaries&#13;
6.    Statistical information from the SSWP on the performance of all ten states&#13;
participating in the reformulated NRDP is presented in Tables 1 to 6. As of June 30, 1996,&#13;
about 41,000 PAC and FUMAC subproject proposals had been submitted by communities&#13;
in all ten states. Of the total, 59% or 23,910 subprojects had been approved, of which&#13;
13,758 were completed and/or under implementation (Table 1). Negotiations with intended&#13;
beneficiary associations on the terms of agreement and other issues were in process on the&#13;
other 10,202 approved subprojects.&#13;
7.    To date, the reformulated NRDP has reached nearly 40% of rural poor families in&#13;
the ten Northeast states, including "repeater" families which have benefited from more than&#13;
one subproject. Based on the experience of Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte, it is&#13;
estimated that only 10% of community associations are repeater associations and, because&#13;
some associations may represent more than one community, that the number of repeater&#13;
communities is even smaller. Those with more than one subproject typically are better&#13;
organized than others or, as in the case of Rio Grande do Norte, are supported by NGOs or&#13;
other technical assistance agencies. Accumulating benefits from different subprojects has a&#13;
significant impact on local development and would be an important element of a graduation&#13;
strategy (para. 20). Nevertheless, it is equally important that TUs strengthen their outreach&#13;
program to reach previously unattended communities, particularly those lacking&#13;
organizational strength.&#13;
8.    Overall, some 120 different types of subprojects have been proposed by rural&#13;
communities, a large majority of which relate to basic rural infrastructure, followed by&#13;
productive subprojects (mostly small-scale agro-processing and communal tractors) and, to&#13;
a lesser extent, investments of a social nature (e.g., day care centers or house&#13;
improvement). Table 2 shows community demand for the most common types of&#13;
subprojects for the NRDP as a whole, and separately for the states of Pernambuco, Rio&#13;
Grande do Norte and Piaui. While it is clear that water supply and rural electrification are&#13;
in great demand everywhere, communities in certain states like Rio Grande do Norte,&#13;
encouraged by the state TUs, also tend to favor productive investments. The nature of&#13;
subprojects eventually financed generally corresponds to community demand: out of the&#13;
total number of subprojects that were completed or under implementation as of end-June&#13;
2   This methodology was built on statistical random sampling procedures from a universe of all&#13;
subprojects under implementation and/or completed at the beginning of 1995, as obtained from the&#13;
SSMP. The distribution of the sample for a given type of subproject among the states was based on the&#13;
distribution frequency of such subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -                          Annex B&#13;
1996, 58% were for rural infrastructure, 36% were productive subprojects and only 6%&#13;
were social subprojects (Table 1).&#13;
9.    Local screening of subprojects accelerates processing; thus, in the FUMAC mode,&#13;
there are more subprojects per municipality than in PAC, more beneficiaries per subproject&#13;
and lower costs per beneficiary. In the ten states, subprojects approved under FUMAC&#13;
represent about 20% of the total, even though the pilot nature of this component limited it&#13;
to some 11% of recipient municipalities. On average, 16.6 subprojects have been&#13;
implemented per municipality under FUMAC, compared with 10.1 under PAC (Table 3).&#13;
Although the costs of PAC and FUMAC subprojects are similar (Table 4), FUMAC&#13;
subprojects involve at least 10% more beneficiaries, resulting in a lower implementation&#13;
cost per beneficiary. Among the ten states, Paraiba has the highest proportion of FUMAC&#13;
subprojects (62% of all subprojects approved in the state) while Alagoas finds itself at the&#13;
other extreme, having only 6% of all subprojects implemented under FUMAC. Indeed,&#13;
depending on the local political situation, conditions favorable to the FUMAC process, as&#13;
promoted under NRDP, differ from state to state.&#13;
10.   The average cost per subproject varies among project types, ranging from&#13;
US$14,200 for rice processing to US$32,500 for tractors and implements (Table 5). The&#13;
overall average cost is about US$24,000. As the nature and technical specification for a&#13;
particular type of subproject often differ substantially between states, there can also be large&#13;
variations in the corresponding costs.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
11.   Analysis of the progress of loan disbursements (including funds already committed)&#13;
as of July 19, 1996 (Table 6) shows that the program's disbursement rate has been&#13;
significantly higher than its historical equivalent before reformulation. In about two years&#13;
and a half, a total of US$267.3 million of loan funds has been disbursed or committed under&#13;
the program, or US$8.6 million per month, as compared to only US$3.5 million per month&#13;
during the whole implementation period of the original NRDP (1986-late 1993). It should&#13;
also be noted that municipalities in some states like Paraiba and Piaui have frequently&#13;
contributed counterpart funds in light of shortages at the state level. Overall, it is estimated&#13;
that 93% of project funds disbursed have reached the beneficiary communities directly, as&#13;
compared with only 44% under the original NRDP. There is now a total outstanding loan&#13;
balance of US$78.7 million, four of the loans having closed on December 31, 1995&#13;
(Sergipe, Rio Grande do Norte, Bahia and Ceara), two more on June 30, 1996&#13;
(Pernambuco and Piaui), and one on September 30, 1996 (Alagoas). The remainder are&#13;
scheduled to close on December 31, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                           Annex B&#13;
EVALUATION&#13;
State and Municipal Levels&#13;
12.   Based on conservative estimates derived from SSMP data and information provided&#13;
by the State TUs, there is ample evidence to show that the reformulated NRDP has been&#13;
cost-effective in attending to the rural poor in the Northeast and has a large potential to&#13;
produce tax revenue for the State and Municipal Governments. In particular:&#13;
13.   NRDP investments are potentially cost-saving for State governments, in terms both&#13;
of construction costs of subprojects and water supply. First, with respect to construction&#13;
costs, it has been shown that infrastructure projects implemented by government agencies&#13;
are, on average, about 30% more expensive than projects implemented by communities.&#13;
Merely assuming that half of all subprojects implemented are effectively 30% cheaper than&#13;
what they would have cost had they been implemented by government agencies, the savings&#13;
to the ten State governments in this regard would be equivalent to US$51 million for the&#13;
whole program as implemented to date (the total investment cost of the approximately&#13;
13,700 subprojects financed as of June 30, 1996 amounts to about US$340 million).&#13;
14.   Second, NRDP investments in water supply create savings with respect to State and&#13;
municipal budgetary resources spent on provision of water (by carro pipa or water bowser)&#13;
to rural communities, which is necessary not only in periods of drought but also in years of&#13;
"normal" precipitation in the semi-arid region of the Northeast. NRDP rural water supply&#13;
projects minimize that recurring expenditure and liberate these savings for other purposes.&#13;
Thus, for municipalities which have benefited from the 1,900 NRDP-financed water supply&#13;
projects to date, the actual annual savings to their respective budgets from not having to&#13;
provide the corresponding carros pipa are estimated to range --for all municipalities-- from&#13;
about US$5 million in a year of normal precipitation to more than US$11 million in a&#13;
drought year. In periods of severe drought, savings can also accrue to the Federal&#13;
Government, which normally provides substantial emergency funds to the states in these&#13;
periods.&#13;
15.   NRDP investments also generate tax revenue for the State and Municipal&#13;
governments on marketed outputs of productive subprojects. The principal tax applicable is&#13;
the Imposto sobre Circula,co de Mercadoria e Servi,os (ICMS), of which 75% goes to the&#13;
State and 25% is divided among the municipalities. Depending on the state, the ICMS rate&#13;
3~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#13;
varies according to the produCt3&#13;
In some states, as in Rio Grande do Norte and Pernambuco, some agricultural products (particularly&#13;
staples like manioc) are totally exempt of ICMS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -                           Annex B&#13;
Local Level&#13;
16.   At the community level, NRDP subprojects have begun to generate significant&#13;
improvements in the local economy and in the quality of life of the beneficiaries. Beyond its&#13;
impact at the state and municipal levels, the reformulated NRDP, as found in the overall&#13;
socio-economic impact evaluation (para. 5(d)) carried out by FAO and the Bank in&#13;
February 1995, has resulted in a much improved quality of life for the beneficiary&#13;
communities. In most cases, it has also started to generate increases in income and&#13;
employment opportunities, which would expand further as productive subprojects --most of&#13;
which have been operating for less than two years-- come to full maturity. And as&#13;
subproject benefits are largely concentrated in the beneficiary communities, they are leading&#13;
to savings accumulation, both at household and community level, and to improvements in&#13;
the local economy. These, in turn, contribute to preventing communities from migrating&#13;
elsewhere and, in some cases, to encouraging them to start small businesses and/or other&#13;
activities locally. Most of these findings are confirmed by the more recent, state-specific&#13;
evaluation which was completed in May 1996 in Piaui. In this state, more than 50&#13;
subprojects implemented to date were surveyed and six major types of investments financed&#13;
under the reformulated NRDP analyzed, accounting for more than 70% of all subprojects&#13;
approved in this state. In line with the profile of community demand in Piaui, most of the&#13;
subprojects that have been financed and executed are rural infrastructure subprojects; thus,&#13;
the 3 main types in this category --water supply, electrification and localized road&#13;
rehabilitation-- alone represent almost two-thirds of all subprojects approved in the state.&#13;
By contrast, productive subprojects are relatively few and those financed to date have been&#13;
operational for too short a time to have produced some measurable impact. Of the&#13;
productive subprojects surveyed in the field, data could be collected with a reasonable&#13;
degree of confidence only for clothes-making subprojects. An abbreviated description of&#13;
each of the main subproject types found in Piaui is presented below. For each, aggregate&#13;
SSMP data on the number of subprojects completed and/or under implementation, total&#13;
beneficiaries and average cost per beneficiary are shown in Table 7, while Table 8 gives&#13;
results of the financial/economic analysis undertaken for clothes-making subprojects.&#13;

Infrastructure Subprojects&#13;
(a)    Rural water supply. Drought, a frequent occurrence in the Northeast, can&#13;
have a devastating impact on the lives of communities in this region. In&#13;
Piaui, this phenomenon affects in particular the semi-arid region, which&#13;
accounts for 48% of the total state area and 31% (more than 800,000&#13;
people) of its population. On the other hand, Piaui --the majority of whose&#13;
territory is located within the "drought polygon"-- has one of the major&#13;
groundwater reserves of the Northeast, with wells averaging depth of 90 m&#13;
and recharge of 20,000 liters per hour, and containing water of generally&#13;
good quality. Water supply subprojects financed in this state are therefore&#13;
mostly for digging of wells, the other major type being construction of small&#13;
dams to retain surface water. Rural water supply projects provide a precious&#13;
resource which previously was obtained only through long hours of walking,&#13;
usually by women, or had to be supplied by the municipality by carropipa&#13;
(para. 14). They lead to savings in time, effort and cost, and often to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -                           Annex B&#13;
improved health through better sanitation with cleaner water than obtained&#13;
previously. However, these gains are difficult to quantify. In Piaui, it is&#13;
estimated that some 34,700 families are benefiting from the 509 subprojects&#13;
of this type that are currently in execution and/or already completed in the&#13;
state.&#13;
(b)   Rural electrification. Providing electricity to streets and households as&#13;
well as community shops and small-scale processing units, rural&#13;
electrification subprojects contribute to improving the quality of life of the&#13;
local inhabitants by giving them access to radio, television and the use of&#13;
domestic appliances, and in some cases generating additional employment&#13;
and incomes from the increased operation of local businesses and industries.&#13;
In Piaui, it is estimated that about 24,700 families are benefiting from the&#13;
343 rural electrification subprojects under implementation and/or already&#13;
completed. Rural households are charged an electricity fee, which varies&#13;
between the states.&#13;
(c)    Rural road rehabilitation. The shortage of public funds for infrastructure&#13;
works in Piaui --perhaps even more than in other Northeast states-- explains&#13;
the high demand that communities have for this type of subproject.&#13;
Investments are made under the NRDP to finance the localized rehabilitation&#13;
of village roads, with beneficiary communities participating by providing&#13;
unskilled labor in the construction works, usually in association with (and&#13;
some financial contribution from) the local prefeitura. The 164 road&#13;
rehabilitation subprojects that have been completed to date or are being&#13;
implemented in Piaui are expected to benefit in total 30,000 rural families.&#13;
Productive Subprojects&#13;
(a)    Clothes-making subprojects. A productive as well as social activity that is&#13;
very popular in states like Rio Grande do Norte and Ceara, this type of&#13;
subproject is also increasingly found in Piaui. The clothes produced are of&#13;
different kinds and sold on the local market (in some cases substituting for&#13;
imports) or at weekly fairs in the area. The 26 such subprojects which are&#13;
under implementation and/or have been completed in Piaui will benefit 780&#13;
families and create about 750 jobs, mostly for women. They would generate&#13;
an additional annual income of about US$100 per beneficiary.&#13;
Social Subprojects&#13;
(a)    Health-related house improvement. The dwellings of many rural families&#13;
in the Northeast, including in Piaui, are in poor condition and often&#13;
associated with lack of hygiene which can lead to very serious health&#13;
problems (e.g., the often fatal Chagas disease, which is spread by an insect&#13;
favoring wall materials of traditional rural houses in the interior). Although&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-                                Annex B&#13;
there apparently have been in Piaui a few abuses with this type of subproject&#13;
(e.g., improvements of houses without any health-related justification or with&#13;
acceptable sanitary conditions), indications are that consequent&#13;
improvements in the living conditions of most beneficiary families have an&#13;
important positive impact on their health. It is estimated that the 70 house&#13;
improvement subprojects under implementation and/or completed in this&#13;
state are benefiting about 5,600 families in total.&#13;
(b)    Rural health posts. Although only a few have been implemented to date,&#13;
this type of subproject is frequently requested by rural communities in Piaui.&#13;
Often substituting for lacking municipal funds, especially for infrastructure as&#13;
mentioned earlier, the NRDP finances civil works related to the construction&#13;
and/or rehabilitation of health posts in rural areas; municipalities --as is their&#13;
normal function-- then take over, providing for medicines and supplies and&#13;
operating these health posts. To date, 8 such subprojects have been&#13;
approved, benefiting an estimated 940 rural families.&#13;
17.    Generally, the analysis of sample cases surveyed indicates that the NRDP in Piaui&#13;
has made a positive impact on the quality of life and on employment and incomes of&#13;
beneficiary communities or associations. Some of the subprojects recently visited were&#13;
found to have had particularly beneficial social effects, such as the utilization of the profits&#13;
from a NRDP-financed community poultry-raising subproject in the municipality of&#13;
Esperantina to create jobs for poor adolescents living in the area. For clothes-making&#13;
subprojects, an analysis was also carried out to determine the internal economic rate of&#13;
return (IERR)4 as well as the cost-effectiveness of this type of investment. The financial&#13;
analysis was made assuming constant benefits over an eight-year subproject cycle, and cost&#13;
effectiveness was determined by estimating the total investment cost per additional job&#13;
created and the benefit-cost ratio. Results, as shown in Table 8, are satisfactory: the&#13;
financial IERR was estimated at 33%, the benefit-cost ratio at 1.4 and the investment per&#13;
job created is low at US$570, which is at least 10 times lower than in the industry and&#13;
service sectors. Nevertheless, given the sampling nature of the exercise and the variations&#13;
that exist among subprojects in terms both of costs and performance, these results should be&#13;
taken as illustrative only.&#13;
18.   Owing to insufficient data, no detailed analysis could be made of the financial&#13;
sustainability of productive subprojects financed in Piaui. However, in the majority of&#13;
subprojects visited, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) by the beneficiary associations was&#13;
found to be satisfactory, user fees being collected regularly and some reserve funds being&#13;
started to meet eventual expenses for extraordinary maintenance and/or capital&#13;
replacements.&#13;
4   In financial terms. Although economic prices could not be calculated for some of the inputs (e.g.,&#13;
machinery), it can be assumed, given the few distortions now remaining in the Brazilian economy,&#13;
that the economic IERR of this type of subproject would be close to its financial IERR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                          Annex B&#13;
19.  -By improving the quality of life and economic and social conditions of beneficiaries,&#13;
the NRDP has initiated a process of accumulation at both the local and household levels,&#13;
thereby ensuring a degree of sustainability that previous development efforts in the&#13;
Northeast were not able to provide. As found in the University of Michigan study (para.&#13;
5(c)), socio-economic conditions in the communities that have been reached by the program&#13;
have improved notably. In particular, NRDP-funded investments accelerated the post-1993&#13;
drought recovery of these communities, and provided them with incentives to use land more&#13;
intensively. While rural infrastructure and social subprojects have ameliorated, sometimes&#13;
dramatically, living standards of beneficiary families, they also have, along with productive&#13;
subprojects, generated employment not only for heads of rural households but also other&#13;
members including women, and led to improved welfare and increased, more stable, family&#13;
incomes. As a result, the program has contributed to elevating the economic conditions of&#13;
beneficiaries above those generally found with rural communities in the Northeast,&#13;
providing them with initial start-up funds and allowing them to start generating savings both&#13;
for financing their own investments and eventually accessing formal credit. In addition, a&#13;
notable feature of the NRDP has been to encourage resource mobilization at the municipal&#13;
level, as demonstrated by the increasing financial participation of municipalities in the&#13;
program (para. 11).&#13;
20.   Given the relatively high IERRs of some productive subprojects, it could be argued&#13;
that these cases would be better attended through credit rather than through a grant&#13;
mechanism. However, the rural poor in the Northeast --the target group of the&#13;
reformulated NRDP-- generally have limited access to credit for such micro-ventures. As&#13;
an alternative to credit, the grant mechanism provides the NRDP beneficiary communities&#13;
with the means to accumulate benefits at the local level and generate savings, which they&#13;
could use to leverage with the financial sector to obtain credit for investments and&#13;
eventually graduate out of the program. However, determination of the critical variables&#13;
which would be applied to decide when a given community or municipality should graduate&#13;
from the program requires careful study.&#13;
ADVANTAGES OF FUMAC OVER PAC&#13;
21.   While the pilot nature of FUMAC under the reformulated NRDP necessarily limited&#13;
its area of intervention, experience to date demonstrates that this component has been&#13;
successful and should be expanded. First, as seen in para. 9, the data collected on&#13;
subprojects implemented under the program show that FUMAC has outperformed PAC in&#13;
terms of number of beneficiaries per subproject and costs per beneficiary.&#13;
22.   Second, the FUMAC approach has clearly achieved greater community participation&#13;
and transparency than PAC and has helped strengthen the capacity of communities to select&#13;
and implement subprojects. While socio-economic benefits produced by the two&#13;
components are similar in many respects, there is enough evidence, as found in Kottak and&#13;
Costa's follow-up study (1994), to assert that greater community participation and&#13;
transparency in decision-making have been achieved through FUMAC, since subproject&#13;
proposals are deliberated not only by the community but also by the project Municipal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                           Annex B&#13;
Council at open public meetings. Not only does awareness of the program and its&#13;
requirements appear to be stronger with FUMAC communities than with PAC communities,&#13;
but participation in decision-making has also been found to be higher with the first group.&#13;
Generally, as a result of better selection and prioritization by the beneficiaries through the&#13;
Municipal Council forum, FUMAC subprojects are able to meet the program's criteria&#13;
better than PAC subprojects. This more rigorous process in FUMAC also contributes to an&#13;
increased capacity by communities in FUMAC municipalities to identify, plan and&#13;
implement subprojects. In addition, the stronger and more capable Municipal Councils&#13;
served as catalysts to increase community organization.&#13;
23.   Third, local governments and communities are committed to the FUMAC approach.&#13;
The success of FUMAC can be gauged by the large degree of acceptance and commitment&#13;
of both local governments and communities, which have, in most states, adhered to its&#13;
principles of consensus building and local development planning, albeit in embryonic form.&#13;
This has translated, as in Maranhao and Paraiba, into the establishment in PAC&#13;
municipalities of"FUMAC-like" Councils, where local priorities are discussed and&#13;
collective decisions are made on subproject submissions to be forwarded to the TUs.&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT OF SUBPROJECTS&#13;
24.   NRDP investments are generally of good quality. In most PAC and FUMAC&#13;
subprojects executed in the ten states, a technical evaluation carried out by the Bank in late&#13;
1994 found that works were generally of good quality, particularly when implemented by&#13;
private contractors (75% of subprojects). With the remaining 25% of subprojects (20%&#13;
executed by municipalities, with unskilled labor often provided by beneficiaries, and 5%&#13;
implemented by the communities themselves), the quality varied but remained generally fair&#13;
to good. Only for a very small proportion (less than 5% of all subprojects) was&#13;
construction quality rated as poor.&#13;
25.   However, some shortcomings have been detected in a number of subprojects, namely&#13;
the overdesign of works due to lack of technical criteria and/or competent technical assistance,&#13;
and leading to discrepancies in investment size and costs per beneficiary for the same type of&#13;
projects. In addition, technical assistance provided by TUs or other entities to communities in&#13;
planning and executing projects, has sometimes been found to be inadequate. Despite the&#13;
availability of funds under NRDP to hire professional assistance with planning or&#13;
implementation, such assistance is hard to secure in rural areas-in part because under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP the cost of technical assistance for preparation and implementation of a&#13;
subproject is included in its cost estimate and funds cannot be released to remunerate contracted&#13;
professionals if the association's proposal has been rejected.&#13;
26.   Because of their relatively small size, PAC/FUMAC subprojects generally do not&#13;
produce significant effects on the environment. However, certain types of projects, by their&#13;
very nature, produce environmentally undesirable by-products (e.g., from the processing of&#13;
manioc) or lead to increased use of products that may have a negative environmental impact&#13;
(fertilizers and pesticides associated with the use of tractors, wood for fuel in cassava and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55 -                           Annex B&#13;
rice mills, etc.). Additional consideration would have to be given to these aspects under&#13;
follow-up projects.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
27.   Institutional analysis of the reformulated NRDP as it is implemented in the ten&#13;
states, and of the role played by the various actors in the program, yields a generally&#13;
favorable picture.&#13;
28.   Once mobilized and legally established, community associations generally function&#13;
well, apart from some cases of apathy or of takeover by individuals trying to monopolize&#13;
benefits. Collective responsibilities such as appointment of office-holders, payment of dues&#13;
or user fees and accounting are generally met by the members, particularly of those&#13;
associations which are well organized, as in Minas Gerais where many date back to the start&#13;
of the original NRDP. Some community associations are newly-formed, having been&#13;
mobilized with the objective of requesting financing for a needed subproject, and do not&#13;
have significant organizational experience at the outset. While the potential for political&#13;
influence exists in the organization of these community associations, the outcome is&#13;
generally favorable as these mayors facilitate the spread of information about the project&#13;
and provide the conditions necessary for communities to capitalize on project benefits which&#13;
meet their basic needs. In all ten states, community associations share a common need for&#13;
technical assistance. Not only is this essential for the organizational development of newly-&#13;
formed associations, but it is needed to assist all associations during the whole subproject&#13;
cycle, from preparation to implementation and O&amp;M of subprojects. While training and&#13;
technical assistance is a critical input for all subprojects, the need for assistance is more&#13;
acute for productive subprojects where inadequate O&amp;M is often the result of lack of&#13;
technical know-how on the part of the communities in the absence of follow-up by the TUs.&#13;
Better access to organizational and management training will also contribute to the&#13;
sustainability of both community organizations and subprojects.&#13;
29.   The FUMAC Municipal Councils are the focal point of the project's decentralization&#13;
strategy and must be protected from political interference which would undermine the&#13;
demand-driven nature of the project. In FUMAC, the Municipal Councils review and&#13;
discuss in a public forum the communities' subproject requests and forward these to the TU&#13;
in priority order for financing. The Councils are generally chaired by the mayors and&#13;
comprise representatives from both public and non-governmental agencies and community&#13;
associations. Development and performance of the project FUMAC Municipal Councils are&#13;
affected by the attitude of the local political power base, especially that of the mayor.&#13;
Usually, mayors are supportive and the disparate interests represented in the FUMAC&#13;
councils have found a modus vivendi. For instance, mayors of the municipality of Afogados&#13;
de Ingazeira in Pernambuco or that of Tibau do Sul in Rio Grande do Norte are working&#13;
hand in hand with their respective FUMAC Municipal Councils and the community&#13;
subprojects that have been financed are performing very satisfactorily. In fact, mayors in&#13;
some states have adopted the FUMAC approach and applied it to decision-making on&#13;
allocation of non-project resources as well. On the other hand, in Pernambuco in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                          Annex B&#13;
municipality of Brejo da Madre de Deus, a rural water supply subproject financed for the&#13;
community of Sitio Calderao in late 1993, was never discussed within the FUMAC&#13;
Municipal Council, and the mayor has attempted to undermine the Council's autonomy.&#13;
Similarly, in Piaui in the municipality of Jose de Freitas, the FUMAC Council was not&#13;
involved in the selection and implementation of two subprojects-electrification and small-&#13;
scale irrigation-approved for the community of Ema, neither of which has become fully&#13;
operational. Therefore, while political influence can work to the advantage of the Councils&#13;
by facilitating the subproject approval process and forging mutual benefits for project&#13;
Councils and municipal governments, this same influence can undermine the demand-driven&#13;
nature of the project if left unchecked.&#13;
30.   The participation and support of rural municipal governments is important for&#13;
sustainability and should be encouraged, but with sufficient safeguards against negative&#13;
political influence. While the project Municipal Councils act independently of municipal&#13;
governments, the participation and support of the latter is nonetheless important. Rural&#13;
municipal governments have limited financial resources with which to invest in rural&#13;
communities and, hence, the reformulated NRDP has served as an important source of&#13;
funds at the local level to bridge the gap in public resources for investment in poor rural&#13;
communities. Experience under the reformulated NRDP has demonstrated that the mayors&#13;
and municipal leaders view the project as a welcome source of additional resources for&#13;
investment to meet basic community needs to which their municipal budgets cannot&#13;
realistically attend. For the most part, mayors, municipal legislature members (vereadores)&#13;
and municipal administrations have supported and participated in NRDP; in some states,&#13;
such as Piaui and Paraiba, the municipal governments have even provided the counterpart&#13;
funds which the financially strapped state governments were unable to supply. At times,&#13;
however, mayors or legislators have attempted to subvert the program to their own ends.&#13;
For example, in the municipality of Agua Branca in Piaui, a local politician has promoted&#13;
subprojects for different communities to improve his own local standing and attract&#13;
supporters; and in the municipality of Carnaiba in Pernambuco, a tractor subproject&#13;
approved for a community ended up being used by the prefeitura and not the community.&#13;
Cases such as the latter, where political manipulation directly penalized the communities&#13;
through unrealized subproject benefits, are rare. The former case, where communities&#13;
benefit from subprojects despite political influence, is much more common. Moreover,&#13;
where local political leadership openly opposed the FUMAC approach, the PAC component&#13;
allowed the community associations to bypass the municipal authorities and submit&#13;
proposals directly to the state TUs.&#13;
31.   Technical Units need assistance to streamline operational procedures and strengthen&#13;
project supervision. The TU is the focal point for project administration and is the project's&#13;
principal liaison for the Municipal Councils and for those community associations located in&#13;
PAC municipalities. The TUs are located within the Planning Secretariat of each state, with&#13;
the exception of Rio Grande do Norte where the TU falls under the responsibility of the&#13;
State Secretariat of Labor and Social Action (SETAS). Most have established several field&#13;
offices, each with one or more technicians. In some cases TUs also handle other&#13;
development programs in the state, but usually these are programs of minor importance.&#13;
That the TUs have generally been successful in promoting NRDP is obvious from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                           Annex B&#13;
overwhelming community response. However, despite their size (generally 40-60&#13;
technicians), TUs find it hard to process the large number of subproject proposals and to&#13;
provide technical assistance for the preparation and implementation of subprojects.&#13;
Because the process of appraising subprojects and, in particular, that of negotiating terms of&#13;
agreement with beneficiary associations is time-consuming, not all of the approximately&#13;
10,000 subprojects approved yearly are actually funded the same year. In addition,&#13;
supervision of subprojects is weak given the logistical constraints of visiting a large number&#13;
of subprojects. Project technical assistance is provided to the TUs and is mostly contracted&#13;
from international agencies, such as the Instituto Interamericano de CooperaVao para a&#13;
Agricultura (IICA) and FAO.&#13;
32.   The successful cases of NGOs and other technical assistance providers participating&#13;
in the reformulated NRDP need to be replicated. One solution to the problem of the TUs'&#13;
inability to provide sufficient technical assistance and to supervise the large number of&#13;
subprojects, has been for the TUs to forge alliances with NGOs to provide technical support&#13;
to communities and monitoring services, as has been done successfully in Rio Grande do&#13;
Norte with FETARN (Federafao Estadual dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura do Rio&#13;
Grande do Norte), AACC and other local NGOs, or to forge alliances with other technical&#13;
assistance providers as in Minas Gerais. In this latter state, for instance, EMATER provides&#13;
high quality agricultural extension services and has been more supportive and successful&#13;
than in other states in contributing to income-generating productive subprojects. However,&#13;
even where there is no official alliance between the TU and EMATER, individual&#13;
extensionists may still support NRDP adpersonam. In general, NGOs have played a mixed&#13;
role. In certain states, churches, rural labor unions and some of the more technical NGOs are&#13;
playing a useful part in the implementation of subprojects-stimulating and helping with the&#13;
initial formation of community associations or providing assistance with submission or execution&#13;
of community proposals. This has been the case, in particular, of Rio Grande do Norte where&#13;
NGOs, grouped together under the Forum do Campo, have participated actively in the project.&#13;
In other states, some of the NGOs contacted through initial publicity campaigns were unsuited&#13;
or unwilling to become involved in the reformulated NRDP, while others would only participate&#13;
if project funds were channeled through them.&#13;
33.   The World Bank Recife Office is fundamental to the implementation and supervision&#13;
of the reformulated NRDP. The World Bank's office in Recife (Pernambuco) has three task&#13;
managers dedicated exclusively to working with the ten states under the project. By&#13;
delegating all supervision activities to the Recife Office, including procurement reviews and&#13;
field visits, World Bank support is better tailored to the decentralized structure of the&#13;
reformulated NRDP.&#13;
34.   Institutional analysis shows that, by assigning greater responsibility and influence to&#13;
local level organizations and municipal government, the reformulated NRDP's primary&#13;
achievement has been to support a decentralized approach to resource allocation in the rural&#13;
areas of the Northeast. Even at this early stage in the implementation of the approach&#13;
adopted by the reformulated NRDP, it is possible to draw certain conclusions about its&#13;
institutional arrangements and performance. The capacity of both communities and&#13;
municipal governments to prioritize investment decisions is strengthened by the program's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -                          Annex B&#13;
subproject development and approval process. The program has provided a fiscal incentive&#13;
to decentralized decision-making, since local level decisions are backed by inflows of&#13;
project resources. The FUMAC approach, in particular, has not only placed the power to&#13;
prioritize community investment proposals with local-level organizations, but has also&#13;
introduced transparency into the resource allocation process for rural investments at the&#13;
municipal level, thereby minimizing the traditional clientelistic approach. FUMAC provides&#13;
a forum, which did not exist before, for local government representatives and community&#13;
representatives to discuss investment needs and priorities. As FUMAC spreads beyond its&#13;
current pilot phase and as municipalities gain more years of experience with the mechanism,&#13;
municipal governments will become more accustomed to participatory decision-making&#13;
processes, and rural community associations will continue to exercise their voice.&#13;
35.   The reformulated NRDP is nonetheless vulnerable to political interference,&#13;
particularly where local level organizations such as community associations and FUMAC&#13;
Municipal Councils are newly formed, lacking sufficient information, or without adequate&#13;
technical assistance and training, which need to be addressed in follow-up projects.&#13;
Experience under the reformulated NRDP demonstrates that there is a fine line between&#13;
participation of local political leaders in the program, which is strongly encouraged, and&#13;
politicization of the program. Politicization occurs when transparency breaks down, which&#13;
can happen if information about the project is not widely and carefully disseminated, or&#13;
when project internal controls are not enforced, such as with weak supervision by the TUs&#13;
or insufficient external support from NGOs or other third parties to monitor project&#13;
implementation. As municipalities increase their contributions to the financing of NRDP&#13;
investments, greater vigilance will be required to ensure that the demand-driven nature of&#13;
the project is not sacrificed. Also, the FUMAC approach which instills greater transparency&#13;
into the program's resource allocation process can fall prey to political interference if&#13;
community representation on the Councils is insufficient. In addition, where technical&#13;
assistance and training is inadequate, sustainability of the investments is more precarious&#13;
since operation and maintenance of the investments requires certain skill sets which may not&#13;
exist in some communities. Increased "on the job" training to community associations is&#13;
vital to ensure their sustainability, particularly of newly-formed associations.&#13;
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
36.   The generally satisfactory performance of the reformulated NRDP and its favorable&#13;
impact on the lives and incomes of beneficiaries show that after several years of experience&#13;
with rural development efforts in the Northeast, a good measure of success has been&#13;
achieved in effectively reaching the rural poor with targeted interventions. Some of the&#13;
most positive results can be summarized as follows:&#13;
* The reformulated NRDP has put in place objective conditions for the organization&#13;
of poor communities in the ten participating states. In some of these states,&#13;
organized rural communities have shown that they can influence the allocation and&#13;
use of municipal financial resources in such a way as to favor the rural poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -                           Annex B&#13;
*  The program has fostered the institutional and financial commitment of local&#13;
governments to its decentralized approach of addressing the needs of the rural poor.&#13;
A large number of municipalities, although not legally required either under PAC or&#13;
FUMAC, have provided financial and other types of assistance to approved&#13;
community projects. In addition, in some states, mayors have adopted the FUMAC&#13;
approach and instituted it for decision-making on non-project investments at the&#13;
municipal level.&#13;
*  Investments funded by the program have, to a large extent, (i) satisfied real&#13;
community needs; (ii) been of good or satisfactory quality and (iii) been relatively&#13;
less costly than those executed by public authorities (municipal, state and federal).&#13;
*  Beneficiary communities have adhered enthusiastically to the program; such&#13;
enthusiasm has translated into participation in the execution and in contributing to&#13;
the costs of operation and maintenance of the investments, enhancing their sense of&#13;
ownership of the subprojects.&#13;
*  Although the reformulated program does not incorporate instruments for structural&#13;
changes in the agriculture of the Northeast, it has proven to be a valuable approach&#13;
for reaching and assisting a large number of landless families--usually excluded&#13;
from the target groups of many other programs, including the original NRDP.&#13;
Further, land reform beneficiaries have become a very active clientele of the&#13;
reformulated program, as it provides them with opportunities to satisfy investment&#13;
needs other than those received through the government's land reform program.&#13;
e In the majority of FIJMAC participating municipalities, there are encouraging signs&#13;
that the "clientelistic" approach traditionally used in the Northeast to satisfy&#13;
community needs is gradually giving way to a more genuinely participatory and&#13;
transparent approach. This transparency in decision-making has allowed a built-in&#13;
mechanism of "social control" over investments made with public funds.&#13;
37.   Nevertheless, the program could be further improved by introducing modifications&#13;
to its design, which would rectify those deficiencies that have been identified and would&#13;
improve project implementation and performance. In the case of Piaui, some serious flaws&#13;
in NRDP performance in the state were detected by the Bank and FAO when it was first&#13;
evaluated at the end of 1995: institutional problems, compounded by personal conflicts&#13;
between the TU and the State Secretariat of Planning; local political interference and poor&#13;
beneficiary participation, although political abuses were often linked to the fact that, in the&#13;
absence of state counterpart funds, municipalities financially contributed to the project;&#13;
insufficient technical assistance and lack of field supervision -- weaknesses that were found&#13;
in other states as well; and occasional cases of subproject overdesign and mistargeting.&#13;
This negative assessment prompted the Bank to recommend to the State Government to&#13;
adopt specific measures to improve project performance, contained in a Plano Emergencial&#13;
de Trabalho which was put in effect by the TU in October 1995. Progress under this&#13;
"emergency plan", closely monitored in the past few months by the Bank, has been found to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                          Annex B&#13;
be satisfactory. In particular, during the second evaluation of NRDP-Piaui, carried out by&#13;
the Bank in May 1996, substantial improvements were noted. At the central level,&#13;
institutional problems have been eased by the nomination of new, more competent TU Chief&#13;
and Secretary of Planning. In the field, the situation is now also considerably better, helped&#13;
by the active participation of EMATER and the Church in providing technical assistance to&#13;
project beneficiaries, laid down under recent agreements with the State TU. Subproject&#13;
appraisal and monitoring has been undertaken by the TU following more rigorous&#13;
guidelines. Political manipulation and other abuses have been actively pursued through&#13;
judicial action. As a result, of the 40 subprojects visited this time, only a minority of&#13;
subprojects displayed operational and/or organizational problems. Based on these&#13;
encouraging results, the state has committed itself to continue in this path under the&#13;
proposed follow-up project.&#13;
38.   Proposed modifications to the design of follow-up projects to the NRDP stemming&#13;
from these lessons, and others derived from the evaluations of the program, are as follows:&#13;
39.   Expand FUMAC. The projects should expand FUMAC and initiate a pilot&#13;
municipal funds program (FUMAC-P), to promote further decentralization of decision-&#13;
making to municipal and community levels, to relieve the administrative logjam resulting&#13;
from state intervention in the minutiae of subprojects, and to further encourage municipal&#13;
cost-sharing of subprojects. The appraisal and subsequent approval of community&#13;
subprojects by Municipal Councils under FUMAC and FUMAC-P would significantly&#13;
reduce the role played by TUs in approving subprojects-and the bias that this implies-in&#13;
the existing program. Also, FUMAC tends to be more effective in thwarting political&#13;
interference because of the increased transparency of its subproject approval process over&#13;
that of PAC. Increasing community representation on the Councils to at least 80% of all&#13;
voting members will help Councils resist overpowering political influence.&#13;
40.   Supervision. By the same token, supervision of subprojects by the TUs should be&#13;
more rigorous, including by contracting external assistance as in Rio Grande do Norte&#13;
where FETARN was contracted for this purpose. Supervision, both during and after&#13;
implementation of the subprojects, is an indispensable determinant of their success and&#13;
sustainability. Increased superision would improve the quality of implementation of&#13;
subprojects and would help identify and resolve potential problems in subproject operation&#13;
and subsequent maintenance.&#13;
41.   Standard Designs and Appraisal Criteria. For simplicity and efficiency in&#13;
subproject preparation, evaluation and supervision, as well as for minimizing design&#13;
deficiencies, the Project Operational Manuals should establish standard engineering designs,&#13;
technical and financial parameters, and cost indicators for the most frequently requested&#13;
subprojects. Standardization of subproject documents, technical designs and unit costs simplifies&#13;
the subproject preparation and evaluation process, facilitates the procurement of goods and&#13;
works, prevents overdesign and improves the quality of subprojects, encouraging greater&#13;
participation by poorer communities and reducing bottlenecks in the subproject cycle. Also,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                            Annex B&#13;
environmental assessment criteria should be part of the Operational Manual and routinely&#13;
monitored during subproject supervision.&#13;
42.   Technical Assistance and Training. Funds for technical assistance and training&#13;
should be channeled to rural communities and project Municipal Councils to enable&#13;
participation of the poorest areas, foster community capacity and empowennent, and&#13;
encourage the active participation of able and competent NGOs and local development&#13;
agencies. Increased technical assistance to rural communities also will enable them to identify,&#13;
prepare and implement their own subprojects, thereby augmenting their capacity to compete for&#13;
investment funds and to operate and maintain the subprojects appropriately. In addition,&#13;
technical assistance activities should be targeted to project Municipal Councils to improve their&#13;
planning, management and financial capacity. Finally, the quality and capacity of the Technical&#13;
Unit is a critical factor in project success, and thus its institutional strengthening, which may&#13;
entail the contracting of intemational or bilateral aid-funded entities such as IICA or GTZ, as is&#13;
currently practiced, should receive increased attention. The TUs should actively organize all&#13;
technical assistance and training arrangements under the project and oversee the quality of&#13;
said activities.&#13;
43.   Participation and Transparency. In addition to the above measures, participation&#13;
and transparency should be further enhanced by setting clear rules for the composition and&#13;
modus operandi of project Municipal Councils, with more than 80% of members coming&#13;
from community representatives and the local civil society. In addition, greater efforts by&#13;
the TU to organize and mobilize poor communities are fundamental in order to enable these&#13;
communities to participate in the benefits of the project.&#13;
44.   Transparency also should be promoted by incorporating a system of operational&#13;
incentives and penalties into the project design. Incentives for positive performance and&#13;
penalties against departures from project guidelines --misappropriation of resources,&#13;
mistargeting of project benefits, faulty subproject design, insufficient community&#13;
participation or lack of proper O&amp;M-- should accompany the increased decentralization of&#13;
resources and decision-making responsibilities to beneficiaries and project Municipal&#13;
Councils through FUMAC and FUMAC-P. This framework of incentives and disincentives&#13;
would require backing by the TUs through ex-post control of subproject activities through&#13;
auditing of accounts, and supervision and monitoring.&#13;
45.   Finally, to minimize the risk of political manipulation and increase participation, the&#13;
ten states must better tailor their information campaigns to the rural poor and ensure that&#13;
information about the project, particularly its objectives, operational guidelines and&#13;
procedures for soliciting financing, is widely disseminated to all potential beneficiaries.&#13;
Better and more widely disseminated information campaigns will also increase transparency&#13;
--stimulating the role of public "watchdogs"-- and will put all communities on a level&#13;
playing field with respect to access to project benefits.&#13;
46.   Sustainability. Through a system of matching grants to poor rural community&#13;
associations, the reformulated NRDP is improving the quality of life and the economic and social&#13;
conditions of its beneficiaries. By providing an initial jump-start to poor communities previously&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62 -                            Annex B&#13;
without investment capital, the reformulated NRDP has initiated a process of local accumulation&#13;
at the beneficiary and community levels and laid the groundwork for sustainable local&#13;
development. This sustainable local development will be further encouraged through greater&#13;
financial participation of municipal governments in subproject investments, a process already&#13;
underway in the ongoing projects but which should be expanded. Sustainability of the&#13;
subproject investments themselves also has greater potential when the municipalities and&#13;
communities contribute to the subproject financing in a cost-sharing arrangement and when there&#13;
is increased beneficiary participation. Beneficiary counterpart contributions should be better&#13;
quantified and should count toward the global counterpart fund requirements. Furthermore,&#13;
increased technical assistance and training to rural communities as well as stronger&#13;
supervision by the TUs will improve the quality of implementation of subprojects and stem&#13;
potential problems in subproject operation and maintenance, which can impede&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
47.   Cost Sharing and Graduation. A strategy should be formalized to graduate&#13;
municipalities and communities from the program, once a certain level of accumulated&#13;
benefits has been reached. A fundamental element of a feasible graduation strategy would&#13;
be the criteria adopted to determine the point of graduation, backed by appropriate data&#13;
which can be collected to implement such a strategy. The strategy would need to carefully&#13;
consider beneficiaries' access to credit as well as monitorable indicators of income levels&#13;
and local capacity to manage funds, as would be demonstrated through mastery of the&#13;
FUMAC-P approach.&#13;
48.   Monitoring and Evaluation. A user-friendly monitoring and evaluation system&#13;
facilitates the subproject evaluation process, provides feedback and necessary information to&#13;
improve targeting and efficiency, and serves as an effective management and planning tool. To&#13;
bolster the measurement of overall project impact, the monitoring and evaluation system would&#13;
need to expand the range of project impact indicators and performance benchmarks. Examples&#13;
include: increased employment for women; improved health and related "savings" to&#13;
State/municipal budgets; resource mobilization at the local/municipal level; and indicators of&#13;
migration. In addition, as mentioned above, the project monitoring and evaluation system must&#13;
be geared to collect the information necessary to support a graduation strategy. Therefore, as a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness, the monitoring and evaluation system of the projects should&#13;
be improved to reinforce the mechanisms for targeting and to secure reliable data for&#13;
evaluating subproject impact, as well as to facilitate better control and project management&#13;
throughout the subproject cycle by the TUs.&#13;
49.   "Best Practice" Exchanges. Across the ten states of the reformulated NRDP,&#13;
there exist numerous successful interventions that could be replicated to the benefit of the&#13;
whole program, such as the experience with EMATER in Minas Gerais or with NGOs in&#13;
Rio Grande do Norte. In addition, certain states have adopted technical parameters or have&#13;
developed training materials which have produced positive results and should be&#13;
disseminated throughout the program. Thus, "best practice" exchanges should be arranged&#13;
among the TUs to share successful experiences and to reward innovation. More&#13;
importantly, at the state level, community associations with successful subprojects or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 63 -                           Annex B&#13;
possessing certain skills should also be encouraged to share these with other associations&#13;
through training seminars and workshops.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PIAUI&#13;
C. TARGETING MECHANISMS AND PROJECT&#13;
MUNICIPALITIES&#13;
1.    Targeting of the rural poor is of critical importance in the project particularly as&#13;
justification for the use of grants for subproject financing. Under the project, it is&#13;
proposed that targeting occur at three levels:&#13;
(a)   geographically by poverty level and other characteristics of the&#13;
municipalities;&#13;
(b)   geographically within municipalities to target rural settlements and&#13;
communities; and,&#13;
(c)   community-based selection of poor beneficiaries and particularly&#13;
vulnerable groups by the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
2.    Municipalities. Targeting at the first and second levels defines the project area.&#13;
All municipalities, with the exception of the state capital, Teresina, are included in the&#13;
project area, which brings the total project municipalities to 217 (including the 70 new&#13;
municipalities to be created as of January 1, 1997, through the subdivision of existing&#13;
ones). Targeting of these municipalities takes into consideration the concentration of&#13;
income and economic activity in the state capital and the higher incidence of poverty in the&#13;
municipalities of the interior, manifested by such indicators as the rate of indigence',&#13;
availability of municipal resources, and other socio-economic indicators (see Table).&#13;
According to IPEA (1993), 90% of the project municipalities suffer a rate of indigence&#13;
greater than 60%, and all but two municipalities have an indigence rate greater than 50%.&#13;
In addition, since rural poverty in Piaui is closely correlated with the poor natural resource&#13;
base, the harsh agro-climatic conditions and concentration of land ownership, the project&#13;
area includes the entire semi-arid region of the state (the majority of the state falls within&#13;
the "drought polygon") and includes the area currently assisted by the reformulated&#13;
NRDP, characterized as small farm areas, both in the semi-arid region and more humid&#13;
cerrados region (para. 1.17) with primarily smallholders, sharecroppers and wage&#13;
Rate of indigence equals the number of families below the official poverty line established by&#13;
IPEA divided by the total number of families in the municipality. See 0 Mapa da Fome, IPEA,&#13;
March 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -                          Annex C&#13;
workers, who depend on a diverse strategy of income-generating activities in which the&#13;
subsistence production of maize, beans, manioc and rice, and small livestock&#13;
predominates.&#13;
3.    Within the project municipalities, the selection of PAC and FUMAC municipalities&#13;
will be based on criteria such as past performance under the reformulated NRDP,&#13;
estimation of the organizational capacity of communities within the municipality, and&#13;
"progressiveness" of the mayor and municipal administration. The criteria for selection of&#13;
FUTMAC-P municipalities are included in Annex F. As an incentive and basis for a&#13;
reasonable rate of development for FUMAC and FUMAC-P Councils, about 9 --or, at the&#13;
minimum, 5-- subprojects would be financed annually for each of these Councils.&#13;
Adopting this rule and based on the average unit cost of NRDP subprojects in Piaui,&#13;
amounts initially allocated to the two subcomponents would permit the establishment of&#13;
48 FUMAC Councils and 5 FUMAC-P Councils during the project period. As project&#13;
implementation proceeds and PAC funds are quickly depleted for the numerous other&#13;
municipalities, no more than 10 PAC municipalities would be permitted to graduate into&#13;
FUMAC in order that each new FUMAC municipality could also benefit from a minimum&#13;
of 5 subprojects per year. Based on this arrangement, the total number of FUMAC&#13;
Councils would therefore be a maximum of 58.&#13;
4.    Rural Settlements and Communities. The second level of targeting, that within&#13;
municipalities, focuses on rural settlements and communities. Beneficiary settlements or&#13;
communities are limited to those with a population under 7,500 people.&#13;
5 .    Community-based Selection. The third and principal level of targeting is&#13;
community-based selection. The project assumes that local communities can best judge&#13;
which community groups are poor and what investment priorities are in each municipality&#13;
and/or each community. The process of consensus-building at the local level by project&#13;
Municipal Councils helps to ensure that only poor communities benefit from the project.&#13;
During the open meetings to set priorities, criteria such as the socio-economic situation of&#13;
the participating communities, including existing infrastructure and availability of services,&#13;
would be discussed as part of the ranking of subprojects within the municipality. The&#13;
composition of the Municipal Councils, in which 80% are representatives from rural&#13;
communities and local civil society, as well as the clear and transparent rules and&#13;
procedures for the Councils' functioning, are important elements which facilitate targeting&#13;
poor beneficiaries. Finally, indicative targets set for social subprojects and those which&#13;
benefit women in particular, should be considered by the Municipal Councils as criteria for&#13;
subproject selection, insofar as the principles of need and perceived benefits guide ranking&#13;
decisions.&#13;
6.    The effectiveness of the targeting methodology would be assessed through the&#13;
project monitoring system and though ex-post evaluation studies. For example, annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                          Annex C&#13;
physical performance reviews (Annex H) would monitor the targeting of project benefits.&#13;
Also, the project implementation review (Annex H) would measure the ability of the&#13;
project to target and reach the poor. Adjustments and fine-tuning of the targeting&#13;
methodology would be based on these ex-post reviews, in agreement with the Bank.&#13;
GRADUATION STRATEGY&#13;
7.    The demand-driven community development model presented in the proposed&#13;
project is expected to increase the income-generating capacity and standards of living in&#13;
the beneficiary communities. Because project resources will be targeted to the poorest&#13;
rural communities, certain communities with better socio-economic standing relative to&#13;
others would receive fewer investment resources during the course of project&#13;
implementation. These communities, able to leverage a critical mass of subprojects and&#13;
other benefits from this and previous Bank-financed and other projects, would gain access&#13;
to other sources of financing and reach a point where a "safety net" is no longer necessary.&#13;
In order to formalize this process, the proposed project would introduce a community&#13;
graduation strategy whereby those communities with demonstrated capacity for&#13;
sustainable asset-accumulation (savings), adequate social and economic infrastructure and&#13;
community organization, would no longer be eligible for project matching grants.&#13;
To make this judgment, baseline profiles of beneficiary communities would be&#13;
developed using indicators of community well-being collected from community subproject&#13;
proposals. Each subproject proposal would be accompanied by a 'fact sheet' to be filled&#13;
out by the community which would provide indication of the community's socio-economic&#13;
standing. The questions asked would extract information on benefits from previous&#13;
subprojects as well as from NRDP and other public programs, existing infrastructure and&#13;
access to social services, and indicators of accumulation/savings, such as: (a) the average&#13;
income of families in the community, in terms of minimum wages; (b) the average portion&#13;
of this income which families dedicate to buy food; (c) the average portion of family&#13;
income dedicated to buying medicines; and (d) the percentage of community households&#13;
which have electricity, which have secure access to water and/or treated water, and which&#13;
have access to a health post. The information contained in the baseline community profiles&#13;
would be incorporated in the MIS, and regularly updated through monitoring and&#13;
supervision exercises.&#13;
At the end of the second year, the project would finance a study to determine the&#13;
point at which a community would be charged a higher cost-sharing percentage as well as&#13;
the "take-off' point, the point at which a community would graduate out of the project.&#13;
The study would be based on a comparison of community profiles and on information&#13;
from the baseline impact evaluation (see Annex H). Using this analysis, the PCU (for&#13;
PAC) and the Municipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P), with the support of the&#13;
PCU, would graduate those communities which have reached this "take-off' point. As&#13;
communities graduate, those municipalities with fewer eligible communities would&#13;
gradually receive less funding for subprojects and, concurrently, would graduate from the&#13;
project as well.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PIAUI&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1.    The success of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Project in Piaui in meeting its stated&#13;
objectives depends primarily on the strength of four organizations: (a) community&#13;
organizations; (b) Municipal Councils; (c) the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU); and (d)&#13;
participating governmental and non-governmental agencies.&#13;
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
2.    Community associations are the legitimate representatives of the beneficiaries&#13;
before the Municipal Councils and the State under the project, and the project will only&#13;
benefit those communities organized into legally-constituted civil associations. This&#13;
prerequisite helps ensure that the project meets the needs of a representative group from a&#13;
given community and not simply the needs of its more vocal or politically influential&#13;
constituents. Due to the rather cumbersome legal process in Brazil for forming&#13;
associations, the project only requires that the association be legally constituted once the&#13;
subproject proposal has been approved.&#13;
3.    Under Brazilian law, the leadership of community associations consists of the&#13;
Executive Board of Directors, the General Assembly and the Fiscal Council. The&#13;
Executive Board of Directors comprises the President, Secretary, and Treasurer and the&#13;
Coordinators of any special working groups within the Association. These fixed-term&#13;
positions are filled by the vote of the General Assembly which meets regularly every three&#13;
months to discuss and vote on the Association's work program and internal procedures.&#13;
All decisions made by the General Assembly are registered in official documents (atas)&#13;
and signed by all members present. This procedure is reflected in the identification and&#13;
prioritization of subprojects: a subproject proposal addresses the needs of a majority of&#13;
the association, as voted by its members, and therefore is accompanied by an ata signed by&#13;
the association members. The fiscal council, normally composed of three members,&#13;
supervises all of the association's activities and functions as internal auditor of all financial&#13;
transactions made by the association. The principal source of resources for most&#13;
associations is the monthly dues paid by their members.&#13;
4.    Community associations are the foundation of project implementation. The&#13;
associations are responsible for formulating ideas for subprojects and submitting these&#13;
proposals to the Municipal Councils or PCU for financing. The General Assembly&#13;
deliberates and votes on each subproject proposal thereby ensuring that these subprojects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                    Annex D&#13;
attend to the needs of the majority of the association members. The signed ata which&#13;
accompanies each subproject proposal attests to the association's commitment to the&#13;
subproject. Once a subproject has been approved, the community association enters into a&#13;
legally binding agreement with the PCU and/or Municipal Council through which the&#13;
funds to implement the subproject are passed to the association. The association, in most&#13;
cases, is responsible for all procurement and record-keeping during the implementation of&#13;
the subproject. This agreement also binds the association to provide the necessary&#13;
counterpart contribution to implement the subproject (which can include labor, materials&#13;
or cash) and the future operation and maintenance of the subproject, which in the case of&#13;
certain infrastructure projects the association can transfer to appropriate public sector&#13;
agencies (e.g., the electricity company, for rural electrification subprojects).&#13;
5.    Implementation of subprojects therefore implies significant responsibility for the&#13;
community associations and the communities which they represent, and is a source of&#13;
empowerment for them. Charging the communities with the primary responsibility for the&#13;
implementation of their own subprojects assures better quality and reinforces their sense of&#13;
ownership. The supervision and administration of the subprojects is carried out by an&#13;
elected Supervision and Control Committee, which oversees the subproject from start to&#13;
finish and reports back to the association on progress. This Committee of 3 to 4 persons&#13;
is comprised of subproject beneficiaries, both members of the association and non-&#13;
members within the community. The members of the Committee are elected by the&#13;
beneficiaries-at-large and are recognized as having some experience or knowledge in the&#13;
area of the proposed subproject. The Committee visits the subproject regularly and&#13;
monitors subproject implementation, costs, procurement, and community contribution, as&#13;
well as any potential problems. The Supervision and Control Committee therefore acts as&#13;
a "community watchdog" to ensure that subproject funds and the community's&#13;
contribution are invested in accordance with the subproject agreement and that the&#13;
investment is of a high quality.&#13;
MUNICIPAL COUNCILS&#13;
6.    Under the proposed project, FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils may be&#13;
formed as legally-constituted civil organizations or may be established through Municipal&#13;
decree. In the latter case, the Council must nonetheless be granted administrative and&#13;
financial autonomy from the local municipal government. The size of the Municipal&#13;
Councils will vary across municipalities (usually between 10 and 15 members) and their&#13;
profile will be representative of the beneficiary communities. 80% of the voting power of&#13;
the Council is granted to representatives of community associations and of local civil&#13;
society, such as NGOs, labor unions and religious organizations. The remaining 20%&#13;
represent Municipal Government and other public institutions such as EMATER. The&#13;
PCU has a seat on the Council with the right to voice but not vote. Members of the&#13;
Council are elected for one-year terms by a community assembly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                    Annex D&#13;
7.    While the Municipal Councils act independently of the Municipal Government, the&#13;
participation and support of the latter is nonetheless quite important. Experience under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP has demonstrated that the mayors and municipal leadership&#13;
welcome the project Municipal Councils as an instrument to meet basic community needs&#13;
to which their municipal budgets cannot realistically attend. The participation of the&#13;
mayor is fundamental in creating a synergy between the priorities of the Council and the&#13;
Municipal Government's investment program. In this sense, the project Municipal&#13;
Council is not seen as a parallel institution to Municipal Government but as a counterpart.&#13;
8.    Municipal Councils are the key organization for the targeting of project benefits&#13;
and the allocation of resources under the proposed project. The Councils have a&#13;
fundamental role in mobilizing communities and fomenting community participation in&#13;
decision-making at the municipal level. By their nature as open, representative and&#13;
democratic bodies which build consensus on priorities, the Municipal Councils instill&#13;
transparency into the decision-making process for FUMAC and FUMAC-P investments.&#13;
The Councils receive, prioritize and approve subproject proposals from the beneficiary&#13;
associations. The monthly meetings of the Municipal Councils are widely publicized and&#13;
the public is encouraged to attend them. At these meetings, the beneficiary associations&#13;
present their subproject ideas to the Council. The Council deliberates and prioritizes the&#13;
subproject proposals based on its determination of the needs of the different communities,&#13;
and on criteria such as the level of poverty and the existing infrastructure of each&#13;
community in relation to the rest of the municipality; the type of subproject to be financed&#13;
and its potential to improve the quality of life of the beneficiary population; and the&#13;
demonstrated participation of the beneficiary community in the identification of the&#13;
subproject and its commitment to the implementation and subsequent operation and&#13;
maintenance of the subproject. The Municipal Councils' prioritization process is the basis&#13;
of targeting in the project since the communities themselves through the Councils&#13;
determine where project resources will best be applied based on their first-hand&#13;
knowledge of local investment needs. The Council ranks the subprojects in priority order&#13;
based on the vote of the Council members. The subproject approval process is based on&#13;
technical and eligibility criteria. The Municipal Council screens the FUMAC/FUMAC-P&#13;
subprojects based on pre-established technical, environmental and cost/financial standards&#13;
(see Annex G) and either approves or rejects the proposals. Rejected subprojects are&#13;
returned to the beneficiary association with recommendations to improve the proposal.&#13;
Decisions for approval or rejection of subproject proposals are also determined by vote.&#13;
Approved subprojects are either sent by FUMAC Councils to the PCU in order of priority&#13;
for financing or, in the case of FUMAC-P, financed directly by the relevant Councils.&#13;
9.    A FUMAC-P Council bases its investment decisions on an Annual Operating Plan&#13;
(POA), developed with the assistance of the PCU at the start of every fiscal year. This&#13;
POA, which is voted on by Council members after detailed deliberations, establishes the&#13;
development priorities of the municipality to be addressed with project resources. Based&#13;
on the POA, the PCU transfers the allotted budget to the Council who, on the basis of&#13;
subprojects approved, will transfer the resources to the beneficiary associations on the&#13;
basis of signed, legal agreements. This concept of approving subprojects within a budget&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                    Annex D&#13;
envelope enhances the Council's capacity to program and prioritize investments. If, on&#13;
the other hand, the Council's performance is unsatisfactory, it will run the risk of seeing its&#13;
budget envelope reduced the following year.&#13;
10.   Municipal Councils also supervise the implementation of subprojects in the&#13;
communities and work closely with the Community Control and Supervision Committee in&#13;
this respect. The Councils are well placed to provide this assistance. Given their&#13;
proximity to the communities and their lines of communication both with the PCU and&#13;
with the communities themselves, Municipal Councils are effective trouble-shooters for&#13;
subproject implementation problems.&#13;
PROJECT COORDINATING UNIT&#13;
11.   The PCU is the focal point for project administration and for communication with&#13;
the Bank and the State Government. It is also the project's principal liaison for the&#13;
Municipal Councils and for those community associations located in PAC municipalities.&#13;
In Piaui, the PCU, known under the NRDP as UT-PAPP', is an entity under the State&#13;
Secretary of Planning (SEPLAN) which has been in charge of overseeing the&#13;
implementation of NRDP and its Bank-financed predecessors since 1981 (see&#13;
Organizational Chart at the end of this annex). Under the proposed project, the PCU will&#13;
shed some of its executive responsibilities that it held under the reformulated NRDP and&#13;
increase its monitoring, technical assistance and supervision responsibilities. It will&#13;
promote decentralization and community participation in the project by delegating tasks to&#13;
Municipal Councils and participating state and non-governmental organizations.&#13;
12.   The forner UT-PAPP is undertaking a major restructuring to streamline its&#13;
organization and introduce greater flexibility, to better reflect its role coordinating project&#13;
implementation and delegating responsibilities to the local level. Under the General&#13;
Coordinator, who will oversee all aspects of project implementation and who reports to&#13;
the Secretary of Planning, the PCU will be divided in three functional areas: Planning and&#13;
Evaluation; Operations; and Administration and Finance. With a reduced staff, the PCU&#13;
will assign greater field supervision and trouble-shooting tasks to Municipal Councils or&#13;
contract them out to EMATER and NGOs. The PCU's principal tasks under the project&#13;
will include: (i) project planning and coordination at the state level through the preparation&#13;
of POAs, including the consolidation of POAs by FUMAC-P Councils, and monitoring&#13;
activities through maintenance of the project's Management Information System (MIS);&#13;
(ii) promoting the project and encouraging participation of potential beneficiary&#13;
communities, NGOs and private sector entities; (iii) preparing project implementation&#13;
reports and organizing evaluation exercises; (iv) ensuring timely and adequate provision of&#13;
loan and state counterpart funds; (v) appraising and approving all PAC subproject&#13;
proposals; (vi) entering into subproject agreements with community associations (PAC)&#13;
and Municipal Councils (FUMAC) and into POA-based agreements with FUMAC-P&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -                    Annex D&#13;
Municipal Councils, to transfer subproject funds and monitor their use; (vii) overseeing all&#13;
monitoring and supervision activities under the project to gauge compliance with project&#13;
guidelines and to improve the quality of subprojects and project interventions, ensuring&#13;
that environmental guidelines for subproject approval and implementation are followed;&#13;
(viii) providing technical assistance to the FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils;&#13;
(ix) preparing statements of expenditure (SOEs) and applications for reimbursement; and&#13;
(x) ensuring that procurement, disbursement and auditing procedures applicable to the&#13;
Bank loan are followed. To increase the PCU's capacity to undertake some of these&#13;
tasks, particularly with respect to stimulating the mobilization and organization of&#13;
communities and providing technical assistance to them, training in specific areas will be&#13;
organized for the PCU staff under the institutional development component of the project&#13;
(para. 15). In the area of environmental impact assessment, the PCU will be provided&#13;
training as well as assistance from specialized state agencies.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY&#13;
13.   The project, through the community subproject methodology, is expected to lay&#13;
the groundwork for, and consolidate, participatory institutions and processes at the&#13;
municipal and community levels. Formed into community associations, the rural&#13;
population is gaining a voice and a role in political participation which it did not have as&#13;
individuals. When communities organizes themselves to receive benefits from the project,&#13;
and then contribute to and operate and maintain the investments, this sense of ownership&#13;
of the investments empowers the communities and their organization and commitment are&#13;
being rewarded. When this level of organization is apparent at the municipal level, and the&#13;
official municipal leadership supports participatory decision-making, the municipality&#13;
enters FUMAC. The project Municipal Council in FUMAC formalizes the communities'&#13;
voice in the establishment of investment priorities at the municipal level. FUMAC also&#13;
forges a partnership between the communities and municipal leadership as both groups&#13;
contribute to the financing of investments, thus leveraging project funds. As Municipal&#13;
Councils gain experience and capacity, progressing from FUMAC to FUMAC-P, they&#13;
increase their bearing and influence on public resource programming at the municipal level&#13;
while also reinforcing a sustainable participatory process. In Serra do Mel, for example, a&#13;
highly organized municipality in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte where the&#13;
FUMAC program has operated with great success, members of the Municipal Council&#13;
declared that the participatory process engendered by FUMAC had become so ingrained&#13;
in the public decision-making process that changes in municipal administration could not&#13;
undermine it, but only support it.&#13;
14.   Implementation capacity is central to the successful performance of the community&#13;
subprojects subcomponent and, hence, of the project's development objectives. The&#13;
implementation capacity of the various institutions participating in the project --&#13;
beneficiary associations, Municipal Councils, public and non-governmental agencies, and&#13;
the PCU -- is specifically addressed by the institutional development subcomponent. This&#13;
subcomponent provides resources to finance appropriate technical assistance and training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -                     Annex D&#13;
in order that each group acquire the capabilities needed to effectively perform its functions&#13;
under the project (for operational details, see Annex E).&#13;
15.   The institutional development component will give community associations access&#13;
to funds for community mobilization and organizational strengthening. Beneficiary&#13;
associations will also have access to expertise on subproject preparation and execution, as&#13;
well as training in operation and maintenance techniques to derive optimal benefit from&#13;
subproject investments. By providing training in financial administration, the project will&#13;
also prepare these groups to manage productive activities which open doors for future&#13;
income-generating endeavors. To fully develop their potential leadership role at the&#13;
municipal level and to fulfill their role within the project, Municipal Councils will require&#13;
assistance to orient their decision-making on resource allocation among community&#13;
investments and, in the FUMAC-P program, to develop their capacity for investment&#13;
planning and financial administration. Municipal Councils will also themselves serve as a&#13;
source of technical advice for community associations. The PCU, in its refined role as&#13;
project facilitator, will require training to master effective monitoring and supervision&#13;
techniques as well as enhanced project management and other skills. Where the PCU&#13;
subcontracts its responsibilities to EMATER or to NGOs, these institutions may also&#13;
receive specific training under the project. Also, because the fiscal situation of the State&#13;
affects both project implementation and state counterpart funding, technical assistance at&#13;
the state level is needed to analyze issues surrounding the reform of the State and to&#13;
identify measures to improve the State's capacity to address the inherent causes of its&#13;
fiscal deficit situation.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PIAUI&#13;
E. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAINING AND&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY-BUILDING&#13;
1.    Technical assistance and training are fundamental inputs into the subproject cycle&#13;
and overall project implementation. Evaluations of the reformulated NRDP highlight the&#13;
importance of technical assistance and training to community associations, project&#13;
Municipal Councils and Project Coordinating Units (PCUs), in order to ensure higher&#13;
quality planning and implementation and greater sustainability of subprojects and to&#13;
augment the development impact of the project. Under the proposed Piaui Rural Poverty&#13;
Alleviation project, technical assistance would be provided in two forms: (a) the&#13;
Institutional Development component; and (b) a percentage of subproject cost targeted to&#13;
technical assistance. Details on the operational aspects for the provision of technical&#13;
assistance are included in the project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.    The Institutional Development Component. The Institutional Development&#13;
component is an important resource for the strengthening of the PCU, Municipal Councils&#13;
and community associations. This component directs technical assistance and training,&#13;
primarily community mobilization and preparation assistance, to Municipal Councils and&#13;
community associations. Since the component is not tied to the subproject cycle,&#13;
communities and Municipal Councils can receive assistance independent of whether they&#13;
have an approved subproject or approved portfolio of subprojects, respectively. The&#13;
resources of the Institutional Development component would finance a variety of&#13;
capacity-building programs, such as:&#13;
(a)   Mobilization assistance to beneficiary associations: the PCU (for PAC)&#13;
and Municipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P) would formulate&#13;
and fund strategies to extend mobilization assistance to those communities&#13;
lacking in organization and thus not initially in a position to benefit from&#13;
the project. Such assistance would include community workshops to&#13;
determine priority needs, training to community groups in organization&#13;
skills and helping them with the process of forming legal associations, etc.;&#13;
(b)   Introductory Municipal Council training program: the PCU would&#13;
organize this program which would train FUMAC Municipal Councils on&#13;
the project philosophy, subproject cycle and Operational Manual&#13;
guidelines, and FUMAC-P Councils on budgeting and administration;&#13;
(c)   Specialized skills training: the PCU, the project Councils, and groups of&#13;
community associations, would receive, on a demand basis, practical "on-&#13;
the-job training" in areas such as monitoring techniques, financial&#13;
administration, as well as specific technical topics in support of subproject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -                            Annex E&#13;
implementation and operation and maintenance (e.g., for groups of&#13;
community associations on water use);&#13;
(d)   Standard subproject design training: standardized projects will reduce the&#13;
need for intensive technical assistance in subproject preparation for the&#13;
majority of subproject types requested. The standard subproject models&#13;
are especially helpful to communities lacking experience in subproject&#13;
preparation. Workshops organized at the municipal level with Municipal&#13;
Councils and community leaders would provide technical assistance in the&#13;
use of standard subprojects,&#13;
(e)   "Best Practice" exchanges: the PCU and Municipal Councils would&#13;
finance technical exchanges among community associations with similar&#13;
subprojects. These exchanges have proven to be an effective way to&#13;
transfer know-how on subproject operation and maintenance from&#13;
community associations with successful subprojects to associations&#13;
initiating new subprojects. In addition, exchanges among Municipal&#13;
Councils within the state and among PCUs throughout the Northeast could&#13;
be financed to disseminate successful experiences across states; and&#13;
(f)    Technical assistance for State reform. Because the fiscal situation of the&#13;
State affects both project implementation and state counterpart funding,&#13;
technical assistance at the state level is needed to analyze issues&#13;
surrounding the reform of the State and to identify measures to improve&#13;
the State's capacity to overcome fiscal crisis and address its underlying&#13;
causes. The Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN), through the PCU, will&#13;
have access to technical assistance funds for consultant services and studies&#13;
required for administrative and other state reforms.&#13;
3.    For access to funds from the Institutional Development component, the PCU and&#13;
each Municipal Council would prepare, as part of the Annual Operating Plan (POA), a&#13;
technical assistance and training proposal indicating proposed beneficiaries (by type),&#13;
numbers of activities (e.g., events, consultants, etc.), expected subject matter and&#13;
estimated costs. The aggregate dollar amount of technical assistance included in each&#13;
proposal would be based on a series of parameters, such as the number of subprojects&#13;
expected, the estimated number of new Municipal Councils, and the estimated number of&#13;
communities needing mobilization assistance or general technical support. During the&#13;
course of the year, each actual technical assistance and training event would require&#13;
detailed terms of reference, outlining the objective and contents of each event. The PCU&#13;
would provide the Municipal Councils with a framework for the annual technical&#13;
assistance and training proposals and with model terms of reference to facilitate their&#13;
access to Institutional Development funds.&#13;
4.    Types of contracts under the Institutional Development component would range&#13;
from short-term contracts for single training events, to longer-term retainer contracts for a&#13;
series of training or technical assistance activities to be performed over a period of time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -                          Annex E&#13;
For example, Municipal Councils may contract the services of a local extension agent to&#13;
follow-up and provide technical assistance to all community subprojects within the&#13;
municipality. Also, training in basic accounting and recordkeeping may be needed by a&#13;
number of community associations with productive subprojects and would best be handled&#13;
by having the PCU contract a specialized NGO to conduct in situ training with various&#13;
community associations over a period of a year. The flexibility of contract types reflects&#13;
the diversity of technical assistance and training needs of the various entities participating&#13;
in the project. However, to reduce the administrative task of processing a series of&#13;
contracts and to take advantage of economies of scale, technical assistance and training&#13;
events would be packaged whenever possible.&#13;
5.    The funds for institutional development at the project level will be administered by&#13;
the PCU. The PCU will contract all technical assistance and training for the PAC program&#13;
and in cases of packaging or upon request by the Municipal Councils within the FUMAC&#13;
program. FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils may contract technical assistance&#13;
and training for themselves or, upon request, for beneficiary associations, with the&#13;
assistance of the PCU and on the basis of standard terms of reference. The PCU would&#13;
monitor the use of institutional development funds by the Municipal Councils and likewise&#13;
by beneficiary associations through review of statements of expenditure (SOEs) and&#13;
periodic supervision.&#13;
6.    Percentage of subproject cost targeted to technical assistance. At the&#13;
discretion of community associations, subproject proposals may include an allocation of&#13;
the total amount to be directed to the contracting of technical assistance for preparation&#13;
and/or implementation of the subproject. The percentage would vary from 2% to 8% of&#13;
the subproject cost, and would be subject to criteria such as the complexity of the&#13;
subproject, whether a standard subproject exists, and other factors, with the final&#13;
determination made by the Municipal Councils (FUMAC and FUMAC-P) and the PCU&#13;
(PAC).&#13;
7.    For technical assistance and training financed as a percentage of the subproject&#13;
cost, each proposed program would need to be described in detail in the subproject&#13;
proposal. For technical assistance during subproject preparation, the service provider&#13;
would necessarily work in an "at-risk" situation, since the reimbursement for services&#13;
provided would only be provided if the subproject is indeed approved and funded under&#13;
the project. However, to avoid the risk of hampering the provision --under this mode-- of&#13;
technical assistance for subproject preparation, community associations can request&#13;
Municipal Councils to use resources from the institutional development component instead&#13;
to contract the required assistance. For technical assistance provided as a percentage of&#13;
subproject cost after subproject approval, the funds allocated to technical assistance would&#13;
be disbursed to the beneficiary association directly. The beneficiary association would&#13;
contract the extensionist/entity under procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
described in the Operational Manual. For "turn-key"-type contracts, where the technical&#13;
assistance provider helps prepare and then implement the subproject, a smaller percentage&#13;
would be paid for the preparation assistance vis-a-vis the implementation assistance, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                            Annex E&#13;
order to direct the financial incentive toward the successful implementation of the&#13;
subproject.&#13;
8.    For greater effectiveness, technical assistance to subprojects should extend into the&#13;
post-implementation (i.e., operation and maintenance) period, particularly for productive&#13;
subprojects where success depends on the association's capacity to operate and administer&#13;
the small enterprise. Therefore, as a prerequisite for approval of productive subprojects,&#13;
community associations would have to provide a satisfactory technical assistance plan with&#13;
the service provider identified. In addition, as part of their commitment to sufficiently&#13;
operate and maintain their subprojects, the community associations should include&#13;
technical assistance among the expenditures to be financed out of the O&amp;M funds&#13;
maintained by each association. The PCU and the Municipal Councils would actively&#13;
encourage this practice during routine monitoring and supervision.&#13;
SERVICE PROVIDERS&#13;
9.    The identification and mobilization of technical assistance and training providers is&#13;
a crucial complement to the availability of resources. The most important providers of&#13;
technical assistance would continue to be the PCU and the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
Other service providers are readily identifiable from their participation in the reformulated&#13;
NRDP:&#13;
(a)   Multilateral and bilateral technical assistance agencies--international&#13;
technical assistance organizations contracted by the PCU can provide&#13;
technical assistance to the PCU and the Municipal Councils at the project&#13;
level;&#13;
(b)   EMATER extensionists--in each municipality, local accredited agents&#13;
would be identified by the PCU to be contracted by individual community&#13;
associations for work on a particular subproject, or by Municipal Councils,&#13;
on a retainer contract, for clearly-specified work with several communities.&#13;
An umbrella agreement between the PCU and EMATER would map out&#13;
the framework for this type of assistance. As a rule, the project would&#13;
channel resources (only for incremental operating costs; not salaries)&#13;
directly to the local level and not to the central, state-level agency, thereby&#13;
stimulating greater local participation, rewarding effective agents and&#13;
penalizing those that do not effectively provide the assistance needed; and,&#13;
(c)   NGOs--staff from local grassroots organizations can serve as accredited&#13;
agents, as described in the paragraph above, or the NGOs themselves car&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -                           Annex E&#13;
enter into contracts with associations, the Municipal Councils or the PCU&#13;
for global or specific technical assistance and training activities.&#13;
10.   The PCU and Municipal Councils would be charged with developing lists and&#13;
contacting other potential sources of technical assistance, such as: university students,&#13;
local private organizations, private extensionists, and state agencies. These lists would be&#13;
updated annually and would be available at the local level.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
11.   To create institutional incentives in the PCU to promote accountability for&#13;
technical assistance and training activities, technical assistance would need to be a more&#13;
visible and effective line function within the PCU. The PCU would therefore nominate&#13;
from among its staff a high-level Technical Assistance Coordinator. The Coordinator&#13;
would be responsible for overseeing the Institutional Development component and the&#13;
technical assistance arrangements stemming from the percentage method, described above.&#13;
The main tasks of the Coordinator would be to: (a) develop the technical assistance and&#13;
training framework under the project; (b) identify and contact potential technical&#13;
assistance providers and maintain updated lists for each municipality and for the project as&#13;
a whole; (c) identify and prepare potential local accredited agents; (d) prepare the annual&#13;
technical assistance and training proposal for the project; (e) assist the Municipal Councils&#13;
in the preparation of the annual technical assistance and training proposals and review the&#13;
proposals presented by each Municipal Council; (f) develop model terms of reference for&#13;
specific technical assistance activities and training events; (g) encourage replication of&#13;
successful technical assistance and training activities wherever possible; and, (h) based on&#13;
supervision findings, measure and report on the progress of technical assistance&#13;
arrangements and their effectiveness.&#13;
12.   As part of their regular supervision efforts, the PCU and the Municipal Councils&#13;
would monitor the frequency and quality of technical assistance and training provided to&#13;
each subproject. SOEs presented by Municipal Councils and community associations for&#13;
technical assistance and training expenditures would be closely monitored by the PCU to&#13;
ensure that resources are used exclusively for that purpose and in a cost-effective manner.&#13;
As further incentive for their effective use, loan funds allocated to the Institutional&#13;
Development component will not be permitted to be re-allocated to finance community&#13;
subprojects or any other expenditure under the project. To give Municipal Councils&#13;
greater incentive to promote and achieve successful technical assistance arrangements in&#13;
their respective municipalities, the provision of technical assistance, both by the Councils&#13;
and other providers, would be considered a parameter by which to judge the overall&#13;
performance of project Municipal Councils and would factor into decision-making on the&#13;
promotion of FUMAC Councils to FUMAC-P. Technical assistance would also be&#13;
monitored through the project's monitoring and reporting arrangements (see Annex H).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                            Annex E&#13;
Information from the MIS would identify active technical assistance contracts which will&#13;
then be followed up during subproject supervision visits. The mid-year and annual project&#13;
progress reports, compiled by the PCU for the Bank, would contain specific sections&#13;
pertaining to the quantity, quality and effectiveness of technical assistance provided. The&#13;
project implementation review (Annex H) would also evaluate the quality and cost-&#13;
effectiveness of technical assistance and thus provide the beneficiaries' assessment of&#13;
technical assistance arrangements. The Bank's Recife Office would evaluate the project's&#13;
technical assistance arrangements during regular supervision visits.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PIAUI&#13;
F. THE FUMAC-P PILOT PROGRAM&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Decentralization of decision-making and the transfer of project implementation&#13;
responsibilities from the State to the local (municipal and community) levels, started under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP with the introduction of the community-based PAC and FUMAC&#13;
programs, will be further advanced in the proposed project. First, FUMAC coverage will&#13;
expand significantly under the project. Second, a further step towards decentralization&#13;
will be taken through a pilot program, FUMAC-P, which will promote the transfer of&#13;
financial management responsibilities to several FUMAC Municipal Councils.&#13;
2.    Generally, municipalities which have participated in FUMAC to date tend to be&#13;
those in which the environment for participatory decision-making is more favorable, which&#13;
distinguishes them from more traditionally-run municipalities with a strong "clientelistic"&#13;
approach. This environment has been the result of a conjunction of cultural/political&#13;
factors, such as the emergence of a movement for the development of civil society (usually&#13;
induced by religious organizations, NGOs and more recently by some political parties) and&#13;
of a new generation of more open-minded political leaders.&#13;
3.    Several important lessons have emerged from the FUMAC experience under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP. First, it has proved to be an efficient, transparent approach for&#13;
identifying and prioritizing, through local-level consensus building, multiple demands for&#13;
investments by needy communities. Second, it has provided the opportunity to experiment&#13;
not only with increased transfer of decision-making, including approval of subprojects,&#13;
from the State-level Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) to Municipal Councils representing&#13;
communities, but also with the management of community subproject funds by these very&#13;
Councils. This experience is reflected in the proposed project in the design of FUMAC&#13;
and, in particular, FUMAC-P, where the feasibility of financial management at the&#13;
grassroots level will be tested.&#13;
FUMAC-P: MAIN FEATURES&#13;
4.    The FUMAC-P pilot would account, initially, for about US$2.8 million -- or 7% of&#13;
the total base cost of the project -- over the four-year implementation period. As it is&#13;
considered that, in order to motivate project Municipal Councils (both FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P) and have them participate in the Project in a sustainable manner, each Council&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -                          Annex F&#13;
--and its communities-- should benefit from a minimum of 5 subprojects per year, the&#13;
initial amount allocated to this subcomponent would allow the installation of about 5&#13;
FUMAC-P Councils by the end of the project period. However, if this pilot approach&#13;
proves successful with the communities and meets its objectives of local-level investment&#13;
selection, execution and financial management, FUMAC-P would be expanded with funds&#13;
initially earmarked for the FUMAC and PAC subcomponents (see para. 10) and more&#13;
FUMAC-P Councils than initially foreseen could be set up during project implementation.&#13;
5.    Initially, the PCU would select FlUMAC-P municipalities from among the best&#13;
FUMAC performers under the ongoing NRDP, i.e., those with the best record in&#13;
administering and executing community subprojects. Additionally, other municipalities&#13;
which have a favorable environment for participatory work (extensive community&#13;
organization, municipal officials open to participative decision-making, etc.), and are&#13;
interested and can commit themselves to following project guidelines, could be included.&#13;
There should also be some indication that local capacity exists to manage financial&#13;
resources, for instance in communities or existing associations already managing small-&#13;
scale businesses (on an individual or group basis) and whose members could potentially&#13;
form part of FUMAC-P Municipal Councils. As the proposed project gets underway, and&#13;
the FUMAC-P approach proves successful, other well-performing FUMAC municipalities&#13;
could gradually be upgraded into FUMAC-P municipalities.&#13;
6.    Once the municipalities are selected, allocation of funds would be done based on a&#13;
number of criteria to which different weights will be assigned. These criteria may include&#13;
several of the following:&#13;
(a)   ratio of rural to total population;&#13;
(b)   rate of indigence;&#13;
(c)   number and degree of dispersion of poor rural communities;&#13;
(d)   availability of public resources per capita;&#13;
(e)   number of subprojects approved under the reformulated NRDP (small&#13;
discriminatory factor);&#13;
(f)   performance in the previous year; and&#13;
(g)   willingness of the mayor (prefeito) to participate.&#13;
7.    FUMAC-P Municipal Councils would have the same composition and modes of&#13;
operation as FUMAC Municipal Councils (Annex D). They would be responsible for:&#13;
(a)   assisting rural communities in identifying priority needs and translating&#13;
them into investment proposals;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                          Annex F&#13;
(b)   screening and reviewing these proposals, and ensuring that they meet&#13;
eligibility criteria as contained in the Project Operational Manual;&#13;
(c)   monitoring and supervising, together with the PCU, the implementation of&#13;
approved subprojects;&#13;
(d)   providing, directly or through contracting, technical assistance and training&#13;
to beneficiary associations in the design and operation and maintenance of&#13;
project-financed investments;&#13;
(e)   managing subproject funds and transferring funds to beneficiary&#13;
associations with approved subprojects; and&#13;
(f)   preparing indicative annual operating plans (POAs) for review and&#13;
approval by the PCU. The POA would contain a list of community&#13;
investment priorities, indicative targets to be met, a tentative timetable, the&#13;
indicative budget and the technical assistance required to implement the&#13;
proposed program. The PCU would review and approve the POA at the&#13;
end of the year preceding implementation.&#13;
8.    An agreement (convenio) between the PCU and the Municipal Council would&#13;
establish the terms and conditions as well as rights and obligations of each party with&#13;
respect to the release and use of the approved funds. These (both loan and state&#13;
counterpart funds) would be deposited into an account in a commercial bank, and would&#13;
be withdrawn solely upon formal order by the Municipal Council. The Council would&#13;
screen community subproject proposals on the basis of the approved POA and the funds&#13;
made available by the PCU. An agreement (convenio) between the Municipal Council and&#13;
the beneficiary association would be required.&#13;
9.    Regular supervision of the operations of the FUMAC-P Municipal Councils would&#13;
be the responsibility of the PCU, focusing in particular on the administrative and financial&#13;
arrangements made by the Councils to effectively control and release project funds to the&#13;
community associations and on progress in the implementation of the POA agreed for&#13;
each FUMAC-P Council. Municipal Councils would be aided in their tasks, both for&#13;
management and accounting as well as subproject appraisal, monitoring and supervision,&#13;
by appropriate technical assistance under the guidance of the PCU. Unsatisfactory&#13;
performance of a Council would have to be carefully assessed by the latter, including the&#13;
weighing of penalties, if necessary. If unsatisfactory performance is not rapidly corrected,&#13;
it may lead to a reduction of the budget envelope allocated to it the next year (para. 6) or,&#13;
in the case of serious wrongdoing such as misappropriation or misuse of funds, to legal&#13;
remedies, combined with restructuring of the Council or even its expulsion from FUMAC-&#13;
P back to FUMAC. On the other hand, built-in incentives would encourage positive&#13;
performance. Positive performance, for example, would be rewarded with a potential&#13;
expansion in the budget envelope allocated each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -                          Annex F&#13;
10.   In addition, the project implementation review to be carried out at mid-term would&#13;
include a specific evaluation of the FUMAC-P program. The basic purpose of this&#13;
evaluation will be to assess performance under the pilot program and, if necessary, to&#13;
adjust its design and mechanisms in order to improve its procedures and impact on&#13;
beneficiaries. If the pilot program is found successful and its expansion is justified, part of&#13;
the PAC and FUMAC funds under the project could be transferred to the FUMAC-P&#13;
program.&#13;

G. STANDARD DESIGNS AND OPERATION AND&#13;
MAINTENANCE OF SUBPROJECTS&#13;
STANDARD DESIGNS&#13;
1.    Experience under the NRDP has shown that the technical elaboration of&#13;
subprojects can be a difficult task for rural community associations. In some cases,&#13;
especially where competent technical assistance is not available locally, this has resulted in&#13;
inappropriate design, cost overruns and subprojects left incomplete or unoperational.&#13;
Under the proposed project, preparation of subprojects by associations, as well as&#13;
appraisal of the technical proposals by Municipal Councils and/or the Project Coordinating&#13;
Unit (PCU), will be facilitated with the adoption of standard designs developed by the&#13;
PCU for the most common types of subprojects found in Piaui. The use of standard&#13;
designs will ensure that, at least for those subprojects most in demand by communities,&#13;
project investments follow recommended technical specifications, both for construction&#13;
and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), meet reasonable cost parameters so as to be&#13;
financially viable, and comply with all necessary environmental requirements. At the same&#13;
time, the risk of "directing" community demand towards subprojects for which standard&#13;
designs will be made available would be reduced by the project's information campaign&#13;
which informs communities, inter alia, about the variety of subprojects that are eligible for&#13;
financing.&#13;
2.    Different standard designs (projetos padrao) or appropriate standard&#13;
documentation will be prepared for the various types of investments: productive,&#13;
infrastructure and social subprojects. The main items to be included in each of the&#13;
relevant documentation are indicated below.&#13;
3 .    For productive subprojects:&#13;
(a)    a summary of the existing situation, including considerations on demand,&#13;
supply of raw materials, as well as markets;&#13;
(b)   a set of considerations and parameters to carry out simplified feasibility&#13;
studies, in particular: a presentation of subproject objectives and potential&#13;
benefits; the technical production process and type of equipment required;&#13;
technical parameters such as expected yields, coefficient of utilization,&#13;
range of output; range of costs of production, depreciation, maintenance&#13;
etc.; expected benefits and number of beneficiaries; indicative internal rates&#13;
of return, benefit/cost ratios, and other such indicators;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                              Annex G&#13;
(c)   technical aspects, including a description of civil works, technical&#13;
specifications, bill of quantities, and the list of suppliers of equipment&#13;
required to operate the subproject;&#13;
(d)    guidelines for O&amp;M; and&#13;
(e)    environmental considerations and recommendations for specific measures&#13;
to mitigate the negative impact, if any, of the proposed subproject.&#13;
In addition, a set of operating rules (regulamento de uso) will accompany the&#13;
documentation for each of the proposed productive subprojects.&#13;
4.     For social subprojects:&#13;
(a)    a methodology for establishing the profile of social demand in order to&#13;
properly tailor the size of the required facility;&#13;
(b)    design considerations, e.g., services to be delivered by the proposed&#13;
subproject, and technical, legal and administrative aspects;&#13;
(c)    technical aspects as for productive subprojects;&#13;
(d)    O&amp;M features, including an evaluation of the delivery costs of the&#13;
proposed social service; and&#13;
(e)    environmental considerations where relevant.&#13;
5.     For infrastructure subprojects, whose size can vary widely depending on the local&#13;
context, intended number of beneficiaries and other factors, the concept of standard design&#13;
as such is not totally adequate. However, it is possible to develop:&#13;
(a)    generic terms of reference for engineering of different types of subprojects,&#13;
e.g., water supply systems, road rehabilitation, etc.; and&#13;
(b)    "typical" engineering (projetos tipicos) of small works such as pipes and&#13;
box culverts, retaining walls, typical decks for small bridges, etc.&#13;
6.     Standard designs will be available for those types of subprojects that most respond&#13;
to the needs and demand of communities. By project effectiveness, a first group of&#13;
standard designs will have been prepared by the PCU, and listed in the project Operational&#13;
Manual, for the following ten types of subprojects: communal markets, communal stores,&#13;
manioc mills, agricultural machinery (communal tractors, etc.), small-scale irrigation,&#13;
agro-processing (rice and other cereals), cashew-nut processing, fruit processing, health&#13;
posts and public telephones. A second group of standard subproject designs for other&#13;
types of subprojects that are requested by at least 10 different communities, will be&#13;
elaborated by the end of the first year of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                           Annex G&#13;
7.    Careful field supervision and monitoring of standard subprojects by the PCU will&#13;
be necessary in order to: (i) avoid mistakes to be replicated on a large scale, and (ii) fine-&#13;
tune and adjust the standard designs that have been developed. The need for the different&#13;
participating states to share experience on standard designs of subprojects has also been&#13;
identified. In particular, those that have been prepared by the first three states (Bahia,&#13;
Ceara and Sergipe) could be shared by Piaui and others. Workshops should be arranged&#13;
in which standard subproject documentation developed by the different states would be&#13;
used for discussions to compare and evaluate the different solutions that have been found&#13;
for the same problem.&#13;
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
8.    Although the reformulated NRDP has financed many of the same types of&#13;
community investments (e.g., manioc mills or small-scale rural water supply projects) that&#13;
have been supported under past programs or projects in the Northeast, one of its&#13;
innovative features has been to ensure that these investments are operated and maintained&#13;
by the beneficiaries themselves, thereby enhancing their sense of ownership and the&#13;
prospects for sustainability of the investments. Under the proposed project, this feature&#13;
will be maintained and strengthened.&#13;
9.    Community associations will bear the primary responsibility for O&amp;M for most&#13;
project-funded investments, and this provision will be included in the agreements&#13;
(convenzos) with the associations. The relative responsibilities of the associations for&#13;
O&amp;M would vary according to the type of investment. As a general rule, beneficiaries&#13;
would be fully responsible for operating and maintaining their own productive subprojects&#13;
and some social subprojects, such as day care centers or home improvements for health&#13;
purposes (e.g., for control of Chagas disease). In the case of schools or health posts&#13;
rehabilitated under the project, and most infrastructure subprojects, the responsibility for&#13;
O&amp;M would normally be shared between the communities and the relevant State or&#13;
municipal institution. In exceptional cases of relatively complex subprojects, beneficiary&#13;
associations might contract private firms or NGOs to assist them in O&amp;M tasks.&#13;
10.   Based on experience under the reformulated NRDP, several types of arrangements&#13;
would be implemented in order to ensure the financial sustainability of project investments,&#13;
as follows:&#13;
11.   Productive Subprojects (e.g., manioc and rice mills, clothes making, small-scale&#13;
irrigation schemes, and farm machinery). Once a subproject has been approved for&#13;
financing, the beneficiary association elects a committee to be in charge of subproject&#13;
implementation and management. This committee has the task, among others, of&#13;
determining the different dues and user fees to be charged to association members (as well&#13;
as to non-association members using project facilities), based on estimated requirements&#13;
for O&amp;M and capital replacement or eventual expansion. User fees have to be approved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-95-                             Annex G&#13;
by all association members, and may be paid in cash, labor or kind, depending on the&#13;
particular situation. The committee is responsible for collecting the fees, placing them in a&#13;
"reserve fund", managing the reserve fund to meet extraordinary maintenance and capital&#13;
replacement requirements, and making payments for recurrent expenditures such as&#13;
electricity consumption, fuel, inputs, repairs, and employees' salaries.&#13;
12.   Social Subprojects (e.g., day care centers, housing improvement, school or health&#13;
post rehabilitation). The degree of community involvement in the O&amp;M of social&#13;
subprojects depends on the type of investment. In the case of subprojects related to public&#13;
services, such as health posts or schools, the municipality or relevant public/private entity&#13;
could undertake O&amp;M following an agreement with the community. For other types of&#13;
subprojects such as day care centers or house improvement, the community will be&#13;
responsible for O&amp;M, each of the community members contributing either financially or in&#13;
the form of labor.&#13;
13.   Infrastructure Subprojects (e.g., small bridges, water supply systems, fords,&#13;
road repairs). Different arrangements are to be followed for O&amp;M of infrastructure&#13;
subprojects. In the case of services (e.g., water supply) connected to individual&#13;
households, beneficiaries could transfer the corresponding assets to the relevant state or&#13;
municipal utility company, which then undertakes O&amp;M and recovers costs through user&#13;
fees. Simplified water supply systems (without connection to households) will be&#13;
operated and maintained by the community itself, which makes arrangements for collection&#13;
of dues or fees from individual community members to pay for O&amp;M expenses. These&#13;
arrangements are commonly found in the rural water supply subprojects financed under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP. For infrastructure subprojects such as roads, bridges, and street&#13;
paving, which serve a larger public, responsibility for O&amp;M would normally be shared&#13;
with the municipality under agreement with the beneficiary association.&#13;

H. PROJECT MONITORING, REPORTING AND&#13;
EVALUATION&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
1.    The establishment of an efficient project monitoring system will be instrumental in&#13;
following the progression of the investment program financed by the proposed Piaui Rural&#13;
Poverty Alleviation Project and ascertaining its consistency with project objectives.&#13;
Project implementation relies heavily on a decentralized system of decision-making and&#13;
management, and is driven by demand from rural community associations which is filtered&#13;
through a selection process based on established criteria. This process involves a large&#13;
number of small, diverse subprojects over an extensive geographic area. Hence, since the&#13;
ex ante determination of the pattern of project investment and other key parameters is not&#13;
possible, effective supervision depends on the existence of a capable monitoring system.&#13;
2.    The objectives of the project monitoring system are to:&#13;
(a)   provide information regarding the progress of the project and the status of&#13;
the subproject cycle in its different stages (e.g., subproject approval,&#13;
procurement, implementation and disbursement); and&#13;
(b)   verify that project activities are consistent with the guidelines, targeting&#13;
methodology and selection criteria included in the Project Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
Project Database&#13;
3.    The project monitoring system would depend on a Management Information&#13;
System (MIS), created under the reformulated NRDP' and to be improved under the&#13;
project. The project MIS is a data base organized in three general levels: (a) a subproject&#13;
information module, which contains pertinent physical and financial information for each&#13;
1 Under the reformulated NRDP, this system was referred to as the SSMP, or Simplified Project&#13;
Monitoring System.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-97 -                           Annex H&#13;
subproject; (b) a financial management module, from which Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOEs) are generated; and (c) a project management module, from which all project&#13;
reports are generated. Under the proposed project, the MIS will operate as a network to&#13;
facilitate the inputting of information and provide access to up-to-the-minute information&#13;
by all levels of project management, tailored to individual needs.&#13;
4.    For the State of Piaui, the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) would be responsible&#13;
for operating and maintaining the MIS and for providing the input corresponding to PAC&#13;
subprojects. The project Municipal Councils would be responsible for completing the data&#13;
sheets for FUMAC and FUMAC-P subprojects and, upon completion of each data sheet,&#13;
would present them to the PCU which would subsequently update the MIS.&#13;
5.    The subproject module is the basic module into which all information collected&#13;
from the subprojects is entered and processed. Subproject information feeds into both the&#13;
financial management module and the project management module. Subprojects are&#13;
identified and entered in the MIS according to the following format. Information for the&#13;
MIS is inputted from data sheets for each subproject, separated into four submodules&#13;
which correspond to key steps of the subproject cycle:&#13;
(a)   Submodule No. 1 would include information for the subproject regarding&#13;
its location and identification, according to the following format: (a) by&#13;
program [PAC, FUMAC, and FUMAC-P]; (b) by type [Infrastructure,&#13;
Productive and Social subprojects]; (c) by category [e.g., water supply,&#13;
agro-processing, energy, etc.]; (d) by sub-category, in particular for water&#13;
supply subprojects [e.g., dams, wells, tanks, etc.]; and, (e) by location&#13;
[municipality, community and beneficiary association];&#13;
(b)   Submodule No. 2 would include the technical, social and financial&#13;
characteristics, as well as a set of indicators such as cost/capita, cost/M2,&#13;
and other parameters to the subproject budget;&#13;
(c)   Submodule No. 3 would include information on subproject implementation,&#13;
including procurement procedures and contracting, all disbursement data,&#13;
including beneficiary and municipal government contributions to&#13;
counterpart funding, and provision of technical assistance and training to&#13;
the community association in question; and&#13;
(d)   Submodule No. 4 would include subproject completion information,&#13;
including beneficiary numbers and relevant subproject impacts (e.g.,&#13;
production figures, income generated, etc.).&#13;
6.    The information input into the MIS would come from standard data sheets of three&#13;
types: (i) subproject data sheet; (ii) supervision data sheet; and (iii) graduation data sheet.&#13;
The subproject data sheet, completed by the PCU (for PAC) and the Municipal Councils&#13;
(for FUMAC and FUMAC-P) would supply the basic information on the subproject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -                          Annex H&#13;
stemming from the subproject proposal. The supervision data sheet would verify and/or&#13;
update information on the subproject data sheet, identify any implementation problems and&#13;
possible mitigating measures, and report relevant subproject impacts. The supervision&#13;
data sheets would be completed by the PCU and Municipal Councils, or by those entities&#13;
subcontracted to provide supervision services, in which case the supervision data sheets&#13;
would be included in the TORs. Finally, the graduation data sheets would include&#13;
information on the community itself, including existing infrastructure and other indicators&#13;
of community well-being (see Annex C), to be filled out by the beneficiary community&#13;
associations as part of their subproject proposals, and verified and/or updated by the PCU,&#13;
Municipal Councils, or subcontracted participating agencies.&#13;
7.    Given the 1,770 subprojects estimated to be financed during the four years of&#13;
project implementation, the MIS is an essential tool for following the course of project&#13;
investment. Information from the MIS is also fundamental to measure compliance with,&#13;
and subsequent effectiveness of, the project's targeting mechanisms. By monitoring the&#13;
direction of project benefits and types of subprojects being financed, the PCU and the&#13;
Municipal Councils can direct appropriate technical assistance and training based on the&#13;
frequency of certain types of investment or target community mobilization activities.&#13;
Cases of mistargeting or misappropriation of funds -- resources channeled outside the&#13;
project area or for ineligible investments -- will be verified using the MIS in order for&#13;
appropriate remedies to be applied.&#13;
Monitoring Activities&#13;
8.    Within the framework of the project monitoring system, the PCU and the project&#13;
Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-P) are responsible for supervising the&#13;
application of the guidelines from the Operational Manual in the development and&#13;
implementation of all subprojects. Using the information from the MIS, combined with&#13;
field visits and inputs from project supervision reports, project-contracted studies and&#13;
audits, the PCU and the Municipal Councils would monitor project characteristics and&#13;
trends, identify implementation problems and accomplishments and undertake or promote&#13;
appropriate actions to improve project implementation (see Annex J on Project&#13;
Supervision). The MIS will also serve as a basis from which to derive Annual Operating&#13;
Plans (POAs), regulate their implementation, and make necessary adjustments to the&#13;
POAs and corresponding budgets during the course of each fiscal year. The delineation of&#13;
monitoring responsibilities between the PCU and the Municipal Councils would be clearly&#13;
reflected in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
PROJECT REPORTING&#13;
9.    The PCU is responsible for reporting on project progress to the Bank. Four types&#13;
of reports would be generated by the PCU and presented to the Bank:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-99-                            Annex H&#13;
(a)   a copy of the content of the MIS data base on diskette would be provided&#13;
on a monthly basis to the Bank's Field Office in Recife. The information&#13;
from the MIS will facilitate Bank supervision efforts and monitoring of the&#13;
investment program;&#13;
(b)   an MIS-generated report which would include the updated status of project&#13;
implementation (USPI) and an updated list of subprojects with their&#13;
physical, procurement and disbursement status would be provided to the&#13;
Bank's Field Office in Recife at the same time that the statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs) are sent to Bank Headquarters. The USPI and&#13;
subproject list will permit the Recife Office to review the eligibility of&#13;
subprojects presented for reimbursement,&#13;
(c)   a Mid-year Project Progress Report, using standard formats agreed with&#13;
the Bank, would be presented by July 31 of each year of project&#13;
implementation; and,&#13;
(d)   an Annual Report, would be presented by January 31 of each year of&#13;
project implementation. The Annual Report would use the standard&#13;
formats from the mid-year report but would also include a comprehensive&#13;
review of: (i) the status of the project performance indicators and the&#13;
specific activities of the institutional development component; (ii)&#13;
subproject appraisal indicators, the status of the targeting of project&#13;
benefits, the application of subproject investment eligibility criteria, and&#13;
other implementation guidelines included in the Operation Manual; and (iii)&#13;
other relevant analyses and recommendations from project-contracted&#13;
studies and audits which may be applied to improve project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
PROJECT EVALUATION STUDIES&#13;
10.   The project would develop and implement a range of evaluation studies to measure&#13;
the impact of the subproject investments and to provide appropriate feedback to improve&#13;
project methodology and implementation. The PCU would be responsible for drafting&#13;
Terms of Reference (TORs), which would form part of the Project Operational Manual,&#13;
and contracting local and other consulting services, both steps in agreement with the&#13;
Bank, for the following studies: (a) annual physical performance reviews; (b) a mid-term&#13;
implementation review; and (c) a comprehensive impact evaluation. These studies are&#13;
described below. In addition, the project would finance a study to determine the point of&#13;
community graduation and details on this study are included in Annex C. During the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100 -                           Annex H&#13;
course of project implementation, the PCU may also identify other needed evaluation&#13;
studies which can be financed under the project in agreement with the Bank.&#13;
Annual Physical Performance Reviews&#13;
11.   The objective of the Physical Performance Review (PPR) is to evaluate the success&#13;
of investments financed by the project, in terms of their achievement of specific subproject&#13;
objectives, and the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of the investments. For each&#13;
subproject included in the sample, the study would focus on the following points: (a) the&#13;
adequacy of the physical design in relation to the subproject's objective; (b) the quality and&#13;
cost of subproject execution; (c) the efficiency of procurement procedures used; and (e)&#13;
the targeting of project benefits. The PPR would provide indication of the effectiveness of&#13;
community-based procurement; compliance with and/or needed adjustments to cost&#13;
indicators and other physical/financial appraisal indicators and to the Standard Designs&#13;
included in the Operational Manual; and the quality of project investments and the profile&#13;
of distribution of project benefits. The PPR will also be an important input to the project's&#13;
implementation review and to project Annual Reports.&#13;
12.   The PPR will be conducted on the basis of TORs agreed with the Bank and&#13;
included in the Operational Manual. The first PPR will be conducted at the end of 1997&#13;
for a sample of subprojects representative of the prior year's investment program (PAC,&#13;
FUMAC, and FUMAC-P). To conduct the PPR, the PCU would: (i) establish, with Bank&#13;
agreement, the sample of subprojects to be reviewed; (ii) supply counterparts to the&#13;
independent consultants contracted by the PCU to implement the study; (iii) participate in&#13;
the diagnosis and generation of appropriate recommendations; and (iv) incorporate the&#13;
recommendations into the implementation of the project. Subsequent PPRs would be&#13;
conducted each year and would review physical performance issues identified during the&#13;
first PPR and monitor improvements. TORs for the remaining PPRs would be agreed&#13;
with the Bank by no later than July 31 of each corresponding year.&#13;
13.   In addition, the first PPR will include a module to measure the quality and&#13;
efficiency of community procurement (direct contracting) of goods and works. Similar to&#13;
an audit, this module of the PPR would analyze the contracting procedures used and the&#13;
accompanying documentation for a sample of subprojects. The issues to be examined&#13;
would include: (a) the transparency of the contracting process; (b) if the goods/works&#13;
were procured at the lowest cost for the quality required and how these costs compare&#13;
with the unit cost references in the MIS; (c) in the case of technical assistance, if the&#13;
service providers contracted satisfied the profile and experience indicated in the TORs;&#13;
and (d) if the documentation maintained by the community association is sufficient to&#13;
complete Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) and to satisfy an audit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -                          Annex H&#13;
Implementation Review&#13;
14.   Project performance would be measured through an in implementation review at&#13;
the mid-term of project implementation. The purpose of the implementation review is to&#13;
assist the State Government of Piaui, the PCU and the Bank, in the identification of&#13;
positive experiences and implementation problems and bottlenecks, particularly in&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P, in order to recommend needed modifications to their&#13;
methodology and design. Importantly, since the FUMAC-P program is a pilot, this mid-&#13;
term review would determine its feasibility and recommend its expansion.&#13;
15.   The mid-term review would be carried out through beneficiary consultations--&#13;
interviews and group discussions. These consultations would determine, inter alia: (i)&#13;
how the project is perceived and valued by the actual beneficiaries; (ii) level of community&#13;
participation -- and any outside involvement (e.g. NGOs, EMATER, etc.) -- in the&#13;
different stages of the subproject cycle, including in the process of prioritizing local&#13;
demands; (iii) effectiveness of the subprojects in alleviating poverty and its consequences;&#13;
(iv) the access to and quality of technical assistance for the preparation, implementation&#13;
and O&amp;M of subprojects; (iv) the role of the Municipal Councils, how these Councils are&#13;
perceived in the communities, and how decisions on prioritization are effectively made;&#13;
(vi) the role of Mayors in decision-making and in actual project implementation; (vii) the&#13;
operation and maintenance of subprojects; and (v) how the role and performance of the&#13;
PCU is viewed in the communities (for PAC). Additional questions would evaluate the&#13;
efficiency and impact of the different subcomponents (PAC, FUMAC and FUMAC-P), the&#13;
effectiveness of institutional development activities, the level of community participation,&#13;
and the ability of the project to target and reach the poor. Overall, the beneficiary&#13;
consultations would generate a reliable evaluation of project performance and impact as&#13;
seen through the eyes of the ultimate beneficiaries which would serve as a convincing&#13;
input to improve project implementation.&#13;
16.   The implementation review would be carried out at the end of the second year of&#13;
project implementation with a sample of community associations drawn from FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P municipalities, with a small residual sample drawn from PAC municipalities,&#13;
and a sample of Municipal Councils. The implementation review would be carried out by&#13;
independent consultants -- preferably a local organization with field experience -- under&#13;
TORs and contracting procedures agreed with the Bank. Inputs to the review process&#13;
would include: the mid-year and annual reports, MIS-generated analyses and reports,&#13;
results of the PPRs, recommendations from project audit reports, and additional reviews&#13;
or studies contracted by the PCU.&#13;
Project Impact Evaluation&#13;
17.   The project would also finance a baseline (year 1) and final (year 4) evaluation to&#13;
measure the socio-economic impact of the subproject investments. This comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -                          Annex H&#13;
evaluation, based on a random sample survey of representative subproject types, would&#13;
select important socio-economic indicators, such as employment, income, health,&#13;
education, and migration, and measure the impact of subproject investments on these&#13;
indicators and consequently the impact of the project on the quality of life of the&#13;
beneficiary population, differentiating by gender where possible. The evaluation would&#13;
also relate impact back to specific aspects of the project in order to identify those&#13;
conditions or activities which have resulted in positive impacts.&#13;
18.   The evaluation study would also measure the effects of the project on the financial&#13;
situation at the municipal and state levels, due to the positive impacts on project&#13;
beneficiaries (communities and families). For example, the financing of subprojects for&#13;
community water supply implies savings for municipal governments, and even State and&#13;
Federal Governments, in drought periods by preempting the need of these governments to&#13;
finance temporary water provision to rural communities through carropipa, typically a&#13;
signficant expenditure for municipal governments of the Northeast and one which is not&#13;
made to the extent needed due to limited resources. The project would also generate&#13;
benefits in terms of improved health or, in general terms, in improved quality of life for&#13;
beneficiaries, which would result in savings for the State or municipal governments in&#13;
medical services, medicines, etc., furnished to rural communities. In addition, the project&#13;
produces products over which the State and municipal governments can collect taxes&#13;
(such as the ICMS tax on marketed production). These products can include not only&#13;
products generated by productive subprojects but also consumer goods (e.g. refrigerators,&#13;
radios, etc.) purchased by families benefitting from rural electrification subprojects.&#13;
Therefore, the study would evaluate the aggregate impact of the project at the State and&#13;
municipal levels, measuring: (a) the savings permitted by the project, in terms of&#13;
expenditures for water supplied by carropipa and provision of medical services, etc., that&#13;
no longer have to be made due to the project, and (b) the taxes generated by various types&#13;
of subprojects financed.&#13;
19.   As in the mid-term implementation review, the study would concentrate on&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P municipalities, where the majority of project investments would&#13;
be located, and include a small sample of PAC municipalities, consistent with the project's&#13;
investment profile. The indicators would be identified and measured during the baseline&#13;
evaluation in the first year of project implementation, and assessed in the final evaluation&#13;
at the conclusion of implementation. The impact evaluation would be carried out by&#13;
independent consultants and contracted under TORs and procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
Implementation Plan and Project Performance Indicators&#13;
20.   The implementation plan and project performance indicators for each project&#13;
component over the four-year implementation period were agreed during appraisal. Given&#13;
the demand-driven nature and flexibility of the project, these indicators will be mostly&#13;

indicative targets. They can be expected to be achieved at least in the initial year of the&#13;
project, but may well develop somewhat differently in subsequent years, particularly in&#13;
terms of the proportion that each main category of subprojects (infrastructure, social or&#13;
productive) would represent out of the total investments financed by the project.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PIAUI&#13;
J. PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
1.    The principal role of project supervision is to ensure that project implementation&#13;
follows the guidelines set forth in the Loan Agreement and detailed in the Operational&#13;
Manual. At the operational level, project supervision arrangements are designed to&#13;
provide essential information on the general performance of the project and the feedback&#13;
necessary for managerial decision-making. Information collected regularly from the field&#13;
during project implementation will provide the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) with the&#13;
tools necessary to: (a) identify and correct departures from project guidelines; (b)&#13;
reinforce targeting mechanisms; (c) modify technical assistance strategies; and (d) identify&#13;
training needs.&#13;
2.    Supervision Responsibilities. In line with the decentralized implementation of&#13;
the project, the responsibilities for project supervision at the state and local levels will&#13;
correspond to the PCU and the project Municipal Councils, respectively:&#13;
(a)   at the state level: the PCU will monitor global trends across all project&#13;
municipalities, oversee the functioning and activities of project Municipal&#13;
Councils, and supervise the portfolio of subprojects under the PAC&#13;
subprogram; and&#13;
(b)   at the local level: the project Municipal Councils will monitor the&#13;
performance of the subproject portfolio under the FUMAC and FUMAC-P&#13;
subprograms.&#13;
3.    At the state level, the PCU's responsibilities include: (i) monitor the quality of&#13;
global project implementation and administration; (ii) assess community participation in&#13;
the identification, preparation and execution of PAC subprojects, as well as the quality of&#13;
technical assistance provided to beneficiary communities in PAC; (iii) collect and verify&#13;
pertinent information on the project and subprojects for the MIS; and (iv) review the&#13;
activities of the FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils.&#13;
4.    Supervision of the project Municipal Councils by the PCU will focus on the&#13;
following points: (i) the composition of the Councils to ensure they meet the required&#13;
80% beneficiary representation; (ii) the frequency and openness of the Councils' meetings;&#13;
(iii) the criteria applied to screen, prioritize and approve subproject proposals and the&#13;
effectiveness of targeting of project benefits to the poorest communities; and (iv) the&#13;
capacity of the Councils to provide technical assistance to the beneficiary communities.&#13;
In addition to these points, supervision of the FUMAC-P Councils will focus on whether&#13;
the administrative and financial arrangements made by these Councils are effective in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

managing and releasing subproject funds to the community associations as well as&#13;
progress in the implementation of POAs agreed for each FUMAC-P Council.&#13;
5.    At the local level, the Municipal Councils, with support from the PCU, will carry&#13;
out the following supervision tasks in their respective municipalities: (i) verification of the&#13;
status and quality of subproject implementation; (ii) assessment of community&#13;
participation in the identification, preparation and execution of subprojects; (iii) evaluation&#13;
of the extent to which communities are organized to effectively undertake the operation&#13;
and maintenance of the investments, following, in the case of productive subprojects, the&#13;
appropriate regulamentos de uso; (iv) identification of technical assistance and ef training&#13;
needs; and (v) assessment of effectiveness of targeting of project benefits and&#13;
identification of potential beneficiary communities not yet participating in the project. In&#13;
addition to these tasks, FUMAC-P Councils will follow-up on compliance by beneficiary&#13;
associations with subproject agreements signed with them.&#13;
6.    To fulfill their supervision responsibilities, given the number of subprojects in the&#13;
field and the amount of information to collect, both the PCU and the project Municipal&#13;
Councils may delegate some supervision tasks to selected NGOs and participating public&#13;
agencies (e.g., EMATER), according to specific terms of reference developed for this&#13;
purpose. This assistance would be especially useful for evaluating the status of&#13;
community organization and mobilization. In addition, to facilitate the supervision of&#13;
individual subprojects under implementation, the PCU and the Municipal Councils would&#13;
liaise with the Subproject Supervision and Control Committees (Annex D) --community&#13;
members designated to supervise each subproject and control the status and quality of&#13;
subproject implementation. Whether carried out by the PCU, Municipal Councils or a&#13;
partner organization, subprojects would receive two supervision visits in their first year of&#13;
implementation and, in the case of productive subprojects and water supply subprojects, at&#13;
least one visit per year thereafter.&#13;
7.    Supervision Reporting. Inforrnation collected during supervision, including&#13;
indicators of subproject implementation performance and the identification of the principal&#13;
bottlenecks or problems, will be incorporated into the subproject standard data sheets (see&#13;
Annex H) and included in the MIS, maintained by the PCU. To aid the overall&#13;
information collection process between the state and local levels, the project Municipal&#13;
Councils will report regularly to the PCU on the implementation of the subprojects in their&#13;
respective municipalities. The contents and frequency of these reports would be&#13;
determined by the PCU and included in the Operational Manual. Based on the project and&#13;
subproject information collected at the state and local levels, the PCU will prepare and&#13;
submit to the Bank mid-year and annual reports on the overall physical and financial status&#13;
of project implementation and performance. In addition, the PCU will present the Annual&#13;
Operating Plan (POA) and corresponding budget for each subsequent fiscal year of&#13;
implementation to the Bank for its review and comment.&#13;
&#13;

8.    World Bank Supervision. In keeping with the decentralized implementation of&#13;
the project, and based on the experience under the reformulated NRDP, the Bank will&#13;
continue its decentralized supervision of the project. The Bank will carry out at least two&#13;
regular supervision missions per year from its field office in Recife. Regular supervision&#13;
will entail: (i) a discussion of project implementation problems identified by the PCU&#13;
and/or Municipal Councils; (ii) field visits to a random sample of community subprojects;&#13;
and (iii) a review of the performance of all project components, and particularly an&#13;
assessment of the FUMAC-P pilot subprogram, to address problems and make appropriate&#13;
recommendations. In addition, based on frequent communication with the PCU, the&#13;
Recife Office will conduct short supervision missions to address problems which require&#13;
prompt action. Also, in view of the diversity of community subprojects, consultants of&#13;
different expertise would be contracted to provide occasional input and advice to Bank&#13;
missions. Two full supervision reports will be issued annually, as well as Back-to-Office&#13;
reports for each short supervision mission. It is estimated that about 28 staff-weeks will&#13;
be required for project supervision, or about 7 staff-weeks annually during the four years&#13;
of project implementation.&#13;
9.    The schedule of project supervision is as follows:&#13;
(a)   by July 31 and January 31 of each year, presentation of mid-year and&#13;
annual reports from the PCU to the Bank;&#13;
(b)   by February and September of each year, full Bank supervision missions&#13;
completed; and&#13;
(c)   by October 30 of each year, presentation of the POA for the subsequent&#13;
year to the Bank for review and comment by November 15.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation
            Project will assist the state Government of Piaui to
            alleviate rural poverty and its consequences by: a)
            providing basic social and economic infrastructure and
            employment and income generating opportunities for the rural
            poor; b) decentralizing resource allocation and decision
            making to local levels; c) providing a safety net for the
            rural poor during a period of macroeconomic reform and
            fiscal adjustment; and d) leveraging resources mobilized at
            community and municipal levels.  The project will include
            three main components: a) community subprojects, to support
            small-scale investments selected, operated and maintained by
            the beneficiaries; b) institutional development, to provide
            entities and communities with technical assistance and
            training to increase capacity and improve project
            implementation; and c) project administration, supervision,
            monitoring and evaluation, to finance project coordination
            and activities to provide project performance and impact feedback.
