An eager young generation stands poised on the threshold of&#13;
a new era.Throughout the developing world, the same questions&#13;
resound. Will these children complete school? Will they be&#13;
healthy? Will their environment be corruptton-free, law-abiding,&#13;
and peaceful' Will the girls among them enjoy the same&#13;
opportunities as their brothers? The new millennium offers a&#13;
unique chance-and challenge-for the world to come together&#13;
in shaping the destinies of this new generation For the World&#13;
Bank, it means a renewed commitment to improving the lives&#13;
of people and the prospects for children everywhere.&#13;
Partnerships-with governments, civil society, private sector,&#13;
and other development agencies-will be vital to progress&#13;
Development is multidimensional, and forging strong parnerships&#13;
to jointly tackle a holistic development agenda is, more and&#13;
more, at the heart of all Bank assistance, as seen in the pages&#13;
of this Annual Report.&#13;

risks of contagion-in the Latin America and Caribbean&#13;
and the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Regions.&#13;
* Nearly all lending to the Africa Region ($2.1 billion) was&#13;
from IDA. South Asia, too, relied heavily (71 percent) on&#13;
IBRD and IDA Lending by Region                       IDA. These two regions alone accounted for close to 60&#13;

IN THE YEAR UNDER REVIEW:&#13;
*  New lending rose slightly above last year's record, as the Bank helped countries in crisis&#13;
undertake vital economic and financial reforms while dealing with the harsh social conse-&#13;
quences of the global crisis.&#13;
*  About 83 percent of total IDA commitments went to countries with a 1998 GNP per capita&#13;
of less than $761.&#13;
*  The Twelfth Replenishment of IDA was agreed in November 1998, providing for&#13;
SDR 8.6 billion in new donor funding for FYOO-02.&#13;
*  About a dozen countries began to pilot the Comprehensive Development Framework,&#13;
a country-owned, holistic approach to development based on partnerships and focused&#13;
on results.&#13;
*  The Economic Development Institute was expanded to become the World Bank Institute,&#13;
in a move to maximize synergies between internal and external knowledge-sharing.&#13;

THE WORLD BANK GROUP                                       THE IBRD, IDA, IFC,&#13;
MIGA, AND ICSID&#13;
The World Bank Group consists of five closely associated institutions. References in this report&#13;
to the World Bank or the Bank refer to two of these institutions: the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). The&#13;
World Bank's purpose is to reduce poverty and improve living standards for people in the develop-&#13;
ing world. The Bank provides loans ("credits" in the case of IDA), policy advice based on economic&#13;
and sector analytical work, technical assistance, and increasingly, knowledge-sharing services to its&#13;
client countries. Closely associated with the World Bank are three other institutions: IFC, IMIGA, and&#13;
ICSID. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) works closely with private investors and provides&#13;
capital to commercial enterprises in developing countries. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee&#13;
Agency (MIGA) encourages direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering insurance&#13;
against noncommercial risk. The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)&#13;
provides facilities for settling disputes between foreign investors and their host countries.&#13;

Our Annual Report is always an oppor-&#13;
tunity to pause and take a good, hard&#13;
look at where we have been, what we&#13;
ihave learned, and where we should be&#13;
going. This year, all the more so. As the&#13;
special moment of passage that is the&#13;
new millennium approaches, we are&#13;
more than usually challenged to con-&#13;
front our future with a better under-&#13;
standing of our past. We must invigorate&#13;
this special moment with an exceptional&#13;
clarity of mission.&#13;
It is two years since the financial crisis&#13;
of the late 1 990s began in East Asia.&#13;
Since I last reported to you, we have&#13;
confronted further dangers in Russia and&#13;
in Brazil. Now there are signs of recov-&#13;
ery in a number of countries, some of&#13;
them remarkable. Elsewhere, the pain&#13;
_A .;                    lingers on. If we can harness the energies&#13;
of lessons learned in this tough class-&#13;
room of crisis, I am optimistic that we&#13;
will deal more effectively with such&#13;
-                   _              challenges in the future.&#13;
Most important, what we call the&#13;
Daughters' Day at the World Bank, April 1999   "financial crisis" is now understood to&#13;
go far beyond that. At the core of the&#13;
various crises have been the very structural and social building blocks of society and, of&#13;
course, bearing the brunt of these crises have been the millions of citizens who found no&#13;
refu-ge. Institutional and governance reform and the provision of some harbor for the most&#13;
vulnerable have been central to the Bank's work of the past 1 2 months. Crisis has changed&#13;
and challenged the very way in which we work and the instruments and necessary flexibil-&#13;
ity we have to do that work. And we have been flexible: the Bank has developed new lend-&#13;
ing approaches, and our levels of efficiency and quality are up, as you will read in the pages&#13;
of this report.&#13;
Crisis has also alerted us to focus intently on the inter-relatedness of policy and structure,&#13;
and people. I am quite convinced that wNe wwill not get one right without the other. And this&#13;
is clearly true at all levels of society. The Comprehensive Development Framework that we&#13;
are piloting is the Bank's vision of how we might take this understanding forward. It is a&#13;
formulation that stresses partnership, shared goals, and an integrated approach to what&#13;
needs to be done. In the driving seat of both developing and implementing this agenda&#13;

BOX 1 GLOBAL POVERTY: STALLED PROGRESS&#13;
The financial turmoil of the last two years has dealt a blow to the expectations we had for reduc-&#13;
ing poverty. Just a short time ago, we had confidence that the International Development Goal of&#13;
halving poverty would be met in the next 20 years in most areas of the world. Today, countries that&#13;
until recently believed they had tumed the tide in the fight against poverty are witnessing its re-&#13;
emergence along with hunger and the human suffering it brings.... We must now draw on the les-&#13;
sons of recent experience to help us reshape our strategies for the future.&#13;
World Bank Group President&#13;
James D. Wolfensohn&#13;
The share of people living on less than $1 per day (at 1985 purchasing power parity) fell slightly, to&#13;
29 percent of the developing world's population, between 1987 and 1993 (the latest year for which a global&#13;
total is available). The numbers of poor, however, rose. As of 1993, the South Asia Region had the most poor&#13;
(515 million persons or 39 percent of the total). The last two decades (to the mid-I 990s) saw an extraordi-&#13;
nary decline in poverty in East Asia, from some 60 percent to 20 percent of the population (and a halving of&#13;
the numbers). Further dramatic improvement was recorded in China in the late 1990s. But much of the rest&#13;
of East Asia has seen partial reversals, takingpoverty rates back to levels experienced earlier in the 1990s.&#13;
The overall picture is one of stalled progress:&#13;
* Poverty is on the rise&#13;
-340 million poor in India in the mid- I 990s vs. 300 million in the late 1980s&#13;
-sharp worsening in Europe and Central Asia region&#13;
-continued growth in number of poor people in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
-an increase in the incidence of poverty in Indonesia of about 10 percent since 1997&#13;
* Inequality is on the rise&#13;
-Rising world inequality has been mainly driven by inter-country differences&#13;
-Inequality in some former Soviet Union countries has worsened significantly since the transition&#13;
-Rising inequality in countries as diverse as Bangladesh, China, Malaysia, and Thailand&#13;
* Urban areas will account for a rising share of the poor&#13;
* Life expectancy gains are at risk&#13;
-Having risen from 55 to 65 years between 1970 and 1997, since 1990 life expectancy has declined&#13;
in 33 countries, mostly related to AIDS. Two thirds of 33 million infected are in Africa.&#13;
&gt; Education is much worse for the poor&#13;
-There are often enormous gaps within countries between the educational attainment of the rich and the&#13;
poor. In India, for example, 15-19 year-olds from the richest 20 percent of households have completed on&#13;
average 10 years of schooling, compared with no schoolingfor children from the poorest 40 percent of&#13;
households.&#13;
Note: The World Development Report 2000/2001 on poverty and development, to be issued in September&#13;
2000, will present a major synthesis of poverty trends and underlying determinants of poverty reduction while&#13;
outlining an updated poverty-reduction strategy that reflects the lessons of recent experience.&#13;

TABLE 1 WORLD BANK LENDING BY SECTOR, FISCAL YEARS 1990-99&#13;
(millions of US. dollars)&#13;
Explanatory Note: Beginning with this year's Annual Report, sector lending data are being reclassified, to ensure&#13;
greater transparency in reporting the use of funds. Whereas the original classification assigned each loan approved to&#13;
a single (primary) sector, the reclassification classifies lending on the basis of project components. The change reflects&#13;
the evolution in the nature of Bank lending. Ten years ago a coal industry restructuring project, for example, would&#13;
have included mostly coal-sector activities; today such a project could well include environmental, financial, private&#13;
sector, social, and employee retraining aspects, all combined within a multisector-typically adjustment-loan.&#13;
Multisector lending has especially grown in the last year, as efforts to deal with macro-flnancial crises have sought to&#13;
address not only economic management issues but also needs in the financial, corporate, and social sectors. Reclassi-&#13;
fied data capture these individual elements. Thus, total lending for Social Protection in FY99 is no longer shown as&#13;
the sum of all projects classified under Social Protection ($2.7 billion under the original classification), but as the&#13;
sum of all Social Protection components across all projects ($3.6 billion as reclassified), regardless of these projects'&#13;
primary sector classification.&#13;

Figures are based on a desk review of project appraisal documentsforprojects approved by the board at the end of thefiscal&#13;
year. As such, they often reflect intended involvement of NGOs and community-based organizations, as well as actual&#13;
participation in the project design. The extent to which intended or sustained involvement of NGOs actually occurs during later&#13;
stages of the project is not yet known. Moreover, the quality of participation can vary considerably, ranging from quick&#13;
consultative meetings to major responsibility for implementation and monitoring of project components.&#13;

mance. In exceptionzal circumstances, mtI extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are&#13;
undertaking major adjustmient efforts but are not creditworthy for IERD lending. An exception has also been made for small island econ-&#13;
omies (see below).&#13;
d. During the ito.- 12 period (FYOO-02), an exception to the GNP per capita operational cutofffor IDA eligibility ($895 for FY00) has been&#13;
mnade for some snmall islandii economies, which otherzvise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack cred-&#13;
itZforthiness. For such countries, IDAm funding is considered case by case for the financing of projects and adjustment programs designed&#13;
to strengthen creditivorthiness.&#13;

NOTE: Countries eligible to borrow from IBRD and IDA are listed in Appendix 6. For consistency of comparison, the Republic of Korea is&#13;
included as a country eligible to borrow for all periods covered by this table. The Republic of Korea became eligible to borrow in Decem-&#13;
ber 1997. Amounts may not add to totals because of rounding.&#13;
a. Amounts exclude disbursements for debt reduction and net advance disbursements. Amounts also exclude disbursements for struc-&#13;
tural and sectoral adjustment loans and hybrids (loans that support policy and institutional reforms in a specific sector by financing&#13;
both a policy component disbursed against imports and an investment component), and disbursements under Hnrc Debt Initiative&#13;
grants.&#13;
b. Percentages are based on the dollar amounts shown under the total disbursements section. These percentages show both the break-&#13;
down between countries eligible to borrow from the iBRD and/or IDA, and countries not eligible to borrow, for individual goods categories&#13;
and the share of each goods category compared with total disbursements.&#13;

a.  Average Maturity - Multicurrency loans. IBRD maintains a targeted currency composition in its multicurrency loans. The&#13;
present target ratio is one U.S. dollarfor every 125 Japanese yen and one euro. These three major currencies comprise at least 90%&#13;
of the multicurrency loans' U.S. dollar equivalent value, with the remainder in other currencies. This ratio was changed in January&#13;
1999 as a result of the introduction of the euro. The composition of the multicurrency loans is affected by the selection of currencies&#13;
for disbursements on those loans and by the currencies selected for the billing of the principal repayments. Along with the selection of&#13;
disbursement currencies, IBRD manages the selection of repayment currencies to maintain the alignment of the multicurrency loans'&#13;
composition with the target ratio. The selection of currencies for repayment billing by IBRD precludes the determination of average&#13;
maturity information for multicurrency loans by individual currency. Accordingly, IBRD only discloses the maturity periods for its&#13;
multicurrency loans on a combined U.S. dollars equivalent basis.&#13;
b.  Average Maturity - Single Currency Pools. Each single currency pool reflected the composition of the multicurrency pool at incep-&#13;
tion, but at June 30, 1999 all of the Single Currency Pools had reached a level of at least 90% in the designated currency. The cur-&#13;
rency composition of these single currency pools is affected by IBRD's management of the selection of repayment currencies to the&#13;
extent non-designated currencies remaining in these pools are selected for repayment. This varying selection of currencies for repay-&#13;
ment precludes the determination of average maturity information for the single currency pools loans by individual currencies.&#13;
Accordingly, IBRD only discloses the maturity periods for its single currency pool loans on a combined U. S. dollar equivalent basis.&#13;
c.  Excludes effects of any waivers of loan interest.&#13;
d.  Effective January 1, 1999, the euro was introduced. For reporting purposes, amounts in the eleven national currencies that are con-&#13;
sidered sub-units of the euro have been aggregated with the euro and reported as euro in both the current and prior year.&#13;

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the International Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development as of June 30, 1999 and 1998, including the summary statement of loans and&#13;
the statement of subscriptions to capital stock and voting power as of June 30, 1999, and the&#13;
related statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in retained earnings, and cash&#13;
flows for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 1999. These financial&#13;
statements are the responsibility of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's&#13;
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on&#13;
our audits. The financial statements of the International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 were audited by other auditors whose&#13;
report, dated July 28, 1997, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United&#13;
States of America and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan&#13;
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are&#13;
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting&#13;
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the&#13;
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating&#13;
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable&#13;
basis for our opinion.&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial&#13;
position of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as of June 30, 1999 and&#13;
1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two fiscal years in the&#13;
period ended June 30, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the&#13;

We have audited the accompanying special purpose statements of sources and applications of development&#13;
resources of the International Development Association as of June 30, 1999 and 1998, including the&#13;
summary statement of development credits and statement of voting power, and subscriptions and&#13;
contributions as of June 30, 1999, and the related special purpose statements of changes in resources used&#13;
for heavily indebted poor countries debt initiative, changes in cumulative translation adjustment on&#13;
development credits, changes in accumulated surplus, and cash flows for each of the two fiscal years in the&#13;
period ended June 30, 1999. These special purpose financial statements are the responsibility of the&#13;
International Development Association's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these&#13;
special purpose fnancial statements based on our audits. The special purpose financial statements for the&#13;
International Development Association for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 were audited by other&#13;
auditors whose report, dated July 28, 1997, expressed an unqualified opinion on those special purpose&#13;
statements and included an explanatory paragraph which described the basis of accounting discussed in&#13;
Note A to the special purpose financial statements.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of&#13;
America and Intemational Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the&#13;
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the fmancial statements are free of material&#13;
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and&#13;
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and&#13;
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement&#13;
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
The accompanying special purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and&#13;
applications of development resources, operations, and cash flows of the International Development&#13;
Association to comply with Article VI, Section I I(a) of the Articles of Agreement of the International&#13;
Development Association, as discussed in Note A to the special purpose financial statements, and are not&#13;
intended to be a presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United&#13;
States of America or Intemational Accounting Standards.&#13;
In our opinion, such special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material&#13;
respects, the sources and applications of development resources of the International Development&#13;
Association as of June 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the&#13;
two fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 1999 in conformity with the accounting principles described&#13;

President and Board of Governors&#13;

as Administrator of the Interim Trust Fund&#13;
We have audited the accompanying special purpose statements of sources and applications of development&#13;
resources of the Interim Trust Fund as of June 30, 1999 and 1998, including the summary statement of&#13;
interim fund credits and statement of contributions as of June 30, 1999, and the related special purpose&#13;
statements of changes in cumulative translation adjustment on interim fund credits, changes in accumulated&#13;
surplus, and cash flows for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 1999. These special&#13;
purpose financial statements are the responsibility of the International Development Association's&#13;
management as Administrator of the Interim Trust Fund. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on&#13;
these special purpose financial statements based on our audits. The special purpose financial statements for&#13;
the Interim Trust Fund for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 were audited by other auditors whose report,&#13;
dated July 28, 1997, expressed an unqualified opinion on those special purpose statements and included an&#13;
explanatory paragraph which described the basis of accounting discussed in Note A to the special purpose&#13;
financial statements.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of&#13;
America and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the&#13;
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material&#13;
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and&#13;
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and&#13;
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement&#13;
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
The accompanying special purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and&#13;
applications of development resources, operations, and cash flows of the Interim Trust Fund to comply with&#13;
Article VI, Section I I(a) of the Articles of Agreement of the Intemational Development Association, as&#13;
discussed in Note A to the special purpose financial statements, and are not intended to be a presentation in&#13;
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America or International&#13;
Accounting Standards.&#13;
In our opinion, such special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material&#13;
respects, the sources and applications of development resources of the Interim Trust Fund as of June 30,&#13;
1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two fiscal years in the&#13;
period ended June 30, 1999 in conformity with the accounting principles described in Note A to the special&#13;
purpose fmancial statements.&#13;
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Governors, the International&#13;
Development Association's management as Adrrministrator of the Interim Trust Fund, and contributors to&#13;
and borrowers from the Interim Trust Fund. However, under the International Development Association's&#13;
Board of Governors' resolution establishing the Interim Trust Fund, this report is included in the Annual&#13;
Report of the Executive Directors to the Board of Governors of the International Development Association&#13;
and is therefore a matter of public record and its distribution is not limited.&#13;

            The World Bank annual report 1999
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This annual report, covering July 1,
            1998 to July 30, 1999, chronicles the World Bank's
            response to the formidable global challenges it confronted
            in the wake of the financial crisis in East Asia. The Bank
            has stretched itself to new boundaries to respond rapidly
            and in a manner commensurate with the wide-ranging emergency
            and long-term needs meeting country demand for finance and
            expertise, and focusing on basic human needs as well as
            investor needs as a basis for strong growth. Underlying all
            the Bank's activities in FY99 are the common threads of
            change, flexibility, and partnership to serve clients
            better, best captured in the piloting of the Comprehensive
            Development Framework (CDF). This process recognizes the
            importance of macroeconomic fundamentals but gives equal
            weight to the institutional, structural, and social
            underpinnings of a robust market economy. It is a
            country-owned, holistic approach based on a long-term vision
            and strong partnerships focused on results. In the short
            run, the CDF establishes mechanisms to build consensus,
            forges stronger partnerships that allow for strategic
            selectivity, reduces wasteful competition, and emphasizes
            concrete results. In the long run, the CDF enhances
            development effectiveness and contributes toward the central
            goal of poverty reduction and reaching agreed targets. This
            report details Bank operations country by country and region
            by region, threading in thematic perspectives and
            spotlighting crisis interventions.
