This project has been developed with the financial support of the Fondo EspaÃ±ol para AmÃ©rica Latina y el Caribe (SFLAC) and&#13;
Water Partnership Progam (WPP), in cooperation with CONAGUA. Its content was developed during a technical assistance proj-&#13;
ect for CONAGUA, which generated a dialogue over the course of two years of work. A number of workshops and seminars were&#13;
held in 2011 and 2012 to discuss the different parts of this project and to further debate on the issue in Mexico. This report was&#13;
prepared with the participation of Enrique Aguilar Amilpa (Consultant), Eduardo GarcÃ­a-LÃ³pez Loaeza (Consultant), and Pilar&#13;
Arronte (Consultant), under the supervision and guidance of Alessandra Campanaro (Senior Infrastructure Finance Specialist)&#13;
and Diego Juan RodrÃ­guez (Senior Economist) from the World Bank. Monica McDonough (Urban Analyst) and Alex Serrano&#13;
(Environmental Analyst) from the World Bank supported the efforts to consolidate this version and incorporated comments&#13;
from the client. Comments were also received from Javier Zuleta (Water Resources Management Senior Specialist), Cecilia&#13;
BriceÃ±o Garmendia (Lead Economist), and Luis Ernesto Garcia (Senior Hydrology Specialist).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T&#13;
       he main objective of this report is to contribute towards the formulation of&#13;
       a coordinated vision for Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Financial System for Water (Sistema de&#13;
       Financiamiento del Agua or SFA) by laying down definitions, a conceptual&#13;
framework, and a set of concrete proposals and recommendations that will allow&#13;
the SFA to operate effectively under the leadership of the National Water Com-&#13;
mission (ComisiÃ³n Nacional del Agua or CONAGUA) and with the support of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SecretarÃ­a de Hacienda y CrÃ©dito PÃºblico or&#13;
SHCP). The importance of addressing this issue from a medium- and long-term&#13;
perspective stems from the need to understand the growing challenges faced&#13;
by Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s water sector as an engine of economic development and poverty&#13;
alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The water sector in Mexico faces many challenges and properly addressing them requires an&#13;
analysis of the financing sources available for the sector and of their viability as a tool to reach the&#13;
sectorâ&#128;&#153;s objectives. This analysis should be embedded in a model of integrated water management to&#13;
ensure the rational use of water at local and regional levels. Against this backdrop, formalizing the SFA&#13;
is seen as a means to integrated management of water resources rather than an end in itself.&#13;
    This report presents a proposal to formalize the concept of an SFA supported by the World Bank,&#13;
providing CONAGUA with solid conceptual foundations, and offering suggestions to achieve the stra-&#13;
tegic coordination of the flow of financial resources towards the water sector. The next step to this&#13;
report would be to formalize the SFA, and then devise a financial strategy and implementation tools.&#13;
    The report examines the SFA through basic concepts and its current legal framework, and defines&#13;
the SFA as follows: â&#128;&#156;A subsystem of the Mexican financial system composed of (public, private, and&#13;
social) institutions that channel resources from different financing sources (public and private) to the&#13;
various (public, private, and social) programs and investment projects aimed at the development and&#13;
management of water resources and associated water systems; these financial resources are chan-&#13;
neled through a range of instruments and mechanisms, in accordance with relevant legislation and&#13;
regulations, and taking into account sustainability, economic efficiency, and equity criteria.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

&#13;
             Given the above definition, this report         vided different sources of financing are tapped&#13;
         reviews the existing instruments and mecha-         to reach the medium- and long-term objectives&#13;
         nisms that provide and could provide access         of this sector. Given the variety and complexity of&#13;
         to various sources of financing. These include      financial mechanisms for water, the formalization&#13;
         fiscal funds from the federal government and        of the SFA is seen as an instrument of coordina-&#13;
         resources from state and municipal govern-          tion and support that will increase the efficiency&#13;
         ments; federal contributions to state and munici-   and effectiveness of the use of public resources;&#13;

        he abundance of financial resources that characterized the second half of&#13;
        the 1970s and early 1980s, originating in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s rise as an oil power,&#13;
        and the relatively large supply of external credit, made it possible to sig-&#13;
nificantly extend the countryâ&#128;&#153;s water infrastructure. Among other things, the total&#13;
irrigated area was expanded and existing irrigation systems were rehabilitated; the&#13;
development of the humid tropics was given a boost; and several bulk water sup-&#13;
ply systems were built for urban centers and industrial ports. However, changes&#13;
in the financial conditions, severely affected investments and operations and&#13;
maintenance of water infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In the late 1980s, the overreliance on fiscal resources for the development of water programs&#13;
further exacerbated its financial problems. Aside from funding provided by international development&#13;
banksâ&#128;&#148;by then already limitedâ&#128;&#148;no other funding sources were available. The sectors that benefited&#13;
the most from the water works and associated services as well as the benefiting state and municipal&#13;
governments were encouraged to shoulder a larger share of the burden, but with limited success.&#13;
The declining revenue from service charges for water supply and sanitation services, the low service&#13;
tariffs in relation to total costs (mainly covering the cost of operations and maintenance), and the cost&#13;
of irrigation services in certain agricultural areas strained the federal governmentâ&#128;&#153;s limited resources.&#13;
     In 1986, the LFD introduced a set of fiscal reforms that included charges for the exploitation, use, or&#13;
usufruct4 of the nationÂ´s water resources and their inherent public goods.5 However, the lack of clarity of&#13;
the new regulations, along with the delay in updating the charges on water rights6, limited the financial&#13;
resources collected in real terms. In 1990, the Contribution to Improvements in Public Water Infrastructure&#13;

   Usufruct is the legal right to use and enjoy the fruits or profits of something belonging to another person or held in&#13;
common ownership.&#13;
5â&#128;&#131;&#13;
   Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution states that all surface and groundwater, except water that flows through a&#13;
single property or lies beneath one, belongs to the Nation. It also lists the â&#128;&#156;national waters,â&#128;&#157; which include territorial&#13;
seas, lagoons, lakes, rivers and their tributaries, etc. The â&#128;&#156;inherent public goodsâ&#128;&#157; refer to so-called federal zones (land&#13;
close to waters) and sand and gravel found in river beds.&#13;

   While there is no universally agreed definition of a water right, it is usually understood to be a legal right to withdraw&#13;
and use a quantity of water from a natural source such as a river, stream or aquifer.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12; Part 1: Background and Concepts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
M&#13;
          exicoâ&#128;&#153;s water sector is currently facing a severe crisis, despite the substan-&#13;
          tial increase in investment funds allocated to it. This crisis is character-&#13;
          ized, among other things, by an increase in the number of overexploited&#13;
aquifers; the deterioration of the quality of water in rivers and other water bodies;&#13;
the increase in the number of conflicts over water; the growth in the coverage of&#13;
water supply and sanitation services, be it with services that are inefficient and of&#13;
relatively low quality; and the hidden threat to dams and other important water&#13;
infrastructure, in light of extreme hydro-meteorological events that are becoming&#13;
more frequent and intense.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The current crisis is very likely to escalate if corrective measures are not taken. In essence,&#13;
it is necessary to tackle a series of weaknesses that afflict the entire sector, among others, the low&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of the numerous investment projects and programs that operate in an&#13;
uncoordinated manner. This lack of coordination, in turn, has led to overlapping programs, inefficient&#13;
use of public resources, and a lack of comprehensive policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Financial Challenge&#13;
&#13;
Analyses of possible future scenarios suggest that in order to successfully address the future chal-&#13;
lenges in water, an annual investment of over Mex$50 billion will be necessary over the next 20&#13;
years.13 The most likely scenario corrected for the climate change impact would increase the gap&#13;
between supply and demand of water by 58 percent, which would require additional annual invest-&#13;
ments of Mex$12 billion a year. Other estimates (for example, FernÃ¡ndez, 2011) show that the above&#13;
figures could be on the low side if the financial requirements to rehabilitate and/or replace the existing&#13;
infrastructure, and the costs of addressing extreme events, in particular floods, are also taken into&#13;
account.&#13;

&amp;#12;    STRENGTHENING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM FOR WATER IN MEXICO:&#13;
2   FROM A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO THE FORMULATION OF PILOT INITIATIVES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Given the financial limitations of the public sector, which even under the most optimistic scenarios&#13;
         would not be able to allocate substantially more resources to the water sector, it is evident that the&#13;
         investments required are considerable. Financing these investments will require resources from dif-&#13;
         ferent sources. At present, the financial resource mix appears to rely excessively and increasingly on&#13;
         taxpayers, something that is definitely not sustainable and should be corrected; the funding provided by&#13;
         users should be increased significantly.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                             Chapter 1&#13;
                                                                              Starting Point&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.1â&#128;&#130; Legal Foundations of the SFA&#13;
&#13;
The amendments and additions to the 1992 National Water Act (Ley de Aguas Nacionales or LAN),&#13;
which took effect in 2004, include the Title Eight Bis (TÃ­tulo Octavo Bis), consisting of a single chapter&#13;
entitled â&#128;&#156;The Financial System for Waterâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
      Article 111 Bis of the LAN provides the legal basis for the creation of an SFA. In fact, the third&#13;
paragraph of this article clearly establishes what is expected of the SFA. Article 112 of the LAN has&#13;
been aligned with the provisions of the LFD regarding the payment obligations of the users of national&#13;
waters, for the exploitation, use or usufruct of such waters and their inherent public goodsâ&#128;&#148;bodies&#13;
of water that are used for the discharge of wastewater. Thus, by charging levies for water use, article&#13;
112 Bis to a large extent sustains the funding of actions and programs undertaken by the water sector&#13;
to reach its medium- and long-term objectives.14&#13;
      Even if the provisions of the LAN are confined to â&#128;&#156;the rates of the levies charged for the water&#13;
use as well as other federal taxes and tariffs established for the use or usufruct of water, or for the&#13;
provision of services related to water infrastructure works,â&#128;&#157;15 including the contributions to partially&#13;
or totally recover the cost of federal investments in this area, the Act itself leaves open the pos-&#13;
sibility of extending the SFA to achieve a coordinated funding mix that also includes other public&#13;
and private resources (article 111 Bis, second paragraph), as is currently the case through different&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
      The challenge for the government is to make the provisions of the LAN operational and incorpo-&#13;
rate them into the various programs and projects at the federal, state, and municipal level. As stated in&#13;
the first paragraph of article 111 Bis, the federal executive shall define, create, and implement the SFA.&#13;
The fastest legal path to attaining this would be the regulation of articles 111 Bis, 112, and 112 Bis.16 This&#13;
would confer legal status on the SFA, thereby securing its long-term sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14â&#128;&#131;&#13;
    The provisions of article 112 Bis of the LAN in a way provide a solid legal argument to earmark the revenues resulting&#13;
from the provisions of the LFD on the exploitation, use, and usufruct of national waters.&#13;
15â&#128;&#131;&#13;
    Article 112 Bis of the LAN.&#13;
16â&#128;&#131;&#13;
    It is not necessary to wait until all the articles of the LAN have been implemented. The federal executive may issue&#13;
regulatory provisions regarding these three articles.&#13;

    In general, a countryâ&#128;&#153;s financial system is            legislation and regulations, and taking&#13;

with a surplus towards the borrowers or spend-              The above definition may be expanded to&#13;
ing units with a deficit. In a market economy, the   the different levels of government (state or local)&#13;
financial system plays the key role of capturing     and even to that of a private entity. For instance,&#13;
the surplus finances of savers and channeling        the concept of an SFA in the context of a state&#13;
them towards public or private borrowers.            could constitute a policy tool to duly arrange the&#13;

as well as specialists from other government         the state level, given the respective competences&#13;
institutions and water sector stakeholders, the      of the three levels of government. The LAN stipu-&#13;
following consensus was reached on the essence       lates that CONAGUA is responsible for the SFAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
of an SFA:26&#13;

   â&#128;&#156;In the context of the financial system                  Taking the above definition as its starting&#13;

Notes: (1) The general tax concept includes the proceeds from the collection of the water use and wastewater&#13;
discharge levies. (2) Water Resources Management includes all the actions necessary for the comprehensive&#13;
management of the water resources (to control water quantity and quality), as well as those necessary to preserve&#13;
vital ecosystems. (3) The resource flow derived from SFA is not static; it should be seen as a financial flow in a given&#13;
timeframe.&#13;
a&#13;
  As pointed out in figure 1, although the SFA is to a large extent linked to CONAGUAâ&#128;&#153;s sphere of competence, it should&#13;
also include the investment programs and projects related to other subsectors that use water such as the energy,&#13;
industry, and tourism sectors.&#13;

P&#13;
       rograms, projects, and activities in water are currently implemented through&#13;
       different financing mechanisms, without having to resort to an SFA. However,&#13;
       the financing is channeled through a large number of federal programs with&#13;
overlapping operating rules and eligibility criteria. Furthermore, the financing gap&#13;
is increasing so a framework to coordinate and improve the efficiency in the public&#13;
spending is required. The formalization of the SFA could contribute to improve the&#13;
abovementioned and will also ensure the compliance of the LAN. Formalizing the&#13;
SFA would facilitate the encoding of experiences and, thereby, the creation of a&#13;
permanent system for reviewing, updating, and improving the different transac-&#13;
tion mechanisms, aside from promoting the adoption of new and innovative forms&#13;
of financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The need to manage the financial arrangements for the sustainable development of water&#13;
resources and its associated services has been highlighted in a recent report by the OECD (2012),&#13;
which points out that there are several opportunities for Mexico to raise the efficiency of public&#13;
spending in the water sector. In this context, one of the aims of formalizing the SFA would be to create&#13;
an instrument that would make it easier to improve the efficiency and effectiveness, as well as the&#13;
multiplier effect of the public resources applied to the programs implemented in this sector.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
3.1â&#128;&#130; The SFA and CONAGUAâ&#128;&#153;s Scope of Competence&#13;
&#13;
According to the conceptual framework presented in Figure 2, CONAGUA coordinates the relationship&#13;
among the institutions providing financing and those demanding resources to finance their programs and&#13;
projects,48 including CONAGUA itself as administrator of the national waters. As shown in the conceptual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

    Although initially the SFA would operate in the realm of programs that are under CONAGUAâ&#128;&#153;s care (water supply and&#13;
sanitation, agricultural irrigation and drainage, flood control, and IWRM), it would be possible and desirable to extend&#13;
the concept to other sectors.&#13;

                   to organize and prioritize actions in accordance            capital investments and, in some cases, the&#13;
                   with short-, medium-, and long-term financial               grants also include subsidies for operations and&#13;
                   restrictions; (ii) the Operating Rules that include         maintenance.&#13;
                   eligibility criteria of different federal programs;              It is proposed that CONAGUAâ&#128;&#153;s current&#13;

&#13;
4.1â&#128;&#130; Background&#13;
&#13;
Water for agriculture is channeled through irrigation districts and irrigation units,50 designed to trans-&#13;
port large volumes of water to the fields under a shift-irrigation system. At present, producers who&#13;
use irrigation systems still employ practices and technologies that were adequate at one time but&#13;
nowadays are no longer acceptable due to their low efficiency, combined with the shortages of water&#13;
and conflicts over this resource.&#13;
     However, farmers are reluctant to change their current irrigation practices. The reason for&#13;
this is twofold: (i) the high cost of modernizing an irrigation system, which cannot be financed with&#13;
easily accessible credit; and (ii) the fact that mandatory water-saving and efficiency actions have&#13;
been undermined by policies that enable farmers to get their water and energy relatively cheaply.&#13;
There are just not enough business mechanisms and innovative, long-term credit instruments that&#13;
allow for a more effective financial participation of all the parties involved; moreover, the financial&#13;
participation of farmers, particularly small, will require subsidize interest rates to make the credit&#13;
affordable.&#13;
     A series of proposals and tools to optimize available resources and facilitate access to credit for&#13;
investments in the upgrading of irrigation infrastructure and plot technological upgrading will be dis-&#13;
cussed briefly. These tools, as well as the existing ones, would not be mutually exclusive: combinations&#13;
involving different mechanisms, resources, and parties can be made to create the best fit for every&#13;
specific situation or project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.2â&#128;&#130; Overview&#13;
&#13;
In rural areas, water management is usually characterized by practices that promote water to be&#13;
wasted, as well as the overexploitation of aquifers. To reverse this situation, the federal government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
50â&#128;&#131;&#13;
    The â&#128;&#156;irrigation districtsâ&#128;&#157; are areas of land linked to a principal project. The â&#128;&#156;irrigation unitsâ&#128;&#157; are systems that receive&#13;
irrigation from water sources (including wells and springs) that are somewhat dispersed. The main difference between&#13;
the two lies in their origin. The infrastructure of the irrigation units was built primarily by the federal government and&#13;
right at the start handed over to the users for its administration, and O&amp;M. While the irrigation districts were also built&#13;
by the federal government, their administration, and O&amp;M were the responsibility of the federal government until being&#13;
transferred to the users in the 1990s.&#13;

5.1â&#128;&#130; Background&#13;
&#13;
Mexico is exposed to different types of disasters. The geographic location of the country makes it&#13;
particularly vulnerable to seismic and volcanic activity, while its location in the inter-tropical region&#13;
makes it susceptible to tropical storms along the coasts of the Caribbean, the Pacific Ocean, and the&#13;
Gulf of Mexico. These tropical storms periodically affect the populations by causing strong winds and&#13;
significant amounts of rainfall, leading to severe damages and widespread flooding. CONAGUA plays a&#13;
key role in the prevention of and response to disasters caused by these extreme hydro-meteorological&#13;
events.&#13;
      According to the National Center for Disaster Prevention (Centro Nacional de PrevenciÃ³n de&#13;
Desastres or CENAPRED), in the period 1980â&#128;&#147;99, Mexico suffered 75 disasters of a significant size,&#13;
causing over 10,000 deaths (see table 4) and hundreds of thousands of victims suffered from dis-&#13;
placement and the loss of valuable assets. The cost of direct damages in that period reached US$9.6&#13;
billion, giving a yearly average of approximately US$500 million. If indirect damages are also taken into&#13;
account, that is, the interruption in the production flows of goods and services, at least another US$40&#13;
million a year would have to be added.58 Table 4 shows that the total number of fatalities caused by&#13;
hydro-meteorological phenomena is 2,767 persons. Total direct damages for these weather-related&#13;
disasters have been estimated at US$4.4 billion.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T&#13;
        he 1992 legal reform of the LAN incorporated a series of economic instru-&#13;
        ments to manage the water resources of the country in order to encourage&#13;
        a more efficient allocation and use of water. One of those instruments are&#13;
water rights and by creating the possibility of transferring the rights associated&#13;
with their respective concession titles, the LAN established a market for rights.&#13;
This is a regulated market, since third parties and water quality are invariably&#13;
affectedâ&#128;&#148;externalities that prevent the market from operating adequately when&#13;
left alone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.1â&#128;&#130; The Water Rights Market&#13;
&#13;
The basic characteristics of the water rights market, established in 1992 and amended in 2004, are&#13;
the following:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#151;&#143;â&#151;&#143;   Article 25 of the LAN states that â&#128;&#156;The concession holder may totally or partially modify the use&#13;
           of the water licensed, as long as the consumptive use established in the corresponding title is&#13;
           not altered, provided the change is final and the concession holder provides timely notice to the&#13;
           Water Authority for the purpose of updating or modifying the respective discharge permit and,&#13;
           where needed, updating the REPDA.â&#128;&#157; Authorization will always be required when changes are&#13;
           made to the consumptive use stated in the corresponding title; the point of withdrawal;59 the&#13;
           discharge site; or the volume or quality or wastewaters.â&#128;&#157;60&#13;
      â&#151;&#143;â&#151;&#143;   General provisions (articles 33 to 37 of the LAN) regulate the transfer of water rights outside&#13;
           the irrigation districts and units.&#13;
      â&#151;&#143;â&#151;&#143;   The possibility of â&#128;&#156;establishing final or temporary agencies to manage the regulated opera-&#13;
           tions of the transfer of water rights, called water banks, is defined. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s functions will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
59â&#128;&#131;&#13;
    The process of abstracting water from any source, either temporarily or permanently; most water is used for irriga-&#13;
tion or treated to be safe for consumption. Water withdrawal is also known as water abstraction or water extraction.&#13;
60â&#128;&#131;&#13;
    This is an important restriction of the free transfer of water rights, meant to ensure that the rights of third parties are&#13;
not affected nor is the quality of the water that down-stream users benefit from. It should be noted that what is set forth&#13;
in this article concerning the regulation of water right transfers has not been put in practice.&#13;

                  Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There are multiple challenges in the financing of water supply and sanitation services:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#151;&#143;â&#151;&#143;   Lack of financial viability of most water utilities. State laws proclaim the obligation to set&#13;
         tariffs that allow for full cost recovery. In practice, the tariffs, which must be approved by the&#13;
         local congresses, with some exceptions, do not fully cover real costs. Federal support, based&#13;
         on the current Operating Rules of federal supported programs, is lax when it comes to ensuring&#13;
         a proper tariff structure. The low efficiency of the water utilities substantially contribute to the&#13;
         financial deficit.&#13;
    â&#151;&#143;â&#151;&#143;   Budget Cycle of Federal Support. The existing one-year budgetary cycle imposes severe&#13;
         constraints in the design and implementation of infrastructure projects.&#13;
    â&#151;&#143;â&#151;&#143;   Competing Operating Rules of Federal Programs. The existing rules for the different federal&#13;
         programs in water supply and sanitation are not sufficiently linked to broader strategic objec-&#13;
         tives or results regarding financial efficiency and sustainability and the rules across programs&#13;
         are often with different types of requirements, some of them lax.&#13;
    â&#151;&#143;â&#151;&#143;   Lack of Solvency of the Majority of Water Utilities. The vast majority of the water utilities&#13;
         and municipalities in Mexico do not have a sufficiently high credit rating that will allow them to&#13;
         access non-public sources of funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The last challenge is the result of a complex set of institutional interactions summarized in Table 9.&#13;
For each challenge, the Table depicts, using Harvey Balls, the respective weight and responsibilities of&#13;
the main players. On a scale from 0 (white or empty Harvey Ball) to 100 percent (grey or full Harvey&#13;
Ball) the circles illustrate the relative influence that each player and framework has in making adjust-&#13;
ments to address a particular problem. The table depicts that CONAGUA has enough space to act&#13;
and improve in different areas, but other factors and players also come into play. A lack of willpower&#13;
from utilities, the existing regulatory framework, and several political factors are additional external&#13;
challenges that are not necessarily under the control of CONAGUA.&#13;
    The first salient point of this analysis is that the excessively low tariff levels are at the heart of the&#13;

 Box 1.â&#128;&#130; Tariffs and Subsidies&#13;
 The tariff policy must take into account three basic aspects: (a) the efficient cost of the service provision;&#13;
 (b) the subsidy required for the low-income population; and (c) the financing mechanism of the subsidy.&#13;
&#13;
 The tariff policy is directly linked to the financial policy. Costs that are not recovered through tariffs must&#13;
 be covered by the government through taxes and/or through the resources it receives from CONAGUA&#13;
 stemming from water use and effluent discharge fees. The amount to be paid by the government and&#13;
 CONAGUA to water utilities must be defined in advance, based on a multiannual plan that specifies the&#13;
 service goals, total costs, and the cost recovery through tariffs as well as the resources to be provided by&#13;
 the Government, which derive from taxes, duties, products, and water use.&#13;
&#13;
 The tariff must reflect, as much as possible, the total cost of the provision of water and sanitation services.&#13;
 Sometimes this is not possible due to the socio-economic conditions of some users and the high cost of&#13;
 delivering these services, above all the result of obtaining new water supply and wastewater treatment&#13;
 sources. In these cases, the federal government must define a subsidy policy in order to help the low-&#13;
 income population, together with a financing mechanism that compensates for the subsidy payments,&#13;
 and a financing policy based on taxes, aimed at paying for the investments not covered by tariffs.&#13;
&#13;
 The policy of subsidies implicit in the tariffs must be targeted exclusively at the lowest- income users.&#13;
 The identification of users who should benefit from the subsidy should be based on a detailed study of&#13;
 the socioeconomic conditions of the population. This study should include clearly defined objective and&#13;
 transparent criteria for the classification of the population, as well as reliable updating mechanisms.&#13;
 The consumptive uses of water that should receive a subsidy should coincide with the minimum level&#13;
 for subsistence and the corresponding tariff charged should be enough to at least cover operational&#13;
 costs and service maintenance. Some practical examples of identifying users who should benefit from a&#13;
 subsidy are: (i) Chile, where selection criteria are based primarily on the level of income and consumption;&#13;
 (ii) Colombia classifies users according to their housing situation and location. In both countries, the&#13;
 subsidy compensation mechanism is clearly established. In Chile subsidies are compensated with&#13;
 federal government tax resources, while in Colombia they are compensated through cross-subsidies&#13;
 and/or municipal government tax resources.&#13;
&#13;
 The implementation of the tariff policy will not succeed if it does not go hand-in-hand with mechanisms&#13;
 that provide incentives for an efficient service provision and efficient commercial management together&#13;
 with high collection, invoicing, and measurement rates.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
S&#13;
       ince its establishment in 1989, CONAGUA has promoted different policies&#13;
       to meet the financial challenges faced by the water sector given the rising&#13;
       demands resulting from a growing population and a higher rate of economic&#13;
growth. CONAGUA has gained much experience in the design and implementation&#13;
of financial instruments that would comply with the long-term vision objective in&#13;
water to achieve the sustainable and equitable management of water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Based on the experience acquired and the current legal framework, a dialogue was started with a&#13;
large number of interested parties to discuss how best to structure and implement the SFA.. As a&#13;
result of this dialogue, a conceptual framework was developed for the various components of the SFA&#13;
and CONAGUAâ&#128;&#153;s legal role in this context as derived from the LAN, which would allow formalizing and&#13;
institutionalizing the SFA in the short term. It was argued that CONAGUA has the technical and admin-&#13;
istrative capacity to add value to the experience accumulated over more than 20 years by formalizing&#13;
the SFA, through the joint efforts of its specialists and the financial and fiscal authorities. To this end, a&#13;
series of steps and actions are suggested.&#13;
    The second part of our work consisted in identifying a series of initiatives that could be incorpo-&#13;
rated into the SFA, alongside existing experiences. Two of these initiatives aim to provide additional&#13;
mechanisms to promote additional activities for the modernization and technological upgrading of&#13;
irrigation systems; two other initiatives aim to support programs in natural resources response and&#13;
prevention. These initiatives undoubtedly require further analysis, in order to determine their feasibil-&#13;
ity and a roadmap for their implementation, as well as a methodology to monitor and evaluate their&#13;
potential results and impacts.&#13;
    One of the core issues that must be addressed is the provision of additional support for the&#13;
modernization and technological upgrading of the irrigation districts and units, including the parcel&#13;
level. Despite the efforts made to date, especially through the programs and mechanisms instituted by&#13;
CONAGUA and SAGARPA, there are still inherent limitations associated with the lack and discontinuity&#13;
of budget resources, and with access to financing and producersâ&#128;&#153; guarantees. The analysis has shown&#13;
that FONAGAâ&#128;&#153;s guarantee scheme, strengthened with additional resources provided by CONAGUA,&#13;
makes financing more accessible and takes advantage of the management structure of the financial&#13;
intermediaries (especially from outside the banking sector), thereby increasing the number of secured&#13;

                   which would direct its funds to long-term            some potential pilot projects in which different&#13;
                   projects through private trust funds to be set       PPP schems could be developed and tested in&#13;

            Strengthening the financial system for
            water in Mexico : from a conceptual framework to the
            formulation of pilot initiatives
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The abundance of financial resources
            that characterized the second half of the 1970s and early
            1980s, originating in the country&#146;s rise as an oil power,
            and the relatively large supply of external credit, made it
            possible to significantly extend the country&#146;s water
            infrastructure. Among other things, the total irrigated area
            was expanded and existing irrigation systems were
            rehabilitated; the development of the humid tropics was
            given a boost; and several bulk water supply systems were
            built for urban centers and industrial ports. However,
            changes in the financial conditions, severely affected
            investments and operations and maintenance of water
            infrastructure. The main objective of this report is to
            contribute towards the formulation of a coordinated vision
            for Mexico&#146;s financial system for water (sistema de
            financiamiento del agua (SFA)) by laying down definitions, a
            conceptual framework, and a set of concrete proposals and
            recommendations that will allow the SFA to operate
            effectively under the leadership of the national water
            commission (comision nacional del agua (CONAGUA)) and with
            the support of the ministry of finance and public credit
            (secretaria de hacienda y credito publico (SHCP)). The
            importance of addressing this issue from a medium- and
            long-term perspective stems from the need to understand the
            growing challenges faced by Mexico&#146;s water sector as an
            engine of economic development and poverty alleviation.
