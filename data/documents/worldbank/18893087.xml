&amp;#12;     Box     Core Principles presenting issues for deposit insurers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    1        Core Principle 4: Powers&#13;
             A deposit insurer should have all powers necessary to fulfill its mandate and these powers should be formally specified. All deposit&#13;
             insurers require the power to finance reimbursements, enter into contracts, set internal operating budgets and procedures, and&#13;
             access timely and accurate information to ensure that they can meet their obligations to depositors promptly.&#13;
&#13;
             Core Principle 5: Governance&#13;
             The deposit insurer should be operationally independent, transparent, accountable and insulated from undue political and industry&#13;
             influence.&#13;
5&#13;
             Core Principle 6: Relationships with Other Safety-Net Participants&#13;
             A framework should be in place for the close coordination and information sharing, on a routine basis as well as in relation to&#13;
             particular banks, among the deposit insurer and other financial system safety-net participants. Such information should be accurate&#13;
             and timely (subject to confidentiality when required). Information-sharing and coordination arrangements should be formalised.&#13;
&#13;
             Core Principle 11: Funding&#13;
             A deposit insurance system should have available all funding mechanisms necessary to ensure the prompt reimbursement of&#13;
             depositorsâ&#128;&#153; claims including a means of obtaining supplementary back-up funding for liquidity purposes when required. Primary&#13;
             responsibility for paying the cost of deposit insurance should be borne by banks since they and their clients directly benefit from&#13;
             having an effective deposit insurance system.&#13;
                  For deposit insurance systems (whether ex-ante, ex-post or hybrid) utilising risk-adjusted differential premium systems, the&#13;
             criteria used in the risk-adjusted differential premium system should be transparent to all participants. As well, all necessary&#13;
             resources should be in place to administer the risk-adjusted differential premium system appropriately.&#13;
&#13;
             Core Principle 15: Early Detection and Timely Intervention and Resolution&#13;
             The deposit insurer should be part of a framework within the financial system safety net that provides for the early detection and&#13;
             timely intervention and resolution of troubled banks. The determination and recognition of when a bank is or is expected to be&#13;
             in serious financial difficulty should be made early and on the basis of well defined criteria by safety-net participants with the&#13;
             operational independence and power to act.&#13;
&#13;
             Core Principle 16: Effective Resolution Processes&#13;
             Effective failure-resolution processes should: facilitate the ability of the deposit insurer to meet its obligations including reimbursement&#13;
             of depositors promptly and accurately and on an equitable basis; minimise resolution costs and disruption of markets; maximise&#13;
             recoveries on assets; and, reinforce discipline through legal actions in cases of negligence or other wrongdoings. In addition,&#13;
             the deposit insurer or other relevant financial system safety-net participant should have the authority to establish a flexible&#13;
             mechanism to help preserve critical banking functions by facilitating the acquisition by an appropriate body of the assets and&#13;
             the assumption of the liabilities of a failed bank (e.g., providing depositors with continuous access to their funds and maintaining&#13;
             clearing and settlement activities).&#13;
&#13;
             Core Principle 17: Reimbursing Depositors&#13;
             The deposit insurance system should give depositors prompt access to their insured funds. Therefore, the deposit insurer should&#13;
             be notified or informed sufficiently in advance of the conditions under which a reimbursement may be required and be provided&#13;
             with access to depositor information in advance. Depositors should have a legal right to reimbursement up to the coverage limit&#13;
             and should know when and under what conditions the deposit insurer will start the payment process, the time frame over which&#13;

            Deposit insurance systems : what do initial
            assessments show?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Deposit insurance is increasingly being
            recognized as an important part of a country's
            financial sector safety net. Deposit insurers are using the
            core principles for effective deposit insurance systems to
            complete self-assessments to guide them in their strategic
            planning and ongoing operations. So far there have been 13
            guided self-assessments facilitated by the International
            Association of Deposit Insurers or detailed assessments
            completed through the World Bank and International Monetary
            Fund's Financial Sector Assessment Program. The results
            of these assessments show areas of particular concern for
            deposit insurers. This note references the guidance
            developed by standard setters on deposit insurance generally
            and summarizes some of the issues that have developed around
            the specific application of the core principles.
