High standards of quality result in higher costs,          I&#13;

this diversity is to  end  the  main  provider's                 sizing and placing transformers (ESMAP 2000). Single-phase                         3&#13;

Another is to permit the main provider to                     eration. However, the study emphasizes that not all con-&#13;
diversify its quality, especially since network sup-             struction savings are necessarily efficient. "An initially&#13;

However, there will sometimes be technical    istrative cost of reflecting these cost differences in&#13;

            Utility reform - regulating quality

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Privatization of infrastructure services
            is often followed by stricter enforcement of quality
            standards, which raises costs, maintaining, or worsening the
            exclusion of the poor. The poor would get easier access to
            service, if the main provider was permitted to deviate from
            this uniform standard, offering poor consumers a service in
            which an acceptable relaxation in quality, led to a lower
            price. This note reviews the legal, and technical challenges
            for quality diversification by utilities, and early results
            from efforts by some to diversify.
