PERSPECTIVES ON POVERTY AND INCOME INEQUALITY IN BRAZIL:&#13;
AN ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGES DURING THE 1970s&#13;
ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper provides some exploratory analysis of&#13;
the advance tabulations of the 1980 Brazilian demographic&#13;
census. A descriptive examination of various measures of&#13;
poverty is undertaken with comparisons made between 1970 and&#13;
1980. Computations are also made of Gini coefficients,&#13;
Theil indices, and income deciles. Changes in the overall&#13;
inequality in income distribution are not clearly&#13;
discernible between 1970 and 1980, although more&#13;
disaggregated changes, in part offsetting each other, were&#13;
identified. In general, real absolute incomes increased for&#13;
all decile groups, suggesting a reduction in poverty over&#13;
the decade of the 1970's.&#13;

I.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
In the past 20 years the Brazilian economy has experienced&#13;
substantial growth. Income per capita grew at annual average rates of 5.0%&#13;
and 4.9% during the periods 1960-70 and 1970-81, respectively, reaching a&#13;
level of about US$2,000 by 1981. The nature of this growth and the growth&#13;
process itself have been controversial, with many critics contending that&#13;
poverty and human misery have increased. At the other extreme, other&#13;
individuals extol the virtues of the so-called Brazilian model of growth,&#13;
pointing to the human benefits accompanying the growth process. This paper&#13;
attempts to shed some limited new light on an old debate with an&#13;
analysis of recently available data from the 1980 demographic census,&#13;
undertaken by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
Over the past ten years much of the debate has centered on&#13;
questions of inequality in the distribution of income. With the&#13;
availability of the 1970 demographic census materials comparisons could be&#13;
made with 1960, focusing on changes in relative poverty and the&#13;
distribution of income over time. Virtually all of these studies1/&#13;
demonstrated that relative income shares became more unequal between 1960&#13;
and 1970. The income benefits of economic growth in Brazil were seen to be&#13;
unequally distributed, with upper income groups gaining disproportionately&#13;
and the poor being left behind. While the real absolute incomes of the&#13;
poorest 40% of income earners were seen to grow modestly, if at all, the&#13;
upper income groups enjoyed substantial income increases. Considerable&#13;
controversy has existed concerning the reasons for the observed increased&#13;
income concentration. It can be noted, however, that the overall results&#13;
are consistent with an interpretation of Brazilian growth following&#13;
dualistic lines as envisaged in Lewis-Ranis-Fei type growth models. The&#13;
question since the analysis of the 1970 data has been whether the patterns&#13;
of income concentration and growth observed during the 1960's persisted&#13;
during the high growth 1970's2/. In looking towards the 1980's a better&#13;
perspective on trends and events during the 1970's appears useful.&#13;
1/ See, among others, Fishlow (1972), Langoni (1973), Hoffman and Duarte&#13;
(1972), Fonseca (1978), and Fields (1977). Other important works,&#13;
focusing on the 1970 data, include Lluch (1981, 1982), Costa (1977)&#13;
and Fox (1982).&#13;
2/ Some analysis making use of the ENDEF (the national household&#13;
budget survey) materials for 1974-75 has concluded that some&#13;
fundamental changes in fact have occurred. See Pfefferman and&#13;
Webb (1979,1982), Thomas (1982) and Knight (1981). These studies&#13;
in general attest to rather substantial progress in poverty&#13;
alleviation. Other work (e.g., Rossi, 1982) has employed income&#13;
tax return information, showing increases in inequality measures&#13;
over time presumably as the result of the inclusion of lower&#13;
relative income recipients in the income tax system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The recent publication by the Brazilian Geographic and&#13;
Statistical Institute (IBGE) of the advance tabulations from the 1980&#13;
demographic census permits a fresh look at changing patterns of poverty and&#13;
income inequality in the country with a systematic focus for the first time&#13;
on the 1970's3/. The principal question posed in this paper is what has&#13;
happened to poverty and income concentration during the decade. Has growth&#13;
brought poverty alleviation? Or has it simply continued to concentrate&#13;
incomes? And what inferences, if any, can be made about changes in social&#13;
welfare? The analysis undertaken here is viewed as preliminary in nature,&#13;
with a large number of questions raised and left unanswered. The public use&#13;
sample of the 1980 demographic census, scheduled to be available soon from&#13;
IBGE, will enable other economists to explore more fully and thoroughly&#13;
some of the questions addressed here.&#13;
Nevertheless, on the basis of information so far made available&#13;
to the public, the analysis possible, explained in this paper, produces&#13;
some rather far reaching results and conclusions. Despite persistent&#13;
poverty, during the 1970's substantial progress in reducing poverty and&#13;
improving living standards occurred. While there is some limited and weak&#13;
evidence of overall increased income concentration, growing overall&#13;
relative inequality, if it did occur, was minor and could not be fully&#13;
discerned by our measures. In addition, there were observed reductions in&#13;
income inequality among regions and among sectors. The agricultural sector&#13;
in particular, while witnessing growing income inequality within it, was&#13;
characterized by rapidly growing average incomes which served to reduce the&#13;
gap between agricultural and urban-based occupational incomes.&#13;

In Section II we present descriptive evidence on non-income&#13;
measures of poverty. Section III discusses income measures of poverty and&#13;
income inequality and contains Gini and Theil indices estimated for 1970&#13;
and 1980. Absolute and relative comparisons of decile group incomes are&#13;
also presented. Section IV provides interpretations of the results, and a&#13;
final section offers concluding remarks.&#13;
II. NON-INCOME MEASURES OF POVERTY&#13;
The 1980 demographic census continues and extends a number of&#13;
non-income measures of poverty and well-being instituted in earlier&#13;
censuses. These socio-economic indicators include computable measures of&#13;
literacy, schooling, enrollments, household size and composition, labor&#13;
force participation, access to social services, dwelling characteristics,&#13;
housing conditions, and durable consumer goods possession. Also, from the&#13;
available information, estimates can be generated regarding life expectancy&#13;
and infant mortality. Unequivocally, while one can be dissatisfied with&#13;
existing levels, all of these measures show substantial improvements during&#13;
the 1970's with real gains across the country, some reductions in the&#13;
considerable regional disparities and, generally lessened urban-rural&#13;
differences as well. Some of this information is described in the next few&#13;
pages; other data are presented in the Appendix Tables.4/&#13;
4/ Additional statistical materials, on which this paper is based,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Looking first at literacy, Table 1 demonstrates an increase in&#13;
overall literacy rates from 59.4% in 1970 to 68.7% in 1980, despite a&#13;
slight absolute increase in the number of illiterates. Each major region&#13;
showed improvement, as did both rural and urban population groupings.5/&#13;
Regional disparities were also reduced, in 1970 Northeastern literacy&#13;
was 66% of the national average; by 1980 the comparable figure had&#13;
increased to 69%.&#13;
Some information on school enrollments is presented in Table 2.&#13;
Enrollment rates at both primary and secondary school levels increased&#13;
significantly. Again, the Northeast, while lagging considerably, is seen&#13;
to have reduced the gap between its enrollment rates and those of the&#13;
country as a whole. Comparing average years of schooling of the econo-&#13;
mically active population in 1970 and 1980 yields similar results. In&#13;
addition, to be referred to later, the inequality of schooling across&#13;
individuals has decreased markedly. (Appendix Table A6)..&#13;
Table 3 presents basic information on the provision of water&#13;
supply and sewerage services. Both relate in a fundamental way to health&#13;
conditions.6/ The pattern over the decade of the 1970's has been one of&#13;
5/ Similar results are apparent with "functional" literacy rate&#13;
comparisons, where the "functional" literacy rate is defined as&#13;
the proportion of the population aged 15 years and older reporting&#13;
five or more years of formal schooling. One can note that&#13;
literacy is rather loosely defined and schooling levels and&#13;
enrollments not entirely reflective of actual educational&#13;
attainment. Yet, unless these indicators themselves have&#13;
deteriorated in their quality, improvement in the phenomena&#13;
measured by the indicators over time represents a real&#13;
improvement.&#13;
6/ One recent study (Merrick, 1982) has found a strong negative&#13;
relationship between the provision of piped water and infant&#13;
mortality across households.&#13;

catching up during the 1970's did occur.&#13;
Material progress and reduced poverty during the course of the&#13;
1970s are also reflected in the expansion of the possession by households&#13;
of durable consumer goods and services.7/ Some comparisons between 1970&#13;
1980 are presented in Appendix Table Al. Of particular interest is the&#13;
expansion in the households provided with electricity. A total of 48% of&#13;
Brazilian households in 1970 were provided with electricity; by 1980, the&#13;
proportion had increased to 67%. While rural areas are seen to still lag&#13;
considerably, substantial progress was made. Similar patterns are observed&#13;
for other durable consumer goods and services. Dramatic increases in&#13;
household possession are observed throughout the country, with some of the&#13;
greatest proportional increases being witnessed in the Northeast. For&#13;
Brazil as a whole by 1980 50% of all households possessed a refrigerator,&#13;
76% a radio, 55% a television, and 22% an automobile. These figures, and&#13;
their growth, attest to the expansion of European or American style middle&#13;
class living standards in Brazil and/or the proletarization of durable&#13;
consumer goods consumption.&#13;
7/ It can also be noted that the average size of household decreased&#13;
from 5.1 persons in 1970 to 4.5 persons in 1980. Also, the number&#13;
of persons per room fell from 2.5 to 2.2 between 1970 and 1980.&#13;
The observed decline in average household size may be overstated&#13;
because of a possible sampling bias towards smaller households in&#13;
the administration of the long form census questionnaire, on which&#13;
the advance tabulations are based. Although this possibility is&#13;
minimized by IBGE, the effects of any such bias, if indeed&#13;
existent, are difficult to assess in their impact on the income&#13;
distribution measures reported in this paper. Subsequent to the&#13;
release of the advance tabulations, IBGE has been engaged in&#13;
analysis envisaging a reweighting prior to the release of the&#13;
final census results. The effect of the bias on individual income&#13;
estimates, and as a result the distribution of income by income&#13;

On the basis of the observed increase in literacy, the expansion&#13;
and increased distributional equality of schooling, improved sanitation&#13;
facilities, and increased household possession of consumer goods and&#13;
services, one is tempted to draw some tentative conclusions about changes&#13;
in living standards and welfare during the decade of the 1970's.8/ The&#13;
non-income evidence discussed so far and available from the census&#13;
materials suggests some substantial improvements. At the minimum, it would&#13;
appear that there is little factual support for the contention by some of&#13;
deteriorating living conditions and growing poverty. Further evidence,&#13;
suggesting improvement, is observed when incomes are introduced into the&#13;
analysis. It is to such analysis that we now turn our attention.&#13;
III. INCOME MEASURES OF POVERTY AND INCOME CONCENTRATION&#13;
In presenting income measures of poverty and income&#13;
concentration, our analysis is necessarily based upon individual incomes.&#13;
Family incomes cannot be constructed from the published advance census&#13;
tabulations.9/   Although the family figures are superior for many&#13;
purposes, we think that the information on individuals is also useful, both&#13;
8/  Some ultimate reflections of social welfare conditions are changes&#13;
in infant mortality and life expectancy. Measures of these&#13;
variables can be generated from demographic census materials,&#13;
although this, to our knowledge, has only been done in preliminary&#13;
form from the 1980 Brazilian demographic census information.&#13;
Comparing these preliminary estimates for 1980 made by IBGE and&#13;
reported in the press (Jornal do Brasil, November 14, 1982) with&#13;
earlier estimates, improvement is seen to have continued. Infant&#13;
mortality rates for Brazil as a whole, expressed per 1000 live&#13;
births, fell from 123 in 1960, to 107 in 1970, and to 93 in 1980.&#13;
Life expectancy at birth, again for the country as a whole, is&#13;
estimated to have increased from 53.5 years in 1970 to 58.7 years&#13;
in 1980.&#13;
9/ Analyses of family income distributions for 1970 include Lluch&#13;
(1981) and Fox (1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
for insights regarding the labor market and, since few in the top 40% of&#13;
the individual distribution are likely to be in the bottom 40% of the&#13;
adult-equivalent per capita family distribution in a country characterized&#13;
by great inequality, for conclusions about welfare.&#13;
In constructing inequality estimates we have employed Gini coef-&#13;
ficients, Theil indices, and deciles to summarize income distributions.&#13;
The Gini and Theil indices buttress each other as single-valued measures&#13;
because of their differing sensitivities. The Gini index is especially&#13;
sensitive to income transfers near the mean. The Theil index, even&#13;
relative to its generally greater overall variability, is more sensitive to&#13;
transfers within the lower and higher ranges. In view of the uncertainties&#13;
introduced by our approximation techniques, especially at the extremes of&#13;
the spectrum, we feel more confident about our conclusions when the Gini&#13;
and Theil measures change in the same direction. The Theil index is a&#13;
superior measure for complete data and has useful decomposition properties.&#13;
The Gini coefficient, besides having well-analyzed properties, complements&#13;
the Theil index when data are grouped. The deciles provide more detailed&#13;
information.&#13;
The Gini coefficients are estimated from eight income intervals&#13;
using Gastwirth's method I (1972) to establish bounds. Bounds on the Theil&#13;
indices are established using Theil's method (1967). Single values are&#13;
derived from these bounds with the simple interpolations advocated by&#13;
Cowell and Mehta (1982). The eight income intervals are converted into&#13;
deciles with the polynomial approximation to the Lorenz curve described by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Kakwani (1980, pp. 103-104). Especially for low-income groups, figures for&#13;
the lower two deciles are suggestive only.&#13;
The advance tabulations of the demographic census are constructed&#13;
from a sample of the population. For most groups this sample is quite&#13;
adequate, but in some cases, sectors within small states, for example,&#13;
sampling error could have a noticeable effect on our measures. In such&#13;
cases, we do not have true upper and lower bounds but merely consistent&#13;
estimates of them. Nevertheless, we think this problem is minor for all&#13;
regional and national aggregations.&#13;
To make comparisons in income between 1970 and 1980 adjustments&#13;
for inflation and necessary. Ideally, a cost-of-living index would be the&#13;
most suitable deflator, despite a tendency to overstate inflation, in&#13;
theory at least, because of the failure to adequately account for&#13;
substitution in the market basket in response to relative price changes.&#13;
In practice, however, owing to alleged irregularities in constructing the&#13;
Rio de Janeiro cost-of-living index, particularly in 1973, its use appears&#13;
to understate inflation and thereby to overstate real income growth. Since&#13;
the general internal price index is a weighted average of different&#13;
indices, including the Rio cost-of-living index, its use also reflects the&#13;
apparent tampering that occurred in the mid-1970s. In view of these&#13;
difficulties with the cost-of-living and general price indices, it was&#13;
decided to use information from the national income accounts. Instead of&#13;
simply employing the GDP implicit deflator, as Langoni did in his 1960-70&#13;
comparisons, we elected to construct an implicit deflator for consumption&#13;
expenditures from the published FGV estimates of constant and current price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
comsumption expenditures in GDP over time.10/ This procedure has given us&#13;
the most conservative, i.e, lower bound, estimates of real income&#13;
increases.&#13;
Most of our estimates are based on data for the economically&#13;
active population (EAP) with positive incomes. In 1980, of the total EAP&#13;
of 43,796,763, there were 3,294,659, or 7.5%, who had no cash income and&#13;
146,744, or 0.3%, who refused to report their incomes to the census&#13;
takers. This latter group is small and may be ignored without harm for our&#13;
purposes. More significantly, we have also chosen to exclude those with no&#13;
cash income. This is partly to facilitate comparison with the 1970 decile&#13;
group estimates of Langoni (1973) and partly because including zero-income&#13;
individuals makes the inequality measures derived from data for individual&#13;
recipients less useful as indicators of changes in the distribution of&#13;
family income. This is suggested by the fact that in 1970 the zero-income&#13;
members of EAP came almost as often as not from middle-income families as&#13;
shown by Lluch (1981, p. 24).&#13;
The determination of changes in the degree of income inequality&#13;
between 1970 and 1980 in Brazil is complicated by the existence in 1970 of&#13;
an upper coding limit on income. All incomes of Cr$ 9998 or more per mnth&#13;
were coded as Cr$ 9998, a figure which after adjustment for inflation by&#13;
the implicit consumption deflator corresponds to Cr$285,000 of 1980, or&#13;
10/ Fundacao Getu'lio Vargas, Conjuntura Econo'mica, Vol. 35, No. 12&#13;
(December 1981). For every year in the 1972-76 period, the change in&#13;
the implicit consumption deflator exceeded the Rio cost-of-living&#13;
index increase, with the greatest part of the overall difference being&#13;
attributed to 1973. For that year the implicit consumption deflator&#13;
was computed to rise 22.3% as compared to the 12.6% increase in the&#13;
Rio cost-of-living index.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
approximately US$5,215. It is about 30 times the mean income for 1970.&#13;
This truncation of the upper tail of the income distribution reduces both&#13;
the Gini coefficient and the Theil index. Adjustments to the 1970&#13;
estimates of Langoni (1973) to account for the limitations imposed by the&#13;
1970 coding limit raises the Gini and Theil measures considerably. 11/&#13;
Accordingly, the growth in inequality observed during the 1960s may have&#13;
been understated.&#13;
Including such adjustments for the 1970 coding limit problem,&#13;
Table 4 presents the results of the basic overall 1970 and 1980 comparisons&#13;
for income inequality. In the upper half of this table, comparison of the&#13;
first and third columns gives the impression of a moderate increase in&#13;
inequality during the 1970s. But, as indicated, Langoni's calculations for&#13;
1970 were hampered by the upper coding limit on income. The second column&#13;
shows plausible values for the true inequality measures for that year.&#13;
With the adjustments the picture becomes less clear. We emphasize that we&#13;
are not advancing the figures in the second column as accurate. Our point&#13;
is simply that any change in overall inequality over the decade was not&#13;
large enough to be fully and unequivocally discerned by our measures. The&#13;
lower half of Table 4 provides additional support for this conclusion of no&#13;
significant deterioration of the income distribution of the total EAP, as&#13;
distinct from the non-zero income EAP. With adjustment for the 1970 coding&#13;
limit, the argument of no discernible deterioration becomes still stronger.&#13;
The evidence does appear sufficient to reject the hypothesis of increased&#13;
inequality.&#13;

Source:   Using the formulae derived in the appendix, the Gini coefficient&#13;
and the Theil indices are calculated from those derived with&#13;
zero-income workers excluded. For 1970, the share of the lowest&#13;
40% is estimated as the midpoint of bounds set on the relevant&#13;
point of the Lorenz curve, using data from Langoni (1982, p.21)&#13;
and from Tabulacoes Avancadas do Censo Demografico 1970, Table&#13;
8. The bounds on the Langoni share are (7.32%, 7.52%) and on the&#13;
share adjusted to allow for the upper coding limit (7.07%,&#13;
7.26%). The share of the top decile is estimated with a&#13;
quadratic approximation technique using the same sources of&#13;
data. The bounds on the Langoni share are (50.90%, 51.71%) and&#13;
on the adjusted share (54.32%, 55.13%). Since the Tabulac6es&#13;
Avangadas of the 1980 census provide both means and limits for&#13;
income groups, we use the third-degree polynomial approximation&#13;
suggested by Kakwani (1982, p. 103) to estimate the share of the&#13;
lowest 40% and top decile in 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
The overall stability in distributional inequality can also be&#13;
seen through an examination of the income decile groups. Table 5 presents&#13;
estimates of the proportion of total income going to different decile&#13;
groups for the country's total economically active population for 1970 and&#13;
1980. Little change can be discerned. Table 5 also presents estimates of&#13;
the mean income for each decile group.12/ The average income for all&#13;
groups, as observed, increased by an estimated 49%.13/ Comparing 1970 and&#13;
1980, all decile groups participated in this increase. This feature of the&#13;
1970's contrasts markedly with the experience of the 1960's, for which&#13;
disproportionate gains for the upper income groups were quite evident. One&#13;
should note that, because of coding limits and the rather arbitrary&#13;
assumptions necessary for estimating the tails of the distribution, the&#13;
gains of the first and tenth deciles are not entirely reliable. Yet, it&#13;
appears that the gains from rapid economic growth during the 1970's were&#13;
widely distributed. Substantial real income gains were observed by all&#13;
decile groups. This pattern is also evident when decile groups for&#13;
12/ The average exchange rate in August 1980 was Cr$54.65 per US dollar.&#13;
Using this figure, which of course has a very loose relationship to the&#13;
ratio of the cost-of-living in Brazil and the United States, suggests an&#13;
average annual income of $2,622 per member of the economically active&#13;
population, $639 for the bottom 40%, $12,600 for the top decile, $1,556&#13;
for the Northeast, and $1,462 for agriculture. For the bottom 40% of&#13;
those with positive incomes in agriculture in the Northeast, the average&#13;
annual income is $348, approximately a dollar a day on average for these&#13;
two million workers. In all Brazil about four million workers earned&#13;
cash incomes below a dollar a day.&#13;
13/ As noted above, the observed average increase of 49% represents a lower&#13;
bound estimate. Using alternative indices for deflation yields average&#13;
increase of 100%, 76% and 55% for the Rio de Janeiro cost-of-living&#13;
index, the general price index, and the GDP implicit deflator,&#13;
respectively. The magnitude of the average gains does not affect the&#13;
conclusion that the gains from growth during 1970s did not appreciably&#13;
change the income distribution. In any event, the average real income&#13;
increases were substantial and were experienced by all decile groups.&#13;
It should be noted, however, if the sampling error referred to in&#13;
Footnote 7 resulted in a systematic exclusion of large families in&#13;
outlying rural areas, it is likely that the gains in the bottom decile&#13;
are overstated.&#13;

into deciles with the polynomial approximation described by Kakwani (1980, pp.103-104).&#13;

regions and urban and rural occupations are examined (Appendix Tables A7,&#13;
A8, and A9). Consequently, despite continuing marked income inequality,&#13;
the evidence suggests that the decade of the 1970's witnessed a reduction&#13;
in poverty, seemingly on a considerable scale.&#13;
IV. INTERPRETATIONS OF CHANGES IN INCOME INEQUALITY&#13;
As is often the case, the evident aggregate stability in the&#13;
income distribution covers sectoral turbulence. In Brazil during the 1970s&#13;
two major developments offset each other. First, the difference between&#13;
average incomes among sectors narrowed, thereby reducing inequality.      On&#13;
the other hand, inequality within the agricultural sector soared, raising&#13;
inequality. These two developments, along with changes in regional&#13;
disparities, can be seen in Table 6.&#13;
The first panel of Table 6 suggests that regional disparities&#13;
diminished in the 1970s, with average income per member of the economically&#13;
active population rising more rapidly in the low-income Northeast than in&#13;
the higher-income Southeast. Average income in the Northeast went from 46%&#13;
to 51% of that in the Southeast. However, both rural and urban incomes&#13;
rose less in the Northeast than elsewhere. The Northeast gained only&#13;
because, with its labor force more heavily concentrated in agriculture, it&#13;
benefited more than other regions from the exodus from agriculture and the&#13;
more rapid growth of incomes in the primary sector. This greater rapidity&#13;
of growth was due to a jump in incomes in the top two rural deciles coupled&#13;
with above average rates of increase in the other eight. The proportion of&#13;
the EAP in the Northeast in the bottom 40% of the income distribution of&#13;
Brazil stayed at 67% from 1970 to 1980.&#13;

One way to examine sectoral changes is to partition the Theil&#13;
index across sectors. We can write:&#13;
3                3&#13;
(1)           T2-T1 = (I2-Il)+   Yij(Ti2-Tii)+   Ti2(Yi2-Yi1)&#13;
i=1              i=1&#13;
where Ti is the Theil index for year j, Ij is the among sectors inequality&#13;
index for year j, Yij is the share of sector i in total income in year j,&#13;
and Tij is the within-sector Theil index for sector i in year j. The first&#13;
term on the right-hand side of Equation (1) may be called the among-sectors&#13;
effect, the second term the within-sectors effect, and the third term the&#13;
sectoral shift effect.&#13;
Applying Equation (1) to the EAP in 1970 and 1980 in the primary,&#13;
secondary, and tertiary sectors yields:&#13;
Effect&#13;
Among sectors                          -.0563&#13;
Within sectors                          .1090&#13;
Primary                   .0665&#13;
Secondary                 .0074&#13;
Tertiary                  .0351&#13;
Sectoral Shift                         -.0097&#13;
Total                                   .0430&#13;
Interpreted as written, the results above show a decrease in the&#13;
among sectors effect attributable to the rise in relative incomes in&#13;
agriculture, more than offset by an increase in inequality within&#13;
agriculture. A small but heavily weighted increase in the Theil index in&#13;
the tertiary sector adds to the rise in the overall index. While these&#13;
results make no allowance for the 1970 upper coding limit, similar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
exercises making adjustments revealed no major differences. Two&#13;
conclusions seem reasonably secure. First, inequality among sectors fell,&#13;
and, second, inequality within agriculture rose.&#13;
The cause of the reduction of inequality among sectors is readily&#13;
identified: income per economically active person in agriculture climbed&#13;
from 37% of the average for the secondary and tertiary sectors in 1970 to&#13;
50% in 1980, according to the census data. Other sources confirm this&#13;
remarkable increase. For example, while the proportion of the EAP engaged&#13;
in agriculture declined from 40% to 27%, the national income and product&#13;
accounts show the agricultural share in the GDP roughly constant at 10%.&#13;
This suggests that a major source of income growth in Brazil has been the&#13;
transfer of labor out of the low productivity agricultural sector into&#13;
higher productivity sectors. It is also true that relative price movements&#13;
between agriculture and industry during the 1970s were partly responsible&#13;
for narrowing the gap between rural and urban mean incomes. The internal&#13;
terms of trade, defined as wholesale agricultural prices relative to&#13;
wholesale industrial prices, moved in favor of agriculture, especially in&#13;
1979-80. An index number expressing the ratio of the two price indices&#13;
increased from 100.0 in 1970 to 154.6 in 1980.&#13;
For the agricultural sector itself a marked increase in income&#13;
inequality can be discerned. All measures tell the same story. The Gini&#13;
coefficient rose from 0.44 to 0.54, the Theil index soared from 0.43 to&#13;
0.80 (Appendix Table A3), the income share of the bottom 40% fell from&#13;
15.6% to 12.4%, and the share of the top decile went from 36% to 48%&#13;
(Appendix Table A8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
As with the investigation of inequality among sectors,&#13;
decomposition of the Theil index is a useful tool for preliminary analysis&#13;
of the sources of this greater income disparity in the primary sector. The&#13;
Theil index for 1970, TI, may be written for agriculture as&#13;
(2)                        T1 = R1 +IyilTil&#13;
i&#13;
where R1 is a regional inequality term, the yil1s are regional income&#13;
shares, and the Til's are regional Theil indices. Using analogous&#13;
notation,&#13;
(3)                       T2 = R2 +EYi2Ti2&#13;
i&#13;
is the same equation for 1980. In both Equations (2) and (3) i ranges from&#13;
1 to 10, corresponding to the ten regions of the 1970 census.&#13;
To allocate the change in the index we can write:&#13;
(4)      T2 - T1 = (R2 - R1) + Tyil(Ti2 - Til) + (Yi2 - yil)Ti2-&#13;
The first expression on the right-hand side of Equation (4) is an effect&#13;
reflecting changed disparities among regions, the second represents changes&#13;
in inequality within regions, and the third reflects shifts in income&#13;
shares to regions with greater or lesser degrees of inequality.&#13;
Applying Equation (4) to data from Appendix Table A3, we find&#13;
that 90% of the increase in the Theil index for agriculture is due to more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
inequality within regions. Only 4% is attributable to higher income shares&#13;
in regions with greater inequality and only 6% to greater disparity among the&#13;
ten 1970 census regions. While the fact that of the ten regions three -- the&#13;
Lower Northeast (chiefly Bahia), the Center (chiefly Minas Gerais), and&#13;
Paranda -- with 37% of agricultural income account for 56% of the increase in&#13;
inequality, may be worth exploring, clearly the phenomenon is general. For&#13;
the agricultural sector, every measure shows greater inequality for every&#13;
region. In each of the ten census regions, as may be seen from Appendix&#13;
Table A3, the Gini coefficient rose, the Theil index rose, the income share&#13;
of the bottom 40% fell, and the share of the top decile rose. In the urban&#13;
sectors, in contrast, the various regions had differing experiences.&#13;
Inequality remained roughly constant in the Northeast, declined in Sao Paulo,&#13;
and rose elsewhere.&#13;
It is useful here to briefly discuss three possible explanations&#13;
for the observed increase in inequality within agriculture. First, in&#13;
addition to lifting agricultural incomes in Brazil generally, the commodities&#13;
boom of 1979-1980 also most likely generated inequality through, for example,&#13;
the surging production of particular export crops, such as cocoa in Bahia and&#13;
soybeans elsewhere. Soybeans, cultivated on relatively large farms, probably&#13;
exercised an especially severe impact on the distribution of earnings where&#13;
this crop replaced more labor-intensive coffee, as happened in Parana. But&#13;
these location-specific explanations do not explain why inequality within&#13;
agriculture rose within every region of Brazil. More geographically diffused&#13;
sources of change must be sought.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
A second, and perhaps most important, explanation for increased&#13;
income inequality within agriculture lies in the growth of the credit&#13;
subsidies for agriculture during the decade. With fixed nominal interest&#13;
rates, high inflation, and substantial credit allocation for agriculture the&#13;
subsidies, both expressed as rates and in volume terms, became substantial.&#13;
One study has estimated that these credit subsidies, expressed as a&#13;
proportion, amounted to 21% of the total value of agricultural output in&#13;
1980.14/ While also presenting substantial macroeconomic difficulties,&#13;
along with other, microeconomic distortionary effects, it seems incontestable&#13;
that these subsidies, and their increase, have had the effect of increasing&#13;
inequality within agriculture.    First, only landowners, as contrasted to&#13;
landless workers, qualify. Second, the amount of credit, and consequent&#13;
credit subsidy bonanza, appears to be a positive function of the size of land&#13;
holdings.   Despite the considerable increases in agricultural credit ceilings&#13;
through the Banco do Brasil in the late 1970s, credit rationing has still&#13;
proven necessary in the face of the demand for the subsidies.      One study&#13;
(Ferreira, 1981) estimatea that only 4% of the total amount of agricultural&#13;
credit in the Northeast in 1975 went to farms of less than 10 hectares.&#13;
A third possible explanation for the observed increase of income&#13;
inequality within agriculture can be found in the theory of human capital.&#13;
In every region of Brazil average years of schooling rose for the EAP in&#13;
agriculture during the 1970's. For all Brazil the composition of the EAP&#13;
in agriculture by years of schooling was:&#13;
14/  Tyler (1981).   A comparable study by Gerva'sio Resende and Milton da Mata&#13;
(1981), employing a somewhat different procedure, presents an even&#13;
higher estimate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Total                   100%            100%&#13;
Human capital theory predicts that inequality rises with average&#13;
educational attainment. For Brazil in 1970, Langoni (1973, pp. 253-255)&#13;
confirms this through ginasio by finding the Gini coefficient to be 0.260&#13;
for illiterates, 0.458 for those completing primario, and 0.502 for those&#13;
completing ginasio. Human capital theory also predicts that inequality&#13;
rises with greater inequality of educational attainment.&#13;
We find the data for the rural sector of Brazil in accordance&#13;
with both of these predictions, as shown by Equation (5), in which GINI is&#13;
the Gini index of income equality for the rural sectors of each of the 23&#13;
census "states" in 1980, LAVED is the natural logarithm of the average years&#13;
of schooling of the EAP, and GED is a Gini index of inequality of years of&#13;
schooling of the EAP.&#13;
(5)           GINI =  -.0370 +   .228  LAVED + .5887 GED&#13;
(.060)         (.250)&#13;
R2 = 0.630&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
The standard errors indicate both coefficients to be significant, and the&#13;
R2 shows that these two variables explain five-eighths of the variance in&#13;
rural inequality across the states of Brazil.     Appendix Table A5 displays&#13;
more regressions of this type.&#13;
These regressions do not prove causation. It may be that&#13;
inequality of years of schooling results from income inequality rather than&#13;
vice-versa, just as inequality in ownership of consumer durables results&#13;
from, but probably does not cause, income inequality. Studies which&#13;
suggest the returns to education in Brazil are quite high, particularly for&#13;
the early years, lead us to think that educational inequality in fact does&#13;
cause income inequality, especially if years of schooling is considered to&#13;
include better health and other qualities usually associated with&#13;
educational attainment. We also note that in the primary sector of Brazil&#13;
in the 1970's income inequality and educational inequality moved in&#13;
contrary directions, a further indication that educational inequality plays&#13;
an independent role.&#13;
- If the human capital interpretation of Equation (5) is accepted,&#13;
its coeffcients explain around two-fifths of the observed increase in&#13;
income inequality in the rural sector as measured by the Gini coefficient.&#13;
Appendix Table A6 shows that a 34% increase in average years of schooling&#13;
between 1970 and 1980 accompanied a decrease of GED from 0.707 to 0.660.&#13;
The first change raises inequality but the second lowers it, leaving&#13;
three-fifths of the increase to be explained. Perhaps the age structure of&#13;
the EAP changed in a relevant way over the decade. We cannot tell from the&#13;
advance tabulations. Perhaps the more detailed income questions in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
1980 census elicited fuller responses from the upper deciles of the primary&#13;
sector more than from others. Again, we cannot determine whether this is&#13;
so from the material at hand. At present the greater inequality within&#13;
agriculture remains partly a mystery.&#13;
The results of our analysis of the 1980 demographic census&#13;
materials can also be used to offer some interpretations regarding the&#13;
labor market. The evolution of the labor market between 1970 and 1980 is&#13;
broadly consistent with the hypothesis that, in terms of. a dualistic model,&#13;
Brazil reached a turning point during the early 1970's.15/ Over the&#13;
decade real wages roughly doubled, and this gain was shared by the lower&#13;
income groups. Income inequality may have improved slightly or may have&#13;
worsened slightly; in either case the change was small. A large rightward&#13;
shift in the demand for labor in the urban sectors pulled migrants from&#13;
rural areas, so that the share of agriculture in the labor force plunged&#13;
from 40% to 28%. This process pulled up rural wages from 37% to 50% of&#13;
urban levels. Higher urban wages also drew more women into the labor&#13;
force. For women 10 and over the participation rate rose from 19% to 27%.&#13;
Apparently women's elasticity of supply was greater at the lower skill&#13;
levels, with the result that the ratio of female to male incomes, after&#13;
rising a bit in the 1960's, lost ground in the 1970's, going from 61% to&#13;
56% for the economically active population.&#13;
The Brazilian labor market also changed in ways generally&#13;
consistent with human capital theory. Associated with higher incomes was a&#13;
15/ Morley (1982) advanced this hypothesis in a recent study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
rise of 40% in the average years of schooling of the labor force.&#13;
Illiteracy declined from 33% to 26% of the population 15 and over. At the&#13;
same time, in accordance with the human capital interpretation, higher&#13;
educational levels pushed income inequality up, and improved distribution of&#13;
schooling pulled it back down. The Gini coefficient for inequality of years&#13;
of schooling dropped from 0.598 to 0.499 over the decade (Appendix Table A6).&#13;
But much of the picture of the development of the labor market in&#13;
the 1970's remains unclear. One of the gaps is the distributional impact&#13;
of the higher female participation rate. In a strictly accounting sense&#13;
rising female participation had little effect on the distribution of&#13;
individual incomes. In an experiment in which we construct a hypothetical&#13;
1980 distribution of income by keeping the male and female patterns as they&#13;
were in 1980 but reducing the female participation rate to its 1970 level,&#13;
we find changes in the inequality measures for individuals only in the&#13;
third places after the decimals.&#13;
Nonetheless, the fact that a fourth of the increase in the&#13;
Brazilian labor force in the 1970's was due to the rising female labor&#13;
force participation rate probably does affect the distribution of income&#13;
noticeably through processes our methods fail to capture. First, families&#13;
have more income earners than otherwise. Is the effect concentrated on&#13;
part of the range of family incomes or spread evenly across it? Second,&#13;
women compete with men for jobs, especially at the lower end of the&#13;
spectrum of wages. Does this extra competition drive those wages down?&#13;
Investigation of these matters requires individual rather than categorical&#13;
data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Another question concerns the limited integration of the national&#13;
labor market in Brazil. Wages in the Northeast average less than half of&#13;
those in the Southeast and have for decades. Why is this differential not&#13;
eliminated by inter-regional factor flows? Part of the explanation is that&#13;
labor in the Northeast is less qualified. The average number of years of&#13;
schooling in the Northeast for the EAP is only half that in the Southeast.&#13;
Moreover, some migration occurs. Had there been no inter-regional&#13;
migration at all, the population of the Northeast would have been larger&#13;
by a sixth in 1980. The effect of migration on the labor force may have&#13;
been greater still. And there may be substantial regional differences in&#13;
the cost of living, although they would be balanced by a greater&#13;
availability of public services in higher-cost areas. All in all, the&#13;
persistence of such enormous regional disparities remains a puzzle.&#13;
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS&#13;
The 1980 demographic census presents a wealth of information.&#13;
The data made available so far, in the form of advance tabulations, have&#13;
permitted us to undertake some exploratory analysis of poverty and income&#13;
inequality for 1980. The data can then be used for some comparisons&#13;
between 1970 and 1980. The results show that there has been substantial&#13;
progress in improving living standards during the 1970's. The non-income&#13;
measures of poverty attest to considerable progress, despite continued and&#13;
pressing problems of poverty. Average real incomes have also increased&#13;
substantially, even among the poorest 40% of the economically active&#13;
population. Overall income inequality did not undergo appreciable change&#13;
between 1970 and 1980. The relative stability of a high level of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
inequality was due to two offsetting changes. On the one hand, there was&#13;
observed a large rise in rural incomes relative to urban incomes. On the&#13;
other hand, however, there was an increase in the inequality of incomes&#13;
within agriculture. The overall picture has been one of some reduction in&#13;
regional income disparities, and, in general, the available evidence&#13;
points to a reduction in absolute poverty during the 1970s. This is not to&#13;
suggest, however, that income inequality and poverty do not, or should not,&#13;
remain as principal problem areas for concern for Brazilian policy-makers.&#13;
One must also ponder whether, in view of the employment opportunities&#13;
generated during the high growth 1970s, slower economic growth, and&#13;
recession as observed in 1981-83, will not exacerbate underlying&#13;
socio-economic problems.&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
Zero-Income Workers&#13;
In this appendix we show that the Gini and Theil indices calculated&#13;
excluding zero-income workers easily can be adjusted to include these&#13;
people. We turn first to the Gini coefficient and then to the Theil index.&#13;
The adjustment of the Gini can be developed intuitively in terms of the&#13;
derivation of this coefficient from a Lorenz curve for the population&#13;
excluding zero-income individuals which relates q, the accumulated percentage&#13;
of income, to p the population percentile, written as the inverse function of&#13;
the usual form:&#13;
(Al)                        p = f(q).&#13;
The Gini coefficient, G, for this population is&#13;
(A2)          G - 2f(p-l)dq =    pjdq - I&#13;
Let N be the number of people with positive incomes and No the number with&#13;
zero incomes. Let z equal NO/N, the ratio of zero-income EAP to&#13;
positive-income EAP. The inclusion of the zero-income groups shifts the&#13;
Lorenz curve rightward so that a percentile pf on the new curve corresponding&#13;
to the same q is given by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
(A3)                   f   p+z&#13;
Hence the Gini coefficient, Gf, for the full group is&#13;
(A4)               Gf = 4jpfdq - I&#13;
After substitution from (A3) and some manipulation this may be written&#13;
Gf= 1      (2 dg - 1) + -+-&#13;
1+Iz  jf            1+z&#13;
0&#13;
(A5)             Gf = G + -   (1 - G).&#13;
1+z&#13;
Thus Gini coefficient for the full population is simply the Gini for the&#13;
positive-income group plus the ratio of the zero-income individuals to the&#13;
full population multiplied by the complement of the original Gini.&#13;
The derivation of the adjustment to the Theil index is direct.&#13;
The Theil index, T, for positive-income recipients may be written&#13;
(A6)                 T =IyilnyiN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
where yi is the income share of the ith person and "+" indicates summation&#13;
over positive-income individuals. Defining z as before, the Theil index,&#13;
Tf, for the full population is&#13;
(A7)     T= E yilnyiN(l+z) + E yilnyiN(1+z)&#13;
0                 +&#13;
where "o" indicates summation over those with zero incomes and each person&#13;
is now one out of N(1+z) instead of N individuals. The first term on the&#13;
right-hand side of (A7) goes to zero as the yi go to zero. Noting this and&#13;
that           (A8)                      Yi = 1&#13;
we can write (A7), substituting from (A6), as&#13;
(A9)                Tf =  T + ln(1+z)&#13;
Hence inclusion of a zero-income group augments both the Gini coefficient&#13;
and the Theil 'index in simple ways.&#13;
In summary, we have excluded zero-income members of the EAP from&#13;
our calculations to aid comparison with Langoni's figures for 1970 and&#13;
because their inclusion weakens the association between individual and&#13;
family income deciles. Including zero-income recipients' raises the&#13;
agricultural inequality measures markedly but does not change the general&#13;
picture: during the 1970s, overall inequality remained roughly constant&#13;
while rising sharply within agriculture.&#13;

The 1970 Upper Coding Limit&#13;
As noted in the text, the determination of changes in the degree&#13;
of inequality between 1970 and 1980 in Brazil is complicated by the&#13;
existence in 1970 of an upper coding limit on income. All incomes of 9998&#13;
or more cruzeiros per month were coded as 9998, a figure which after&#13;
adjustment for inflation by the Rio cost-of-living index corresponds to&#13;
285,000 cruzeiros of 1980, or approximately US$5,215.      It is about 30&#13;
times the mean income for 1970. This truncation of the upper tail of the&#13;
income distribution reduces both the Gini coefficient and the Theil index.&#13;
The effect of this truncation on the Gini coefficient may be&#13;
viewed through its impact on the Lorenz curve.    Let      V.Y1  be the&#13;
1=1&#13;
,.~ *&#13;
amount of true income and     &#142;Yi    be the amount of coded income, with&#13;
G calculated from the distribution f(Y) and G* calculated from the&#13;
distribution f*(Y*), where f*(Y*) is identical to f(Y) up to the upper&#13;
coding limit. The respective Lorenz curves are L(q,p) and L*(q*,p), where&#13;
p is the percentile of recipients while q and q* are the accumulated&#13;
percentages of income. We define w to be the ratio of coded to actual&#13;
total income:&#13;
N  *  N&#13;
(A10)                     w=     Yi/ :   i&#13;
If wdia      psh       oli        pctei=l  i=l&#13;
If we designate p as the population percentile at the upper&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
coding limit, then using an argument similar to that developed in the&#13;
previous section -- with integration over p instead of q, and using limits&#13;
-- it may be shown that&#13;
(All)                  m 1 G = G* + (1-w)(1-G*).&#13;
Equation (All) serves as a good approximation for our purposes since the&#13;
area between the Lorenz curve and the 45-degree line to the right 2f p is&#13;
quite small.&#13;
A crude estimate of w, the ratio of coded to actual income, may&#13;
be obtained from data presented by Lluch (1981). In a random selection of&#13;
16,310 families with reported incomes from the 1970 Public Use Sample, he&#13;
found 19 coded at the upper limit, or 0.12%. Partly for simplicity let us&#13;
suppose that for individuals the ratio would be slightly lower, say one per&#13;
thousand. The average income for individuals was 282 cruzeiros per mnnth.&#13;
As an approximation, take the upper coding limit to be 10,000 instead of&#13;
9,998. A person coded at the upper limit would have, out of a thousand&#13;
typical individuals, a reported income equal to 3.55% of the total reported&#13;
income of 282,000. Suppose this person's actual income were 20,000&#13;
(corresponding to a Pareto distribution with alpha equal to two). Then w&#13;
would equal 282,000/292,000 or .966, and Langoni's 1970 Gini of .565 would&#13;
be raised to .580, within the range of error of our estimate for 1980 of&#13;
.590.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
It is convenient to use this same numerical illustration to&#13;
discuss the effect of the upper coding limit on the Theil index. The Theil&#13;
index derived from coded incomes, T*, can be decomposed as&#13;
(A12) T* = (272/282)ln[(272/282)/.999] + (10/282)ln[(10/282)/.001]&#13;
+ (272/282)TL + (10/282)TH&#13;
*      *&#13;
where TL and TH are the within-group Theil indices for those below the&#13;
coding limit and those at or above it, respectively, based on coded&#13;
incomes. Since all incomes in the upper group are coded at the same value,&#13;
10,000, TH is zero.   Hence, using Langoni's value of .6629 for T , TL&#13;
is found to be .5912.&#13;
Now consider T, the Theil index based on actual incomes. If the&#13;
average income of those in the upper group is 20,000, we have&#13;
(A13) T = (272/292)ln[(272/292)/.999] + (20/292)ln[(20/292)/.001]&#13;
+ (272/292)(.5912) + (20/292)TH,&#13;
where TH is the within-group Theil index for those at or above the coding&#13;
limit. The within-group index is unaffected by removal of the coding&#13;
limit. If the upper distribution is Pareto with alpha equal to two, then,&#13;
using a formula derived by Theil (1967, p. 98), TH equals .3068 and T&#13;
equals .796, which is higher than our estimate for 1980 of .704.&#13;

The 1970 data are from Langoni (1973, pp. 300-309). Langoni's inequality measures are calculated from&#13;
ILIuIvIouaJ aaEa.  ine itou figures are calculated from the Tabulacoes Avangadas of the 1980 demographic&#13;
census of Brazil. For estimating inequality measures we used the number of people in each income&#13;
interval from Table 5.2 and estimated the mean income for each income interval be weighting the interval&#13;
means for urban males and females in Table 5.3 by male and female interval numbers in Table 5.2 state by&#13;
state. Bounds on the Gini coefficients were calculated using Method I by Gastwirth (1972) and those on the&#13;
Theil index with the technique described by Theil (1967). Point estimates of the Gini and Theil&#13;
measures were derived from these bounds using the "one-third, two-thirds" rule adovcated by Cowell and&#13;
Mehta (1982). The upper bound on coding the income data used by Langoni was approximately 35 times the&#13;
mean income, affecting perhaps 1% of the population. We do not know if there was an upper bound on the&#13;
1980 data. If so it was at 70 or more times the mean income.&#13;
For both 1970 and 1980 "urban" occupations are all but agriculture. For this group the mean income for&#13;
Brazil was 378 cruzeiros per month in 1970 and 13,914 cruzeiros per month in 1980. Adjusted by the Rio&#13;
cost-of-living index to August 1980 cruzeiros, the 1970 mean income in 8,023. The Gini coefficient for&#13;
the EAP for urban populations for all Brazil in 1970 is calculated through the application of the&#13;
Gastwirth method to data aggregated with a quadratic approximation technique. For comparison, the Theil&#13;
index derived with these methods is .629, close to the value of .622 obtained with the decomposition&#13;
formula for the Theil index.&#13;

Notes:  The dependent variable GINI is the Gini Index of income inequality for each group. The dependent variable TOP40&#13;
is the income share of the highest 40% of individual earners and LOW40 is the lowest 40%. The regressors are LAVED,&#13;
the natural logarithm of average years of schooling, and GED, a Gini index of inequality of years of schooling.   These&#13;
measures are calculated from Tabulacoes Avancadas do Censo Demografico, 1980, Table 5.2.&#13;
Under the heading "Occupations" the word "pooled" refers- to-placing both urban and rural occupations in one&#13;
regression as separate observations. Thus, in Regression 4, this amounts to having 23 rural plus 23 urban "regions.&#13;
Standard errors are in parentheses. All variables are significantly different from zero at the 5% level.&#13;

            Perspectives on poverty and income
            inequality in Brazil : an analysis of the changes during the 1970s
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In the past 20 years the Brazilian
            economy has experienced substantial growth. However, the
            nature of this growth and the growth process itself have
            been controversial, with many critics contending that
            poverty and human misery have increased. Others extol the
            virtures of this Brazilian model of growth, pointing to the
            human benefits accompanying the growth process. An analysis
            of data from the 1980 demographic census attempts to shed
            light on this debate. A descriptive examination of various
            measures of poverty is undertaken with comparisons made
            between 1970 and 1980. Computations are also made of Gini
            coefficients, Theil indices, and income deciles. This
            analysis produces some rather far reaching results and
            conclusions. Despite persistant poverty, during the 1970s
            substantial progress in reducing poverty and improving
            living standards occurred. There is some evidence of overall
            increased income concentration, growing inequality could not
            be fully discerned by our measures. In addition, reductions
            in income inequality among regions and among sectors were
            observed. The agricultural sector in particular was
            characterized by rapidly growing average incomes, despite
            growing income inequality within it.
