INDIA&#13;
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT&#13;
Credit/Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:           India, Acting by its President&#13;
Executing Agency:   Department of Irrigation and Command Area Development (ICADD),&#13;
Government of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP)&#13;
Beneficiary:        The State of Andhra Pradesh (AP)&#13;
Amount:             IDA Credit SDR108.10 million (US$150 million equivalent),&#13;
IBRD Loan US$175 million.&#13;
Poverty:            Not a poverty targeted intervention but the project would raise the&#13;
present income of beneficiaries to above the poverty threshold&#13;
Terms:              IDA to GOI - Standard with 35 years maturity.&#13;
IBRD to GOI - LIBOR-based variable lending rate and repayable&#13;
over 20 years, including a five year grace period.&#13;
Commitment Fee:   0.5% on any undisbursed IDA credit balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing less any waiver.&#13;
0.75% on any undisbursed IBRD loan balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing less any waiver.&#13;
On-Lending Terms:  From  GOI to GOAP under standard arrangements for developmental&#13;
assistance to the states of India. GOI would assume the foreign exchange&#13;
and interest rate risks.&#13;
Project Description:  The project would be an investment credit and loan with the primary&#13;
objective of assisting GOAP to improve the productivity and income of farm&#13;
families in two sub-project areas by completing irrigation works and a social&#13;
improvement program begun under the Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation&#13;
(AP II) Project (Credit 1665-lN/Loan 2662-IN), pilot statewide reforms to&#13;
improve public irrigation scheme performance,. The project's components&#13;
are: (a) Irrigation Works (80.0% of total base costs) to complete the&#13;
irrigation network and feeder roads of the 65,000 ha SRBC irrigation&#13;
project, and rehabilitate 253,000 ha of the SRSP scheme's irrigation system;&#13;
(b) Agricultural Support Services (2.5% of total base costs) to foster&#13;
agricultural diversification and productivity through irrigation agronomy&#13;
research and improved command area extension services, and to improve&#13;
irrigation services by participatory irrigation management through the&#13;
project-wide establishment of Water User Associations (WUAs); (c)&#13;
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Program (5.0% of total base costs) to&#13;
mitigate adverse social impacts of land acquisition for irrigation works&#13;
resulting primarily from AP II works; (d) Environmental Management Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
(7.5% of total base costs) to implement a GOI mandated regional program of&#13;
environmental safeguards and conservation in sub-project districts; (e) Dram&#13;
Safety Assurance Works (5.0% of total base costs) to ensure the safety and&#13;
structural sustainability of the three dams serving the sub-project areas; and&#13;
(f) Project Monitoring and Evaluation (0.5% of total base costs).&#13;
Project Benefits:    The project would reduce production variability in the sub-project areas and&#13;
enable an increase in their production of high value cash crops estimated at&#13;
about US$140 million per annum (in 1995 constant prices). Irrigated&#13;
production would generate over 105,000 farm jobs and generate employment&#13;
in the transport, marketing and processing of farm produce. The incremental&#13;
farm income generated at full development is estimated to raise the income&#13;
of small farmers owning less than 2 ha (who comprise about 70-80% of&#13;
farming families) above the current Andhra Pradesh "Poverty Line"&#13;
threshold. The environmental investments would also generate salable&#13;
timber while the feeder road program would generate economic benefits due&#13;
to improved village access and time savings. The piloting of irrigation&#13;
management reforms and beneficiary participation modalities is expected to&#13;
result in replicable innovations throughout the public irrigation sector and&#13;
contribute to improving its efficiency and performance. The dam safety&#13;
component involving two major multi-purpose dams would not only ensure&#13;
sub-project irrigation sustainability but also irrigation and hydroelectric&#13;
production in the Krishna and Godavari river basins within Andhra Pradesh.&#13;
Project Risks:       Government commitment to the project and its irrigation reform objectives is&#13;
strong and already well-demonstrated. GOAP has ensured O&amp;M cost&#13;
recovery by an unprecedented increase in statewide irrigation water charges&#13;
and is proceeding with a statewide program of participatory irrigation&#13;
management by promoting the establishment of WUAs on all major&#13;
irrigation schemes. There are, however, several ubiquitous risks which have&#13;
been addressed through the project design. Firstly, implementation agency&#13;
motivation risks arising out of a preference for construction work and lack of&#13;
interest in operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) have been addressed by&#13;
organizational separation of construction contract management from O&amp;M&#13;
responsibilities, and spreading responsibility for the agricultural support,&#13;
social and environmental components. Secondly, works implementation&#13;
capacity and delay risks are mitigated by safeguards in project design which&#13;
include a project Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget process, strict&#13;
procurement processing requirements, improved contract management&#13;
procedures and strengthened quality assurance arrangements and training.&#13;
Thirdly, beneficiary response and water availability risks are difficult to&#13;
eliminate by controlled mitigation measures.  Public information and&#13;
consultation has been extensive and it is assumed that social and political&#13;
pressures may be brought to bear on recalcitrant irrigators by farmers who&#13;
are to receive reliable water supplies for the first time.  Financial&#13;
sustainability risks are to be monitored by a standing GOAP Water Charges&#13;
Review Committee.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT&#13;
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
A. The National Context&#13;
Agricultural Development and Poverty&#13;
1.01   Agriculture and its allied activities is still a key sector in India's economy, contributing&#13;
about 32% of the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 69% of employment in 1991. Due to&#13;
population growth, the average size of operational agricultural holdings has dropped from 2.7&#13;
hectares (ha) in 1960/61 to 1.7 ha in 1985/86. Thus increasing land productivity is the main&#13;
challenge to overcoming population growth and maintaining rural income. Bank research indicates&#13;
that rural economic growth in India has a salutary effect on poverty alleviation as the bulk of the&#13;
consumption gains to poor people since about 1970 are attributed to the direct and indirect impacts&#13;
of agricultural growth. Higher yields helped reduce absolute poverty through induced wage effects,&#13;
employment and own-farm productivity.&#13;
Irrigation Development and Management&#13;
1.02   The net irrigated area has grown to about 45.1 million (M) ha in 1989/90, and represents&#13;
about 32.4% of the net sown area of India. Only about 36% of the net area (15.9 M ha) is irrigated&#13;
by public canal systems, while private tubewells, tanks and shallow wells account for the remainder.&#13;
At least three-fourths of India's agricultural growth since 1947 stems from the synergy of fertilizers,&#13;
improved crop varieties and irrigation. While irrigated cereal yields are over twice those of rainfed&#13;
cereals. their average yield is about one third below the all Asia cereal average.&#13;
1.03   Public canal system performance has been below its potential, and significant problems need&#13;
to be addressed to maintain its past contribution: completion of state irrigation projects is&#13;
increasingly delayed; the gap between the planned cropping intensity and area actually irrigated has&#13;
widened; and the economic returns to project investment have been disappointing. The public&#13;
irrigation sub-sector has weaknesses in most areas of implementation and management: resource&#13;
planning is weak, water distribution is unreliable and often inequitable, maintenance is insufficient to&#13;
sustain existing infrastructure, institutions require strengthening, and in most states, construction&#13;
quality and cost recovery are inadequate. Until the early 1950s, revenues from water charges&#13;
exceeded government expenditures for operations and management (O&amp;M) plus interest imputed on&#13;
investment. By 1989, current expenditures on O&amp;M for public canal schemes exceeded revenues&#13;
from water charges by an amount equivalent to 2.1% of the current agricultural contribution to GDP.&#13;
Development and Irrigation Lending Strategy&#13;
1.04   Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The Bank's country assistance strategy for India--&#13;
reviewed by the Board on June 20, 1995 and September 5, 1996 respectively--supports GOI efforts&#13;
to provide an enabling environment for efficient private sector-led growth while strengthening the&#13;
effectiveness of government interventions in areas where it complements the private sector--poverty&#13;
alleviation, environment, human resource and infrastructure development.  Reducing poverty,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
developing the private sector, improving environmental protection and natural resource conservation,&#13;
strengthening institutions, increasing the role of beneficiaries and Non-Governmental Organizations&#13;
(NGOs) in project design and implementation are all important elements of the CAS. Since&#13;
agricultural growth bolsters the rural poor (para. 1.02), national and state agricultural policy reform&#13;
are important instruments of the CAS. State fiscal reform is a focus of the CAS: hence Bank-&#13;
supported state investment projects should be consistent with state fiscal and financial capabilities.&#13;
1.05   India Irrigation Lending Strategy. In line with India's 1987 National Water Policy, the&#13;
Bank's irrigation sector strategy (India Irrigation Sector Review, Report No. 9518-IN, June 27, 1991)&#13;
identified sector reforms in four priority action areas. These areas are: (a) strengthening of river basin&#13;
planning and environmental monitoring capabilities; (b) increase of O&amp;M works expenditure and water&#13;
charges, and re-prioritization of capital expenditure to favor scheme rehabilitation and completion of&#13;
ongoing works over new projects; (c) improvement of canal management and water distribution&#13;
performance; and (d) adoption of management and organizational reforms to strengthen state Irrigation&#13;
Department management accountability for irrigation services, and fostering of beneficiary&#13;
participation in scheme management.&#13;
B. The Andhra Pradesh Context&#13;
Economic Growth and State Finances&#13;
1.06   The economy of AP is still predominantly agrarian and agriculture employs about 67% of&#13;
the work force. Given its poor economic growth performance, AP has failed to expand its revenue&#13;
base needed to finance its subsidy and welfare programs and has been under fiscal stress since the&#13;
mid 1980s. This was created by (a) declining own state revenue as a share of Gross State Domestic&#13;
Product (GSDP); and (b) rapid change of state expenditure composition with substantial increase in&#13;
the share of subsidies, welfare programs, and salaries, together with a corresponding fall in the share&#13;
of non-wage O&amp;M, and expenditure on physical and social infrastructure. As a result, the principal&#13;
fiscal and debt indicators have deteriorated along with growth performance. The fiscal deficit has&#13;
grown to 3.4% of GSDP by FY95/96 with total revenue and expenditure constituting 14% and 18%&#13;
of GSDP respectively. In recent years, about 22% of the State's total expenditures were financed&#13;
through borrowings and the capital expenditure share of total expenditure has been only about 15%.&#13;
1.07   An increasing reliance on central loans to finance State Plan expenditures has led to a high&#13;
level of debt relative to the state revenues. Interest payment have reached 28% of AP's own revenue&#13;
(2.3% of GSDP), while the total state debt amounts to 24% of GSDP. Consequently, the state&#13;
government has been increasingly forced to divert funds away from productive uses and resort to&#13;
borrowing to meet its commitment to expensive welfare schemes. The state's fiscal stress has been&#13;
aggravated in the past two years by introduction of a subsidized rice distribution scheme for the poor,&#13;
and loss of revenue due to prohibition of alcoholic drinks in the state. These programs together have&#13;
put an additional burden of about 4.2% of GSDP on the state's budget, and has precipitated an acute&#13;
fiscal crisis and liquidity difficulties.&#13;
Rural Demography and Poverty&#13;
1.08   Andhra Pradesh (AP) is India's fifth largest State (275,100 km 2) and fourth most populous&#13;
(66.51 million in 1991). Over 73% of the population resides in rural areas but rural to urban&#13;
migration has led to a high urban growth rate. A continuous increase in the number of agricultural&#13;
holdings is occurring with the average size of agricultural holdings dropping from 2.51 ha in 1970 to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
about 1.55 ha in 1991. Marginal and small farms represent about 77% of all holdings, but only about&#13;
36% of the farm area. Whereas AP was the fourth highest state in percentage of population "below&#13;
the poverty line" (BPL) around 1960, it declined to about the nation's fourth lowest around 1990.&#13;
Poverty alleviation has improved more slowly in the 1980s despite the resources allocated by AP to&#13;
subsidies and direct welfare programs. This is explained by two factors. First, a large proportion of&#13;
AP anti-poverty programs are related to broad-based, badly targeted current consumption programs,&#13;
and not to asset building and employment generation. Among Indian states, AP now has the highest&#13;
proportion of its non-interest expenditure allocated to such programs. Secondly, higher subsidy and&#13;
budgetary allocations for welfare programs has crowded out physical infrastructure expenditure.&#13;
Agricultural Performance&#13;
1.09   Economic Productivity. The economic performance of AP's agriculture lags behind that of&#13;
India and prices for all crops except tobacco lag behind national averages. Since agriculture is the&#13;
main activity inter-linked with other sectors, growth in rural economic output in AP is largely&#13;
dependent on removing policy constraints which either inhibit cultivation or depress farm-gate&#13;
prices. Despite relatively high crop yields, real economic productivity was not achieved in the 1980s&#13;
because of use of costly modern inputs. Due to the large size and importance of the agricultural&#13;
sector, agriculture has always been the main focus of AP government policy and budget: irrigation&#13;
infrastructure and agriculture have respectively received about 40% and 12-14% of total public&#13;
investment. Prior to recent reforms, agriculture received large irrigation and power subsidies which&#13;
amounted to 2.7% of the GSDP, or 7.1% of agricultural value added.&#13;
1.10   Agricultural Output. The cultivable area of 15.65 M ha comprises 57% of the State. The&#13;
net sown area (i.e. net of the fallow area) in 1989/90 was 11.09 M ha and utilized with a cropping&#13;
intensity is 120%. Food crops constitute about 64% of the cropped area and about 71% of these&#13;
crops are grown in the monsoon season. AP produced 7.2% of India's total foodgrains in 1989/92,&#13;
and is the fourth largest grain-producing state in India. With the exception of rice--whose area has&#13;
grown over the last decade--the cultivated area of all other cereals is declining in response to rising&#13;
prices of oilseeds, pulses, and cotton.&#13;
1.11   Expansion of irrigation has had a major impact on agricultural productivity and the share of&#13;
irrigation in gross sown area was 40% in 1993/94. Irrigated rice constitutes about 52% of the total&#13;
foodgrain area. Irrigation and agro-chemicals are a major factor in increasing agricultural output in&#13;
AP. The average fertilizer consumption per gross cropped area was about 119 kg/ha in 1991 (the&#13;
second highest in India after Punjab). AP's pesticide use is the highest of any state. Since 1989/90,&#13;
however, agricultural production has been stagnant due to the continued decline in canal command&#13;
area (para. 1.12). which, in turn, led to a fall in cropped area and fertilizer use.&#13;
Public Irrigation Scheme Management&#13;
1.12   Scope of Public Irrigation. With a total net area of 4.029 M ha under irrigation in 1993, AP&#13;
is the second largest irrigation state after Uttar Pradesh, and accounts for about 9% of the nation's&#13;
irrigated area. Its canal command net area of about 1.73 M ha is the second largest in India. The&#13;
composition of the net area under various irrigation sources in terms canals, tanks, wells and various&#13;
other sources was about 43%, 18%, 35%  and 4%  in that order.  Canal schemes are used&#13;
predominantly for rice and cotton production, comprising about 52% and 39% respectively of the&#13;
gross area crop irrigated. The areas irrigated by private wells are predominantly used for irrigation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
of most other foodgrains and cash crops. The net area under public surface irrigation reached a peak&#13;
of 2.9 M ha in 1990, but declined to 2.3 M ha by 1994 due to inadequate funding of O&amp;M.&#13;
1.13   The Irrigation &amp; Command Area Development Department. All public investment in&#13;
major and medium irrigation schemes, i.e. schemes larger than 2,000 ha (Map IBRD 18986RI)--&#13;
along with water resources planning, regional flood control and drainage, and construction of multi-&#13;
purpose reservoirs--are the responsibility of the Irrigation &amp; Command Area Development&#13;
Department (ICADD). Minor irrigation investments are undertaken by ICADD's Minor Irrigation&#13;
Department and the Rural Development and Agriculture Department. Private sector participation is&#13;
limited to private funding of wells and small pump schemes. On three major schemes covering a&#13;
substantial portion of the canal command area, canal water management and on-farm development&#13;
are undertaken by a Command Area Development Authority (CADA) under ICADD control. The&#13;
construction of hydroelectric plants for multi-purpose reservoirs is undertaken by the AP State&#13;
Electricity Board, which operates them in coordination with ICADD with respect to water release&#13;
regimes. ICADD's budget resource allocation emphasizes starting new major and medium projects&#13;
rather than rehabilitation of existing schemes. This leads to time and cost overruns due to the spread&#13;
of limited capital resources and upkeep of under-employed personnel.  Furthermore, zonal&#13;
restrictions on transfer or retrenchment of lower level staff prevent staff reduction when an ICADD&#13;
project is completed.&#13;
1.14  Irrigation Laws. AP has no comprehensive irrigation law. Up to 1984, there were two&#13;
regional Acts: the Irrigation Cess Act, 1865 applicable to the Rayalaseema and Coastal Region; and&#13;
the Telangana Irrigation Act 1948, applicable to the Telangana Region. The 1865 Act made it lawful&#13;
to levy irrigation water charges on an scheme constructed by government, and to regulate cultivation&#13;
in designated areas (localized land) by imposition of a penal cess for: (a) irrigation outside a defined&#13;
six month irrigation season; or (b) by interfering with water supply to other irrigators. The 1948 Act&#13;
extended these regulatory concepts to include seasonal prohibition crops such as rice on the basis of&#13;
their water requirement. However, most of the provisions under the 1948 Act have been superseded&#13;
by the Irrigation Utilization and Command Area Development (IU &amp; CAD) Act 1984. The 1984 Act&#13;
is applicable in any project placed under a CADA and enlarges ICADD's functions beyond water&#13;
management to include voluntary beneficiary participation and on-farm development. This Act has&#13;
not been effective in enforcing localization fostering voluntary beneficiary management, or&#13;
improving water management. Irrigation water charges for public schemes are levied under the 1988&#13;
Water Tax Act and are a function of crop type, season and size of scheme.&#13;
1.15   Localization. Irrigated areas in AP are classified as "Irrigated Wet" (IW) and "Irrigated&#13;
Dry" (ID) under a legal procedure known as "Localization". Under the 1984 Irrigation Utilization&#13;
and Command Area development Act, localization determines the water delivery regime that may be&#13;
supplied based on annual water availability, or a project planning policy of spreading the benefits of&#13;
irrigation as widely as possible by banning water intensive crops. This allows ICADD to prescribe&#13;
the season of irrigation for a canal, and the cropping pattern, period of sowing and crop duration&#13;
based on irrigation requirement considerations (IW, ID, double or perennial crop). Accordingly, IW&#13;
and ID localization designation of a canal command generally applies to either the monsoon and&#13;
post-monsoon seasons. In IW designated areas, all crops may be grown but farmers grow mostly&#13;
rice and sugarcane. In ID designated areas (usually lighter soils), rice and sugarcane are specifically&#13;
banned under the provisions of the 1984 Act because farmers in the canal head reaches would&#13;
prevent water from reaching the tail-end areas. Section 24(2) of the 1984 Act allows GOAP to alter&#13;
the Localization designation of an area if it wishes to advance the technology of land and water&#13;
management practices.&#13;
&#13;

Previous Bank Involvement and Lessons Learned&#13;
1.16   Previous Involvement in Irrigation. As of 9/30/95, the Bank commitment of US$492.91&#13;
million for 16 ongoing projects in AP was the fourth largest state project portfolio. In water&#13;
resources development, a Hyderabad Water Supply Project (Cr.2115-IN/Ln.3181 -IN), and&#13;
hydrological data network improvement under the multi-state Hydrology Project (Cr. 2774-IN)&#13;
accounted for US$91.35 M. Previous Bank support for four irrigation projects has played a major&#13;
role in the irrigation development of AP These are: (a) Pochampad Irrigation (Cr. 268-lN); (b)&#13;
Godavari Barrages (Cr. 532-IN); (c) AP Irrigation and Command Area Development Composite (AP&#13;
I) (Ln. 1251-IN); and (e) Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation (AP II) Project (Cr. 1665-IN/Ln. 2662-&#13;
IN). The National Water Management (NWM) Project (Cr. 2179-lN/Ln. 3260-IN) included an AP&#13;
component to demonstrate improved network designs in six medium schemes.&#13;
1.17   General Lessons Learned. The Pochampad, AP I and MWM projects provided valuable&#13;
lessons such as: (a) a canal system must be properly designed and constructed to deliver water to the&#13;
individual farm; (b) major and minor conveyance systems, and main drainage, must be built&#13;
simultaneously; (c) to ensure project viability, water should not be released for irrigation until the&#13;
minor system is ready to receive it; (d) the minor system, from government outlets to farm gates,&#13;
must be operated by farmers organized in water user associations (WUAs); (e) the need for full canal&#13;
lining and more attention to a project's agricultural aspects during supervision; (f) development of&#13;
realistic operational plans for water management and O&amp;M based on a prior diagnostic analysis; and&#13;
(g) increased training of irrigation staff in O&amp;M, and training of agricultural department staff and&#13;
farmers. The AP component of the NWM Project was not successful because attention was not&#13;
given to eliciting farmer agreement to de-localization of IW lands.&#13;
1.18   The Lessons of AP II. As the proposed project is a follow-on project to, inter alia, complete&#13;
AP II (para. 1.22), the key lessons] of AP II are important. The primary lesson is that a project will&#13;
not succeed unless it is well prepared and appraised. Project appraisal lessons include: (a) water&#13;
supply availability and reliability must be unambiguously established and command areas sized&#13;
accordingly, but consideration should be given to possible system expansion at a later date; (b)&#13;
detailed designs for major works must be available at appraisal and should be based on cost-effective&#13;
design alternatives, field surveys and sub-surface investigations; (c) appraisal cost estimates should&#13;
be based on prevailing contracting industry prices; (d) introduction of new methods of design and&#13;
canal management must be fully documented by appraisal to ensure their understanding and&#13;
acceptance by the Borrower; and (e) appraisal missions must review the implementing agency's&#13;
ability to control construction quality and ensure efficient operation and management. Project&#13;
implementation lessons are: (i) procurement of works contracts must follow a logical implementation&#13;
sequence to facilitate timely realization of planned benefits and permit program adjustments if&#13;
problems arise; and (ii) project implementation success depends on the establishment of viable&#13;
institutional arrangements for participatory beneficiary involvement, and particularly where water&#13;
delivery arrangements are to be changed, appropriate administrative frameworks must be in place to&#13;
implement the new system.&#13;

C. The Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation (AP II) Project&#13;
The AP II Sub-Projects&#13;
1.19   AP II Objectives and Canal Management Policies. The proposed project is a follow-on&#13;
operation to complete the Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project (AP II) and support irrigation&#13;
reforms in AP. Bank support for AP II (Credit 1665-IN/Loan 2662-N) consisted of a loan and credit&#13;
of US$131 million and SDR127.5 million to increase agricultural production by: (a) rehabilitation of&#13;
the existing 234,000 ha Sriramasagar Project (SRSP) command and its extension by another 34,000 ha&#13;
to km 284 of Kakatiya Canal (KKC); and (b) development of a new 65,000 ha command served by the&#13;
Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC). New water management principles were to be introduced to&#13;
implement GOAP's policy of equitable and cost-effective delivery of available water to a maximum&#13;
number of beneficiaries. These included: (i) reduced water allocation by "Irrigated Dry" (ID)&#13;
localization of land for all new command areas, and de-localization of "Irrigated Wet" (IW) land to ID&#13;
in SRSP; (ii) Rotational Water Supply (RWS), i.e. intermittent deliveries on a 7-14 day "on-off' basis&#13;
to outlets serving 40 ha blocks within which water would be distributed by farmer-managed Outlet&#13;
Committees according to a roster of pre-arranged turns; (iii) setting the capacity of irrigation outlets to&#13;
deliver a discharge proportional to the land area to be served according to the Structured Irrigation&#13;
Network concept of canal design and operation; (iv) throttling of oversized outlets and significant&#13;
elimination of uncontrollable direct farm outlets from large canals in SRSP; and (v) requiring rice&#13;
farmers on de-localized IW land to accommodate reduced and intermittent water deliveries by supply&#13;
augmentation from their private wells.&#13;
1.20   The SRBC Sub-Project. The SRBC command area is located in AP's Rayalaseema Region&#13;
and is situated along the west bank of the Kundu River, a tributary of the Krishna River (Map IBRD&#13;
18843R). The command area is about 130 km long and 5-10 km wide, with a cultivable command&#13;
area (CCA) of 77,000 ha. The area became potentially irrigable after completion of the Srisailam&#13;
Reservoir [live storage of 250 thousand million cubic feet (TMC)] on the Krishna River in the late&#13;
1970s. This reservoir was originally designed for hydropower generation only but was later&#13;
converted to a multi-purpose facility for water supply and irrigation. When SRBC was originally&#13;
conceived, all its water requirements were to be abstracted from the Srisailam Reservoir within 3-4&#13;
months during the monsoon season and conveyed over 70 km to the Gorakullu and Owk seasonal&#13;
storage reservoirs within the irrigation command. However, during the AP II appraisal these two&#13;
reservoirs were dropped. A description of the socio-environmental features of SRBC is given in&#13;
Annex 2 (paras 5-10). The SRBC planning history and Krishna River water allocation is described&#13;
in Annex 1.&#13;
1.21   The SRSP Sub-Project. The SRSP command is located in the Telengana Region of AP in&#13;
the Godavari river basin (Map IBRD 18842R). It is served by the Sriramasagar Reservoir on the&#13;
Godavari River. The upper portion of the command served by the Kakatiya Canal (KKC) was&#13;
originally developed up to KKC's km 113 under the Bank-supported Pochampad Project (para. 1.16).&#13;
By the early 1980s, GOAP had extended the KKC up to km 234 to create an irrigation potential of&#13;
323,000 ha. These works included construction of the Lower Mannair Dam (LMD) across the&#13;
Mannair River (a tributary of the Godavari River) at KKC's km 146 near Karimnagar. LMD&#13;
augments SRSP water supply by capturing the runoff from the Mannair River's free catchment and&#13;
serve as a balancing reservoir for SRSR. Under AP 11, the KKC was to be completed to km 284 and&#13;
its command extended to an additional 34,000 ha. A description of the socio-environmental features&#13;
of SRSP is given in Annex 2 (paras. 11 - 15) while its development history and Godavari River water&#13;
allocation are described in Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Causes of AP II Implementation Failure&#13;
1.22   Implementation Problems. AP II did not achieve its development objectives: by the time of&#13;
project closure no additional area was ready for irrigation in SRBC and SRSP. Many of the reasons for&#13;
AP II's poor implementation progress arose from delays in land acquisition, procurement difficulties&#13;
and litigation, staff changes, counterpart funding shortages, and limited logistics resources. Other&#13;
causes of delay were the technical differences that arose between the Bank and GOAP as a result of&#13;
inadequate project quality-at-entry (paras. 1.21 and 1.22). Furthermore, Bank funding was reduced&#13;
during the course of the project due to: (a) reallocation of SDR40.8 million to implement the AP&#13;
Cyclone Emergency Reconstruction Project (Cr. 1770-IN); and (b) cancellation of the entire loan by&#13;
1993 on the grounds of slow disbursement and Rupee devaluation.  Thus, despite improved&#13;
implementation in 1993/94, it was not possible to extend the project period as all Bank project funds&#13;
would have been disbursed by June 1994. These financing difficulties were partially overcome in&#13;
November 1993 when the Bank announced that: (i) it would consider supporting completion of AP II&#13;
works under a follow-on project, provided a satisfactory feasibility study was submitted by GOAP&#13;
resolving all outstanding issues; but that (ii) all interim procurement would be at GOAP's own risk. At&#13;
project closure, GOAP was left with contractual commitments of about US$118 million.&#13;
1.23   Resettlement &amp;  Rehabilitation (R&amp;R).  The AP II R&amp;R component provided for&#13;
retrospective actions to rehabilitate Project Affected Persons (PAPs) displaced by the construction of&#13;
the Srisailam Reservoir in the 1960s, and the Lower Mannair Dam in the 1970s and 1980s. However,&#13;
project effectiveness was delayed about 15 months till October 2, 1987 due to GOAP's inability to&#13;
submit a Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) satisfactory to the Bank, and only after the&#13;
Bank waived this effectiveness condition. Instead the Bank accepted a continuously evolving RAP&#13;
without defined action targets or a R&amp;R policy: thus at closure, it is not certain whether the R&amp;R&#13;
component fully achieved acceptable targets. No provision was made in the project RAP for PAPs&#13;
affected by canal or road construction as this was assumed to have insignificant impact.&#13;
1.24   Inadequate Public Consultation in SRSP. To ensure that the AP 1I water management&#13;
strategy (para. 1.16) would be undertaken in a systematic manner, GOAP was to introduce and apply&#13;
RWS and an ID water allocation regime (para. 1.15) in SRSP. Since rehabilitation and de-&#13;
localization would take time, a phased program was agreed whereby the whole IW area of 62,000 ha&#13;
above LMD would be converted to ID by June 1993. However, when the first Government Order&#13;
(G.O.) for de-localizing 5,299 ha from IW to ID in the Karimnagar district was issued in July 1987,&#13;
the district's public representatives opined that the conversion would entail hardship and financial&#13;
losses to the affected farmers, and petitioned GOAP to reconsider the matter.  Given that&#13;
maintenance of the status quo would defeat the whole purpose of the AP II project, a GOAP Expert&#13;
Committee upheld the project's water management principles (para. 1.19) but recommended that de-&#13;
localization would be slower with 80% of the de-localization to be undertaken during the last year of&#13;
the project prior to its closure on June 30,1 994. Thus, due to difficulties with rice cultivators, no&#13;
rehabilitation works were undertaken in SRSP and instead, only works to extend the command area&#13;
below km 234 of KKC were undertaken.&#13;
1.25   Design And Appraisal Inadequacies of SRBC. The technical and cost overrun difficulties of&#13;
SRBC implementation may be traced to Bank acceptance of a project prefeasibility study instead of a&#13;
feasibility study. Cost estimates were not based on detailed designs but on prefeasibility study&#13;
estimates, detailed operational hydrology assessments were not undertaken, and design altematives&#13;
were not based on detailed field studies and sub-surface investigations. The lack of prior canal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
alignment studies and detailed sub-surface investigation resulted in the SRBC main canal cost overruns&#13;
due to: (a) the frequent need to excavate in unanticipated rock outcrops; and (b) construction of&#13;
unforeseen high concrete walls to retain canal flow at locations where the main canal crossed flat&#13;
valleys. Since main canal alignment was not reviewed after dropping of the seasonal storage reservoirs&#13;
(para. 1.20), the Owk Tunnel and Owk Reservoir became inevitable. Furthermore, despite Bank review&#13;
of SRBC water availability during appraisal, Bank concerns about water availability became a major&#13;
issue and led GOAP to prepare simulation studies to reintroduce the Gorakulu and Owk reservoirs into&#13;
AP II (Annex 1).&#13;
Resolution of AP II Project Design Issues&#13;
1.26   Project Design Revisions. Preparation of the proposed project sought to apply the lessons&#13;
of prior Bank involvement in AP irrigation projects and those of AP II in particular (paras. 1.24-&#13;
1.25). The AP II project design was reviewed and modified to mitigate project implementation risks&#13;
and resolve planning issues. This included: (a) detailed feasibility studies, sub-project feeder road&#13;
traffic surveys (Annex 10, para. 34) and participatory rural appraisals to determine farmer irrigated&#13;
cropping pattern preferences (Annex 10, para. 15); (b) river basin and project simulation model&#13;
studies on water supply availability and reliability (Annex 1); (c) formulation of a R&amp;R policy and&#13;
action plans for rehabilitation of families affected by canal and road construction (paras. 2.40-2.47&#13;
and Annex 5), and completion of the AP II R&amp;R program for reservoir oustees (para. 2.48); (d)&#13;
improvement of detailed engineering designs (para. 2.13) and bid documents; (e) construction&#13;
quality assurance arrangements (paras. 2.26-2.28); (f) undertaking of a priori and fully documented&#13;
public consultations in SRSP regarding farner acceptance of project de-localization and rotational&#13;
water supply policies (Annex 14); (g) a framework for participatory irrigation management based on&#13;
turnover of tertiary irrigation networks to registered WUAs (paras. 2.32-2.36, paras. 4.01-4.05 and&#13;
Annex 3); (g) an improved framework for project operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) organization,&#13;
management and funding (para. 2.19, paras. 4.06-4.08); (h) an improved irrigation agronomy and&#13;
extension program (paras. 2.29-2.31); (i) an expanded staff and farmer training program (paras. 2.37-&#13;
2.39); (j) environmental impact analysis and environmental management plan (paras. 2.49-2.52 and&#13;
Annex 2); and (k) statewide increase of irrigation water charges (paras. 4.09-4.11 and Annex 11).&#13;
The need for investments to ensure the safety and sustainability of project reservoirs that had became&#13;
apparent during AP II led to inclusion of a dam safety component (paras. 2.21-2.25). Particular&#13;
attention was given to project performance indicators (para. 4.35), implementation monitoring&#13;
arrangements (paras. 4.3 8-4.41) and required project staffing schedules (Annex 8).&#13;
Investigation of Scheme Design Alternatives&#13;
1.27   SRBC (Annex 1). The water availability issue was resolved by a GOAP simulation model&#13;
of the existing and proposed schemes and facilities in the AP portion of the Krishna Basin. The&#13;
model examined various planning options related to the size of SRBC command area and the need&#13;
for off-channel storage reservoirs to ensure its water supply reliability. It was found that--under full&#13;
anticipated development of the Krishna river basin--a 75% annual water supply reliability to SRBC&#13;
would be ensured to a command of 65,000 ha with an Owk Reservoir of reduced capacity (para.&#13;
2.11). Water availability for SRBC should not be a sub-project viability issue. To ensure that&#13;
adequate priority would be allocated to seasonal water supply to SRBC, appropriate operating rules&#13;
were developed for Srisailam Reservoir and institutionalized by a Government Order (para. 4.18).&#13;
1.28   SRSP (Annex 1). Water availability and command area size alternatives were reviewed by&#13;
means of a simulation model which focused on water supply reliability to the existing and proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
extension of the command below LMD. The model results clearly indicated that supply reliability to&#13;
any extension of the existing command area would be unacceptably low given upstream riparian&#13;
water rights and the limited storage capacity of the Sriramasagar Reservoir. Thus the proposed&#13;
project would only undertake rehabilitation of the existing SRSP command and not support&#13;
completion of the 34,000 ha extension begun under AP II except for retrospective R&amp;R of families&#13;
affected by land acquisition for AP II SRSP network extension works. The model also exhibited&#13;
sensitivity to overall irrigation efficiency which should attain about 40% if water supply to the below&#13;
LMD command is to have a reliability of 75%. Consequently, in addition to public consultations&#13;
regarding the RWS policy, a Government Order for de-localization of the command to an ID supply&#13;
regime was issued prior to negotiation of the proposed project. The delocalization was required to&#13;
ensure the irrigation efficiency improvements expected under the project from network&#13;
rehabilitation, RWS and introduction of water distribution by WUAs to achieve water distribution&#13;
equity and control wasteful irrigation (para. 2.18).&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Rationale, Objectives and Components&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.01   Irrigation Sector Reform. In line with the India CAS (para. 1.04), the Bank has been engaged&#13;
in a dialogue with GOAP about fiscal measures to alleviate its irrigation sector financial crisis.&#13;
Subsequent statewide public consultations on irrigation water charges resulted in GOAP issuing an&#13;
Ordinance for an unprecedented increase in irrigation water charges. A complementary increase in&#13;
O&amp;M budgets is also being considered. Dialogue with GOAP has also set in motion an ICADD&#13;
organizational reform process including plans to place tertiary irrigation networks under beneficiary&#13;
control through participatory irrigation management (PIM) institutions. Having adopted a PIM Policy,&#13;
GOAP is engaged in the formation of autonomous WUAs throughout the public irrigation sector.&#13;
GOAP is also addressing the management and operational performance problems in ICADD. Since the&#13;
project is intended to serve as pilot for GOAP's strategies of decentralized management and beneficiary&#13;
empowerment, promotion of this effort via the project would be consistent with the Bank's irrigation&#13;
lending strategy for India (para. 1.05). Involvement in the project at this juncture would strongly&#13;
support GOAP's irrigation sector reform program and enable the Bank to maintain an irrigation policy&#13;
reform dialogue with India's second largest irrigation state.&#13;
2.02   Rural Infrastructure Development. The Bank's support for the project would contribute to&#13;
GOAP's high priority goals of improving the performance of upland irrigation schemes and their&#13;
expansion (paras. 1.09 and 1. 16). The economic potential created by AP 11 investments have yet to be&#13;
tapped, and Bank financing as a "lender of last resort" would help make this possible. The Bank's&#13;
involvement would significantly reduce the time it would take GOAP to complete the AP II works&#13;
using its own meager resources. The project would also support the safety and sustainability of two&#13;
multi-purpose reservoirs of vital regional importance and also facilitate the execution of an otherwise&#13;
unaffordable environmental conservation initiative. Thus, Bank support to increase rural productivity&#13;
in an environmentally sustainable manner would contribute to improved economy and efficiency in&#13;
public expenditure. The project has a potential for rural transformation: thus Bank involvement would&#13;
thus support GOAP's strong political-economic commitment to poverty alleviation (para. 1.06) and&#13;
contribute to raising the family incomes of marginal and small farmers--who comprise the majority of&#13;
project beneficiaries--above the official poverty threshold.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
2.03   The primary objective of the project would be to complete ongoing irrigation development and&#13;
scheme rehabilitation works begun under Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project and thus realize the&#13;
potential for increasing agricultural productivity and rural incomes in two economically backward&#13;
regions of Andhra Pradesh. The other objectives would be to: (a) pilot implementation of management&#13;
reforms to improve public irrigation performance by facilitating beneficiary participation in the&#13;
operation and maintenance of major irrigation schemes, and upgrade GOAP capacity to improve&#13;
irrigation services and command area management; (b) retrospectively mitigate the adverse impacts of&#13;
land acquisition under the Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project, and proactively provide economic&#13;
rehabilitation for those families still to be affected by completion of SRBC works; (c) ensure the safety&#13;
and sustainability of three dams supplying water to the project areas; (d) implement a mandated&#13;
regional program of environmental improvements, safeguards and natural resource conservation; and&#13;
(e) improve GOAP monitoring and evaluation capability for large externally aided irrigation projects.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
2.04   The proposed project would incur a base cost of US$434.06 million over a five and one half&#13;
year period to implement the six components needed to achieve project objectives. A summary&#13;
description of these components follows below while their detailed features are given in Section B to D&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
2.05   Irrigation Development and Rehabilitation Works (Base Cost US$346.32 million). This&#13;
component consists of two sub-projects as follows:&#13;
* SRBC Sub-Project (Base Cost US$166.14 million). The SRBC component would support&#13;
completion of the scheme including all civil works begun under AP II. Structures and activities&#13;
include: (a) completion of sections of the main canal and the Gorakullu By-Pass Siphon; (b)&#13;
construction of the Owk Tunnel and Owk seasonal storage reservoir; (c) lined irrigation network for&#13;
65,000 ha; (d) drainage system and on-farm development; and (e) completion of feeder roads begun&#13;
under AP II and about 50 km of new feeder roads.&#13;
* SRSP Sub-Project (Base Cost US$180.18 million). The SRSP component would support the&#13;
rehabilitation of 165,000 ha of irrigation system above the Lower Mannair Dam (LMD) and 88,000&#13;
ha of existing network below LMD up to km 234 of Kakatiya Canal. Necessary works and&#13;
activities include: (a) selective rehabilitation of canal lining and structures of Kakatiya Canal up to&#13;
km 234; (b) rehabilitation and modemization of the existing irrigation network (inclusive of on-&#13;
farm development and drains where necessary); and (c) completion of feeder roads begun under AP&#13;
II and about 50 km of new feeder roads.&#13;
The base costs of each sub-project include the following common implementation activities and&#13;
investments: (i) procurement of equipment for communications, construction quality assurance&#13;
laboratories and O&amp;M organization; (ii) construction quality assurance training of construction&#13;
supervision staff and irrigation training of O&amp;M staff, (ii) establishment of a computerized&#13;
Management and Information system; and (iv) surveys, studies and technical assistance.&#13;
2.06 Agricultural Support Service Programs (Base Cost US$10.71 million). The component&#13;
would support programs for improving the technical performance and productivity of irrigated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
agriculture. The Irrigation Agronomy Program for SRBC and SRSP includes: (a) applied research and&#13;
demonstration of irrigation practices and agronomy to improve irrigation practices and crop yields; (b)&#13;
upgrading of the agricultural extension services in SRSP; and (c) program of applied research,&#13;
demonstrations and extension to promote high value horticultural crops. The WUA Promotion Program&#13;
includes: (i) completion of a pilot program to develop WUA frameworks, training modules and joint&#13;
system management modalities involving 32 WUAs in SRSP; (ii) implementation of an Action Plan to&#13;
establish WUAs for the whole command areas of SRBC and SRSP; (iii) technical assistance by NGOs&#13;
for the WUA program; and (iv) studies of indigenous irrigation institutions in SRBC and SRSP. The&#13;
Farmer Training Program  includes: (i) provision of training facilities and courses in irrigation&#13;
agronomy to ICADD staff and farmers; and (ii) irrigation and management training courses for ICADD&#13;
staff and WUA office holders.&#13;
2.07   Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) Program (Base Cost US$21.81 million). This&#13;
program provides for economic rehabilitation of the families of three groups of Project Affected&#13;
Persons (PAPs) and their major (adult) children adversely affected by past and proposed land&#13;
acquisition for SRBC and SRSP works. This includes: (i) retrospective assistance to about 6,000 PAPs&#13;
(including their 2,787 major children) affected by land acquisition for canals and roads under the AP 11&#13;
project; (ii) rehabilitation of about 500 PAPs (including their 244 major children) to be affected by&#13;
SRBC canal works under the project; (iii) assistance to 778 "below poverty line" reservoir oustee&#13;
families who were not assisted under the AP R&amp;R component; and (iv) PAP vocational training for&#13;
income generating schemes. The program would also complete the AP 1I R&amp;R component's program&#13;
of provision of community facilities and house plots for reservoir oustees in 104 resettlement villages.&#13;
2.08   Environmental Management Plan (Base Cost US$32.48 million). This component supports&#13;
a GOI mandated regional program of environmental safeguards and nature conservation in command&#13;
area districts. It includes: (a) compensatory afforestation; (b) improvement and protection of six Forest&#13;
Reserve areas and two wildlife sanctuaries; (c) establishment of an LMD bird sanctuary and fish&#13;
farm; (d) catchment area treatment programs to mitigate reservoir sedimentation ; (e) an&#13;
environmental health program; (f) construction of three environmental education centers and&#13;
establishment of project environmental monitoring units; and (g) an SRSP agro-forestry program.&#13;
2.09   Dam Rehabilitation and Safety Assurance (Base Cost US$20.28 million). This component&#13;
supports investments to: (i) maintain the structural and mechanical integrity of Sriramasagar, Lower&#13;
Mannair and Srisailam dams; and (ii) works to prevent failure of the Srisailam dam spillway.&#13;
2.10   Project Monitoring and Evaluation (Base Cost US$2.47 million). This component provides&#13;
for strengthening of ICADD's Project Preparation and Monitoring Unit.&#13;
B. Detailed Features of Irrigation Investments&#13;
SRBC Civil Works&#13;
2.11   Main Canal (Annex 2, Figure 1). The partially completed main canal, flows south along&#13;
hillsides for 50 km  before reaching the partially completed  Gorakullu  By-Pass (GBP)&#13;
aqueduct/siphon and the irrigation command. Beyond GBP, the canal flows for about 63 km&#13;
commanding about 41,000 ha divided into 11 irrigation blocks (of which two are under&#13;
construction). Between km 113.6 to km 119.5, new conveyance system investments consist of: (a)&#13;
the 2 km long Owk Tunnel and (b) the linkage of two existing irrigation tanks by low dams and a&#13;
central spillway to create the 1.9 TMC capacity Owk seasonal storage reservoir. The existing tanks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
command about 670 ha under rice cultivation and provision is made for a reliable supply to this area.&#13;
A pumping station at Owk Reservoir is provided to fully evacuate reservoir dead storage every year.&#13;
After Owk Reservoir, the existing main canal continues for about 26 km. Five irrigation blocks&#13;
covering 24,000 ha would be constructed to complete a total command area of 65,000 ha.&#13;
2.12   The main canal works and GBP are divided into eleven ongoing construction contracts&#13;
begun under AP II and continued through 1994-1996. With the exception of GBP, these works are in&#13;
an advanced stage of completion and have been inspected in June 1996 by an independent&#13;
construction quality audit team to certify their eligibility for retroactive financing. The planning,&#13;
subsurface investigations and designs for the Owk Complex (tunnel and reservoir) have been&#13;
continuously monitored and reviewed by an independent Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP). The&#13;
Owk Complex is divided into 3 contract packages based on detailed designs and bid documents&#13;
reviewed by an experienced construction specialist.&#13;
2.13   Irrigation Network. Management and control of canal flow is based on Rotational Water&#13;
Supply (RWS) (i.e. "on-off' alternate supply periods of at least 7-10 days each) and structure designs&#13;
suited to the "structured irrigation network" (SIN) principle. The SIN principle provides no gated&#13;
structures below the head of a minor canal serving 2,000-4,000 ha and which is to flow at full design&#13;
discharge during each irrigation period. Distribution canals for the 16 irrigation blocks offtake from&#13;
the main canal through head regulators located adjacent to, or upstream of a main canal cross-&#13;
regulator. The head regulators are equipped with manually operated undershot gates, however&#13;
consideration will be given to installation of overshot gates for more reliable control. Technical&#13;
assistance would be utilized to analyze the viability of this possible innovation. In order to facilitate&#13;
efficient conveyance (including partial reduction of seepage losses), maintenance and canal&#13;
sustainability in Black Cotton Soils, the canal network utilizes a lined section down to a discharge of&#13;
about 0.028 cumec (1 cusec). Since the distribution network is aligned predominantly on swelling&#13;
Black Cotton soil, the lining is to be placed on a compacted layer of cohesive non-swelling (CNS)&#13;
soil of appropriate thickness (based on standard field investigation of soil swelling properties).&#13;
2.14   The irrigation network has been divided into 16 contract packages. Construction of Blocks&#13;
IV and VIII was begun in 1994 and is ongoing and were found eligible for retroactive finance by the&#13;
construction quality audit. These blocks were originally to be lined to a I cumec capacity only: thus&#13;
the works for lining to a 0.028 cumec capacity will be a separate contract to be bid during the&#13;
project. Irrigation water is to be supplied to watercourses through adjustable proportional module&#13;
(APM) and open flume module (OFM) outlets to ensure that each 30-40 ha watercourse command&#13;
receives a flow in proportion to its size. No direct outlets will be allowed from the main canal. The&#13;
APMs and OFMs are capable of being shut by sliding shutters if some watercourse commands do not&#13;
wish to draw water after heavy rainfall: hence all minor canals are also to have a tail-escape structure&#13;
into the main drainage network.&#13;
2.15   The project will assist farmers in laying out the micro-network within a watercourse&#13;
command and with the lining the first 10 m of each watercourse. Separate contracts will be used for&#13;
drainage and watercourse command on-farm development works. The latter are to be begun about&#13;
nine months prior to the completion of civil works in each irrigation block and their designs would&#13;
be vetted by farmers after preparation by consultants. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
all micro-network designs for each watercourse command ("chak") in SRBC would be completed by&#13;
consultants at least 15 months prior to completion of each irrigation network works contract, and that&#13;
these designs would be reviewed and accepted by the prospective beneficiary farmers prior to&#13;
initiation of the micro- network works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
SRSP Civil Works&#13;
2.16   Scope. Rehabilitation and modernization works are to be undertaken in two command areas&#13;
(Annex 2, Figure 2): "above LMD"(km 0-146 of KKC) and below "LMD" (km 146-234 of KKC).&#13;
The works are grouped under a number of contract "packages": a package being either a specific&#13;
length of Kakatiya Canal (KKC) and/or a portion of the command area--normally a distributary canal&#13;
command or part of one, an area of watercourse command development and/or an area of drainage&#13;
works. There are 16 rehabilitation packages above LMD covering an existing area of 165,000 ha and&#13;
7 rehabilitation and network completion packages below LMD covering 88,000 ha. One package&#13;
above LMD and three packages below LMD are ongoing works begun under AP II which are&#13;
deemed eligible for retroactive financing by the construction quality audit.&#13;
2.17   Kakatiya Canal Rehabilitation and Improvements. The conveyance capacity of KKC is&#13;
about 40% below its nominal design discharge of 243 cumec because of damaged lining, channel&#13;
side slope slips, neglected silt deposition etc. Many of the mechanical appurtenances in its&#13;
regulating structures are also in poor condition or barely operable. Simulation studies (Annex 1)&#13;
have indicated that, unless its capacity is restored after rehabilitation of the command above LMD, it&#13;
will not be able to convey monsoon surplus water stored in the SSR to LMD for irrigation of the area&#13;
below LMD. As per the designs prepared under AP II, the KKC discharge capacity is to be restored&#13;
and increased from 243 cumecs to 274 cumecs from km 0 to km 146 by increasing the full supply&#13;
depth of the canal by 0.46 m and raising the canal lining. KKC also requires repairs to its existing&#13;
lining in many reaches and completion of some structures.&#13;
2.18   Distribution Network Rehabilitation. The design for the rehabilitation of the irrigation&#13;
network is based on introduction of RWS and remodeling of structures according to SIN principles&#13;
and is otherwise similar to that of SRBC (para. 2.13). Accordingly, all SRSP lands have been de-&#13;
localized to ID irrigation (para. 1.15). The number of gates are therefore to be reduced, and suitable&#13;
SIN structures are to be provided. About 30% of the lined network is aligned through Black Cotton&#13;
soils where lining is to be placed on a CNS soil layer. Where possible, small distributaries are to be&#13;
linked to enable efficient water control and canal regulation. Many outlets for these small areas are&#13;
oversized and would be throttled to reduce their excessive and wasteful discharges, while all&#13;
watercourse pipe outlets would be replaced by APM or OFM modules. All broken structures and&#13;
mechanical appurtenances are to be repaired. Prior to Negotiations, GOAP issued a Government&#13;
Order de-localizing all SRSP command lands up to km 234 of Kakatiya Canal to ensure the viability&#13;
of RWS implementation.&#13;
2.19   Interim Repairs and Maintenance. Currently only about Rs.19/ha/year is allocated for&#13;
maintenance for the SRSP scheme as a whole. Consequently, much deferred maintenance needs to&#13;
be carried out (such as desilting and small structure repairs) just to keep the remaining network in&#13;
minimal running order prior to completion of rehabilitation. The pilot WUA establishment program&#13;
has shown that with minor repairs and farmer cooperation under a WUA framework, the irrigated&#13;
area could be increased by as much as 20-28%. GOAP has therefore issued a Government Order in&#13;
1995 allocating a sum of Rs217.1 million for interim repairs to be spent over a period of 7 years&#13;
beginning in FY95/96. As an incentive for farmers to form WUAs, all deferred maintenance works&#13;
would be undertaken by WUAs under contract with ICADD. However, as irrigation network and&#13;
main canal contracts in SRBC and SRSP are completed, normal O&amp;M expenditure would be&#13;
provided with project assistance on a declining scale (para. 3.18)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Rural Feeder Roads&#13;
2.20   The AP II program for construction and upgrading of SRBC and SRSP feeder roads to&#13;
provide all-weather access to villages having a population of over 1,000 would be completed under&#13;
the project. Thus no part of the irrigated portion of the sub-project areas would be further than 3-4&#13;
km from an all-weather road. To date, 107 km have already been completed under AP II: therefore&#13;
about 50 km of new roads would be undertaken in each of sub-project command areas respectively.&#13;
The feeder roads would conform to GOAP design standards satisfactory to the Bank. These include:&#13;
(a) 3.5 m wide roads with surfacing of water-bound macadam and no black topping; and (b)&#13;
construction of hard passages instead of concrete bridges over seasonal streams. The sub-grade&#13;
design would be according to requirements dictated by forecast rural traffic (typically 15 cm deep)&#13;
and the foundation according to California Bearing Ratio criteria. To ensure that planning, design&#13;
and construction of the road sub-component can progress unhindered, an assurance was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that, by October 1, 1997, and thereafter by April I of every year, GOAP would submit&#13;
to the Bank/IDA for review: (i) plans for the extent of the sub-project road reserves to be acquired&#13;
for development in the following or subsequent construction season; and (ii) detailed designs, cost&#13;
estimates and bid documents satisfactory to the Bank/IDA for the roads to be newly constructed.&#13;
Dam Safety Works and Assurance&#13;
2.21   The dam safety component for project reservoirs has been prepared by ICADD on the basis&#13;
of DSRP site visits and recommendations from 1988 to 1996. These were compiled into two 1995&#13;
Notes on Dam Safety and Sustainability and a 1996 summary report entitled Dam Safety Assurance&#13;
and Rehabilitation - Identification Report (Annex 14). The latter report summarizes the project&#13;
program and outlines a general dam safety assurance program for all dams in the state.&#13;
2.22   Srisailam Dam Spillway Safety. The plunge pool downstream of Srisailam dam's ski-jump&#13;
spillway is becoming scoured and the possible progressive movement of the scour upstream could&#13;
endanger the foundation of the ski-jump bucket. The consequent exposure of the weak seams&#13;
occurring in dam's foundation may adversely affect the gravity dam's safety against sliding. The&#13;
two outer gates of the spillway cannot be opened because of dangerous erosion of the river valley hill&#13;
slopes by flaring of the spillway water trajectory. Thus spillway modifications are also needed to&#13;
ensure dam safety against large floods.&#13;
2.23   Based on model tests, the solution suggested by the DSRP envisages construction of: (a) a&#13;
coffer dam for dewatering the plunge pool; (b) construction of a toe wall with its top about 2-3 m&#13;
above the bed and its foundation firmly anchored into hard rock to a depth of about 2 m; and (b) the&#13;
space between the toe wall and existing apron would be filled with concrete up to 3 m thick, and&#13;
covered with a 3 m thick concrete blanket firmly anchored in rock with passive anchors. Model tests&#13;
indicate that construction of a divide wall on the downstream spillway face and bucket adjacent to&#13;
the non-overflow 'river sluice' block could curb the spillway water jet flaring problem.&#13;
Implementation of these solutions will require: (i) assessment of the magnitude and extent of the&#13;
existing scour by detailed inspection of the plunge pool by underwater photography; and (ii) a&#13;
feasibility study including analysis of construction methods. Technical assistance from international&#13;
experts would be sought evaluate the feasibility study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
2.24   Sriramasagar Dam and LMD River Sluices Repair. Silt has accumulated behind the six&#13;
river sluice gates of Sriramasagar dam and thereby jamming them completely (one river sluice of&#13;
LMD has been similarly jammed). These gates are now inoperable, cannot function as permanent&#13;
low-level outlets and also compromise structural safety since emergency gates were never installed.&#13;
The immediate silt will have to be removed by deployment of desilting machinery (e.g. mini-&#13;
dredgers) and divers are needed to clear the gate grooves to make them operable. Some gates may&#13;
have to be replaced, but due to the height of accumulated silt it may be necessary to block the sluice&#13;
tunnels permanently: the need for this contingency would be determined by dam safety studies.&#13;
2.25   Dam Sustainability. A number of investigations and improvements have been identified by&#13;
the DSRP to ensure the sustainability of the Srisailam, Sriramasagar and Lower Mannair dams.&#13;
These activities, to be undertaken under DSRP supervision, would include: (a) detailed structural&#13;
behavior, dam deformation and instrumentation studies for Srisailam Dam; (b) installation of&#13;
additional structural and uplift pressure monitoring instrumentation and devices; (c) modernization&#13;
of disposal of internal drainage water in the dams and provision of ventilation in their internal&#13;
inspection galleries; (d) petrographic analysis of rock and concrete samples (including coring of&#13;
samples) to check alkali-aggregate reactivity potential; (e) procurement of lightweight pneumatic&#13;
diamond core drilling machines and compressors for reaming of choked drainage holes in foundation&#13;
galleries; (f) field and laboratory equipment for concrete leaching investigations to mitigate the&#13;
clogging of porous concrete drains which drain seepage water from the dam body; and (g) technical&#13;
assistance to undertake a Probable Maximum Flood studies.&#13;
Construction Quality Assurance Plan&#13;
2.26   Laboratory Equipment.  ICADD has prepared an Action Plan for Quality Control&#13;
Organization (Annex 14) to cope with the increased construction supervision load that would be&#13;
generated by the large number of construction contracts that would be simultaneously active in&#13;
SRBC and SRSP. In addition to defining the duties, functions and numbers of staff required by the&#13;
Quality Control Units (para. 2.27), this Plan also provides for upgrading of inadequate central and&#13;
field laboratory equipment and facilities based on the listing of cement, concrete, aggregate, steel and&#13;
soil tests to be performed by these laboratories (Annex 9). The existing four laboratories in SRSP&#13;
are to be expanded into three central laboratories and four field laboratories (for routine daily tests).&#13;
Because of the more compact nature of the SRBC scheme, upgrading of the existing central&#13;
laboratory is proposed with routine tests being carried out by three mobile field laboratories.&#13;
Detailed lists of the laboratory equipment required are given in the Quality Control Action Plan.&#13;
2.27   Supervision Staff Training (Annexes 4 and 9). Because it involves new major works,&#13;
SRBC requires highly trained supervisory staff if quality assurance is to be achieved by supervisory&#13;
staff. The project has already benefited from participation of 20 SRBC engineers in a National&#13;
Council for Cement and Building Materials (NCCB) course in concrete construction practice. Under&#13;
a Training Program (Annex 14) prepared by ICADD it is proposed that the NCCB training program&#13;
would continue under the project and include 60 and 150 SRBC and SRSP officers respectively. The&#13;
program would include 'hands-on' and 'on-the-job' training to construction and quality control&#13;
personnel. This would be followed by periodic quality audits and re-training. The training program&#13;
envisages 16 three-day Quality Control and Assurance courses for 20 Supervisory Engineers (SEs)&#13;
and Executive Engineers (EEs) per course at the AP Water and Land Management Training and&#13;
Research Institute (WALAMTARI) campus over a five years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
2.28   Contract Management. In addition to the extant Quality Control Manual, Quality Audit&#13;
Guidelines and an 'OK Card' system have been introduced during project preparation with salutary&#13;
results. The OK Card system is a pro-forma check-list of all tasks, installation and construction&#13;
activities associated with each structure and separate civil construction type for each contract. The&#13;
cards are inspected by quality control staff and are duly signed and remarked upon by both&#13;
supervision and contractor representatives when each work is ready for execution and upon its&#13;
completion. These procedures would be continued under the project. In addition to the above, a&#13;
training program envisages 16 three-day Contract Law and Administration courses for 20 SEs and&#13;
EEs per course at the WALAMTARI campus over a five year period. An understanding was reached&#13;
at negotiations that the OK Card system would be followed by GOAP and maintained.&#13;
C. Detailed Features of Agricultural Support Service Programs&#13;
Irrigation Agronomy Program&#13;
2.29   Applied Research and Demonstrations. Irrigation agronomy in SRSP would be improved&#13;
by an active program of applied research on farmer's fields with the objective of evolving and&#13;
demonstrating profitable diversified cropping sequences for horticultural and 'dry' crops (e.g. maize,&#13;
cotton and sunflower) under an RWS regime. Extension 'messages' would be developed with&#13;
respect to optimal crop wetting and time of application, improved field irrigation techniques,&#13;
fertilizer and agro-chemical application, and use of improved cultivars and varieties. The program&#13;
would be undertaken along two selected distributaries above and below LMD respectively over a&#13;
period of five years. Each distributary would have three 40 ha sites at selected locations along its&#13;
upper, middle and lower reaches: thus the test area would total 240 ha. There would also be&#13;
sprinkler and drip pressurized irrigation demonstration plots of 2 ha each. These sites would&#13;
preferably be where WUAs have been organized and would be selected jointly by ICADD,&#13;
Department of Agriculture (DOA) and farmers' representatives. A third test area of 120 ha would be&#13;
selected in either Block IV or Block VIII of SRBC depending on which is completed first.&#13;
2.30   Lists of required vehicles, laboratory and field equipment and necessary farm implements&#13;
have been prepared. The sub-component would require temporary recruitment (for 5 years) of 3&#13;
research associates and 3 data recorders. Aside of extension to disseminate findings, a Farmer&#13;
Exchange Program would form part of the demonstration strategy. Under this program, funding is&#13;
provided over a five year period to arrange 2-day observation visits of 2,700 selected farmers from&#13;
new and rehabilitated commands to research stations and other commands.&#13;
2.31   Upgrading of SRSP Extension Services. The existing agricultural extension service would&#13;
be strengthened in the area of irrigation water management, systematic land development, and credit&#13;
for land leveling through cooperatives and banks. The Contact Farmer approach of the Training &amp;&#13;
Visits (T&amp;V) system was found to be ineffective and has been replaced by more effective mass&#13;
contact through regular large group meetings and exhibitions.  Participatory Rural Appraisal&#13;
techniques for eliciting farmer feedback would be an element of the extension approach. The&#13;
compulsory fortnightly Village Extension Officer (VEO) orientation and training meetings of the&#13;
T&amp;V system would be maintained to ensure uniform and timely extension message transfer. Andhra&#13;
Pradesh Agricultural University (APAU) staff would participate in bimonthly workshops organized&#13;
by the agricultural research stations in the command to deal with location-specific problems, and to&#13;
maintain a linkage to the concurrent applied research program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Water User Association Promotion Program&#13;
2.32   WUA Promotion Strategy. Based on GOAP's PIM Policy (paras. 4.01-4.02 and Annex 3),&#13;
ICADD has prepared an Action Plan for the Promotion of Farmers' Organization in Irrigation&#13;
Management of Sriramsagar and Srisailam Right Branch Canal Projects (Annex 14). The Action&#13;
Plan target is phased establishment of 472 autonomous WUAs covering 256,000 ha in SRSP and 150&#13;
WUAs covering 69,000 ha in SRBC. Each WUA will be responsible for: (a) manage the minor canal&#13;
command under its control to equitably deliver water supplied under a RWS regime to each&#13;
irrigation block outlet; and (b) maintain its canal network. The Action Plan provides a generic model&#13;
format of WUA Bye-Laws and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for partial management&#13;
transfer. Both documents have been reviewed and found satisfactory to the Bank. Copies of these&#13;
model documents are exhibited in Annex 3. Each WUA will be governed by an elected executive&#13;
committee of nine members and include a President, Treasurer and Secretary.&#13;
2.33   GOAP's decision to attempt joint management and partial transfer of irrigation networks to&#13;
farmers is based on a phased process-oriented strategy of coordination of the many administrative,&#13;
organizational, financial and institutional supporting actions to achieve turnover initially at the minor&#13;
canal level. The process-oriented approach focuses initially on the effectiveness of the different&#13;
decision-making processes in achieving satisfactory performance. Accordingly, the generic WUA&#13;
framework currently being piloted in SRSP (para. 2.35) with 32 WUAs would be modified as&#13;
necessary on the basis of experience and success. Management transfer would concentrate on&#13;
establishing WUAs with jurisdiction over 400-750 ha by associating defunct voluntary Outlet&#13;
Committees into a WUA on the basis of maximum social homogeneity within a single "Revenue&#13;
Village" if possible.&#13;
2.34   A second phase of participative management would involve consolidation of WUAs into a&#13;
larger organization at higher levels for managing a portion of the larger irrigation system. The&#13;
WUAs would be expected to federate into apex committees on a distributary level (Distributary&#13;
Committees) so as to provide a coordinating function for member WUAs and ICADD staff. At&#13;
Command Area Development Authority (CADA) level in SRSP (and later in SRBC), a reconstituted&#13;
CADA Board would be responsible for overall scheme management (paras. 4.04-4.06) along with an&#13;
executive committee of composed of representatives of Distributary Committees.  When the&#13;
minor/distributary is handed over to a WUA, ICADD involvement would consist of technical advice.&#13;
Other government support such as training, extension and management support would be provided as&#13;
needed to further strengthen WUA participation in decision-making processes and foster a sense of&#13;
partnership. It is envisaged that successful WUAs may amalgamate to enter into marketing,&#13;
transport and agro-processing ventures.&#13;
2.35   Implementation Approach. Mass education and motivation campaigns would be organized&#13;
in the project area. For SRSP, a consultative process in relation to system rehabilitation diagnostics&#13;
would be carried out with respect to designs, outlet locations, the direct outlet problem etc. Training&#13;
modules to facilitate implementation are being developed under the ongoing pilot program. The&#13;
MOU defining WUA rights and responsibilities and the WUA bye-laws would be finalized in a&#13;
democratic manner during WUA establishment, and support arrangements would be adapted to local&#13;
conditions. The generic framework of latter aspects are being developed in an ongoing 2-year pilot&#13;
program for 17,021 ha in SRSP with the assistance of two experienced NGOs. The NGOs are&#13;
working in collaboration with WALAMTARI to develop location-specific training materials and&#13;
modules.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
2.36   The programs for WUA establishment in SRSP and SRBC (Annex 3) would vary in detail&#13;
because of basic differences in scheme type (rehabilitation only in SRSP and introduction of&#13;
irrigation in SRBC), local established practices and perceptions. The common framework includes:&#13;
*  Social Preparation and Socio-Anthropological Studies. Motivation camps and meetings in each&#13;
village to promote WJUAs with audio-visual aids, training materials and direct discussion over a&#13;
period of 6-9 months. In this period, irrigators would be identified, WUA boundaries would be&#13;
finally determined and potential members who can serve as office bearers and training needs&#13;
would be identified. GOAP is of the view that local indigenous farmer organizations (such as&#13;
those for tank irrigation), and their linkages and community roles, need to be understood and&#13;
integrated or associated with the WUA framework. Two such studies by consultants will be&#13;
undertaken in SRSP and one in SRBC.&#13;
*  WUA Formation. In this process, WUA representatives would be selected through the existing&#13;
village structures and other functional organizations. The working modalities, responsibilities,&#13;
functions, duties would be formalized as bye-laws for the WUA. The WUA's relations with&#13;
ICADD would be determined by a MOU. Training would begin in this period which is expected&#13;
to take 3-4 months.&#13;
*  WUA Legal Registration. WUAs would be required to register as legal entities under AP's&#13;
Societies or Cooperatives Acts, or under appropriate provisions of the 1984 IU &amp; CAD Act&#13;
(para. 1.14). Although the choice of registration modality will be left to WUA members,&#13;
guidance will be provided based the experience gained under the ongoing SRSP pilot program.&#13;
Prior to registration, 51% of farmers in terms of numbers or landholdings must be enrolled as&#13;
members of the WUA.&#13;
*  Financial Arrangements. WUA financial sustainability is proposed to be achieved primarily&#13;
through the efforts and initiative of its members, but the modalities to be finally used will depend&#13;
on the findings of the ongoing pilot program and the evolution of GOAP's initiative to require&#13;
WUA formation on all public irrigation schemes. WUA revenue options being considered&#13;
include: (i) individual membership fee payment on a per ha basis for upkeep of the irrigation&#13;
network and administrative costs ; (ii) a commission to collect water rates and benefit from a&#13;
rebate of 40% thereof (para. 4.10), or government support by earmarked sharing of the per ha&#13;
O&amp;M budget for the scheme; and (iii) initial managerial support grant of Rs.275/ha over three&#13;
years available from a GOI PIM program. GOAP policy at present is to minimize dependence&#13;
on direct government subventions and rely on incentives for WUA formation to foster self-&#13;
reliance based on beneficiary empowerment.&#13;
*  Consultative Process. In SRSP, the system rehabilitation and watercourse improvement designs&#13;
prepared by ICADD would be reviewed with the affected WIUA members prior to their&#13;
procurement. Seasonal canal closure periods to facilitate rapid completion of works would be&#13;
explained. This would also involve the issue of controlling irrigators served by direct outlets&#13;
from a large canal: it is proposed that these irrigators would be placed under WUA jurisdiction&#13;
under the provisions of the MOU. In SRBC, the system and watercourse designs would be&#13;
explained to prospective irrigators and their inputs sought through existing organizations. An&#13;
2   E.g. a one time initial membership payment of Rs.250/ha to be held in a fixed deposit interest bearing&#13;
account yielding Rs.30/year/ha to be used for maintenance;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
assurance was obtained at negotiations that, prior to the award of any SRSP contract for&#13;
rehabilitation of the irrigation network, the beneficiary farmers would be consulted on the&#13;
modifications to the tertiary network designs with respect to relocation of irrigation outlets to&#13;
farm watercourses or farm block watercourses, and shall take into account the views of&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
* WUA Establishment. ICADD and NGO Social organizers would provide technical assistance to&#13;
WlUAs for 2 years (including the preparatory period) after which they are expected to be self-&#13;
sufficient enough to discharge their obligations as per the MOU. During this period, the SRSP&#13;
WUAs would be expected to undertake emergency repairs and works with the funding provided&#13;
for this purpose (para. 2.19). The WUA establishment program will be implemented by&#13;
WALAMTARI, NGOs and trained SRSP CADA staff. An NGO Adviser will be retained&#13;
according to terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank at the state level to provide support on&#13;
WVUA establishment and operation.&#13;
Farmer Training Program&#13;
2.37   Training Infrastructure. At present, WALAMTARI has a campus in Hyderabad, four&#13;
farmer training centers (FTCs) in SRSP and one in the SRBC area. Since the available training&#13;
facilities and infrastructure are inadequate, in addition improving the training facilities and&#13;
infrastructure at existing FTCs, the project would support establishment of two new FTCs in SRBC&#13;
and one additional FTC in SRSP. GOAP has prepared a Training Implementation Plan in which all&#13;
equipment lists, course details and proposed expenditures are specified.&#13;
2.38   Extension Training.  An extension staff training plan has been prepared for VEOs,&#13;
Agricultural Development Assistants (ADAs) and Agricultural Officers (AOs) in SRSP and SRBC.&#13;
The training would be conducted by staff of the WALAMTARI with inputs from APAU. Staff from&#13;
Officer level and above would be sent to the WALMTARI campus for training in water use&#13;
management, while tailor-made courses for VEOs and ADAs would be organized on site as off-&#13;
campus courses at regional agricultural research stations. This program envisages 24 basic and&#13;
refresher courses for 364 VEOs, ADAs and AOs over a five year period.&#13;
2.39   WUA Training. Training is a key element of the WUA Promotion Program. The five year&#13;
program of training courses by WALAMTARI and NGOs would cover all WUA office bearers,&#13;
selected contact farmers, agricultural officers and ICADD staff involved in the WUA promotion&#13;
process. Sixteen 3 day workshops on PIM and WUAs would be offered at the WALAMTARI&#13;
campus for a total of 480 senior engineers and agricultural officers. The sub-project FTCs would&#13;
provide: (a) 600 WJUA courses for a total of 18,000 SRSP WUA members and 360 courses for&#13;
10,800 SRBC WUA members; and (b) 32 farmers' participation and public relations courses for 960&#13;
ICADD and agriculture staff at or below Deputy EE and AO rank posted to SRBC and SRSP.&#13;
D. Detailed Features of Social and Environmental Programs&#13;
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) Program&#13;
2.40   Land Acquisition. The total amount of land required for all project works, including roads,&#13;
amounts to 7,981 ha, including 4,877 ha of land already taken over for the project since 1985 and&#13;
3,104 ha to be acquired for the proposed project. Of the total amount of land required, 6,479 ha is&#13;
privately owned land, of which 4,030 ha have already been acquired and 2,449 ha are at different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
stages of acquisition. Compensation for land was paid in line with the Land Acquisition Act (LAA)&#13;
of 1894, amended in 1984. This compensation proved inadequate and many landowners sought and&#13;
received redress of grievances in the courts. GOAP issued Negotiations Committee Rules in 1992,&#13;
stipulating the constitution of Negotiation Committees and procedures for negotiated compensation&#13;
with landowners affected by land alienation for public projects. Persons whose land acquired after&#13;
1992 received consent awards. Thus, for land still to be acquired, GOAP will seek utilize the&#13;
Negotiation Committee procedure to pay land compensation at the prevailing land market value in&#13;
addition to entitlements under para. 2.44. For trees, structures and other assets to be acquired,&#13;
replacement value will be paid. If the negotiations fail to result in consent awards, the affected&#13;
person could resort to the legal proceedings under the LAA.&#13;
2.41   Eligible Project Affected Persons (PAPs). New irrigation commands potentially improve&#13;
the livelihood of all command area population: thus loss of a small area of dry land to canal&#13;
construction would be offset by increased income from the remaining holding. Thus PAPs are&#13;
defined by the project R&amp;R Policy as including all persons who have lost--or stand to lose--a&#13;
"minimum economic loss" of his/her land, including land utilized under customary usufruct rights,&#13;
and is either left with less than a "minimum economic holding", or whose income has fallen below&#13;
the state's poverty line due to land acquisition. The "minimum economic loss" of holding is&#13;
considered to be loss of 25% of the holding size on the date of Notification under the LAA, while a&#13;
"minimum economic holding" (MEH) is defined as I ha of irrigated land or 2 ha of dry land. The&#13;
PAP definition also includes landless persons, dependent on manual labor and living below the&#13;
state's poverty line, whose livelihoods have been adversely affected due to alienation from land or&#13;
property upon which such livelihood previously depended. Persons suffering less than a minimum&#13;
economic loss would receive normal compensation under the LAA (para. 2.40).&#13;
2.42   PAP Categories (Including Scheduled Tribes). The following population categories are&#13;
eligible for R&amp;R benefits under the project: (a) land holders and their families losing at least a&#13;
minimum loss of their land holdings, or otherwise relegated to the official BPL livelihood category&#13;
by past or future land acquisition; (b) landless persons (such as tenants, sharecroppers and&#13;
encroachers) and their families losing at least a minimum loss of their cultivated land; and (c) the&#13;
major children of PAPs of either sex who are more than 18 years of age, irrespective of his/her&#13;
marital status, at the time of the socioeconomic survey. Two specific categories of PAPs entitled to&#13;
additional benefits are: (a) those who lose any of their homestead land or are otherwise displaced&#13;
from their village as a result of land acquisition; and (b) PAPs belonging to Scheduled Tribes who&#13;
are entitled to replacement of land [para. 2.44(a)] in addition to all rehabilitation benefits. In the&#13;
SRBC area, Scheduled Tribes constitute about 2.2% of the total population and 1.2% of the PAPs; in&#13;
SRSP, Scheduled Tribes comprise about 15.5% of the project area population and about 10% of PAP&#13;
households. In both cases, Scheduled Tribes are engaged in farming and are project beneficiaries,&#13;
and accordingly no separate Tribal Development Plan has been prepared.&#13;
2.43   Number of PAPs. Independent consultants conducted detailed socioeconomic surveys in&#13;
the project affected areas on the basis of the approved R&amp;R Policy. The surveys were satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank and completed: (a) verification of the extent of land and other assets acquired under AP II&#13;
and to be acquired by the project; and (b) identification of individual PAPs in each category and their&#13;
socio-economic profile. Thus the total number PAPs is about 6,500 scattered in 308 villages and&#13;
includes 3,031 major children at the time of the socio-economic survey in 1994. The sub-categories&#13;
include: 121 PAPs who have lost their houses/homesteads; about 675 PAPs rendered landless; about&#13;
311 PAPs that became functionally landless (i.e. losing so much land that they ceased farming); 7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
tenant PAPs; and 61 PAPs belonging to Scheduled Tribes of which 49 will get replacement land. and&#13;
all are farmers who would be irrigation beneficiaries.&#13;
2.44   R&amp;R Entitlements and Benefits (Annex 5). The R&amp;R Policy aims at improving, or at least&#13;
restoring, the living standards of PAPs by providing--along with irrigation benefits--an assistance&#13;
framework for replacement of lost assets and economic rehabilitation activities. Thus, in addition to&#13;
mandatory compensation under the LAA, the following entitlements are provided under the R&amp;R&#13;
program to PAPs:&#13;
(a) Land-for-Land Option. Replacement land of comparable quality will be provided to PAPs&#13;
through allotment of government land or ceiling surplus land to the extent of their loss up to a&#13;
limit of 2 ha of dry land or I ha of irrigated land, preferably in the same revenue village.&#13;
Preference will be given to persons belonging to the weaker sections. In the case of PAPs&#13;
belonging to Scheduled Tribes: those rendered landless will be given 2 ha of new land while&#13;
those losing part of their holding would be given replacement land&#13;
(b) Economic Support Package. In case of unavailability of nearby government land, a package of&#13;
economic support programs will be implemented to purchase productive assets for income&#13;
generation. The package will consist of the following ex-gratia grants:&#13;
(i) Productive Asset Grants. The following grants are available for PAP categories:&#13;
- Rs.8,000 to each PAP that has obtained judicial awards under LAA grievance procedures&#13;
in the past, or whose land has been acquired under the consent award system after 1992;&#13;
- Rs.8,000 for all major children of each PAP (irrespective of PAP category);&#13;
- Rs.13,000 for each PAP that has not obtained judicial or consent award for their land;&#13;
and&#13;
- Rs. 16,000 for each PAP rendered landless or functionally landless by the project.&#13;
(ii) Womens' Thrift Group Grants. Women groups of PAP spouses will be organized for&#13;
income generation activities. Financial assistance will be provided to each group of 15&#13;
women at Rs.15,000 (i.e. Rs.1,000 per spouse).&#13;
(iii) Vocational Training. Each PAP will be provided Rs.3,000 for vocational training linked&#13;
with relevant economic activities for himself/herself or family members.&#13;
(iv) Maintenance Allowance. Each PAP will be given a maintenance allowance at Rs.500 per&#13;
month for nine months irrespective of whether his/her land was acquired in the past or would&#13;
be acquired in future. He/she will also be given a smokeless stove (chulla) at project&#13;
expense.&#13;
(v) Cattle Maintenance Allowance. Each PAP will be given a cattle maintenance allowance at&#13;
Rs.200 per month for 6 months irrespective of whether his land has been or will be acquired.&#13;
Each PAP may pool his productive assets grant together with that of one or all of his major&#13;
children to purchase land or income generating assets such as livestock, machinery or equipment.&#13;
The grants will be held in joint bank accounts and released only for an approved income&#13;
generating scheme. Maintenance and cattle allowances may also be deposited in the joint&#13;
account for income generating schemes if a PAP so desires.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
(c) Homestead Land and House Construction Allowance. Each PAP family losing its house or&#13;
homestead will be provided 200 m2 of developed land for homestead land and Rs.14,000 for&#13;
house construction with provision of free transport facility to the new site.&#13;
(d) Access To Government Programs. The R&amp;R Policy states that PAPs may also be provided&#13;
access to ongoing GOAP welfare programs such as: (i) subsidized rice schemes; (ii) Scheduled&#13;
Caste and Scheduled Tribe development programs; (iii) employment guarantee and assurance&#13;
programs; (iv) provision of protected drinking water; (v) adult literacy programs; (vi) Integrated&#13;
Rural Development Program (IRDP) and Development of Women and Child in Rural Areas&#13;
(DWCRA).&#13;
2.45   Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans. Based on the above R&amp;R Policy framework,&#13;
GOAP prepared separate economic rehabilitation action plans (ERAPs) for each sub-project's PAPs&#13;
affected by the construction of main canals, distributary canals and farm roads constructed prior to&#13;
and under AP II, as well as the small number of families that will be adversely affected by&#13;
construction of the SRBC command area. The ERAPs contain detailed planning of rehabilitation&#13;
activities, including household-oriented economic activities, training programs, organizational&#13;
arrangements, community mobilization through NGO facilitation and monitoring mechanisms. In&#13;
preparing the ERAPs, the consultants have planned R&amp;R activities by villages and consulted each&#13;
PAP about his/her preferences for income-generating schemes. The ERAPs were found to be&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
2.46   Village Rehabilitation Action Plans. To orient R&amp;R implementation towards each village&#13;
containing a significant number of PAPs, 95 Village Rehabilitation Action Plans (VAPs) are to be&#13;
prepared during project implementation on the basis of a sample VAP included in the ERAPs. This&#13;
will provide an opportunity for further consultation with the PAPs in refining the PAP-specific&#13;
income generation activities and promote PAPs' participation in planning and implementing of their&#13;
R&amp;R programs. VAPs will further confirm the identified economic activities and detail all PAP-&#13;
specific rehabilitation measures on the basis of the following factors: (a) village resources potentials&#13;
and PAP skills; (b) linkages with government programs; (c) support needs for carrying out income&#13;
generation activities, including new skills, financial services and market analysis; and (d) training&#13;
needs for PAPs with different income generation schemes.&#13;
2.47   R&amp;R Training.  Each ERAP contains a training program to ensure successful R&amp;R&#13;
implementation in facilitating all income generating schemes and women group economic activities.&#13;
R&amp;R staff training and PAP vocational training would be provided as follows:&#13;
*  Training for Engineers. Training for 20 engineers will cover R&amp;R policy and the R&amp;R program&#13;
to raise their awareness to R&amp;R issues and help resolve difficulties and conflicts in R&amp;R.&#13;
*  Orientation Training For Rehabilitation Officers &amp; NGOs. The training of Rehabilitation&#13;
Officers and NGOs is aimed at upgrading their skills, familiarizing them with R&amp;R planning and&#13;
R&amp;R implementation planning. The training would be implementation and problem-oriented&#13;
and will be conducted in working sessions in highly participatory manner. R&amp;R officers at the&#13;
state level and consultants previously involved in the R&amp;R planning would deliver the training&#13;
on the R&amp;R Policy's entitlements and rehabilitation activities, while NGOs would provide the&#13;
training in community mobilization.  Training topics would include the following: (a)&#13;
community mobilization techniques; (b) income generation schemes in various sectors; (c)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
identification and verification of all developmental schemes; (d) organization of womens' thrift&#13;
groups; (e) operation of joint accounts and disbursement; (f) identification of training programs&#13;
for youths; (g) risk analysis of various economic schemes and possible measure to prevent and&#13;
correct them; and (h) R&amp;R monitoring arrangements&#13;
Training For PAPs. The success of income generation programs is crucial to the R&amp;R target of&#13;
improving and restoring the living standards of the population adversely affected by the project.&#13;
As most of the identified schemes are new to the PAPs, they require new knowledge, techniques&#13;
and skills to carry out the schemes. The ERAPs provide for training of about 3,440 PAPs in&#13;
nearby training centers. Detailed vocational training programs, trades and schedules would be&#13;
provided in the Village Action Plans. PAP training would cover the following topics: (a)&#13;
technical skills required for different trades; (b) maintenance of productive asset; and (c)&#13;
womens' group economic activities. A total of 5,063 women would receive training to facilitate&#13;
success of their womens' thrift group income-generating schemes.&#13;
2.48   AP II Reservoir R&amp;R Remedial Action Plans. A Remedial Action Plans (RAP) was&#13;
prepared for retrospective completion of residual works and rehabilitation begun under the AP II&#13;
project for the displaced families in the resettlement villages of the Srisailam and Lower Mannair&#13;
Reservoirs. The RAP is based on a detailed survey in the 104 resettlement villages to evaluate the&#13;
status of the infrastructure (roads, electrification drinking water needs, primary education facilities,&#13;
medical and veterinary service facilities and other community buildings) provided under AP II and&#13;
determined residual requirements. The Remedial Action Plan includes three components as follows:&#13;
e  Infrastructure Provision. The survey identified remedial works according to planning norms and&#13;
proposed the following groupings of investments: (a) balance works which are incomplete and&#13;
required to be completed as per the R&amp;R Action Plan of AP II; (b) improvements needed for&#13;
improved utilization of the facilities already provided in the resettlement villages; and (c)&#13;
additional facilities which are required as per the perceptions of the village population.&#13;
*  Free House Plots. Free house plots are to be provided to the homeless people in the 104&#13;
resettlement villages. The survey has identified 2,231 people without houses, 379 in the 81&#13;
Srisailam Reservoir resettlement villages and 1,852 in the 23 LMD oustee villages. GOAP will&#13;
provide each homeless family with 200 m2 of developed homestead land free of cost.&#13;
* Income Generation Schemes. Due to the absence of detailed surveys for the AP II R&amp;R&#13;
component, the survey could not identify the 778 PAPs in the 23 LMD villages who had not&#13;
received their income generation scheme benefits under AP II. Therefore the RAP's income&#13;
generation programs would target the poorest 778 families in the 23 resettlement villages of&#13;
Lower Mannair Reservoir.&#13;
An assurance was obtained from GOAP at negotiations that the R&amp;R program would be&#13;
implemented according to the provisions of paras. 2.40-2.48 above and the R&amp;R Targets and Actions&#13;
matrix in Annex 5.&#13;
Environmental Management Plan (Annex 2)&#13;
2.49   Potential Environmental Impacts.  The project has been designated as falling into&#13;
Environmental Category 'B'. Five principal types of environmental impact are potentially of&#13;
concern in the development of SRBC and rehabilitation of SRSP. These impacts are: (a) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
potential for soil waterlogging and secondary salinization due to rise of the groundwater table as a&#13;
result of canal irrigation; (b) loss of reservoir storage through sedimentation caused by watershed&#13;
degradation; (c) increase in malaria and waterborne diseases; (d) loss of forest land due to reservoir&#13;
and canal construction; and (d) adverse impact on flora and fauna as a result of construction of&#13;
irrigation canals. Separate EIA studies analyzing the above potential impacts for SRBC and SRSP&#13;
were compiled by consultants and submitted to the Bank in May 1994 as part of the initial project&#13;
feasibility study. These studies were based on existing and new surveys of soils, land use, flora and&#13;
fauna, and on specialized groundwater monitoring investigations and analysis undertaken by&#13;
GOAP's Groundwater Department (GWD).&#13;
2.50   Environmental Clearances. In order to receive national environmental clearance for the&#13;
project, GOAP prepared a Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan&#13;
(EMP) for both SRBC and SRSP according to national guidelines in March 1995. However, prior to&#13;
according its clearance in March 1996, MOEF required that the EMP include several natural&#13;
resource and nature conservation programs which would benefit the sub-project districts. The need&#13;
for these interventions are not attributable, for the most part, to any adverse impact caused by&#13;
irrigation works per se, but ensuring that development would not impinge on, or affect, natural&#13;
resource and wildlife assets in the project area's districts, and raising its population's environmental&#13;
awareness.&#13;
2.51   Impact Assessment. No irreversible, diverse or complex adverse impacts were found by the&#13;
MOEF review committee in either of the sub-project command areas which would change the&#13;
project's 'B' environmental category rating accorded by the Bank. Given GOAP's obligation to&#13;
carry out the regional EMPs, they have been included as a monitorable investment under the project.&#13;
Bank missions confirmed GWD's assessment that waterlogging and secondary salinization would&#13;
not be caused by a rise of groundwater tables into the crop root zone except, possibly, in isolated&#13;
pockets. The EMP has provision was made for promotion of groundwater development and&#13;
conjunctive use to mitigate such impacts if they arise (Annex 2, paras. 16-25).&#13;
2.52   EMP Components. The EMP for the SRBC and SRSP sub-project areas includes: (a)&#13;
compensatory afforestation of 1,910 ha of in degraded areas; (b) eco-restoration programs consisting of&#13;
habitat protection and infrastructure improvements in the Pakhal and Rollapadu bird and wildlife&#13;
sanctuaries, afforestation of 2,100 ha of degraded areas in Forest Reserves, establishment of three&#13;
environmental education centers and an LMD Bird Sanctuary, and anti-poaching units; (c) catchment&#13;
area treatment programs consisting of 55,102 ha of afforestation and soil conservation measures to&#13;
reduce sedimentation of the Srisailam, Sriramasagar and LMD reservoirs; (d) improved prophylactic&#13;
programs for prevention of waterbome diseases such as immunization of 13,600 children in SRBC,&#13;
chlorination, anti-mosquito spraying and establishment of mobile health units and dispensaries; (e)&#13;
agroforestry extension support consisting of distribution of 100,000 teak stumps and 20,000 fruit tree&#13;
seedlings and establishment of two mobile extension units; (f) 275 km of canal plantation and&#13;
construction site restoration measures; (g) establishment of a fish farm at LMD; (h) two environmental&#13;
monitoring and evaluation units; (i) support for anti-poaching vigilance arrangements; (j) continuation&#13;
of groundwater monitoring programs in SRBC and SRSP command areas; and (k) farmer conservation&#13;
training. Further detailed descriptions of these components is given in Annex 2.&#13;

III. COST ESTIMATES, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
Cost Estimates&#13;
3.01   Project Cost Summary. The total project costs over a five and one half year period are&#13;
estimated at US$477.43 million including physical and price contingencies (US$43.36 million). This&#13;
amount includes foreign exchange costs of about US$50.11 million (10.5% of the total cost) and about&#13;
US$52.98 million for taxes and duties (11% of the total cost). Table 3.1 gives a summary of project&#13;
costs by component. Detailed summary cost tables including a breakdown by expenditure categories&#13;
are given in Annex 6. Detailed project cost tables are available in the Project File (Annex 14).&#13;

3.02   Cost Estimate Assumptions. The estimated base costs are given in 1996 prices. The cost of&#13;
ongoing civil works eligible for retroactive financing are based on the actual tender costs, while the&#13;
costs new civil works have been based on the GOAP "Schedule of Rates" adjusted upward by 30% to&#13;
cater for market conditions. The unit costs of equipment and vehicles are based on prices quoted by&#13;
suppliers. Physical contingencies of 10% are included for the ungrounded civil works. Price&#13;
contingencies for foreign exchange costs are based on annual international inflation estimates of 2.5%&#13;
in 1996, 1.7% in 1997, 2.2% in 1998, 2.6% in 1999, 2.8% in 2000 and 2.6% in 2001. Likewise for&#13;
local costs, the annual local inflation rates used are: 6.0% in 1996; 7.0% in 1997; 6.7% in 1998; 6.5% in&#13;
1999 and 6.0% in 2000 and thereafter. No price contingency was allowed for retroactive funding (para.&#13;
3.16) of project expenditures in FY 95/96 and FY96/97.&#13;
Financing&#13;
3.03   Financing Plan. Bank support would consist of an IDA Credit of SDR108.10 million&#13;
(US$150 million equivalent) and an US Dollar Loan of US$175 million at the IBRD variable interest&#13;
rate, and include up to SDR30.50 million (US$42.25 million equivalent) for retroactive financing (para.&#13;
2.17). Thus the Bank would finance about 68 percent of total project costs (77 percent net of duties and&#13;
taxes), or the equivalent of 100 percent of the foreign exchange component and 73 percent of the local&#13;
costs net of taxes and duties. The remaining 32 percent of expenditures (US$152.43 million) or 23&#13;
percent of expenditures net of taxes and duties (US$99.45 million) would be funded by GOAP. The&#13;
financing plan is summarized in Table 3.2 below: Detailed tables with a breakdown of components by&#13;
expenditure categories and by financiers are given in Annex 7.&#13;

3.04   Financing Conditions. The project would be completed in about five and half years by July&#13;
31, 2002 and would be closed on January 31, 2003. The loan/credit would be made available to GOI on&#13;
standard IDA/IBRD terms and conditions, and on-lent to GOAP by GOI under GOI's standard terms&#13;
and conditions for developmental assistance to the states with GOI assuming the foreign exchange and&#13;
interest rate risks. Under current GOI policies, on-lending to GOAP takes the form of a 30% grant and&#13;
70% loan at the interest rate of 13% per annum. The first half of the loan is recovered by GOI over 10&#13;
years without a grace period, whilst the second half is recovered by GOI over a period of 20 years,&#13;
including a grace period of 5 years.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.05   Non-Bank Finance (US$53.03 million). This includes expenditures for land acquisition&#13;
(US$13.90 million), engineering survey and administration (US$34.33 million) and operating costs&#13;
for the agricultural support services and the EMP (US$4.80 million), which would be fully financed&#13;
by GOAP. This expenditure category would be incurred for the existing staff of the ICADD,&#13;
WALAMTARI, and other agencies involved in agricultural extension and the EMP.&#13;
3.06   Civil Works (US$371.62 million). Bidding for civil works contracts would not attract&#13;
foreign bidders due to the relatively small size of the individual contracts for irrigation works, feeder&#13;
roads, and buildings. Therefore all civil works would be procured through National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB) using standard bid documents, Direct Contracting, Quotations and Force Account as&#13;
follows:&#13;
* National Competitive Bidding (US$350.09 million). All irrigation civil works and feeder roads&#13;
(74 packages of which 77% are over US$100,000 and above), O&amp;M upgrading and about 110&#13;
buildings would be procured using standard NCB bid documents and procedures satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank/IDA. Post-qualification criteria satisfactory to the Bank/IDA would be used for these&#13;
contracts with the exception of the Owk Tunnel and Owk Reservoir in SRBC where&#13;
prequalification would be required. Foreign contractors would be fully eligible to participate.&#13;
*  Direct Contracting/Ouotations/Force Account (US$21.53 million.). Scattered soil conservation&#13;
works in inaccessible locations, O&amp;M works support on a declining scale (para. 3.18) and&#13;
command area development (watercourses, land leveling and field drainage), valued individually&#13;
at US$20,000 equivalent or less up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$21.53 million, are&#13;
not suitable for NCB. These would be procured following procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank/IDA either through: (a) Direct Contracting with non-governmental organizations and&#13;
WUAs; and (b) quotations solicited from at least three qualified contractors (unit rate/piece rate&#13;
system). Force Account would only be used in a manner satisfactory to IDA/Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
3.07   Afforestation (US$ 20.07 million). All the compensatory afforestation, the green belt and&#13;
reservoir plantation, degraded forest rehabilitation and canal bank plantation would be carried out&#13;
under a unit/piece rate system, or under force account as a last resort, by the Forestry Development&#13;
Corporation, and Departments of Forestry and Agriculture.&#13;
3.08   Goods and Equipment (US$16.76 million). Standard bidding documents (Supply, Supply-&#13;
cum-Erection) would be used for both ICB and NCB. All contracts for goods, equipment and&#13;
materials costing US$250,000 or more (totaling about US$7.40 million) would be awarded following&#13;
ICB procedures with a domestic preference for national suppliers.  Contracts, not exceeding&#13;
individually US$250,000 and in aggregate about US$3.31 million, would be procured following&#13;
NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank/IDA.  Isolated or small lot purchases including, in&#13;
particular, immediate requirements of equipment individually costing the equivalent of US$25,000&#13;
or less up to an aggregate of US$1.02 million would be procured following National Shopping&#13;
procedures. Items costing less than US$250,000 equivalent, which are not locally available would be&#13;
procured through International Shopping. All goods and equipment for PAP income-generation&#13;
schemes (US$4.03 million) are to be procured by local shopping with project assistance so as to be&#13;
eligible for reimbursement. Disbursements against such purchases of goods and equipment would be&#13;
made subsequent to eligible expenditures on the basis of supporting documents furnished to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
3.09   Vehicles (US$0.80 million). Vehicles would consist of 40 cars, jeeps and vans and 42&#13;
motorcycles. All contracts for vehicles under the project would be procured under national shopping&#13;
procedures as procurement would involve different types of vehicles. Such national shopping would&#13;
primarily involve the use of Director General, Supplies and Disposal (DGS&amp;G) rate contracts.&#13;
Contracts for hire of vehicles up to an aggregate of US$2.1 million equivalent would be procured&#13;
through quotations from three domestic suppliers.&#13;
3.10   Training, Technical Assistance and Studies (US$11.25 million). These comprise of: (a)&#13;
farmer and project staff training (US$4.15 million); and (b) consultantcy services (US$4.91million)&#13;
and studies (US$2.19 million). Except the training carried out by WALAMTARI and other&#13;
concerned implementing agencies, all training would be carried out largely by local professional&#13;
institutions and NGOs and procured through direct contracting. All technical assistance and studies&#13;
would be contracted on terms and conditions in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Selection&#13;
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated January 1997. Consulting firms&#13;
would be selected by "Quality- and Cost-based Selection" procedures. Short lists for small&#13;
assignments costing less than US$100,000 may consist entirely of national consulting firms. NGOs&#13;
to assist with R&amp;R and WUA formation would: (a) have to meet the NGO selection criteria in Annex&#13;
13; and (b) NGO services costing less than US$ 100,000 may be procured on a single source selection&#13;
basis when (i) an assignment is small, and (ii) the NGO has local experience and/or is exceptionally&#13;
qualified. Individual national or foreign consultants may be contracted as per the Guidelines. An&#13;
assurance was obtained from GOAP at negotiations that it would select NGOs in accordance with&#13;
criteria agreed with the Bank/IDA (Annex 13).&#13;
3.11   R&amp;R Program and Recurrent Costs (US$4.90 million). These expenditures comprise of:&#13;
(a) incremental staff salaries, allowances and operating expenditures for PPMU (US$2.20 million);&#13;
(b) vehicle hire charges (US$2.10 million); and (c) R&amp;R administration (US$0.60 million). No&#13;
disbursements would be made for incremental salaries and operating costs of the agricultural and&#13;
environmental management plan components valued at US$4.80 million equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
3.12    Review  of Contract Award.  Prior Bank/IDA  review will be required for procurement&#13;
actions of: (a) all contracts for civil works valued at US$300,000 and above; (b) goods and&#13;
equipment and vehicles valued at US$200,000 and above; (c) all consultancy contracts valued at&#13;
US$100,000 and above (US$50,000 for individual consultants); and (d) all single source consultancy&#13;
contracts over US$100,000 equivalent. All other contracts would be subject to random post review&#13;
in the field by visiting missions. This would result in over 75% of the project procurement being&#13;
subject to prior review. Both GOAP and ICADD have had recent prior experience with Bank/IDA&#13;
procurement procedures.&#13;

3.14   Procurement Procedure. To ensure efficient procurement, the following understandings&#13;
were recorded at negotiations:&#13;
(a) As a minimum, all bid invitations would be advertised in newspaper with national circulation&#13;
and shall contain the key post-qualification requirements in summary form. Bid documents&#13;
shall be provided promptly upon request, upon payment of the prescribed fee, and shall be&#13;
sent by mail upon request.&#13;
(b) During pre-bid conferences, bidders would be advised about: (i) Conditions of Contract&#13;
related to "Technical Expert" adjudicator for large civil works, default provisions, post-&#13;
qualification requirements, etc.; (ii) streamlined processing to elicit competitive bidding; and&#13;
(iii) the high likelihood of being declared unresponsive if all qualification data and securities&#13;
are not provided in bid documentation.&#13;
(c) Bids shall be evaluated within 30 days of bid opening and recommendations for contract&#13;
award should be forwarded to the Bank/IDA for review where necessary (prior review)&#13;
within 60 days thereof, and all contracts would be conveyed to the successful bidder within&#13;
the bid validity period of 90 days. Any justifications for extension of bid validity shall be&#13;
cleared with the Bank/IDA to preclude forfeit of financing for bids not awarded within a&#13;
reasonable time.&#13;
3.15   Procurement Management. The procurement process would be coordinated by the Project&#13;
Preparation and Monitoring Unit (para. 4.14). Bids would be evaluated by the concerned Chief&#13;
Engineer of SRBC or SRSP and a Bid Evaluation Report would be forwarded to the State&#13;
Commissionerate of Tenders (COT) chaired by the ICADD Chief Engineer for clearance. The&#13;
PPMU would ensure that suitably qualified individual(s) are designated to prepare a signed and dated&#13;
Bid Evaluation Report following a format and content acceptable to the Bank/IDA. COT procedures&#13;
and efficacy would be monitored by the Project Empowered Committee (para. 4.12) and if found&#13;
wanting, the Project Empowered Committee would undertake procurement management. ICADD's&#13;
semi-annual reports (para. 4.38) would contain summarized procurement data for each contract, the&#13;
dates of bid invitation, receipt, evaluation, approval and signing, and the names of contractors&#13;
bidding, offer prices, and firm awarded the contract.&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
3.16   Amount and Eligibility Period. Implementation of civil works contracts in the two sub-&#13;
project areas procured under AP II according to Bank/IDA Guidelines has continued since the&#13;
project's closure on June 30, 1994 (para. 1.19). These works have been monitored by the Bank&#13;
during project preparation and have been subject to an independent construction quality audit in June&#13;
1996. The audit team certified that the works were of a high standard, and that the project quality&#13;
assurance procedures and controls (para. 2. 28) were sustainably implemented. Thus, to reimburse&#13;
GOAP for part of these expenditures, the Bank/IDA has approved retroactive financing of 13% of&#13;
the loan/credit amount for up to SDR30.5 million (US$42.25 million equivalent) for eligible&#13;
expenditures incurred by GOAP after February 28, 1995.&#13;
3.17   Escrow Account. It was agreed during appraisal that GOAP would deposit 50 percent of the&#13;
payment on account of retroactive financing of civil works in an escrow account to be used&#13;
exclusively for financing of GOAP's contribution to project financing. Not only would this&#13;
dedicated account serve to reduce the fiscal burden on GOAP during its proposed fiscal adjustment&#13;
program, but it would ensure that temporary delays in payments to suppliers and contractors would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
not arise due to delays which could occur in GOI fund transfer to GOAP or to delay in GOAP&#13;
transfer of funds to ICADD. At Negotiations, assurances were obtained that GOAP would: (i)&#13;
establish a project escrow account for 50 percent of the payments received on account of retroactive&#13;
financing of eligible expenditures incurred prior to the date of the Development Credit and Loan&#13;
Agreements; and (ii) ensure that such such amounts are used as counterpart funds for financing&#13;
project activities prior to the Closing Date of the project.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
3.18   The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 108.10 million (US$150.0 million equivalent) and IBRD&#13;
Loan of US$175.0 million would finance about 77 percent of the total project costs net of taxes and&#13;
duties. The proceeds of the Loan/Credit (Annex 7) would be disbursed against:&#13;
(a) 76% of expenditures on civil works;&#13;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures or 100% of local ex-factory cost or 80% of other local costs of&#13;
goods, equipment, furniture and vehicles;&#13;
(c) 95% of expenditures on national consultancy services, studies, training, and 100% of foreign&#13;
consultant services;&#13;
(d) 95 % of expenditures on afforestation and canal plantation; and&#13;
(e) on a declining basis for recurrent expenditures on canal O&amp;M during construction, vehicle&#13;
hire charges, PPMU and R&amp;R administration and incremental staff--90% during FY96 and&#13;
FY97; 80% during FY98 and FY99; 55% during FY2000 and FY2001; and 25% thereafter.&#13;
3.19   Disbursements against civil works and forestry plantation contracts exceeding US$300,000&#13;
equivalent, vehicle and equipment contracts exceeding US$200,000 equivalent, and consultancy and&#13;
training contracts exceeding US$ 100,000, would be fully documented (for individual consultants, the&#13;
limit would be US$50,000 equivalent). For all other expenditures, disbursement could be against&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documents for SOEs would not be submitted to the&#13;
Bank/IDA, but would be retained by GOAP and made available to Bank staff during supervision.&#13;
Disbursements would exclude expenditures on land acquisition, survey and investigation and&#13;
engineering and administration for the irrigation sub-projects, R&amp;R and operation costs of the&#13;
environmental management plans, which would be funded by GOAP. The estimated Schedule of&#13;
Disbursements is presented in Annex 7.&#13;
3.20   Special Account. To facilitate project implementation and to reduce the risk of shortage of&#13;
GOAP's counterpart funding as well as to reduce the volume of withdrawal of application, a Special&#13;
Account in US dollars would be established in the Reserve Bank of India with an authorized&#13;
allocation of up to US$15 million equivalent, equal to the anticipated average four monthly&#13;
disbursement. This deposit is based on estimates of the project's financing needs and projected&#13;
Bank/IDA disbursements (Annex 7). The special account that would be maintained by the&#13;
Department of Economic Affairs would show all withdrawal requests disbursed, amounts advanced&#13;
and reimbursed by the Bank/IDA, and the balance at the end of each accounting period. Auditor's&#13;
reports would reflect the certification of the balance held by the Reserve Bank of India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
3.21   Disbursement Procedure. In line with the agreements of the Fourth Country Portfolio&#13;
Performance Review, GOI would ensure that, at the beginning of each fiscal year, an amount equal to&#13;
25% of project's expenditure budget--as determined by the project Annual Action Plan and Budget&#13;
(para. 4.38)--would be made available to GOAP as Advance Central Assistance for transfer to the&#13;
project implementing agency. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that GOI and GOAP would&#13;
implement a system satisfactory to the Bank/IDA for channeling the funds required for the project to&#13;
the project entities. An understanding was reached at Negotiations that GOI would release 25% of&#13;
anticipated project expenditures in advance to GOAP in accordance with the amounts established in the&#13;
project's Annual Action Plans and that, upon receipt of funds from GOI, GOAP would transfer such&#13;
funds, together with its quarterly counterpart contributions, immediately to the project accounts of&#13;
ICADD. In addition, an understanding was recorded at Negotiations that on April I of each year,&#13;
commencing on April 1, 1998 and thereafter by April I of each year, GOAP would inform the&#13;
Bank/IDA of the annual budgetary allocations made for meeting the financial needs of project&#13;
implementation during the forthcoming fiscal year.&#13;
Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.22   Project Budget Unit. A Program Budget and Accounts (PB&amp;A) sub-unit in the PPMU&#13;
would establish, maintain, and administer the financial management systems including program,&#13;
budget and cost allocation/accounting systems. This unit will be supported with adequate and&#13;
qualified staff on a full time basis. The system would be used to develop annual budgets by&#13;
consolidating budget requests from all ICADD organizational units and to ensure that the final&#13;
budget request is consistent with the policies and instructions from GOAP. Each management or&#13;
operational unit would be responsible for providing PB&amp;A with required information and estimates.&#13;
PB&amp;A would use this data to produce management reports that would track program progress. An&#13;
assurance was obtained at negotiations that a fully staffed Program Budget and Accounts sub-unit&#13;
headed by a qualified accountant would be established in the Project Preparation and Monitoring&#13;
Unit by October 1, 1997.&#13;
3.23   Project Accounts. A separate project account maintained by the PPMU in ICADD which,&#13;
with supporting documentation, would identify all project transactions on an ongoing basis including&#13;
contributions from GOAP, GOI and the loan/credit and provide a comprehensive record of project&#13;
financing and expenditures. The majority of project expenditure will be incurred at the main&#13;
component SRBC and SRSP sub-project sites. Payments will be made by Pay and Account Officers&#13;
who will compile and submit monthly accounts to Directors of Accounts stationed at SRBC and&#13;
SRSP. The monthly accounts will be consolidated by the PPMU in accordance with the accounting&#13;
standards of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, which are acceptable to the Bank. The&#13;
consolidated audited project accounts, including the special account and SOEs, and the auditor's&#13;
reports, which would include a separate statement on the SOEs and their certified copies, would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank/IDA annually no later than six months after the close of the fiscal year. The&#13;
audit report on SOEs would specifically comment on their usage and the controls established to&#13;
ensure their accuracy. Previous Bank-supported irrigation projects implemented by the ICADD&#13;
maintained satisfactory accounting systems and records and also complied with their audit&#13;
covenants.&#13;
3.24   The project accounts would show: (a) details of expenditures by investment items together&#13;
with their funding sources; and (b) expenditures at (a) classified by project components. The general&#13;
format of such accounts are exhibited in Annex 7. Project accounts would summarize expenditures&#13;
showing: (i) actual versus planned expenditures for each quarter and accumulated to date; and (ii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
financing source for the quarter, and accumulated.  The summaries, which would provide&#13;
information for the SOEs would form part of the project account, including those expenditures for&#13;
which reimbursement is claimed with full documentation. The project accounts would be supported&#13;
by a listing with the withdrawal applications submitted for the period. Assurances were obtained&#13;
from GOI and GOAP at negotiations that: (i) project accounts, including the Special Account and&#13;
Escrow Account, would be maintained and audited annually in accordance with sound auditing&#13;
standards consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank/IDA;&#13;
and (ii) certified copies of the annual financial statements and SOEs together with the auditors&#13;
report, which would comment separately on the SOEs, would be submitted to the Bank/IDA not later&#13;
than six months after the close of each GOAP fiscal year (April I to March 31).&#13;
IV. ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Organizational Reforms&#13;
Participatory Irrigation Management&#13;
4.01   State PIM Policy. A GOAP Government Order (G.O.) issued on July 19, 1995 adopted a&#13;
policy to promote participatory irrigation management (PIM) whereby the management of irrigation&#13;
networks below the minor canal level would be handed over to WUAs. A subsequent G.O. for a&#13;
statewide framework for WUA formation and implementation based on the SRSP pilot experience&#13;
was issued in February 1997. Expansion of the pilot program to cover the whole of the SRSP and&#13;
SRBC areas under the project is intended to serve as a prototype for the other public irrigation&#13;
schemes in the state. The objectives of the PIM Policy are to improve agricultural productivity by:&#13;
(a) improving water deliveries through more effective O&amp;M and thus improve distribution equity&#13;
and reliability; (b) ensuring physical sustainability through a division of labor whereby ICADD&#13;
would focus its resources on maintenance of the headworks, main canals and reliable agreed water&#13;
supplies to WUAs; and (c) promoting partnership, communication and cooperation between ICADD&#13;
and farmers.&#13;
4.02   The salient features of GOAP's PIM policy are: (a) farmers in the command area of major,&#13;
medium and minor irrigation projects will be encouraged to form WUAs to operate and manage&#13;
irrigation systems in their respective areas; (b) a WUA would manage a hydraulically contiguous&#13;
unit composed of a minor canal (or part of a distributary) serving 400-750 ha within the area of one&#13;
"Revenue Village" under a Memorandum of Understanding between its members and ICADD; (c)&#13;
the WUAs would be legally registered and democratically autonomous bodies subject to professional&#13;
audit and function according to principles determined by bye-laws to be framed under the IU &amp; CAD&#13;
Act; (d) the WUA will have the powers to regulate distribution of water within its jurisdiction on a&#13;
volumetric or any other basis and levy and collect penalties fixed by it for violation of water its&#13;
internal distribution arrangements; (e) WUAs may sell water saved through improved irrigation&#13;
available to their members; (f) the IU &amp; CAD Act would be amended to recognize WUAs, provide&#13;
incentives for their promotion including powers to initiate action against irrigators interfering with&#13;
water distribution; and (g) ICADD will promote maximization of WUA responsibilities by (i)&#13;
providing a reliable water supply at the minor canal head, (ii) undertaking rehabilitation of irrigation&#13;
networks wherever WUAs are formed, and (iii) facilitate fixation and collection of water user&#13;
charges by WUAs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
Reorganization of Command Area Development&#13;
4.03   State Command Area Development Council. GOAP issued a G.O. on June 13, 1996&#13;
implementing GOI recommendations for state CAD Councils and CADAs. The reconstituted State&#13;
CAD Council will be responsible for taking policy decisions on developmental activities in all the&#13;
public gravity irrigation commands in the state. The new State CAD Council will contain non-&#13;
governmental members representative of the state's command areas. Such members include&#13;
Members of Parliament (MPs) , Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), farmer's&#13;
representatives from WUAs and NGOs. The Council will meet at least twice a year and its decisions&#13;
are to be implemented without further examination by a concerned department.&#13;
4.04   Command Area Development Boards.  The reconstituted CADA Boards in AP will&#13;
approve programs, review CAD activities, and take implementation decisions subject to the&#13;
guidelines issued by the State CAD Council. New functions of the CAD Boards include: (a) acting&#13;
as a catalyst for formation of Farmer's Associations, WUAs and Distributary Committees; (b)&#13;
technical assistance to farmer organizations and WUAs, monitoring of their activities and advice in&#13;
selection and introduction of suitable cropping patterns; (c) assistance in developing groundwater to&#13;
supplement surface irrigation; and (d) assistance in development of post-harvest services and&#13;
organization of fairs, workshops, etc. to motivate farmers. Up to 60% of a reconstituted CAD Board&#13;
will be non-official members such as MPs and MLAs, heads of local government institutions, NGO&#13;
representatives, and Distributary Committee representatives from all reaches of a canal network.&#13;
Each CAD Board will be chaired by the Minister-in-Charge CAD Program and official members will&#13;
include concerned government Departments officials, District Revenue Collectors and the CADA's&#13;
Administrator-cum-Chief Engineer. GOAP and GOI program funds for WUA and CAD activities&#13;
will be released directly to CAD Boards so that they may function independently.&#13;
4.05   GOAP will constitute an Executive Committee for each CAD Board headed by the CADA&#13;
Administrator-cum-Chief Engineer. The CADA Executive Committee will be responsible for the&#13;
detailed working of each command's programs, take important administrative decisions and decide&#13;
matters according to the general directions of the CADA Board. The Executive Committee's&#13;
membership will have a 5 year tenure and include: (a) district officials from various involved GOAP&#13;
departments; and (b) the presidents of WUAs and/or Farmer's Associations at canal minor and&#13;
distributary level at the rate of two from the head, middle and tail reaches of the system. All&#13;
Department Heads of the various GOAP departments working in the command will be responsible to&#13;
the CADA Administrator in all matters related to the CAD activities and transfers of officers of the&#13;
Departments concerned are only to be made with the prior concurrence of the Administrator.&#13;
4.06   SRSP CADA Restructuring. The SRSP CADA would be restructured and serve as a pilot&#13;
for evaluation of GOAP's CADA reorganization program. The following modifications would be&#13;
implemented to improve the performance of the SRSP CADA:&#13;
*  The ICADD Chief Engineer (SRSP) would only be responsible only for construction activities&#13;
while all O&amp;M activity would be the responsibility of the SRSP CADA Administrator. The&#13;
functions of O&amp;M and CAD are to be integrated at the Division level to facilitate an assured&#13;
water delivery to WUAs.&#13;
* The CADA would be organized into two command area O&amp;M Divisions (one for the above&#13;
LMD command and one for the area below LMD) and a separate Division for the Sriramasagar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
Dam and headworks (Annex 8). The Administrator would be assisted by a Deputy Chief&#13;
Engineer and three Superintending Engineers each responsible for a Division. Groundwater and&#13;
Agricultural extension staff working in the command would report to him on their CAD-related&#13;
activities. Assistant Agriculture Officers would have an agricultural engineering background for&#13;
the tasks of implementing the canal Rotational Water Supply regime and technical assistance to&#13;
WUAs.&#13;
*  Gate operators ("Laskars") at the lowest level in the CADA organization are proposed to be&#13;
brought under the administrative control of WUAs in order to assist them in day-to-day water&#13;
management.&#13;
*  WUAs will be encouraged to take over the management of water distribution and canal&#13;
maintenance below minors and for this purpose, the entire SRSP command will be reorganized&#13;
into WUAs. Thus, with ultimate turnover of the tertiary network to WUAs, CADA water&#13;
management responsibilities would cease at the offtakes to WUA jurisdictions.&#13;
* SRSP CADA Administrators would be appointed with a minimum tenure of two years. The first&#13;
such appointment was made prior to project negotiations.&#13;
4.07   The organograms of the restructured CADA are given in Annex 8. When SRBC nears&#13;
completion, a SRBC CADA will be organized along similar lines to that of SRSP and incorporating&#13;
the experience gained in SRSP. Assurances were obtained from GOAP at Negotiations that by&#13;
October 1, 1997: (i) arrangements for a reconstituted SRSP CADA Board would be in place; and (ii)&#13;
proposed SRSP CADA restructuring appointments, including that of Assistant Agricultural Officers&#13;
with agricultural engineering training, will have been completed..&#13;
4.08   SRSP CADA O&amp;M  Framework. The SRSP CADA restructuring is predicated on a&#13;
transfer of works from the construction wing of ICADD to the SRSP CADA organization as laid&#13;
down in a July 28, 1995 Government Order [G.O.Ms. 1 171&amp;CAD(PW-SRSP.II(2))]. A detailed&#13;
procedure for the transfer has been developed and is given in the SRSP Plan of Operations &amp;&#13;
Maintenance (POM) document which includes O&amp;M functions and several other technical and&#13;
administrative responsibilities. The POM also sets forth a framework for: (a) the O&amp;M and&#13;
management duties of all O&amp;M staff; and (b) the maintenance planning and budget estimation&#13;
procedures. The reorganization and transfer process is expected to take about two years (inclusive of&#13;
staff training and system operation hand-over). During the project, joint O&amp;M management of the&#13;
tertiary networks are expected to result in gradual hand-over of minor canal maintenance to&#13;
established WUAs. The experience gained with the restructured CADA O&amp;M framework would be&#13;
applied for SRBC also.&#13;
Cost Recovery Arrangements&#13;
4.09   Irrigation Water Charge Increase (Annex 11, para. 11). During project preparation, the&#13;
Bank had expressed increasing concern about public irrigation investment sustainability caused by&#13;
the low allocation of funding for O&amp;M works and the low level of irrigation water charges&#13;
(para.5.19). As part of a fiscal reform program, GOAP has gazetted an Ordinance on January 3,&#13;
1997 raising irrigation water charges to: (a) Rs.200 per acre for monsoon wet crops, and Rs.150 per&#13;
acre for dry season wet crops; and (b) a uniform rate of Rs. 100 per acre for dry crops irrespective the&#13;
season of their cultivation. This ordinance has subsequently been confirmed by the AP State&#13;
Assembly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
4.10   Revenue Sharing. In view of the large rate increase and as an incentive to WUAs, GOAP&#13;
has proposed that, in the case of major and medium schemes, only 50% of the collected irrigation&#13;
revenue from the enhanced water charge would be retained by the government: 40% would be given&#13;
to WUAs for O&amp;M works and 10% to Gram Panchayats (local government councils). In the case of&#13;
minor irrigation schemes, 100% of the collected revenue would be given to WUAs.&#13;
4.11   Water Charges Review Committee. To ensure the efficacy of GOAP's increased irrigation&#13;
water charges, revenue sharing and RWS policies in for upland schemes, water charge assessment&#13;
procedures and revenue collection performance need to be regularly monitored and reviewed.&#13;
GOAP is in the process of establishing a standing state-level Water Charges Review Committee&#13;
(WCRC) with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank/IDA. The WCRC would also review data&#13;
on actual O&amp;M budget allocation needs for those portions of schemes under ICADD control, water&#13;
charge levels and their affordability, and the impact of WUA promotion on revenue-sharing&#13;
formulae. The WCRC would consist, inter alia, of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Finance, Irrigation&#13;
and Revenue of GOAP and meet annually for consideration of adjustments to O&amp;M budget&#13;
allocations, water charge assessment and collection policies and procedures. In preparation for such&#13;
meetings, GOAP would engage consultants to collect and compile data on water charge assessment,&#13;
revenue-sharing and collection performance, and trends in O&amp;M costs. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that GOAP would: (i) constitute a Water Charges Review Committee (WCRC) with&#13;
composition and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank/IDA by October 1, 1997; and (ii) engage&#13;
consultants to prepare a report on water charge assessment, collection and revenue sharing for&#13;
consideration by the WCRC and for submission to the Bank/IDA for information not later than&#13;
December 31, 1998.&#13;
B. Project Management&#13;
Management Organization&#13;
4.12   Project Empowered Committee. For overall project oversight, control and coordination,&#13;
GOAP issued a G.O. on June 26, 1996 establishing an Empowered Committee chaired by the GOAP&#13;
Chief Secretary with Principal Secretary (Finance), Secretary (Law), Principal Secretary (ICADD),&#13;
and ICADD Secretary (Projects) as members. The Empowered Committee's functions are: (a)&#13;
ensuring timely release of funds to ICADD for the project; (b) dealing with senior personnel&#13;
management appointment matters; (c) monitoring of overall project progress; (d) ensuring&#13;
coordination and implementation performance of all government agencies and entities involved in&#13;
the project, and in particular, those involved in the EMP component; and (e) resolving procurement&#13;
issues and meeting of project procurement arrangements. The Empowered Committee would meet&#13;
twice a year following the issue of semi-annual project status reports (para.4.41) and may also be&#13;
convened by the Secretary (Projects) to deal with project management contingencies.&#13;
4.13   Overall Management. The project will be implemented by ICADD under the Principal&#13;
Secretary (ICADD). Direct project management responsibility will be vested in the Secretary&#13;
(Projects) who will supervise: (a) the Chief Engineers of SRBC and SRSP responsible for ICADD&#13;
line staff units engaged in design and construction supervision under the irrigation and dam safety&#13;
components; (b) the Special Officer with Chief Engineer rank in charge of the Project Preparation&#13;
and Management Unit (PPMU) responsible for procurement coordination, budgeting, reimbursement&#13;
and accounting, reporting, monitoring and evaluation, supervision of R&amp;R implementation and&#13;
general coordination and supervision of training programs, research and agricultural extension; (c)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
the work of the Forest Development Corporation undertaking the afforestation under the EMP&#13;
component and coordination of other participating agencies involved in the EMP; and (d) the SRSP&#13;
O&amp;M works and WUA establishment undertaken by the SRSP CADA Administrator-cum-Chief&#13;
Engineer working under the direction of the ICADD's CAD Commissioner. Feeder road works will&#13;
be executed by the Roads &amp; Buildings Department (RBD).&#13;
4.14   Project Preparation and Management Unit. The existing PPMU line responsibilities will&#13;
be reorganized by: (a) designating one EE as a deputy chief engineer responsible for a cell&#13;
monitoring all procurement, civil works and administration; and (b) designating an EE as deputy&#13;
chief engineer responsible for a cell monitoring all R&amp;R, environmental and groundwater utilization&#13;
activities. An Accounts Officer will be responsible for an accounting and reimbursement cell and&#13;
Project Accounts (para. 3.23), while a Deputy Director of agriculture will monitor the Agricultural&#13;
Support Services component's research, extension and training activities. An WUA Advisor for the&#13;
PIM program (para. 2.36) will be assigned to the PPMU. An organogram of the PPMU is given in&#13;
Annex 8.&#13;
Works Quality Assurance and Supervision&#13;
4.15   Staffing. The management of the irrigation construction wings of SRBC and SRSP will&#13;
each be headed by a Chief Engineer (Annex 8). For SRSP, 137 additional supervision engineers will&#13;
have to be appointed. Quality assurance in each of these projects is currently undertaken by a sub-&#13;
project Quality Control Division (QCD) headed by an independent Supervisory Engineer under each&#13;
Chief Engineer. Given the large increase in construction activity, the number of quality control&#13;
divisions will be increased in both sub-projects. In SRSP alone, the number of QCD engineers&#13;
would be increased from 43 to 120 (Annex 8). The Action Plan for Quality Control Organization&#13;
prepared by ICADD defines the duties and responsibilities of all staff levels of the QCDs on-site and&#13;
in the field laboratories. It also defines the nature of coordination between the QCD and site&#13;
construction supervision staff and their duties with respect to reporting to the QCD. The Action Plan&#13;
empowers an EE of a QCD to order stoppage of work if serious construction flaws are identified&#13;
although arranging for their remediation remains the responsibility of the construction wing EE. An&#13;
assurance was obtained from GOAP at negotiations that, by October 1, 1997, additional staff would&#13;
be posted to SRBC and SRSP Construction Circles and Quality Control Divisions as per the staffing&#13;
schedule submitted by GOAP to the Bank/IDA on December 20, 1996.&#13;
4.16   Supervision Procedures. In addition to the extant AP II Quality Control Manual, Quality&#13;
Audit Guidelines and an 'OK Card' system for irrigation works have been successfully introduced&#13;
during project preparation as found during the construction quality audit of on-going works (para.&#13;
2.28). These procedures will be maintained during the project and serve to reduce spurious financial&#13;
claims while recording proper supervision procedure. For road quality assurance, RBD will second&#13;
experienced staff to the ICADD QCU divisions in the areas that road works are being constructed.&#13;
Dam Safety Assurance&#13;
4.17   ICADD's Dam Safety Cell (DSC) operates under the control of the Chief Engineer (Central&#13;
Designs Organization). Its functions consist of post-construction monitoring, data compilation and&#13;
collection, review of dam safety inspection reports of ICADD dams. GOAP has decided to&#13;
strengthen the DSC to cater for all aspects of dam safety in the state and ICADD has prepared a Dam&#13;
Safety Assurance and Rehabilitation Identification Report outlining the proposed program to monitor&#13;
the safety of the state's 180 large dams and tanks. Reorganization of dam safety activity will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
based on appointment of a State Level Dam Safety Committee chaired by the ICADD Engineer-in-&#13;
Chief. The Committee would meet at least twice a year to: (a) review the activities and reports of the&#13;
DSC; (b) establish priorities for works needing remedial safety works; (c) assign responsibilities for&#13;
execution of non-departmental works and determine the need for independent experts. The DSC's&#13;
expanded duties will include preparation of a Dam Safety Manual for each major dam beginning&#13;
with Sriramasagar, Srisailam and Lower Mannair dams. An independent project Dam Safety Review&#13;
Panel (DSRP)--originally constituted under AP II--will continue to review and guide implementation&#13;
of the project's dam safety component including construction of major structures in SRBC. The staff&#13;
assigned to dam safety works in SRBC will be increased to supervise Srisailam spillway repairs.&#13;
Krishna River Basin Reservoir Management&#13;
4.18   GOAP issued a Government Order on June 15, 1996 which institutionalizes operating rules&#13;
based on fixed delivery priorities according to available storage. A subsequent G.O. was issued on&#13;
August 1, 1996 to reconstitute the Inter-Agency Committee for Integrated Operation of the Srisailan&#13;
and Nagarjunasagar Reservoirs established in 1989 into a standing "Committee for Integrated&#13;
Operation of Krishna and Pennar Basin Schemes" (CIOKRIP) which is to meet seasonally to consider&#13;
water releases for multi-purpose uses for all schemes dependent on the Krishna River. Under these&#13;
G.O.s: (a) GOAP scheme water allocation priorities are preserved and non-firm hydroelectric power&#13;
generation at Srisailam is kept subservient to SRBC irrigation requirements; (b), specific uniform multi-&#13;
purpose operating tables are to be derived for Srisailam Reservoir's power and irrigation operation&#13;
staff; (c) CIOKRIP would plan meeting seasonal water requirements in the AP portion of the river&#13;
basin, review the efficacy of monthly allocations and multi-reservoir storage regulation; and (d)&#13;
monitor day to day release requirements during drought periods.&#13;
Resettlement and Rehabilitation&#13;
4.19   The Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans (ERAPs) for SRBC and SRSP (para. 2.45)&#13;
envisage a four tier R&amp;R implementation and monitoring organization. This consists of the a State&#13;
R&amp;R Committee, the R&amp;R Cell of the PPMU, District R&amp;R Committees, sub-project Rehabilitation&#13;
Units under a Special Collector and Village R&amp;R Committees assisted by NGOs. An organogram&#13;
showing the overall management and implementation organization with the members of each&#13;
management unit is given in Annex 8.&#13;
4.20   State R&amp;R Committee and PPMU R&amp;R Cell. A multi-agency State R&amp;R Committee has&#13;
been established under the chairmanship of the Principal Secretary (ICADD) to guide the R&amp;R&#13;
activities under the project. Meetings of this committee would be convened by the Secretary&#13;
(Projects). The State R&amp;R Committee will review overall R&amp;R progress, make R&amp;R policy&#13;
decisions, and coordinate among concerned departments. The PPMU will have a R&amp;R Cell headed&#13;
by an EE of Deputy Chief Engineer rank to monitor day-to-day R&amp;R performance and report to the&#13;
State R&amp;R Committee. The PPMU R&amp;R Cell would be responsible for R&amp;R implementation in&#13;
ICADD and its functions include planning, supervision, monitoring and coordination of all R&amp;R&#13;
activities. It would also be responsible for contracting NGOs according to the criteria in Annex 13 to&#13;
implement the assist in facilitating community income-generating activities.&#13;
4.21   District Level Organization.  The District R&amp;R Committee--chaired by the District&#13;
Collector and consisting of NGO representatives and officials from government agencies--is the&#13;
R&amp;R coordinating and implementing agency at the district level. Full-time Special Collectors have&#13;
been appointed to SRSP and SRBC to implement land acquisition and rehabilitation program of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
sub-project ERAPs. The Special Collectors would convene meetings of their respective District&#13;
Committee. The Special Collectors' office would be composed of a Land Acquisition Unit and a&#13;
Rehabilitation Unit, headed respectively by a Revenue Department Land Acquisition Officer and a&#13;
Rehabilitation Officer from the cadre of Joint Registrar of Cooperative Societies who would&#13;
coordinate implementation with the various line departments.&#13;
4.22   Each Rehabilitation Unit would be staffed with the following additional officers: (a)&#13;
Assistant Rehabilitation Officer (Women &amp; Child Welfare) responsible for liaison with the District&#13;
Rural Development Agency and Child Welfare Department to promote formation of women's thrift&#13;
groups, income generating schemes for women, and child and maternity care; (b) Project Economist&#13;
responsible for formulating Village Rehabilitation Plans (para. 2.46) and monitoring their&#13;
implementation, and for progress reporting to project authorities; (c) Computer Programmer&#13;
responsible for creating a data base for land acquisition and R&amp;R works, maintenance of accounts&#13;
and computerization of all routine data and functions; and (d) Executive Engineer (Infrastructure) in&#13;
charge R&amp;R civil works. An assurance was obtained at negotiations from GOAP that all&#13;
government staff positions required for the R&amp;R implementation organization would be filled by&#13;
October 1, 1997.&#13;
4.23   Village Rehabilitation Committees. R&amp;R Officers and NGOs will assist PAPs living in the&#13;
affected villages to form Village Rehabilitation Committees (VRC). The VRC will include women&#13;
and members from each recognized community group and caste. Working closely with NGOs and&#13;
R&amp;R officers, the VRCs would participate in formulating Village Rehabilitation Action Plans&#13;
(VAP), PAP consultation, implementation of the VAPs and monitoring of R&amp;R progress.&#13;
4.24   Non-Governmental Organizations.  NGOs experienced in rural development and&#13;
community mobilization would be engaged for R&amp;R implementation. NGOs would be engaged by&#13;
the PPMU and work under the supervision of the Special Collectors and Rehabilitation Officers to&#13;
implement the ERAPs in cooperation with R&amp;R officers in the district Rehabilitation Unit and other&#13;
line departments. NGOs would: (a) participate in all R&amp;R committee meetings at different levels;&#13;
(b) organize VRCs and consultation of PAPs; (c) prepare VAPs with VRCs and R&amp;R officers; (d)&#13;
assist Special Collectors in land acquisition, assessment of land value and payment of compensation;&#13;
(e) coordinate PAP-specific income generating schemes with VRCs and organize women's thrift&#13;
groups; (f) facilitate vocational training programs; and (g) monitoring income generating activities.&#13;
Terms of Reference are given in Annex 5 for NGOs involved in the R&amp;R program.&#13;
4.25   Settlement of PAP Grievances. The VRCs and NGOs will be mainly responsible for&#13;
collecting complaints and grievances from PAPs regarding land valuation, entitlements, entitlement&#13;
delivery and R&amp;R activities etc. These grievances will be brought to R&amp;R officers for attention. The&#13;
District R&amp;R Committee (para. 4.23) is the second level of grievance redress mechanism. If any&#13;
grievances cannot be redressed, they would be brought to the PPMU R&amp;R Cell and the State R&amp;R&#13;
Committee (Annex 5). Grievances, raised and disposed, will be recorded as part of the R&amp;R internal&#13;
monitoring system (para. 2.28).&#13;
4.26   R&amp;R Monitoring Arrangements.  Both internal and external monitoring would be&#13;
conducted concurrently to determine the implementation progress of the R&amp;R component throughout&#13;
the project period. The monitoring entities would report to the State R&amp;R Committee and the&#13;
PPMU's R&amp;R Cell, who would review and evaluate the R&amp;R progress and determine any necessary&#13;
measures to correct any identified problems. The PPMU will be responsible for the monitoring of&#13;
R&amp;R implementation through the District Committees, NGOs and VRCs. The NGOs and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
Rehabilitation Unit under the Special Collector will monitor R&amp;R progress and present quarterly&#13;
R&amp;R progress reports to the District R&amp;R Committees, who will, in turn, furnish the progress reports&#13;
to the PPMU. The PPMU R&amp;R Cell would set up a computerized monitoring system and develop&#13;
monitoring forms.&#13;
4.27   Independent monitoring of R&amp;R progress would be carried out by a qualified NGO engaged&#13;
for monitoring and evaluation of all R&amp;R activities according to an agreed terms of reference&#13;
(Annex 5). The NGO multi-disciplinary team will be community-based and will have field offices.&#13;
The monitoring NGO would submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Special Collectors. At the&#13;
end of each year, the monitoring NGO would submit annual monitoring and evaluation reports with&#13;
suggestions for modifications and improvements for the coming year. The independent monitoring&#13;
report would be submitted to the Bank. An assurance was obtained from GOAP at negotiations that&#13;
it would recruit a suitably qualified NGO R&amp;R monitoring consultant satisfactory to the Bank/IDA&#13;
by March 1, 1998 and that its annual monitoring reports would be submitted to the Bank/IDA.&#13;
Irrigation Agronomy and Farmer Training Program&#13;
4.28   Agricultural Research.  The research sub-component would be carried out under the&#13;
supervision of an agronomist from the AP Agricultural University (APAU) and officers from various&#13;
participating government departments redeployed for its execution. The work would be monitored&#13;
by WALAMTARI and the scientists of the three Regional Agricultural Research Stations (RARS) in&#13;
the SRSP project area and the RARS Nandyal in SRBC. An inter-disciplinary Coordination&#13;
Committee would be established for both SRSP and SRBC to ensure inter-departmental coordination&#13;
and its membership would include a progressive farmer from each research site. A State Level&#13;
Steering Committee will review and monitor the on-farm operational research programs through&#13;
regular contact with each Coordination Committee. The Steering Committee would contain senior&#13;
officials from ICADD, APAU, WALAMTARI, the Agriculture and Horticulture Departments and&#13;
farmers' representatives.&#13;
4.29   Agricultural Extension. While there are an adequate number of Village Extension Officers&#13;
(VEOs) in SRBC and in SRSP above LMD for the proposed extension program, the number of VEOs&#13;
in the Warangal district below LMD needs to be increased. Based on past experience, it is proposed&#13;
that the shortage of 35 VEOs could be filled by temporary recruitment (for 5 years) of 35 agricultural&#13;
graduates as agricultural development apprentices (ADAs) under the supervision of 5 Agricultural&#13;
Officers (AOs). The AOs would be incremental staff that need to be appointed. An assurance was&#13;
obtained at Negotiations that sufficient numbers of agricultural graduate VEOs and Agricultural&#13;
Officers would be posted by October 1, 1997&#13;
4.30   The various extension programs set up in a phased manner would be monitored in SRSP and&#13;
SRBC by Extension Program Steering Committees who would guide the personnel involved in&#13;
extension and training. The performance of ADAs, AOs and VEOs would be evaluated by these&#13;
committees. The membership of each Extension Program Steering Committee would be chaired by&#13;
the Associate Director of Research of an RARS and include: (a) Joint Director of Agriculture (b)&#13;
SRSP CADA Administrator/Superintendent Engineer SRBC; and (c) WUA representatives.&#13;
4.31   WALAMTARI Training Programs. The existing WALAMTARI training organization&#13;
established for AP II would be expanded under the leadership of the WALAMTARI Director-&#13;
General (Annex 8). A Director (Training &amp; WUAs) would be responsible for the conduct of project&#13;
training courses at WALAMTARI headquarters for the officers of ICADD and the Agriculture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Department. He would be assisted by one EE and one Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) for&#13;
carrying out the training programs, and by a Institutional Specialist (rural sociologist of Associate&#13;
Professor rank) for promotion of WUAs (Annex 8). The Director (Field Training) would be&#13;
responsible for the conduct of training at the eight field training centers. He would be assisted one&#13;
DDA at headquarters and by an EE placed in each of the two project commands (at LMD in SRSP&#13;
and Nandyal in SRBC) to guide training and coordinate the activities at various field training centers.&#13;
The DDA would guide and assist agricultural training and oversee the maintenance of demonstration&#13;
farms at field training centers. Both Directors should be of SE/JDA rank. An assurance was&#13;
obtained from GOAP that the Director of WALAMTARI field training programs would be posted by&#13;
October 1, 1997.&#13;
Environmental Management Plan Responsibilities&#13;
4.32   GOAP desires that a professional agency assume the responsibility of implementing the&#13;
EMP in a systematic manner. Thus GOAP has entrusted the Andhra Pradesh State Forest&#13;
Development Corporation (SFDC), a GOAP parastatal agency, with implementation of the&#13;
afforestation components. Monitoring of the EMP activities of the SFDC and all other participating&#13;
departments and agencies would be carried out by the Environmental cell of the PPMU (para. 4.14).&#13;
SFDC would directly implement compensatory afforestation, canal bank plantation, catchment area&#13;
treatment plans and soil conservation measures. The SFDC has the requisite infrastructure for&#13;
implementation of the activities entrusted to it, including soil conservation works. The agency&#13;
obtains its technical forestry staff on secondment from the State Forest Department who have the&#13;
requisite experience. The other agencies involved in the EMP are Agriculture, Environment &amp;&#13;
Forests, Groundwater, Fisheries and State Health Directorate. Sub-components relating to wildlife&#13;
preservation would be entrusted to the Wildlife Wing of the Forest Department. Site restoration and&#13;
muck stabilization would be the responsibility of ICADD through its supervision of construction&#13;
contracts. Although the head of each participating department is responsible for execution of his&#13;
agency's involvement in the EMP, each agency would designate a nodal officer for coordinating its&#13;
activities. Overall implementation will be monitored by the State Level and Project Environmental&#13;
Management Committees established by G.O. in February 1993.&#13;
C. Implementation Monitoring&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.33   Project monitoring and physical and financial planning are related to the GOAP fiscal year&#13;
(April I to March 31 of the following year). A Master Implementation Schedule for each project&#13;
sub-component within the SRBC and SRSP sub-project areas has been prepared by ICADD. The&#13;
Master Schedule notes all key procurement events and records the periods of canal closure in SRSP&#13;
during which work can take place. A summary implementation schedule is exhibited in Annex 12; a&#13;
detailed implementation schedule for the R&amp;R component is given in Annex 5.&#13;
4.34   The master schedules are based on the following principles: (a) all land acquisition for&#13;
SRBC works is to be completed prior to the estimated date of award of any new civil works contract;&#13;
(b) on-farm irrigation and drainage works in SRBC are scheduled to commence at least 9 months&#13;
before completion of the tertiary network of their respective irrigation blocks so that they could be&#13;
ready on time for initiation of irrigation (para. 2.15); (c) whereas six of the sixteen irrigation block&#13;
packages of SRBC would only be awarded in PY3, all network rehabilitation contracts for SRSP&#13;
would be awarded in PYI and PY2; and (d) scheduling of SRSP main canal and main distributary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
works is based on closure of Kakatiya Canal from March 15 to June 15 of each year while&#13;
rehabilitation of small distributaries and minors is to be undertaken sequentially from December 15&#13;
to June 15 by missing a Rabi irrigation season as necessary. The need for seasonal canal closure in&#13;
SRSP has been conveyed to irrigators during public consultations and included in bid documents.&#13;
Project Performance Monitoring Framework&#13;
4.35   Project Performance Indicators The PPMU would be responsible for assembling and&#13;
reporting all project performance indicators from field units and participating agencies according to&#13;
an agreed framework. The physical and financial progress data for each construction contract and&#13;
irrigation performance would be obtained from the Management Information System database to be&#13;
established in the office of the SRBC and SRSP Chief Engineers respectively. A framework of key&#13;
Performance Monitoring Indicators relating to achievement of project objectives, outputs and&#13;
component input implementation progress has been prepared and is shown in Annex 12. The&#13;
PPMU's would arrange for a Baseline Sun=e (Terms of Reference in Annex 12) to record present&#13;
socio-economic and production conditions in the sub-project areas for the purposes of comparison&#13;
with a similar survey to be conducted prior to project closure. The survey--to be completed by the&#13;
end of the first project year--would cover agricultural data (average cropping patterns, yields, input&#13;
use etc.), household income and socio-economic data, current sources of irrigation and areas&#13;
irrigated. At negotiations, the Baseline Survey terms of reference and Performance Monitoring&#13;
Indicators were confirmed by GOAP and an understanding was recorded that GOAP would establish&#13;
a data collection system to facilitate regular reporting of the project output and implementation&#13;
progress indicators in project status reports. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
Baseline Survey would be completed not later than December 31, 1998.&#13;
4.36   Water Charge Collection Monitoring. The assessment and collection of water charges is&#13;
the responsibility of the Revenue Department (RD). Water charge assessment requires accurate&#13;
verification of areas actually irrigated. Detailed records of water charge assessments are maintained&#13;
by the Village Revenue Office describing the performance of the irrigation system below the&#13;
irrigation outlet. A provisional assessment is made for every field receiving irrigation (source-wise)&#13;
during October/November of each year and is finalized in May/June of the following year. Revenue&#13;
Village assessments are then aggregated by revenue jurisdictions for the entire state. Assessment of&#13;
water charges and the exchange of information between the RD and ICADD needs to be improved.&#13;
The reason why every potentially irrigable field is not irrigated or receives inadequate service is&#13;
recorded and used to deal with applications for remission of the water charge. However, water&#13;
charge remission information is not communicated to ICADD nor is it consulted information&#13;
exchange between ICADD and RD is infrequent and limited. ICADD does not provide RD with&#13;
irrigation maps nor does RD inform ICADD about irrigated areas entered in village records: thus&#13;
information that could serve to improve system performance is not used. Exacerbated by lack of&#13;
field staff in RD, this lack of communication enables farmers to conceal irrigated areas, evade&#13;
payments and misuse water.&#13;
4.37   During its implementation, the proposed project would serve as a model for establishment of&#13;
a service quality and increased water charge linkage in SRSP and SRBC. To achieve this, it would&#13;
be necessary to maintain separate accounts for each sub-project reflecting both water charge amounts&#13;
collected by RD and O&amp;M expenditures by the ICADD and the WUAs. Unfortunately, water charge&#13;
collection accounts are not kept in a manner that allows full reconciliation over the entire command:&#13;
the units are village areas which almost always include non-irrigated areas and other irrigation&#13;
sources such as wells and village tanks. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that, for the SRSP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
sub-project, GOAP would: (i) arrange for separate village irrigation revenue records to be kept by the&#13;
Revenue Department for canal irrigated areas based on distribution network maps supplied by&#13;
ICADD; (ii) require ICADD to keep records of the volume and duration of water supply made&#13;
available to each tertiary area and WUA; (iii) require that ICADD canal flow records and Revenue&#13;
Village canal scheme irrigation records be systematically analyzed and reconciled each year for&#13;
monitoring of WUA efficacy in field water distribution, bulk water supply service, and water charge&#13;
assessment and collection efficiency; and (iv) cause ICADD to submit the above analysis results to&#13;
the Water Charges Review Committee and the Bank/IDA for information not later than December 31&#13;
of each year starting 1998.&#13;
Reporting and Project Review&#13;
4.38   Reporting. An action-oriented review, planning and budgeting reporting process would be a&#13;
key feature of project management and implementation monitoring. This would take the form of: (a)&#13;
a semi-annual Project Status Report (which would include, inter alia, data on construction progress,&#13;
quality assurance and contract management prepared by the Chief Engineers of SRBC and SRSP&#13;
respectively; and (b) a comprehensive Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget (ARAPB) Report&#13;
(para. 4.39). All reports would be compiled and prepared by the PPMU. The semi-annual Project&#13;
Status Reports would be produced in standard format and would track the implementation progress&#13;
of each project component, including physical and financial progress, procurement, disbursement&#13;
and key output and implementation performance indicators. The semi-annual status reports and&#13;
ARAPB report would be submitted to the Principal Secretary (ICADD) and Secretary (Projects), and&#13;
copied to the Empowered Committee, relevant GOAP officials, GOI and the Bank/IDA. The project&#13;
reporting arrangements were confirmed at negotiations. Assurances were obtained from GOAP at&#13;
negotiations that: (i) it would prepare and submit a draft Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget&#13;
Report for the forthcoming GOAP fiscal year to the Bank/IDA for review and comment by January&#13;
15 of each year, commencing January 15, 1998; and (ii) not later than April 15 of each year, the&#13;
agreed Action Plan would be implemented taking account of Bank/IDA comments in accordance&#13;
with the agreed budget.&#13;
4.39   Annual Project Implementation Review. Preparation of the ARAPB Report would be the&#13;
main vehicle for annual GOAP review of project performance and future needs, for adjusting&#13;
ICADD's program as needed, for budgeting by GOAP of ICADD's expenditures, for assessing&#13;
progress and determining follow-on actions regarding WUA formation policies, and for major&#13;
review and supervision by GOI and the Bank/IDA. For ICADD, it would provide annual opportunity&#13;
to assess the overall project program, to propose adjustments as needed and to present its&#13;
consolidated plan and justification for financing needs for the forthcoming year. The ARAPB Report&#13;
would review the past year's achievements for each component and responsible unit and/or agency in&#13;
terms of development indicators, physical targets and expenditure, and would propose a revised work&#13;
program and expenditure budget for the forthcoming fiscal year.&#13;
4.40   The ARAPB Report's content would include: (a) description of each year's works, schedule&#13;
of activities, staffing requirements and distribution of responsibilities; (b) proposed expenditures for&#13;
the next fiscal year compared with the past year's actual expenditures and the budgeted and expected&#13;
expenditures of the current year; (c) details on major civil works contracts exceeding US$300,000,&#13;
and equipment and vehicle contracts exceeding US $200,000; (d) review of implementation progress&#13;
related to the improved canal and water management program in SRSP (and for SRBC when&#13;
irrigation begins); (e) detailed review of project maintenance needs; (f) progress with the project&#13;
farmer participation and turnover program; and (g) progress with the various staff and farmer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
training programs. The ARAPB Report would quantify and compare progress with an updated&#13;
Master Implementation Schedule and the previous ARAPB, and would highlight key issues and&#13;
constraints. An overview with summarized data and a listing of decisions taken or recommended,&#13;
based on each unit's submission, would be prepared by the PPMU. This would include commentary&#13;
on the status of decisions and actions outstanding from the previous semi-annual status report, and&#13;
review of decisions/actions still required related to recommendations of the Project Empowered&#13;
Committee, GOI or Bank/IDA supervision missions.&#13;
4.41   Mid-Term Review. Prior to project mid-term, a Mid-Term Review Report would be&#13;
prepared by the PPMU according to a terms of reference to be agreed with a prior Bank/IDA&#13;
supervision mission. The mid-termn review report would include an assessment of: (a) procurement,&#13;
implementation and disbursement progress of each project component; (b) progress in participatory&#13;
irrigation management, water delivery improvement and collection of irrigation water charges in the&#13;
SRSP command; (c) reorganization and improvement of SRSP CADA performance; (d) the&#13;
likelihood of completion by project closure of all components in general and irrigation works in&#13;
particular; and (e) any project design changes or component restructuring needed to achieve project&#13;
objectives prior to closure. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOAP would: (i) submit a&#13;
detailed Mid-Term Review Report of the project to the Bank/IDA by October 31, 1999; and (ii) not&#13;
later than April 30, 2000, review with the Bank/IDA any possible need for adjustments to the design&#13;
of project components and its implementation arrangements and thereafter implement the mid-term&#13;
review's recommendations.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
4.42   Bank/IDA supervision would be initiated by a Propect Launch/First Supervision Mission&#13;
mounted as soon as possible after the project is declared effective. The mission would assist ICADD&#13;
in ensuring that: (a) procurement, accounting and disbursement arrangements meet Bank guidelines&#13;
and project covenants; (b) implementation and procurement schedules and benchmarks are updated;&#13;
(c) adequate arrangements are made to collect and process data for performance monitoring&#13;
indicators; (d) project reporting formats are satisfactory; (e) finalize terms of reference for technical&#13;
assistance and studies. The first mission will also review arrangements for: project staffing and&#13;
SRSP CADA reorganization, inter-agency coordination, contract management and quality assurance,&#13;
initiation of staff and farrner training programs, WUA formation and improved canal management in&#13;
SRSP. Subsequent Bank/IDA supervision missions would comprise a main annual supervision&#13;
mission at the time of ARAPB review (para. 4.39), supplemented by shorter field visit. A&#13;
Superviaion Plan is given in Annex 12. A separate mission would be mounted for Bank/IDA&#13;
participation in the mid-term review to be conducted by GOAP.&#13;
V. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
Productivity, Employment and Income (Annex 10)&#13;
5.01   Farm Production and Economic Benefits. Assistance to GOAP for rehabilitation and&#13;
completion of the SRSP 253,000 ha command area and completion of the 65,000 ha SRBC project&#13;
begun under the AP II project would add 153,000 ha to the surface irrigation commands in AP. The&#13;
agricultural objective of these works is to promote the production of high value cash crops in upland&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
irrigation schemes by improved water delivery, applied farming systems research, irrigation&#13;
agronomy extension and farmer training. These inputs would result in significant incremental&#13;
agricultural production consisting of cereals and pulses, oilseeds, cotton and other cash crops.&#13;
Project agricultural output would generate an annual Value Added to the local economy estimated at&#13;
Rs.5.03 billion (about US$140 million) in 1995 prices. These project outputs would be sustained by&#13;
investment to ensure the safety and economic life of the Srisailam and Sriramasagar dams which, in&#13;
turn, would ensure sustained irrigated and hydroelectric power production within the Krishna and&#13;
Godavari river basins outside the project areas. Completion of the command area feeder road&#13;
program would promote farm produce marketing and provide quantifiable economic benefits in&#13;
travel time and vehicle operating cost savings valued at about Rs.60 million per annum.&#13;
5.02   Afforestation  Products and  Environmental Conservation.   The Environmental&#13;
Management Plan component would also generate several benefits, including: (a) soil conservation and&#13;
reduced reservoir sedimentation due to catchment area treatnent and reservoir green belt plantation; (b)&#13;
generation of forest products by compensatory afforestation, canal bank and the green belt plantations;&#13;
and (c) water-borne disease control under the environmental health program. Natural resources and&#13;
wildlife conservation in protected areas would be improved, while conservation benefits are not readily&#13;
quantifiable, canal bank and reservoir green belt plantation would produce saleable fuelwood,&#13;
pulpwood, faggotwood in the future (para. 5.07).&#13;
5.03   Employment. The number of directly benefiting farm families is estimated at about&#13;
447,700 (about 2.24 million people). At full development, the increased demand for farm labor would&#13;
amount to about 31.6 million man-days per annum (equivalent to about 105,450 full-time jobs). About&#13;
one half of the manpower demand would be supplied by hired labor, the majority of which consists of&#13;
landless workers. The increased agricultural production would generate off-farm employment (over&#13;
26,000 transport, marketing and processing jobs) in project area Districts. Construction of civil&#13;
works would generate a temporary increase in employment opportunities.&#13;
5.04   Farm Income Enhancement. The project would result in a significant increase in farm&#13;
income for primarily marginal and small farmers owning less than 2 ha (the average farm holding is&#13;
1.8 ha and 1.1 ha in SRBC and SRSP, respectively), and comprise 70% to 80% of the total holdings&#13;
in the two sub-projects. The annual net income increments for average farms are estimated at 360%&#13;
in SRBC, 104% in SRSP's rehabilitated command above LMD, and 197% in partially completed&#13;
SRSP command below LMD (Annex 10). The net income of the average farms in both sub-projects&#13;
is currently at or below the AP absolute rural poverty threshold of Rs. 11,000/family. Since the&#13;
estimated net income increment for average SRSP farms ranges from Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 18,000, the&#13;
project would raise most land-owning farm families above the poverty threshold. The project R&amp;R&#13;
component would benefit families impoverished by land acquisition under previous projects within&#13;
the command area.&#13;
Irrigation Management Reform Benefits&#13;
5.05   Having served as a catalyst for GOAP irrigation sector management and fiscal reform, the&#13;
project would be a pilot to test management reform modalities for statewide adoption. The benefits&#13;
include determination of an effective process for: (a) empowerment of irrigators to take over the&#13;
operation and maintenance of minor canal networks by voluntary establishment of autonomous&#13;
WUAs; (b) involvement of irrigators in joint management of major canal schemes through&#13;
representation on Command Area Development Boards or Scheme Committees; and (c) transfer of a&#13;
part of the financial and management burden of canal network O&amp;M funding and enforcement of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
water delivery discipline to irrigation scheme beneficiaries with the objective of improving ICADD&#13;
irrigation services. An important benefit of the project would be the piloting of: (i) modalities to&#13;
realize GOAP's water rationing strategy for increasing the potential of upland canal commands&#13;
having scarce water resources; and (ii) ensuring reliable and adequate water supply to WUAs by&#13;
ICADD scheme organizations having main system O&amp;M and water management as their primary&#13;
function. Thus, success of the twin pronged approach of PIM and improved irrigation service under&#13;
the project would lay the foundation for improvement of irrigation efficiency in upland areas and&#13;
improve the ability of irrigation schemes to compete with the growing water demand of other&#13;
sectors. Improvement of ICADD implementation capacity in the area of construction quality&#13;
assurance, R&amp;R implementation and monitoring of large externally aided projects would also be a&#13;
beneficial outcome of the project.&#13;
B. Economic Justification&#13;
Economic Analysis Assumptions (Annex 10)&#13;
5.06   Assessment Scope. The economic analysis focuses on quantifying the net benefits of&#13;
irrigation on agricultural production and feeder road investments and on road users. The costs of the&#13;
agricultural support services program were included as necessary to achieve crop yields and the&#13;
diversified cropping pattern. The benefits were reduced by: (a) reduction in cultivated area due to land&#13;
required for civil works; and (b) the opportunity cost of hydroelectric power generation foregone due to&#13;
diversion of irrigation water to SRBC from the Srisailam multi-purpose reservoir. The economic rates&#13;
of return (ERRs) and Net Present Values (NPVs) have been calculated separately for: (i) the three&#13;
irrigation commands of the sub-project areas (SRBC, above LMD and below LMD in SRSP); (ii) SRSP&#13;
as a whole; and (iii) the overall project.&#13;
5.07   The R&amp;R costs related to the SRSP sub-project were excluded from the economic analysis&#13;
since they are not related to the benefits of irrigation scheme rehabilitation. The proposed SRSP&#13;
expenditures would address the impoverishment of people affected by irrigation works under the AP II&#13;
project outside the rehabilitated command area (para. 1.28) and are therefore not relevant to irrigation&#13;
investment decisions. Investment to ensure the safety of the Srisailam Dam spillway was also excluded&#13;
from the analysis because its benefits are largely attributable to the protection of the dam's&#13;
hydroelectric plants and major downstream facilities in the river basin. The costs and benefits of the&#13;
Environment Management Plan were excluded because most of the benefits are related to regional&#13;
environmental conservation and are difficult to quantify in economic terms.&#13;
5.08   Benefit Assumptions. The quantified benefits are mainly incremental agricultural production&#13;
due to assumed cropping pattern and productivity changes in each command, supplemented by the&#13;
estimated economic benefits attributed to feeder road investments (e.g. economic savings in vehicle&#13;
operating costs and travel time). In SRSP, the agricultural benefits are expected to come mainly from&#13;
significant shifts from low value to higher value crops as a result of rehabilitation of the existing&#13;
irrigation network and expansion of reliable canal irrigation to the whole command. For SRBC, project&#13;
benefits are derived from the change from rainfed to irrigated production in the form of higher crop&#13;
yields, an increase in cropping intensity and shift to higher value crops. The build-up rate of benefited&#13;
areas was derived from the projected command area contract completion schedule. The maturation rate&#13;
of irrigation benefits has been assumed over three years at a constant rate in already irrigated areas and&#13;
over five years in areas where large scale surface irrigation would be newly introduced. Benefits were&#13;
reduced by the agricultural production foregone due to project land acquisition and by the hydroelectric&#13;
power generation foregone at Srisailam Dam due to SRBC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
5.09   The "Without Project" (WOP) and With Project (WP) cropping patterns were based on&#13;
available data and Participatory Rural Appraisals to elicit farmer preferences under a reliable irrigation&#13;
water delivery hypothesis. The resulting cropping patterns assume a cropping intensity of 160% and&#13;
150% for SRBC and SRSP respectively. Achievement of these cropping intensities is very likely&#13;
because: (a) major canal schemes in AP have an average cropping intensity of 125-130%; and (b)&#13;
SRSP's above LMD command has a current cropping intensity of 147%. Crop yields were estimated&#13;
on the basis of available data and the considered opinion of GOAP and FAO agronomists with&#13;
reference to existing yields and the impact of irrigation. For example, yield increments in SRBC are&#13;
high because less than 10% of the area is irrigated at present, while crop yield increments for SRSP's&#13;
above LMD command are lower as yields already reflect partial irrigation coverage .&#13;
5.10   Given the uncertainties of private sector investment in wells after scheme rehabilitation, the&#13;
analysis postulates that the private development of groundwater would continue at the same level in&#13;
both the WP and WOP scenarios: accordingly their costs and benefits are excluded. It is therefore&#13;
assumed that in SRSP the additional wells installed by rice cultivators to cope with the rotational water&#13;
supply regime in the WP case would equal the number that would be installed as a response to&#13;
inadequate canal irrigation coverage under the WOP scenario. For SRBC, it is unlikely that&#13;
groundwater development will expand significantly beyond its present level as the geology of 70% of&#13;
the command does not lend itself to viable well development.&#13;
5.11   Analysis Parameters, Prices and Costs. All costs and benefits have been expressed in&#13;
1995 constant prices and are net of identifiable taxes. The analysis uses a project life of 30 years and an&#13;
opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The prices of all tradable commodities and imports are based on&#13;
world reference prices adjusted to site or farm-gate values. All local costs, including unskilled labor&#13;
wages and non-traded goods, were converted to economic costs and values by using a Standard&#13;
Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.90. Based on an analysis of taxes, duties, foreign exchange components,&#13;
local materials and labor charges of seven ongoing construction contracts, a conversion factor of 0.79&#13;
was used for valuation of irrigation works. Annual irrigation O&amp;M costs were assumed to be Rs.494/ha&#13;
and adjusted to economic values by using an SCF of 0.9 as inputs consist mostly of salaries, local&#13;
materials and unskilled labor. Hydroelectric power generation foregone by the project was valued at&#13;
Rs. 1.6/kwh (based on AP State Electricity Board estimates of the long-run marginal cost of electricity).&#13;
Based on local traffic surveys and rural road vehicle operating cost savings studies, the annual&#13;
economic benefits of feeder roads in SRSP and SRBC were estimated at Rs.227,465 and Rs.207,130&#13;
respectively.&#13;
Economic and Risk Analysis Findings (Annex 10)&#13;
5.12   Economic Evaluation Results. Based on the above assumptions, the economic evaluation&#13;
results for a base case scenario are summarized in Table 5.1 below.&#13;

The economic rate of return (ERR) of the whole project is estimated at 24% and the ERRs of sub-&#13;
projects are all favorable and higher than the 12% opportunity cost of capital. The present value of net&#13;
benefits (NPV) computed at the discount rate of 12% is positive for the whole project and the individual&#13;
commands. Although not relevant to the investment decision, the impact of sunk costs incurred under&#13;
the AP II project was evaluated. Expressed in constant 1995 prices, these expenditures amounted to&#13;
about Rs.4,405 million and of which SRBC sunk costs comprised 87%. Except for SRBC whose ERR&#13;
dropped to about 9%, the ERRs for SRSP and the whole project remained very favorable. These results&#13;
indicate that the project is justified, and not merely because its sunk costs have been excluded.&#13;
5.13    Sensitivity Analysis. "Switching values" were computed to determine the effect of deviations&#13;
from the main assumptions on the economic viability of the project: i.e. the value of the variable tested&#13;
which would reduce the present value of the project's net incremental benefits to zero when discounted&#13;
at a capital opportunity cost of 12%. The results indicate that, except for SRBC, ERRs of the above and&#13;
below LMD commands of SRSP are not very sensitive to substantial increases in the total costs,&#13;
particularly the construction costs, nor to substantial decreases in incremental benefits. The analysis&#13;
results are summarized in Table 5.2 below:&#13;

5.14   Economic Risk Analysis. The sensitivity of the economic analysis to planning assumptions,&#13;
as well as implementation risks, was analyzed. Fiscal and financial risks were analyzed separately&#13;
(paras. 5.16-5.32). The resulting ERR values are, for the most part, above 12% and indicate that&#13;
economic risks would not cause net benefits to drop below their switching value. The risk analysis&#13;
indicates that the project is robust, in economic terms, to deviations from appraisal assumptions.&#13;
This assessment is based on consideration of the following economic risks:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
Impact of Implementation Delays. In the event of plausible increases in the construction costs&#13;
(+20%) or delay in the project's expected benefits, ERRs would still be acceptable for individual&#13;
commands, the combined SRSP command and the whole project. The ERR of SRBC is relatively&#13;
more sensitive to delayed benefits than to increased construction costs. A combination of both&#13;
contingencies would cause the SRBC ERR to fall below the ERR cut-off rate although the project&#13;
ERR would remain acceptable. Cost overruns in excess of 20% are somewhat unlikely since: (a)&#13;
civil works costs based on the official "Schedule of Rates" are adjusted upward to reflect recent&#13;
tender rates; and (b) irrigation contracts consist of simple canal works except for SRBC Owk&#13;
Reservoir and Tunnel contracts which comprise less than 10% of SRBC civil works costs.&#13;
* Impact of Rice Cultivation. If planning assumptions are not realized with respect to the projected&#13;
cash crop cropping patterns, investment in all sub-project commands--including SRBC--remains&#13;
economically attractive. To assess the risk that rice cultivation would expand despite rotational&#13;
water supply, the analysis assumed an increase of 50% in rice area. As the water requirement for&#13;
paddy is about twice that of upland crops, any increment in rice area would result in reduction of&#13;
the dry crop area and a lower cropping intensity. Thus the reduction in cropping intensity is&#13;
significant at about 47% at above LMD, marginal at about 13% for below LMD and only 3% at&#13;
SRBC. However, since the farmgate economic returns from rice are about 80% higher than most&#13;
cash crops (except cotton), the reduced cropping intensity is offset by the higher value of rice and&#13;
ERRs do not drop significantly.&#13;
* Seasonal Water Supply Deficits. The water deficit risks were based on computation of an expected&#13;
value of net benefits using water supply probabilities derived from river basin mathematical&#13;
simulation models of each sub-project. Seasonal water deficits do affect sub-project ERRs but do&#13;
not cause them to fall below the 12% threshold, albeit that seasonal water deficits reduced expected&#13;
net benefits by 11% for SRBC, and by 10% and 16% for SRSP above and below LMD commands&#13;
respectively. The benefit reduction for SRSP's below LMD command is the largest as simulation&#13;
studies indicated that its water supply reliability was very sensitive to hydrological risk in the rabi&#13;
(post-monsoon) irrigation season. Consequently, the analysis assumed its water supply to be zero&#13;
in the rabi season during deficit years, whereas for the other two project commands, irrigation was&#13;
assumed to be curtailed by 50% in deficit years.&#13;
* Lower Crop Yields. For the yield reduction analysis, a 25% decrease was assumed for rice and&#13;
10% for other crops (Annex 10, para. 46). Except for the above LMD command, reduction in rice&#13;
yield did not have a major effect on ERRs because of its relatively small role in the cropping&#13;
pattern. However, when combined with yield shortfalls for all other crops, a significant reduction&#13;
of ERR ensues albeit not to critical levels (except for SRBC).&#13;

C. Financial and Fiscal Analysis&#13;
Analysis Background and Scope (Annex 11)&#13;
5.16   Sector Debt Service Expenditure. Public irrigation has been given the highest priority in&#13;
the State's capital budget and amounted to 20% of the total GOAP public investment and is now&#13;
about 1.2% of SGDP. Irrigation is the third largest sector in terms of total budgetary allocations after&#13;
welfare programs and education. The State's annual interest payments to GOI for irrigation debt are&#13;
substantial and increased from Rs.4 billion in FY93/94 to Rs.7.22 billion in FY95/96. In FY95/96,&#13;
debt service payments amounted to about 85% of irrigation sector's total revenue expenditure&#13;
account and comprised about 38% of the State's total debt service payments.&#13;
5.17   Sector O&amp;M  Expenditure. The most pressing financial problem faced by the AP public&#13;
irrigation sector is chronic under-funding of O&amp;M works has led to a decline of the net canal&#13;
command area from 2.8 million ha in FY90/91 to 2.3 million ha in FY94/95. The actual O&amp;M&#13;
allocation in real terms was kept at only about 24% of the actual funds needed for adequate upkeep&#13;
of the existing irrigation network. The average sector O&amp;M allocation in FY94/95 was Rs.300/ha of&#13;
which 30% was spent on salaries and ICADD overhead, 66% for repairing the ravages of deferred&#13;
maintenance and only 4% on normal maintenance. The inadequate O&amp;M allocation causes the&#13;
"deferred maintenance culture" currently practiced in the irrigation sector and inadequate cost&#13;
recovery has been the cause of under-funding of O&amp;M.&#13;
5.18   Sector Revenues. Because of the high share of irrigation expenditures in the total State&#13;
expenditures, inefficiency in the public irrigation sector generates an adverse multiplier effect on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
overall efficiency and growth in the economy. Prior to the recent increase in irrigation water charges&#13;
and agricultural power tariffs, surface and groundwater irrigation subsidies have reached 260% of the&#13;
total budgetary allocations to the irrigation sector and comprised about 6% of the state revenue&#13;
deficit. Direct cost recovery through water charges has been about 0.5% of agricultural value added.&#13;
Revenue from irrigation water charges in FY94/95 accounted for less than 1% of total GSDP. Despite&#13;
their low levels, water charges are generally perceived by farmers as taxes and not as user charges for&#13;
public irrigation services. FY94/95 water charge revenue collection amounted to 78% of the water&#13;
charge assessment: Compared to previous years, FY94/95 represents a drastic decline in collection&#13;
efficiency per gross irrigated ha which had attained 97% in FY93/94.&#13;
5.19   Requisite Analysis Scope. The current Andhra Pradesh fiscal crisis (para. 1.07) and sector&#13;
fiscal management thus gives rise to sector financial sustainability questions that need to be assessed&#13;
in addition to the conventional financial assessment of the project's direct and indirect cost recovery&#13;
potential and farmers' ability to pay irrigation water charges. These questions relate to: (a) the&#13;
incremental impact of project debt service needs on irrigation sector revenue expenditure; (b) the&#13;
impact of increased water charges and indirect project cost recovery revenue generated by&#13;
incremental agricultural sales taxes; (c) the state's fiscal capacity to meet project debt service&#13;
payments and O&amp;M funding needs; (d) the minimal irrigation water charge and indirect cost&#13;
recovery collection efficiency required to ensure adequate coverage of project debt service and O&amp;M&#13;
funding requirements; (e) the impact of statewide partial management turnover to WUAs on the&#13;
sector and project O&amp;M funding burden.&#13;
5.20   The above considerations all have a bearing on the question of whether adequate funding of&#13;
project O&amp;M can be sustained after cessation of Bank assistance. The sector fiscal health and&#13;
project debt service capacity issue arises out of the grant and loan arrangement by which the&#13;
proposed credit/loan of US$325 million would be on-lent to GOAP as additional central assistance.&#13;
The project IDA/IBRD credit/loan is made to GOI under standard terms and conditions and GOI&#13;
assumes the foreign exchange and variable interest rate risks. However, the 30% of this amount is&#13;
made available to AP as a GOI grant while the remaining 70% is on-lent under GOI's standard terms&#13;
and conditions3 at an interest rate of 13%. Thus the loan's impact on sector debt service repayment&#13;
needs to be kept in view when state finances are under stress.&#13;
Financial Analysis (Annex 11)&#13;
5.21   Water Charge and O&amp;M Funding Assumptions. Firstly, the irrigation water charge rates&#13;
used in the analysis are those expected to be in effect by July 1, 1997. (Annex 11, para. 11). Since&#13;
rotational (intermittent) water supply would be the mode of water delivery for each command after&#13;
its de-localization to ID status (paras. 1.15-1.16), it is assumed the wet crop (rice) cultivators would&#13;
be charged a flat rate of Rs.247/ha. Secondly, it is expected that, given the increased water charges,&#13;
GOAP will provide for a statewide increase in irrigation O&amp;M expenditures under its fiscal adjustment&#13;
program. Because the predominant crop grown on existing canal schemes in AP is rice, it is tentatively&#13;
assumed for the purposes of this analysis that the O&amp;M allocation would be raised in future from&#13;
Rs.300/ha/year to Rs.494/ha/year (Annex 11, para. 14). This increase would also facilitate essential&#13;
scheme rehabilitation to overcome the ravages of deferred maintenance (para. 5.17) and enable turnover&#13;
The loan is divided equally into two parts: the first half is recovered at an interest rate of 13% per&#13;
annum over 10 years without a grace period; the second half is also recovered at an interest rate of&#13;
13% but over 15 years after a grace period of 5 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
of tertiary networks to WUAs. Thirdly, based on ICADD data for the SRSP scheme, it is assumed that&#13;
where WUAs manage minor canals in their jurisdiction, only half of the GOAP maintenance budget&#13;
would be required by ICADD for the main network. When WUAs are fully established and responsible&#13;
for their minor network under a MOU with ICADD (paras. 2.32-2.36), actual O&amp;M expenses for the&#13;
minor canal network would be provided by WUA members in cash and kind, and from a 40% rebate on&#13;
water charges under a proposed revenue sharing scheme (para. 4.10).&#13;
5.22   Indirect Cost Recovery via Agricultural Sales Taxes. Indirect taxation accounts for about&#13;
72% of total state tax revenues of which the most important was the sales tax on agricultural products&#13;
which averages 4% of gross output. Given that irrigated areas have a higher crop yield than rainfed&#13;
areas, the incremental sales tax on their incremental output may be regarded as an indirect cost recovery&#13;
mechanism which contributes to general state revenue. Accordingly, since the project's output would&#13;
generate incremental agricultural sales tax revenues, these were included in the analysis as an indirect&#13;
source of cost recovery. Using the project farm models, the per ha incremental sales tax revenue for&#13;
SRBC is estimated at over 600% (because of the change from rainfed to irrigated production), while&#13;
that of SRSP ranges from 200-300%. The total incremental agricultural sales tax revenue is estimated&#13;
at Rs.485.6 million (Annex 11, para. 18 and Table 5).&#13;
5.23   Project Rent Recovery Index. For the assessment of the project's farmers ability to pay the&#13;
increased water charge, the Project Rent--defined as the incremental net benefit per ha due to the&#13;
project after deduction of appropriate allowances for management and risk--has been estimated for&#13;
each sub-project using the representative farm models (para SS). Using the incremental water charges&#13;
and estimated average farm budgets under the WOP and WP scenarios, the Project Rent for an average&#13;
project farm would be substantial. The rent could vary from about Rs.9,807/ha to Rs.15,290/ha in&#13;
SRSP's above and below LMD areas respectively and attain Rs.23,783/ha in the SRBC area. Whereas&#13;
project rent constitutes about 91% of the present value of incremental project net income, the project&#13;
rent recovery index4 is only 10% (i.e. only 10% of the rent is recovered through water charges and&#13;
agricultural sales taxes). The project rent recovery index considering only water charge revenue is&#13;
about 8%. The rent recovery indices indicate that, if the project net benefits would materialize, there&#13;
could be scope to increase cost recovery further if necessary by raising water charges, or at least&#13;
maintaining a high collection efficiency.&#13;
5.24   Project Cost Recovery Index. For the assessment of the ability of the increased water charge&#13;
as a revenue generation mechanism for recovery for project costs, the project cost recovery indices5&#13;
were computed. The cost recovery index of assumed O&amp;M costs by potential water charge revenues is&#13;
66%. However, a O&amp;M requirement of Rs.494/ha is rather high for rehabilitated or new schemes and it&#13;
is likely that ICADD would allocate a lower unit O&amp;M budget to the project commands (at least in its&#13;
early years). Since current SRSP staff costs are about Rs. 160/ha, this would leave Rs.324/ha for normal&#13;
O&amp;M. It may be expected that actual O&amp;M requirements would be much lower and that the increased&#13;
water charges would be adequate to cover O&amp;M costs for the project. This would remain true even if&#13;
The Rent Recovery Index is the percentage ratio between the incremental per ha tax and water charge&#13;
revenues and the unit Project Rent. All amounts are expressed in present values discounted at 12%&#13;
over 30 years in constant 1995 prices.&#13;
The Cost Recovery Index is the percentage ratio between the per ha cost recovery revenues&#13;
(incremental water charges and agricultural sales tax revenues) and incremental unit irrigation capital&#13;
and O&amp;M costs. All amounts are expressed in present values discounted at 12% over 30 years in&#13;
constant 1995 prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
water charge revenues are shared with WUAs in return for assuming the O&amp;M burden of the minor&#13;
canal systems of SRSP and SRSP.&#13;
5.25   Considering the contribution of incremental sales taxes, the project cost recovery index in terms&#13;
of O&amp;M costs alone is 285% while the cost recovery index for both capital and O&amp;M costs is 19%.&#13;
After deducting full recovery of estimated O&amp;M costs, incremental sales tax revenues are able to&#13;
recover about 13-14% of project capital costs during the project's economic life of 30 years. Given the&#13;
reliance of GOAP on indirect taxation, the effective rate of cost recovery is probably understated as&#13;
increased agricultural income would generate growth in other sectors of the economy and thus&#13;
additional revenue through other tax measures.&#13;
Fiscal Analysis (Annex 11)&#13;
5.26   Project Fiscal Impact Assumptions.  Assuming constant 1995/96 prices, the proposed&#13;
project as a whole would incur average annual expenditures of Rs.2.86 billion of which GOAP's annual&#13;
average counterpart contribution would be Rs.0.91 billion with the remainder being financed by&#13;
additional central assistance facilitated by Bank/IDA financing. Assuming that, with fiscal reform to&#13;
reduce the state's current fiscal deficit, GOAP could maintain its FY95/96 level of sector capital&#13;
expenditures (Rs.6.83 billion), the project's annual counterpart capital outlay would comprise about&#13;
13% of irrigation capital expenditures. Thus if the sector capital budget is not increased, expenditure on&#13;
other ongoing projects may have to be curtailed. In terms of debt service obligations to GOI, standard&#13;
on-lending conditions would entail an average annual project debt service of about Rs.0.801 billion and&#13;
increase the current sector average annual debt service amount by 11%. Assuming that, with fiscal&#13;
reform, the total sector revenue expenditure can be maintained at the FY95/96 level of Rs.8.54 billion,&#13;
the project's annual debt service would comprise about 9.4% of total sector revenue expenditure.&#13;
5.27   Annual revenue expenditure for project O&amp;M  a few years after completion of SRBC&#13;
construction and SRSP rehabilitation is estimated at Rs. 157.1 million if the full O&amp;M burden remains&#13;
with GOAP, or Rs.94 million if ICADD only bears 60% and the remainder is bome by WUAs6. Sector&#13;
revenue expenditure for O&amp;M at Rs.494/ha (para. 5.21) is estimated at Rs. 1,212 million after project&#13;
completion. Thus project O&amp;M costs would comprise about 13% and 8% sector O&amp;M revenue&#13;
expenditure without and with WUA burden sharing respectively. The project share of O&amp;M&#13;
expenditure may be smaller in the initial years as the works would be new. However, for the purposes&#13;
of a sectoral analysis, project O&amp;M costs are assumed to increase after several years and equal those of&#13;
other projects.&#13;
5.28   Project Debt Service Deficit. Under the revised water charge structure, the project could&#13;
generate a total annual potential revenue of Rs.603.4 million annual consisting water charge assessment&#13;
of Rs.1 17.8 million7 and potential agricultural sales tax revenues of about Rs.485.6 million (para. 5.22).&#13;
This revenue would cover only 63% of the total annual average expenditure of Rs.958.1 million&#13;
consisting of the estimated project O&amp;M requirement (para. 5.27) and annual average debt service&#13;
(para. 5.26), while the potential water charge revenue would cover 75% of the assumed O&amp;M cost.&#13;
These findings are similar to those of the cost recovery index calculation (para. 5.24). The cost&#13;
6      Based on a command area of 318,000 ha for both sub-projects and an estimated O&amp;M budget of&#13;
Rs.494/ha. If revenue sharing is instituted whereby 40% of the water charge is returned to WUAs and&#13;
10% to Gram Panchayats, it is assumed that GOAP will only budget Rs.247/ha for O&amp;M.&#13;
7      Based on a uniform water charge of only Rs.247/ha (para. 5.21).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
recovery revenue deficit of Rs.354.7 million could be regarded as reducing the cost recovery efficacy of&#13;
agricultural sales taxes from the agricultural production of other irrigation projects whose potential&#13;
annual sales tax revenue is estimated at Rs.1,101 million. To maintain the irrigation sector's fiscal&#13;
status quo, the project debt service deficit would have to be made up by increased state revenue&#13;
generated by other fiscal reforms and adjustments currently being actively pursued by GOAP in&#13;
consultation with the Bank.&#13;
5.29    Impact of Revenue Collection Efficiency.  The foregoing analysis may be regarded as&#13;
theoretical as it compares project costs with potential revenues in the form of projected water charge&#13;
and agricultural sales tax revenue assessments that ostensibly could be made by the state&#13;
government's Revenue Department that collects both water charges and sales taxes. Given shortfalls&#13;
in water charge collection such as those of FY94/95 (Annex 11, para. 9), overall cost recovery would&#13;
be lower and depend on the Revenue Department's collection efficiency of both water charge&#13;
assessments and sales taxes. In the absence of data on actual sales tax collection efficiency within&#13;
the irrigation commands of AP it is assumed--for the purposes of analysis--that the collection&#13;
efficiencies of both revenue sources are identical.&#13;
5.30    Assuming that existing public canal schemes and minor irrigation tanks totaling 2.135&#13;
million ha (excluding SRSP) achieve the present average cropping intensities of 125% and 115%&#13;
respectively, and that about 90% of the gross cropped area consists of wet crops, a potential water&#13;
charge revenue assessment of Rs.1.35 billion could be expected under the new water charge rate&#13;
structure (Annex 11). This amount is about 330% larger than the sector water charge assessment&#13;
made by the Revenue Department in FY94/95 under the previous rate structure. An analysis was&#13;
thus made of the ability of sector water charge revenues and project agricultural sales tax revenues to&#13;
recover sector O&amp;M costs and project debt service under different revenue collection efficiencies.&#13;
The analysis was repeated for a scenario which assumes that the all canal schemes are organized&#13;
under WUAs and a revenue sharing arrangement. The results are summarized as shown in Table 5.4&#13;
below.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
5.31   It is seen that there is only a marginal difference in project debt service recovery between&#13;
with and without WUA/revenue sharing scenarios. In both cases, sector water charge revenues&#13;
substantially recover O&amp;M expenditure except that with WUAs only about half the O&amp;M burden is&#13;
carried by the state. When revenue collection efficiency drops to 75%, the unrecovered O&amp;M&#13;
expenditure and project debt burden is equivalent to about two thirds of the estimated agricultural&#13;
sales revenue generated by all existing public irrigation schemes; with WUAs this amount increases&#13;
to about three quarters. Thus in order to maintain the fiscal and operational advantages of WUAs&#13;
without compromising capital cost recovery, it is essential that every effort be made to maintain&#13;
water charge efficiency at a level of 90% or more.&#13;
5.32   Overall Project Fiscal Viability Assessment. The analysis indicates that the significant fiscal&#13;
burden of the project may be offset provided efforts are made to maintain a revised water charge and&#13;
agricultural sales tax collection efficiency of at least 75%. Joint management of irrigation schemes by&#13;
establishment of WUAs would significantly reduce GOAP's O&amp;M burden expenditure burden albeit&#13;
that a significant rebate of water charges is contemplated. The project design has considered fiscal risks&#13;
by requiring the establishment of a Water Charge Review Committee which would periodically review&#13;
water charge assessment and charge collection efficiency and advise government of the adjustments&#13;
required to maintain the financial viability of the public irrigation sector.&#13;
D. Project Risks&#13;
5.33   Government Commitment.  Waning GOAP commitment is a risk.  However, all&#13;
indications point to very strong GOAP commitment to ensure that project implementation does not&#13;
fail in the manner of AP II and that its irrigation management reform piloting aspects will succeed.&#13;
Firstly, GOAP is engaged in fiscal adjustment dialogue with the Bank as part of a very large&#13;
assistance program for FY98/99 and, despite its fiscal difficulties, has agreed to an exclusive escrow&#13;
account for funds received as retroactive finance (para. 3.18). It published a White Paper irrigation&#13;
financial difficulties and undertook statewide public consultations prior to the politically risky major&#13;
increase of irrigation water charges. Secondly, success of the project is vital for the sustainability of&#13;
the AP public irrigation sector in general and, in particular, for satisfying the local political and inter-&#13;
state water sharing imperatives motivating the development of upcoming upland irrigation projects.&#13;
GOAP has undertaken a series of frank political and beneficiary consultations about the SRSP canal&#13;
operation policy which caused problems under AP II before issuing Orders for the final de-&#13;
localization of the SRSP command. Thirdly, its commitment to a publicly announced joint irrigation&#13;
management policy and beneficiary empowerment under WUAs extends beyond the project and&#13;
receives support from the government's highest levels. GOAP is now in the process of establishing&#13;
WUAs in all its major irrigation schemes without Bank support or pre-conditions. Fourth, GOAP&#13;
supports the agreed project R&amp;R Policy despite its precedent setting financial implications for other&#13;
ongoing and future irrigation projects. However, notwithstanding GOAP's commitment, there are&#13;
several ubiquitous project risks to be contained as described below.&#13;
5.34   Implementation Agency Motivation Risks.  The enunciated GOAP commitment to&#13;
improved irrigation service and beneficiary empowerment may not be enthusiastically shared by an&#13;
agency such as ICADD whose staff motivation traditionally lies in executing civil works. This risk&#13;
has been addressed in project design. Firstly, NGOs will play a major role as Social Organizers in&#13;
establishing WUAs and in assisting GOAP revenue and rural agencies in R&amp;R implementation.&#13;
Secondly, project preparation has led to strengthening the role of CAD by appointment of an CAD&#13;
Commissioner of Joint Secretary rank, while project design requires: (a) transfer of SRSP O&amp;M&#13;
functions to its CADA under a CADA Administrator with two year tenure; (b) establishment of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
CADA Agricultural Engineering Wing using agriculture staff; (c) significant beneficiary&#13;
representation on the CADA Board; and (d) placement of minor canal gate operators under WUA&#13;
control. Thirdly, the agronomy and extension component and the Environmental Management Plan&#13;
will be respectively implemented by WALAMTARI and SFDC, i.e. by agencies seeking to expand&#13;
their role and therefore with an incentive to performn. Difficult project staffing issues are to be&#13;
resolved by the Empowered Committee while general problems of redundant ICADD staff are being&#13;
addressed by GOAP.&#13;
5.35   Implementation Capacity and Delay Risks.  The economic analysis has indicated&#13;
sensitivity to delayed benefits which would arise from delay in completion of irrigation works. The&#13;
principal sources of this implementation risk are delayed civil works procurement (including&#13;
excessive bid values in relation project estimates), delayed transfer of funds to implementation units&#13;
and construction contract management disputes. There is also a risk that poor construction quality&#13;
could shorten the economic lifetime of canal structures and thus curtail the area irrigated. Aside of&#13;
GOAP desire not to let implementation delays reoccur by using an Empowered Committee to&#13;
monitor implementation and resolve issues causing delay, these risks are mitigated in the project&#13;
design. The safeguards include: (a) the escrow account which provides an initial buffer against&#13;
delays in resource transfer from GOI and within GOAP and the proposed Annual Review, Action&#13;
Plan and Budget process for monitoring and control of project implementation; (b) completion of bid&#13;
documents prior to project start-up; (c) use of a tender premium in base cost estimates, rigorous post-&#13;
qualification where possible to minimize bidder collusion and ensure selection of competent&#13;
contractors; (d) specification of canal rehabilitation "construction windows" in bid documents to&#13;
elicit competitive bidding; (e) bid validity and evaluation time limitations; (f) continuation of the&#13;
job-specific daily OK Card system for monitoring supervision and contractor performance; and (f)&#13;
use of an independent adjudicator for initial contract dispute resolution. ICADD has already proved&#13;
its ability to deliver good construction quality and this would be strengthened by expansion of the&#13;
training component of the construction quality assurance program and quality monitoring&#13;
organization.&#13;
5.36   Beneficiary Response Risks. The risks that farmer production response may not coincide&#13;
with project plans have been assessed by the economic analysis and have been found not to be overly&#13;
critical in economic efficiency terms. However, there are other irrigator response risks which may&#13;
arise during project implementation which could be more critical in reducing project benefits.&#13;
Firstly, control of wasteful irrigation in SRSP's above LMD command may not be fully achieved&#13;
despite rotational water supply and WUA management of farm water deliveries. Thus, the water&#13;
supply to the below LMD command would be less reliable than forecast by the sub-project&#13;
simulation model. Secondly, the irrigation agronomy extension program may not be effective in&#13;
training farmers in improved water management. The project design has tried to mitigate the risks of&#13;
wasteful irrigation by placing irrigators served by direct outlets from large canals within the&#13;
jurisdiction of WlUAs and it is expected that the proposed partial devolution of ICADD's disciplinary&#13;
powers to WUAs will enable enforcement of discipline. It is also assumed that rehabilitation of this&#13;
command will create a political lobby that would be brought to bear on water wastage and excessive&#13;
water consumption by farmers in the above LMD command.&#13;
5.37   Financial Sustainability Risks. There is a risk that water charge and agricultural sales tax&#13;
collection efficiency may be lower than anticipated due to the higher charge levels and other GOAP&#13;
fiscal reform measures to increase revenue by taxation. As this could affect project cost recovery, a&#13;
provision has been made to monitor water charge assessment and collection in the SRSP sub-project&#13;
(para. 4.37). The monitoring results would also serve as an input to the GOAP Water Charge Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
Committee which is to monitor statewide water charge revenue collection (para. 4.11). The risk of&#13;
inadequate O&amp;M budgeting would arise if water charge collection efficiency is low. It is assumed&#13;
that the O&amp;M burden would be reduced by turn-over of the minor canal system to WUAs and by the&#13;
statewide water charge revenue sharing proposal for water charge rebates to WUAs to promote their&#13;
assumption of the canal maintenance burden. Nevertheless, there remains a risk that-in the future--&#13;
fiscal pressures and completion of other large projects may result in erosion of the ICADD's O&amp;M&#13;
budget for those works it remains responsible for.&#13;
5.38   Water Availability Risks.  There is some risk that future irrigation development by&#13;
upstream riparian states could reduce water availability to the project commands and that reservoir&#13;
sedimentation may reduce water supply reliability. These risks have been assessed by simulation&#13;
models (Annex 1) and are deemed unlikely because: (a) the SRSP command area supported by the&#13;
project has been limited to the existing potential created; (b) SRBC water supply reliability has been&#13;
assessed on the assumption of full future development of the Krishna river basin; and (c) the models&#13;
were run assuming expected reservoir capacity levels after 50 and 75 years of sedimentation.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.01   Assurances. At Negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOAP that:&#13;

funds required for the project to the project entities (para 3.21); and&#13;
(b) project accounts, including the Special Account and Escrow Account, would be&#13;
maintained and audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards&#13;
consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank/IDA,&#13;
and certified copies of the annual financial statements and SOEs together with the&#13;
auditors report, which would comment separately on the SOEs, would be submitted to&#13;
the Bank/IDA not later than six months after the close of each GOAP fiscal year (para.&#13;
3.24).&#13;
6.03   Understandings. At Negotiations, the following understandings were reached with GOAP&#13;
with respect to procurement of civil works contracts (para. 3.14):&#13;
(a) As a minimum, all bid invitations would be advertised in newspaper with national&#13;
circulation and shall contain the key post-qualification requirements in summary form.&#13;
Bid documents shall be provided promptly upon request, upon payment of the prescribed&#13;
fee, and shall be sent by mail upon request.&#13;
(b) During pre-bid conferences, bidders should be clearly advised about: (i) Conditions of&#13;
Contract ("Technical Expert" adjudicator for large civil works, default provisions, post-&#13;
qualification requirements, etc.); (ii) streamlined processing to elicit competitive&#13;
bidding; and (iii) the high likelihood of being declared unresponsive if all qualification&#13;
data and securities are not provided in bid documentation.&#13;
(c) Bids shall be evaluated within 30 days of bid opening and recommendations for contract&#13;
award should be forwarded to the Bank/IDA for review where necessary (prior review)&#13;
within 60 days thereof, and all contracts signed within the bid validity period of 90 days.&#13;
Any justifications for extension of bid validity shall be cleared with the Bank/IDA to&#13;
preclude forfeit of financing for bids not awarded within a reasonable time.&#13;
6.04   At Negotiations, GOAP confirmed that:&#13;
(a) the OK Card quality assurance system will be maintained for all SRBC and SRSP civil&#13;
works (para. 2.28);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
(b) it accepted the Baseline Survey terms of reference and Project Performance Monitoring&#13;
Indicators, and a data collection and processing system would be established to facilitate&#13;
regular reporting of the project output and implementation progress indicators in project&#13;

INDIA&#13;
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT&#13;
WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Overview of Water Availability Issues&#13;
Interstate Rivers&#13;
1.    The Interstate Water Disputes Act. Water is a State subject under the Indian Constitution.&#13;
Riparian disputes about the sharing and development of the waters of an interstate river are resolved&#13;
and regulated by the Union Government by means of The Interstate Water Disputes Act passed in 1956.&#13;
The Act provides for setting up a Tribunal to adjudicate in case of a dispute about water of an interstate&#13;
river or river basin. The Act is set into motion on a complaint made by a state party to the central&#13;
government, who constitutes a Tribunal at its discretion for resolution of the dispute. The Tribunal may&#13;
apportion flow to downstream riparian states and also among existing schemes, future projects and&#13;
beneficial uses (e.g. hydro-power) brought before the Tribunal by the riparian states.&#13;
2.     Project Interstate Rivers. The proposed project (AP III) would support further development&#13;
and management of the waters of the Krishna and Godavari rivers for irrigation within Andhra Pradesh&#13;
(AP). The Krishna River Basin drains 258,848 km2 of catchment from its headwaters to the Bay of&#13;
Bengal and its river network flows through the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and AP. The Godavari&#13;
River drains a catchment of 309,760 km covering the states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and AP.&#13;
The project includes: (a) completion of the 65,000 ha Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC) sub-&#13;
project which is to receive its water supply from the Srisailam Reservoir on the Krishna River; and (b)&#13;
rehabilitation the 253,000 ha Sriramasagar Project (SRSP) which receives the bulk of its water supplies&#13;
from the Sriramasagar Reservoir on the Godavari River and supplementary supplies from the Lower&#13;
Mannair Dam (LMD) located on the Mannair River (a small tributary of the Godavari river within AP).&#13;
Since interstate water disputes had arisen on both the Krishna and Godavari rivers, riparian state water&#13;
sharing is based on allocations determined by the Awards made by two Tribunals under the 1956 Act.&#13;
The Srisailam Right Branch Canal Project&#13;
3.     Srisailam Reservoir. The idea of utilizing Krishna River waters to irrigate the drought-&#13;
prone upper Pennar river basin in the Rayalaseema region is more than 100 years old. The first&#13;
attempt was the Kumool-Cuddapah (KC) Canal scheme (IBRD Map BBB), begun in 1872 which, by&#13;
diversion from the Krishna river and through a system of multiple pick-ups from the Kundu river (a&#13;
tributary of the Pennar River), enabled progressive utilization of return flows to irrigate about 88,814&#13;
ha on the east bank of the Kundu River . The area of the SRBC project on the right bank of the&#13;
Kundu, about 130 km long and 5-10 km wide, and having a cultivable command area (CCA) of&#13;
77,000 ha, became potentially irrigable only after completion of the Srisailam Reservoir (IBRD Map&#13;
BBB) on the Krishna River in the late 1970s.&#13;
4.     The Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal Award. In 1973, the Krishna Water Disputes&#13;
Tribunal (KWDT) allocated 2060 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) or 58,333 million cubic metres&#13;
(Mm) of the Krishna River's estimated 75% dependable annual water yield (para BB) between the&#13;
three riparian States involved. The Award is distributed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 19&#13;
Andhra Pradesh                    800 TMC (22,654 Mm3)&#13;
Maharastra                        560 TMC (15,857 Mm3)&#13;
Karnataka                         700 TMC (19,822 Mm3).&#13;
The water utilization of existing projects in all three co-basin states as of September 1960 was&#13;
protected within the KWDT allocations. The Award further confines planned irrigation development&#13;
by the two upstream riparian states in the Krishna basin to be consistent with the above allocations.&#13;
The KWDT Award covered existing (at the time) uses and all future allocations and is therefore quite&#13;
specific. Review in the year 2000 AD is dependent on any one riparian State requesting it.&#13;
5.    A further 70 TMC (1982 Mm3) of estimated irrigation return flow (regeneration) within the&#13;
basin was allocated to the states by the KWDT. Since AP had already fully utilised its KWDT&#13;
allocation for existing projects, its allocation was augmented by the KWDT to 811 TMC (22,965 Mm3),&#13;
i.e. to include 11 TMC (311 Mm3) of the regeneration flow amount. According to a subsequent KWDT&#13;
Order issued in 1976, AP is permitted to use any surplus waters in excess of 800 TMC reaching its&#13;
border up to the year 2000 AD without conferring a future right to these flows.&#13;
6.    Interstate Agreements. During the 1970s, it became clear that Madras City in Tamil Nadu&#13;
(TN) requires water from the Krishna to ensure its municipal and industrial requirements, the three&#13;
Krishna basin states each allocated 5 TMC of their KWDT share, i.e. totaling 15 TMC (425 Mm3), to&#13;
TN for Madras City. Thus it became necessary to skim water from the Srisailam reservoir without&#13;
passing it through the turbines, and convey it by canal through a number of balancing reservoirs to&#13;
the AP/TN border via a canal financed by TN. The so-called Telegu Ganga Canal (TGC) would&#13;
divert 15 TMC of surplus Krishna flows over a period of 3-4 monsoon months and deliver 12 TMC&#13;
(allowing for losses) to storage facilities in TN for Madras's use over an eight month period. Once&#13;
the cost of water transfer via the TGC from the Srisailam Reservoir to the Pennar basin would be&#13;
thus covered, AP conceived three new irrigation projects to utilize its return flow award and the&#13;
sanction to use surplus waters for irrigation of its poorest and drought-prone Rayalaseema region.&#13;
Tamil Nadu agreed that TGC could serve the Telegu Ganga Project (TGP) which would be based on&#13;
diversion of 29 TMC (821 Mm3) of Krishna surplus flows from Srisailam Reservoir into the TGC to&#13;
irrigate about 117,000 ha. GOAP has also planned another project to utilize 30 TMC of its surplus&#13;
Krishna water called the Srisailam Left Branch Canal Project (SLBC).&#13;
7.    SRBC Water Allocation. The third new project, SRBC, was not specifically given an&#13;
allocation by the KWDT. However the scheme's 19 TMC (538 Mm 3) planned water requirement was&#13;
originally cleared by the GOI Planning Commission on May 16, 1981. Since then, the 11 TMC (311&#13;
Mm3) regeneration amount awarded by the KWDT to AP has been allocated to SRBC by Government&#13;
Order (GO-Ms No. 154 dated June 6, 1994). The same Order included a statement of intent for&#13;
obtaining the remaining 8 TMC (227 Mm3) by "..modernisation of KC Canal system or any other&#13;
system.". GOAP has since concluded an Agreement with the Japanese Overseas Economic&#13;
Cooperation Fund for grant financing of KC Canal relining and modernization works. It is assumed&#13;
that the water savings obtained by this project would facilitate greater irrigation efficiency in the KC&#13;
Canal scheme and enable water to be made available for SRBC consumptive use.&#13;
8.    SRBC Water Supply. SRBC's water supply is obtained by an off-take from the TGC at a&#13;
distance of 19.4 km from Srisailam Reservoir. Accordingly, the main canal leaving the reservoir was&#13;
designed for a capacity of 315.7 m3 per second (cumec) to cater for both SRBC, TGP and Madras&#13;
needs on the assumption of diversion of surplus Krishna waters from Srisailam Reservoir during a 3&#13;
to 4 month monsoon period. The SRBC main canal was planned to carry a maximum discharge of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 3 of 19&#13;
140.5 cumec for a distance of about 50 km to the command area. This capacity was selected on the&#13;
assumption that at least 12.82 TMC would also be diverted during the monsoon months for storage&#13;
in two balancing reservoirs: Gorakullu Reservoir with a live storage of 10.73 TMC at km 50 of the&#13;
SRBC main canal, and Owk Reservoir with a live storage of 2.09 TMC at km 116 of the SRBC main&#13;
canal. Construction of the SRBC main canal began under the Bank-assisted Second Andhra Pradesh&#13;
Irrigation Project (AP II).&#13;
9.     AP II Water Availability Issues. The AP II project appraisal mission determined that a&#13;
reliable water supply was possible without construction of the Gorakullu and Owk Reservoirs as&#13;
proposed by GOAP. By elimination of these reservoirs, the SRBC scheme's operation was to be based&#13;
on continuous abstraction from Srisailam Reservoir for 9-10 months during the irrigation season instead&#13;
of reliance on off-channel reservoirs filled in 3-4 months during the monsoon season only. It therefore&#13;
became important to operate Srisailam Reservoir in such a manner that it could supply SRBC's&#13;
irrigation needs throughout the irrigation season. Nevertheless, during AP II implementation and&#13;
despite a GOAP assurance that 19 TMC would always be allocated to SRBC, water availability for&#13;
SRBC and operation of Srisailam Reservoir became an issue between the Bank and GOAP. Thus when&#13;
the preparation of the proposed AP III project began, GOAP claimed that the two off-channel reservoirs&#13;
(Gorakullu and Owk) having a combined gross storage capacity of 17.92 TMC were necessary to&#13;
ensure a water supply reliability of 75% for SRBC as per Indian planning standards. Accordingly,&#13;
GOAP also proposed to extend the SRBC cultivable command area (CCA) from 65,000 ha to 77,000 ha&#13;
as originally envisaged when the project was approved by GOI in 1981.&#13;
10.    SRBC Project Preparation Issues. The project preparation mission found that: (a) no design&#13;
studies and investigations had been undertaken for the enlarged command; (b) the proposed Srisailam&#13;
Reservoir operating rules resulted in a higher supply reliability for the proposed TGP and SLBC&#13;
schemes than for SRBC (which had an identifiable water allocation derived from the KWDT Award&#13;
and was already under construction); (c) aside of requiring relocation of a large village, the Gorakullu&#13;
Reservoir site was located over karstic limestone outcrops and that its viability could not be ascertained&#13;
without extensive and time-consuming investigations; (d) the SRBC main canal excavation had&#13;
progressed to about km 100 and its alignment could not be practically changed to eliminate the Owk&#13;
Tunnel and Reservoir; and (e) the Owk Reservoir's gross capacity would have to be reduced from 4.86&#13;
TMC to 1.86 TMC (live storage 0.84 TMC) by lowering its level by 7 m so as not to relocate a village&#13;
and to prevent possible water leakage through karstic limestone outcrops at the higher elevations.&#13;
11.    Given these findings, the Bank requested GOAP to review its project simulation studies to&#13;
determine SRBC water supply reliability without the Gorakullu Reservoir. The cardinal assumptions of&#13;
this review were: (a) use of the agreed hydrological series developed by the KWDT in determining&#13;
water allocations to the riparian states; and (b) that proposed projects such as TGP and SLBC would be&#13;
included in the simulation so as to determine SRBC supply reliability under full development within&#13;
AP. The review was to investigate alternative operating rules for the Srisailam Reservoir which would&#13;
ensure supply reliability to SRBC without Gorakullu Reservoir and with an Owk Reservoir of reduced&#13;
capacity. These studies were also to allow for the need to augment the water supply to Hyderabad. In&#13;
parallel, GOAP was also to begin investigation of the sedimentation rates of Srisailam Reservoir as only&#13;
one reservoir survey had been conducted in the 1980s. Thus it became relevant to also investigate&#13;
water reliability sensitivity to long term reservoir storage reduction.&#13;
12.    The outcome of these studies--described herein--resulted in a reformulation of the SRBC&#13;
project design, namely, that the Gorakullu Reservoir would not be necessary for irrigation of 65,000 ha&#13;
and that a reduced capacity Owk Reservoir would be included in the project. A pumping station would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 19&#13;
be installed at Owk Reservoir in order to utilise 0.64 TMC of dead storage for supply augmentation.&#13;
Since the SRBC main canal had already been excavated to its original capacity as a flood flow canal&#13;
under AP II, the present design leaves GOAP the option of possibly building Gorakullu Reservoir and&#13;
expanding the Owk reservoir to full capacity in the post-project period if economical solutions to the&#13;
potential reservoir leakage problems could be found.&#13;
The Sriramasagar Sub-Project&#13;
13.    Sriramasagar Reservoir and Lower Mannair Dam. For a few hundred years, irrigation in&#13;
AP's drought-prone Telangana Region had existed in small areas served by locally constructed&#13;
village tanks. During 1951, the erstwhile Govemment of Hyderabad submitted a scheme to the GOI&#13;
Planning Commission based on a dam at Pochampad on the Godavari River and dams on its&#13;
tributaries, the Kaddam and Mannair rivers. The Pochampad site was located a little below the entry&#13;
point of the Godavari River into AP territory. However, only the Kaddam Dam was built. The final&#13;
Pochampad Project proposals were cleared for GOAP in 1964 and were based on utilization of 66&#13;
TMC of Godavari waters stored in a 112 TMC gross capacity Pochampad Dam (82.1 TMC live&#13;
storage) to irrigate 231,000 ha via a 113 km long Kakatiya Canal (KKC). The dam was also to&#13;
include a hydroelectric generating plant with a 36 MW installed capacity. Bank involvement began&#13;
in 1971 with assistance to GOAP for completing the Pochmapad Dam--later renamed Sriramasagar&#13;
Reservoir (SRSR)--and extension of the existing 17,000 ha command area to 100,000 ha. When&#13;
detailed localization surveys revealed that a CCA of 0.231 M ha was not available up to km 113 of&#13;
KKC, plans were made to: (a) extend KKC another 33 km up to the Mannair River; (b) construct the&#13;
13.4 TMC capacity Lower Mannair Dam (LMD) as a balancing reservoir; and (c) extend the&#13;
command area beyond KKC's proposed km 146.&#13;
14.   Command Area Development. The Pochampad Project became known as SRSP when it&#13;
was reformulated in 1982-1984 to increase the command area from 0.231 M ha to 0.392 M ha by: (a)&#13;
extending KKC to km 284 to create a 343,000 ha command, and supplying water to Warangal town&#13;
at KKC's km 234; and (b) including two new canals from SSR: Saraswathi Canal to potentially serve&#13;
17,000 ha and linking SRSR to Kaddam reservoir; and Laxmi Canal to serve 6,400 ha (see Figure 2).&#13;
KKC was also to be lined to reduce losses and GOAP adopted a water management and system&#13;
design policy based on Rotational Water Supply and de-localization of the whole area for ID&#13;
irrigation only. The extension of KKC to km 146 LMD and the new Laxmi and Saraswathi canals&#13;
were funded by GOAP, while command area development of 33,500 ha was to be undertaken under&#13;
the bank-supported AP I project. AP I had implementation problems, and after restructuring, all&#13;
field channels and on farm works were eliminated.&#13;
15.   Thus by 1985, prior to the AP II appraisal, only about 120,000 ha of the main network out of&#13;
total CCA of 164,800 ha above LMD had been completed (except for channel lining) but the minor&#13;
network was not completed. Nevertheless, GOAP began to extend KKC below LMD until km 234.&#13;
Under AP II, the KKC works up to km 234 were to be completed and extended to km 284 to create a&#13;
command of 163,000 ha below LMD. Thus the total area served by KKC was expected to be&#13;
328,000 ha and serve over 651 villages. Rehabilitation of the existing command area above LMD&#13;
was an important AP II project component. In 1985/86 the net area irrigated by KKC was only&#13;
31,564 ha as the minor network was incomplete. During AP II, the net area irrigated rose to a&#13;
maximum of 73,447 ha in 1990/91 (inclusive of an extension of about 8000 ha below LMD complete&#13;
by 1989), and declined to 63,345 ha in 1992/93. This negative trend indicates that only a small part&#13;
of the minor canal networks were ever completed, and then deteriorated rapidly within a few years&#13;
after completion due to inadequate maintenance funding (about 85 to 90% of the O&amp;M budget is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 5 of 19&#13;
spent on establishment costs and salaries). By the closure of AP II in June 1994, no existing&#13;
command above or below LMD was rehabilitated nor were any of the new command areas&#13;
completed except for some of the distributary and branch canals.&#13;
16.   Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal. The Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal (GWDT) made&#13;
a water allocation to each riparian state after an analysis of the hydrology of the entire Godavari River&#13;
Basin. The 75% dependable yield of the Godavari River Basin at the Dowleshwaram gauging station&#13;
on the lower Godavari River was assessed by the GWDT to be 3,000 TMC (84,951 Mm ) of which&#13;
1,172 TMC (33,168 Mm3) was allocated to AP. Although specific GWDT allocations are made for&#13;
each basin there is not the same degree of project definition that occurs in the KWDT Award. As per&#13;
GWDT, AP is entitled to use all water reaching its territory including that reaching SRSR. Upstream&#13;
of SRSR, the following provisions of the GWDT agreements apply:&#13;
*  Three existing dams upstream of SRSR (Jaikwadi and Sidheswar in Maharashtra and Nizamsagar&#13;
within AP) are able to trap all flows of the catchment upstream of them, leaving an effective&#13;
catchment of 40,415 km for the SRS reservoir.&#13;
*  Agreements (as stated by GWDT) provide for 98 TMC (2775 Mm3) to be allocated to schemes in&#13;
the upstream effective catchment area.&#13;
*  There is no specific water allocation for SRSP except that the project will get any water left over&#13;
after upstream utilisation of 98 TMC (2775 Mm3) (i.e. any determination of the amount of water&#13;
available to SRSP must be reduced by 98 TMC to allow for future development).&#13;
GOAP entered into a bilateral agreement with the state of Maharashtra in 1975 and filed a document&#13;
which became part of the GWDT Award. According to this document, a quantity of 200 TMC (5,660&#13;
Mm3) is accepted as available at the Maharashtra border for flow into SRSR and served as the basis of&#13;
GOAP planning of SRSP in 1982/84 (para.16). In contrast to the KWDT provisions, no expiry date&#13;
was set for the GWDT Award.&#13;
17.   SRSP Water Availability Estimates The AP II Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) estimated the&#13;
75% dependable inflow to SRSR to be 160 TMC according toCWC computations. Adding an&#13;
estimated 13.4 TMC as the 75% dependable inflow into LMD, the total 75% water availability for&#13;
the SRSP scheme was regarded by the Bank to be 177.4 TMC. The SAR assumed that the&#13;
requirements of Laxmi, Saraswathi and KKC (up to km 284) commands would be 121.6 TMC and&#13;
the balance amount of 56 TMC was therefore assumed to be available for irrigation beyond km 284&#13;
of KKC. The AP II SAR based its assessment on a canal irrigation efficiency of 50%, but noted that,&#13;
if irrigation efficiency was realistically only 3 7%, scheme expansion below KKC 's km 284 would not&#13;
be possible. In 1992, the CWC re-estimated the 75% dependable inflow to SRSR to be 196.1 TMC&#13;
(after subtraction of 98 TMC for future developments upstream). Accordingly, GOAP undertook a&#13;
water supply reliability simulation study of the SRSP scheme and published a report in 1993 to&#13;
expand the scope of the KKC command by 198,300 ha beyond the 328,000 ha envisaged under AP&#13;
II. The overall scheme irrigation efficiency assumed in these GOAP studies was 70%.&#13;
18.    SRSP Project Preparation Issues. When project preparation began in May 1994, GOAP&#13;
expected that the AP II program of rehabilitation and extension of 328,000 ha of SRSP would be&#13;
completed, and that the command area beyond km 284 of KKC would be extended by 34,300 ha. The&#13;
initial Bank preparation missions were concerned that these plans were optimistic because: (a) estimates&#13;
of the Godavari River inflow to SRSR seemed uncertain; (b) there were indications that sedimentation&#13;
rates of SRSR were higher than originally assumed; (c) improvement of the project's low irrigation&#13;
efficiency would be a difficult social engineering task; and (d) planning based on canal irrigation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 6 of 19&#13;
efficiencies of over 40% was unrealistic. The Bank therefore indicated that it would only support&#13;
scheme rehabilitation up to km 234 of KKC and not support completion of the works to expand the&#13;
SRSP command beyond km 234 as it feared that water supply reliability beyond this point would be&#13;
low because of the above reasons. In order to resolve the issue of supply reliability, it was agreed that&#13;
GOAP would therefore review both the hydrology of inflows into SRSP and its SRSP simulation model&#13;
to (i) study water supply reliability below LMD, and (ii) determine the system's sensitivity to key&#13;
planning assumptions and parameters including Godavari River flow estimates. The outcome of&#13;
GOAP's simulation studies--described herein--confirmed the Bank's concerns: consequently, the&#13;
proposed project only supports rehabilitation of the existing command up to km 234 of KKC. The&#13;
project does however support an economic rehabilitation program for families affected by land&#13;
acquisition for the SRSP extension works undertaken under AP II.&#13;
B. Hydrological Series Used for Simulation Studies&#13;
Krishna River Basin&#13;
19.   Inflow into Srisailam Reservoir. The KWDT established and published a Krishna River flow&#13;
series for the period 1894/95 to 1971/72 consisting of the annual mean flows at the Vijayawada gauging&#13;
station near Prakasam Barrage in the Coastal Region of AP (see Figure 1). To this was added the yearly&#13;
estimate of water use upstream of Vijayawada obtained by consensus from the three Riparian States&#13;
(Maharastra, Kamataka and Andhra Pradesh). The resultant annual flows can be considered as a best&#13;
estimate of the 'natural' or 'virgin' flow record of the Krishna from its origin to the coast. The 75%&#13;
dependable annual flow of 2060 TMC upon which the KWDT Award is based was derived from this&#13;
data series. For reasons of data integrity, only data for 1900/01 to 1971/72 was used in the project&#13;
simulation study. In order to derive a hydrological series representing the gross water yield at the&#13;
Srisailam Reservoir for use in the simulation study, the flows at the downstream Vijayawada gauging&#13;
station (Figure 1) were multiplied by a factor of 0.9123 derived from gauging station and catchment&#13;
area correlation. The net inflow series at Srisailam Reservoir was obtained by first deducting upstream&#13;
water allocations made by KWDT, and then by adding 11 TMC (311 Mm3) regeneration flow and the&#13;
water saving of 8 TMC (227 Mm3) expected from the KC Canal rehabilitation program (para. 7).&#13;
20.    Free Catchment Inflows. The simulation model undertakes a fortnightly routing of the series&#13;
of modelled inflows into Srisailam Reservoir. According to the reservoir's operating rules, computed&#13;
releases through the power plant and spillway are routed downstream to the Nagarjunasagar Reservoir&#13;
(NSR). The yield of the free catchment between the two reservoirs is considered while carrying out the&#13;
reservoir operation of NSR to meet its water demand. Simulated releases from NSR flow down the&#13;
Krishna to Prakasam Barrage (PB) and is augmented by yield of the free catchment between the two&#13;
structures. This yield estimate is computed by a procedure proposed by CWC in 1986. From this yield,&#13;
the inflow of the upper interim catchment (para. 19) is deducted along with the utilisation of all&#13;
schemes between NSR and PB to give the gross yield of the lower catchment. The net annual flow&#13;
series is then computed by deducting the water allocations of all schemes between NSR and PB&#13;
Godavari River Basin&#13;
21.    Generation of the SRSR Inflow Series. Prediction of water supply reliability for SRSP under&#13;
alternative development scenarios requires the derivation of a net monthly inflow series that reflects&#13;
development of the whole upper catchment of the Godavari River according to the provisions of the&#13;
GWDT. Because of very large inflows downstream of the SRSR, it is not easy to correlate the short&#13;
record of SRSR inflows and the long record of downstream flows at the Dowleshwaram gauging station&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 7 of 19&#13;
in the Coastal Region of AP. For this reason, the methodology of derivation of a reliable hydrological&#13;
series comparable to that of Krishna Basin was not possible. Instead an inflow data series for SRSR&#13;
from 1971/72 to 1986/87 was used by GOAP and extended by means of rainfall-runoff data correlation&#13;
as per a procedure developed by CWC in 1992 (para SS). Estimated utilisation for the 40515 km2 free&#13;
(effective) catchment, for each year were added to the SRSR inflow series to get gross flow. This&#13;
record was correlated with the monsoon period weighted average rainfall downstream of the three dams&#13;
which capture all the water above SRSR (Nizamsagar in AP, Jaikwadi and Sidheswar in Maharashtra).&#13;
The resulting regression equation was then used to extend the flow series back to 1950/51 based on&#13;
rainfall data. The next step was to deduct spill flows from the Nizamsagar Dam. To derive total annual&#13;
flows for the extended record based on rainfall data, it was assumed that the monsoon period flow&#13;
amount could be multiplied by 10%. Calculations have been made on the basis that the Jaikwadi and&#13;
Siddeswar dams did not spill in the 1971/72 to 1986/87 period. The gross 755 dependable yield was&#13;
computed to be 284.68 TMC. Committed and contemplated utilisation of 98 TMC (2,775 Mm3) was&#13;
deducted (para. 18) from the extended gross annual yield series series to obtain the net annual inflow&#13;
series to Sriramasagar Reservoir for the period 1950-1987 which was to be used in the simulation&#13;
model. The 75% dependable net SRSR inflow worked out as 196.1 TMC (5,553 Mm3).&#13;
22.    Alternative SRSR Inflow Series. The Bank missions determined that there were uncertainties&#13;
in the rainfall-runoff correlation used to extend the 1971-1987 SRSR inflow data record. It also found&#13;
that there were apparently non-random trends in the data used in GOAP's correlation studies. GOAP&#13;
were therefore asked to consider the alternatives to its flow generation methodology. The various&#13;
estimates of the net 75% dependable inflow into SRSR that emerged from the alternative&#13;
methodologies is shown in Table 1 below.&#13;

a/ Figures in parentheses are Mm,&#13;
The alternatives considered were: (a) use of data from upstream CWC gauging stations (Basar,&#13;
Mancharial,Yelli) in the 'free' catchment above SRSR to produce an inflow series; (b) extend the&#13;
derived 1950-1987 inflow series to 1994 using available SRSR data; and (c) compile an alternative&#13;
series for SRSP based on Nizamsagar Dam inflows for the period 1950-51 to 1989-90. The purpose of&#13;
these altemative computations was to determine whether the streamflow generation procedure used by&#13;
GOAP was robust. The Bank's consultant hydrologist (FAO) also undertook an independent evaluation&#13;
by using: (i) 28 years of daily streamflow data of upstream gauging stations and correlation with SRSR&#13;
inflows; and (ii) correlation with Nizamsagar dam inflows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 8 of 19&#13;
23.    GOAP prefers its standard inflow series giving a 75% dependable SRSR inflow estimate of&#13;
196.1 TMC (Table 1, column 1) and regard the other alternatives (Table 1, columns 2 &amp; 3) as upper and&#13;
lower limits within the range of statistical error. Thus the standard 1950-1987 series is used in GOAP&#13;
simulation studies . The inflow series preferred by the Bank/FAO is the Nizamsagar Dam series (Table&#13;
1, column 5). This series has been used in some simulation modelling runs to provide an alternative&#13;
estimate of scheme reliability (Table 6).&#13;
24.    Total Surface Water Availability. Water for the Kakatiya Canal is obtained from the Lower&#13;
Mannair Dam (LMD) as well as SRSR. No processed discharge data (aside of a 4 year record) exists&#13;
for LMD: thus flows have been derived by correlation with actual records for the nearby Kaddam&#13;
Reservoir using rainfall-runoff relationships and the free catchment area between Upper and Lower&#13;
Mannair dams on the Mannair River. The 75% dependable annual inflow to LMD is calculated by&#13;
GOAP as 12.4 TMC (351 Mm3). The 75% dependable water availability for the overall scheme is&#13;
shown in Table 1 for alternative SRSR inflow estimates and a constant average monthly series is used&#13;
for LMD inflow in the SRSP simulation model.&#13;
C. Simulation Framework&#13;
Srisailam Reservoir Operation Model&#13;
25.    Simulation Model Components. The simulation model to determine how the 65,000 ha&#13;
SRBC command will succeed in competition with existing and future irrigation, hydroelectric and&#13;
water supply schemes, entailed definition of detailed reservoir and scheme operating rules, and scheme&#13;
water requirements. Thus, ongoing schemes (SRBC and TGP) and future projects (SLBC and&#13;
Hyderabad water supply augmentation) are regarded as being commissioned. The schemes included in&#13;
the model are shown in Figure 1. Upstream of Srisailam Reservoir, water is diverted to the Jurala and&#13;
KC Canal irrigation schemes. Water would be supplied from Srisailam Reservoir to the two power&#13;
stations, three new irrigation schemes (SRBC, TGP and SLBC) and the downstream existing irrigation&#13;
schemes. Tributary rivers below Srisailam Reservoir contribute water to the existing and proposed&#13;
downstream water demands. In addition to water and power, water supply for Madras is to be diverted&#13;
from the Srisailam Reservoir according to interstate agreements (para. 6), while Hyderabad supplies are&#13;
to be abstracted from the Nagarjunasagar Reservoir.&#13;
26.    Krishna Model Characteristics. A detailed simulation model was developed by ICADD that&#13;
took account of seasonal crop water demand, estimated reservoir evaporation losses, hydropower flow&#13;
requirements, reservoir operating rules and scheme supply priorities according to GOAP policy.&#13;
Fortnightly steps were used to obtain the basic scheme performance data used to for evaluation of&#13;
model performance. GOAP's priorities for water release at the Srisailam Reservoir were based on&#13;
ensuring urban water supply first, then meeting demand of existing schemes and firm power generation&#13;
commitments, followed by SRBC's allocation and lastly, new surplus water irrigation schemes. The&#13;
priorities are therefore: (i) Madras Water Supply; (ii) Nagarjunasagar and Prakasam Barrage irrigation&#13;
together with Hyderabad water supply augmentation and firm power commitments of Srisailam&#13;
Reservoir; (iii) SRBC irrigation; (iv) filling of Owk Reservoir; (v) Telegu Ganga Project; and (vi)&#13;
SLBC Project. The model's scheme and reservoir operating rules based on the above priorities are&#13;
quite complex and are related to reservoir storage levels. These rules are fully detailed in ICADD's&#13;
simulation study reportI. Detailed crop water demands that vary with seasonal climatic conditions are&#13;

modelled. Estimates of total fortnightly reservoir evaporation losses are deducted from all reservoirs in&#13;
the model.&#13;
27.    Analysis of Development Options and Scheme Performance. The principal development&#13;
options analysed to assess SRBC water supply reliability included: (a) inclusion or exclusion of the&#13;
Gorakullu Reservoir; (b) a reduced capacity Owk Reservoir; (c) impact of non-realisation of 8 TMC per&#13;
year water savings from rehabilitation of the KC Canal scheme; and (d) development of the SRBC&#13;
command area to 77,000 ha instead of 65,000 ha as proposed under AP II and AP III. Supply reliability&#13;
of each scheme was expressed as a percentage of the number of modelled years that modelled supply&#13;
fell short of its fortnightly water demand in any period. For irrigation projects, an the definition of&#13;
success included acceptance of cumulative annual shortfalls of 0.3-0.4 TMC. The total annual power&#13;
output for each hydroelectric plant was also computed to determine shortfalls created by alternative&#13;
development options.&#13;
28.    Reservoir Operating Levels.  In particular, the system  performance sensitivity to an&#13;
alternative Srisailam MDDL was modelled given the current tendency to draw down the reservoir in the&#13;
dry season in order to maximize power output. When the reservoir becomes a multi-purpose facility in&#13;
the future, such drawdown could cause late filling of the reservoir and delay or affect diversions for&#13;
Madras, SRBC and TGP.&#13;
29.    Reservoir Sedimentation Scenarios.  Various reservoir sedimentation scenarios were&#13;
modelled to determine the sensitivity of supply reliability and sustainability to loss of reservoir live&#13;
storage. The base case assumes reservoir live storage decreased by 50 years of sedimentation. Since&#13;
the Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar reservoirs were completed in the late 1 970s, this modelling&#13;
assumption simulates available storage during the economic lifetime of SRBC (i.e. the next 30 years).&#13;
Considerable analytical effort was devoted to establishing reservoir sedimentation volumes after 50&#13;
years of operation as only one reservoir survey undertaken in the early 1 980s is available. Calculations&#13;
are based on upstream river sediment gauging station data and on actual sedimentation rates for the&#13;
upstream Tungabadhra Reservoir (in Kamataka) over a 30 year period. As a result of the focus A series&#13;
of cross sections have been established at the Srisailam Reservoir so that sedimentation can be&#13;
systematically monitored once every five years as required by national guideleines.&#13;
30.   Irrigation Efficiency Planning Assumptions. A sensitivity test based on a range of irrigation&#13;
efficiencies from 56% to 40% have been modelled to determine water supply reliability to this key&#13;
parameter. ICADD optimistically selected a 56% irrigation efficiency in its SRBC planning studies&#13;
whereas Bank missions consider 40% to be a reasonable planning assumption.&#13;
31.    Sensitivity to Hydrological Series Length. The KWDT Krishna River flow series used&#13;
enables simulation of 87 years of scheme performance. Actual Srisailam inflows for the period 1972 to&#13;
1993 were added to this series in order to extend the modelling period and test sensitivity to series&#13;
length. However, this comparison is only an indicative one as data on actual abstractions by upstream&#13;
riparian states are not available to AP for post-KWDT period.  Accordingly, natural inflow is&#13;
approximated by adding KWDT sanctioned water allocations to existing upstream riparian schemes.&#13;

The SRSP simulation model includes two reservoirs (SRSR, LMD) and four irrigation commands.&#13;
These commands are Laxmi Canal, Saraswathi Canal, SRS irrigation (Kakatiya Canal above LMD up&#13;
to km 146) and LMD irrigation (Kakatiya Canal from LMD up to km 234 or up to km 284). The model&#13;
also considers the impact of the proposed Korutla Flood Flow Scheme to divert monsoon flood flows&#13;
from SRSR into a detention reservoir at Korutla via a canal instead of discharging floods downstream.&#13;
This scheme would operate once the SRSR water level reaches the reservoir Flood Release Level (FRL)&#13;
at elevation 1,091 feet.&#13;
33.    Water Delivery Priorities.  Water delivery priorities are placed within the context of&#13;
integrated operating rules for a range of water levels in each reservoir. These priorities are:&#13;
(i)    Water supply to the NTPC thermal power station from SRSR and urban water&#13;
supply from to LMD to Warangal and Karamnigar;&#13;
(ii)   Irrigation requirements for above LMD (from SRSR);&#13;
(iii)   Augmentation of to LMD storage from SRSR; and&#13;
(iv)   Irrigation below LMD from LMD storage.&#13;

Hydroelectric power is generated only when water is released into KKC from SRSR.&#13;
34.    Variation of Reservoir Operating Levels. The design operating levels for the two project&#13;
reservoirs are:&#13;
Sriramasagar Reservior&#13;
FRL (flood release level)                332.54 m (1,091 ft)&#13;
MDDL (minimum drawdown level)            322.48 m (1,058 ft)&#13;
Lower Mannair Dam&#13;
FRL (flood release level)                280.42 m (920.00 ft)&#13;
MDDL (minimum drawdown level)            275.85 m (905.00 ft)&#13;
The sensitivity of water supply perfornance to the SRSR MDDL was considered by running the model&#13;
with a SRSR MDDL of 1,034 ft (i.e. running the risk of a delay in filling the reservoir in the subsequent&#13;
monsoon season and thus possibly delaying the initiation of irrigation above LMD).&#13;
35.    LMD Storage Management Procedure.  Provision was made to review the balancing&#13;
capacity of LMD as a storage facility for surplus Godavari River inflow into SRSR and seasonal&#13;
irrigation below LMD. Under normal model conditions, LMD's reservoir is maintained at or near FRL&#13;
by releasing water from SRSR and conveying it to LMD provided all irrigation demands of KKC above&#13;
LMD can be met and canal conveyance capacity is adequate (para.4 1). Thus a series of simulation runs&#13;
were made whereby water is only released to LMD from SRSR when LMD levels are below its FRL&#13;
reservoir capacity.&#13;
36.   KKC Conveyance Capacity. The Kakatiya Canal's original design capacity up to km 146&#13;
was 8,500 cusecs (240.7 cumecs) but its current capacity is about 5,000 cusecs because of bed siltation&#13;
and broken lining. The project would increase the KKC cross-section to a capacity to 9,000 cusecs in&#13;
order to improve delivery of Godavari floodwater (which would otherwise spill from SRSR) to LMD&#13;
for seasonal storage. The simulation model uses existing and proposed KKC conveyance capacity to&#13;
determine the impact of the proposed capacity increase on SRSP water supply reliability and to model&#13;
its current restricted operational status.&#13;
37.    Sensitivity to Planning Uncertainties. Planning parameters were varied as in the Krishna&#13;
Basin model. Variations used in the model sensitivity analysis runs included: (a) higher than planned&#13;
water use in the command above LMD (b) water demand estimates computed by an altemative method;&#13;
(c) smaller water diversions in upstream riparian states; (d) use of the less bountiful SRSR inflow series&#13;
derived by FAO; and (e) alternative canal irrigation efficiency estimates.&#13;
38.    Sensitivity to Canal Irrigation Efficiency Estimates. The canal irrigation efficiency of&#13;
SRSP is low. The net area of 63,645 ha irrigated in 1992/93 (mainly for rice) utilized about 95 TMC&#13;
(i.e. about 85% of the project water allocation of 113 TMC planned to be used on 328,000 ha) with a&#13;
cropping intensity of about 112% (the project area cropping intensity is higher due to well and tank&#13;
irrigation). The 1992/93 gross water use is equivalent to an annual gross water application of about&#13;
3,773 mm of water per ha or about 6.6 times the GOAP's planned water duty of 572 mm/year/ha for&#13;
SRSP as a whole. The large apparent water use means that irrigation consisted of continuous flow&#13;
through rice paddies, with about one third of the residual flowing into village irrigation tanks to&#13;
supplement their rice cultivation, and about two thirds flowing into watercourses discharging into the&#13;
Godavari River and recharging the aquifer (and partly recycled by well irrigation to increase the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 12 of 19&#13;
overall irrigation efficiency of the command). Part of the problem stems from: (a) allowing rice&#13;
farmers to use water indiscriminately in the early years of project development; (b) the deficient&#13;
design of SRSP whereby--in many instances--water is directly supplied from a large canal to small&#13;
irrigation blocks through oversized outlets. Although design deficiencies are to be corrected under&#13;
the project, water supply to the below LMD command is dependent of the irrigation efficiency&#13;
achieved above LMD.&#13;
39.    Sensitivity to SRSR Sedimentation Rates. In order to derive a conservative estimate of&#13;
supply reliability, the simulation model was run using SRSR and LMD storage capacity reductions&#13;
equivalent to 50 years of sedimentation at a design catchment erosion rate of 1.2 acre-feet/sq. mile/year.&#13;
Accordingly, based on computations and revision of the reservoir area-capacity curve, the modelled&#13;
storage capacity for SRSR after 50 years of sedimentation was taken as 77 TMC at its FRL elevation&#13;
(instead of its initial capacity of 112 TMC). The sensitivity of scheme water supply reliability was also&#13;
tested by running the model using a SRSR capacity of 60 TMC, i.e. a forecast of residual storage after&#13;
75 years of sedimentation. The need for this sensitivity analysis arose out of the Bank's concern that&#13;
the design sedimentation rate may be too low when compared to the rate implied by analysis of the only&#13;
available 1984 reservoir hydrographic survey (i.e. at the time the SRSR spillway gates were installed).&#13;
Hence, particular importance was given to the issue of model sensitivity to reservoir sedimentation in&#13;
that it could affect water supply reliability in the later years of the project's economic life. Since GOAP&#13;
claimed that there were errors in its 1984 survey because too few reservoir cross-sections were used, it&#13;
commissioned the AP Engineering Research Laboratory to undertake an additional hydrographic survey&#13;
in 1994.&#13;
40.    The 1994 reservoir survey report concluded that SRSR storage capacity had reduced from 112&#13;
TMC to 90.3 TMC over a 24 year period, and its analysis implied an average annual sedimentation rate&#13;
of 1.0 acre-feet/sq. mile of free catchment/year. However, at appraisal in 1996, GOAP informed the&#13;
Bank that the original topographic survey used to derive SRSR's initial storage capacity of 112 TMC,&#13;
was found to be erroneous. Revised calculations indicated that the reservoir's initial volume was most&#13;
likely about 98.8 TMC. This meant that SRSR's 50 year volume was recomputed as 81 TMC. Since&#13;
this result is similar to the volume of 77 TMC used in modelling studies, GOAP saw no need to&#13;
undertake further model sensitivity tests. However, an independent analysis by the appraisal mission&#13;
hydrologist indicated that extrapolation of the 1994 survey results and the smaller initial capacity of&#13;
SRSR that the 50 year SRSR capacity could be as low as 67 TMC, i.e. almost the 75 year residual&#13;
storage value used by GOAP in its model. Thus particular attention is given to SRSR sedimentation in&#13;
the interpretation of model results and to execution of the SRSR catchment treatment plan included in&#13;
the proposed project's Environmental Management Plan component.&#13;
D. Krishna River Basin Model Results&#13;
Performance of Krishna River Basin Schemes&#13;
41.    Basin Performance. The success of the SRBC project in achieving 75% dependable water&#13;
supply (scheme success) was evaluated using the simulation model for the Krishna Basin. The standard&#13;
simulation case results indicate that--under full development without Gorakullu Reservoir--all schemes&#13;
modelled succeeded in achieving an acceptable requisite water supply reliability or power output (see&#13;
Table 3 below). Acceptability was defined as a reliability of 75% for irrigation schemes and over 95-&#13;
98% for urban water supply.&#13;

42.    SRBC is too small to affect existing schemes within the AP portion of the Krisha Basin. If&#13;
SRBC were not included in the basin development program, then average power output increases from&#13;
2390 GWh to 2435 GWh.: i.e., an additional 45 Million KWh of power is generated each year (1.9%&#13;
more). Model runs for the case without the SBRC scheme are not available, but a study that considered&#13;
the effect of not supplying the 8 TMC KC canal leakage water suggests that success rates would&#13;
increase in the order of 1% to about 5% for other schemes and uses.&#13;
43.    Implementation of Srisailam Reservoir Operating Rules. There is a risk that reservoir&#13;
operating rules will be breached in times of power shortages to the disadvantage of SRBC. For this&#13;
reason--and based on simulation model results--a Government Order has been issued which establishes&#13;
the reservoir MDDL at 834 feet and institutionalises the successful operating rules simulated in the&#13;
model. A Government Order has also been issued to reconstitute the Inter-Agency Committee for&#13;
Integrated Operation of the Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar Reservoirs into a standing "Committee for&#13;
Integrated Operation of Krishna and Pennar Basin Schemes" which is to meet seasonally to consider&#13;
water releases for multi-purpose uses for all schemes dependent on the Krishna River. Under these&#13;
Orders, (i) GOAP scheme water allocation priorities are preserved and non-firm hydroelectric power&#13;
generation at Srisailam is kept subservient to SRBC irrigation requirements and (ii), specific uniform&#13;
multi-purpose operating tables are to be derived for Srisailam Reservoir's power and irrigation&#13;
operation staff.&#13;
SRBC Water Supply Reliability Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
44.    Base Case Scenario. The SRBC success rate of 77.5% (Table 3) is 2.5% more than required&#13;
although it should be noted that this result is based on considering an delivery shortfall of 0.3 TMC (i.e.&#13;
less than 2% of crop demand) as a success. The base case modelled by GOAP is based on the following&#13;
key parameters: Srisailam Reservoir MDDL of 834 feet and reservoir capacity after 50 years of&#13;
sedimentation, irrigation efficiency of 56%, a 77,000 ha SRBC command area and no Gorakullu&#13;
Reservoir. The sensitivity analysis examined the impact of these key planning parameters.&#13;
45.    SRBC Sensitivity Analysis.  Sedimentation of the Srisailam Reservoir does not seem to&#13;
present a problem. Reducing the command area from almost 77,000 ha to 65,000 ha as planned for the&#13;
proposed project improved success by about 3% while adding the Gorakallu off-channel reservoir&#13;
improves scheme reliability by only 6%. In contrast, changing the MDDL to 796 feet (242.62 m)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 14 of 19&#13;
instead of limiting drawdown to the design MDDL of 834 feet (254.20 m) produces an unacceptable&#13;
result in that the supply reliability drops to about 40-45%. If the reservoir is drawn down to an&#13;
elevation of 796 feet regularly (as it is at present for hydroelectric power generation) and not kept above&#13;
834 feet, then not only does the scheme fail year by year but the onset of the irrigation season would&#13;
sometimes be delayed. With only a small amount of off river storage at Owk Resevoir, there is total&#13;
reliance on the Srisailam reservoir for early supply. The Gorakallu Reservoir could provide some&#13;
seasonal flexibility but its cost-effectiveness is very much in doubt.&#13;
46.    Rabi season irrigation reliability is not seen as a problem provided the scheme is operated&#13;
according to the modelled water allocations. Using a realistic 40% scheme irrigation efficiency reduces&#13;
supply reliability to about 73% for the base case: however this is not of major concern because of the&#13;
command area has been reduced to 65,000 ha in the project design.&#13;
47.    Adherence to supply priorities according to the Srisailam Reservoir's proposed operating rules&#13;
is important because of the relatively high level of the SRBC canal intake level of 854 feet (260.30 m).&#13;
Priority of supply over TGP and SLBC is important to SRBC as shown by the model. If SLBC or TGP&#13;
get priority over SRBC outside their limited reservoir operating range (875 to 885 feet), then it is likely&#13;
that such a practice would not only affect SRBC performance but it would cause a delay in initiating&#13;
SRBC's irrigation season. If model scenarios and operating rules are adhered to, then the absence of&#13;
KC Canal water savings (8 TMC) is not a significant factor.&#13;
Appraisal Mission Assessment&#13;
48.    The findings of the GOAP Krishna Basin simulation model are sufficiently convincing that&#13;
water availability and supply reliability should not present unacceptable planning and operational risks&#13;
that could compromise the viability of the SRBC project design during its economic life. The model&#13;
evaluated scheme performance under conditions of full river basin development as sanctioned by the&#13;
KWDT, more realistic irrigation efficiency assumptions and allows for reduction in Srisailam&#13;
Reservoir's flow regulation capacity due to unavoidable sedimentation. The project design to be&#13;
completed under the proposed AP III project in itself includes: (a) a smaller command area to be served&#13;
by the original water allocation; (b) an a priori decision to ration water by Rotational Water Supply&#13;
under an "Irrigated Dry" localization; (c) some off-channel storage in the form of Owk Reservoir; and&#13;
(d) specific operating rules and formalized management arrangements for Srisailam Reservoir which&#13;
preserve SRBC and other irrigation interests.&#13;
49.    According to a formalized GOAP water allocation policy, SRBC is accorded a higher supply&#13;
priority than TGP (currently in the early stages of construction) and SLBC (whose construction has&#13;
hardly begun). Thus, if AP's surplus monsoon water use sanction is revoked by reconvening the&#13;
KWDT in the near future in favor of greater development by upstream riparian states, AP may still&#13;
adjust the water allocation to its uncompleted projects to meet SRBC needs.&#13;
E. Sriramasagar Project Model Results&#13;
GOAP Standard Scenario Outcome&#13;
50.   Irrigation. The water supply reliability of SRSP was evaluated by simulation in the same&#13;
manner as SRBC. GOAP's standard simulation scenario was based on the following key parameters: a&#13;
flow series having a 75% dependable flow of 196 TMC; a SRSR MDDL of 858 feet and a storage&#13;
capacity reduced to 77 TMC after 50 years of sedimentation; an assumed scheme irrigation efficiency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 15 of 19&#13;
of 56%; irrigation below LMD up to km 284 of Kakatiya Canal; and a KKC capacity above LMD of&#13;
9,700 cusecs. The standard case gave a reliability of 85.4% for water delivery to the command above&#13;
LMD and 87.8% for the command below LMD: i.e., 10% to 12% more than the 75% reliability&#13;
required.&#13;
51.    Increasing the capacity of Kakatiya Canal is critical. If the Kakatiya canal is limited to 5000&#13;
cusecs and not 9,700 cusecs then none of the 41 years modelled meets irrigation demand below LMD&#13;
(0% success). It is clear that increasing KKC capacity as proposed is necessary to fill LMD reservoir&#13;
and maintain 75% dependable flow below LMD. It was also found that if KKC is not used to divert&#13;
water from SRSR whenever LMD falls to below 90% of its capacity, irrigation below LMD is badly&#13;
affected due to the limited storage capacity of LMD. Thus, upgrading the conveyance capacity of KKC&#13;
is essential to scheme success and is an integral part of the proposed project.&#13;
52.    A summary of the above results are given in Table 4 below.&#13;

53.    Power Generation. Power generation at SRSR is incidental to irrigation as a matter of GOAP&#13;
policy: hence GOAP will not issue an Government Order to maintain the MDDL of SRSR at 1,058 feet.&#13;
In recent times when the SRS reservoir has been drawn down to 1,032 feet (314.55 m), there has been&#13;
considerable delay in releasing water for the first irrigation. One of the factors in the delay appears to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

be that of trying as much as possible to release water via the power station which can only occur above&#13;

about 3-5% and 7-8% respectively. On the other hand, a higher water demand reduces success by about&#13;
10-12%. Assuming a canal irrigation efficiency of 56%, FAO undertook a separate analysis of crop&#13;
water demand specifically allowing for: (a) irrigation scheduling using a Rotational Water Supply&#13;
system as per the project's proposed operating modalities; and (b) supplemental irrigation only in the&#13;
monsoon season. It was found that water demand could be up to 38% lower than assumed by GOAP&#13;
for the model. It is therefore estimated that if canal irrigation efficiency were reduced to 40% in FAO&#13;
computations, overestimation of water demand may only be about 20%. This could somewhat mitigate&#13;
the model's poor result when a canal irrigation efficiency assumption of 40% is used.&#13;
55.    Operational Parameters. Operating the SRSR Reservoir to MDDL 1034 feet increases&#13;
success by about 10% although initiation of irrigation on June 1 will usually be delayed, often through&#13;
into August. The model's performance was notably insensitive to the use of the Bank/FAG flow series&#13;
which only reduced standard scenario success by 3%. The SRSR capacity capacity to regulate inflows&#13;
is somewhat sensitive to storage reductions due to sedimentation, particularly for the SRS command&#13;
above LMD; however, the 75 year sedimentation scenario which is assumed to reduce storage to 60&#13;
TMC did not reduce supply reliability below 75%. The Korutla Scheme reduced success of the&#13;
standard scenario by 6%; however, if canal irrigation efficiency is less than 56%, this scheme would&#13;
have an adverse impact on SRSP performance.&#13;
Canal and Scheme Irrigation Efficiency Impact&#13;
56.   Canal Irrigation Efficiency. The SRSP project was found to be very sensitive to canal&#13;
irrigation efficiency assumptions, particularly if the command below LMD is extended to km 284 of&#13;
KKC. An efficiency level below 45% implies an unreliable supply below 75% if the command is&#13;
extended below km 234: at 40% efficiency, the reliability of supply below LMD up to km 284 was only&#13;
2%. Modification of the project design to rehabilitate the command below LMD up to km 234 only&#13;
resulted in a water supply reliability of about 60% and 54% above and below LMD respectively. This&#13;
result does not take account of: (a) the higher overall scheme irrigation efficiency achieved at present&#13;
and in the future by conjunctive use of groundwater and recycling of canal seepage losses; and (b)&#13;
possible water savings by reducing water deliveries in the monsoon season to supplemental irrigation&#13;
only.&#13;
57.   Impact of Groundwater Conjunctive Use on Scheme Efficiency. The simulation model&#13;
does not include allowance for groundwater recharge from canal seepage and its conjunctive use. There&#13;
are about 15,000 shallow wells with pump-sets above LMD and about 13,200 below LMD up to km&#13;
234. In addition there are about 14,200 bullock powered wells (mhotes) above LMD and about 4,950&#13;
below LMD. Pumped wells irrigate about I ha of rice in the monsoon season and about 0.45 ha of rice&#13;
or dry crop in the Rabi season; mhotes irrigate about 0.33 ha of rice in the monsoon season only.&#13;
Studies by the AP Groundwater Department suggest that recharge up to KKC's km 234 would be about&#13;
80 Mm3 year which is about 3% of the canal fed water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 17 of 19&#13;
58.   Analysis of groundwater potential for the post-project situation indicate that--with energization&#13;
of mhote wells and additional pumped wells--the increment in utilisable groundwater resources above&#13;
and below LMD (up to km 234) are about 223 Mm3 and 97 Mm3 respectively. This corresponds to&#13;
about 23,000 additional wells above LMD and about 9,000 wells below LMD, or a total number of&#13;
wells above and below LMD equal to about 42,400 and 22,000 respectively. Thus about 20-25% of&#13;
each command could be served by groundwater to make up for deficiencies in supply and cater for&#13;
supplementation of water supply to rice cultivators when rotational water supply is introduced.&#13;
Accordingly, even if canal irrigation efficiency would only be 40%, overall scheme irrigation efficiency&#13;
would be close to 75% (under the conditions assumed in the simulation model.&#13;
Appraisal Mission Assessment&#13;
59.    GOAP's simulation model results indicate that the AP II investment in extension of the&#13;
command beyond km 234 of KKC was not warranted as water supply would be extremely unreliable.&#13;
Accordingly, the Bank will not support further investment in the area except for redressal of the adverse&#13;
impacts of land acquisition under AP II. Since reduction cf SRSR storage capacity from about 90&#13;
TMC at present to 77 TMC (the 50 year sedimentation value) would take at least twenty years, a canal&#13;
irrigation efficiency of 40% would be mitigated by reservoir capacity and groundwater conjunctive use&#13;
to keep overall scheme efficiency at a 75% level. Thus, investment in rehabilitation of the command&#13;
below LMD up to km 234 is regarded as a reasonable project risk by the appraisal mission.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT PLAN&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
1.    Environmental Assessment Procedure. Under India's Environmental Protection Act of&#13;
1986 administered by the GOI Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF), the potential adverse&#13;
environmental impacts of any public investment project need to be analyzed and if found to be&#13;
significant in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), they need to be addressed in an&#13;
Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The review process includes a separate GOI Ministry of&#13;
Social Welfare review of potential adverse social impacts caused by population displacement in&#13;
general and adverse impacts on members of Scheduled Castes and tribes in particular. Albeit that a&#13;
State investment project may be cleared by the GOI Planning Commission as technically and&#13;
economically viable, capital expenditure may only begin if and when MOEF issues a general letter of&#13;
clearance of the EIA and EMP. A state government is to make the necessary budget provision to&#13;
carry out the EMP and its implementation is monitored by MOEF.&#13;
2.    Potential Environmental Impacts.  Five principal types of environmental impact are&#13;
potentially of concern in the development of SRBC and rehabilitation of SRSP. These impacts are:&#13;
(a) the potential for soil waterlogging and secondary salinization due to rise of the groundwater table&#13;
as a result of canal irrigation; (b) loss of reservoir storage through sedimentation caused by&#13;
watershed degradation; (c) increase in malaria and waterborne diseases; (d) loss of forest land due to&#13;
reservoir and canal construction; and (d) adverse impact on flora and fauna as a result of construction&#13;
of irrigation canals. Separate EIA studies analyzing the above potential impacts for SRBC and SRSP&#13;
were compiled by consultants and submitted to the Bank in May 1994 as part of the initial project&#13;
feasibility study. These studies were based on existing and new surveys of soils, land use, flora and&#13;
fauna, and on specialized groundwater monitoring investigations and analysis undertaken by&#13;
GOAP's Groundwater Department.&#13;
3.    Environmental Clearances. In order to receive national environmental clearance for the&#13;
project, GOAP prepared a Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan&#13;
for both SRBC and SRSP according to national guidelines in February/March 1995. The EMPs&#13;
included normal construction impact mitigation and monitoring irrigation impact required of any&#13;
well planned irrigation scheme. Prior to according its clearance, MOEF required that the EMPs&#13;
include several natural resource and nature conservation sub-components which would benefit the&#13;
sub-project districts. These interventions are not attributable to any adverse impact caused by&#13;
irrigation per se. Details of the proposed R&amp;R Action Plan were also required. The EMPs were&#13;
cleared by MOEF in March 1996.&#13;
4.    No irreversible, diverse or complex adverse impacts were found by the MOEF review&#13;
committee in either of the sub-project command areas which would change the project's 'B'&#13;
environmental category rating accorded by the Bank. Given GOAP's obligation to carry out the&#13;
regional EMPs, they have been included as a monitorable investment under the project. A detailed&#13;
description of the project's EMP features are given below after a description of the project area and a&#13;
summary of groundwater and drainage analyses.&#13;

B. Geographical Features of the Project Areas&#13;
The Srisailam Right Branch Canal Sub-Project (SRBC)&#13;
5.    Location. The SRBC command area is located in the Kumool District of AP's Rayalaseema&#13;
Region within the Krishna River Basin and is situated along the west bank of the Kundu River, a&#13;
Krishna tributary (Map IBRD &amp;&amp;&amp;). The command area is about 130 km long and 5-10 km wide,&#13;
with a cultivable command area (CCA) of 77,000 ha (Figure 1). The area became potentially&#13;
irrigable only after completion of the Srisailam Reservoir (IBRD Map 18843) on the Krishna River&#13;
in the late 1970s. This reservoir [live storage of 250 thousand million cubic feet (TMC)] was&#13;
originally designed for power generation.&#13;
6.    Climate, Drainage and Soils. Climate is temperate with hot summers and mild winters. The&#13;
average annual rainfall is 761 mm with nearly 71% falling from July to September and the remainder&#13;
between October and December. During 1901-1993, rainfall varied between 280 mm (in 1920) to&#13;
1,070 mm (in 1970) and droughts during the monsoon are common. The command has a flat&#13;
gradient of about 1:1,000 towards the Kundu river and is drained by numerous small streams. About&#13;
80% of the command area consists of deep Black Cotton soils with 83% of the soils falling into Land&#13;
Irrigability Class II.&#13;
7.    Demography. The area has a total population of about 286,000 living in 95 villages. The&#13;
average household size is 5 people. Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) comprise&#13;
about 28% and 2% of the total population respectively, while the majority belong to the Backward&#13;
Caste (artisans, servants and laborers) and Other Caste (landed) groups. Landowners comprise about&#13;
24% of the population.&#13;
8.    Land Tenure. The average farm size is 1.8 ha whereas 2 ha of rainfed land is regarded as a&#13;
"minimum economic holding" in AP. Land holdings are unequally distributed (Table 1). Marginal&#13;
farmers and small farmers having an average holding of 0.53 ha and 1.44 ha respectively, comprise&#13;
68% of the landowners but own only 26% of the land area. The medium and large farmers&#13;
comprising only 32% of landowners, own 74% of the land and have a average farm holding of 4.85&#13;
ha. Thus the predominant cropping pattern is determined by mainly by medium and large farmers.&#13;
9.    Agricultural Development. Rainfed crops predominate in the proposed command area with&#13;
the most important cash crops being sorghum, groundnut, tobacco, sunflower, coriander, cotton and&#13;
pulses. Because they are grown under rainfed conditions, average yields are low. There are about&#13;
2,650 wells irrigating about 3,650 ha during the monsoon (kharif) season and about 2,600 ha in the&#13;
post-monsoon (rabi) season. About 2,800 ha is irrigated by 14 irrigation tanks. In contrast, within&#13;
the Kurnool District there are about 150,000 ha irrigated by the Kurnool-Cuddapah (KC) Canal&#13;
Scheme on the east bank of the Kundu, wells and tanks. Seed, fertilizer and pesticide depots are&#13;
within a reasonable distance (less than 16 km) for about two thirds of the villages. Oil mills, rice&#13;
mills and other market and processing facilities are adequate and within reasonable distance of the&#13;
command area. About 32 villages are near (less than 16 km) veterinary hospitals and livestock&#13;
service units. Agricultural credit institutions such as Scheduled Banks, Grameena Banks and&#13;
Cooperative Credit Societies are plentiful in the area.&#13;
10.   Infrastructure. The population is relatively well served by social infrastructure. There are:&#13;
19 hospitals, dispensaries and primary health care centers; and 77 primary schools and 14 high&#13;
schools. Only 18 villages have tubewells while all other villages obtain potable water from open&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 14&#13;
wells. All villages are electrified. The area is served by good road, bus and rail links to the rest of&#13;
the state and 72 villages are served by all weather feeder roads. There are post offices in 66 villages&#13;
although only 28 have telephones.&#13;
The Sriramasagar Sub-Project (SRSP)&#13;
11.   Location and Scope. The SRSP command is located in the Telengana Region of AP and&#13;
covers part of the Nizamsagar, Karimnagar and Warangal Districts (Map IBRD 18842). It is served&#13;
by the Sriramasagar Reservoir (SRSR) on the Godavari River near the Maharashtra State border. The&#13;
upper portion of the command (about 100,000 ha) served by the Kakatiya Canal (KKC) was&#13;
originally developed up to KKC's km 113 under the Bank-supported Pochampad Project. During the&#13;
late 1970s and early 1980s, GOAP extended the KKC up to km 234 near the town of Warangal to&#13;
create an irrigation potential of 323,000 ha (Figure 2). The works included construction of the&#13;
Lower Mannair Dam (LMD) across the Mannair River (a tributary of the Godavari River) at KKC's&#13;
km 146 near the town of Karimnagar. LMD augments SRSP water supply by capturing the runoff&#13;
from the Mannair River's free catchment and serve as a balancing reservoir for SRSR (i.e. to prevent&#13;
spillage of monsoon floodwaters at SRSR). The KKC and irrigation works below LMD were not&#13;
completed by GOAP when the SRSP sub-project AP II was appraised. Under the Second Andhra&#13;
Pradesh Irrigation Project, the KKC was to be completed to km 284 and its command extended by an&#13;
additional 34,000 ha.&#13;
12.   Climate Drainage and Soils. The climate is tropical with hot summers and dry winters.&#13;
The average rainfall varies from about 1,170 mm near SRSR to about 878 mm at Warangal (km 234&#13;
of KKC). There is marked inter-annual variation in rainfall and several consecutive years of drought&#13;
are not uncommon. The topography of the gross command area comprises of a series of valleys with&#13;
flat bottom lands which are separated by steep ridges and bare rock domes. The net to gross&#13;
command area ratio is therefore only about 50%. Drainage density is high and is generally northeast&#13;
to the Godavari River and streams have perennial base flows maintained by effluent discharge from&#13;
groundwater. About 60% of the command area consists of Black Cotton soils (Vertisols) while the&#13;
remainder are red Alfisols. A high clay content and relatively poor drainage is found only where&#13;
black soils overly sedimentary formations such as limestone. About 67% of the cultivable command&#13;
area is classified under Land Irrigability Class II while about 13% is classified as Class III.&#13;
13.   Population and Land Tenure.  The potential project area (587,000 ha) has a total&#13;
population is about 4.05 M, of which about 1.83 M live in the SRSP command area up to KKC's km&#13;
234. The farming population constitutes about 70%. The average holding size is 1. I ha. Marginal&#13;
farmers and small farmers having an average holding of 0.44 ha and 1.40 ha respectively, comprise&#13;
about 83% of the landowners but own 47% of the land area. The medium and large farmers&#13;
comprising 17% of landowners with an average holding of 3.8 ha.&#13;
14.    Agricultural Development. In the early 1990s, the net area irrigated by KKC was about&#13;
70,000 ha, while that irrigated by tanks and groundwater up to km 284 was about 30,000-40,000 ha&#13;
and about 90,000 ha respectively. During the kharif season, paddy is the preferred crop while pulses&#13;
are grown extensively. In the upper reaches of the command (above LMD) maize is an important&#13;
crop, while groundnut is preferred below LMD. Amongst the two-seasonal crops, large areas of&#13;
cotton and chilies are grown below LMD, while tumeric is favored above LMD. During the rabi&#13;
season, paddy followed by maize and groundnut are preferred above LMD; however, since there is&#13;
limited canal irrigation below LMD, groundnut is an important crop. The yields of irrigated crops&#13;
are above the state averages. Agricultural processing facilities for rice oil seeds and cotton are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 14&#13;
adequate. Agricultural extension is provided by the Agriculture Department as well as private&#13;
fertilizer and pesticide suppliers.&#13;
15.   Industry and Infrastructure. The region is not industrially developed and there few&#13;
industries in the command area. There are some factories based on mining and forest products. The&#13;
main mineral resource is coal the Karimnagar District and hence two thermal power stations of 62&#13;
MW and 2,100 MW installed capacity each are located there. Aside of the 27 MW hydro capacity at&#13;
SRSR, some mini-hydro plants are being built on SRSP's larger canals. All important towns and&#13;
district headquarters are connected by good all-weather roads. Under the AP II project, 45 feeder&#13;
roads with a total length of 485 km were built connecting 112 villages to state roads.&#13;
C. Groundwater Build-Up Potential&#13;
SRBC Irrigation Development Impact&#13;
16.   Groundwater Development Potential.  The SRBC command is underlain by semi-&#13;
consolidated rocks of sedimentary origin such as quartzite, shale and limestone. They have a non-&#13;
uniform fracture porosity extending about 70 m deep and groundwater is utilized by about 1,890 dug&#13;
wells and tubewells irrigating only about 3,500 ha. Their yield is highly variable depending on local&#13;
geohydrological conditions and vary from that required to irrigate 0.5 ha/well to those capable of&#13;
irrigation about 4 ha/well. The Groundwater Department has undertaken intensive groundwater&#13;
monitoring since 1991 when a network of 137 observation wells was established. Water levels are&#13;
measured during fixed 10-day periods in January, April, June, August and October, and water quality&#13;
samples are taken in April and October. Under current conditions, water levels below the ground&#13;
surface are, for most of the area, deeper than 3 m--even in the post-monsoon period. The average&#13;
water table depth in the 1993 pre-monsoon period varied from 5.6 m below ground level (b.g.l.) in&#13;
block VII to 13.0 m b.g.l. in block IV. During the post-monsoon, water table depths b.g.l. reached&#13;
3.6 m in block IV and 9.83 m in block VII. The Kundu River serves a groundwater drainage&#13;
recipient for the area.&#13;
17.   Groundwater development is not financially feasible in about 70% of the gross command&#13;
area, even with large diameter hand dug wells which are pumped intermittently because of low well&#13;
yields. Thus, even allowing for additional recharge from canal seepage, the additional full&#13;
groundwater development possible in the 65,000 ha SRBC command area is only about 5,000 ha&#13;
served by about 2,500 additional wells each abstracting about 12,000 m3/year (gross). Thus the&#13;
overall area irrigated by conjunctive use of groundwater could at the very most be about 8,500 ha or&#13;
about 13% of the net command area.&#13;
18.   Potential for Groundwater Build-up. A forecast of future groundwater build-up with and&#13;
without groundwater development was made by the Groundwater Department on the basis of&#13;
increased recharge from irrigation and canal seepage. The groundwater rise over the 16 irrigation&#13;
blocks as a consequence of estimated incremental recharge varies from about 1.8 m to 4.9 m. The&#13;
post-monsoon water levels in the SRBC command are projected to be shallow (0.0 m to 1.9 m b.g.l.)&#13;
in blocks VI, VII, XII, XIII and XVI and deep in blocks III, IV and IX. With full groundwater&#13;
development, post-monsoon water levels would be 1.38 m to 8.8 m b.g.l. so that all groundwater&#13;
levels would be below 2 m except in blocks VI and VII. This static analysis is however regarded by&#13;
Bank missions as inaccurate or overly pessimistic as it does not consider increased drainage to the&#13;
Kundu River and adjacent lower groundwater as a result of the increased groundwater gradients&#13;
caused by water table rise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 5 of 14&#13;
19.   Although all canals are lined and the scheme is based on a rotational water supply and&#13;
irrigation, prevention measures such under-drainage of canals in some of the problematic blocks has&#13;
been included in the detailed designs. While water logged pockets could occur over time, they&#13;
would not preclude rice cultivation. The nearby Mylavaram and Kurnool-Cuddapah (K.C.) Canal&#13;
schemes located in areas with similar hydrogeological, pedological and geomorphological&#13;
characteristics were analyzed as indicators of waterlogging development.  In both schemes,&#13;
groundwater build-up has not been a problem. In particular, the K.C. Canal command can be&#13;
regarded as a surrogate for SRBC command area when the latter is irrigated. The K.C. Canal&#13;
command lies on the east bank of the Kundu River and is virtually a geomorphological mirror image&#13;
of SRBC except that it has been irrigated for over one hundred years. The pre-monsoon water depths&#13;
are in the range 3-9 m b.g.l. while post-monsoon water level depths range from 1.3 m to more than&#13;
5.0 m b.g.l. and the area of water table depths &lt;2 m b.g.l. is small. There are no reports of secondary&#13;
soil salinization and crop yields are high (e.g. 5 tons/ha for paddy). Thus, the K.C. Canal scheme&#13;
indicates that serious groundwater drainage problems are not to be anticipated in SRBC.&#13;
20.   Groundwater Quality and Salinization Potential. An Electrical Conductivity (EC) map of&#13;
the SRBC command shows that most of the areas zoned for potential groundwater development have&#13;
groundwater with EC &lt;2,250 umhos/cm and some have EC &lt;750 umhos/cm. While the upper end of&#13;
this conductivity range is fairly high, farmers using groundwater do not report water quality as a&#13;
problem for cropping. Areas proposed for development around Owk Reservoir have EC values&#13;
&gt;2,250 umhos/cm. Here some farmers report problems with cultivating paddy nurseries with poor&#13;
quality groundwater, but have no problems with the transplanted crop. Leaching requirement is&#13;
estimated at 17% and can be met from field application losses. It is therefore considered that, in&#13;
general, groundwater quality is not a serious constraint in SRBC command, particularly when it can&#13;
be used conjunctively with high quality Krishna water which has an EC of less than 500 umhos/cm.&#13;
Furthermore, as in the nearby Mylavaram scheme, recharge will tend to improve groundwater&#13;
quality. Alkaline hazard is also not anticipated as the Sodium Adsorption Ratio of both surface and&#13;
groundwater is generally less than 4.&#13;
SRSP Irrigation Development Impact&#13;
21.   Hydrogeology and Well Yields.  Groundwater generally occurs under water-table&#13;
conditions. Large diameter dug-wells are the most common means of its abstraction although dug-&#13;
cum-tubewells are also found. The potential of the aquifers is generally limited. The yield of dug-&#13;
wells varies from 40-150 m3/day in consolidated rocks, 25-100 m3/hour with a 1.5-30 m drawdown&#13;
in semi-consolidated rocks, and about 90-180 m3/hour in alluvium along the Godavari river.&#13;
Whereas the latter are capable of continuous pumping, dugwells generally sustain pumping for more&#13;
than 2-4 hours/day: thus most dug-wells generally irrigate only 1-2 ha. The average net area&#13;
provided with supplementary groundwater irrigation during the monsoon is about 1.4 ha. Smaller&#13;
wells powered by bullocks to lift a large bucket device ("mhotes") can provide supplementary&#13;
irrigation to about 0.3 ha of monsoon paddy.&#13;
22.   Detailed hydrogeological surveys of the area immediately below LMD (down to distributary&#13;
D13) indicates that well yields are 30-50 m3/day in the rabi season and 50-100 m 3/day in the&#13;
monsoon season. The Groundwater Department estimates that the rabi season well yields can be&#13;
expected to improve when canal irrigation becomes widespread and regular as a result of the&#13;
rehabilitation works to be undertaken by the project. Above LMD, there are about 19,500 pumped&#13;
wells and about 14,220 mhotes; below LMD up to km 234 of KKC, there are about 13,200 pumped&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 6 of 14&#13;
wells and about 4,950 mhotes. Thus the net project area irrigated above and below LMD is about&#13;
31,560 ha and 19,965 ha respectively. The current groundwater potential of the whole command area&#13;
(up to km 284) is about 24 TMC; this could increase by about 10% if the whole are were to be&#13;
irrigated. Water balance computations indicate that, with conversion of mhotes to pumped wells, a&#13;
pumped well increment of about 23,000 and 9,000 pumped wells can be installed above LMD and&#13;
below LMD respectively.&#13;
23.   Potential for Groundwater Drainage Problems. Intensive groundwater monitoring is&#13;
undertaken by the Groundwater Department. In the command above LMD there are 365 observation&#13;
wells monitoring a net area of about 294,000 ha; below LMD there are 239 observation wells of&#13;
which 115 monitor the command up to km 234 of KKC while the remainder monitor the area up to&#13;
km 284. Water levels are monitored five times a year while water samples are taken twice in April&#13;
and October. In the command above LMD, the pre-monsoon water table build-up has averaged 0.22-&#13;
0.27 m/year with a higher rise in canal head reaches because of their excessive water use. Currently,&#13;
above LMD, the gross area with a water table within 3 m of the ground during April is about 37,000&#13;
ha; about half of this area (less than 10% of the gross area) has pockets with a water table between 0-&#13;
2 m b.g.l.&#13;
24.    The Groundwater Department prepared a forecast the potential for waterlogging due to a&#13;
rise in the groundwater table as a result of increased recharge due to rehabilitation of the command to&#13;
km 234 of KKC. Assuming a uniform spread of the additional recharge and its retention in aquifer&#13;
storage, water table maps were prepared. The post-monsoon (October) map forecasts only small&#13;
pockets with water tables at less than 2 m b.g.l. The methodology was similar to that used for SRBC&#13;
and is therefore unconvincing because of the neglect of natural drainage to the Godavari River as it is&#13;
unreal to assume that all, or even a large proportion of incremental recharge will be retained in&#13;
storage. The Bank mission assessment is that significant problems of groundwater drainage and&#13;
adverse waterlogging will not develop in the project area even if groundwater development proves to&#13;
be lower than that assumed at full development. The natural groundwater drainage conditions will&#13;
prevent major long-term increases in permanent groundwater storage. The development of of&#13;
significant areas of shallow water tables will be confined to the valley bottoms and will not be&#13;
detrimental to the paddy crop which occupies most of such areas now and will most likely continue&#13;
to do so in the future.&#13;
25.    Groundwater Quality and Secondary Salinization. The EC maps of April 1993 show that&#13;
more than 90% of the area in the gross command area down to LMD is underlain with groundwater&#13;
with EC&lt;1,500 umhos/cm and most is EC&lt;750 umhos/cm. The small areas with EC&gt;1,500&#13;
umhos/cm roughly correlate with shallow water table areas in the same month, implying that there&#13;
may be a relationship between salt concentration and depth below the water table. This situation&#13;
persists into the post-monsoon of October 1993. However, the areas underlain by water with&#13;
EC&lt;3,000 umhos/cm are very small. They could well be related to pockets of constrained drainage&#13;
coupled with shallow water tables. They do not have significance in an area which has been&#13;
irrigated for up to 20 years. The command area below LMD shows a similar groundwater quality&#13;
pattern with small pockets of EC&lt;2,250 umhos/cm which, in general, relate to relatively shallow&#13;
water table areas. It is noteworthy that this area has received little or no canal irrigation and that they&#13;
are situated in valley bottoms occupied by the commands of very old tanks. It is concluded that&#13;
secondary salinization is very unlikely and that leaching by rains and irrigation will prevent a&#13;

occur.&#13;
D. Irrigation of Black Cotton Soils&#13;
Crop Root Zone Drainage Analysis&#13;
26.    The Problem. Despite the small likelihood of major regional water table rise in SRBC and&#13;
SRSP, there could be concern about the natural drainage of Black Cotton Soils having low&#13;
permeability at a depth of 150-180 cm b.g.l. and the likelihood of crop yield reduction due to&#13;
seasonal perched water tables above this semi-impermeable layer. An early pedological survey of&#13;
the SRBC command found some signs of such a layer in Black Cotton soils. They could also exist in&#13;
some of the Black Cotton soils of SRSP which have a limestone parent material. Consequently,&#13;
FAO experts considered it important to assess whether the proposed RWS irrigation regime could&#13;
give rise to seasonal perched water tables and even salinization of the crop root zone.&#13;
27.    Drainage Simulation Models. One of the major difficulties in estimation of water (and&#13;
salt) drainage out of the root zone (up to 2 m b.g.l.) is allowance for water drawn into the atmosphere&#13;
by crop transpiration and direct evaporation. A mathematical model that simulates water flow, salt&#13;
transport, plant water uptake and crop yield was used by FAO to evaluate transpiration, evaporation,&#13;
drainage and water table depth as a function of crop type, soil hydraulic properties and potential&#13;
evapotranspiration demand. The key parameter of this model is the soil's unsaturated hydraulic&#13;
conductivity as a function of soil moisture content. This function was determined in the field for&#13;
SRBC and SRSP black and red soils using a simple and quick method. The simulation studies used&#13;
average monthly precipitation and Class A evaporation data. The crops simulated were corn,&#13;
sunflower and groundnut. The time for germination and time to reach full crop canopy were used to&#13;
differentiate between potential evaporation and actual transpiration at different crop growth stages.&#13;
28.    The study concluded that under normal rates of groundwater drainage prevalent in the SRBC&#13;
command (about 6 mm/day) and for water tables at 6 m b.g.l. or more, no annual accumulation of&#13;
aquifer storage and waterlogging of the root zone would occur under the proposed irrigation regime.&#13;
Similarly, no salinity problems are expected. However where an impervious layer exists with a&#13;
permeability of about 2 mm/day, it was found that waterlogging could develop in 8 to 15 years. It is&#13;
therefore important to monitor water tables, especially where subsurface drainage may be slow so&#13;
that appropriate measures may be taken if pockets of waterlogging develop. Large areas of perched&#13;
water table are not expected because of the self-mulching attributes of black soils.&#13;
Local Irrigation Practices&#13;
29.    The above findings induced FAO experts to look carefully at irrigation practices on Black&#13;
Cotton (Vertisol) soils in the K.C. Canal command adjacent to the proposed SRBC command area.&#13;
Field observations and discussions with farmers and agricultural department staff showed&#13;
conclusively that farmers understand and use furrow irrigation for cash crops (e.g. cotton and&#13;
chillies) and are also conversant with the practice of irrigation scheduling (i.e. appreciate the need to&#13;
supply water to crops as and when needed). The soils allow farmers in many places to grow rice&#13;
alongside and surrounded by "dry" crops; however there is an increase in the amount of rice grown&#13;
in low-lying lands. It was concluded that farmers in the area have a good understanding of irrigation&#13;
of clay soils; it is clear from their observations that they understand the problems caused by over-&#13;
irrigation and schedule their irrigation to avoid ponding of water and crop damage. To a great&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 8 of 14&#13;
extent, the Black Cotton soils provide a suitable environment for irrigation since their uptake of&#13;
water can easily be observed and guide farmers' irrigation practices.&#13;
E. Environmental Management Plan&#13;
Compensatory Afforestation&#13;
30.    This EMP component is required in order to complete mandatory replacement of&#13;
government forest land areas utilized for the construction of canals prior to the proposed project. For&#13;
SRSP, this envisages completion of afforestation of 289 ha of degraded lands in the foreshore of the&#13;
Sriramasagar reservoir. In SRBC, an area of 885 ha will be reforested in the Kurnool district even&#13;
though only 149 ha of forest land would have been diverted for the sub-project at its current scope.&#13;
About 736 ha of forest land may be diverted in future if the Gorakullu Reservoir is constructed.&#13;
However, since clearance of this compensatory afforestation was requested and cleared for&#13;
immediate transfer to the State Forest Department in 1994, it would be undertaken under the project&#13;
since the rehabilitated lands are to serve as a source of timber, fuel and fodder for local villages and&#13;
alleviate the pressure on dwindling forest resources. The already identified degraded areas are to be&#13;
planted with suitable tree species and protected with cost-effective structural and non-structural soil&#13;
and water conservation measures. Various planting models were initially identified by the State&#13;
Forest Department and provision made for implementation infrastructure, nurseries etc. These&#13;
models have been modified for implementation by the Forest Development Corporation (FDC).&#13;
SRBC Eco-Restoration and Degraded Forest Improvement Program&#13;
31.    Development Impact. A detailed investigation of the flora and fauna along the alignment of&#13;
the main canal and within the command area of SRBC was undertaken by the State Forest&#13;
Department, the Zoological Survey of India and Society for Conservation and Management of&#13;
Natural Resources. It was found that the SRBC main canal would serve as a natural protective&#13;
barrier for the mammalian wild fauna in the reserve forests and hilly areas to its west and thus&#13;
facilitate their conservation. The provision of cross-drainage structures at all streams and springs&#13;
prevent any disruption of natural runoff in the command area and thus its fauna and flora are not&#13;
affected. At Rollapadu, the canal passes within 3 km of the Great Indian Bustard (Choriotis&#13;
nigriceps) bird sanctuary but would not have an adverse impact: in fact, its water would benefit all&#13;
terrestrial and aquatic birds. Within the command area, it is anticipated that irrigation would change&#13;
the dryland habitat, increase the cultivated area and, over time with increasing population, create&#13;
some pressure on forest resources.&#13;
32.    Mitigation Measures.  In order to ensure protect wildlife and forest resources from&#13;
developmental pressures, the following mitigation measures would be supported under the project:&#13;
(a) Degraded Area Development in Reserve Forests. In order to improve barren degraded areas of&#13;
thorny dry scrub species totaling 800 ha in five reserve forests near the command area, several&#13;
treatment models have been proposed involving gap planting, nursery pasture plots, agave&#13;
plantation, vegetative strips and soil and water conservation measures. The latter works will&#13;
include 100 percolation tanks within these and other reserve forests. The selected treatment mix&#13;
would depend on soil, slope and canopy cover of the treated area. In addition, another 300 ha of&#13;
degraded area outside the forest reserves would be planted with local species. A joint forestry&#13;
management approach was not been adopted for the treatment models as the treated areas are on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 9 of 14&#13;
remote government land far from villages, and are to be managed and harvested by the FDC to&#13;
gain revenue for project maintenance.&#13;
(b) Canal Bank Plantation. In selected stretches totaling 35 km along the main canal near reserve&#13;
forests, a double row of trees and will be planted to consolidate canal banks and serve as a partial&#13;
barrier to wildlife access. About 50% of the trees would be harvestable varieties such a Neem,&#13;
fruits etc. while the rest would be large canopy shade trees.&#13;
(c) Environmental Education Centers. Two well-equipped environmental education centers based&#13;
on the theme of water resources development and conservation are proposed near the command&#13;
area for public education purposes. The existing education center at the Rollapadu Bird&#13;
Sanctuary is also to be upgraded with models, exhibits, a library and four tourist suites. This&#13;
improvement would be part of an environmental awareness campaign related to grassland&#13;
ecology and endangered species such as the Great Indian Bustard.&#13;
(d) Nutritive Fodder Plots and Animal Watering. In order to reduce pressure on the pasture grass in&#13;
the reserve forests, 20 fodder plots of 2 ha each for wild herbivores will be developed with&#13;
irrigation water facilities for the dry season. In the degraded areas and on the fringes of reserve&#13;
forests near high priority villages, 100 ha of nutritive fodder plots will be developed to reduce&#13;
competition between cattle and wild herbivores. Saucer pits and check dam water holes will be&#13;
built in gullies and eroded depressions of the degraded areas for wildlife watering. In the priority&#13;
villages on the forest reserve fringes, breached tanks will be repaired and cattle watering&#13;
facilities provided.&#13;
(e) Environmental Monitoring and Anti-Poaching Units. A fully equipped monitoring and research&#13;
unit is to be established at the Rollapadu environmental education center to monitor the efficacy&#13;
of the environmental program. Three motorized anti-poaching vigilance squads are to be&#13;
established to protect forest wildlife.&#13;
SRSP Eco-Restoration Program&#13;
33.   Possible Impact. A detailed investigation of the flora and fauna along the alignment of the&#13;
main canal and within the command area of SRBC was undertaken by the State Forest Department,&#13;
the Zoological Survey of India and Society for Conservation and Management of Natural Resources.&#13;
The resultant program concentrates on district eco-restoration activities and safeguards in the area&#13;
below LMD inclusive of the new command below km 234 of KKC. The new command is not&#13;
funded under the project and borders on the Pakhal Wildlife Sanctuary which contains a population&#13;
of about 11 tigers.&#13;
The mitigation program components include:&#13;
(a) Degraded Forest Rehabilitation. Degraded areas totaling 1000 ha within 9 blocks of the 21,135&#13;
ha forest reserve area will be improved along the same lines as in SRBC.&#13;
(b) Canal Bank Plantation. This would be similar to SRBC for a length of 150 km.&#13;
(c) Development of LMD Bird Sanctuary. The 17 sq.km reservoir and foreshore vegetation area&#13;
would be declared a bird sanctuary in view of the many species of local aquatic and winter&#13;
migratory birds now supported by the water body. Investments required include: (i) demarcation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 10 of 14&#13;
surveys, biological inventory survey and preparation of a sanctuary management plan; (ii)&#13;
planting of 50 ha of Babul and Barringtonia saplings; (iii) construction of viewing towers,&#13;
shelters and staff buildings; (iv) equipment and staff. Two flora and fauna vigilance parties&#13;
would be established and equipped. Artisanal reservoir fishing is controlled by issue of Fisheries&#13;
Department licenses and would not interfere with the bird sanctuary situated on islands and the&#13;
foreshore. The existing fish seed farm would be expanded to include 20 nursery ponds, breeder&#13;
pond, seed parking hall and Chinese hatchery.&#13;
(d) Development of LMD Deer Park and Environmental Education Center. A recreational garden,&#13;
playground, aviary, water fowl pond and moated deer park would be established at LMD to cater&#13;
to the population of Karimnagar town. The park would contain a landscaped Environmental&#13;
Education Center building housing a library, auditorium and museum The center would be&#13;
equipped for educational exhibits, audio-visual and interactive displays.&#13;
(e) Pakhal Wildlife Sanctuary Improvement. In order to monitor and control the pressure on the&#13;
sanctuary area, two vigilance parties would be established and provided with buildings, transport&#13;
and communication equipment. Habitat improvement works would be built such as: (i)&#13;
boundary demarcation barricades, cattle-proof trenches, etc.; (ii) repairs and improvements of&#13;
animal water and fodder sources; and (iii) soil and water conservation works in degraded areas.&#13;
To reduce pressure on the sanctuary, a village eco-development program would be supported in&#13;
four selected villages. This program includes: livestock improvement and development of&#13;
fodder plots and watering facilities; provision of alternative energy sources; and income&#13;
generation schemes.  The details of this program, including the process of beneficiary&#13;
involvement in its formulation, are not yet available.&#13;
(f) Monitoring and Research. Incremental staff will be hired for a scientific unit to monitor the eco-&#13;
restoration program and will be provided with facilities and equipment in Karimnagar.&#13;
Catchment Area Treatment Program&#13;
34.    The AP Remote Sensing Applications Center has prepared catchment area treatment plans&#13;
(CATPs) based on collateral remote sensing data to reduce sediment inflow into the Srisailam and&#13;
Owk reservoirs serving SRBC and for the Sriramasagar and LMD reservoirs in SRSP. The land use&#13;
and cover of the watersheds comprising the free catchment (i.e. below upstream reservoirs) of each&#13;
reservoir has been analyzed to compute their sediment yield index and determine their treatment&#13;
priority. The CATPs include vegetative and structural soil conservation measures for all watersheds&#13;
having a high priority for soil erosion reduction. These measures include: (a) land protection using&#13;
afforestation, silvipasture and agroforestry treatment models for various categories of land type with&#13;
emphasis on degraded areas; (b) gully control works (rockfill and check dams) with vegetative&#13;
measures to arrest silt flow; and (c) greenbelt plantation with commercially viable trees along&#13;
reservoir foreshores, together with vegetative barriers and soil conservation structures where&#13;
necessary. The limited area treatment of the Sriramasagar reservoir catchment (1,104 ha and 129 silt&#13;
arresting tanks) derives from it being a supplement to ongoing government programs which have&#13;
already treated about 18,000 ha out of 45,000 ha.&#13;
The overall program of catchment treatment to be funded under the project is is summarized&#13;
in the table below:&#13;

Agroforestry Extension&#13;
35.    MOEF has stipulated that the command areas should have a mobile extension unit to&#13;
disseminate agroforestry techniques. A distribution target of 100,000 teak stumps and 20,000&#13;
assorted fruit tree seedlings every year for five years in SRBC and SRSP has been set for this&#13;
program. The seedlings will be distributed by mobile extension units established for this purpose.&#13;
Environmental Health Program&#13;
36.    A baseline survey of health care delivery capacity was conducted by the State Health&#13;
Directorate in 120 villages of the new command area of SRBC. The project will support a limited&#13;
environmental health program against water-bome and other diseases in each sub-project. This&#13;
includes: (a) immunization of 13,600 susceptible children against Japanese Encephalitis; (b)&#13;
distribution of chlorine tablets for pot chlorination and bleaching powder for protection of village&#13;
water supplies; (c) anti-malaria spraying in villages; (d) additional stores of drugs, disinfectants,&#13;
nutrients and X-ray film for primary health care clinics and hospitals in the command areas in order&#13;
to cope with the additional load of the project's transient laborers and workers during the&#13;
construction period; (e) a fully equipped mobile medical team and vehicle-cum-ambulance to visit&#13;
labor camps and provide treatment of minor ailments; and (f) establishment of a dispensary in SRSP.&#13;
Restoration after Construction&#13;
37.    Restoration of construction sites is included in the technical specifications of all construction&#13;
contracts as a contractual responsibility: hence a special financial provision is not required. This&#13;
includes treatment of borrow areas, muck stabilization during canal construction etc. For Owk&#13;
Tunnel in SRBC, the design provides for suitable disposal and stabilization of tunnel spoil.&#13;
Groundwater Development Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 12 of 14&#13;
38.   SRBC Groundwater Monitoring Studies. Provision has been made in the EMP for 8&#13;
professional Groundwater Department staff to monitor groundwater levels and quality and to plan&#13;
the promotion of conjunctive use to mitigate any waterlogging tendencies that may arise. This effort&#13;
would continue for the duration of the project.&#13;
39.   SRSP Groundwater Development Program. In addition to continuation of the ongoing&#13;
groundwater monitoring program, the EMP has made provision for GOAP assistance to promote&#13;
construction of 12,610 new wells and energization of 19,173 mhotes over a five year period. This&#13;
program would not only mitigate local waterlogging if it occurs, but also facilitate adjustment of rice&#13;
cultivators to RWS by enabling supplementation of intermittent canal flows from well supplies. The&#13;
total cost of over Rs, 1,514 million would be covered as follows: a 25% GOAP subsidy, a 15% equity&#13;
contribution from farmers, and 60% as credit from financial institutions such as NARBARD,&#13;
Scheduled Caste Corporation, District Rural Development Authority and banks. GOAP has issued&#13;
instructions to all District Collectors to extend all facilities to farmers available through normal&#13;
district well programs. The AP State Electricity Board is taking steps to improve power supplies.&#13;
The Bank/IDA does not provide any support for this well construction program under the project as&#13;
agricultural power tariffs are below national guideline norms of Rs.0.5 per kwh.&#13;
SRSP Environmental Monitoring Program&#13;
40.   An environmental monitoring program will be carried out in the SRSP command as follows:&#13;
Water .Qualiy. Surface and groundwater quality twice a year by the Groundwater Department.&#13;
-  SoiL. Soil characteristics such as conductivity, pH, salinity and texture will be sampled once&#13;
every three years; in areas prone to waterlogging, sampling will be carried out annually. The&#13;
implementing agency will be the soil conservation units of the Agriculture Department.&#13;
- Land Use. Post-construction monitoring will indicate status of borrow pits, temporary camp&#13;
sites, landfill sites, waste dumps. etc. The change in land use pattern will be monitored once&#13;
every five years using satellite imagery. The implementing agency will be the AP State Remote&#13;
Sensing Application Center.&#13;
*  Erosion and Siltation.  The Agriculture Department will monitor water sediment load,&#13;
effectiveness of soil conservation measures and erosion of canal bank spoil. In addition, ICADD&#13;
will undertake a reservoir sedimentation survey of Sriramasagar and Lower Mannair reservoirs&#13;
as part of the Dam Safety Component.&#13;
*  Spread of Aquatic Weeds. The Agriculture Department will monitor the density and problem&#13;
areas of aquatic weeds and the effectiveness of weed control measures.&#13;
*  Trends in Incidence of Water-Related Diseases. The Medical &amp; Health Department will monitor&#13;
trends in water-borne and related diseases and the adequacy of local curative and vector control&#13;
measures.&#13;
The above program will be monitored by an Environmental Cell in the PPMU. Progress will be&#13;
reviewed by project-level and state-level environmental committees constituted by Government&#13;
Order in February 1993.&#13;

POLICY ON FArtMERS' PARTICIPATION IN InnIGATION MANAGEMENT&#13;
1ltic State ol AndIinz a I Piandsh I has itivestcd lairge  i nlouilts or Its scalce linaticial&#13;
resources to creat surface irrigation schiemes. The net Irrigation potential created thus&#13;
far is 6.4 M ha. Inispitc of Ithis largo effcrt, statistics stiow ttiat only about 4.3 M ha or&#13;
67% of the potcntial created Is utilized thus leavIng a gap of about 2.1 M ha. or 33%&#13;
unutilized. Some of the main reasons fcr this gap are the non-complaince of farmers&#13;
to the designed cropping pattern, the poor conditions of the irrigation systems, and&#13;
the lack of operational plans. In addition to this gap, water distribution within the&#13;
command areas is often neither reliable nor equitable wvith large differences in water&#13;
availability betvween tlie hiead and tail end of irrigation canals.&#13;
Irrigation &amp; CAD Dept., has attempted to remedy this situation through various&#13;
measures among v.'hich are the rehabilitation of the distribution networks, the&#13;
introduction  of rotationlal watcr supply  based  on  structured  systems and  the&#13;
promulgation of tihe AP Irrigation Utilization and Command Area Development Act,&#13;
1984 authorizina tile creation of Command Area Devolopment Authorities (CAD) and&#13;
the formation of Pipe Committees. Though some improvements wvere noted, much&#13;
of the disorders noted previously continue and none of these initiatives have really&#13;
proved to bc fully sustainable. Thc failurc is mostly due to a top-down approach to&#13;
irrigation planning and managemenlt without adequate consullation with farmers.&#13;
Inr vicw or thc above difficulties, thie Irrigation &amp; CAD lhas initaited a pilot program&#13;
involving farmers participation in irrigation management at the minor level.  This&#13;
progrem was carried out with some success with thie essistance of an NGO In&#13;
D64 of SRSP. Based on field observations, the IU &amp; CAD Act legalizino farmers&#13;
organisations, and the experience of t!he pilt program, the GOAP would like to&#13;
develop a new approach to water manacemcnt. The new approach woulld be based&#13;
on participalory irrigation management tllroughi thie creation of Farmers Organisations.&#13;
It is proposcd to iiriplrcinncti this ncw approach first undicr lie proposed AP.111 Project&#13;
in the SRBC and SRSP commanids. THe salient features of the management policy&#13;
are as follows:&#13;
1. The farmers in the command of the projects will be encouraged to form Water&#13;
Users' Associationis to operate and nianage irrigation systems in thieir respective&#13;
area;&#13;
2. Irrigation system  upto minor level ccnsisting normally of an ayacut of 400 to&#13;
750 ha. v,ill bc placed under thie management of the respective Water Users'&#13;
Association under a rnemorandum  of understanding w;ith thie Department. The&#13;
enidcavour shall be to hiave prcfcrab!ly not niore than onc WUA in a Revenue&#13;
villagc.&#13;

3. The Water Uscrs' Associations will be autoriomous bodics whiich will furiction on&#13;
democratic principlcs n ld thieir aflalrs will be subjcct lo audit by prolessionals.&#13;
Tiho WUA will bo goverted une(or bye-liws to bo fiarncd unider tihe IU &amp; CAD&#13;
Act;&#13;
4. The endeavour of tthe Department will be to give increasing responsibility of&#13;
managing irrigation systems to WUAs and for the purpose it will:&#13;
i) make available assured and reliable water at the head of minor;&#13;
ii) Undertake rehabilitation and modernisation of the internal water distribution&#13;
system whierevcr WUAs are formed;&#13;
iii) facilitate fixation and collection of operation and maintenance charges from&#13;
water users.&#13;
5. Ttic WUA will bc at liberty to regulate distribution of water to tlhe water uscrs on&#13;
volumetric or any other basis and to leavy and collect panalities if any, Fixed by&#13;
it for violation of the water distribution schieme linalised for tile irrigation system&#13;
under its administreaive supcrvision;&#13;
6. By improving cflicicncy of the irrigation system  the WUAs will bc at liberty to&#13;
save water and make the water so saved available to users on payment;&#13;
7. The IU&amp;CAD Act vwill be suitably amended to provide for tile formation of WUAs&#13;
and to give suitable incentives for thier promotion;&#13;

FARMERS ASSOCIATIONS.&#13;
One of the major causes for the inefficient management of water resources is that there is&#13;
very little or no involvement of farmers in the management of the irrigation system. As a result&#13;
the supply of water to farmers is often unreliable, at variance with their needs, inequities&#13;
unsustainable and inefficient.&#13;
The situation is sought to be remedied substantially if farmers are actively involved in&#13;
the management of the irrigation system. the Ministry of Water Resources had urged the state&#13;
governments to set up farmers associations and issued guidelines as early as 1987.&#13;
Government of India have now decided to channel the plan allocations for CAD&#13;
Programme directly through the CAD Boards to the Farmers Associations to make them&#13;
responsive and accountable. In Andhra Pradesh a number of Farmers Associations ( Pipe&#13;
Committees) were formed in 1980's. However there has been slackening of pace in the 1990's.&#13;
Moreover, Some of the committees formed earlier have now become defunct. therefore the GOI&#13;
have felt that there is a need to form Farmers Associations in the State.&#13;
In His Letter, Minister of Water Resources , has conveyed that hereafter the Union&#13;
Government and the State Government should release funds to be utilised by  Farmers&#13;
Associations directly by the CAD Boards. He has also requested that the State Government&#13;
should immediately initiate steps to constitute Farmers Associations, CAD Boards and CAD&#13;
Council.&#13;
The Various Steps involved in thle formation of tlte Farmers Associations is listed&#13;
below:&#13;
1. Identify the Hydraulic Unit for which the FA is to be formed(Outlet, Minor, Branch). It&#13;
could be preferably be the minor, because of homogeneity andfinancial viability.&#13;
2. Motivate the farmer in order to, decide who should be Incharge of this crucial work &amp;&#13;
involve NGO's and WALMI's.&#13;
3. Reach Agreement among a minimum of fifty-one percent of land holders of land in the&#13;
command for formation of FA.&#13;
4. Decide the Act under which to register the Association/Society(Co-operative/Registn of&#13;
Societies Act/Companies Act.)&#13;
5. Draft bye-laws of Association. Bye-laws should be in accordance with the objective of&#13;
Participatory Irrigation Management.&#13;
6. Undertake Joint Inspection of the system by FA's, Irrigation Department and CADA&#13;

a R D E R&#13;
Sriramasaqar  Froject  (SRSF)  was  or iginally&#13;
conceived   and   constr-ucted   for  developing&#13;
backwat-d Telanarana area.   In SRSF' one third&#13;
area in the command was planned for paddy&#13;
(wet) dtring K"harif and about two thirds area&#13;
for ID durino Rabi.  This has led to unequtal&#13;
allocation and haphazard distribLttion of canal&#13;
waters.&#13;
Dur-irig oper-ation of the system in the last two&#13;
decades,  the  farmers  particularly  in  head&#13;
r-eaches of the distributories and minot-s drew&#13;
continuious water su1pply and grew wet cr-ops in&#13;
areas localized for ID deptiving the tail&#13;
enders of their legitimate share o-F water.&#13;
ConseqLuently even though irrigation potential&#13;
created in SRSP is 2.5 laIkh ha in Stage-I. the&#13;
area actLually ir-rigated is reported to be 1.2&#13;
to 1.3 lakh ha i.e. only about 5CI per cent of&#13;
potential created.   It is also r-epor-ted that&#13;
full  quantum  of water  meant to  serve  the&#13;
entire  ayacuLt   is  drawn  from  the  system&#13;
although the area utili:ina waiter is only one&#13;
thir-d oF the  tctal command oF 3.92 lakh hp&#13;

improved or at least restored to their pre-project level. This objective is to be materialized through&#13;
achieving specific targets of: (i) establishing a complete and competent institutional structure in the&#13;
project affected areas to be responsible for land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation of the&#13;
affected people; (ii) development of a R&amp;R policy to provide entitlements of the affected people; and&#13;
(iii) preparation and implementation of the resettlement and rehabilitation action plans. Specific&#13;
targets and actions are listed below:&#13;
No.   R&amp;R Targets                              Planned Actions&#13;

No.   R&amp;R Targets                              Planned Actions&#13;
units will be created under the Special Collectors, the Land Acquisitin&#13;
Unit and Rehabilitation Unit to be headed respectively by the Lnd&#13;
Acquisition Officers and Rehabilitation Officers. The Rehabilitation&#13;
Unit will be staffed with full-time R&amp;R officers. NGOs will be engaged&#13;
on a long-term basis to assist R&amp;R officers in the Land Acquisition Unit&#13;
and the Rehabilitation Unit to implement the RAPs in the field. The&#13;
GOAP issued Negotiations Committee Rules in 1992, stipulating the&#13;
constitution of Negotiation Committees and procedures for negotiated&#13;
compensation with the affected persons.&#13;
4. Village R&amp;R Committees (VRCY will be formed in the affected&#13;
villages with the help of NGOs and R&amp;R officers in an effort to&#13;
promote PAPs participation in R&amp;R activities implementation. The&#13;
VRC will be represented by members from each caste community i.e.&#13;
scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, backward caste, other castes and&#13;
women. in each revenue village. The VRCs will be actively involved&#13;
and fully participate in formulating Village Rehabilitation Action Plans&#13;
(VAP), facilitating PAPs participation and consultation, implementation&#13;
of the VAPs and monitoring of R&amp;R progress. They will work closely&#13;
with NGOs and R&amp;R officers.&#13;
B    Project          Detailed baseline socioeconomic surveys have been conducted for the&#13;
Socioeconomic   project by experienced consultants. The surveys covered the full&#13;
Survey           inventories of PAPs, tenants, sharecroppers and their socioeconomic&#13;
profile, household characteristics, full resources bases, impact of land&#13;
loss on incomes. The surveys have also identified the functionally&#13;
landless PAPs and have brought up grievances of PAPs due to the&#13;
completed land acquisition, such as bifurcation of land, uneconomic&#13;
status of remaining holdings etc. The surveys involved active&#13;
participation of PAPs and community leaders.&#13;
C Legal          Government of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) takes the Land Acquisition Act&#13;
Framework and  of 1894, as amended in 1984, as the basis for determining land&#13;
R&amp;R Policy       compensation. Since early 1995, GOAP started to work on an AP III&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation policy consistent with the Bank's&#13;
Operation Directive on involuntary resettlement. The agreed policy&#13;
with the Bank has been translated into local language and disseminated&#13;
among PAPs. The policy provides a legal framework for defining&#13;
project affected persons, their rights and entitlements, involvement of&#13;
non-government organizations and affected people, project R&amp;R&#13;
structure, grievance procedures.&#13;
D    R&amp; R Action      GOAP prepared, on the basis of the socioeconomic surveys and the&#13;
Plan             agreed R&amp;R Policy for AP III, RAPs for SRS Component, SRBC&#13;
Preparation      Component, Srisailam Retrofit and Lower Manair Retrofit.&#13;

identified 2,231 homeless people in both reservoir areas and the RAP&#13;
plans to provide each homeless family with 5 cents of developed&#13;
homestead land free of cost. The consultant has also determined that&#13;
about 778 PAPs have not received their income generation schemes&#13;
under AP II. The Retrofit is to provide Rs.8,000 per PAP (Below&#13;

I   Community        PAPs have been closely involved in the preparation of the socio-&#13;
Participation &amp;   economic surveys and RAPs. Census surveys were conducted through&#13;
Consultation     personal contacts and interviews with individuals or families, including&#13;
women, landless tenants, sharecroppers, government land assignees.&#13;
Detailed discussions were held with individual PAPs for their input on&#13;
assets lost, compensation paid or to be paid, court cases, impact on&#13;
living standards, economic rehabilitation activities and income&#13;
generation schemes and remaining problems.&#13;
Community participation and consultation is designed into the&#13;
implementation mechanism. Village R&amp;R Committees are to be set up&#13;
to ensure the full participation of the PAPs in the village-level R&amp;R&#13;
planning and its implementation. Village Committees, as&#13;
representatives of the PAPs, could help to improve the village RAPs&#13;
with constant feedback from the PAPs.&#13;
NGOs will be engaged to facilitate PAP participation. PAP and NGO&#13;
representatives are on the District R&amp;R Committees to further enhance&#13;
PAP participation in their development.&#13;
L   Implementation   GOAP has worked out detailed, PAP-specific compensation and&#13;
Mechanism        rehabilitation programs by village, phased out over a period of 5 years.&#13;
Detailed implementation schedules have been prepared for all R&amp;R&#13;
activities under the project (See Attachment 8 for the master schedule).&#13;
As an effort to further enhance PAP participation during&#13;
implementation, Village R&amp;R Committees are to be organized to fully&#13;
represent PAPs' opinions in implementation jointly with NGOs and&#13;
R&amp;R officers. As part of the detailed and final planning effort, Village&#13;
Committees, NGOs and R&amp;R officers will reconfirm and finalize all&#13;
details of PAP-specific rehabilitation activities in each Village R&amp;R&#13;
Action Plan. To ensure the success of the income generation schemes, a&#13;
lot of efforts have gone into training planning. A detailed training&#13;
program has been drawn up.&#13;
M.  Monitoring &amp;      Both internal and external monitoring will be conducted concurrently&#13;
Evaluation of    throughout the project implementation.. The monitoring bodies will&#13;
Resettlement     ultimately report to the State R&amp;R Committee, who will review and&#13;

Project Affected Persons Economic Rehabilitation Program (PAPERP)&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Government of Andhra Pradesh GOAP is implementing the Third Andhra&#13;
Pradesh Irrigation Project (AP III) with World Bank assistance. A.P.I.P-III comprises two&#13;
sub-projects namely (i) Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC) in Kurnool district and (ii) Sri&#13;
Rama Sagar Project (SRSP) in the Karimnagar and Warangal districts. Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation (R &amp; R) is small but significant and essential component of the project. The&#13;
displaced persons under the Srisailam Reservoir and Lower Manair Reservoir have been&#13;
covered for Resettlement and Rehabilitation under three Action Plans under the Second&#13;
Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project (AP II). The R &amp; R Component under AP III envisages&#13;
economic rehabilitation of the persons affected by the canal system, roads network, etc.,&#13;
together with retrospective completion of the AP II program.&#13;
2     GOAP has formulated an R &amp; R Policy indicating aims and objectives for the&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation. GOAP further conducted socioeconomic surveys, findings of&#13;
which form the base line for the PAPERP designed for the Economic Rehabilitation. The&#13;
Project Affected Persons Economic Rehabilitation Plan (PAPERP) is proposed to be&#13;
implemented over a period from 1997- 98 to 2001-2002. The policy stipulates involvement&#13;
of NGOs and its role in the PAPERP implementation. The Special Collector SRBC Kumool&#13;
and Special Collector SRSP Hyderabad are responsible for the planning, implementation and&#13;
monitoring of the PAPERP in the respective districts that have been prepared for each sub-&#13;
project. In order to enable them to implement PAPERP through such a process, the GOAP is&#13;
appointing a NGO to work with Special Collector, Land Acquisition.&#13;
The Aim&#13;
3.    The aim of the assignment is to help the Special Collector, Land Acquisition to&#13;
initiate and sustain a process of participatory PAPERP by mobilizing and organizing the&#13;
affected communities in implementing the PAPERP so that they could all be fully involved&#13;
in the restoration and improvement of their livelihood.&#13;
4     In order to achieve this aim, assignment will have the following specific objectives:&#13;
(a) Translation of the PAPERP into reality with the involvement of beneficiaries,&#13;
through PRA exercises; and&#13;
(b) Restoration or improvement of living standard in the affected communities.&#13;

Independent Monitoring And Evaluation of&#13;
Project Affected Persons Economic Rehabilitation Program&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Government of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) has proposed Third Andhra Pradesh&#13;
Irrigation Project (AP III) for World Bank Assistance. AP III comprises two sub-projects,&#13;
namely (i) Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC) in the Kumool district and (ii), Sri Rama&#13;
Sagar Project (SRSP) in the Karimnagar and Warangal districts.  Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation (R &amp; R) is a small but essential part of the project. The displaced persons&#13;
under the Srisailam Reservoir and Lower Manair Reservoir have been covered under the&#13;
three Resettlement Action Plans (1988-89, 89-90 and 91-93) under the AP II Project. The R&#13;
&amp; R Component under AP III envisages economic rehabilitation of the persons affected by&#13;
the canal system, roads network with a retrofit component for AP II.&#13;
2.    The GOAP has formulated a R &amp; R Policy indicating the aims and objectives for the&#13;
rehabilitation of the affected persons. A Project Affected Persons Economic Rehabilitation&#13;
Action Plans (PAPERP) has been prepared on the basis of this policy. The PAPERP&#13;
stipulates involvement of a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) for Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation so that the process of land acquisition and implementation of Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation is carried out as per the set targets. There are about 3,416 PAPs including&#13;
1,696 PAPs under SRBC sub-project (Kumool district) and 2,619 under SRSP sub-project&#13;
(Karimnagar and Warangal districts).&#13;
The Aim&#13;
3.    The GOAP has a separate cell under the Special Collector, Land Acquisition, to&#13;
implement the PAPERP with the help of NGOs. In order to ensure effective implementation&#13;
of the PAPERP and achievement of the designed targets, the GOAP is appointing a Non-&#13;
Governmental Organization to conduct independent monitoring and evaluation of the R&amp;R&#13;
components to provide an on-going assessment of R&amp;R implementation to enable timely&#13;
adjustments of implementation setup and procedures.&#13;
4.    In order to achieve this aim, the assignment of independent monitoring and evaluation&#13;
assignment will have the following specific targets:&#13;
* Concurrent monitoring of R&amp;R implementation progress as laid out in the&#13;
PAPERPs for SRBC and SRSP;&#13;
* Evaluation of R&amp;R progress and achievement of projected R&amp;R objectives;&#13;
formulation of the necessary measures to resolve problems and improve R&amp;R&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 24 of 26&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
5.    The assignment covers the two sub-projects: SRBC in the Kurnool district and SRSP&#13;
in Karimnagar and Warangal districts. The NGO will work closely with Special Collector,&#13;
Land Acquisition and his staff at the sub-projects for the period 1997-98 to 2001-2002.&#13;
6.    The NGO should describe its methodologies in its inception report, specifying the&#13;
type of quantitative and qualitative methods that will be used in the field for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
7.    The NGO should work with the resettlement agency to set up the computerized&#13;
monitoring system for R&amp;R component. The monitoring system should be operated by the&#13;
resettlement agency as part of its internal monitoring.  It is the responsibility of the&#13;
resettlement agency to track the daily physical progress of the project as part of the project&#13;
internal monitoring.&#13;
8.    As part of the effort to set up the monitoring system, the NGO should develop a&#13;
detailed list of specific and measurable indicators to indicate achievement of physical targets&#13;
and fulfillment of program objectives for the GOAP. The indicators should fit into the&#13;
framework of general project R&amp;R performance indicators prepared for the AP III project&#13;
and form the basis for R&amp;R internal monitoring. These indicators should cover:&#13;
* organization performance;&#13;
* community mobilization and participation;&#13;
* financial progress;&#13;
* physical progress;&#13;
* grievance redress;&#13;
* performance of rehabilitation activities;&#13;
* availability of support services;&#13;
* womens' development;&#13;
* impacts of training programs;&#13;
9.    The NGO should carry out concurrent monitoring of R&amp;R activities. Provided with&#13;
updated data on physical R&amp;R progress through internal monitoring, the NGO should verify&#13;
these information through systematic and extensive PAP contact monitoring activities in the&#13;
field and thorough diagnostic analysis. Contact monitoring and diagnostic studies should be&#13;
based on participating in public consultations and PAP meetings, interviewing a random&#13;
sample of PAPs and resettlement officers, field visit observations and survey of controlled&#13;
groups of PAPs.&#13;
10.   Based on analysis of provided progress data and contact observations in the field, the&#13;
NGO should be able to determine whether the goals of R&amp;R--namely maintenance or&#13;
increase of PAP living standards--are achieved through evaluating:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;

* the functioning of consultative and participatory arrangements;&#13;
* the operation of designed economic activities;&#13;
* the functioning of the grievance redress mechanism; and&#13;
* the restoration of PAP living standards.&#13;
11.   The NGO will conduct a socioeconomic evaluation of the PAPERP implementation at&#13;
project completion to measure the living standards of the affected persons against that&#13;
established in the socioeconomic survey before the project.&#13;
12.   The NGO should submit semi-annual monitoring and evaluaton reports to the GOAP&#13;
and the World Bank.&#13;

iii) For masonry and concrete, the stren4th of mortar and&#13;
concrete is as specified  in  ajreement.  Laboratory  has to desijn the&#13;
proportions  of  different inyredients  throuyh  tests  for  the  specified&#13;
stren-jth . The tjrojortioniny shall be done by wei,ht.&#13;
iv) For concrete and mortars where strejnth is not jiven and&#13;
only proportions have been specified the s tren,th of mix be worked out&#13;
the laboratory and this should be treated as standard for execution.&#13;
v) When controlled concrete is specified it is essential that mix&#13;
desi9n be done.&#13;
vi) Since the strenjth of cement varies from batch to batch in&#13;
a cement factory itself, it is essential that a relation between strenjth&#13;
of cement versus strenyth  of concrete may be worked out in the lab.&#13;
Well in advance of the startiny  of the work.  This would facilitate in&#13;
furnishind the proper proportion to the field staff for the mix for it&#13;
entails addinj or reducing cement content based on the strenjth of&#13;
cement.&#13;
vii) The stren,th of concrete is specified for 28 days.  It will&#13;
be difficult for 28 days to set the strenjth of concrete and assess its&#13;
4uality.   11ence  accelerated  curiny  test be  under taken  as  per  the&#13;
relevant  I.S.  usin,  boilding  water  method.   From  this  method  a&#13;
relationship  between  stren-,th  attained  with  aceelarated  curing  versus&#13;
normal curinj at 28 days be arrived at.&#13;
viii) Apart from these, control charts for cement and concrete&#13;
will also be prepared in the Laboratory  to assess the level of quality&#13;
control and to take remedial measures for the defective works, if any.&#13;
Other statistical analysis as reciuired would also be under taken.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT&#13;
BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
Economic and Environmental Impacts&#13;
1.    Agricultural Benefits. Assistance to GOAP for rehabilitation and completion of the SRSP&#13;
253,000 ha command area and completion of the 65,000 ha SRBC project begun under the AP II&#13;
project would add 153,000 ha to the 2.3 million ha of surface irrigation commands in AP. The&#13;
agricultural objective of these works is to promote the production of high value cash crops in upland&#13;
irrigation schemes by improved water delivery, applied farming systems research, irrigation&#13;
agronomy extension and farmer training. These inputs would result in significant incremental&#13;
agricultural production consisting of cereals and pulses, oilseeds, cotton and other cash crops. Project&#13;
agricultural output would generate an annual Value Added to the local economy estimated at Rs.5.03&#13;
billion (about US$140 million) in 1995 prices. These project outputs would be sustained by&#13;
investment to ensure the safety and economic life of the Srisailam and Sriramasagar dams which, in&#13;
turn, would ensure sustained irrigated and hydroelectric power production within the Krishna and&#13;
Godavari river basins outside the project areas. Completion of the AP II command area feeder road&#13;
program would promote farm produce marketing and provide quantifiable economic benefits in&#13;
travel time and vehicle operating cost savings.&#13;
2.     Employment.  The number of directly benefiting farm families is estimated at about&#13;
447,700 (about 2.24 million people). At full development, the increased demand for farm labor would&#13;
amount to about 31.6 million man-days per annum (equivalent to about 105,450 full-time jobs). About&#13;
one half of the manpower demand would be supplied by hired labor, the majority of which consists of&#13;
landless workers. The increased agricultural production would generate off-farm employment and&#13;
have significant employment multiplier effects. It is estimated that over 26,000 transport, marketing&#13;
and processing jobs would be generated in the sub-project area Districts. Construction of civil works&#13;
would generate a temporary five year increase in local employment opportunities since a large number&#13;
of unskilled laborers would be employed in construction during project implementation period.&#13;
3.     Afforestation  Products  and  Environmental Conservation.   The  Environmental&#13;
Management Plan component would also generate several diverse benefits. These include: (a) reduced&#13;
reservoir sedimentation as a result of soil and water conservation in treated catchments comprising&#13;
reservoir foreshore areas; (b) generation of forest products by compensatory afforestation, farm&#13;
forestry, canal bank and the green belt plantations; (c) water-borne disease control under the&#13;
environmental health program; (d) natural resources and wildlife conservation in protected areas would&#13;
be improved; and (e) project programs and two environmental education facilities would be provided to&#13;
increase the environmental awareness of the local population along with agro-forestry training.&#13;
Investments in a comprehensive environmental monitoring program would monitor progress in&#13;
improvement of the regional environment and conservation. The above benefits are not readily&#13;
quantifiable in economic terms: however, compensatory afforestation, canal bank and reservoir green&#13;
belt plantation would produce about significant quantities of salable fuelwood, pulpwood, faggotwood&#13;
in the future.&#13;

Impact on Farm Incomes and Poverty Alleviation&#13;
5.     Farm  Model Analysis.  The project impact on farm  incomes has been assessed by&#13;
representative farm models based on average holding sizes of 1.1 ha for SRSP and 1.8 ha for SRBC as&#13;
these represent about 80% and 70% respectively of total farm holdings in the two sub-project areas&#13;
(Table 16). Farm model net incomes were evaluated for three development scenarios: the present (P),&#13;
the future without project (FWOP) and the future at full development with the project (FWP). The&#13;
average 1995 financial farm gate prices prevailing in the sub-project areas were used to value outputs&#13;
and inputs in the computation of unit area crop budgets for each likely crop under each of the three&#13;
scenarios. The per ha financial crop budgets are given in Tables 1- 12 along the crop yield assumptions&#13;
used. Farm cropping patterns are modeled on the regional cropping patterns for each of the three&#13;
scenarios (Tables 13-15). The farm model analysis results are detailed in Table 17. A summary of&#13;
average farm net income results is given in the table below:&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 3 of 39&#13;
6.    The impact of the project on project area farm incomes would be substantial. At full&#13;
development, annual net farm incomes in with project are estimated to increase by 200%-360% in areas&#13;
where presently there is little or no canal irrigation (i.e. in SRBC and in SRSP below LMD), and by&#13;
about 100% in areas where presently there is already some canal and well irrigation (in SRSP above&#13;
LMD). Incremental annual net farm incomes in SRSP range from Rs.12,025 for farms in the above&#13;
LMD area to Rs 18,150 in the below LMD area, while in SRBC they could average about Rs.48,395.&#13;
The incremental benefit cost ratio for SRSP farms is about 2 while that of SRBC could attain 3.5.&#13;
7.    Poverty Alleviation Impact. In Andhra Pradesh, the number of population living below the&#13;
poverty line has declined from 44% in 1981 to 32% in 1991, compared with 48% and 30% respectively&#13;
for all India. In the project districts, the number of population who live below the poverty line range&#13;
from 36% in SRBC and 50% in SRSP. The percentage of landless population in the project areas is&#13;
estimated to be about 25% in the SRBC and 21% in SRSP. Since a farm family of five requires an&#13;
annual income of about Rs. 11,000 to be above the Andhra Pradesh absolute poverty threshold, the&#13;
results for the "present" (P) scenario shown in the table imply that, at present, 80% of farmers in SRSP&#13;
and 70% of farmers in SRBC have incomes below the poverty threshold of Rs. 11,000 per annum.&#13;
Given that opportunities for off-farm incomes are limited, it may be assumed that the per capita income&#13;
of most of these families and those of the landless population at present do not reach this level. Under&#13;
the FWOP scenario farm income would increase very marginally above the poverty line threshold while&#13;
under the full development FWP scenario, all average farm incomes would be above the poverty line.&#13;
Irrigation Management Reform&#13;
8.    Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM). Having served as a catalyst for GOAP&#13;
irrigation sector management and fiscal reform, the project would be of a pilot nature to test&#13;
management reform modalities for statewide adoption. Its pilot benefits include: (a) finalization of&#13;
legal and administrative modalities for empowerment of irrigators to take over the and operation and&#13;
maintenance of minor canal networks by voluntary establishment of autonomous Water User&#13;
Associations (WUAs); (b) devolution of responsibility for equitable water delivery to WUAs; and (c)&#13;
involvement of irrigators in joint management of reservoirs and major canal schemes through&#13;
democratic representation on public Command Area Development Boards or Scheme Committees.&#13;
Thus a significant part of the burden of canal network O&amp;M funding and enforcement of water&#13;
delivery discipline would be transferred to irrigation scheme beneficiaries.&#13;
9.    Improved Irrigation Service. An important benefit of the project would be the piloting of&#13;
modalities to realize GOAP strategy for increasing the potential of upland canal commands having&#13;
scarce water resources. The strategy is based on an ICADD focus on: (a) providing intermittent&#13;
water supply uniformly to a whole command and allowing farmers to cultivate crops of their choice&#13;
with available water supplies, instead of using Localization to regulate high consumptive use crops&#13;
to specific locations and seasons; and (b) ensuring reliable and adequate water supply to WUA&#13;
jurisdictions by specific ICADD scheme organizations having system O&amp;M and water management&#13;
as their primary function. Thus, success of the twin pronged approach of PIM and improved&#13;
irrigation service under the project would lay the foundation for improvement of irrigation efficiency&#13;
in upland areas and contribute to the irrigation sector's unavoidable adaptation to growing water&#13;
demands from other sectors.&#13;
10.   Improved ICADD Implementation Capacity. The project's construction quality assurance&#13;
arrangements (including ICADD construction staff training and and management of improved civil&#13;
works contract documents developed for the project), together with the focus on public consultation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 4 of 39&#13;
and participation, would improve ICADD's implementation capacity for other large state irrigation&#13;
projects. The project R&amp;R Policy and its implementation arrangements sets a precedent for more&#13;
equitable treatment of project affected families of future irrigation projects and the experience to be&#13;
gained would improve ICADD's R&amp;R implementation capacity.&#13;
B. Economic Analysis&#13;
Analysis Approach and Methodology&#13;
11.    Project Components Considered. The project would modernise/rehabilitate the existing&#13;
irrigation infrastructure in the Sriramasagar Project (SRSP), and complete the on-going irrigation works&#13;
to develop the 65,000 ha Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC) command. In SRSP, the modernisation&#13;
and rehabilitation works would be carried out within the 165,000 ha command served by km 0-146 of&#13;
Kakatiya Canal above Lower Mannair Dam (LMD), where the existing irrigation network is shrinking&#13;
due to neglect, and along its km 146-234 below LMD serving a 88,000 ha area where there are already&#13;
some distributaries but very few minor canals. The economic rates of return (ERRs) and Net Present&#13;
Values (NPVs) have therefore been calculated separately for: (a) the three commands of the sub-project&#13;
areas (SRBC, above LMD and below LMD in SRSP); (b) SRSP as a whole; and (c) the overall project.&#13;
12.    The analysis included only the direct costs to be incurred and benefit accrual from the irrigation&#13;
sub-projects and the feeder road program. This included R&amp;R expenditures for SRBC only since SRSP&#13;
R&amp;R expenditures are provided for addressing the impoverishment of people outside the command area&#13;
that were affected by the construction of irrigation works under the AP 11 project. However, the&#13;
investments for ensuring the safety of the Srisailam Dam spillway were excluded from the analysis&#13;
because their very significant benefits would be attributable to the protection against a possible&#13;
irreparable the dam's hydroelectric plants and other downstream facilities in the river basin, as well as&#13;
stoppage of Madras and Telegu Ganga Project water supply. Consequently inclusion of these benefits&#13;
in the form of damage prevention would distort the economic assessment of SRBC as an irrigation&#13;
project on the one hand, while the apportionable investment cost to SRBC is very small on the other.&#13;
The costs and benefits of the Environment Management Plan were excluded from the analysis because&#13;
most of the benefits are related to regional environmental conservation while the present value of direct&#13;
benefits such as revenues derived from afforestation activities, are very small in relation to quantifiable&#13;
agricultural benefits.&#13;
13.   Treatment of Groundwater Development. The area irrigated by village irrigation tanks has&#13;
remained more or less constant in both sub-project areas and is not expected to increase. However,&#13;
there has been substantial groundwater development within and outside the SRSP sub-project area&#13;
because of increased recharge due to canal seepage, improved electrification, cheap credit and the&#13;
limited coverage of the deteriorating irrigation network. This activity will likely continue in the future&#13;
albeit at a reduced rate within the SRSP command because of the availability of greatly expanded canal&#13;
irrigation after project completion. The total area irrigated by electrified and bullock-driven wells is&#13;
currently about 50,000 ha and could potentially be increased by about 30,000 ha. Although conversion&#13;
of the bullock-driven wells to electric pumping is possible to expand their coverage by 5,000-8,000 ha,&#13;
this is unlikely once canal irrigation is available. However, given the uncertainties of private sector&#13;
investment in wells in SRSP after scheme rehabilitation, the analysis postulates that the private&#13;
development of groundwater would continue at the same level in both the "With Project" (WP) and&#13;
"Without Project" (WOP) scenarios. Accordingly, it is assumed that in SRSP the additional wells&#13;
installed by rice cultivators to cope with the rotational water supply regime in the WP case would equal&#13;
the number that would be installed as a response to inadequate canal irrigation coverage under the WOP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 5 of 39&#13;
scenario albeit not in the same locations. Therefore, the economic resource costs of development and&#13;
operation of wells and their benefits have been excluded in both the WOP and WP cases for SRSP.&#13;
14.    For the new SRBC command, the limitations of groundwater exploitation make it unlikely that&#13;
groundwater development will expand significantly beyond its present level of about 3,500 ha as the&#13;
hydrogeology of 70% of the command does not lend itself to viable groundwater development. The&#13;
maximum potential increment in groundwater development is only about 5,000 ha and then only if&#13;
water tables rise significantly after several years in parts of three or four of the sixteen irrigation blocks&#13;
of the command area as a result of seepage losses and a relatively less pervious subsurface layer (Annex&#13;
CC). Thus, groundwater development is regarded as identical for both the WP and WOP scenarios and&#13;
not included in the SRBC economic analysis.&#13;
15.    Derivation of Economic Benefits. The quantified benefits are mainly incremental agricultural&#13;
production due to cropping pattern and productivity changes in each command, supplemented by an&#13;
estimate of the likely economic benefits that could be attributed to feeder road investments (e.g.&#13;
economic savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time). In SRSP, the agricultural benefits are&#13;
expected to come mainly from significant shifts from low value to higher value crops as a result of&#13;
rehabilitation of the existing irrigation network and expansion of reliable canal irrigation to the whole&#13;
command. For SRBC, project benefits are derived from the change from rainfed to irrigated production&#13;
in the form of higher crop yields, an increase in cropping intensity and shift to higher value crops. The&#13;
WOP and WP cropping pattems were initially based on data and estimates provided by agricultural&#13;
research and Agriculture Department staff and modified on the basis of Participatory Rural Appraisals'&#13;
(PRA) managed by a specialized NGO with GOAP assistance. The PRA was based on farmer&#13;
consultations conducted in 70 and 48 villages respectively above and below LMD in SRSP, and in 42&#13;
villages within the SRBC command area. Proposed cropping pattems resulting from the PRA and&#13;
proposed crop yields were reviewed during project preappraisal and finalized by agreement between&#13;
Bank, FAO, GOAP and Agricultural University agronomists.&#13;
16.    Sensitivity/Risk Analysis. Risk and assumptions that may not fully materialize are treated in&#13;
the sensitivity analysis by varying benefit and cost streams to reflect particular risk scenarios. The risks&#13;
analyzed include: (a) seasonal water delivery deficits; (b) the percentage change in net benefits or&#13;
project costs (i.e. "switching values") that would reduce ERRs to the opportunity cost of capital (12%);&#13;
(c) impact of implementation delays; (d) combinations of increased costs and lagging benefits; (f)&#13;
expanded rice cultivation instead of the expected predominantly upland cropping pattern of cash and&#13;
food crops grown under a rotational water supply regime; and (g) over-estimation of projected yields&#13;
for rice and cash crops.&#13;
Cost Assumptions&#13;
17.    Pricing Framework. The economic analysis has been carried out in 1995 constant prices over&#13;
a project life of 30 years. All local costs, including unskilled labor and other non-traded goods, were&#13;
converted to economic costs and values by using a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.90. The&#13;
economic prices of traded commodities and fertilizers were derived from the world market price&#13;
forecasts and adjusted for transport and handling charges to farm gate prices (Table 18).&#13;
The PRAs are documented in the following ICADD reports: (a) Agricultural Aspects of Srisailam Right&#13;
Branch Canal Command, June 1994; and (b) Agricultural Aspects of Sriramasagar Command, July 1994.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 1O&#13;

18.   Irrigation Investment. The investment in irrigation civil works, including command area&#13;
development, equipment, buildings and physical contingencies is estimated at: (a) Rs.4,544 million and&#13;
Rs.2,099 million for commands above and below LMD respectively; and (b) Rs.5,999 million for&#13;
completion of SRBC. These works require a mixture of equipment, local materials, fuel and both&#13;
skilled and unskilled labor. Based on a sample of seven ongoing construction contracts, these costs&#13;
may be broken down into about 13.5% in taxes and duties, 11.5% in foreign exchange components, and&#13;
75% local materials, unskilled labor, engineering and administration. Local costs were adjusted to&#13;
economic prices by using the SCF of 0.9. On this basis, a specific conversion factor (CF) for&#13;
construction equal to 0.79 was derived.&#13;
19.   Irrigation O&amp;M. Annual irrigation operation and maintenance costs (O&amp;M) are estimated at&#13;
Rs.494/ha in SRBC and SRSP below LMD, and an increment of Rs.314/ha in the existing irrigation&#13;
areas in above LMD (currently O&amp;M expenditures in this command are Rs. 120/ha). These costs were&#13;
adjusted to economic terms by SCF of 0.90 as they consist mostly of salaries, local materials and&#13;
unskilled labor.&#13;
20.    Dam Safety Assurance. Investment costs--excluding those to be incurred for safety of the&#13;
Srisailam Dam spillway--are mainly consultancy services and studies, and some equipment. Total&#13;
costs, including physical contingencies, are estimated at Rs.35 million for above LMD, Rs. 19 million&#13;
for below LMD in SRSP2 and Rs.45 million for SRBC. The financial costs were converted to border&#13;
prices by using SCF of 0.90.&#13;
21.    Resettlement and Rehabilitation. The project provides funds for R&amp;R programs, including&#13;
grant packages, training and community infrastructures, to people whose lands were and would be&#13;
acquired for construction under the previous AP II project and under this project. The total costs,&#13;
including physical contingencies but excluding land compensation, are estimated at Rs. 173 million for&#13;
SRBC and Rs.138 million for areas beyond km 234 of Kakatiya Canal. The latter costs were excluded&#13;
from the economic analysis (para. 12). The local costs were adjusted to border prices by using SCF of&#13;
0.90, except for investments in community infrastructure which were adjusted by CF of 0.79.&#13;
22.    Agricultural Support Services.  Total costs over the implementation period, including&#13;
physical contingencies, are estimated at Rs.178 million and Rs.1 14 million respectively for SRSP's&#13;
above and below LMD commands, and Rs.139 million for SRBC. To provide continuing support for&#13;
agricultural extension and water user associations thereafter, annual costs of Rs.7.7 million, Rs.5.8&#13;
million and Rs.7.9 million are provided for the above LMD, below LMD and SRBC commands in that&#13;
order. Local costs were adjusted to border prices by using SCF of 0.90.&#13;
23.    Feeder Roads. The total length of rural roads completed under AP II (up to March 1995) were&#13;
171 km in the above LMD, 265 km in the below LMD and 102 km in SRBC. During FY95/96, 47 km&#13;
of road were completed in the above LMD, 22 km in the below LMD and only 5 km in SRBC. An&#13;
additional 94 km of on-going and new roads would be completed during the project period. In order to&#13;
complete residual works started under the previous AP II project's R&amp;R program, about 108 km of&#13;
rural roads would be constructed in 104 resettlement villages for reservoir oustees under the project's&#13;
R&amp;R component as shown in the table below.&#13;
2   In the separate analyses of the above and below LMD commands, the dam safety assurance costs included&#13;
in the analyses were allocated in the proportion of 65:35 to each command.&#13;

24.    Using the practice followed on other Bank rural road projects in India, only 50% of feeder road&#13;
construction costs were included in the economic analysis because several known benefits cannot be&#13;
easily quantified. The SRSP cost estimates used on this basis were Rs.25 million and Rs. 15 million&#13;
above and below LMD respectively, while for SRBC the cost used in the analysis was Rs.71.5 million.&#13;
Annual O&amp;M costs have been based the average costs of Rs.35,000/km estimated by the AP&#13;
Department of Roads and Buildings. All financial costs were adjusted to border prices by a CF of 0.79.&#13;
25.    Foregone Benefits of Land Used for Construction. A total of 75 ha and 312 ha were&#13;
acquired for the construction of SRSP feeder roads in the above LMD and below LMD commands&#13;
respectively. In SRBC, a total of 2,244 ha were and would be acquired for the construction of irrigation&#13;
infrastructure and feeder roads in SRBC. The foregone benefits from land lost for construction have&#13;
been valued at the economic net production value of crops under the without project scenario. These&#13;
are estimated at about Rs. 17,560/ha and Rs. 11,550/ha for SRSP's above and below LMD commands&#13;
and Rs.8,1 10/ha in SRBC.&#13;
26.    Foregone Benefits of Hydroelectric Power. When SRBC is completed and water is used for&#13;
irrigation, there could be some loss of hydroelectric power due to diversion of stored water for&#13;
irrigation. Simulation studies indicate that, assumingfull development of the Krishna river basin, there&#13;
could be about 45 million kwh (Gwh) of power generation foregone annually out of a potential&#13;
generation of 2,435 Gwh with a 97% reliability (Annex KK). Although the basin is not yet fully&#13;
developed and larger irrigation projects are planned, this opportunity cost has been attributed to SRBC&#13;
only to capture losses that may occur in the state economy, i.e. such as the cost of purchasing power&#13;
from other sources. Based on the estimates of AP State Electricity Board, the marginal cost of&#13;
electricity--ranging from Rs.1.2/kwh to Rs.2.0/kwh--is averaged at Rs.1.6/kwh. Thus, the forgone&#13;
hydropower benefits at full development have been valued at Rs.72 million annually.&#13;
Benefit Assumptions&#13;
27.    Market Prospects. Andhra Pradesh is a net exporter of food grains, oilseeds, sugarcane and&#13;
fruits. Incremental production resulting from the project will be a small percentage of AP's total&#13;
agricultural production and therefore would be readily handled by existing marketing channels. Prices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 8 of 39&#13;
of oilseeds are likely to be kept steady by India's high income elasticity of demand for edible oils, and&#13;
by GOI's continuing efforts to reduce its large vegetable oil imports. In the long run, prices of&#13;
agricultural produce would be dictated by international market prices. For cotton, the production trend&#13;
indicates a change from short and medium-staple to long-staple cotton which responds better to&#13;
irrigation and is internationally more readily marketable.&#13;
28.    SRSP Sub-Project Cropping Pattern. In the 163,874 ha command above LMD where&#13;
currently about 30-40% of the area receives canal irrigation, overall cropping intensity is about 147%&#13;
due to the presence of tanks and wells. The maximum gross canal irrigated area has never exceeded&#13;
106,000 ha, while in 1992/93 it was only 80,268 ha implying an irrigation intensity of only about 49%&#13;
due to deficiencies in the water distribution system resulting from deferred maintenance. Rice is&#13;
cultivated on over 95% of the area irrigated by canals. In the 67,431 ha command below LMD where&#13;
the maximum gross area irrigated was 25,648 ha in 1990/91, the cropping pattern is subsistence&#13;
oriented and its cropping intensity is about 109%. A participatory rural appraisal was conducted by&#13;
ICADD to determine likely changes in cropping patterns in the advent of command area rehabilitation&#13;
and increase in the area under canal irrigation.&#13;
29.    Based on the past cropped areas and production trends in the sub-project areas, the WOP&#13;
cropping intensity in the above LMD areas is expected to remain at the present level, but cropping&#13;
patterns would change by a shift towards high value crops. Cropping intensity in the below LMD area&#13;
is estimated to increase slightly to 114% under the WOP scenario. The present and expected cropping&#13;
patterns in the two sub-project areas are shown in Tables 13 and 14. However, with rehabilitation of the&#13;
canal network, the cropping intensity is expected to reach not less than 150% because of conjunctive&#13;
groundwater use, made largely possible by the higher aquifer recharge rates due to irrigation. The&#13;
principal crops grown in the WP scenario would be paddy, maize, pulses, groundnuts, sunflower, cotton&#13;
(mainly below LMD), sugarcane (mainly above LMD) and vegetables.&#13;
30.    SRBC Sub-Project Cropping Pattern. The present cropping intensity in the SRBC project&#13;
area is about 103%. The rainfed cropping pattern is largely subsistence oriented: food grains and&#13;
legumes for home consumption and oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane and vegetables as cash crops. Double&#13;
cropping is sustained by wells irrigating about 3,500 ha. The existing cropping pattern was determined&#13;
from agricultural statistics and a participatory rural appraisal survey of potential project beneficiaries&#13;
conducted by ICADD. The survey also elicited responses about crop preferences and likely crop mixes&#13;
under irrigation. Without irrigation, neither the present crop mix nor cropping intensities are likely to&#13;
change much. However, better extension services, coupled with appropriate rainfed production&#13;
technology, and increased adoption of high yielding variety seeds may enable yields to increase&#13;
somewhat without the project. Based on the past cropped areas and production trends in the sub-project&#13;
area, cropping intensity under the "without project" (WOP) scenario is estimated to increase slightly to&#13;
about 107% (Table 15). With irrigation under the "with project" (WP) scenario, production would&#13;
become more stable, intensified and would shift to higher value crops. Cropping intensity is estimated&#13;
to reach about 160%. The largest output increments are expected from oilseeds (groundnut, soybean&#13;
and sunflower), sugarcane, and vegetables, and from the change to long-staple cotton (para. 27).&#13;
31.    Benefited Areas. The build-up rate of benefited areas was derived from the projected&#13;
command area contract completion schedule. The maturation rate of irrigation benefits has been&#13;
assumed over 3 years at a constant rate in the above LMD command which is already irrigated and over&#13;
5 years in commands where new irrigation would be introduced. Incremental annual benefited areas by&#13;
sub-projects are summarized below:&#13;

32.   Economic Prices of Commodities and Inputs. The economic prices of paddy, maize, sugar,&#13;
soybeans, sorghum, groundnuts and fertilisers were based on the average FY2000-2005 import parity&#13;
prices and cotton export parity price derived from the World Bank's Commodity Price Projection as&#13;
shown in Table 18. The domestic costs of transport, handling charges and processing were adjusted by&#13;
SCF of 0.90. The economic prices of non-traded commodities were derived by applying the SCF to&#13;
prevailing financial farm gate prices. Table 19 gives a summary of financial and economic prices.&#13;
33.   Opportunity Cost of Labour. Current market wage rates for hired unskilled labour range&#13;
from Rs.20 per man-day during slack periods to Rs.30 per man-day during peak periods in SRSP, and&#13;
from Rs. 15 per man-day to Rs.25 per man-day in slack and peak periods respectively in SRBC. The&#13;
unskilled labour wage is averaged at Rs.25 per man-day in SRSP and Rs.20 per man-day in SRBC. The&#13;
shadow wage rate is assumed to be the average market wage, adjusted by SCF of 0.90.&#13;
34.    Feeder Road Benefits. Benefits generated from rural feeder roads have been quantified from&#13;
vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings, passenger time saved and the incremental load from time saved.&#13;
The analysis has been based on the results of surveys conducted in December 1994 by the AP&#13;
Department of Roads and Highway on 12 rural feeder roads in SRSP and 6 feeder roads in SRBC.&#13;
Traffic counts and VOC savings were covered under the surveys while the passenger and incremental&#13;
load time saved were based on the Central Roads Research Institute "Impact of Rural Roads Traffic&#13;
Flow Patterns and Economic Benefits", case study in Haryana, 1987, updated to 1995 constant prices.&#13;
Based on the above information and assumptions, annual economic benefits per km have been&#13;
estimated at Rs.227,465/km/year in SRSP and Rs.207,130 in SRBC as shown in Tables 20 and 21.&#13;
35.    Under the project, annual economic benefits from rural roads at full development are estimated&#13;
at Rs.10.7 million in the above LMD command, Rs.5.0 million in the below LMD command and&#13;
Rs.44.1 million in SRBC. Including the benefits generated from feeder roads constructed under the&#13;
previous AP II project, annual economic benefits from rural roads at full development are estimated at&#13;
Rs.49.5 million and Rs.65.1 million in the above LMD and below LMD commands of SRSP and&#13;
Rs.65.2 million in SRBC.&#13;

Economic Rate of Return&#13;
36.    On the basis of the above assumptions, the economic rate of return (ERR) of the whole project&#13;
is estimated at 23.9% (Table 18). The ERRs of sub-projects are all favorable, ranging from 13.7% for&#13;
SRBC to 30.9% and 35.8% respectively for the SRSP above LMD and below LMD commands and&#13;
33.7% for the SRSP sub-project as a whole (Tables22-26). The net present value (NPV) at the discount&#13;
rate of 12% is estimated at Rs.12,280 million for the whole project. The results are summarized in the&#13;
following table:&#13;

37.   Impact of Sunk Costs. The expenditures incurred under AP II, including expenditures&#13;
incurred after its closure up to February 1995, amounted to Rs.264.0 million and Rs. 600.4 million&#13;
respectively for the above and below LMD commands of SRSP and Rs. 3,822.2 million for SRBC.&#13;
Restated in 1995 constant prices and in economic terms, all expenditures of AP II would be Rs.215.9&#13;
million for the above LMD command, Rs.566.2 million for the below LMD command and Rs.3,623.0&#13;
million for SRBC. As shown in the above table, with inclusion of AP II sunk costs, the ERRs of the&#13;
individual commands would fall to 35.0% and 27.5% for the for the above LMD command and below&#13;
LMD commands of SRSP, and to 9.2% for SRBC. The ERRs of the combined SRSP and the whole&#13;
project would fall to 31.4% and 18.7% respectively. Although not strictly relevant to the investment&#13;
decision for the project, these results indicate completion of the project would be justified including the&#13;
full costs of the AP II project.&#13;
Sensitivity Analyses&#13;
38.    Switching Values. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effect of deviations&#13;
from the main assumptions on the economic viability of the project. The measure of sensitivity used, "&#13;
the switching value" is the value of the variable tested which would reduce the present value of the&#13;
project's net incremental benefits to zero when discounted at a capital opportunity cost of 12%. The&#13;
analysis results indicate that, except for the SRBC sub-project which has comparatively low switching&#13;
values, ERRs of the above and below LMD commands of SRSP are neither sensitive to substantial&#13;
increases in the total costs, nor to substantial decreases in incremental benefits.&#13;
39.    The ERRs of the two SRSP commands would fall to 12% when the total costs increased by&#13;
278%-309%, or incremental net benefits decreased by 74%-76%. Because of the relatively high&#13;
completion costs and small benefited areas of SRBC, its ERR would fall to 12% when the total costs&#13;
increased by 19%, or incremental net benefits decreased by 16%. ERRs of the whole project would fall&#13;
to 12% when the total costs increased by 160% respectively, or incremental net benefits decreased by&#13;
62%. The switching values are summarized below:&#13;

implementation and operational risks (para. 16). The results are given in the following table:&#13;

41.    Implementation Delays. Shortage of counterpart funds and/or contractual problems could be&#13;
potential risk causing delays in the implementation schedule. This would result in the increases in the&#13;
construction costs and delay the project's expected benefits. The sensitivity analyses undertaken on the&#13;
above variables show that ERRs would still be acceptable for the combined SRSP and the whole&#13;
project. However, ERRs of command areas are more sensitive to delayed benefits than to increased&#13;
construction costs. The above LMD command is more sensitive to the below LMD command in this&#13;
respect--especially if benefits are delayed two years--but still remains well above the cutoff ERR.&#13;
SRBC, however, becomes marginal if benefits are lagged by two years. Increases in the construction&#13;
costs by 20% would only reduce ERRs of SRSP sub-projects slightly but brings the ERR of SRBC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 12 of 39&#13;
close to 12%. A combination of 20% increases in the construction costs and benefits lagged by two&#13;
years would reduce ERRs by 3.6%-12.4% for sub-project commands and 6.8% for the whole project.&#13;
In this case, the ERR for SRBC would drop to 10%. These results indicate that the project is robust&#13;
provided that implementation is properly managed to contain cost escalation and implementation delay.&#13;
42.    Reduced Seasonal Water Availability. Reduced seasonal water availability is always a&#13;
potential risk for an irrigation project planned with an overall water supply reliability target of 75% (the&#13;
irrigation project standard for India). Reduction in irrigation water supply would result in the reduction&#13;
of the projected cropping intensities. Supply reliabilities for each command were selected based on the&#13;
results of the Krishna and Godavari river basin simulation models (Annex **). In the monsoon (kharif)&#13;
season, full irrigation water supply for the above LMD command was found to be available over 85%&#13;
of the time and over 75% of times at the below LMD and SRBC commands. For the analysis, it is&#13;
conservatively assumed that, because of delay in reservoir filling, no water is available for irrigation in&#13;
the kharif season during deficit years. In the post-monsoon (rabi) irrigation season, full irrigation water&#13;
supply was found to be available about 85% of times for the above LMD command and about 75% of&#13;
times at the below LMD and SRBC. When rabi season deficits occur, the analysis assumes that only&#13;
50% of irrigation water supply would be available above LMD and at SRBC. However for SRSP's&#13;
below LMD command, due to the sensitivity of supply reliability to water delivery (Annex $$), it is&#13;
assumed that there would be no rabi water supply during a rabi season deficit year. Thus, in terrms of&#13;
weighted probabilities, the supply probability for the rabi season is 92.5% above LMD, 87.5% at SRBC&#13;
and 75% at below LMD.&#13;
43.    Based on the above assumptions, the net agricultural production benefits at full development&#13;
would reduce by 10% at above LMD, 16% at below LMD and 11% at SRBC. Accordingly, seasonal&#13;
water deficit impacts are found to reduce ERRs by 1.5% for SRBC, 5.5% and 6.7% for below and&#13;
above LMD, and 3.9% for the whole project. These results are probably overstated since: (a) the&#13;
modelled supply reliability for SRBC were based on full future development of the Krishna river basin&#13;
within AP whereas there some uncertainty that full development could be completed in the next 20-25&#13;
years; (b) no allowance was made for production from groundwater irrigation when assuming that&#13;
supply in deficit years would be reduced to 50% and zero respectively above and below LMD; and (c)&#13;
the impact of deficit years has been assumed to be extreme as deficits may vary from marginal to large.&#13;
44.    Changes in the Expected Cropping Patterns.  The projected predominantly cash crop&#13;
cropping patterns might not materialize despite enforcement of rotational water supply since farners&#13;
may opt to expand the cultivated areas with paddy particularly in SRSP's above LMD command. As&#13;
the water requirement for paddy is about twice that of upland crops, the dry crop area would be reduced&#13;
and the commands would be partially irrigated. Assuming that the projected paddy areas in both kharif&#13;
and rabi seasons would increase by 50% in all commands, the cash crop areas in both seasons would&#13;
reduce by 46%-73% above LMD, 3%-57% at below LMD and 1%-6% at SRBC3. If this occurs, the&#13;
For above LMD: paddy areas increase from 55,000 ha to 82,500 ha and cash crop areas reduce from&#13;
75,500 ha to 20,500 ha in kharif season; while in the rabi season, paddy areas increase from 28,000 ha to&#13;
42,000 ha and cash crop areas reduce from 61,000 ha to 33,000 ha. At below LMD: paddy areas increase&#13;
from 20,504 ha to 30,760 ha and cash crop areas reduce from 36,168 ha to 15,656 ha in kharif season;&#13;
while paddy areas increase from 1,056 ha to 1,585 ha and cash crop areas reduce from 43,120 ha to&#13;
42,062 ha in the rabi season. For SRBC: paddy areas increase from 2,336 ha to 3,505 ha and cash crop&#13;
areas reduce from 38,675 ha to 36,337 ha in kharif season; and during the rabi season, paddy areas&#13;
increase from 500 ha to 750 ha and cash crop areas reduce from 40,125 ha to 39,625 ha.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 13 of 39&#13;
reduction in the cropping intensity is significant at about 47% at above LMD, but only marginal at&#13;
about 13% at below LMD and only 3% at SRBC.&#13;
45.   Although the per ha financial returns from paddy are more or less equal to those of some cash&#13;
crops (e.g. sunflower, soybean, maize, vegetables and groundnut), the per ha economic returns from&#13;
paddy (expressed in border prices) are about 80% higher than high value cash crops, but 25%-35%&#13;
lower than cotton and seed production. Therefore the economic analysis is not overly sensitive to errors&#13;
in forecasting the paddy area since the substantial reduction in cropping intensity, particularly in above&#13;
LMD command, is partly offset by the higher economic returns from paddy. In terms of production&#13;
benefits, total net production benefits would reduce by 22% at above LMD only 1% at both below&#13;
LMD and SRBC, and the estimated ERRs would reduce from 35.8% to 23.1% for the above LMD&#13;
command, but are likely to remain unchanged for the below LMD and SRBC commands. The&#13;
estimated project ERR would however reduce from 23.9% to 21.0%.&#13;
46.    Possible Over-Estimation of Crop Yields. Although the estimation of crop yields for the&#13;
SRSP WP case was carefully discussed (para. 15), the irrigated paddy yield selected by experts for the&#13;
WP scenario would seem to be relatively high relative to the paddy yields of the WOP scenario. For&#13;
cash crops there is less cause for concern as these crops are largely grown under rainfed conditions at&#13;
present in all sub-project areas: hence WOP case yields are understandably lower than the yields that&#13;
could be achieved with irrigation. However, there is always the risk that all assumed crop yields may&#13;
not be achieved by average farmers because the expected input levels might not be applied, or improved&#13;
seeds, fertilizers and production credits might not always be available.&#13;
47.   Thus, assuming that paddy yields in the WP case are 25% lower than those used for the base&#13;
case analysis, WP net production benefits are reduced by 11% and 6% above and below LMD&#13;
respectively, and only by 1% at SRBC (which has a very small paddy area). Accordingly, the estimated&#13;
ERRs would fall to 29.7%, 29.5% and 13.6% for above LMD, below LMD and SRBC in that order.&#13;
When yields also include a 10% yield reduction for other crops, the reductions in WP net production&#13;
benefits are 20% for above LMD, 17% for below LMD and 14% for SRBC. Thus the estimated ERRs&#13;
would fall to 24.5% for above LMD, 26.2% for below LMD and 11.8% for SRBC. Thus, using&#13;
conservative crop yields, the overall project ERR drops to 21.5%.&#13;

THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL AND FISCAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Public Irrigation Sector Finances&#13;
Public Irrigation Finances&#13;
1.    State Finances. The assured counterpart funding during project implementation, and funding&#13;
for O&amp;M works after construction under the project could potentially be a risk from general fiscal crisis&#13;
in Andhra Pradesh (AP). The fiscal stress has been caused by (a) declining state own revenues; and (b)&#13;
sharp rising unproductive public expenditures on subsidies, poorly targeted welfare programs,&#13;
especially the 2-Rupee rice scheme, and salaries which has crowed out productive expenditures on&#13;
physical and social infrastructures, and non-waged O&amp;M. As a result, the main fiscal and debt&#13;
indicators have deteriorated together with the slow growth performance. The fiscal deficit in the State&#13;
has increased to 3.4% of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in FY95/96and amounted to Rs.22.5&#13;
billion in FY95/96, and is estimated to increase further to about Rs.23.9 billion in FY96/97. The&#13;
debt/GSDP ratio currently stands at about 24% of GSDP.&#13;
2.    In recent years, about 22% of State's total expenditures were financed through borrowings,&#13;
and the share of capital expenditures has been only 15%. Total capital expenditures were Rs. 16.0&#13;
billion in FY95/96, while the revenue expenditures amounted to Rs. 102.0 billion (Table 1). An&#13;
increasing reliance on central loans to finance the State plan expenditures has led to a high level of&#13;
debt relative to the revenues of the State. Expenditures on interest payments alone presently absorbed&#13;
about 16.4% of total State revenue receipts, and the share is projected to increase some 20% of total&#13;
State's revenues and 30% of tax revenues before the end of the decade.&#13;
3.    Irrigation Investment and Revenue Expenditures. Irrigation has been given the highest&#13;
priority in the state's capital budget and comprised about 43% thereof in FY95/96. This amounts to&#13;
20% of the total investment in the state. Because of its high share in the capital stock of the state,&#13;
any inefficiency in the irrigation sector generates an adverse effect on overall efficiency in the&#13;
economy. After peaking at 2.4% of AP's GSDP in 1986/87, public expenditure in the irrigation&#13;
sector declined to 1.2% of GSDP in 1995/96. However, it has remained the third largest sector in&#13;
terms of total budgetary allocations after welfare programs and education. Capital expenditures&#13;
declined from Rs.7.83 billion in FY93/94 to Rs.6.83 billion in FY95/96 while revenue expenditures&#13;
(excluding debt service) declined from Rs.1.93 billion to Rs.1.32 billion in this period. It should be&#13;
noted that the total revenue expenditure also included interest payments . Annual interest payments&#13;
to GOI on irrigation debt increased from Rs.4.04 billion in FY93/94 to Rs.7.22 billion in FY95/96.&#13;
Accordingly, total irrigation sector revenue expenditure increased from Rs. 13.80 billion in FY93/94&#13;
to Rs.15.37 billion in FY95/96. Thus, in FY95/96 debt service amounted to about 85% of total&#13;
sector revenue expenditures and comprised about 38% of total State debt service payments (Table 1).&#13;
l Interest payments are included under the revenue expenditure account and, at the same time, the same&#13;
amount is recorded under the revenue receipt account. This is an accounting transaction or a notional&#13;
payment from ICADD to the State Treasury. Because no actual transaction occurs, this practice distorts&#13;
the fiscal accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I1&#13;

4.     Irrigation Subsidies. Surface and groundwater irrigation subsidies comprise about 6% of&#13;
the state revenue deficit. These subsidies are granted in the form of water and power rates which are&#13;
substantially below the cost of delivery. Water subsidies affect the relatively affluent Coastal Region&#13;
where about 85% of canal schemes are situated. Power subsidies affect the drought-prone upland&#13;
areas of the Telengana and Rayalaseema Regions, where about 80% of wells are located. The&#13;
surface water subsidies (difference between the cost of delivering water, including the interest costs&#13;
of capital invested, and the revenues from it) have reached Rs.7.3 billion in FY95/96, i.e. about 90%&#13;
of the total public expenditure on irrigation and flood control in that year. Agriculture consumes&#13;
more than 40% of the total available power in the state at a price that is about 2-3% of the average&#13;
power production cost. The total agricultural power subsidy amounted to Rs.16.3 billion in 1994/95,&#13;
or 184% of the total public expenditure in the sector.&#13;
5.     Irrigation Revenue Sources. Until 1984, land revenues and water charges were the two main&#13;
revenue sources derived from directly the public irrigation sector. Land revenue was abolished in 1984&#13;
and irrigation water charge revenue has since become the only direct revenue source. A Betterment&#13;
Levy for recovery of capital costs was successfully challenged in the Courts and its collection&#13;
suspended. Direct cost recovery through water charges has been about 0.5% of agricultural value&#13;
added. Revenue from irrigation water charges in FY94/95 accounted for less than 1% of total GSDP,&#13;
and only about 12% and 46% respectively of ICADD's O&amp;M budget requests and actual allocations&#13;
(para. 6). Indirect taxation accounted for 72% of total state tax revenues of which the most important&#13;
was the sales tax on agricultural products which averages 4% of gross output.&#13;
Current O&amp;M Budgets and Water Charge Revenue&#13;
6.     O&amp;M  Budgets. The most pressing financial problem faced by the AP public irrigation&#13;
sector is chronic under-funding of O&amp;M works. This has led to widespread deferred maintenance&#13;
and a decline of the net canal command area from 2.8 million ha in FY90/91 to 2.3 million ha in&#13;
FY94/95 (see table below).&#13;

7.    ICADD's O&amp;M  budget requests for surface irrigation schemes increased from Rs.1.98&#13;
billion (Rs.708/ha) in FY90/91 to Rs.2,91 billion (Rs.1,263/ha) in FY94/95, while actual O&amp;M&#13;
expenditure in this period increased from only Rs.449 million (Rs.160/ha) to Rs.692 million&#13;
(Rs.300/ha). Thus the actual O&amp;M allocation in real terms was kept at only about 24% of the actual&#13;
funds needed for adequate upkeep of the existing irrigation network. The relatively high unit O&amp;M&#13;
expenditures of Rs.300/ha is misleading: about 66% (Rs.200/ha) was spent on repair of the ravages&#13;
of deferred maintenance, while 30% (Rs.90/ha) covered salaries and establishment costs and the&#13;
remainder of 4% was devoted to normal maintenance. The inadequate O&amp;M allocation is the source&#13;
of the "deferred maintenance culture" currently practiced in the irrigation sector and inadequate cost&#13;
recovery is the main cause of under-funding of O&amp;M.&#13;
8.    Irrigation Charges Revenues. Water charge levels for public irrigation schemes are low. The&#13;
present water rates were set in 1988 and have remained unchanged till January 3, 1997 (para. 1 1). The&#13;
rates vary depending on whether land is localized as "Irrigated Wet" (IW) or "Irrigated Dry" (ID).&#13;
When charge assessments are made, rice and sugar-cane are regarded as "Wet Crops"; however if water&#13;
is supplied for rice under rotational (intermittent) water supply where IW land has been de-localized to&#13;
ID, dry crop charges would apply. Farmers benefiting from public minor irrigation are charged lower&#13;
rates than those located within major and medium irrigation schemes because of the higher O&amp;M costs&#13;
of the latter.&#13;
9.     Despite their low levels, canal water charges are generally perceived by farmers as taxes and&#13;
not as user charges for public irrigation services which are generally poor and unreliable. The above&#13;
table shows that FY94/95 water charge revenue collection amounted to Rs.318 million (Rs.106/gross&#13;
irrigated ha). Thus revenue amounted to 78% of the water charge assessment, and only 46% of the&#13;
actual irrigation O&amp;M expenditure of Rs.692 million. Compared to previous years, FY94/95 represents&#13;
a drastic decline in collection efficiency per gross irrigated ha which had increased from over 91% to&#13;
97% in FY93/94.&#13;
Fiscal Reforms in Public Irrigation&#13;
10.    State  Fiscal Adjustment Strategy.   GOAP's counterpart funding  during  project&#13;
implementation, and funding for O&amp;M works after completion of the proposed project could potentially&#13;
be at risk due to the general fiscal crisis in Andhra Pradesh. However, GOAP has begun undertaking&#13;
several fiscal reforms and is engaged in an on-going dialogue with the Bank regarding further fiscal&#13;
2&#13;
adjustments and reforms . Overall fiscal reforms that would be implemented to improve the finances of&#13;
GOAP to bring down the primary deficit to a sustainable level include: (a) enhancement of own tax and&#13;
non-tax revenues by reforming the state tax system and increasing cost recovery; (b) re-prioritizing&#13;
public expenditure and improving its management; and (c) restructuring the public enterprise sector. In&#13;
late 1996, GOAP introduced several measures to ease the severe fiscal crisis including: (i) introduction&#13;
of new tax measures; (ii) reduction in the rice distribution scheme by increasing the issuing price and&#13;
reducing the amount of rice ration; and (iii) enhancement power tariffs including raising the agricultural&#13;
tariff from Rs.0.034/kwh to Rs.0.2/kwh.&#13;

Ordinance on January 3, 1997 to increase seasonal irrigation water charges for major, medium and&#13;
minor schemes. The previous (1998 to 1996) and current charges are shown in the table below.&#13;

B. Cost Recovery Analysis&#13;
Revenue Potential of Increased Water Charges&#13;
12.    Assessable Area for Water Charges. The increased irrigation water charges should have a&#13;
positive fiscal impact and substantially reduce the revenue deficit in the public irrigation sector. Upon&#13;
completion of the proposed project, the assessable net area to which water charges apply would increase&#13;
from 2.135 million ha (including 0.6 million ha of minor irrigation) to 2.453 million ha. The functional&#13;
area of major and medium schemes of about 1.600 million ha (including a functional area of 0.065&#13;
million ha in SRSP) would increase to 1.853 million ha. It is assumed that for existing schemes: (a) the&#13;
cropping intensity of large projects and minor irrigation remains about 125% and about 116%&#13;
respectively; and (b) about 90% of the gross cultivated area remains under wet crops as at present. For&#13;
SRSP and SRBC, it may be assumed that the planned cropping intensity of about 150% would be&#13;
achieved. Using the above assumptions, the assessable areas for water charges would be as follows:&#13;

13.    Projected Water Charge Revenue Assessment. Applying the current water charge rates to&#13;
the various crop type and scheme category areas totaling 3.092 million ha in the above table, the total&#13;
water charge assessment could potentially reach about Rs. 1.35 billion. This amount would be about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 5 of 16&#13;
double the actual O&amp;M expenditures of Rs.692 million in FY94/95 and equal to the sector's revenue&#13;
expenditures of Rs. 1.32 billion in that year. It is also 332% higher that the water charge revenue&#13;
assessment of FY94/95. Achievement of this potential however depends on the water charge collection&#13;
efficiency. As WUA formation for joint management of major and medium projects is now being&#13;
implemented as a matter of GOAP policy, it is expected that 40% of the increased water charges would&#13;
be shared with registered WUAs as an incentive rebate. Thus, there a high likelihood of maintaining a&#13;
high collection efficiency comparable to that of the early 1990s.&#13;
O&amp;M Budget Reform Assumptions&#13;
14.    O&amp;M Budget Increase. Since the net area irrigated continues to decline annually because of&#13;
the O&amp;M funding deficit, a major rehabilitation effort is required to overcome deferred maintenance&#13;
and maintain public irrigation at its current level by increasing O&amp;M budgets. Thus a concomitant&#13;
increase in irrigation O&amp;M expenditures is contemplated to match increase in water revenues. Because&#13;
the predominant crop grown on existing schemes is rice, it is tentatively assumed for the purposes of&#13;
this analysis that the O&amp;M allocation would be Rs.494/ha/year. Assuming that staff costs and overhead&#13;
remain constant at Rs.90/ha, an amount of Rs.304/ha would be available for scheme rehabilitation and&#13;
normal maintenance.&#13;
15.    O&amp;M Burden-Sharing with WUAs. The proposed revenue sharing arrangement (para. 13) is&#13;
predicated on the premise that WvUAs would be responsible for maintenance of minor canal systems&#13;
under their jurisdiction. Based on ICADD computations for the SRSP scheme, it would seem that the&#13;
main canals and headworks comprise about 50% of O&amp;M requirements. Thus, it is tentatively assumed&#13;
that where WUAs manage minor canals in their jurisdiction, only half of the maintenance budget would&#13;
be required by ICADD for the main network, while WUA O&amp;M expenses would be provided by WUA&#13;
members in cash and kind.&#13;
Project Cost Recovery Potential&#13;
16.    Project Rent. For the assessment of the project's farmers ability to pay the increased water&#13;
charge, the Project Rent has been estimated (Table 2). A key assumption with respect to water charges&#13;
is that due to the introduction of rotational water supply, farmers would be charged dry crop water rates&#13;
of Rs.247/ha even if they cultivate rice as they would have to provide supplementary water supply from&#13;
their private wells. Other assumptions about implicit management fees and production risk equivalents&#13;
are given in Table 2. On the basis of the incremental water charges and estimated average farm budgets&#13;
under the "future without project" and "with project" scenarios, the Project Rent for an average project&#13;
farm would be substantial: it could vary from about Rs.9,807/ha to Rs.15,290/ha in SRSP's above and&#13;
below LMD areas respectively and attain Rs.23,783/ha in the SRBC area (Table 2).&#13;
17.    Unit Capital and O&amp;M Costs. The unit capital costs of irrigation works, including on-farm&#13;
development works and physical contingencies but excluding feeder roads, are estimated at&#13;
Rs.26,920/ha (US$770/ha) and Rs.22,520/ha (US$640/ha) in SRSP's above and below LMD areas&#13;
respectively, and at Rs.80,000/ha (US$2,285/ha) in SRBC. The present value of the above capital costs,&#13;
discounted at 12% over 30 years, are Rs.21,781/ha and Rs.18,215/ha respectively above and below&#13;
LMD in SRSP, and Rs.65,554/ha for SRBC. Assuming that GOAP will increase O&amp;M budgets to the&#13;
Project Rent is defined here as the incremental unit net benefit due to the project after deduction of&#13;
appropriate allowances for management and risk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1I&#13;
Page 6 of 16&#13;
highest seasonal level of the new water charge (para.14), annual O&amp;M costs (including staff and&#13;
overhead) are estimated at Rs.494 per ha for both sub-projects. While this amount may be too high in&#13;
the initial years after construction, it has been assumed that the O&amp;M allocation will equal that of the&#13;
sector as a whole within a few years. Since Rs.180/ha is currently spent in the above LMD area of&#13;
SRSP, the incremental O&amp;M expenditure would be Rs.314 per ha. The present value of incremental&#13;
O&amp;M costs is estimated at Rs.2,114/ha for SRSP's above LMD command and Rs.2,793/ha for the&#13;
SRBC and below LMD commands.&#13;
18.    Cost and Rent Recovery Indices. For the assessment of the water charge as a revenue&#13;
generation mechanism for cost recovery for project costs, the project cost and rent recovery indices4&#13;
were computed. Since the project's incremental output would generate incremental agricultural sales&#13;
taxes, these were included in the computation as an indirect source of cost recovery. For the project&#13;
areas, the present and future estimated level of agricultural sale tax revenues per ha of net CCA are&#13;
estimated5 as follows:&#13;

SRBC      Above      Below      SRBC    Above      Below&#13;

19.    The project cost recovery indices in terms of O&amp;M costs and overall project costs are 285%&#13;
and 19% respectively (Table 3) when indirect cost recovery through incremental agricultural sales taxes&#13;
are considered. In terms of water charges and O&amp;M costs only, the cost recovery index is 66% as a&#13;
uniform dry crop water charge of Rs.247/ha/season is used. Thus O&amp;M costs may only be fully&#13;
recovered when all incremental revenue such as sales taxes are considered; however sales taxes are not&#13;
adequate to recover capital costs during the projects economic life of 30 years. Given the reliance of&#13;
GOAP on indirect taxation, the effective rate of cost recovery is probably understated as increased&#13;
agricultural income would generate growth in other sectors of the economy and thus additional tax&#13;
revenue.&#13;
20.    Whereas project rent constitutes about 91% of the present value of incremental project net&#13;
income, the rent recovery index is only 10% (i.e. only 10% of the project rent is recovered through&#13;
water charges and agricultural sales taxes). The rent recovery index on water charges is only about 8%.&#13;
The latter rent recovery index indicates that, if the project net benefits would materialize, there could be&#13;
scope to increase cost recovery further if necessary by raising water charges.&#13;
The Cost Recovery Index is the percentage ratio between unit cost recovery revenues (the incremental&#13;
water charge and agricultural sales tax revenues) and incremental unit irrigation capital and O&amp;M costs.&#13;
The Rent Recovery Index is the percentage ratio between the incremental unit tax and water charge&#13;
revenues and the Project Rent. All amounts are expressed in present values discounted at 12% over 30&#13;
years in constant 1995 prices.&#13;
Assuming one third of cereal and legumes and all cash crops would be marketed and that the incremental&#13;
revenue would be entirely due to the investment in the project.&#13;

C. Financial Sustainability Assessment&#13;
Project Debt Service and Revenue Expenditure Impact&#13;
21.    Impact on State Finances. In line with the India CAS, the incremental fiscal impact of the&#13;
proposed project was analyzed in view of its significant impact on state finances. Excluding past&#13;
project expenditures in FY94/95 and FY95/96 which amounted to 25% and 20% of the sector capital&#13;
expenditures respectively, the proposed project as a whole would incur average annual expenditures6 of&#13;
Rs.2.86 billion of which GOAP's annual average counterpart contribution would be Rs.1.13 billion&#13;
(Table 1). In terms of debt service obligations to GOI, standard on-lending conditions for the project&#13;
would entail an average annual debt service of about Rs.0.801 billion in addition to the current state&#13;
debt service of about Rs.19.26 billion. Assuming that state capital expenditure can be maintained at its&#13;
FY95/96 level of Rs.16 billion, the project would require an increment of about 18% in state capital&#13;
expenditure, and raise state annual debt service by about 4.2% (Table 1). Hence, given the state fiscal&#13;
stress, the increased water charges and the incremental agricultural sales taxes generated by the project&#13;
play a vital role in offsetting project debt service and ensuring revenue for a sustainable O&amp;M budget.&#13;
22.    Impact on Sector Finances. Assuming that, with fiscal reform to reduce the state's current&#13;
fiscal deficit, GOAP could maintain its FY95/96 level of irrigation capital expenditure of Rs.6.83&#13;
billion, the project's annual capital outlay would comprise about 42% of irrigation capital expenditures&#13;
during the project implementation period.  Thus if the sector capital budget is not increased,&#13;
expenditure on other ongoing projects may have to be reduced. In terms of debt service obligations to&#13;
GOI, standard on-lending conditions for the project would increase the current sector average annual&#13;
debt service amount of Rs.7.22 billion by about 11% to Rs.8.02 billion. Assuming that, with fiscal&#13;
reform, the total sector revenue expenditure can be maintained at its FY95/96 level of Rs.8.54 billion,&#13;
the project's annual debt service would comprise about 9.4% of total sector revenue expenditure. Thus&#13;
the increased water charge and indirect cost recovery through incremental agricultural sales tax&#13;
revenues generated by the project are essential to maintaining the irrigation sector's fiscal status quo.&#13;
23.    Annual revenue costs for project O&amp;M after withdrawal of Bank support are estimated to&#13;
amount to Rs. 157.1 million if the full O&amp;M burden remains with GOAP, or Rs.94 million if ICADD&#13;
only bears 60% and the remainder is provided by WUAs7. Thus if sector revenue expenditure remains&#13;
at its FY95/96 level of Rs. 1.32 billion, project O&amp;M costs would comprise about 12% and 7% sector&#13;
revenue expenditure without and with WUA burden sharing respectively. The role of a high water&#13;
charge collection rate to offset the increased revenue expenditures for project O&amp;M is crucial if the&#13;
project is to be physically sustainable.&#13;
24.    Revenue Generation Deficit. Under the revised water charge structure, the project could&#13;
generate a water charge assessment of Rs. 117.8 million and potential agricultural sales tax revenues of&#13;
about Rs.485.6 million. However, the total annual potential revenue of Rs.603.4 million would not be&#13;
adequate to cover the total annual expenditure of Rs.958.1 million consisting of an O&amp;M requirement&#13;
of Rs.157.1 million and annual average debt service of Rs.801 million. The deficit of Rs.354.7 million&#13;
6   Actual annual expenditures are estimated to range from Rs.1.74 billion in FY96/97 to Rs.4.49 billion in&#13;
FY98/99 and fall to Rs.1.72 billion in FY2001/2002.&#13;
Based on a command area of 318,000 ha for both sub-projects and an estimated O&amp;M budget of&#13;
Rs.494/ha. If revenue sharing is instituted whereby 40% of the water charge is retumed to WUAs, it is&#13;
assumed that GOAP will only budget Rs.296/ha for O&amp;M.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1I&#13;
Page 8 of 16&#13;
would have to be covered from general revenues such as agricultural sales taxes from the agricultural&#13;
production of other irrigation projects whose potential annual sales tax revenue is estimated at Rs. 1,101&#13;
million (Table 5). If existing project sales tax revenues are regarded as of means of offsetting the&#13;
annual average sector debt burden of Rs.7,218 million, the project revenue deficit would reduce their&#13;
debt service contribution by about 32%. This deficit actually depends on water charge and sales tax&#13;
collection efficiency and could be larger. These deficits would have to be made up by increased&#13;
revenue generated by other fiscal reforms.&#13;
Required Revenue Collection Efficiency&#13;
25.    Breakeven Collection Efficiency Without WUAs. An analysis was made of the water charge&#13;
collection efficiency required to cover sectoral O&amp;M costs and the project debt service burden&#13;
assuming that ICADD remains responsible for all O&amp;M works and that no revenue sharing is&#13;
introduced. This assumes that there is no statewide management transfer to WUAs who would assume&#13;
part of the O&amp;M expenditure burden in return for revenue sharing rebates on water charges. Under this&#13;
scenario (Table 4): (a) required sector O&amp;M expenditure at Rs.494/ha would be Rs. 1.21 billion; (b)&#13;
sectoral debt service would increase by Rs.0.80 billion due to the project (para. 21); and (c) potential&#13;
water charge assessment for all public irrigation would be Rs.1.35 billion (para.13). Accordingly,&#13;
sectoral O&amp;M costs and incremental project debt service total Rs.2.01 billion. Thus, a water charge&#13;
collection efficiency of 90% would be required to recover 100% of estimated sectoral O&amp;M costs, or&#13;
60% of the sectoral O&amp;M and project average annual debt service (Table 4).&#13;
26.    Estimated agricultural sales tax revenue generated on existing irrigation schemes (Rs.1.10&#13;
billion/year) and the incremental sales tax generated by the project (Rs.0.49 billion/year) would total&#13;
Rs. 1.59 billion per annum (Table 5). Considering both total agricultural sales tax revenue and water&#13;
charge revenues implies that estimated sector O&amp;M costs would still be fully covered if agricultural&#13;
sales tax and water charge collection efficiencies drop to 75% respectively (Table 5). However, sector&#13;
water charges and incremental sales taxes generated by the project are not able to recover the sectoral&#13;
O&amp;M costs and project debt service: There is a 9% shortfall at 100% collection efficiency to a 32%&#13;
shortfall at 75%  collection efficiency.  The amount required for break-even would require a&#13;
contribution of sales tax revenue generated by other irrigation schemes. The percentage required of&#13;
sales tax revenue generated by existing schemes varies from 16% at 100% collection efficiency to 77%&#13;
at 75% collection efficiency (Table 5).&#13;
27.    Breakeven Collection Efficiency with Revenue Sharing and WUAs. An analysis has also&#13;
been made of the fiscal sustainability of the sector on the assumption that revenue sharing in the form of&#13;
a rebate on the increased water charge would serve as an incentive for statewide establishment of&#13;
WUAs in line with GOAP policy. The proposed revenue sharing arrangement between ICADD/GOAP,&#13;
local government (Gram Panchayats) and WUAs would be in the ratio of 50:10:40 and result in a water&#13;
charge revenue assessment of Rs.606 million. It is also tentatively assumed that the ICADD O&amp;M&#13;
budget allocation would be reduced from Rs.494/ha to Rs.247/ha and result in an O&amp;M budget totaling&#13;
Rs.606 million for existing schemes and the proposed project. Under this scenario (Table 6), whereas&#13;
water charge revenue would cover O&amp;M expenditure at a collection efficiency of 90%, only 43% of&#13;
state O&amp;M expenditure and project debt service totaling Rs. 1.41 billion would be recovered by water&#13;
charge revenue alone. If indirect cost recovery via the project's incremental agricultural sale revenue is&#13;
added, recovery of sector O&amp;M costs and project debt service drops from as high as 82% at 100%&#13;
collection efficiency to 625 at a 75% collection efficiency. The requisite percentage contribution of&#13;
agricultural sales taxes generated by other irrigation schemes needed to cover the deficit varies from 2%&#13;
at 100% collection efficiency to about 65% at a 75% collection efficiency (Table 6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 1 I&#13;

Overall Project Fiscal Viability Assessment&#13;
28.    The analysis indicates that the significant fiscal burden of the project may be easily offset&#13;
provided efforts are made to maintain a revised water charge and agricultural sales tax collection&#13;
efficiency of at least 75%. Sustainability in terms of recovery of sector O&amp;M costs could be assured&#13;
even if collection efficiency were to fall to 50%. Joint management of irrigation schemes by&#13;
establishment of WUAs would significantly reduce the O&amp;M burden expenditure burden albeit that a&#13;
significant rebate of water charges is contemplated: the rebate would be used by WUAs towards the&#13;
O&amp;M costs of the network under their control. These rebates are indirectly offset by agricultural sales&#13;
taxes which indirectly contribute to recovery of project debt. The project design has considered fiscal&#13;
risks by requiring the establishment of a Water Charge Review Committee which would periodically&#13;
review water charge assessment and collection and advise govemment of the adjustments required to&#13;
maintain the financial viability of the sector.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT&#13;
Baseline Survey Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
1.    The objective of a baseline survey are twofold: (a) it should provide the necessary&#13;
information to assess the current situation before significant project implementation at field level&#13;
takes place and (b), establish the data base for the project's irrigation development performance&#13;
indicators required to monitor and evaluate project success prior to its closure and preparation of the&#13;
Bank Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Based on the assessment of the current situation,&#13;
the baseline survey would provide simple and low cost performance indicators to monitor project&#13;
success continuously for all sub-project areas. Performance indicators form part of the performance&#13;
review of a particular activity to be measured against specified objectives. The baseline survey and&#13;
the development objective performance indicators is an interdisciplinary product jointly produced by&#13;
irrigation engineers, agricultural scientists/economists, remote sensing specialists, and water resource&#13;
managers.&#13;
2.     The baseline survey also makes use of secondary data sources such as data collected by the&#13;
Revenue Department, Agriculture Department, Bureau of Economic Statistics, social agencies, etc.&#13;
Such data would also include, inter alia: land tenure/farm size distribution, number of "Below&#13;
Poverty Line" families, agricultural sales revenues generated within command area mandals (or other&#13;
convenient Revenue jurisdiction)&#13;
3.     The following list gives examples of possible performance indicators for specific project&#13;
outputs. The necessary information for the indicators should be obtained through the baseline survey&#13;
in order to assess the current situation and develop an estimate of the value of agricultural production&#13;
in the sub-project areas. The list is meant as a suggestion of possible indicators. It is neither&#13;
complete nor do all of the suggested indicators have to be used for the monitoring process.&#13;
(a)    Engineering indicators for operation performance of existing irrigation:&#13;
(i)    actual dates of irrigation versus planned dates of irrigation;&#13;
(ii)   variations in the flow at main canal and distributary heads as a ratio of their&#13;
planned discharges;&#13;
(iii)   variations in the flow at minor canals and their tail clusters as a ratio of their&#13;
planned discharges; and&#13;
(iv)   volume of the water received at the distributary head as a ratio of water&#13;
discharged at the main canal head.&#13;
(b)    Engineering indicators for maintenance performance:&#13;
(i)    actual capacity of main canal and distributaries as a ratio of their design&#13;
capacities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 22 of 23&#13;
(ii)    maintenance cost per kilometer of canal/drain system maintenance broken&#13;
up in 3-4 categories of different ranges of canal sizes;&#13;
(iii)   maintenance cost per hectare of command area;&#13;
(iv)   actual maintenance expenditures versus budget targets; and&#13;
(v)    actual area irrigated as a percentage of planned area (kharif and rabi seasons&#13;
separately).&#13;
(c)    Agricultural production indicators for performance of SRBC and SRSP:&#13;
(i)    command area receiving full, partial and no canal water supplies as a ratio of&#13;
total command;&#13;
(ii)   production of the principal irrigated crops comprising at least 90% of the&#13;
total gross cultivated area under canals, wells and tanks;&#13;
(iii)   changes of crop yields in relation to the previous year;&#13;
(iv)   changes in the cropping pattern in relation to the previous year;&#13;
(v)    changes of farm income in relation to the previous year; and&#13;
(vi)   amount and value of the three or four principal crops as a ratio of water&#13;
deliveries.&#13;
(d)    Remote sensing to indicate performance of scheme completion, rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization investments at a command level:&#13;
(i)    total area under irrigation in each season (differentiated by canals, wells and&#13;
tanks if possible);&#13;
(ii)   changes in the cropping pattern/cropping intensity.&#13;
(e)    Performance indictors for the institutional restructuring of SRSP/CADA:&#13;
(i)    reorganization benchmarks achieved;&#13;
(ii)    programming and budgeting plans formulated and submitted on schedule;&#13;
(iii)   annual training program for SRSP/CADA personnel completed on schedule;&#13;
and&#13;
(iv)   number of senior engineers who received management training.&#13;
(f)    Performance indicator for farmer turnover (WUA) program:&#13;
(i)    number of WUAs established and participating:&#13;
a.     collecting water charges;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 23 of 23&#13;
b.    in joint management with SRSP CADA; and&#13;
c.    taking responsibility for O&amp;M.&#13;
(ii)   amount of funds collected by farmer councils for maintenance work;&#13;
(iii)   number of Distributary Committees involved in scheme management;&#13;
(iv)   number of "laskars" working under WUA control; and&#13;
(g)    number of WUAs having problems in operation and/or control of irrigators with&#13;
access to direct outlets from large canals.&#13;
4.     More detailed baseline field surveys would be conducted by stratified farm and participatory&#13;
rural appraisal survey to determine representative farm models and their net income levels. These&#13;
models would include marginal farmers, small farmers and medium farmers. A representative&#13;
stratified sample would be developed and the same farms would be monitored by a survey prior to&#13;
project completion.&#13;
5.    Appropriately experienced universities and/or research institutions would be chosen in&#13;
consultation with the Bank/IDA, to conduct the work. The survey would be funded as part of the AP&#13;
III project technical assistance provision.&#13;
6.    On completion of the baseline survey, the above monitorable indicators would be&#13;
appropriately modified, and modifications included in ICADD's semi-annual and/or annual reporting&#13;
system as appropriate as part of the Project Performance Indicators. However, farm models would&#13;
only be prepared for the baseline survey, project mid-term review and ICR mission. The baseline&#13;
survey would also form a starting yardstick for ICADD monitoring and evaluation activities and for&#13;
the project's Implementation Completion Report.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
INDIA&#13;
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT&#13;
Criteria for the Selection of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)&#13;
The project would seek NGO participation in various activities related to:  farmer&#13;
organization and beneficiary participation in management, operation and maintenance of irrigation&#13;
systems; and resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected persons. Based on a Terms of&#13;
Reference prepared by the Irrigation &amp; Command Area Development Department (ICADD), ICADD&#13;
would solicit detailed proposals for collaboration from interested NGOs. ICADD would be&#13;
responsible for reviewing the proposals and agreeing on appropriate mechanisms to involve NGOs in&#13;
the project. The selection of the NGOs would be guided by the following criteria:&#13;
(a)    As part of legal requirements, the NGO should be a registered body under the&#13;
relevant State Law. It should regularly maintain its accounting records and have&#13;
properly audited annual statement of income and expenditure;&#13;
(b)    Since the program involves working primarily with small and marginal farmers, it is&#13;
essential that the NGO has a proven track record in community development in the&#13;
agrarian setting. To avoid creating any biases and misconceptions in the minds of&#13;
the people, the NGO should be secular and non-political in the conduct of its field&#13;
activities;&#13;
(c)    As the project requires NGO support for farmer organization activities at many&#13;
diverse locations, NGO's should have adequate numbers of field level staff&#13;
conversant with the local dialect and customs, and having a clear understanding of&#13;
the socioeconomic and political situation of the areas in which they will operate.&#13;
They should also possess excellent communication skills and good rapport with the&#13;
community so as to involve them in their own farmer organization or economic&#13;
rehabilitation;&#13;
(d)    A prior understanding of the concept of an irrigation project and experience in areas&#13;
relevant to the NGO's interest in project participation (for instance, in community&#13;
development, farmer organization, resettlement and rehabilitation, tribal welfare)&#13;
would be desirable. Owing to the nature and extent of the physical coverage of the&#13;
program, each selected NGO will be part of the community organization or R&amp;R&#13;
process. Hence, the NGO should be able to interact smoothly with, and be a part of&#13;
,a team; and&#13;
(e)    Finally, the NGO should have internal stability so as to assure long-term support to&#13;
the project.&#13;

            India - Third Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the Third
            Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project is to complete ongoing
            irrigation development and scheme rehabilitation works begun
            under the Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project (APII),
            and thus realize the potential for increasing agricultural
            productivity and rural incomes in two economically backward
            regions of Andhra Pradesh. The other objectives are: (1)
            pilot implementation of management reforms to improve public
            irrigation performance and to upgrade the government s
            capacity to improve irrigation services and command area
            management; (2) retrospectively mitigating the adverse
            impacts of land acquisition under the APII, and proactively
            provide economic rehabilitation for those families still to
            be affected by completing the Srisailam Right Branch Canal
            Project (SRBC) works; (3) ensuring the safety and
            sustainability of three dams supplying water to the project
            areas; (4) implementing a mandated regional program of
            environmental improvements, safeguards, and natural resource
            conservation; and (5) improving government monitoring and
            evaluation capacity for large irrigation projects. Six
            components are needed to achieve project objectives: (1)
            Irrigation Development and Rehabilitation Works-supporting
            completion of all SRBC civil works begun under   APII; and
            selected civil works under the Sriramasagar Project (SRSP);
            (2) Agricultural Services Programs-applying research and
