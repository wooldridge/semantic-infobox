Global Scaling Up Handwashing is a Water and Sanitation (WSP) project focused&#13;
on applying innovative behavior change approaches to improve handwashing&#13;
with soap behavior among women of reproductive age (ages 15­49) and primary&#13;
school-age children (ages 5­9). It is being implemented by local and national&#13;
governments with technical support from WSP in four countries: Peru, Senegal,&#13;
Tanzania, and Vietnam. For more information, please visit www.wsp.org/&#13;

This Technical Paper is one in a series of knowledge products designed to showcase&#13;
project findings, assessments, and lessons learned in the Global Scaling Up&#13;
Handwashing Project. This paper is conceived as a work in progress to encourage&#13;
the exchange of ideas about development issues. For more information, please&#13;

    Rationale and Aims&#13;
    The overall purpose of the IE is to provide decision makers&#13;
    with a body of rigorous evidence on the effects of the hand-&#13;
    washing and sanitation projects at scale in reference to a set&#13;
    of relevant outcomes. It also aims to generate robust evi-&#13;
    dence on a cross-country basis, understanding how effects&#13;
    vary according to each country's programmatic and geo-&#13;
    graphic contexts and generating knowledge of relevant im-&#13;
    pacts such as child growth and development, child illness,&#13;
    and productivity of mother's time, among others.&#13;
                                                                                A young Vietnamese child&#13;
&#13;
    The studies will provide a better understanding of at-scale&#13;

It is worth noting the limitations of this proxy measure for                       households. Less common, however, was access to a place&#13;

     3.3 Diarrhea, Acute Lower Respiratory&#13;
     Infection, and Anemia Prevalence&#13;
     Recent health histories were obtained from caretakers for all&#13;
     children younger than five in the household. Symptoms&#13;
     that were prompted included fever, cough, congestion, di-&#13;
     arrhea related symptoms, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain&#13;
     or cramps, and refusal to eat. The findings presented below&#13;
     focus on the prevalence of diarrhea and acute lower respira-&#13;
     tory infection in the under five population of the sample.&#13;
&#13;
     Diarrhea was defined as the reported presence of three or&#13;
     more loose or watery stools over a 24-hour period, or one or&#13;
     more stools with blood and/or mucus present in the stool&#13;
     (Baqui et al. 1991) using the symptom data obtained from&#13;
     the child health histories. Acute lower respiratory infection&#13;
     (ALRI) was defined using the clinical case definition of the&#13;
     World Health Organization (WHO 2005), which diagno-&#13;
     ses a child as having an ALRI when he/she presents the fol-&#13;
     lowing symptoms: constant cough or difficulty breathing,&#13;
     and raised respiratory rate (&gt;60 breaths per minute in chil-&#13;
     dren less than 60 days of age, &gt;50 breaths per minute for&#13;
     children between 60 ­ 364 days of age, &gt;40 per minute for&#13;
     children between 1­5 years of age).&#13;

     sure since household asset ownership is a more stable                                                               the VNDHS survey was administered in 2002 and since this&#13;

            Scaling up handwashing behavior : findings
            from the impact evaluation baseline survey in Vietnam
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The goal of global scaling up
            handwashing is to reduce the risk of diarrhea and therefore
            increase household productivity by stimulating and
            sustaining the behavior of handwashing with soap at critical
            times in the lives of 5.4 million people in Peru, Senegal,
            Tanzania, and Vietnam, where the project has been
            implemented to date. The structure of this report proceeds
            as follows: In chapter one author provide an overview of the
            global scaling up handwashing and global scaling up rural
            sanitation projects, as well as background on the
            handwashing project in Vietnam. Chapter two details the
            methodology that underlies the impact evaluation, and
            provides details on the sampling design, sample selection,
            and field work protocols. The baseline findings for general
            household characteristics, handwashing behavior, child
            health, and child growth are presented in depth in chapter
            three. In chapter four authors conclude with a summary of
            the next steps of the impact evaluation study.
