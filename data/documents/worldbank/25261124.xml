Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation in&#13;
Timor-Leste&#13;
Turning Finance into&#13;
Services for the Future&#13;
&amp;#12;This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies, and&#13;
Timor-Leste organizations. The National Directorate of Basic Sanitation, National Directorate for Water, Ministry of Health,&#13;
Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (formerly AusAID) BESIK Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
Program, and Asian Development Bank have been key partners, together with the Water and Sanitation Program, in analyz-&#13;
ing the sector. The authors acknowledge the valuable contributions made by the World Bank Country Management Unit,&#13;
WaterAid, UNICEF, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Cruz Vermelha de Timor-Leste (Red Cross), and National De-&#13;
velopment Agency.&#13;
&#13;
The Task Team Leader for the Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) in East Asia and the Pacific is Susanna Smets. The fol-&#13;
lowing World Bank staff and consultants have contributed to the service delivery assessment process and report: Isabel&#13;
Blackett, Penny Dutton, Sandra Giltner, Arlindo Marcal, Rosalyn Fernandes, Joao dos Martires, Maria Madeira, and Almud&#13;
Weitz. The report was reviewed by Alex Grumbley, Country Representative, WaterAid Timor-Leste and Keryn Clark, Program&#13;
Director, BESIK Water Supply and Sanitation Program Timor-Leste. The report was peer reviewed by the following World&#13;
Bank staff and sector colleagues: Michel Kerf, Sector Manager; Shyam KC, Disaster Risk Management Specialist; Lilian&#13;
Pena Pereira Weiss, Senior Water and Sanitation Specialist; Ansye Sopacua, Sanitation Advisor, BESIK Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation Program; and Allison Woodruff, Urban Development Specialist, Asian Development Bank. Thanks go to Luis&#13;
Constantino, Timor-Leste Country Manager; Towfiqua Hoque, Senior Infrastructure Specialist; and Alexander Jett, Research&#13;
Analyst for providing comments to the report.&#13;
&#13;
The SDA was carried out under the guidance of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s WaÂ­  ter and Sanitation Program and local partners. This re-&#13;
gional work, implemented through a country-led process, draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs conductÂ­ ed in&#13;
more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
An SDA analysis has three main components: a review of past water and sanitation access, a costing model to asÂ­       sess the ad-&#13;
equacy of future investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service deÂ­   livery pathways. SDAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector targets for infrastructure&#13;
and hardware but also what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure that fiÂ­   nance is effectively turned into accelerated&#13;
and sustainable water supply and sanitation service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership, part of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Water Global Practice, sup-&#13;
porting poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s donors&#13;
include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nor-&#13;

Water and sanitation Service Delivery Assessments (SDAs)                          The scorecard looks at nine building blocks of the service&#13;

The SDA analysis has three main components: a review of                           services (facility maintenance, expansion of infrastructure,&#13;
past water and sanitation coverage, a costing model to as-                        use of the service). Each building block is assessed by&#13;
sess the adequacy of future investments, and a scorecard                          stakeholders against usually three specific indicators which&#13;
that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service de-                        are scored from 0 to 1, and then aggregated to provide a&#13;
livery pathway. These components are not directly linked to                       score for that building block of between 0 and 3. (Refer An-&#13;

  According to the JMP, an improved drinking-water source is one that, by the nature of its construction, adequately protects the source from outside&#13;
contamination, particularly fecal matter eg. piped water into dwelling, piped water to yard/plot, public tap or standpipe, tubewell or borehole, protected dug&#13;
well, protected spring, rainwater. An improved sanitation facility is one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact eg. flush toilet, piped&#13;
sewer system, septic tank, flush/pour flush to pit latrine, ventilated improved pit latrine (VIP), pit latrine with slab, composting toilet.&#13;

  Prior to Indonesian withdrawal, AusAID estimated national access rates to improved water supply were around 66% in 1999. Refer: Commonwealth&#13;

 Notes: Investments that do not expand coverage are not included. While there is NGO investment in water supply, it was not possible to determine comprehensively (many small NGOs&#13;
 operate â&#128;&#156;off budgetâ&#128;&#157;). Most NGO expenditure in sanitation, especially in rural sanitation, is non-capital spending, such as technical assistance and capacity development (â&#128;&#156;softwareâ&#128;&#157;).&#13;
 The percentage of estimated requirement is calculated as anticipated government expenditure over total requirements (from Table 2.2). Annual surplus/deficit is the difference between&#13;
 the annual investment required (Table 2.2) and anticipated. Totals may not add up due to rounding. Source: SDA estimates based on information supplied by government, development&#13;
 partners, and NGOs.&#13;

  Some cash incentive programs exist, for example Red Cross provides a cash incentive of $20 as a reward for a select few households who have developed&#13;
an understanding of hygiene as part of its integrated water, sanitation, hygiene, disaster preparedness, and livelihoods program, however this is very small&#13;
scale and does not cover the cost of sanitation hardware.&#13;

  Within the Ministry of Public Works the Directorate General for Water and Sanitation has three directorates: water supply (DNSA), basic sanitation (DNSB),&#13;
and water quality and control/water resources (DNCQA). In 2011 DNSB was elevated to a separate directorate, equivalent to DNSA, previously being a unit&#13;
under the former National Directorate for Water and Sanitation (DNSAS).&#13;

 does not reach district levels on a timely basis (e.g. guide-                        or consumer accountability, and in effect DNSA regulates&#13;
 lines, decisions, outcomes).47 District staff reported feeling                       itself. The autonomy of service providers to retain tariffs is&#13;
 abandoned and ignored.48 District level skills and coordi-                           essential in establishing a commercial utility approach as a&#13;

 Because DNSA operates as a government department it has&#13;
 limited autonomy in decision making, other than for basic op-                        In the rural sector, a key issue is the unclear asset owner-&#13;

 Group at national level. Coordination between stakehold-&#13;
 ers at district level is however not formalized. Previously,&#13;
 weekly infrastructure round table meetings of development&#13;
 partners provided an opportunity to share activities, issues&#13;
 and solutions. However these ceased when the ADB initia-&#13;

 Capacity shortfall&#13;
&#13;
 Timor-Leste in general has a shortfall of skilled personnel&#13;
 across many sectors, including WASH. Increased resources&#13;
 and capacity are needed in all subsectors of WASH. For&#13;
 example, DNSB has gone very rapidly from a department&#13;
 to a national directorate. Human resources are especially&#13;
 needed in rural water supply and rural sanitation if targets&#13;
 are to be met.58 Simply to meet the MDG targets, there is&#13;
 demand for an estimated 25 to 70 engineers and 120 to just&#13;

   PDD1 and PDD2 include funding for water supply in communities that are classified as â&#128;&#156;urbanâ&#128;&#157;. Despite their small populations, district capitals in Timor-&#13;
 Leste are generally classified as â&#128;&#156;urbanâ&#128;&#157; even though modes of water supply and sanitation delivery may more typically be â&#128;&#156;ruralâ&#128;&#157; (small piped systems, wells,&#13;
 onsite sanitation). The sanitation in these funds is typically public sanitation on the Indonesian MCK or MCK-plus model, but there seems to be some minor&#13;
 funding of household sanitation.&#13;

      Priority actions for rural water supply&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Establish clear policies and define government and community responsibilities for O&amp;M of rural water systems.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Ensure budget is available for technical support systems for O&amp;M services of community-managed schemes.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Increase functionality of water supply schemes by a) improving the spare parts supply chain, b) increasing numbers and&#13;
         skills of technical staff in districts, and c) professionalizing management of rural water supply through contracting of&#13;
         NGOs and the private sector.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Make district budgets transparent to show water supply funding from DNSA, decentralized projects, development part-&#13;
         ners and NGOs.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Finalize community engagement processes to improve community involvement in water supply scheme development&#13;
         and operation, and harmonize approaches with decentralized projects.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Develop and enforce legislation that is sensitive to traditional customs in order to protect springs and other water re-&#13;

The sustaining pillar of the urban water service delivery                          DNSA to retain and control revenues rather than the Ministry&#13;

&#13;
 The estimates of operations and maintenance costs are de-&#13;
 rived from averaging a set percentage of existing technolo-&#13;
 gies and expected future technologies to get an average&#13;
 cost. These are assumed to be 3% of the capital cost for&#13;
 water supply piped onto premises or public taps, and 1.5%&#13;
 of the capital cost of other types of water supply technolo-&#13;
 gies. For sanitation, the estimate is 3% of the capital cost&#13;
 for networked sewerage and for pour flush/flush into tanks&#13;
 or pits, and 1.5% for other technologies. When estimating&#13;
 O&amp;M costs, there is no distinction between urban and rural&#13;
 sanitation and water supply, however total O&amp;M costs (in&#13;
 Table A2.6) are pro-rated according to the predicted tech-&#13;
 nology distribution for 2020.&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Timor-Leste
            : turning finance into services for the future
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Water and sanitation Service Delivery
            Assessments (SDAs) are taking place in seven countries in
            East Asia and the Pacific region under the guidance of the
            World Banks Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and local
            partners. This regional work, implemented through a
            country-led process, draws on experience of water and
            sanitation SDAs conducted in more than 40 countries in
            Africa, Latin America and South Asia. The SDA analysis has
            three main components: a review of past water and sanitation
            coverage, a costing model to assess the adequacy of future
            investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of
            bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway. These
            components are not directly linked to each other, but in
            combination they produce a picture of the country WASH
            status and critical issues in the sector. The SDA
            contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and
            future finance is sufficient to meet sector targets for
            infrastructure and hardware, but what specific issues or
            bottle necks need to be addressed to ensure finance is
            effectively turned into accelerated and sustainable water
            supply and sanitation service delivery. Bottlenecks can
            occur throughout the service delivery pathway all the
            institutions, processes and actors that translate sector
            funding into sustainable services. Where the pathway is well
            developed, sector funding should turn into services at the
            estimated unit costs. Where the pathway is not well
            developed, the capital investment requirements to achieve
            targets may be gross underestimates as additional finance
            may be needed to unblock the service delivery bottlenecks
            such as developing institutional capacity and improving sustainabilty.
