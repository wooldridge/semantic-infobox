Investigating Options for&#13;
Self-help Water Supply&#13;
From field research to pilot interventions in Uganda&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
This field note outlines the findings of an investigation into experiences of self-help water supply&#13;
improvements in Uganda. It makes recommendations on how water supply professionals can best&#13;
engage with communities to achieve sustainable supplies, briefly describing a recently-started pilot&#13;
project supporting self-supply options.&#13;

Executive Summary&#13;
                                                                                  Map of Uganda&#13;

Self-supply of water is one of the three flagship themes of the Rural Water&#13;
Supply Network (RWSN). In 2005 an investigation was undertaken into&#13;
self-supply improvements to water supplies in south and east Uganda.&#13;
It was found that as much as 39 percent of the rural population relied on&#13;
self-supply sources, ranging from very shallow unlined water holes, to&#13;
drilled boreholes fitted with a range of water-lifting devices.This field note&#13;
examines the strengths and drawbacks of the conventional externally-driven&#13;
approach to supporting water self supply. It suggests a complementary&#13;
approach, which is likely to be more sustainable because it is more&#13;
responsive to on-the-ground technical, social and economic realities.The&#13;
field note outlines the implications of such an approach for policy, and&#13;
suggests steps that can be taken towards its full-scale implementation.&#13;

In sub-Saharan Africa, households&#13;
and communities have taken their&#13;

an estimated one million self-supply&#13;

initiatives, which may already serve&#13;

Uses of water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Out of the 67 water sources visited the&#13;
vast majority (80 percent) exist primarily&#13;
for domestic water use. There was&#13;
evidence in some cases that consumers&#13;
use low-quality sources for bathing&#13;
and laundry, and improved (typically&#13;
handpump or tap water) sources for&#13;
drinking and cooking. But in many cases&#13;
a single source may supply all domestic&#13;
functions, with recourse to a more&#13;
distant, reliable, protected source when&#13;
the nearby source dries up. It should be&#13;
noted that convenience of access is of&#13;
significantly greater importance to most&#13;
(especially rural) consumers than water&#13;
quality; while for sector professionals&#13;
objectionable quality alone (by&#13;
appearance or testing) can be enough to&#13;
condemn a source.                                     Distance is a limiting factor when scoring water sources for reliability and cost&#13;

         Self-supply sources were&#13;

         convenience and timesaving, but&#13;
         also the opportunity to use greater&#13;
         quantities of water. The downside&#13;
         of many self-supply shallow well&#13;
         sources relates to the quality of&#13;
         construction and their location&#13;

            This field note outlines the findings of
            an investigation into experiences of self-help water supply
            improvements in Uganda. It makes recommendations on how
            water supply professionals can best engage with communities
            to achieve sustainable supplies, briefly describing a
            recently-started pilot project supporting self-supply options.
