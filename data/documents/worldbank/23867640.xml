Enabling Infrastructure Investment&#13;
DECEMBER 2014&#13;
PPIAF Supports the Institutional and&#13;
Policy Environment for PPPs in Jordan&#13;
PPIAF has supported the Government of Jordan to improve the institutional and policy&#13;
environment for public-private partnerships (PPPs). The objective is to provide the enabling&#13;
conditions for the development of a PPP program that seeks to improve and expand access&#13;
to infrastructure services to the people of Jordan. The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory&#13;
Facility (PPIAF) provided funding in 2013 to support the definition and establishment of&#13;
a PPP Unit within the Ministry of Finance, provide recommendations to improve the legal&#13;
and regulatory framework for PPPs, draft a PPP policy, and identify a pipeline of priority&#13;
PPP projects. As a result of the PPIAF support, the PPP Unit has been established based&#13;
on the recommended organizational structure. In addition, a new PPP Law passed through&#13;
Parliament and was ratified on November 2, 2014.&#13;
Since 1994, Jordan has achieved financial closure on 17 PPPs with combined investment of $6.6 billion across&#13;
core infrastructure sectors. Nevertheless, given the infrastructure deficit in Jordan, there is substantial scope&#13;
for additional PPPs to improve public services and generate fiscal savings across core infrastructure sectors,&#13;
municipal services, health, education, and facilities management.&#13;
In order to expand Jordan's PPP program, the need for improvements to the institutional and legal&#13;
environment for PPPs were identified. While PPPs have proceeded under some sector-specific laws (e.g.,&#13;
electricity) or Jordan's general privatization law (from 2000), the Government of Jordan (GoJ) through&#13;
the Executive Privatization Commission (EPC) concluded that a special-purpose PPP Law was needed to&#13;
address certain legal ambiguities (e.g., authority of private developers to collect government fees, step-in&#13;
rights for lenders) and place Jordan's PPP program on a more certain legislative footing. Hence, in June&#13;
2011, the GoJ approved a draft PPP law, but despite submitting it to Parliament for approval on a priority&#13;
basis, the law was not passed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Despite the lack of legislative progress, in December 2012,  Identification of a pipeline of potential PP projects:&#13;
the Minister of Finance announced his intention to improve  - Consultation with line ministries and other stakeholders to&#13;

was in this context that the Go] approached PPIAF, via the World&#13;
Bank, to provide catalytic support to its PPP program.&#13;

In early 2013 the GoJ requested support from PPIAF to provide  the activity progresses. The PPP Unit has been established within&#13;

Following the request, PPIAF provided multiple areas of technical  recommended by PPIAF. In addition, the preparation of a new&#13;
assistance, including:                                   draft of the PPP Law was supported under this activity, and the&#13;
new PFP Law has since been passed by the Jordanian Farliament&#13;

- Review of current laws, procedures and regulations to identify  PFF policy has been drafted, and it is expected that this will be&#13;
gaps and overlaps to be addressed in the definition of the PFP  adopted and launched by the PP Unit in early 2015. A second&#13;
Unit mandate and the new draft PPP Law (also re-drafted as  phase activity to support the further operationalization of the&#13;
