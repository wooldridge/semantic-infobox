1. TRANSPORT BOTTLENECKS AND REFORMS,&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   The transport system in China has grown considerably over the last four decades.&#13;
Since 1952, the length of the highway system increased by a factor of nine and the length&#13;
of the railway network more than doubled. Despite this development, the transport&#13;
network is one of the sparsest in the world compared with the area and population it&#13;
serves.&#13;
B. TRAFFIC&#13;
1.2   China had experienced rapid growth of traffic during 1980-89 when the economy&#13;
grew at an average annual rate of 9.5 percent. Traffic growth declined when the&#13;
economic growth slowed down during 1989-90, as the supply constraints became more&#13;
conspicuous. However, resumption of high economic growth since 1991 has brought&#13;
about a corresponding surge in transport demand.&#13;
1.3   Traffic Growth.  Despite the capacity constraints and related bottlenecks,&#13;
between 1980 and 1994 the ton-km of freight have grown at 7.5 percent per year and the&#13;
passenger-kilometers at 9.9 percent per year. Highway freight traffic grew at the highest&#13;
annual rate of 13.5 percent, compared with 5.7 percent for railway traffic and 8.4 percent&#13;
for coastal and inland waterway traffic. Despite its rapid growth, intercity passenger&#13;
travel per capita in China remains very low, at about two thirds of the level for India.&#13;
Civil aviation traffic is rapidly expanding and has grown 20.3 percent per year since&#13;
1980, but still represents a small share of total traffic with most long-distance journeys&#13;
made by rail (Table 1.1).&#13;
1.4   Transport Demand and Modal Split Trends. Although the railway's share of&#13;
traffic has declined over the last decade as the share of road traffic has grown, rail transport&#13;
still dominates freight and passenger traffic in China. In 1994, 37.5 percent of freight and&#13;
44.3 percent of passenger traffic turnover were attributable to rail, with the remainder&#13;
moved by road, inland waterway, coastal shipping, pipeline, and civil aviation.&#13;
C. TRANSPORT REFORMS&#13;
1.5   In the past decade, China's economic reforms have aimed to increase economic&#13;
efficiency through measures designed to reduce national government intervention in the&#13;
This chapter is an abstract of the Bank report (No. 1 1819-CHA) China Highway Development and Management&#13;
Issues, Options and Strategies, February 1994.&#13;
&#13;

production and distribution process, reduce the Government's deficits and subsidies to&#13;
state-owned enterprises, and open the economy by expanding trade and allowing further&#13;
participation of private and collective enterprises.&#13;
1.6   These initiatives are helping to spur the growth and modernization of the transport&#13;
system. To alleviate the transport bottlenecks and rationalize the transport system, the&#13;
Government will need to take the following measures by the year 2000:&#13;
(a)   increase the total level of transport investment in relation to GNP, to expand&#13;
capacity to meet the new traffic demands and to clear up the backlogs&#13;
caused by past underinvestment;&#13;
(b)   aim for balanced investments among the major freight transport modes of&#13;
railways, highways, and waterways in terms of optimal economic cost of&#13;
transport;&#13;
(c)   realign further the prices of freight transport services and those of the major&#13;
commodities, especially coal, to bring them closer to their real costs;&#13;
(d)   increase further the productivity of existing transport assets through&#13;
technological modernization and management reforms; and&#13;
(e)   improve and expand the multimodal transport system, both across and&#13;
within modes, with particular emphasis on more extensive use of containers.&#13;
D. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR&#13;
The National Highway Network and its Utilization&#13;
1.7   China's road network consists mainly of aging roads with neither the capacity nor&#13;
strength to carry current and projected future traffic. Many of the roads need upgrading&#13;
in addition to normal maintenance and rehabilitation. A Bank policy study on road&#13;
deterioration in developing countries classified China among the countries with an&#13;
extensive and obsolete road network in need of modernization to meet the rapid growth in&#13;
road transport demand. Its outmoded maintenance technology would not be sufficient to&#13;
arrest the accelerated deterioration of the aging road system network. China needs to&#13;
mobilize domestic and external resources for modernizing its road system.&#13;
1.8   The rapid growth of highway traffic stems not only from the country's rapid&#13;
economic growth but also from other factors such as the national policy of shifting short-&#13;
haul transport from rail to road as well as the expansion of the service sector and rural&#13;
industries. Furthermore, with the increase in foreign trade, growth in transport demand&#13;
will be concentrated in transport corridors serving the main ports and their hinterlands&#13;
and, with containerization of higher-value commodities, most domestic movements of&#13;
this foreign trade are expected to go by road.&#13;
1.9   Growth in the truck and bus fleet has been fairly steady at an average annual rate of&#13;
12.3 percent over the last 12 years, with particularly strong growth in small passenger&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vehicles.  Growth in the tractor and motorcycle fleets has increased sharply, with&#13;
motorcycles showing the strongest growth of all vehicle types. The tractor and motorcycle&#13;
fleets, at 5.4 million and 6.5 million respectively, well exceed the size of the truck and bus&#13;
fleet. Tractors and motorcycles contribute significantly to traffic congestion and are among&#13;
the major causes of road accidents.&#13;
1.10  The trucking industry consists of publicly-owned trucks operated by trucking&#13;
companies affiliated with local (provincial or district) highway authorities, and other trucks&#13;
operated by factories, cooperative organizations and, recently, private individuals. The&#13;
relaxation of trucking regulations in the early 1980s allowed own-account trucks to haul&#13;
cargo for other factories and cooperatives and thus promoted competition between public&#13;
and own-account trucks. Market forces are expected to play a more important role in&#13;
shaping the industry in the future.&#13;
1.11   Road safety is an important issue in the development of China's road sector, as&#13;
traffic continues to grow rapidly on all roads and a high-speed, national highway network&#13;
is developed. The frequency and numbers of people involved in traffic accidents have&#13;
reached serious proportions in China. The annual fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles in&#13;
China is 46, as compared with rates of 33 in India, 12 in Indonesia, 9 in Thailand, and 2&#13;
in the United States, and the United Kingdom (Table 1.2). However, the annual fatality&#13;
rate per 100,000 population in China is the same or less than that for developed countries.&#13;
This reflects the low motorization rates (vehicles per 1,000 population) in China.. The&#13;
social and economic costs of these accidents to the Chinese economy reached almost $1&#13;
billion annually.2&#13;
1.12  Responsibility for highway safety matters was transferred from the Ministry of&#13;
Communications (MOC) and the provincial Communications Departments to the Ministry&#13;
of Public Security and its provincial units in 1988. This decision created transitional&#13;
administrative problems. Cooperation between the provincial highway administration&#13;
bureaus and the concemed public security units is still weak. The Bank-financed Xinjiang&#13;
Highway Project (Loan 3787) and the Guangdong Provincial Highway Project (Loan 3530)&#13;
contain pilot programs that address the traffic accident black spot problem.&#13;
Highway Administration, Planning and Finance&#13;
1. 13  Administration of the highway network is the responsibility of the provincial&#13;
governments, through the Highways Bureaus of the Provincial Communications&#13;
Departments. The central government's MOC provides general policy guidance and&#13;
support to the provinces through its nationwide policies and regulations, specifying&#13;
design  and  construction  standards.   However, the Provincial Communications&#13;
Departments are financially independent of MOC and carry out all road planning,&#13;
construction, maintenance, and operation of roads and waterways in the provinces.&#13;
2  The costs analyzed in this case included loss of life, injury, property damage, reduced productivity, and medical,&#13;
funeral, and legal costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.14   While the provinces manage the country's highway network, MOC is responsible&#13;
for planning and investment strategies for the development of the National Highway&#13;
System. MOC has been evolving a long-term strategy for the systematic upgrading of the&#13;
national system in key corridors over a 30-year planning horizon. Known as the National&#13;
Trunk Highway System (NTHS), the system, comprising 12 major roads for the exclusive&#13;
use of motor vehicles (Map IBRD 27621) would connect all the provincial capitals and&#13;
cities with populations exceeding 500,000. Development of the NTHS has been accorded&#13;
highest priority in investment planning for the highway sector.  Priority for early&#13;
construction is being given to two north-south corridors (Beijing-Zhuhai and Tongjiang-&#13;
Harbin-Shenyang-Qingdao-Shanghai-Fuzhou-Guangzhou-Sanya); two east-west corridors&#13;
(Lianyungang-Zhengzhou-Xian-Lanzhou-Urumqi-Houerguosi  and   Shanghai-Nanjing-&#13;
Jiujiang-Wuhan-Chengdu) and the three corridors of Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Shenyang&#13;
and Chongqing-Behai, and to those routes already identified as congested and hindering&#13;
economic activity.&#13;
1.15   A system for funding highway construction and maintenance is well established.&#13;
The main revenues are generated by the Road Maintenance Fee (RMF), typically levied on&#13;
the revenue of freight and passenger transport companies and on the capacity of own-&#13;
account vehicles. The RMF is levied by the provinces who retain the majority of the&#13;
monies after remitting a portion to Central Government agencies. MOC also directly&#13;
receives revenues from the Added Vehicle Purchase Fee, a supplementary earmarked tax on&#13;
vehicle imports and sales, and uses these funds, which currently reach about&#13;
Y 2 billion/year, to contribute financing for: (a) the roads included in the national highway&#13;
network, providing a higher share of financing for the poorer, inland provinces and a lower&#13;
share for the richer, coastal provinces, and (b) construction or rehabilitation of rural roads&#13;
located in economically less-developed areas.&#13;
E. BANK GROUP PARTICIPATION&#13;
1.16   The Bank Group has supported initiatives by the Government in the transport&#13;
sector through loans and credits totaling $5.6 billion for 34 projects (Table 1.3). The&#13;
various studies under the Bank-financed projects have, inter alia, emphasized the areas of&#13;
multimodal transport investment and the setting of sectoral priorities based on&#13;
systemwide economic evaluation techniques.3&#13;

1.17   Recent Bank Group reports on the transport sector include China's Railway&#13;
Strategy (No. 10592-CHA, February 1993), Highway Development and Management:&#13;
3   Six of the studies have explored multimodal pricing and investment issues in a more comprehensive and more&#13;
economically oriented analytical framework than was formerly available to China's decisionmakers: the&#13;
Guangdong Comprehensive Transport Planning Study (GCTPS); the Yangtze Economic Zone Transport Study&#13;
(YEZTS); the Coal Transport Study (CTS); the Railway Investment Study (RIS); the Southeast Coastal Region&#13;
Strategic Issues in Ports and Shipping Development Study (SIPS); and the Price Reform Study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Issues, Options and Strategies (No. 1181 9-CHA, February 1994), and Strategies for Road&#13;
Freight Development (No. 12600-CHA, January 1995). In addition, studies on the&#13;
trucking industry and highway financing have been completed under ongoing projects, a&#13;
study of the provincial road construction industry is being undertaken under the Fujian&#13;
Provincial Highway Project, a study of interprovincial traffic facilitation and a highway&#13;
capacity study are being undertaken under the National Highway Project (Hebei/Henan),&#13;
a study of intercity passenger transport is being carried out under the Xinjiang Highway&#13;
Project, and a study of highway maintenance is included in the Second Shaanxi&#13;
Provincial Highway Project. In addition, a study for improved prioritization of highway&#13;
investments and improved highway feasibility study methodology has been completed by&#13;
January 1996. The Bank Group also conducted a survey of the national water transport&#13;
system in the mid-1980s, which has reaffirmed the need to further exploit the large&#13;
potential of the Chinese waterways. Chinese authorities and the Bank Group are currently&#13;
preparing a comprehensive transport sector strategy paper that is expected to help guide&#13;
sector development in a consistent, cohesive policy framework.&#13;
The Bank's Experience and Strategy in Highways&#13;
1.18  Of the 13 Bank-assisted highway projects in China, two have so far been&#13;
completed (the First Highway Project and the Shaanxi Highway Project). The former&#13;
project achieved its original objectives and demonstrated the benefits of improved&#13;
accessibility to economically less-developed regions.  Furthermore, the Bank's&#13;
involvement facilitated the acceptance of competition in the contracting for road works in&#13;
preference to force account operations.&#13;
1.19 The Bank strategy for highway lending in the medium term is detailed in Highway&#13;
Development and Management: Issues, Options and Strategies. The strategy is to continue&#13;
supporting institutional development and sectoral reforms aimed at modernizing the&#13;
highway system and its management, and supporting investments focused on high-priority&#13;
links of the NTHS and the provincial road networks that feed into it.&#13;
1.20  While some institutional development and sectoral reform  components will&#13;
normally be included in every project, specific issues identified during the Bank's dialogue&#13;
with the government, will be addressed selectively in individual provincial projects. During&#13;
the next few years, the projects' investment components will continue to focus on high-&#13;
priority links of the national highway system and support the development of the provincial&#13;
road networks.&#13;
F. LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS BANK OPERATIONS&#13;
1.21  Previous highway projects in China emphasize the importance of rigorous, early&#13;
preparation for major civil, and electrical and mechanical works and for procurement&#13;
processes, where tendering often takes longer than expected. Advance preparation of&#13;
bidding documentation and independent design reviews have also fostered smooth&#13;
implementation and have helped reduce variations during the implementation period.&#13;
The  design  of  electrical  and  mechanical  facilities  (traffic  monitoring,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
telecommunications, tolling and lighting) must be advanced so that these works would be&#13;
finished shortly after completion of the civil works for high-grade highways.&#13;
1.22  Land acquisition and resettlement of affected people have also led to&#13;
implementation difficulties, including delays, in Chinese highway projects.  The&#13;
institutional requirements for resettlement of a large number of people are significant;&#13;
under the proposed project, resettlement has received considerable attention to ensure&#13;
institutional capability to provide adequate compensation and to implement Resettlement&#13;
Action Plans.&#13;
1.23  Experience in the environmental area in China has generally been favorable.&#13;
However, more attention should be paid to environmental supervision during&#13;
construction, training of environmental personnel, and environmental monitoring during&#13;
both the construction and operation phases.&#13;
1.24  Bank experience emphasizes the importance of adequate construction quality of&#13;
roads. Construction quality has also been highlighted as a sector issue for Bank highway&#13;
projects.  Effective remedial actions include careful formulation of supervision&#13;
arrangements, including engagement of foreign experts, training of local supervision staff&#13;
and equipping the supervision teams with the necessary laboratory equipment, surveying&#13;
instruments, transportation and telecommunications facilities.&#13;
1.25 There is a growing concern that adequate funding for highway maintenance is not&#13;
now being generated to cover an expanding and more expensive highway system.&#13;
Experience with rural highways in Africa and South Asia and with the Bank's Shaanxi&#13;
Highway Project in China has shown that provision of basic access through all-weather&#13;
roads and provision of nonnotorized transport are effective means of reducing poverty in&#13;
rural areas, especially when combined with programs for socioeconomic development.&#13;
1.26 Based on the Bank's experience with institutional and policy aspects of highway&#13;
projects, the phasing of studies and technical assistance and the intensity of Bank&#13;
supervision are important for positive, sustainable outcomes. Systematic supervision and&#13;
follow-up of the findings of studies and technical assistance components by Bank&#13;
missions also enhance project outcomes. Ultimately, the success of the road safety&#13;
component of the project depends upon the Borrower's commitment to the objectives of&#13;
the component and its ability to ensure effective coordination between the Public Security&#13;
Bureau (Traffic Police) and the Highway Department-the main two agencies involved&#13;
in the implementation of this component.&#13;

2. XINJIANG UYGUR AUTONOMOUS REGION&#13;
TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. SITUATION AND ECONOMY&#13;
2.1   Xinjiang is the largest of China's provinces and autonomous regions, with a land&#13;
of 1.6 million km2 (15 percent of China's total land area). The Xinjiang Uygur&#13;
Autonomous Region (XAR) is surrounded locally by Gansu and Qinghai Provinces and&#13;
the Tibet Autonomous Region and eight foreign countries-Mongolia, Russia,&#13;
Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India (see Map IBRD&#13;
27622). The climate is harsh, very cold in winter and hot in summer, with an annual&#13;
rainfall of only 150 mm. Xinjiang's current population is about 16.3 million (1.36&#13;
2&#13;
percent of China's total). The average population density is a low 10.2 persons/km (8&#13;
percent of China's average). About 48 percent of the population in Xinjiang is urbanized;&#13;
its capital Urumqi, has a population of about 1.4 million.&#13;
2.2   Xinjiang is rich in mineral resources including coal, petroleum and natural gas.&#13;
Also, agricultural and animal production has been increasing. Xinjiang has become an&#13;
important production area of grain and cotton in China and has large livestock herds,&#13;
especially sheep. The gross output value of agriculture and industry (GOVAI) increased&#13;
at an annual rate of 19.7 percent during 1980-94 and reached about Y 89.7 billion in&#13;
1994. GOVAI per capita in 1994 for the Region (Y 5,540) was about the same as that for&#13;
China, whereas the corresponding figure for Urumqi (Y 6,432) was about 116 percent of&#13;
that for China.&#13;
2.3   The core of the current economy of Xinjiang, located on the north slope of the&#13;
Tianshan Mountains contains the main industrial developments in the Region such as&#13;
petroleum, petrochemicals, coal, electric power, iron and steel, building materials, textiles&#13;
and food industries. It accounts for 43 percent of the total number of industrial&#13;
enterprises, 70 percent of the industrial output and 21 percent of the agricultural output of&#13;
the Region. Moreover, it contains four (Urumqi, Shihezi, Kuitun and Bole) of the six&#13;
open cities in the Region. The development of this area is supported by the only railroad&#13;
in the Region and the two main arterial crossroads of Xingxingxia-Urumqi-Yining Road&#13;
and Altay-Urumqi-Hotan Road.&#13;
B. TRANSPORT NETWORK&#13;
2.4   Xinjiang is served by a sparse network of railways, highways, civil aviation and a&#13;
pipeline (Map IBRD 27622). The Region has presently only one main railway line&#13;
(1,803 km), which connects Xingxingxia with Alataw Shankou as an extension of the&#13;
Lanzhou-Xinjiang (Lan-Xin) railway line, and branches at Daheyan to reach Korla.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Double tracking of the Wuweinan (Gansu Province)-Urumqi section has been completed,&#13;
which would increase its transport capacity from the present 11 million tons per year to&#13;
35 million tons per year.&#13;
2.5   The airline network of Xinjiang consists of 12 airports, of which Urumqi is&#13;
classified as international. The network consists of 12 intraregional air routes and 24&#13;
interregional air routes, as well as four international flights to Almatay, Istanbul,&#13;
Tajikistan and Moscow. The total length of the network is about 53,715 km. The&#13;
number of passengers carried by air has increased at a rapid pace (31.5 percent per year)&#13;
from 89,000 in 1985 to 1,060,000 in 1994 (Table 2.1).&#13;
2.6   The pipeline system in Xinjiang is a local service conveying crude oil from the&#13;
Tarim and Jungar fields to railheads. Oil production has increased from 5.58 million tons&#13;
in 1980 to 16.5 million tons in 1994 (or a 8.1 percent increase per year). The total length&#13;
of the pipeline system in Xinjiang is 875 km, which presently transports 8.81 million tons&#13;
annually.&#13;
2.7   Xinjiang's highway system extends about 28,611 km, of which only 38 km  (0.1&#13;
percent of the total) are Class I roads, 4,132 km (14.4 percent of the total) are Class II&#13;
roads, 8,554 km (30.0 percent of the total) are Class III, 12,172 km (42.6 percent of the&#13;
total) are Class IV roads, and the remainder are tracks (Table 2.2). The Xinjiang&#13;
Highway Project I (XHP1), which includes the East-West (between Turpan and Urumqi)&#13;
and North-South (between Dahuangshan and Urumqi) corridors, has been successfully&#13;
implemented since March 1995 as the first Bank-financed highway project in Xinjiang.&#13;
The administrative classification of the road system in 1994 was as follows:&#13;
km              Percent&#13;
National               8,533              29.8&#13;
Provincial             6,797             23.8&#13;
County                10,223             35.7&#13;
Township                852                3.0&#13;
Other                  2,206               7.7&#13;
Total            28.611             100.0&#13;
2.8   Highways provide the only means of transport for large areas of the Region. The&#13;
density of the system is only 1.79 km per 100 km , which is equivalent to one seventh of&#13;
the national average. Most of the existing highway network were initially built to gravel&#13;
standard and then later overlayed with a bituminous surface treatment without adequate&#13;
pavement strengthening. These roads have now inadequate structural strength to cope&#13;
with the growing traffic. The regional government is giving high priority to repairing and&#13;
strengthening these roads and to expansion of the highway network, especially Class III&#13;
and IV roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9.-&#13;
C. TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS AND GROWTH&#13;
2.9   Over the 1985-94 period, traffic has been rising strongly in all modes, with&#13;
highway transport dominating both freight and passenger services. In 1994, highways&#13;
transported 98 percent of the passengers and 64 percent of the passenger-kilometers and&#13;
92 percent of the freight tons and 40 percent of the ton-kilometers in Xinjiang (Table&#13;
2.1). Railways carried a lesser portion of freight tonnage and the largest amount of ton-&#13;
kilometers of freight, reflecting the very long haul distances (900 km by rail vs. about&#13;
40 km by road). Air transport, albeit very small, is playing an increasingly important role&#13;
in Xinjiang because of the long distances between cities and the small size of the highway&#13;
network and its limited geographic distribution. Highway traffic, nevertheless, rose at&#13;
high rates, 10.4 percent per year for freight ton-miles and 20.0 percent per year for&#13;
passenger-kilometers (Table 2.1).&#13;
2.10  The highway traffic growth rates are reflected in the changes in traffic densities on&#13;
some of the 15,300 km of National and Provincial Roads in the Region (Table 2.3). In&#13;
1985, about eight percent of the National and Provincial Road network carried more than&#13;
2,000 motor vehicles per day (mvpd). By 1994, the sections carrying more than 2,000&#13;
mvpd had increased to 17 percent of the network, while the length of roads carrying over&#13;
5,000 mvpd had reached 420 km.&#13;
2.11  During 1986-94, the total length of Class III and IV roads was increased by about&#13;
3,800 km and 6,100 km, respectively. In 1985, highways transported 34 million&#13;
passengers, growing to 310 million passengers in 1994, which represents an annual&#13;
growth rate of about 27.8 percent.&#13;
2.12  Highway traffic includes slow-moving vehicles, mainly tractors of various sizes,&#13;
bicycles and other nonmotorized vehicles. In 1994, this slow-moving traffic accounted&#13;
for about eight percent (in the converted traffic volume) of all motorized traffic in major&#13;
urban areas. The sections of the existing UKH between Urumqi and Wugongtai and&#13;
within city limits of Manasi, Shihezi and Shawan along the existing Route 312 has the&#13;
worst traffic congestion.&#13;
D. THE VEHICLE FLEET&#13;
2.13  The total vehicle fleet has expanded rapidly (12.3 percent per year for motorized&#13;
vehicles) in the nine years between 1985 and 1994 (Table 2.4). During this period, the&#13;
fleets of medium- and small-size trucks, and small buses and passenger cars grew by 33&#13;
percent and 21 percent per year, respectively, reflecting the growth in prosperity and also&#13;
the light-vehicle needs of the growing number of smaller enterprises in the economy.&#13;
Also, motorcycles registered an impressive annual growth rate of 36 percent. Tractors,&#13;
which reached 194,000 units in 1994, are mainly used for agricultural purposes, but also&#13;
travel on the roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
E. HIGHWAY SAFETY&#13;
2.14  Highway safety is a serious problem in Xinjiang, as elsewhere in China. In 1994&#13;
alone, 1,712 persons were killed and 2,884 persons were injured in the 4,490 accidents&#13;
reported to the police in that year (Table 2.5). The severity of accidents (the number&#13;
killed in relation to the total number killed and injured) is also high. International&#13;
comparisons of the number killed in traffic accidents per 10,000 vehicles show that the&#13;
rate in Xinjiang is about 30 times higher than that for Western Europe and North&#13;
America.&#13;
2.15  Most responsibility for matters affecting highway safety lies with the Traffic&#13;
Police of the Public Security Bureau (PSB), including that for vehicle inspection, driver&#13;
training, propaganda on safety, imposition of fines, driver licensing, enforcement of&#13;
traffic laws, related traffic management, highway patrols and all aspects of accident&#13;
control, reporting, investigation and research.   The Xinjiang Communications&#13;
Department (XCD) retains responsibility for all matters concerning safe highway designs&#13;
and traffic control devices.&#13;
F. HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION&#13;
2.16  XCD controls all highway undertaking in the Region. XCD reports directly to the&#13;
regional government and acts as its administrative arm for planning, budgeting and&#13;
financing of highway transport in the Region.&#13;
2.17  The administration of the road network in the Region takes place at three levels:&#13;
(a) Xinjiang Highway Administration Bureau (XHAB), (b) general highway bureaus in&#13;
each district and prefecture, and (c) local-level highway units of the county highway&#13;
bureaus. XCD administers the regional highways through XHAB, and municipal and&#13;
county transport bureaus administer local highways and village roads. Apart from the&#13;
high-grade highways such as TUDH and UKH, XHAB is responsible for all highway&#13;
matters, including construction and maintenance, but receives professional and technical&#13;
guidance from the Engineering Administration Department of MOC. It has a staff of 161.&#13;
The 15 municipal and prefectural highway bureaus and the 83 county bureaus in the&#13;
region have a total staff of about 17,700, of which technical personnel are 870.&#13;
2.18 The Xinjiang High-Grade Highway Construction Authority (XHGHCA) (through&#13;
its Project Execution Office-PEO) is presently responsible for the construction of high-&#13;
grade highways and is also taking a role as the High-Grade Highway Administration&#13;
Bureau, which is in charge of the direction, coordination, planning, design, construction,&#13;
supervision, operation, and maintenance of high-grade highway projects in the Region.&#13;
The multiagency Authority is led by a Vice Governor of Xinjiang People's Government&#13;
(as Director-General) and by the Director of XCD (Deputy Director General). The PEO&#13;
is responsible for raising construction funds, including collection of tolls on these&#13;
highways, and paying back bank loans. It currently has a staff of about 80 and this&#13;
number will be increased as the scope of work is expanded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
G. PLANNING, BUDGETING AND FINANCING&#13;
2.19  Planning. XCD has overall responsibility for planning, construction, operation&#13;
and maintenance of the regional highway network. The prefectural and county authorities&#13;
have considerable autonomy in planning smaller road investments, but this is subject to&#13;
the approval of XCD. Each administrative group prepares investment plans for the&#13;
highway network under its jurisdiction and submits them to the planning division of XCD&#13;
by June of each year for the next year's plan. XCD approves the next year's plan for each&#13;
county or local authority concerned before the end of March. Similarly, using inputs&#13;
from lower-level administrative groups, XCD prepares the five-year road development&#13;
plan, reflecting national or regional development policy guidelines and objectives.&#13;
2.20  Budgeting. XCD's planning division adopts a balanced budget policy. The&#13;
proposed highway expenditures are balanced against the revenues earmarked for highway&#13;
development; the amount of investment approved for each year is closely related to the&#13;
revenues expected for the same year.&#13;
2.21   Financing. Highway funding sources and expenditures are summarized in Table&#13;
2.6. Data for 1994 are displayed in Figure 2.1. Funding for highway construction and&#13;
maintenance comes from several sources, but by far the largest source is the road&#13;
maintenance fee (RMF), which provided Y 860 million (about 81 percent) of all highway&#13;
ftunding (Y 1,063 million) for the Region in 1994. This fee is collected by XCD from&#13;
motor vehicles throughout the Region. XCD retains all revenues from RMF after the&#13;
following are paid:   Y  15 million to the Ministry of Finance's Energy and&#13;
Communication Fund; Y 10 million to the State Planning Commission (SPC)-controlled&#13;
Budget Adjustment Fund; and PSB for their highway patrol and administrative operations&#13;
(about 2.5 percent of the maintenance fee after deducting Y 25.0 million for energy and&#13;
communications fund and the budget adjustment fund). The RMF retained by XCD&#13;
increased from about Y 289 million in 1986 to Y 814 million in 1994. The RMF is&#13;
levied monthly on vehicles owned by transport companies as a percentage of their&#13;
financial turnover (presently 15 percent of gross revenue). Other vehicles are charged a&#13;
monthly fee (presently Y 170 per month per payload ton).&#13;

2.22  Other sources of revenues include grants from MOC, which provided Y 150&#13;
million (14 percent of total) in 1994, and locally collected capital and self-raised finds&#13;
with an aggregate amount of Y 52 million (5 percent). The Region also raises highway&#13;
funds by adding a passenger tariff surcharge, currently 1.0 fen per passenger-km. The&#13;
total amounts collected from this sources were Y 33.1 million in 1991 and Y 42.0 million&#13;
in 1994 and have been used for construction of transportation terminals. In addition to&#13;
road user charges discussed above, substantial fuel taxes are levied, but these accrue to&#13;
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and are not allocated back to highway funding. Fuel&#13;
taxes currently amount to 43 percent of the base price of gasoline and 13 percent of the&#13;
base price of diesel fuels.&#13;
H. ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
2.23  Engineering. Road and bridge projects are designed by the planning and design&#13;
institutes at the national, regional, prefectural and county levels. The Xinjiang Highway&#13;
Planning, Survey and Design Institute (XHPSDI) is qualified for Class I roads and is&#13;
responsible for all major road, bridge and tunnel projects. It carries out most of the work&#13;
itself but also uses the services of MOC's design institutes and private consulting firms&#13;
outside the region on a contract basis. Due to overload of design works, both preliminary&#13;
and detailed designs for UKH were entrusted to the MOC's First Highway Survey and&#13;
Design Institute in Xian (FHSDI). The design institutes at the municipal and county&#13;
levels are responsible for lower-grade county and township road design works.&#13;
2.24  Construction Supervision.  Xinjiang Highway Engineering Quality Control&#13;
Center (XHEQCC) is responsible for quality testing and overall supervision of all&#13;
transport projects in the Region. Construction of roads and bridges is supervised by&#13;
personnel from county, city and prefectural units. Generally, these units have relatively&#13;
competent personnel to supervise the works adequately. The Engineering Supervision&#13;
Office (ESO) of XHGHCA, approved by MOC, has been carrying out the supervision of&#13;
high-grade highways in Xinjiang.&#13;
2.25  Construction. XCD's Highway Engineering Division is normally responsible for&#13;
the construction of key highway projects in the Region. XHGHCA is responsible for the&#13;
management and construction of high-grade highways. The municipal and county&#13;
highway bureaus have their own construction units to carry out construction of minor&#13;
projects within their administrative districts. However, in recent years competitive&#13;
bidding has been introduced in the Region, following the SPC directive that all major&#13;
civil works be awarded after competitive bidding. Many of the larger regional and urban&#13;
construction bureaus, railway engineering and mining engineering units have been&#13;
reorganized into financially independent contracting companies. Thus, the construction&#13;
units under the communication departments of the various cities and provinces can also&#13;
participate in transprovincial bidding activities.&#13;
2.26  Maintenance. Highway maintenance is carried out by county highway bureaus&#13;
under the control of municipal authorities. Maintenance is generally labor-intensive, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
is neither well-organized nor well-carried out. Only about 57 percent (5,500 km) of the&#13;
paved network maintained by XHAB is rated as being in good condition. The average&#13;
International Roughness Index (IRI) calculated from the survey data on 9,700 km of&#13;
paved roads was found to be 6.7 mm/m of road. This very high average road surface&#13;
roughness indicates that many pavements are in a state of serious distress and that they&#13;
have suffered from low quality maintenance operations. The poor condition of the&#13;
highway network is due in part to the insufficient allocation of financial and budgetary&#13;
resources to maintenance.  To ensure that adequate maintenance is carried out,&#13;
assurances were obtained at negotiations from XAR that XCD would, by March 30 of&#13;
each year commencing in 1997 and ending in 2003, furnish an annual highway&#13;
maintenance report covering all national and provincial roads for the Bank's review and&#13;
comments, which would: (a) show the length of each class of road by condition (good,&#13;
fair, and bad); (b) establish targets for the following year, including an estimate of the&#13;
required physical works (routine maintenance, periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and&#13;
upgrading) and the cost thereof; and (c) measure the results and the actual expenditures&#13;
against the targets and the budgeted funds thereof&#13;
I. HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT&#13;
2.27  Xinjiang's investments in highways have increased from Y 2.4 billion during the&#13;
7FYP (1986-1990) to Y 5.1 billion during the 8FYP (1991-95) and to a projected 14.1&#13;
billion (1996-2000). Details of the proposed expenditure under the 9FYP are shown in&#13;
Table 2.6.&#13;
2.28  The short term (five years ) plans, which form the basis of the proposals for the&#13;
9FYP, include completion of the TUDH by September 1998 and the proposed UKH by&#13;
September 2000. Details of the proposals are shown in Tables 2.7. The medium-term&#13;
(15 years) plans include construction of the Xingxingxia-Urumqi-Yining and Altay-&#13;
Urumqi-Hotan main arterial roads, comprising 392 km of Expressways, 540 km of Class&#13;
I highway, and other improvements to a total of 3,800 km of roads.&#13;
2.29  Realization of the short-term plans would imply an increase in expenditures of&#13;
more than 200 percent compared with the previous five-year plan period. Although&#13;
revenue projections indicate that this is feasible, these projections are predicated on a&#13;
continued high rate of growth of the regional economy and a consequent continuing high&#13;
rate of growth of the vehicle fleet and demand for road transport. Should these revenue&#13;
projections turn out to be optimistic, it is probable that the planned new construction&#13;
program would be rephased over a longer period.&#13;
2.30  In addition, there is a risk that any shortfall in projected revenue would put at risk&#13;
the proposed increase in reconstruction and maintenance expenditure. Although this&#13;
expenditure is projected to increase in both proportional (from 15 percent of total high&#13;
expenditure under the 8FYP to 20 percent under the 9FYP) absolute terms, XCD is aware&#13;
of the need to increase maintenance expenditure even further (Table 2.6).&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT FORMULATION AND PREPARATION&#13;
3.1   The support of high development in Xinjiang is particularly important since&#13;
highways provide the only means of transport for large areas of the Region. One of its&#13;
key transport corridors is the heavily traveled east-west corridor along National Highway&#13;
No. 312 from Urunmqi to Turpan in the east and to Kuitun and the Kazakhstan border in&#13;
the west. This route is a key strategic link among the 12 national trunk routes in the&#13;
NTHS. Following the identification/preparation mission in April 1995, the preappraisal&#13;
mission was sent in October 1995. The project was appraised in April 1996.&#13;
3.2   The Xinjiang Highway Project (TUDH) has been successfully implemented since&#13;
March 1995 as the first Bank-financed highway project in Xinjiang. Although it is still&#13;
too early to evaluate the full implementation of the project, substantial experience has&#13;
been accumulated through the preparation and implementation of the project.&#13;
International supervision consultants have been extensively involved in the actual work&#13;
rather than simply acting as advisors to the construction agency. This set-up contributes&#13;
to an improvement in construction quality and compliance with the planned&#13;
implementation schedule. Consequently, this set-up would also be applied for the UKH.&#13;
The other important lessons learned from XHP1 concerns road maintenance. To ensure&#13;
that adequate funds would be allocated to the highway maintenance program, the Bank&#13;
was involved in the planning of the sources and uses of highway funds in Xinjiang for the&#13;
9FYP. Furthermore, for the first time in the highway sector in China, a portion of the&#13;
Bank's loan ($30 million) would be used to finance priority physical maintenance&#13;
activities. Road sections to be rehabilitated under this program were determined on the&#13;
basis of results of a highway maintenance study financed under XHP 1.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.3   The proposed project builds on the achievement of the ongoing Bank-assisted&#13;
XHP1. The project has the following objectives:&#13;
(a)   support development of road infrastructure to relieve congestion, and&#13;
stimulate socioeconomic development in the UKH corridor;&#13;
(b)   improve maintenance of the regional highway network;&#13;
(c)   promote development of institutional capacities of XCD, through training&#13;
and other means;&#13;
(d)   increase highway safety; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
(e)   promote transport linkages with neighboring provinces and countries.&#13;
3.4   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) for China, presented to the Board on June 1, 1995, and the Progress Report&#13;
discussed on March 26, 1996 support China's strategy to alleviate infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks by, inter alia, rapidly modernizing and expanding its highway system. The&#13;
proposed project would further this goal by rehabilitating and maintaining the existing&#13;
highway network through the proposed highway maintenance program and implementing&#13;
the Urumqi-Kuitun Highway segment of the NTHS. Furthermore, Bank assistance to&#13;
NTHS construction would facilitate interprovincial and international trade and promote&#13;
long-distance and transit road traffic, while furthering the liberalization, facilitation and&#13;
cost reduction of transport, key requirements for market-oriented reforms to succeed.&#13;
Bank support is also justified by providing a technical assistance to a strategic study of&#13;
transport linkages between Xinjiang and neighboring provinces and countries.&#13;
C. PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
3.5   Project impact would be monitored with respect to the project objectives (PO), the&#13;
key indicators of which are listed below.&#13;
Po (a):     (i) reduced congestion levels on roads parallel to the proposed new road&#13;
(ii) increased average travel speeds on roads parallel to the proposed new&#13;
road&#13;
PO (b):     (i) improved road surface roughness on the paved road network&#13;
(ii) increased segments of national and provincial roads in fair and good&#13;
condition&#13;
PO (c):     (i) reduced numbers of traffic accidents and fatalities on existing roads&#13;
In Annex 9, the following are delineated:&#13;
(a)   More specific description of monitoring indicators;&#13;
(b)   Baseline values;&#13;
(c)   Mid-term benchmarks&#13;
(d)   Interim benchmarks; and&#13;
(e)   Target benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
3.6   The achievement of project output would be tracked by monitoring indicators,&#13;
listed below. Project output can be defined as immediate project targets and initial flows&#13;
of services, such as physical quantity (length of road constructed); institutional&#13;
strengthening (training achieved), and quality (road surface roughness, safety initiatives).&#13;
The following monitoring indicators were set up for some of the key project components.&#13;
There are time-bound monitorable targets that would be described either as actual&#13;
physical outputs or as a percentage of components implemented.&#13;
Monitoring Indicators:&#13;
(a)   UKH civil works completed&#13;
(b)   roads under the highway maintenance and rehabilitation program&#13;
completed;&#13;
(c)   progress made in the implementation of the training component for XCD&#13;
and its affiliated institutions;&#13;
(d)   black spots improvement completed; and&#13;
(e)   signing and marking on highways completed.&#13;
The proposed monitorable targets are shown in Annex 9.&#13;
D. PROJECT SCOPE&#13;
3.7   The scope of the project includes:&#13;
(a)   Construction of a 267.4 km highway (UKH) on new right-of-way (ROW)&#13;
between Urumqi and Kuitun (Map, IBRD 27623) which consists of:&#13;
(i)   a 218.3 km 4-lane expressway between Urumqi and Kuitun;&#13;
(ii)    a 32.4 km bypass to the west of Urumqi, including an 18.5 km 2-&#13;
lane Class 2 motor vehicle only highway and a 13.9 km 4-lane&#13;
Class 1 highway; and&#13;
(iii)    a 16.7 km 4-lane Class I highway which links UKH with the&#13;
Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan Highway (TUDH).&#13;
(b)   UKH would be operated as a toll facility. This would entail:&#13;
(i)   supply and installation of electrical, electronic and mechanical&#13;
equipment for toll collection, telecommunication and lighting of&#13;
bridges, interchanges and toll collection area; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
(ii)   construction along UKH  of management and maintenance&#13;
buildings, parking and service areas.&#13;
(c)   Construction, rehabilitation and upgrading sections of 4 linking roads with&#13;
a total length of about 18.8 km.&#13;
(d)   Construction supervision of UKH and its linking roads.&#13;
(e)   Highway maintenance program to maintain and rehabilitate about 2,450&#13;
km of the existing highway network during the 9FYP.&#13;
(f)   Provision of equipment for:&#13;
(i)   control of construction quality during the construction of UKH and&#13;
linking roads;&#13;
(ii)   operation and maintenance of UKH;&#13;
(iii)    maintenance of the regional highway network;&#13;
(iv)   institutional strengthening of XCD and related institutions; and&#13;
(v)   highway safety component.&#13;
(g)   Institutional development consisting of strengthening relevant institutions&#13;
and training schools affiliated with XCD.&#13;
(h)   A highway safety program consisting of improvement of black spots, road&#13;
signing and marking works, and training programs.&#13;
(i)   A strategic study of regional transport.&#13;
Construction of UKH&#13;
3.8   The total length of the existing road (National Highway No. 312) from Urumqi to&#13;
Kuitun is 262 km. The highway standard is Class II (except for about 30 km of Class I&#13;
road immediately west of Urumqi) with no separation of the motorized and slow-moving&#13;
traffic. The projected traffic cannot be accommodated by the existing road beyond 1998&#13;
at an acceptable level of service. Widening of the existing road would not be feasible&#13;
because of the extensive side development along several townships and the poor&#13;
construction of the existing pavement and drainage structures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
3.9   Slow-moving vehicles such as tractors and bicycles will not be allowed access to&#13;
UKH. Access to and from UKH would be provided at 16 interchanges. UKH also&#13;
includes about 32 grade separations, 8 long bridges, 5 medium-size bridges, 51 small&#13;
bridges, 166 underpasses to provide access to adjacent property, and about 561 culverts.&#13;
The pavement structure is asphalt concrete with a total thickness ranging between 53 and&#13;
67 cm.&#13;
3.10  UKH would be operated as an open toll highway. Three toll plazas on the main&#13;
roadway and five tolling stations on the interchange ramps are planned. In addition to&#13;
civil works, UKH includes:  (a) the electrical, electronic and mechanical (E&amp;M)&#13;
installations required for toll collection, telecommunications, power supply, and lighting;&#13;
(b) construction of four service areas and four parking areas; and (c) four management&#13;
and maintenance buildings to be located at Urumqi, Changji, Shihezi and Kuitun.&#13;
3.11  The preliminary engineering designs of UKH were prepared by FHSDI and&#13;
reviewed by Italian experts under the Italian Trust Funds.  MOC approved the&#13;
preliminary engineering designs in May 1995. The detailed engineering designs and bid&#13;
documents were completed in October 1995 and were reviewed by the same Italian&#13;
experts in October 1995. SPC approved the final engineering designs in December 1995.&#13;
3.12  Linking Roads. On the basis of a comprehensive review of all the linking roads&#13;
along UKH, XCD selected four provincial roads, with a total length of 18.8 kin, for new&#13;
construction, upgrading and reconstruction. Due to the short length of these roads, no&#13;
separate bid documents were prepared for them; instead they are included within the&#13;
corresponding documents for UKH.&#13;
Supervision of Construction of UKH and Linking Roads&#13;
3.13  Based on the experience gained from completed and ongoing Bank-financed&#13;
highway projects in China including XHPI, a combined team of local engineers,&#13;
technicians and other personnel and international consultants would be set up to supervise&#13;
the construction of the UKH and linking roads. The organizational arrangements and&#13;
Terms of Reference for supervision of the UKH have been drawn up by PEO and were&#13;
found to be adequate. The international supervising engineers would be integrated into&#13;
the organization with operational responsibilities.  Furthermore, the international&#13;
consultants would help establish procedures at all levels of the supervisory work,&#13;
including on-site inspections and laboratory testing, and train local staff both through&#13;
formnal training sessions and on-the-job.&#13;
3.14  A team composed of about 312 local staff and 7 international experts was agreed&#13;
for the supervision of UKH and linking roads. They would be retained until completion&#13;
of the construction of UKH. The international firm supplying the experts would also&#13;
provide three trainers to train 150 staff locally for one month and 30 staff abroad for one&#13;
month. The total effort by the international staff is estimated at about 216 person-&#13;
months, composed of 183 person-months for supervision of civil works, 11 person-&#13;
months for supervision of the electrical and mechanical facilities component, 3 person-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
months for training both locally and abroad, and 19 person-months as contingency to be&#13;
used for unforeseen specialist services to be used if and when needed.&#13;
Highway Maintenance&#13;
3.15  In order to tackle highway maintenance problems, XCD carried out a highway&#13;
network maintenance study financed under XHP1. The study proposes a four-year&#13;
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program, which would be aimed at stabilizing the&#13;
conditions of the existing network at a maintainable level by strengthening the seriously&#13;
deteriorated pavement structures and by overlaying rehabilitation of most needed&#13;
sections. The four-year program was prepared based on an annual budget ceiling of about&#13;
Y 185 million ($22 million), included as item II 4 (b) Periodic Maintenance in Table 2.6,&#13;
"Xinjiang Highway Revenues and Expenditures." The project provides financing for a&#13;
four-year Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program (MRP) which covers about 78 percent&#13;
of the total budgeted program ($17 million of $22 million). A list of contract packages,&#13;
showing road sections and strategy of improvement, for the first year (1997) is included&#13;
in Annex 1. In addition to the MRP, the project also includes procurement of equipment&#13;
for maintenance of the highway network, training of staff, and strengthening of&#13;
institutions such as XCS and XCTWS that supply skilled labor for maintenance&#13;
operations.&#13;
3.16  Selection of Road Sections. The proposed MRP would include rehabilitation of&#13;
about 2,450 km of existing paved national and provincial roads, of which about 956 km&#13;
(39 percent) would need strengthening of the pavement structure and 1,496 km would be&#13;
overlaid by 40 mm or 60 mm asphalt concrete. The criteria for screening and selection of&#13;
road sections to be included in the MRP are detailed in Annex 1. The cost of the four-&#13;
year MRP is estimated at about Y 577 million ($70 million). The EIRR for the first year&#13;
(1997) of the MRP is estimated at 92 percent.&#13;
3.17  The individual road sections for the first year (1997) were selected on the basis of&#13;
priorities given in the proposed study program and the need for a reasonable uniform&#13;
standard of sections, taking into account the location of road sections, size of contracts,&#13;
and the administrative aspects of design and contract management. The additional road&#13;
sections to be improved under this MRP will be drawn from the pool of prioritized road&#13;
segments identified in the study mentioned above (para 3.16), and their submission for&#13;
approval to the Bank will be effected in manageable batches of projects.  The&#13;
documentation to be developed as part of the Bank approval process will constitute a&#13;
Project File including: (a) an economic analysis including evidence that each of the&#13;
proposed sections meets the EIRR criteria; and (b) a technical analysis, including&#13;
proposed designs and cost estimates.&#13;
3.18  Implementation. XHAB would undertake detailed engineering investigation and&#13;
designs of all highway sections to be included in the MRP. The road sections to be&#13;
improved will be packaged into 6-12 contracts for each year's work. These maintenance&#13;
and rehabilitation works will be procured through National Competitive Bidding (NCB),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
and undertaken by contractors. Bidding documents will be prepared by competent&#13;
technical personnel at county level, and coordinated and guided by a special design group&#13;
within XHAB. A separate supervision group would also be set up within XHAB to have&#13;
overall responsibility for supervision of construction of MRP contracts. These groups&#13;
within XHAB will be assisted by subgroups at county level to carry out detailed&#13;
investigations and supervision of road construction within their area. The subgroups will&#13;
be composed of local personnel from the relevant county highway bureaus under XHAB&#13;
and are capable of supervising the works.&#13;
3.19 Monitoring of MRP. The average road surface roughness (IRI) on the paved&#13;
road network would serve as an indicator of achievement of the objective for improved&#13;
serviceability. IRI is expected to be improved from the present 6.4 mm/m to about 5.6&#13;
mmnm after the four-year program. Assurances were obtained at negotiations from XAR&#13;
that it would, by January 31 of each year commencing in 1997 and ending in 2000,&#13;
furnish an annual highway maintenance and rehabilitation program report on roads&#13;
under MRP for the Bank's review and comments, which would.  (a) show the&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation activities undertaken during the previous year including&#13;
costs; (b) show the results of IRI on the paved highway network; and (c) establish targets&#13;
for the following year, including an estimate of the proposed works, costs and expected&#13;
'RI:&#13;
Equipment&#13;
3.20  The equipment to be provided under the project was based on those procured&#13;
under XHP 1 and reviewed by the Bank. The final agreed lists of equipment together with&#13;
their estimated costs are available in the project files. These lists include equipment&#13;
required for operation and maintenance of UKH, control of construction quality during&#13;
construction of UKH and linking roads, maintenance of highway network, institutional&#13;
strengthening of XCD and related institutions and training schools and the highway&#13;
safety program. The preliminary total equipment cost is estimated at about Y 91.8&#13;
million ($11.3 million), of which $9.5 million would be in foreign currencies. The Bank&#13;
and XCD agreed that the equipment lists should be looked at as subject to reasonable&#13;
change with regard to type and number, and consequently, some flexibility should be&#13;
exercised during project implementation to properly allow for changing circumstances&#13;
and needs.&#13;
3.21  Equipment for UKH. To support of the construction supervision activities of&#13;
UKH and its linking roads, there is a need for equipment and instruments. For the&#13;
operation and maintenance of UKH, equipment requirements have also been identified.&#13;
This equipment is in addition to the site laboratory equipment and surveying instruments&#13;
to be provided by the contractors for the civil works, and the toll collection and&#13;
telecommunication equipment to be provided by the contractor for the&#13;
electrical/mechanical works for UKH.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
3.22  Equipment for Maintenance of Roads. This equipment consists of urgently&#13;
required equipment for routine, periodic and maintenance and heavy repair of roads to&#13;
replenish the equipment fleet of the regional and county maintenance units.&#13;
3.23  Equipment for Institutional Strengthening.  These consist of specialized&#13;
equipment for support of the four relevant institutions of XCD that would be strengthened&#13;
under the proposed project (paras. 3.24-3.26).&#13;
Institutional Strengthening and Training&#13;
3.24  The institutional strengthening measures under this component are part of a broad,&#13;
long-term effort started as part of XHP1. The purpose of this component is to build up&#13;
the planning, construction, maintenance and overall management capabilities of XCD, in&#13;
the light of its rapidly expanding investment and maintenance program. The priority&#13;
areas to be addressed here include highway engineering, highway maintenance and the&#13;
operations and management of high-grade highways. The component also strengthens&#13;
XCD's institutional capabilities to train qualified technical and supervisory personnel for&#13;
the maintenance of the Xinjiang highway network. The total cost of the Institutional&#13;
Strengthening and Training (IST) component is estimated at Y 15.0 million, of which&#13;
$1.12 million is in foreign currencies (Annex2).&#13;
3.25  IST component consists of three elements:&#13;
(a)   Organizational Strengthening. Through staff development (49 person-&#13;
months in Training and Investigation Study Tours outside China) and&#13;
related equipment for the priority organizations in the sector, i.e. the High-&#13;
Grade Highway Administration Bureau (XHAB), the Xinjiang&#13;
Communications School (XCS), the Xinjiang Communications Technical&#13;
Workers School (XCTWS), and the Highway Administration Bureau's&#13;
Shihezi Training Center (STC) (Annex 2). The estimated total cost of this&#13;
element is Y 10.9 million (of which $0.93 million is in foreign currencies).&#13;
(b)   Staff Training. This element covers skills upgrading and specialized&#13;
training for 710 persons (897 person-months) in Xinjiang, in other parts of&#13;
China and abroad, for the staff in the organizations cited under&#13;
Organizational Strengthening, as well as for the staff of units which did&#13;
not receive support under XHPI: the Highway Engineering Quality&#13;
Control Center (XHEQCC), the Highway Engineering Quota Management&#13;
Center (HEQMC), and the Telecommunications Information Center (TIC).&#13;
The cost of this element is Y 2.6 million (of which $0.05 million is in&#13;
foreign currencies).&#13;
(c)   Technical Assistance. This element includes support for the training of&#13;
trainers at three technical training institutions, for an estimated total cost&#13;
of Y 1.5 million (of which $0.15 is in foreign currencies).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
3.26  Each of the agencies supported by this component prepared proposals for staff and&#13;
organizational strengthening in the forrn of Training Needs Outlines. These were&#13;
reviewed in detail by Bank staff for interagency consistency and sectoral coherence, and&#13;
found to be satisfactory. The PEO staff responsible for managing the IST component&#13;
under XHP1 also prepared an exhaustive Report on Institutional Strengthening and&#13;
Training which includes an inventory of personnel in the sector organizations and a&#13;
detailed list of equipment required under the component justified on the basis of sector&#13;
functions and activities to be improved. The Report on IST is part of the Project File.&#13;
Highway Safety Program&#13;
3.27  In 1994 alone, 4,490 traffic accidents occurred on Xinjiang's highways, resulting&#13;
in 1,712 fatalities and 2,884 injuries. The severity of accidents (in terms of the number&#13;
killed in traffic accidents per 10,000 vehicles) indicates that the rate in Xinjiang is much&#13;
higher than that of whole China. Annex 3 summarizes the existing highway safety&#13;
situation in Xinjiang and related problems and presents an implementable highway safety&#13;
program, which was discussed and agreed with XCD.&#13;
3.28  The design of UKH and the related linking roads was reviewed from a safety view&#13;
point by the Italian consultants and a Norwegian safety expert. Consequently, those&#13;
designs have been prepared to a high standard and reflect safety considerations&#13;
adequately. The highway safety program included under the project would build on what&#13;
was provided for highway safety in XHPI and comprises:&#13;
(a)   Establishing a Leading Group for Highway Safety Coordination to&#13;
coordinate between XCD and PSB, as well as a Highway Safety&#13;
Secretariat (HSS) to prepare the work for the Leading Group. The&#13;
Leading Group and HSS would be established by the end of 1996 and by&#13;
March 1997, respectively.&#13;
(b)   Developing procedures for safety audits by HSS.&#13;
(c)   Undertaking accident black spot analyses as well as the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation by the Traffic Science Institute, and implementation of&#13;
engineering works of the identified black spots by XCD. XCD agreed to&#13;
allocate Y 20 million ($2.4 million) to this purpose during 1997 and 1998.&#13;
(d)   Undertaking of road signing and marking works on some 60 km of Class&#13;
II highways to which about Y 8.7 million ($1.1 million) would be&#13;
allocated.&#13;
(e)   First aid will be introduced in the curricula for police and driver training as&#13;
well as child psychology for police officers responsible for training of&#13;
school children in traffic safety.&#13;
(f)   Other training activities such as study tours (Annex 3 for details).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
(g)   Provision of equipment to support the above activities (Ann.l3).&#13;
(h)   Evaluation of the implementation of the Highway Safety program by an&#13;
independent local expert (1.5 person-month).&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that XAR would establish and maintain: (a) a&#13;
Leading Group for traffic safety coordination, policy-making and planning, with&#13;
functions and responsibilities acceptable to the Bank; and (b) a Highway Safety&#13;
Secretariat to prepare work for the Leading Group, with functions and responsibilities&#13;
acceptable to the Bank to carry out a black spot identification and improvement program&#13;
and establish safety audit procedures and checks under terms of reference satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank Also, assurances were obtained during negotiations that XAR would, pursuant&#13;
to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank: (i) by October 31, 2000, complete a black&#13;
spot identification and improvement program; (ii) by October 31, 2000, complete a&#13;
program to improve road signs and markings; and (iii) by December 31, 2001, have an&#13;
expert acceptable to the Bank prepare an evaluation of its Highway Safety Program&#13;
according to indicators acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Regional Transport Study&#13;
3.29 The proposed study of transport within Xinjiang and between Xinjiang and&#13;
neighboring provinces and countries, would assist the government of the autonomous&#13;
region in identifying the principal medium-term transport needs and in developing plans&#13;
and policies to satisfy those needs so far as is economically justifiable and financially&#13;
feasible. The study would include a review of existing transport plans, infrastructure and&#13;
services and determine the extent to which these need to be modified in light of the&#13;
projected high rate of growth of demand for transport both within Xinjiang and in&#13;
connecting Xinjiang with the rest of China and its neighboring countries.&#13;
3.30  The principal outputs of the study would be recommendations for changes to&#13;
transport policy within the Region, and indications for a medium- and long-term transport&#13;
investment program. This program would be based on realistic expectations of the&#13;
investment funding likely to be available, taking into account national policies for&#13;
developing new financing sources for transport infrastructure. The study would be part of&#13;
the provincial-based studies of transport sector issues, to be supported by Bank highway&#13;
projects, as agreed between MOC and the Bank.&#13;
3.31  The study, which would be conducted by SPC's Comprehensive Transport&#13;
Research Institute with assistance from Xinjiang institutions, is expected to last 12&#13;
months. Draft outline terms of reference for the study are shown in Annex 4. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations from XAR that it would: (a) undertake and, by June 30,&#13;
1998, complete the study in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank;&#13;
(b) establish a review panel comprising representatives of the central government and&#13;
Xinjiang Region to guide the said study and provide comments on the results and&#13;
recommendations thereof; (c) by September 30, 1998, furnish the said study to the said&#13;
review panel for review; and (d) take appropriate steps to implement the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
recommendations of the study, taking into account the comments thereon of the said&#13;
review panel.&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.32  Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of UKH and its linking roads were&#13;
carried out by the Research Academy of Environmental Science (RAES). An EIA report,&#13;
an Environmental Action Plan (EAP), and an Environmental Assessment (EA) Summary&#13;
were revised several times based on the comments made by the Bank staff. The final&#13;
EIA, EAP and EA Summary of UKH were received by the Bank in December 1995 and&#13;
found to be satisfactory. Since the proposed MRP does not require any widening of&#13;
existing roads, its impact on the environment is minimal. However, the bidding&#13;
documents for the roads included in this component would include environmental clauses&#13;
that reflect good practices during construction, such as location of crushers and asphalt&#13;
plants, dust control, restriction of working hours, etc.&#13;
3.33  Major environmental impacts include dust and noise, soil erosion and impacts on&#13;
irrigation channels, and transportation of construction materials during the construction&#13;
period. Traffic noise and vehicle exhaust, soil erosion, and water pollution from service&#13;
areas were identified as major adverse impacts during the operation period. Some&#13;
problems deserving special attention include impacts on livestock migration, noise and&#13;
air pollution problems of Xishan linking road, and impact of traversing coal mines near&#13;
Xishan.&#13;
3.34  The EAPs specified the appropriate mitigation measures, environmental&#13;
monitoring plans, institutional arrangements to implement the EAPs, training and&#13;
equipment requirements, and budget needed for environmental protection.  Major&#13;
mitigation measures include appropriate design of overpasses/underpasses to minimize&#13;
social disruption, reconstruction of irrigation systems where appropriate, and water&#13;
sprinkling to reduce dust during the construction phase. Major mitigation measures&#13;
include resettlement and construction of noise barriers around the schools, hospitals and&#13;
residences, strengthening of vehicle emission inspections and better maintenance of&#13;
vehicles to minimize air pollution problems, and afforestation to improve landscape and&#13;
reduce air pollution during the operation phase. It was ascertained that the proposed&#13;
UKH and its linking roads will not affect ecologically sensitive areas and that their&#13;
construction and operation would have no adverse impact on the environment through the&#13;
implementation of the EAP. The summary of the EIAs and EAPs are presented in Anne&#13;
5 and copies of the EIAs and EAPs are available in the Public Information Center.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations from XAR that:  (a) the environmental&#13;
protection measures stipulated in the EAPs would be carried out in a manner satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank; and (b) XAR wouldfurnish to the Bank an annual environmental monitoring&#13;
report for UKH during the construction phase and for each of the first three years&#13;
following completion of construction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

F. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
3.35 Legal Framework and Resettlement Policies. The Land Administration Law of&#13;
China and Xinjiang Regional Land Administration Regulations are the legal basis for the&#13;
planning and implementation of land acquisition and resettlement for all highway&#13;
projects. Land acquisition and resettlement are well regulated in China, which generally&#13;
conform to the Bank's policies on involuntary resettlement. The main objective of the&#13;
resettlement program is to ensure that the affected people are able to at least restore, if not&#13;
improve their standards of living after resettlement. Also efforts have been made to&#13;
minimize acquisition of productive farmland and enterprises in order to reduce adverse&#13;
impacts of land acquisition and resettlement.&#13;
3.36  Project Impacts.  Construction of UKH and its linking roads will require&#13;
permanent acquisition of about 1,139.26 hectares (ha) of land and will affect about 3,706&#13;
persons. Another 466.54 ha of land would be required to be leased temporarily during&#13;
construction. About 265 households (1,106 persons) will be affected through house&#13;
relocation. The project will also affect nine enterprises employing 243 workers. A&#13;
detailed socioeconomic survey of the affected persons was completed by the Xinjiang&#13;
Academy of Social Sciences (XASS) in August 1996. The population of Xinjiang is 16.3&#13;
million, making up 1.3 percent of the population of China. They are composed of 49&#13;
ethnic groups. Among them, the most populous five ethnic groups are: Uygur, 7.19 m;&#13;
Han, 5.7 m; Kazakh 1.1 m; Hue 670,000; and Kyrgys, 140,000. In the project affected&#13;
area, the total city and county population is 2.8 million, and the majority (80 percent) are&#13;
Han. Affected persons live in ethnically integrated, multicultural communities and&#13;
conduct regular economic activities in agriculture, industry, and services. Those affected&#13;
through the loss of a house will be moved very short distances (100-300 meters) and will&#13;
remain close to their regular social, cultural, and economic practices. Their standards of&#13;
living will not be adversely affected after rehabilitation. The construction of the highway&#13;
will bring benefits to the dffected persons and their communities.&#13;
3.37  Implementation. It is expected that the land acquisition and resettlement (LAR)&#13;
activities will be completed by February 1997, whereas construction of UKH is expected&#13;
to start in March 1997. A Lead Group on resettlement has already been formed for XHP 1&#13;
(TUDH) project and the same group will be responsible for overseeing the&#13;
implementation of the RAPs for the UKH. A summary of the RAP is given in Annex 6.&#13;
A copy of the RAP is deposited in the Public Information Center. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations from XAR that all LAR activities with respect to the UKH and&#13;
linking roads would be completed according to the RAPs in a manner satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank&#13;
3.38  Monitoring and Evaluation.  The implementation of the RAPs will be&#13;
monitored both internally (by the Resettlement and Monitoring Office (RMO) and the&#13;
local communications bureau) and externally (by XASS, specially engaged by XCD for&#13;
the purpose).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(a)   Internal Monitoring. Internal monitoring, to be carried out by the staff&#13;
from the Resettlement and Monitoring Office (RMO) and those from the&#13;
local (city/county, and township) communications bureau, will be&#13;
undertaken every three months and a summary of internal reporting will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank every six months.  Internal monitoring will&#13;
concentrate on the physical progress of RAPs implementation.&#13;
(b)   External Monitoring.  The task of external monitoring of RAPs'&#13;
implementation by an independent agency has been entrusted to XASS.&#13;
Apart from physical monitoring of the LAR program, which will also be&#13;
carried out by the internal monitoring agencies, XASS will concentrate on&#13;
evaluation of the implementation of the RAPs. External monitoring will&#13;
start along with the initiation of LAR activities and will continue one year&#13;
beyond project completion (until 2001).  Monitoring reports will be&#13;
prepared every six months and submitted to PEO and the Bank. The first&#13;
external monitoring report will be submitted to the Bank by December 31,&#13;
1996. A final monitoring and evaluation report will also be prepared after&#13;
project completion (based on a "follow-up" socioeconomic survey of the&#13;
affected persons) and submitted to the Bank by December 31, 2001.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations from XAR that XCD would, for UKH, furnish&#13;
to the Bank: (a) by March 31 and September 30 of each year starting September 30,&#13;
1996 internal monitoring reports prepared by appropriate agencies of Xinjiang; and&#13;
(b) by June 30 and December 31 of each year starting December 31, 1996 external&#13;
monitoring reports prepared by an independent agency acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
regarding the implementation and input of the resettlement activities during the previous&#13;
six months, and carry out the monitoring of the effectiveness and socioeconomic impact&#13;
of the resettlement process for UKH and its linking roads according to the monitoring&#13;
plan in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. Implementation of the RAPs will also be&#13;
monitored through routine project supervision and project progress reports.&#13;
G. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.39  The project is estimated to cost about Y 5.40 billion or about $658 million,&#13;
including land acquisition and physical and price contingencies as summarized in the&#13;
following table and detailed in Table 3.1. The foreign exchange cost would be about&#13;
$280 million, or about 42 percent of the total. Base costs have been estimated using&#13;
December 1995 prices, and physical contingencies have been based on 10 percent of the&#13;
base costs of works and construction supervision of the highway component. Price&#13;
contingencies for foreign expenditures have been estimated on assumed international&#13;
price escalation of 3.3 percent in 1996, 2.3 percent in 1997, 2.5 percent in 1998 through&#13;
2001. Price contingencies for local costs have been estimated assuming annual price&#13;
escalation of 10.5 percent in 1996, 8.5 percent in 1997, 7.0 percent in 1998, 6.5 percent in&#13;
1999, and 6.2 percent in each of 2000 and 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
3.40   The costs of civil works are based on work quantities calculated from  detailed&#13;
engineering designs. The costs were computed on the basis of MOC's standard manuals&#13;
for labor and equipment productivity, the related annually updated costs and the current&#13;
market costs of materials.&#13;
3.41   The estimated cost of equipment is based on prevailing prices and those quoted by&#13;
manufacturers and suppliers and includes the cost of equipment delivered in Urumqi,&#13;
spare parts, and related training if needed to operate and maintain the equipment. The&#13;
estimated cost of consulting services are based on recent contracts for similar services&#13;
under ongoing highway projects.&#13;

H. FINANCING&#13;
3.42   The Bank loan of $300 million would finance about 46 percent of the total project&#13;
cost or 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 5 percent of the local cost. The&#13;
Central Government (MOC) would provide the equivalent of about $96.3 million, while&#13;
XAR would provide the equivalent of about $261.8 million to meet the remaining costs&#13;
of the project, including contingencies. MOC's funding would be restricted to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
construction of UKH. The Bank loan of $300 million would be at the standard interest&#13;
rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single-currency loans. It would be lent to the Ministry of&#13;
Finance for a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The proceeds of the Bank&#13;
loan would be made available to Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XAR) at the same&#13;
rate payable to the Bank by the Borrower with 0.75 percent per year commitment fee on&#13;
the outstanding balance, beginning 60 days after loan signing, less any waiver.&#13;
Agreement was obtained from the Borrower at negotiations that it would make the&#13;
proceeds of the loan available to XAR on these terms. XAR would bear the foreign&#13;
exchange risks. The Government of China and XAR have selected LIBOR-based US&#13;
dollar single-currency loan terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the&#13;
foreign exchange risk of their borrowings by more closely matching the currency of their&#13;
liabilities with that of their net trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar&#13;
denominated. They selected the LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full&#13;
maturity of the loan, compared to the fixed-rate option that would have resulted in a 15-&#13;
year loan. The Borrower judges that it can manage any interest rate risk.&#13;

I. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.43  Implementing Agencies.  The implementation of the ploject would be the&#13;
responsibility of XCD. The PEO would be the executing agency for the construction of&#13;
the UKH and related linking roads and their supervision as well as its related equipment&#13;
and all other equipment under the project except those destined to XHAB. XHAB would&#13;
be the executing agency for the highway maintenance and highway safety components, as&#13;
well as for the equipment for maintenance of the highway network (other than UKH).&#13;
PEO and XCD Education and Science and Technology Divisions would be responsible&#13;
for training. Training programs would be coordinated with those in other ongoing Bank-&#13;
financed highway projects by MOC. The executing agency for the study of transport&#13;
linkages with neighboring provinces and countries would be the Comprehensive&#13;
Transport Research Institute of SPC. The Traffic Police of PSB would be responsible for&#13;
the safety component, except the civil works component. CMC International Tendering&#13;
Company (CMC) has been retained by XCD as the procurement agency for all aspects of&#13;
civil works of the project requiring international competitive bidding (ICB) and for&#13;
equipment to be procured from abroad. The supervision of construction of UKH would&#13;
be carried out by a joint foreign/local supervision team. Upon completion, it is expected&#13;
that UKH would be operated and maintained by XHGHAB. Since UKH is a segment of&#13;
the national highway system, MOC would also provide general supervision and guidance&#13;
for execution of the project.&#13;
3.44 UKH and Linking Roads. The implementation program for UKH is shown in&#13;
Annex 7. All civil works would be tendered at the same time. The contracts for&#13;
electrical and mechanical facilities would be tendered about the middle period of the civil&#13;
works for UKH. The invitation for prequalification of contractors for civil works for&#13;
UKH was issued in December 1995 and the whole prequalification process was finished&#13;
by August 1996.&#13;
3.45  The detailed designs and bidding documents for all the 14 contract sections&#13;
(highway civil works) were completed by the end of December 1995. Acquisition of land&#13;
and the resettlement process are expected to be completed by February 1997. The&#13;
installation of electrical, electronic and mechanical systems for the operation of UKH is&#13;
scheduled to commence around the third quarter of 1998 and be completed by July of&#13;
2000. The construction of service facilities along UKH would be a continuous process&#13;
during the implementation period. The UKH is expected to be completed by September&#13;
2000.&#13;
3.46 Supervision of Construction of UKH and Linking Roads. A team of local&#13;
personnel, engineers and technicians recruited from other provincial institutions, and&#13;
international consultants would be established to supervise the construction of the UKH&#13;
and the linking roads. The joint supervision team (JST) would be headed by a Chief&#13;
Supervision Engineer. A Resident Engineer would be stationed on site for each of the 14&#13;
civil works contracts. Invitations to international short-listed consulting firms (approved&#13;
by the Bank) for supervision of construction were issued in May 1996. A firm would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
selected by October 1996. The consultants would be mobilized in February 1997 to&#13;
begin training of local personnel in construction supervision and to help set up the&#13;
supervision organization.&#13;
3.47  Institutional Strengthening and Training.  In view of the central role of&#13;
training for the strengthening of institutional capacity, XCD will implement this&#13;
component under an arrangement found to be satisfactory under XHPl: an Institutional&#13;
Strengthening Unit, located in the PEO, will act as the secretariat for an intra-XCD&#13;
Leading Group chaired by XCD Deputy Director, and responsible for providing advice&#13;
and oversight of the IST Office's activities in implementing this component. The IST&#13;
Unit will be charged with undertaking the planning, implementation, financial&#13;
management and coordination for the training and other elements in the component. The&#13;
unit will be headed by a Training Coordinator, reporting to the PEO Director and assisted&#13;
by two staff members from the Science and Technology and Education Departments of&#13;
XCD. The Training Coordinator will relate to all organizations in the sector with which&#13;
the component is concerned and would share financial control over the resources&#13;
allocated under the component.&#13;
3.48  Formal selection procedures for candidates to be trained have been developed and&#13;
agreed with the Bank. The criteria specified for the selection of staff for further training&#13;
will be the same as those applied under XHPI. These criteria include both educational&#13;
and experience requirements, as well as English language comprehension and ability:&#13;
trainees to be sent abroad for longer-term training would have a good working knowledge&#13;
of English or else would take a two-month long English course prior to traveling. Each&#13;
trainee would be required to submit a report on the training received to his/her parent&#13;
Department or agency.&#13;
3.49 The IST unit will submit to the Bank, on an annual basis, a Training Plan for the&#13;
next two-year period as well as a sample of the Training Needs Outlines and terms of&#13;
reference for the abroad training and study tours scheduled to occur as part of this Plan.&#13;
Progress Reports will be submitted to MOC for transmission to the World Bank, on an&#13;
annual basis, either at the same time as the Training Plan. By 1998, XCD will review the&#13;
results from a High Grade Highway Management Study carried out in Henan. XCD will&#13;
adapt this report to local conditions and determine what training, if any, needs to be&#13;
carried out, or if additional study is required. Any training or study resulting from this&#13;
will be carried out according to the same procedures as the IST component. At&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom XAR that XAR shall, by October 31 of each&#13;
year commencing in 1997, furnish a rolling two-year training implementation schedule to&#13;
the Bank and carry out the training under a program acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.50  Equipment. The responsibility for procurement of equipment would be divided&#13;
between the two executing agencies. PEO would be responsible for the procurement of&#13;
equipment related to UKH and the Traffic Police. XHAB would administer the&#13;
procurement of equipment for the maintenance of the highway network (other than UKH&#13;
and for the highway safety component). The equipment required for laboratories,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
strengthening of highway network maintenance, highway safety and institutional&#13;
strengthening would be procured at an early stage of project implementation (1996/97),&#13;
while that for the operation and maintenance of UKH is scheduled to be procured toward&#13;
the end of UKH construction (2000).&#13;
3.51  The project as a whole is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2001, with the&#13;
loan closing date stipulated as December 31, 2002. The implementation schedule for the&#13;
project is presented in Annex 7.&#13;
3.52 Operations of UKH. XCD intends to operate the new highway as a toll facility&#13;
consistent with its design. Tolls would be collected at eight points (Map IBRD 27623),&#13;
reflecting an open system for toll collection. To ensure that the toll rates would be&#13;
appropriately structured and that toll levels would not lead to a substantial reduction in&#13;
the benefits of highway investment, the rationale for setting the level of tolling would be&#13;
determined based on the findings of an analysis to be undertaken by the Region, which&#13;
takes into consideration latest experience with operation of toll roads in China as well as&#13;
similar studies done under Bank-financed highway projects in China. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations from XAR that XCD shall undertake, and by April 30, 2000,&#13;
complete and furnish to the Bank for its review and comments, an analysis and&#13;
recommendation for the toll rates on UKH taking into consideration the results of the&#13;
Toll Rate Study under the Bank-financed highway projects in China, as well as&#13;
experience with tolls on major roads in China.&#13;
3.53 Operation and Maintenance of UKH. UKH will be operated and maintained by&#13;
XHGHAB with headquarters in Urumqi. This bureau is expected to establish four&#13;
maintenance centers at Urumqi, Changji, Shihezi and Kuitun to maintain and operate&#13;
UKH. Construction of these centers as well as their equipment needs are included in the&#13;
proposed project. Following the institutional strengthening contained in the proposed&#13;
project, XHGHAB is expected to be capable of properly operating and maintaining UKH.&#13;
J. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.54  Procurement under the project would be carried out as shown in the following&#13;
table on the next page. The procurement arrangements for the project have taken into&#13;
account the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,"&#13;
published in January 1995 and revised in January 1996, as well as the experience gained&#13;
from previous Bank-financed highway projects. The documentation, for procurement,&#13;
which covers the prequalification of contractors, ICB and National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) for civil works, ICB for goods and consultant services contracts has been&#13;
standardized for Chinese conditions in cooperation between the Chinese government and&#13;
the Bank. Standard documents would be used for all relevant procurement processes&#13;
under the project.&#13;

3.55   Works. The civil works of UKH would be divided into 14 contract sections.&#13;
Electrical and mechanical works would be handled as one contract. Administration and&#13;
maintenance buildings, service areas and toll plazas would be carried out in four&#13;
contracts. The linking roads (four road sections) would be included in the corresponding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
main UKH contract sections because of the small size of the works involved. Contracts&#13;
for the 14 civil works contracts and for the electrical and mechanical works contracts for&#13;
the UKH with an estimated cost of $473.3 million would be procured under ICB.&#13;
Contracts would be bid on a slice and package basis; qualified firms would be allowed to&#13;
bid for more than one contract so as to attract international contractors and large Chinese&#13;
contractors. The contracts for electrical and mechanical works would be bid later during&#13;
the construction of the UKH. All contractors for the 14 ICB contracts for civil works&#13;
would be prequalified. The General Procurement Notice (GPN) for the project was&#13;
published in the UN Development Business, No. 424 on October 16, 1995. This GPN&#13;
served as a specific procurement notice for the civil works contracts for UKH (each&#13;
costing more than $10 million). For the remaining large contract for electromechanical&#13;
works, invitations to bid would be advertised as specific procurement notices in the UN&#13;
Development Business and/or well-known technical magazines, newspapers, and trade&#13;
publications of wide international circulation. Domestic contractors competing under&#13;
ICB would be eligible for a 7.5 percent price preference. Domestic contractors are&#13;
expected to be competitive for all contracts under this project. Each contract for works&#13;
estimated to cost $50,000,000 equivalent or more shall include the provisions for a&#13;
dispute review board set forth in the standard bidding documents for works referred to in&#13;
para. 2.12 of the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
(January 1995 and revised in January 1996).&#13;
3.56  Other works, including small service facilities (toll plazas, maintenance offices,&#13;
service and rest areas, administrative buildings, etc., estimated to cost about $33.5&#13;
million), highway maintenance (with a cost of $90.8 million) and most of the highway&#13;
safety program (with a cost of $3.8 million) would be awarded following NCB&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank. These works would involve contracts estimated to&#13;
cost less than $10 million per contract, up to an aggregate amount of about $128.1&#13;
million. Since these contracts are small in value and scattered throughout the Region and&#13;
would be implemented over a four-year period, ICB would therefore be neither justified&#13;
nor practical, but foreign firms would not be precluded from bidding. However, in the&#13;
case of very small contracts for highway safety programs and under special conditions to&#13;
be justified by XCD, force account could be used for the procurement of civil works with&#13;
a total estimated cost of 20 percent (about Y 7.4 million or about $0.9 million) of the total&#13;
cost of highway safety programs.&#13;
3.57  Equipment. Generally, all contracts for goods and equipment costing more than&#13;
$250,000 equivalent would be awarded under ICB. However, for equipment where the&#13;
number of suppliers is small, limited international bidding would be followed, in an&#13;
aggregate amount not exceeding $2.3 million. All other items or groups of items&#13;
covering minor maintenance equipment, laboratories, and research estimated to cost less&#13;
than $250,000 per contract package, in an aggregate amount not exceeding $1.6 million&#13;
would be procured following international shopping procedures on the basis of a&#13;
comparison of price quotations solicited from at least three suppliers (from at least two&#13;
countries) eligible under the Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Domestic manufactures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
competing under ICB would be eligible for a margin of preference in the comparison of&#13;
bids of 15 percent for goods, or the prevailing custom duties, whichever is lower.&#13;
3.58  Consultants. All consultants required for construction supervision (cost of $15.2&#13;
million), regional transport study (cost of $0.3 million), and staff training (cost of $1.8&#13;
million) would be selected and employed under terms and conditions acceptable to the&#13;
Bank in accordance with Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Local expertise&#13;
available in the various regional/provincial universities and institutes in the highway&#13;
subsector would be used as much as possible.&#13;
3.59  Advance Contracting. XCD requested advance contracting and retroactive&#13;
financing in the following areas:&#13;
(a)   Stabilization of Abandoned Mines. This would allow treatment of&#13;
settlement before the earth work commences in March, 1997. The amount&#13;
subject to retroactive financing is estimated at Y 20 million ($2.4 million).&#13;
This work will be procured according to NCB procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
(b)   Consultants for Supervision of Construction of UKH. This would&#13;
allow for training of local staff and start-up of supervision of construction&#13;
by the time contracts are signed with contractors. The amount subject to&#13;
retroactive financing is estimated at $1 million.&#13;
(c)   Laboratory Equipment for the Joint International/Local Supervision&#13;
Team. This would permit effective, timely supervison of construction.&#13;
The amount subject to retroactive financing is estimated at $0.15 million.&#13;
3.60  Agreement to the above three requests for advance contracting and retroactive&#13;
financing is recommended, subject to XCD completing all Bank requirements, including&#13;
those for procurement, environment and resettlement. The total amount subject to&#13;
retroactive financing is estimated at about $3.6 million. All of this amount would apply&#13;
to eligible expenditures after April 1, 1996.&#13;
3.61  Bank Review. Prior review procedures would be used for: (a) civil works&#13;
contracts with an estimated cost of $2 million (Y 17 million) or more; (b) equipment with&#13;
an estimated cost of more than $250,000 per contract; and (c) consulting services with an&#13;
estimated contract cost of more than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals. In&#13;
the case of consultancy service contracts, all terms of reference and single-source&#13;
selections, regardless of the value of the contract, are subject to prior review. Prior&#13;
review would apply to about 89 percent and 85 percent of the total contract values of&#13;
works and goods, respectively. For contracts below the above-mentioned limits, post-&#13;
review procedures would be followed.&#13;

K. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.62 The proposed Bank loan of $300 million would be disbursed over a period of&#13;
about six years, as follows:&#13;
Amount disbursed&#13;
Category                           ($ million)        Percent disbursed&#13;

IQoS                              .300.&#13;
3.63  To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account would be opened with an&#13;
authorized allocation of $25 million equivalent, the estimated average expenditures for a&#13;
four-month period. The account would be opened in US dollars in a bank acceptable to&#13;
the Bank, and managed by the project implementing agency.  Applications for&#13;
replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or whenever the&#13;
Special Account is drawn down to 50 percent of its initial deposit, whichever comes first.&#13;
A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Table 3.2, which takes into&#13;
consideration the project disbursement profile for transport projects in China and the&#13;
potential risks of delay in project implementation.&#13;
3.64 Disbursements would be made against authorized payment requests for work done&#13;
under priced contracts for the civil works and for the delivery and installation of the&#13;
equipment. Interim certification of civil works completed and costed at unit rates in the&#13;
contracts will be prepared by the contractors, reviewed by the supervision teams/units and&#13;
payments authorized by PEO/XHGHCA and XHAB. Retroactive financing of up to&#13;
$3.6 million would be applied to expenditures made after April 1, 1996, for stabilization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
works of abandoned mines ($2.4 million); consultants for supervision of construction of&#13;
the UKH and training of local supervision staff ($1.0 million); and for purchase of&#13;
laboratory equipment ($0.2 million). Disbursements for staff training in China or abroad&#13;
would be made from the Special Account against the actual costs of travel, subsistence&#13;
and tuition or training fees. For expenditures relating to contracts for works of $2 million&#13;
or less, training, force account, contracts for goods, each valued at $250,000 equivalent or&#13;
less, and contracts for services each valued at $100,000 equivalent or less for finns and&#13;
$50,000 equivalent or less for individuals, reimbursement would be made on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting SOEs would be retained&#13;
by the implementing agencies and made available for review by the Bank supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
L. AUDITING&#13;
3.65  The Foreign Investment Audit Bureau of the State Auditing Administration&#13;
(SAA) would be responsible for auditing of project expenditures. Assurances were&#13;
obtained from XAR during negotiations that the project accounts and the Special&#13;
Accounts, including SOEs, would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank and that audit reports would be sent to the Bank for review within six months of the&#13;
close of each fiscal year. In the case of the SOEs, the audit report would contain a&#13;
separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year,&#13;
together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be&#13;
relied upon to support the related withdrawals. The Bank Group currently accepts SAA&#13;
audits for this purpose.&#13;
M. PROJECT SUPERVISION, REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
3.66  Supervision. The project would be supervised through Bank missions whose&#13;
frequency would be guided by the progress of the works. However, on the average, a&#13;
mission at about nine-month intervals would be mounted; a Supervision Mission Plan is&#13;
presented in Annex 8. In addition to field missions, staff input would be provided at&#13;
Headquarters for project-related activities such as completion of supervision reports,&#13;
procurement documentation and contracts, staff training and equipment proposals and&#13;
follow-up and review of the studies on highway safety and on operation and maintenance&#13;
of high-grade highways. Moreover, the Bank would monitor progress of implementation&#13;
of all project components through quarterly progress reports to be submitted to the Bank.&#13;
In addition, XCD would submit to the Bank monthly reports on progress of civil works&#13;
for UKH. It is estimated that over the implementation period of the project the total time&#13;
expended on supervision would be in the order of 70 person-weeks.&#13;
3.67  Monitoring.  During implementation, project performance, including the&#13;
achievement of physical targets and attainment of other project objectives will be&#13;
monitored by PEO through the use of performance indicators, reports on the environment&#13;
and land acquisition and resettlement, progress reports and auditing of project accounts.&#13;
In addition, upon completion, the project will be reviewed in an Implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Completion Report. Annex 9 presents the proposed monitoring indicators for the project.&#13;
Each of the project components' indices will track annual progress in attaining targets&#13;
during implementation and impact objectives after the project is completed. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that XAR shall, by March 31 of each year commencing in&#13;
1997 and ending three years after completion of the project, furnish to the Bank an&#13;
annual monitoring report, in a format acceptable to the Bank, covering all components of&#13;
the project, in conformance with the monitoring indicators.&#13;
3.68  Reporting. Based on the monitoring activities described in Annex 9, PEO will&#13;
submit to the Bank an annual monitoring report. This report will be based on the&#13;
following reports, which will be submitted to the Bank during the course of a given year:&#13;
(a)   Annual environmental monitoring reports during the construction phase&#13;
and the first three years of the operation phase of UKH (para. 3.34).&#13;
(b)   A  series of internal and external (independent) monitoring reports&#13;
assessing the impact of land acquisition and resettlement on various&#13;
segments of the local population, describing the income restoration&#13;
strategies followed and the number of people rehabilitated (para. 3.38 and&#13;
Annex ).&#13;
(c)   Annual audit reports for the project accounts and financial statements&#13;
(para. 3.65).&#13;
(d)   Quarterly progress reports for all project activities and up-to-date&#13;
performance indicators (para. 3.66).&#13;
(e)   A report, by an independent agency/expert, on the completion of the&#13;
highway safety component within six months of the completion of this&#13;
component.&#13;
(f)   A Project Implementation Completion Report would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the loan closing date.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
4.1   The economic evaluation focuses on the Urumqi-Kuitun Highway (UKH) and&#13;
Highway Maintenance components of the project, which account for 85 percent of the&#13;
total project costs. The four linking roads to the UKH are all relatively short, with a total&#13;
length of 18.8 km, and since they are essential to the functioning of the UKH, have been&#13;
included in its evaluation. The other linking roads using existing roads do not need to be&#13;
improved.&#13;
A. BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES&#13;
4.2   The existing road from Urumqi to Kuitun is heavily congested on the first 64 km&#13;
from Urumqi to the starting point of the Wugontai-Karamay road, from which point the&#13;
traffic level reduces by about half. Congestion on the second section of the road is&#13;
presently lower, but even on this section of the road, traffic will exceed the estimated&#13;
capacity before the proposed UKH is open.&#13;
4.3   The existing road is built to Class I standards as far as Changji (29.2 km), to Class&#13;
II auto-only standards from Changji to Wugongtai (48.5 km), and to Class II (all users)&#13;
standards throughout the remainder. The need for additional capacity is therefore similar&#13;
through the length of the corridor, despite the higher present traffic level on the section&#13;
nearest to Urumqi. There is a high proportion of truck traffic on the existing highway,&#13;
with 11 percent of vehicles being truck-trailers, 17 percent being large trucks, and 27&#13;
percent being medium trucks, mostly associated with coal- and petroleum-related&#13;
industries.  These two products account for more than 40 percent of the freight&#13;
transported in large trucks and 32 percent of the medium truck freight. The continued&#13;
development of the petroleum, petrochemical and metallurgical industries in the vicinity&#13;
will depend on the availability of good transport access to Urumqi, and this in turn will&#13;
depend on the provision of new capacity.&#13;
4.4   The proposed UKH would form part of the principal transport corridor linking the&#13;
eastern provinces of China with central Asia (Russia and Kazakhstan) and through them&#13;
to Europe. The proposed UKH would improve the prospects for significant growth in&#13;
international trade between the western regions and provinces of China and central Asian&#13;
countries with which they have long historic cultural links. A study of transport linkages&#13;
with neighboring countries and provinces, as well as within Xinjiang, is included as part&#13;
of the project and will identify further transport policy or investment measures needed to&#13;
stimulate international trade.&#13;
4.5   In addition to the benefits of reduced vehicle operating costs, which in turn will&#13;
lead to economic and trade development prospects, provision of a divided highway will&#13;
reduce the present very high accident rate. This high rate is a consequence of the high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
traffic volume/capacity ratio on a single carriageway road, which reduces the&#13;
opportunities for one vehicle to safely pass another. The high proportion of relatively&#13;
slow moving trucks leads drivers of faster moving vehicles to take additional risks in&#13;
order to avoid being delayed. If the UKH is not built, the number of risk situations will&#13;
increase faster than the rate of growth of traffic.&#13;
4.6   The proposed project will also finance a significant proportion of the agreed&#13;
highway maintenance program for the Region. Completion of this program is expected&#13;
to improve the average value of the index of highway surface condition (International&#13;
Roughness Index, IRI) from its current level of 6.7 to about 5.6 mm per m. Agreements&#13;
on annual maintenance activities and monitoring of highway revenues and expenditures&#13;
are expected to ensure that adequate funds are allocated to maintenance, despite the need&#13;
to add to highway capacity during a period of expected high economic growth and levels&#13;
of motorization.&#13;
B. URUMQI-KUITUN HIGHWAY&#13;
4.7   The Existing Corridor. The proposed UKH is part of the highway network&#13;
centered on Urumqi that has consistently been identified as important to the economic&#13;
growth of the region. The area that would be served by the proposed road includes a&#13;
present population of about 3.8 million, or about 22 percent of the XAR total. However,&#13;
as its importance in industrial and agricultural production is greater than in proportion to&#13;
its population, it accounts for almost half the Regional total for GOVAI. The Region as a&#13;
whole has experienced high economic growth, averaging more than 10 percent per year&#13;
for the last 15 years. The imminent opening of new production facilities, such as a high&#13;
capacity ethylene and alkyl-benzene works, is expected to reestablish the high economic&#13;
growth of a decade ago and result in a large increase in demand for transport&#13;
4.8   Urumqi-Kazakstan Railway. The railway that parallels the line of the proposed&#13;
UKH is operating at substantially less than its full capacity, transporting some 1.58&#13;
million tons and 0.56 million passengers in 1994. The total length of the line from the&#13;
border with Kazakstan to Urumqi is 456 km and from Kuitun to Urumqi, the section&#13;
relevant as a possible alternative to construction of the UKH, is only 222 km. Rail&#13;
transport is inefficient compared with road transport over these short distances, and the&#13;
line is not aimed at such local traffic but, rather, at that traveling the longer distances to&#13;
Beijing and other cities in the coastal provinces. Less than 25 percent of the projected&#13;
traffic on the UKH will have trip lengths such that rail transport could be a viable&#13;
alternative. Some of this freight might in the long term transfer to rail, but only when the&#13;
combined Xinjiang and MOR operation can be made more attractive to the relatively&#13;
small loads that travel by road, and this is not expected to come about within the next 10&#13;
years.&#13;
4.9   Traffic on the Existing Road. In 1995, traffic between Urumqi and Hutubi&#13;
(90 km from Urumqi) was more than two and half times higher than six years earlier&#13;
(Table 4.1) , while on the section between Hutubi and Kuitun, traffic was about double&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
the earlier level, representing average annual growth rates of more than 17 percent and 14&#13;
percent respectively. However, growth in the last five years has been much lower, at 13&#13;
percent and 6 percent on each of the sections. The lower recent growth can be attributed&#13;
to a slow down in the coal, petroleum and petrochemical industries, which is now being&#13;
overcome with the construction of new capacity and facilities. Traffic already exceeds&#13;
the design capacity throughout the Class II section of the existing road and will soon do&#13;
the same for the Class I section in the Urumqi urban area. Table 4.1 shows the present&#13;
and projected traffic levels in the corridor.&#13;
4.10  Traffic Projections. Traffic projections for the proposed highway take into&#13;
account expected population growth, increases in real incomes that lead to higher demand&#13;
for travel and higher levels of motorization, and increases in mineral and petroleum&#13;
output and agricultural and industrial production that will lead to increased freight&#13;
transport demand. They also account for the generation of new demand as a consequence&#13;
of construction of the proposed road.&#13;
4.11   The population of Xinjiang increased at an average annual rate of almost 2 percent&#13;
between 1982 and 1995, with the highest rate of 2.5 percent in the period 1990 to 1995.&#13;
The population of Urumqi has grown slightly faster, that of Kuitun much faster at more&#13;
than 12 percent per year, while that of the region between Urumqi and Kuitun has grown&#13;
rather slower. Projections of the population of Urumqi are for a growth of about 1.8&#13;
percent per year until 2000, slowing to 1.25 percent until the end of the study period&#13;
(2020). For Kuitun they are 3.0 percent and 1.7 percent, while for the intermediate area&#13;
they are 1.3 percent and 1.4 percent in each of the periods.&#13;
4.12  The economy of the area of influence of the proposed highway is expected to&#13;
grow about 20 percent faster than the 12 percent, 10 percent and 7 percent projection for&#13;
the whole of Xinjiang in the periods 1995 to 2000, 2000 to 2010, and 2010 to 2020. The&#13;
basis for these high projections of growth are the expected developments of agricultural&#13;
production, with a returning to profitability of cotton and textile production, petroleum&#13;
production and refining and associated petrochemical industries. Industrial production&#13;
with a focus on export-oriented industries is also expected to grow faster than the regional&#13;
and national averages, as are industries related to construction and mining. Generated&#13;
traffic is estimated to add 6 percent to the base level of traffic, with 10 percent for trips&#13;
that would travel the full length of the corridor and 4 percent for those making use of the&#13;
new road for shorter distances. The results of the traffic projections indicate an average&#13;
growth rate from 1995 to 2000 of about 14 percent, largely the result of an increase in&#13;
real incomes, reducing to just over 8 percent from 2000 to 2010 and to rather more than 4&#13;
percent from 2010 to 2020 (Table 4.1).&#13;
4.13   The proportion of traffic using the proposed new highway was estimated taking&#13;
account of the lower vehicle operating costs and shorter travel times that would result, as&#13;
well as the tolls that would need to be paid by users of the road. In the early years of&#13;
operation, when congestion on the existing road would be a deterrent to its use,&#13;
84 percent of corridor traffic is expected to use the new road, except within the Urumqi&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
urban area where it would be only about 78 percent because of the larger number of&#13;
alternative routes available. However, as traffic levels on the new road increase, the time&#13;
advantage in comparison with the existing road would reduce, so the expected proportion&#13;
of traffic diverting to the road would also reduce to between 65 percent and 80 percent by&#13;
the year 2020 (Table 4.2).&#13;
4.14  The Proposed New Highway. The projected volumes of traffic indicate that the&#13;
new highway should be built to full Expressway standards, that is, a four-lane divided&#13;
highway with access control outside the urban area of Urumqi, whereas within the urban&#13;
area, the 17.4 km section from Urabo to Xishan should be built as a Class II access&#13;
controlled highway, and the 13.2 km section from Xishan to West Station as a Class I&#13;
highway. Traffic volumes and economic evaluations indicate that three of the four&#13;
linking roads should be built to Class II standards, but it is proposed to build the fourth&#13;
linking road, that to Manasi, to the same Class II standard to retain operational&#13;
consistency.&#13;
4.15  Alternative alignments. Considerations taken into account in the location of the&#13;
route included geology, the location of worked and unworked coal seams, risk of&#13;
earthquakes, the need to provide a route easily accessible to the intermediate cities and&#13;
towns without constructing a barrier to their future development, hydrology including the&#13;
need to minimize interference with irrigation canals, and the location of agricultural&#13;
production units.&#13;
4.16  Alternative alignments were considered for the location of the Urumqi urban&#13;
section, including the linking road from Shangshahe to West Station, the section from&#13;
West Station to Wugongtai, the section close to Shihezi and the location of the ending&#13;
point close to Kuitun. The economic evaluations of alternatives shown in Table 4.4 were&#13;
considered together with social and environmnental issues in selecting the preferred&#13;
alignments from the alternatives considered.&#13;
4.17  Interchanges. It is proposed to provide 16 interchanges along the 267 km length&#13;
of the UKH, including those at the start and end, an average of 1 every 17 kin, although 5&#13;
would be located in the first 30 km within the Urumqi urban area. In addition, there&#13;
would be 32 grade-separated crossings of highways, railways and urban roads. The&#13;
intersections in the urban area are where the proposed highway would cross other&#13;
principal roads (two of the interchanges would connect with the TUDH) and elsewhere&#13;
they are provided for each locality that would generate significant volumes of traffic.&#13;
4.18  Link Roads. Most of the proposed interchanges would be located where the&#13;
UKH would cross existing highways, so construction of new link roads or improvement&#13;
of existing link roads would not be necessary. The four exceptions where link roads&#13;
would be necessary were subject to a detailed operational, economic and social&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
4.19 Economic Evaluation. Economic analyses, based on April 1995 price levels,&#13;
were carried out for the route as a whole and for each of its 13 sections. Construction of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
the highway was assumed to start in 1997 and be completed by the end of 2000, and the&#13;
economic life of the highway to be 20 years with a residual value of 50 percent of the&#13;
original cost. Project costs included annual maintenance and operation of the toll system,&#13;
and periodic maintenance (pavement overlay) in the tenth year of operation. Economic&#13;
costs were derived from financial costs by eliminating taxes, duties and price&#13;
contingencies and by applying shadow prices to construction materials.&#13;
4.20  Benefits of the highway were assumed to accrue from savings in vehicle operating&#13;
costs, reductions in travel time and reduced accident costs, this last benefit being&#13;
quantified only in terms of reduced vehicle damage cost savings. Vehicle operating costs&#13;
were assumed to vary with the type of vehicle, average speed of traffic and Class of road&#13;
(higher costs for a given speed on Class III and Class IV roads), the condition (roughness)&#13;
of the road surface, and the horizontal and vertical alignment of the road. A comparison&#13;
between the computed vehicle operating costs on a road network similar to that currently&#13;
provided and the results of a survey of actual vehicle maintenance costs indicated a&#13;
difference of less than 5 percent.&#13;
4.21 Sensitivity tests. Sensitivity tests were carried out for three alternatives for each&#13;
of the linkages to the Urumqi Transit Road, three alternatives for the section of road&#13;
between Urumqi and Changji, and for each of the four proposed new link roads. The&#13;
basic evaluation made use of the lowest of the three projected traffic levels and assumed&#13;
that tolls would be charged at a level that would balance economic and financial&#13;
considerations. Sensitivity tests were made with a higher demand projection, with tolls&#13;
that optimized financial returns as well as a situation with no tolls, and with a zero&#13;
valuation of travel time savings to vehicle occupants.. Further sensitivity tests were&#13;
carried out with increases of costs of up to 20 percent, reductions of benefits of up to 20&#13;
percent and combinations of these value. Probabilities were assigned to each different&#13;
combination of costs and benefits, and an expected value of the economic rate of return&#13;
derived from them.&#13;
4.22  Economic evaluation results. The economic evaluation of the proposed project&#13;
as a whole yielded a best estimate EIRR of 20.6 percent and a probability weighted EIRR&#13;
of 19.3 percent. For the EIRR value to fall below the threshold value of 12 percent, costs&#13;
would need to be at least 25 percent higher than estimated at the same time as benefits&#13;
would need to be at least 25 percent lower than estimated. The probability of this&#13;
outcome was assessed at less than 4 percent. The weights used in determining the&#13;
probability weighted result ("Expected" EIRR) are shown in Table 4.4, together with the&#13;
contribution of each element to the overall result.&#13;
4.23  The basic EIRR values for each of the 13 road sections were between 16 percent&#13;
and 23 percent, with the lower values generally being for the sections of road further from&#13;
Urumqi (Table 4.4). The selected alternative for connection to the Urumqi Transit Road&#13;
as a Class II Highway to be built in a single stage had an EIRR in excess of 27 percent&#13;
and the selected alignment for the section between Urumqi and Wugontai in excess of 20&#13;
percent. Three of the proposed link roads had an EIRR in excess of 25 percent, while the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
fourth (that to Manasi) with only a marginally acceptable EIRR of 12.1 percent, was&#13;
included in the project because of the additional benefits it would bring to local traffic&#13;
which were not included in the evaluation. Elimination of the benefits of time savings&#13;
showed a reduction in the EIRR to 18.5 percent.&#13;
4.24 Effect of tolls. A toll of about 16 fen/veh-km (US 1.7 cents veh-km) would be&#13;
sufficient to finance loan amortization charges. This level of toll is substantially lower&#13;
than those presently being applied on toll roads in coastal provinces. The sensitivity tests&#13;
with respect to operation of the road without tolls showed an increase in the EIRR to 23&#13;
percent. Sensitivity tests to the level of tolls (Table 4.5) showed that even at a toll of&#13;
about 42 fen/veh-km (about US 5 cents at December 1995 prices), the EIRR is still within&#13;
75 percent of its maximum value and the FIRR has almost reached its maximum. Above&#13;
this level of toll, the EIRR falls rapidly while the FIRR also falls as the cross-elasticity of&#13;
demand becomes greater than 1.0, so a proportionate increase in toll produces a less than&#13;
proportionate increase in revenue.&#13;
4.25  The level of tolls would be established just before opening of the road, and would&#13;
take account of the conflicting objectives of recovering sufficient revenue to finance loan&#13;
amortization charges while not deterring a high proportion of traffic from using the road&#13;
and thereby reducing its economic benefits. The toll will also take account of users&#13;
concerns that they should not be charged twice for construction of the proposed highway,&#13;
once through the toll and again through the Road Maintenance Fee (RMF), part of which&#13;
is allocated to new road construction. It is this concern that has led to the current&#13;
preference to set the toll level to cover only the loan amortization cost and not that part of&#13;
the cost financed by the RMF. Private finance of the full construction cost would require&#13;
a toll of about 50 fen/veh-km (US 6 cents) to give an acceptable rate of return to&#13;
providers of both debt and equity, and this level would substantially reduce the economic&#13;
benefits of the project. XHGHCA would submit to the Bank by April 30, 2000, a study&#13;
of the tolls to be charged.&#13;
4.26  Financial Evaluation. It is intended that the UKH be operated as a toll road,&#13;
with an open tolling system. This would result in greater cost savings than revenue losses&#13;
in comparison with a closed toll system. There would be three on-route toll stations, at&#13;
Changji, Manasi and Kuitun, and five on-ramp toll stations, at Bagang, Changji,&#13;
Wulawusu, Shawan, and Anjihai interchanges.&#13;
4.27  Although the net present value of toll revenues exceeds that of loan amortization&#13;
payments, the cash flow from toll revenues would generate sufficient funds in the early&#13;
years of the project to finance amortization payments based on a conventional Bank&#13;
repayment schedule of equal repayments throughout the period of the loan. Since the&#13;
revenue would be much higher in the later years of the project, the repayment schedule on&#13;
which the toll rate was determined more closely paralleled the revenue stream from toll&#13;
payments. In addition, the toll revenues are calculated in money rather than real terms,&#13;
since the loan amortization payments are independent of inflation, but the revenues will&#13;
depend on how tolls are adjusted to keep up with inflation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
4.28  Highway Maintenance. The 30 sub-projects proposed for the first year of the&#13;
highway maintenance program, covering a total road length of 562 km, have also been&#13;
subjected to an economic evaluation. The sub-projects were of two types, a 40-mm&#13;
asphalt concrete overlay, to be applied to 57 percent of the length ("overlay"), and a 60-m&#13;
asphalt concrete overlay and a 200-mm base course ("strengthening") for the remainder.&#13;
The evaluated benefits of the sub-projects included reduced vehicle operating costs and&#13;
routine highway maintenance costs. The mean EIRR for these first year sub-projects was&#13;
92 percent with a standard deviation of 44 percent, and a range from 14 percent to more&#13;
than 400 percent, with similar values for each of the two types of sub-project. These high&#13;
EIRR values indicate that higher expenditure on periodic maintenance would be justified,&#13;
as is proposed in the highway improvement program of the XHAB, which includes many&#13;
periodic maintenance activities as part of broader improvements.&#13;
C. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
4.29  The principal risks are related to implementation delay, lack of counterpart funds&#13;
and insufficient institutional capacity. Based on the experience of the ongoing XHP1,&#13;
these risks are lower in Xinjiang than in other provinces and regions. The risk of cost&#13;
overruns is small, given the relatively easy geological conditions of the area in which the&#13;
road would be constructed and the strong management of XHGHCA. Experience with&#13;
XHGHCA during the implementation of the TUDH has been excellent, their having&#13;
demonstrated not only strong management, but also an ability to ensure adequate and&#13;
timely availability of finance. The perception of risk of a lack of counterpart funds arise&#13;
from two considerations. First, the projected future revenues of the highway sector&#13;
include borrowing and an assumed strong economic growth and consequent increase in&#13;
the number of vehicles to generate revenue to amortize the loans. Should the expected&#13;
rate of growth not come about, sector revenues would not reach their projected levels, but&#13;
borrowing and repayment commitments would already have been made. The Region's&#13;
highway sector might therefore find itself unable to meet its counterpart financing&#13;
obligations.&#13;
4.30  Second, the conditionality of the proposed project requires a significant increase&#13;
in expenditure on maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing highway network. This&#13;
network was not designed for the volumes of traffic or weights of trucks now using it. If&#13;
the planned rehabilitation does not take place, the condition of the network will quickly&#13;
deteriorate to unacceptable levels.  The combination of increased maintenance&#13;
expenditure, loan amortization payments, and counterpart funding obligations will&#13;
consume almost all the projected sector revenue, even if the expected economic growth&#13;
does take place. Any increase in maintenance and construction costs will rapidly take up&#13;
the small margin of projected revenue over expenditure and put in risk all of the proposed&#13;
investments.&#13;
4.31  Fortunately, the sector agencies are aware of this risk and are proposing&#13;
institutional changes that will go far in ensuring that adequate funds are available. The&#13;
proposals would convert XHGHCA into a highways operating rather than a highways&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
construction agency, possibly with responsibilities for more than just the high-grade&#13;
highways that is presently responsible for constructing. With revenue and expenditure&#13;
for the whole highways sector under a single agency, the risks of inadequate financing&#13;
would be greatly reduced.&#13;
4.32  Specific measures to reduce project risks would include:&#13;
(a)   intensive review of final designs both by independent international&#13;
consultants and Bank staff before Project approval by the Board, to&#13;
minimize the risk of subsequent changes;&#13;
(b)   intensive supervision of construction both by local staff of XHGHCA and&#13;
intemational consultants to ensure strict adherence to designs and&#13;
materials quality; and&#13;
(c)   annual review and agreement by the Bank of the proposed highway&#13;
maintenance program and budget for the subsequent year, as well as a&#13;
detailed review of the previous years performance.&#13;
4.33  It is possible that should traffic volumes and toll revenues on the new UKH fail to&#13;
meet expectations, XHGHCA would be tempted to discourage use of the existing road by&#13;
imposing tolls or failing to undertake adequate maintenance. The risk of failure of the&#13;
new road to attract sufficient traffic to provide adequate toll revenue will be reduced by&#13;
ensuring that all cost effective measures are taken to increase attractiveness of the new&#13;
road while not reducing that of the existing road. These measures would include&#13;
provision of safety features to reduce accidents and service and rest areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.1   Agreement was reached with the Central Government at negotiations that it would&#13;
make the proceeds of the loan available to XAR on the same terms as those of the Bank&#13;
loan to it: 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the same rate payable to the Bank by&#13;
the Borrower, with 0.75 percent per year commitment fee on the outstanding balance,&#13;
beginning 60 days after signing, less any waiver (para. 3.42).&#13;

and for each of the first three years following completion of construction&#13;
(para. 3.34).&#13;
(f)   All land acquisition and resettlement activities with respect to UKH, and&#13;
its linking roads would be completed according to the RAPs in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.37).&#13;
(g)   XAR shall, for UKH, furnish to the Bank: (i) by March 31 and September&#13;
30 of each year starting September 30, 1996, internal monitoring reports&#13;

Bank regarding the implementation and input of the resettlement activities&#13;
during the previous six months and carry out the monitoring of the&#13;
effectiveness and socioeconomic impact of the resettlement process for&#13;
UKH and its linking roads according to the monitoring plan in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.38).&#13;
(h)   XAR shall, by October 31 of each year commencing in 1997, furnish the&#13;

(i)   XAR shall undertake and, by April 30, 2000, complete and furnish to the&#13;
Bank for its review and comments, an analysis and recommendation for&#13;
the toll rates on the UKH, taking into consideration the results of the Toll&#13;
Rate Studies under the Bank-financed highway projects in China, as well&#13;
as experience with tolls on major roads in China (para. 3.52).&#13;
(j)   The project accounts and the Special Accounts, including SOEs, would be&#13;
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that audit&#13;

ANNEX 1: HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM&#13;
1.   In order to help address Xinjiang's highway maintenance problems, XCD carried&#13;
out a highway network maintenance study financed under XHPI. The study proposed a&#13;
four-year Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program (periodic maintenance) based on an&#13;
annual budget ceiling of about Y 185 million, which would provide the basis for selection&#13;
of actual road lengths to be included in the highway maintenance program under the&#13;
proposed XHP2. The highway maintenance and rehabilitation program would be aimed&#13;
at stabilizing the conditions of the existing network at a maintainable level by&#13;
reconstruction of seriously deteriorated highway sections and by overlay rehabilitation of&#13;
most needed sections.&#13;
2.    Implementation. The highway maintenance and rehabilitation program would be&#13;
executed from 1977 onwards to 2000 with about the same level of expenditures each year&#13;
(Table 1). It was agreed that XHAB would carry out detailed engineering investigation&#13;
and design of all highway sections to be included in the four-year program. The format&#13;
of the engineering design will follow the national standard used by XHAB for highway&#13;
rehabilitation, and will among others include plan and profile drawings, pavement design&#13;
and details of drainage structures. The roads to be included in the first year program&#13;
(1997), are shown in Table 2, identifying each contract, the name and sections of road to&#13;
be improved, the type of improvement intervention, the estimated costs and Economic&#13;
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) for each road.&#13;
3.    Selection of Road Sections. The selection of roads was based on the analysis and&#13;
the recommendations made in the Xinjiang Highway Maintenance Study (XHMS). The&#13;
study was carried out by XHAB, assisted by experts from the Finnish National Road&#13;
Administration (FinnRA), between November 1994 and December 1995. The Final&#13;
Report of the study was completed on January 10, 1996. The study analyses were based&#13;
on the use of the latest versions of the HDM-III software and the China Pavement&#13;
Management System (CPMS). Road conditions and other basic data needed to run the&#13;
models were collected by XHAB, and included:&#13;
(a)   Paved Roads (9,721 kin)&#13;
* distress data by a visual survey for each kilometer;&#13;
* deflection data by Benkelman Beam measurement, for every 100 m;&#13;
and&#13;
* roughness survey by Bump Integrators, calibrated to obtain the real IRI&#13;
values.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
(b)   Gravel Roads (4,935 km)&#13;
* road width and shoulder width;&#13;
* gravel thickness and age; and&#13;
&#149; material properties for surface, base and subgrade.&#13;
In addition, data were collected for traffic volumes, vehicle weights, vehicle operating&#13;
costs as well as geometric and enviromnental data.&#13;
4.    For the HDM-III analysis, the road network was divided into representative&#13;
sections in the database, based on pavement type, traffic volume, roughness and&#13;
deflection for paved roads, and road classification, gravel thickness and type of terrains&#13;
for gravel roads. The whole network included 24 homogenous segments with asphalt&#13;
concrete, 32 with surface treatment and 16 gravel. Four different maintenance strategies&#13;
were considered for paved roads in addition to normal routine maintenance: (i) resealing&#13;
(10 or 25 mm), (ii) overlay (25,40 or 60 mm), (iii) strengthening with 25 mm surface&#13;
treatment and 200 mm base course, and (iv) strengthening with 20, 40, or 60 mm asphalt&#13;
concrete and 200 mm gravel base course. For gravel roads, the maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation options included grading, spot regravelling, regravelling and upgrading to&#13;
surface treatment.&#13;
5.    The basic screening of various maintenance and rehabilitation options was done&#13;
using the HDM-III model. The optimization of maintenance interventions took into&#13;
account the cost of routine maintenance, overlay cost, strengthening cost and the resulting&#13;
vehicle operating costs to select investments with the highest discounted benefits.&#13;
Several runs were made with the HDM-III model to prepare the four-year (1997-2000)&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation program with a budget limitation of Y 185 million per&#13;
year. The objectives of the selection process were three-fold:&#13;
(a)   to select one or two feasible maintenance actions for each section of the&#13;
road network;&#13;
(b)   for each section to schedule one or two of the most feasible maintenance&#13;
actions into the four-year period (1997-2000); and&#13;
(c)   to optimize the net benefits of the investments by selecting an optimal set&#13;
of maintenance actions for the four-year period (1997-2000).&#13;
Two categories of roads, totaling about 2,500 km, were excluded from the HDM-111&#13;
analysis:&#13;
(d)   roads in excellent condition, which obviously do not need any&#13;
maintenance intervention during the four-year (1997-2000) period, i.e.,&#13;
where normal routine maintenance activities would be sufficient.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71-                     ANNEX 1&#13;
(e)   roads in poor condition, but having such low traffic volumes that any&#13;
investment in the four-year (1997-2000) period would be obviously&#13;
uneconomical.&#13;
6.    The final output of XHMS was a proposed four-year maintenance program at a&#13;
total cost of Y 742 million. The program was presented in a matrix format, showing road&#13;
lengths and maintenance interventions for each homogenous road segment, all with an&#13;
EIRR higher than 32 percent. In general, the high roughness on existing paved roads, did&#13;
not allow a choice of resealings or thin overlays. An asphalt concrete overlay was&#13;
selected for the better road sections with less deflection and roughness. The poorest&#13;
sections with very high deflections and roughness were selected for strengthening. The&#13;
analysis of gravel roads revealed that it was not feasible at this stage to upgrade any&#13;
section to paved standard (surface treatment), even though some had relatively high&#13;
traffic figures. The main reason was that upgrading costs would be high due to the&#13;
remote location of these sections, and to avoid damage from frequent flooding and&#13;
landslides.&#13;
7.    Project component includes financing of a four-year (1997-2000) Highway&#13;
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program (MRP) that covers 2,450 km, or about 78&#13;
percent of the total cost of the whole four-year program referred to in paragraph 6 above.&#13;
The individual road sections shown in Table 2 were selected from the proposed four-year&#13;
program in matrix format in XHMS. In the selection of sections, engineering and&#13;
practical aspects of implementation, such as packaging of contracts, location and need for&#13;
a uniform standard of sections were taken into account. Also, the administrative aspect&#13;
was considered in relation to contract packaging, as the design and supervision&#13;
organization would reflect the geographical division between the relevant highway&#13;
county bureaus. Consequently, the first year maintenance and rehabilitation program&#13;
would include 12 contracts to be procured under NCB. The overall EIRR of the first year&#13;
program was estimated to about 92 percent.&#13;
8.    Monitoring and Key Indicators of Success:  Recorded average surface&#13;
roughness (IRI) of the paved highway network is an indication of the serviceability of the&#13;
region's highway network. The four-year Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program is&#13;
envisaged to result in improved serviceability. The road surface roughness on the paved&#13;
road network is estimated to improve from a present average IRI of 6.7 mm/m to about&#13;
5.6 mm/m after the four-year program. The proportional reduction in the total transport&#13;
cost would be greater, as the improved road lengths would carry more than average&#13;
traffic. The Bank and XCD would, during each year's supervision mission, review the&#13;
maintenance activities undertaken during the previous year, and compare the results with&#13;
those agreed in the previous year, and agree on the periodic maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation program for the following year. The average road surface roughness on the&#13;
paved road network would be surveyed once a year and would serve as an indicator of&#13;
achievement of the objective of improved serviceability.&#13;

standards to pursue a quota-wage system, and train and certify professional staff in charge&#13;
of quota standards and budget.&#13;
Telecommunications Information Center (TIC)&#13;
6.    The TIC of XCD was founded in 1993 by approval of XAR. It is within the&#13;
jurisdiction of XCD, as well as a Class II long distance telecommunication station of&#13;
MOC. The authorized establishment of the TIC is 35; at the present time only 9 staff are&#13;
available. The TIC is responsible for radio communication system within the jurisdiction&#13;
of XCD, telecommunications and information network among highway management&#13;
agencies in Xinjiang and all over China, and planning, construction and management of&#13;
Class III, Class IV telecommunication stations within the jurisdiction of XCD.&#13;
Xinjiang Communications Technical Workers School (XCTWS)&#13;
7.    The role of XCTWS, a vocational school, is to train qualified technical workers&#13;
for XCD institutions. Founded in 1953, the school started as a training center for vehicle&#13;
operators and drivers. In 1984, its scope was broadened to repair and maintenance of&#13;
highway construction and maintenance equipment. In 1990, the program was expanded&#13;
to include technical training for highway construction and maintenance.&#13;
Xinjiang Communications School (XCS)&#13;
8.    XCS was established in 1982. The school is the sole polytechnic institution&#13;
addressing technician-level needs in the transportation sector. Its basic role is to train&#13;
technical and management personnel in the fields of highway, automobile, planning and&#13;
statistics, financial affairs and accounting for XCD and its subdivisions. The school also&#13;
prepares for preuniversity entry at Xian Highway Institute. Up to 1991, students were&#13;
admitted on the basis of selection criteria; since that date the school recruits at the level of&#13;
counties, and as a result there is a higher proportion of attendees from the 17 poorer&#13;
counties in the Xinjiang Region. The school currently benefits from support under&#13;
XHP1.&#13;

ANNEX 3: HIGHWAY SAFETY PROGRAM&#13;
1.    The accident situation in Xinjiang (as in other provinces in China) is serious. A&#13;
total of 4,490 accidents was reported in 1994, which is not high, but this may reflect a&#13;
low degree of reporting of accidents, especially in rural areas. However, the number&#13;
killed (1,712) and injured (2,884) is high, and the rate of 76 killed per 10,000 motor&#13;
vehicles is high and is about 25 times higher than that for Western European and North&#13;
American countries. Also, the severity rate (37 percent), defined as the number killed&#13;
divided by the total number killed and injured is also high.&#13;
2.    Due to this situation, the Bank is financing the road safety improvement program&#13;
under XHP 1. Hence, a variety of programs and activities related to highway safety have&#13;
been taking place. However, these programs and activities have been undertaken&#13;
independently and without proper coordination between XCD and the Public Security&#13;
Bureau (Traffic Police).  The most serious deficiency is the lack of a long-term&#13;
comprehensive planning in the field of highway safety. A major objective of the&#13;
proposed highway safety component under XHP2 would therefore, be strengthening of&#13;
the capacity for policy-making and planning among the relevant agencies. In this regard,&#13;
the development of regular highway safety planning and coordination, which would be a&#13;
prerequisite for the efficient comprehensive highway safety program, should be started&#13;
first. The pilot work on black spots improvement, which was proposed under XHPI&#13;
should be continued. This kind of work has proven that it would be one of the most&#13;
efficient activities in relation to highway safety. Also, the intensive training or accident&#13;
statistics would greatly contribute to the development of capacity of analyzing the&#13;
relationship between accidents and accident contributing factors.&#13;
Present Situation&#13;
3.   It was observed that the existing accident data collection system is adequate for&#13;
the time being, even though there is room for improvement, especially the development&#13;
of software for further analyses. The present system was improved a few years ago and is&#13;
used in all provinces in China, and hence it is not subject to local modifications.&#13;
Highway Safety Policy and Planning&#13;
4.    A Leading Group for Highway Safety Planning. It was agreed to establish a&#13;
Leading Group for highway safety coordination, policy-making and planning. The&#13;
Leading Group will be chaired by a Vice Governor or by another representative from the&#13;
Government Office, and it will have two high-rank representatives from each of XCD and&#13;
PSB. The main functions of the Leading Group will be to monitor the accident situation&#13;
and to propose strategies and policies as well as comprehensive highway safety plans to&#13;
XAR. Such plans should include all aspects of highway safety work, also those parts that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                     ANNEX3&#13;
are outside the responsibility of XCD and PSB. The analyses of the situation should be&#13;
done on a yearly basis. Short-term action plans should also be developed on a yearly&#13;
basis and objectives and longer-term plans should equally be revised at regular intervals.&#13;
The Leading Group will be a permanent group, and its activities will go on after the&#13;
termination of the project. The Leading Group will act as a Board for the Highway&#13;
Safety Secretariat (see below). The Leading Group shall be established by the end of&#13;
1996. The first tentative policy and action plan shall be presented by the end of 1997.&#13;
5.    A Highway Safety Secretariat. It was agreed to establish a Highway Safety&#13;
Secretariat (HSS) in order to prepare the work for the Leading Group. It is suggested that&#13;
the HSS be staffed by two specially qualified persons from each of XCD and PSB.&#13;
6.    The main tasks of HSS will be to carry out analyses of the traffic accident&#13;
situation, and on the basis of such analyses it will prepare highway safety objectives,&#13;
strategies and short- and long-term highway safety plans. These objectives, strategies and&#13;
plans will be presented to the Leading Group for discussion. When adopted by the&#13;
Leading Group, they will be presented to XAR for approval. HSS will monitor the&#13;
highway safety work and situation and suggest new actions to be taken and studies to be&#13;
undertaken. HSS will also act as a resource group for the authorities. In carrying out&#13;
their duties, HSS should have the possibility to be professional assistance from the staff&#13;
in XCD and PSB when needed. In addition, HSS will act as a coordinating group for the&#13;
Highway Safety component of XHP2 during the project period.&#13;
7.    HSS shall be established by March 1997. Shortly after its creation, the four&#13;
members of HSS will be offered a four-week study tour abroad. The tour will include&#13;
meetings with key personnel from institutions in a highly motorized country. They&#13;
would meet people from Central Government and Roads Department, as well as the&#13;
services that carry out practical highway safety work. Traffic police should be visited as&#13;
well as research institutions and private organizations working with highway safety&#13;
matters.  It will focus on the elaboration of highway safety objectives and the&#13;
development of highway safety policies and plans, and also on the necessity to undertake&#13;
regular highway safety development work and research. The first regional policy on&#13;
highway safety will be developed during 1997, and the first tentative highway safety plan&#13;
will be presented to the Leading Group by the end of 1997.&#13;
Safety Audit Procedures&#13;
8.    Safety audit procedures would be developed by HSS during the project period.&#13;
The development work in Xinjiang could be inspired by the safety audit work to be&#13;
carried out under the Bank-financed projects in Zhejiang, Shaanxi and Henan.&#13;
Subsequent to the establishment of such audit procedures, these would be applied to all&#13;
major roads projects in the region.&#13;
&#13;

Black Spot Work&#13;
9.    The black spot improvement work was initiated under XHPI. The bulk of the&#13;
improvement work would, however, be covered under XHP2. The black spot work&#13;
would follow the following process: (a) identification of black spots; (b) analyses of&#13;
accident files and accident sites; (c) planning of improvements; (d) implementation; and&#13;
(e) monitoring.&#13;
10.   It was recommended that XIC would carry out the pilot black spot work as an&#13;
experiment with control site, so that it is possible to demonstrate the efficiency of the&#13;
black spot work. This could be done as follows:&#13;
(a)   XIC or TP identifies some 20 black spots.&#13;
(b)   From 20 black spots identified, 10 would be selected at random to&#13;
constitute the experiment sites, and the remaining 10 as the control sites.&#13;
(c)   Ten black spots identified as the experiment sites would be analyzed and&#13;
improved, whereas no measures would be taken at the control sites.&#13;
(d)   The effect of the black spot work would be measured through before and&#13;
after studies on accidents and road user behavior at both the experiment&#13;
sites and the control sites.&#13;
Once the pilot black spot work was completed, the regular black spot work would be&#13;
transferred to XCD to be continued on a regular basis.&#13;
Traffic Signs and Markings&#13;
11.   Due to the poor maintenance of road signs and markings in the past, the situation&#13;
is far below the acceptable standard. Recently, the responsibility for road signs and&#13;
markings was transferred from PSB to XCD. About Y 8.7 million would be allocated to&#13;
the road signs and markings component. Taking an average cost of approximately&#13;
Y 150,000 for resigning and remarking per 1 kilometer of Class II road, about 60 km of&#13;
Class II roads would be included in the proposed program.&#13;
First Aid Training&#13;
12.   The first people who arrive at the scene of an accident will be other drivers and/or&#13;
the police. The problem is, however, that none of these people have any training in first&#13;
aid techniques, and in many cases that may lead to more harm than help. It was agreed&#13;
that the first aid training be introduced into the curriculum for driver training for all&#13;
categories of drivers. It was further agreed to introduce first aid training into the&#13;
curriculum for the basic training of traffic police, as well as into the curriculum for the&#13;
courses to be organized by the new Traffic Police Training Center.&#13;

Training in Child Psychology&#13;
13.   The police are responsible for training of children at school. In Urumqi, 12 police&#13;
officers are involved in this activity, and in the whole region, about 100 officers. None of&#13;
these have, however, taken any training related to the training of children. It was agreed&#13;
that a one-week course/seminar would be offered to two groups of police officers who are&#13;
involved in this activity (one Chinese-speaking and one Uygur-speaking). The seminar&#13;
would cover child psychology and the child's capability to learn about, and to cope with&#13;
traffic at different ages. A three-week consultancy will be required, including preparation&#13;
and seminar.&#13;
Other Training Components&#13;
14.   A certain amount of training would be offered to various types of personnel from&#13;
XCD and PSB. The proposed training components are detailed in the project file.&#13;
Equipment&#13;
15.   For the implementation of the highway safety component, as well as for the safe&#13;
management of the highway, certain equipment would be procured.&#13;
Evaluation of the Highway Safety Component&#13;
16.   The objective of the highway safety component is to initiate activities that would&#13;
lead to improved highway safety in a longer perspective. It was agreed that by the end of&#13;
the project, a Chinese consultant would carry out an evaluation of the highway safety&#13;
component. His services would require 1.5 person-months. During this period, the&#13;
consultant would review the highway safety component of XHP2 as well as the road&#13;
safety component of XHPl and prepare a written report on his findings for HSS.&#13;
Costs&#13;
17.   The cost estimates for each category are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Black Spot Work. Costs for black spot improvements as well as for the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of black spot work: Y 20 million;&#13;
(b)   Traffic Signs and Markings. Costs of resigning and remarking of about&#13;
60 km of Class II highway: Y 8.7 million;&#13;
(c)   Consultancy for Child Psychology. Costs for one local expert including&#13;
travel costs: Y 12,000;&#13;
(d)   Training. The estimated cost of this component for 104 person/months:&#13;
Y 1.4 million;&#13;

ANNEX 4: TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
FOR STRATEGIC STUDY OF REGIONAL TRANSPORT&#13;
WITHIN XINJIANG PROVINCE AND BETWEEN XINJIANG&#13;
AND NEIGHBORING PROVINCES AND COUNTRIES&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Xinjiang borders eight other countries, Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan,&#13;
Tajikstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India and is the gateway of China in the west to&#13;
central Asia and eastern Europe. The total length of the foreign border is 5,391 km. It&#13;
also borders some other Chinese provinces or regions, Tibet, Qinghai and Gansu&#13;
2.    Since the founding of this autonomous region, especially since the reform and&#13;
open, transportation has seen a rapid development, forming an initial and integrated&#13;
transport system incorporating rail, air, pipeline in Xinjiang. By the end of 1994, there&#13;
were 28,600 km of road, 1,800 km of railway, 12 airports and 223,600 motor vehicles, in&#13;
which 137,200 are for freight and 86,400 for passenger and others.&#13;
3.    The vast distance between Xinjiang and the main consuming market in other&#13;
provinces of China features transport of Xinjiang while creating the most unfavorable&#13;
condition for the transport of Xinjiang.  The rail distance between Urunqi to&#13;
Lianyungang, the nearest port to Xinjiang is more than 3,760 km and to the nearest&#13;
provincial capital, Lanzhou in Gansu, is 1,900 km. The average trip length of goods&#13;
transported to and from Urumqi were 2,350 km and 3,300 km respectively. These&#13;
distances increase to 4,000 km to 5,000 km when the additional trip length within&#13;
Xinjiang is added to the distances from Urumqi. The vast transport distance greatly&#13;
increases the transport cost and hinders the development of regional economy and&#13;
exploitation of the rich reserves. Therefore, more transport links between Xinjiang and&#13;
the rest of China should be provided to increase transport capacity, reduce transport cost&#13;
and heighten transport efficiency. Moreover, efforts should be made in technical&#13;
promotion, rational modal split and optimization of transport structure and management.&#13;
4.    Xinjiang and its neighboring countries have many cultural elements in common&#13;
while their economies show considerable complimentarity. With China's priority of&#13;
economy development given to the west regions, passenger and freight transport between&#13;
Xinjiang and its neighboring countries will see a dramatic growth. At present, apart from&#13;
Beijing railroad, there are 13 direct road connections between Xinjiang and its&#13;
neighboring countries with total input and export of 4.3 million tons and 1I.1 million&#13;
passengers in 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87-                      ANNEX4&#13;
5.    Recently, the central government listed the narrowing of the gap between the East&#13;
and Central-western regions of the country as a major priority in its Ninth Five-Year Plan&#13;
(1996-2000) and a long-term  goal for the year 2010.  Priority will be given to&#13;
improvement of transport infrastructure which is considered as a fundamental way to&#13;
achieve the goal. Therefore, to carry out , e study in question is very essential and in&#13;
good time which is of far-reaching influence not only to the regional economy but also to&#13;
the national economy in the next century.&#13;
B. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PROCEDURES&#13;
6.    The objectives of the study are: to provide scientific basis for the governments&#13;
at all levels of Xinjiang in working out the medium- and long-term transport planning and&#13;
formulating transport policies and regulations. The study is to be conducted regarding&#13;
the following:&#13;
(a)   to review the present transport infrastructure and services within Xinjiang&#13;
and between Xinjiang and the rest of China and adjoining countries, to&#13;
sum up achievements and experience gained in the recent years;&#13;
(b)   to analyze the regional social economic development and predict future&#13;
transport demand; and&#13;
(c)   to recommend construction options which can satisfy the social economic&#13;
development and users' needs, to justify some comparable alternatives of&#13;
transport corridors, to recommend priorities for investment and for&#13;
transport policy and regulations favorable to transport development.&#13;
7.    In consideration of coordination of the regional medium- and long-term planning&#13;
with that of the nation and the need of having a lead study for transport facilities, this&#13;
study is projected for 15 years (1996-2010), taking the Ninth Five-Year Plan period&#13;
(1996-2000) as a key period. For some key transport projects, it can be extended to the&#13;
year 2020 when necessary.&#13;

D. STUDY METHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURES&#13;
11.   The above three parts of the work should be considered as a whole. The first two&#13;
parts will be undertaken step-by-step or concurrently, while the third, which depends on&#13;
the results of the first two, will be completed some time later.&#13;
12.   Efforts should be made to get support and assistance from SPC, MOR, and MOC,&#13;
and maximum use should be made of the existing data sources and infornation available&#13;
from all regional and national agencies who have made a great deal of work in this sector.&#13;
During the study, all new information cropped up should be considered so as to make the&#13;
study deep and expansive. All the recommendations of the study should be practical fully&#13;
considering advice of the regional government, being based on facts and experiencing&#13;
scientific justification.&#13;
13.   This study will put stress on the transport planning within Xinjiang. Assessments&#13;
of future demands for transport infrastructure should be based on minimizing the costs of&#13;
transport and providing the most efficient service to users. While working out the plan&#13;
efforts should also be made for focusing on integrated development, entire distribution&#13;
and measures so as to avoid possible limitations from a sectorial planning. The study&#13;
team should make the best use of time so as to keep working schedule and ensure study&#13;
quality.&#13;
14.   It is intended to introduce TGIS to make the qualitative analysis having scientific&#13;
basis and provide ocular study results. Data analysis and presentation of quantitative&#13;
relations will be done by means of GIS, cartogram and data bank two-dimensional&#13;
tabulations. The general function will be designed when the above-mentioned scope of&#13;
work is approved.&#13;
15.   To ensure a promising result of the study, it is intended to invite experienced&#13;
exports from the region as the senior advisors to the study.&#13;

ANNEX 5: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND ACTION&#13;
PLAN SUMMARY&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of Urumqi-Kuitun Highway (UKH) and&#13;
its linking roads were carried out by the Research Academy of Environmental Science.&#13;
An EIA report, an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and an Environmental Assessment&#13;
(EA) Summary were submitted to the Bank in April 1995 and reviewed by the Bank&#13;
during the identification mission in April 1995. Based on the comments by the Bank, the&#13;
revised EIA report, EAP and EA Summary were submitted to the Bank in June 1995 and&#13;
commented by the Bank in July 1995. Further revised EIA-related documents were&#13;
submitted to the Bank in September 1995 for final review.&#13;
2.    The process of environmental review involved inputs from various units in the&#13;
region, including environmental protection bureaus, research institutions and universities.&#13;
The affected groups and NGOs along the highways, and the people subject to&#13;
resettlement and land acquisition in particular, have been intensively consulted.&#13;
3.    The policy and administrative requirements for environmental assessment of&#13;
development projects in China were followed during preparation and evaluation of the&#13;
EIA, as well as the Bank's OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. Major laws and&#13;
regulations applied to the EIA for the Second Xinjiang Highway Project are presented&#13;
below. The major environmental standards applied in the EIA are detailed in the project&#13;

B. BRIEF PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
5.    The scope of the Second Xinjiang Highway Project is discussed in para. 3.7.&#13;
C. BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION&#13;
6.    Geology and Topography. The proposed alignment of UKH is located in the&#13;
north slope of Tianshan Mountains and on the southern fringe of Junggur Basin. Its&#13;
terrain is high in south and low in north. There is Gurbabtunggut desert to the north of&#13;
UKH. There are two major land forms along the highway-the low mountains and hilly&#13;
areas (Urabo-Diwopu) and flooding and alluvial plain in Junggar Basin (Diwopu-Kuitun).&#13;
The area that UKH traverses is in Tianshan Mountains seismic belt of Xinjiang Middle&#13;
Part Seismic Region. According to the Earthquake Intensity Map of Xinjiang in 1986&#13;
and the Earthquake Intensity Division Map of China in 1990, the basic seismic intensity&#13;
is 7 degrees in Urabo-Diwopu Section, 6 degrees in Diwopu-Jingou River, and 7 from&#13;
Jingou River to the western border of Shawan County. From the western border of&#13;
Shawan County to Kuitun, 8 degrees to the south of UKH and 7 degrees to the north.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                    ANNEX5&#13;
7.    Climate and Hydrology. The project area belongs to the continental arid climate&#13;
zone, with hot summers, long and cold winters, large temperature range in the year. The&#13;
mean annual temperatures is approximately 7°C. Extremely maximum temperature is&#13;
approximately 40°C, and extremely minimum is approximately -40°C. The mean annual&#13;
precipitation  is 160-200 mm, and maximum  daily precipitation  is 20-27 mm.&#13;
Precipitation in April through July is more than 50 percent of annual precipitation. The&#13;
prevailing wind direction is southwest and the maximum wind velocity is over 20 m/s.&#13;
The rivers traversed by UKH are 11, which belong to continental rivers. These are&#13;
seasonal rivers whose sources are glacier, melted snow and precipitation in mountain&#13;
areas. About 65 to 72 percent of annual runoff volume flows between June and August.&#13;
8.    Socioeconomic Situation. The project area is located on the economic belt of the&#13;
northern slope of Tianshan Mountains whose hub is Urumqi City. Its area includes&#13;
125,800 km  or 7.6 percent of whole Xinjiang. The total population was about 3.9&#13;
million in 1995 and population density is 31 persons/km2. The total industrial production&#13;
of the area was approximately Y 18 billion in 1993, which was 58 percent of whole&#13;
Xinjiang.&#13;
9.    Agriculture. The project area has been an important base of grain, cotton, sugar&#13;
and vegetable oil products in Xinjiang. Arable land was 5.8 million mu (390,000 ha) in&#13;
1993, about 50 percent for grain crops (mainly wheat) and 30 percent for cash crops&#13;
(mainly cotton, corn and bean). Irrigation area is about 466,000 ha, for which irrigation&#13;
channels have been well developed along UKH. Animal husbandry has also been well&#13;
developed. Natural grazing land is mainly located between the Anjihai and Kuitun&#13;
Section. Main domestic animals are sheep, goats and pigs.&#13;
10.   Ecological Setting. Main zonal vegetation is xeric shrubs and hemi-shrubs,&#13;
which constitutes drought desert pasture. Quality of pasture is medium and partly low,&#13;
and the yield is generally low. There is no natural forests along UKH. Two artificial&#13;
forests have been developed in the project area: Manasi Tree Farm (6,000 ha) and&#13;
Ganhezi Tree Farm, which are located to the north of UKH. A few trees such as Ulmus&#13;
alevis and Fraxinus sodgiana are scattered along the proposed alignment of UKH.&#13;
11.   The project belongs to Wusu and Qitai Desert Unit, which is the reclamation area&#13;
of the northern foot of Tianshan Mountains. Insecta and arthropoda are dominant in the&#13;
area. The common animal species are Bufo species of Amphibian, Eremia velox and&#13;
phrynocephalus species of Reptilia, which are widely distributed in desert belt of the&#13;
northern Xinjiang. There are no precious or endangered species along the proposed&#13;
alignment of UKH.&#13;
12.   Air Quality. Baseline air quality monitoring was carried out at nine sites in&#13;
March and July/August 1993. The air quality standards on NO, and TSP exceeded at&#13;
only one site, Xishan, which is in the boundary of the city limit. At all other sites, the&#13;
monitoring levels were well below the standards and considered fairly good.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -                    ANNEX5&#13;
13.   Noise. Baseline noise monitoring was carried out at 19 noise sensitive sites in&#13;
July 1993. The monitoring results suggest that at all sites the noise level (Leq) in both&#13;
daytime and at night is below the noise standards, which are adopted as assessment&#13;
criteria, and at most sites the noise level is fairly low, less than 50 dB(A) in daytime and&#13;
40 dB(A) at night. The major noise source is traffic.&#13;
D. POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THEIR MITIGATION MEASURES&#13;
14.   Major potential impacts and their mitigation measures regarding UKH and its&#13;
linking roads are summarized below and incorporated in the Environmental Action Plan&#13;
(EAP) of UKH and its linking roads. The EAP stipulates how the environmental impacts&#13;
identified in the EIA will be dealt with in the design, construction and operation phases,&#13;
and what institutional arrangements have been made for the implementation of the EAP&#13;
during the three distinct phases. The key elements of the EAP are summarized as&#13;
Appendix I of this Annex.&#13;
Design Phase&#13;
15.   Alternative Alignments. Two alternatives were considered in each of Urumqi&#13;
Transit Section, Xishan-Wugontai Section and Shihezi Section. For Urumqi Transit&#13;
Section, a new transit road starting from Urabo, and upgrading of the existing road were&#13;
considered. Consequently, the new road was selected because of less disturbance of city&#13;
traffic and has less resettlement and environmental pollution in the city. For Xishan-&#13;
Wugontai Section, northern and southern alternatives were considered and the southern&#13;
route was adopted because of less resettlement, less environmentally sensitive areas and&#13;
better geological conditions. For Shihezi Section, southern and northern routes were&#13;
considered and the southern route was selected because of much less farmland&#13;
occupation, less resettlement, less dust and noise impacts in Shihezi City, and better&#13;
geological conditions.&#13;
16.   Social Disruption. In order to minimize problems of community separation and&#13;
isolation due to the project construction, 32 grade separations and 166 underpasses would&#13;
be provided.&#13;
17.   Soil Erosion. Soil erosion will mainly take place in low mountains and hilly&#13;
areas. High embankment slopes will be stabilized with turf. Planting of trees and grass&#13;
in the median divider and along the roadside was included in the design where&#13;
appropriate. Temporary and permanent drainage systems were designed to minimize soil&#13;
erosion and alteration of hydrological regimes.&#13;
18.   Transmigration of Livestock. Based on field surveys, the Anjihai-Kuitun&#13;
Section (54 km) was identified to be a main area where transmigration of livestock&#13;
frequently happens in spring and autumn. For this section, 3 medium bridges, 14 small&#13;
bridges and 32 underpasses with sufficient height and width for livestock were designed&#13;
to avoid impacts on their transmigration. In addition, some culverts will also be used for&#13;
transmigration of livestock.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -                      ANNEX5&#13;
19.   Noise. Most of the villages within 200 m from the roadsides are small and&#13;
sparsely populated. Altogether 19 environmentally sensitive sites were identified for&#13;
special attention. According to the traffic noise prediction during the operation phase&#13;
(2000, 2010 and 2020), the noise level at 12 sites will significantly exceed the assessment&#13;
criteria. To avoid such noise problems, the following measures have been identified and&#13;
integrated into the designs, considering predicted noise levels and local situations.&#13;
(a)   By 2000, resettlement of residences to avoid significant noise problems&#13;
(Changfeng Sidui, Yuanhucum Shang);&#13;
(b)   By 2010, approximately 5,860 m of heightened fences besides residences&#13;
and schools (5 sites), and resettlement at one site; and&#13;
(c)   By 2020, 300 m of noise barrier (142 Brickyard), additional 765 m of&#13;
heightened fences besides residences and schools (3 sites), and&#13;
resettlement at 2 sites.&#13;
(d)   The construction of new residential buildings will be prohibited within&#13;
200 m from the roadsides. The residences within 200 m from the roadside&#13;
will be gradually relocated.&#13;
20.   Air Pollution. NOX, CO and hydrocarbons (HC) concentrations in 2000, 2010&#13;
and 2020 were predicted along the proposed alignment and environmentally sensitive&#13;
sites. While CO and HC concentrations will be below the standards in all predicted&#13;
years, NO. concentrations besides the road will exceed the standards. Daily average NO.&#13;
concentrations will exceed the standard at one section in 2000, 10 sections in 2010 and 14&#13;
sections in 2020. The probability to exceed the standard is, however, only 9 percent&#13;
throughout a year. Maximum NOx concentrations will exceed the standard in 5 sections&#13;
in 2000, 14 sections in 2010, and 17 sections in 2020. However, NOX concentrations will&#13;
exceed the standards at no environmentally sensitive sites in 2000 and 2010, and at only 2&#13;
sites (Sanpin Liudui and Yuanhucun) in 2020. To avoid air pollution problems, the&#13;
following measures will be taken:&#13;
(a)   Tree planting will be undertaken, to mitigate air pollution particularly dust&#13;
and NOx.&#13;
(b)   Vehicle emission inspection will be strengthened.  XCD  will also&#13;
undertake random vehicle emission inspection at three toll stations&#13;
(Urumqi, Shihezi and Kuitun) not to allow the vehicles exceeding the&#13;
emission standards traveling on the Expressway.&#13;
(c)   Air quality monitoring will be carried out during the operation phase to&#13;
detect any significant air pollution problems and to take necessary&#13;
measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
(d)   Besides the above effort by XCD and other relevant authorities in&#13;
Xinjiang, it is expected that the vehicle emission standards will be&#13;
strengthened and more stringent emission standards will be applied to new&#13;
vehicles in the future, which is not taken into account in the EIA.&#13;
21.   Water Pollution. Impacts on surface water are mainly anticipated in Toutonghe-&#13;
Shihezi Section and Shihezi-Anjihai Section.  Adequate permanent and temporary&#13;
drainage systems were incorporated in the designs to minimize surface water pollution&#13;
and disturbance to irrigation channels and existing drainage systems.  Wastewater&#13;
treatment facilities were included in the design of service areas in order to prevent direct&#13;
discharge of waste water to public water bodies.&#13;
22.   Cultural Relics. An archaeological field survey was carried out in March/April&#13;
1995 by Xinjiang Cultural Relics and Archeological Institute. The survey revealed that&#13;
most remains are located more than 1,000 m away from the proposed alignment of UKH.&#13;
Only an unclassified archaeological site at Cangfanggou in Dawan Xiang (K7 + 750:&#13;
between Urabo and Xishan Sections) may be affected by construction activities.&#13;
Excavation of the site, therefore, was conducted and it was found that no cultural remains&#13;
exist underground within the working area of construction activities.&#13;
23.   Flooding. All bridges, culverts and roadside drainage systems were adequately&#13;
designed to meet requirements for safe discharge of floods (300-year design floods for&#13;
super-large bridges and 1 00-year floods design for other bridges and culverts).&#13;
24.   Landscape. Afforestation will be undertaken to improve landscape at median&#13;
dividers, slopes and ditches as well as beyond the right-of-way. Also landscaping and&#13;
other aesthetic effects were considered during the design of bridges, service areas and&#13;
interchanges.&#13;
Construction Phase&#13;
25.   Fugitive Dust and Other Air Pollution. Quarries, material borrow sites, waste&#13;
disposal sites and transportation routes to construction sites were identified as the major&#13;
areas that create dust and other air pollution. Road surfaces, excavation areas and&#13;
construction sites will be sprayed with water and kept moist particularly near towns and&#13;
other sensitive locations. Access roads will be upgraded, widened and paved where&#13;
necessary, and sprayed regularly to minimize fugitive dust. Stockpiles and storage areas&#13;
will be either covered or sprayed. Construction materials will be covered during hauling&#13;
to prevent undue dust or debris on roads. Asphalt and lime stone mixing equipment will&#13;
be equipped with dust collectors and will be located at least 500 m from residential areas&#13;
on the leeside of the wind directions.&#13;
26.   Noise. Construction machinery and trucks will be equipped with proper noise&#13;
control devices and will be properly operated and maintained. Construction activities&#13;
will be suspended between 11:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. within 200 m from residential areas.&#13;
Transportation of construction materials will be undertaken with careful consideration to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -                       ANNEX5&#13;
minimizing noise impacts on residents along the roadside.  Traffic management,&#13;
including dissemination of traffic rules and setting up of speed limits will be&#13;
strengthened.&#13;
27.   Protection of Land Resources. Forests will not be used for material borrow&#13;
sites. Arable land will be avoided as material borrow sites where possible. If excavation&#13;
has to be done in arable land, top soil layer will be saved and returned after construction&#13;
works is completed to minimize impacts on ecosystems and agriculture. Education of&#13;
construction workers will be strengthened to protect natural resources, wild plants and&#13;
animals.&#13;
28.   Soil Erosion and Water Pollution.  Trees and grass will be planted on side&#13;
slopes, and along the roadside, where appropriate.  Appropriate measures, either&#13;
rehabilitation or reconstruction, will be taken if the existing irrigation or drainage systems&#13;
are damaged. All necessary measures will be taken to prevent earth and stones from&#13;
silting up rivers, water channels or existing irrigation and drainage systems. Temporary&#13;
channel or conduit will be constructed for irrigation and drainage, during the construction&#13;
of permanent drainage systems. All reasonable measures will be taken to prevent direct&#13;
discharge of polluted water from construction activities into rivers and irrigation&#13;
channels.&#13;
29.   Construction Camps. Septic tanks will be installed at construction camp sites to&#13;
prevent direct discharge of sanitary sewage to public water bodies. Sludge in sewer&#13;
treatment pits will be disposed of regularly. Garbage will be collected in garbage cans at&#13;
fixed locations and disposed of regularly. Drinking water at construction sites will meet&#13;
China's national drinking water standards.&#13;
30.   Cultural Relics. Construction works will be stopped immediately if any cultural&#13;
relics are discovered as a result of road construction or excavation activities. The local&#13;
cultural relics authorities will be informed and a field survey of the site will be&#13;
undertaken. Excavation will not be resumed until authorized institutions identify the&#13;
importance and necessary preservation measures.&#13;
31.   Traffic Management. Adequate traffic control measures, including installation&#13;
of traffic signals, will be implemented particularly in interchange sections and main&#13;
control points to prevent or minimize traffic jams during the construction period. A&#13;
construction material transportation plan will be developed to avoid hauling activities&#13;
during peak hours especially on existing roads.&#13;
32.   Construction Safety. In order to guarantee construction safety, efficient lighting&#13;
equipment and safety signs will be installed on temporary roads during the construction,&#13;
and adequate traffic regulations will be adopted and implemented for temporary roads.&#13;
During construction, the contractors will adopt effective safety and warning measures to&#13;
avoid accidents, stipulate blasting time, signals and guarding line, and carefully check&#13;
before blasting. Management and use of blasting materials will strictly follow safety&#13;
requirements of the Public Safety Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
Operation Phase&#13;
33.   Noise and Air Pollution. Unnecessary use of horns will be strictly restricted at&#13;
night. Noise barriers or other appropriate noise protection measures will be taken at&#13;
locations where noise exceeds standards significantly, based on the monitoring results.&#13;
34.   Vehicle Management.  Better vehicle maintenance and management will be&#13;
enhanced to keep vehicles in good conditions. Vehicle noise and emission inspection&#13;
will be strengthened and vehicles which do not meet noise and exhaust emission&#13;
standards will not be allowed to use UKH and other roads in the region. Random vehicle&#13;
emission inspections will be undertaken at the Urumqi, Shihezi and Kuitun toll stations.&#13;
Public awareness campaigns and education will be undertaken to farniliarize people with&#13;
air and noise pollution regulations. In order to avoid future noise and air pollution&#13;
problems, development of residential areas and construction of sensitive buildings such&#13;
as schools and hospitals will be prohibited within 200 m from the roadside.&#13;
35.   Risk of Hazardous Material Spill. Any vehicle transporting hazardous materials&#13;
will inform the Public Security Bureau (PSB) prior to the transportation. PSB stipulates&#13;
time and route of driving vehicles and parking places. The vehicle needs to have&#13;
dangerous signs and the driver needs to be well experienced. Both of them will be&#13;
inspected. Passengers cannot ride the vehicle transporting hazardous materials. Signs&#13;
will be set up at environmentally sensitive sites to alert the drivers for traffic safety.&#13;
Traffic peak hours will be avoided for transportation of hazardous materials.&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING&#13;
36.   During the construction and operation of UKH  and its linking roads,&#13;
environmental monitoring will be carried out to verify the actual impacts on the&#13;
environment, identify unexpected environmental problems at an early stage, and adjust&#13;
environmental protection measures as appropriate.  The Xinjiang Environmental&#13;
Monitoring Center will mainly carry out necessary environmental monitoring during the&#13;
construction and operation phases. However, noise and dust will be monitored by the&#13;
environmental supervisors at each of the construction contract sections. An annual&#13;
monitoring report would be furnished to the Bank during the construction phase and for&#13;
each of the first three years following completion of construction.&#13;
37.   The major items to be monitored during the construction phase will include air&#13;
quality, noise, lead in soil, crops and herbage and transmigration of livestock. In addition&#13;
to the above items, vehicle exhaust will be inspected during the operation phase. Water&#13;
quality will not be monitored because the rivers in the project area are seasonal, and the&#13;
construction activities besides the rivers will be carried out in dry seasons, and therefore&#13;
will not have impacts on river water quality. The detailed monitoring plan is presented&#13;
below.&#13;
38.   Air Quality.  Items to be monitored will include dust (by environmental&#13;
supervisors) and total suspended particulates (TSP) during the construction phase and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
nitrogen oxides (NOJ), CO, TSP and hydrocarbons (HC) during the operation phase.&#13;
During the construction phase, TSP will be monitored four times a year for five&#13;
consecutive days each time and fugitive dust every 10 days. Monitoring sites will be&#13;
construction sites, quarries and material borrow sites, and major roads used for hauling&#13;
construction materials. During the operation phase, NO,, CO, TSP and HC will be&#13;
monitored three times a year, each time for three consecutive days and four times a day at&#13;
five monitoring sites along UKH (Urumqi, Wugongtai, Shihezi, Shawan and Kuitun).&#13;
39.   Noise. During the construction phase, noise monitoring will be carried out by&#13;
environmental supervisors in each contract section in daytime and at night on a weekly&#13;
basis at construction sites, quarries, material borrow sites and major construction&#13;
materials hauling roads. Ad hoc monitoring will also be undertaken. During the&#13;
operation phase, noise monitoring will be carried out four times a year, in daytime and at&#13;
night at five sites along UKH. Ad hoc monitoring will also be undertaken.&#13;
40.   Lead in Soil, Crops and Herbage. Sampling and analysis will be conducted at&#13;
sites 0 m, 50 m, 100 m and 200 m away from the roadsides in Urumqi, Shihezi and&#13;
Kuitun once in two years during the construction and operation phases.  Baseline&#13;
monitoring will also be carried out before construction works start.&#13;
41.   Transmigration of Livestock. The environmental expert being familiar with&#13;
animal husbandry will make observation twice a year to check whether transmigration of&#13;
livestock is affected by the project in the Anjihai-Kuitun Section.&#13;
42.   Vehicle Exhaust and Noise Inspection. Vehicle exhaust gasses (CO and HC in&#13;
gasoline-powered vehicles, and smoke density in diesel-powered vehicles) will be&#13;
randomly inspected at Urumqi, Shihezi and Kuitun toll stations during the operation&#13;
phase.&#13;
F. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
43.   The following institutional arrangements for environmental protection will be&#13;
undertaken for UKH:&#13;

A. Design Phase&#13;
1. Route Selection         The alignment was selected from a few alternatives In serveral sections,  XCD/FHSDI&#13;
with due consideration to minimize land acquisition, impacts of air&#13;
pollution and noise on residential areas, and to avoid unfavorable&#13;
geological conditions and archaeological sites.&#13;
2. Social Disruption       32 grade grade separations and 166 underpasses were designed to meet    XCD/FHSDI&#13;
the requirements for crossing of local people, animals and vehicles. In&#13;
particular, 3 medium and 14 small bridges, 32 passageways were&#13;
designed in Anjihai-Kuitun Section (54 km) for transmigration of&#13;
livestock.&#13;
3. Soil Erosion            Planting of trees and grass on median divider, sideslopes, and along the  XCD/FHSDI&#13;
roadside, was included in the design where appropriate.&#13;
Temporary and permanent drainage systems were designed to minimize      XCD/FHSDI&#13;
soil erosion and alteration of hydrological regimes, including impacts on&#13;
irrigation channels.&#13;
4. Water Pollution         Waste water treatment facilities were designed for service areas.       XCDIFHSDI&#13;
5. Noise                   Adequate measures such as resettlement, noise barriers, fences were&#13;
identified and integrated in the design and bid documents.&#13;
6. Flooding                Bridges and culverts were adequately sized to meet requirements for     XCD/FHSDI&#13;
safe discharge of design flood (300 years for super-large bridges, 100&#13;
years for other bridges and culverts).&#13;
7. Cultural Relics         Cultural relics survey including field excavation was carried out and no  XCD/FHSDI&#13;
important cultural relics were found in the working area of the project.&#13;
8. Afforestatlon           Afrorestation plan was developed to reduce sir pollution problems and   XCD/FHSDI&#13;
enhance better landscape.&#13;
3. Construction Phase&#13;
1. Protection of Land      Forests will not be used for material borrow sites. Reforestation will be  Contractors&#13;
Resources              undertaken upon completion of construction activities.&#13;
Arable land will be avoided as material borrow sites wherever possible.&#13;
If excavation has to be done in arable land, top soil layer will be saved&#13;
and returned after construction work is completed, so as to minimize&#13;
impacts on ecosystem and agriculture.&#13;
Education of construction workers will be strengthened to protect&#13;
natural resources, wild plants and animals. Poaching will be strictly&#13;
prohibited.&#13;
2. Soil Erosion/Water      Trees and grasses will be planted on side slope, and along the roadside,  Contractors&#13;
Pollution              where appropriate. Appropriate measures, either rehabilitation or&#13;
reconstruction, will be taken, if the existing irrigation or drainage systems&#13;
are damaged.&#13;
All necessary measures will be taken to prevent earth &amp; stones from&#13;
silting up rivers, water channels, or existing irrigation and drainage&#13;
systems.&#13;
Temporary channel or conduit will be constructed for irrigation and&#13;
drainage, during the construction of permanent drainage systems.&#13;
All reasonable messurers will be taken to prevent direct discharge of&#13;
polluted water from construction activities into rivers and irrigation&#13;
chsnnels.&#13;
&#13;

3. Construction Camps      Septic tanks will be installed at the construction camp sites. Sludge in  Contractors&#13;
sewage treatment pits will be disposed of regularly. Drinking water will&#13;
meet the Chinese national drinking water standards.&#13;
Garbage will be collected In garbage cans at fixed locations and disposed&#13;
of regularly.&#13;
4. Dust/Air Pollution      All reasonable steps, includeuding watering, will be taken to minimize    Contractors&#13;
dust pollution during construction, particularly in places near towns.&#13;
Stockpiles and storage areas will be located far away from residential&#13;
areas on the lee side of the wind direction. Stockpiles and storage areas&#13;
will be covered or watered to prevent dust pollution. Trucks to transport&#13;
construction materials will be covered to minimize spills.&#13;
Asphalt and lime stone mixing sites will be located at least 500 m from&#13;
residential areas on the lee side of the wind direction. Asphalt plants will&#13;
be equipped with adequate dust collectors.&#13;
5. Transportation          Hauling route of construction materials will be selected in a careful     Contractors&#13;
Management              manner to minimize interference with existing communications facilities,&#13;
and dust and noise. Construction materials hauling plans will be&#13;
developed to avoid hauling activities during the peak traffic hours.&#13;
Adequate actions to direct traMic will be taken in consultation with&#13;
relevant authorities, to prevent or minimize traffic jams during the&#13;
construction period.&#13;
In the sections where existing roads are occupied, temporary roads will be&#13;
constructed before existing roads are occupied for construction of new&#13;
highway.&#13;
6. Noise                   Reasonable schedule of construction activities will be developed to avoid  Contractors&#13;
noisy construction activities during the night time (23:00 - 9:00),&#13;
particularly in such sites within 200 m from residential areas.&#13;
Maintenance of machines and trucks will be improved to minimize noise.&#13;
7. Cultural Relics         Excavation will be stopped immediately if any cultural relics are found,  Contractors&#13;
and the local cultural authority will be informed of such discovery.&#13;
Excavation will not be resumed until identification of cultural relics by the&#13;
authorized institution is completed and necessary preservation measures&#13;
identified.&#13;
8. Construction Safety     In order to guarantee safety, efcient lighting equipment and safety signs  Contractors&#13;
will be installed on temporary roads during the construction, and&#13;
adequate traffic regulations will be adopted and implemented for&#13;
temporary roads. Effective safety and warning measures will be taken to&#13;
avoid accidents. Blasting time, signals and guarding lines will be&#13;
adequately set and careful check will be carried out before blasting.&#13;
Management and use of blasting materials will strictly follow safety&#13;
requirements.&#13;
C. Operation Phase&#13;
1. Noise and Air           Unnecessary use of horns will be strictly restricted at night             XHGHAB&#13;

Noise barriers or other appropriate noise protection measures will be     XHGHAB&#13;
taken at locations where noise exceeds standard, based on the results of&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
2. Vehicle Management    Better vehicle maintenance/management will be enhanced to keep vehicles      XHGHAB&#13;
in good conditions. Vehicle noise and emissions inspection will be&#13;
strengthened. If a vehicle does not comply with the noise and/or emissions&#13;
standards, the vehicle will not pass inspection on roads till the problem is&#13;
rectified. Periodical and random exhaust gas emissions inspection will be&#13;
undertaken at Urumqi, Shihezi and Kuitun toll stations.&#13;
Public awareness and education will be promoted to familiarize people  XEPB/XHGHAB&#13;
with the problems of air pollution and noise from vehicles and with&#13;
related regulations.&#13;
3. Hazardous Materials    Anybody transporting hazardous materials will inform the Public           PSB/XHGHAB&#13;
Spills                  Security Bureau (PSB) prior to the transportation. PSB stipulates time,&#13;
route and parking places of driving vehicles. Both vehicles and drivers&#13;
will be inspected by PSD. Vehicles will have danger signs. Signs will be&#13;
set up at environmentally sensitive sites to alert drivers for traffic safety.&#13;
Traffic peak hours will be avoided for transportation of hazardous&#13;
materials. Contingency plans will be established to deal with accidents.&#13;

ANNEX 6: LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
1.    This Annex describes the land acquisition and resettlement impacts associated&#13;
with the Second Xinjiang Highways Project (XHP2) and the measures taken by XCD to&#13;
address these impacts, as described in the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the&#13;
project.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
2.    XHP2 includes the following civil works components:&#13;
(a)   The 267 km Urumqi-Kuitun Highway (UKH)&#13;
(b)   Interchanges along the UKH&#13;
(c)   The four linking roads interconnecting UKH with cities/towns along the&#13;
existing highway.&#13;
3.    The construction of the UKH, interchanges and linking roads will require land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation of affected persons. In order to mitigate&#13;
the adverse impacts due to land acquisition and resettlement, XCD had prepared a&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The RAP describes the following aspects of land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement planning and implementation:&#13;
(a)   the scope and extent of project impacts;&#13;
(b)   the legal framework and resettlement policies to compensate and resettle/&#13;
rehabilitate the affected persons;&#13;
(c)   the institutional arrangements for preparation, implementation and&#13;
monitoring of the RAP;&#13;
(d)   costs and budget for RAP implementation;&#13;
(e)   Implementation steps and schedule;&#13;
(f)   Participation of affected persons in the resettlement program;&#13;
(g)   Mechanisms for redress of grievances;&#13;
(h)   Monitoring of RAP implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106-                      ANNEX6&#13;
Project Impacts&#13;
4.    The land acquisition and resettlement impacts of the project were surveyed by the&#13;
First Highway Survey and Design Institute (FHSDI), with the involvement of local&#13;
governments and the affected people along the proposed route. About 17,088 mu&#13;
(1,139.26 ha) of land will need to be acquired permanently. About 6,998 mu (466.54 ha)&#13;
will be leased temporarily during the construction period for encampment, approach&#13;
roads and quarries. Permanent land acquisition will affect 3,706 persons. To minimize&#13;
the land acquisition resettlement impacts of land-leasing, it will be restricted to&#13;
wastelands to the extent possible. About 265 families (1,106 persons) will be affected&#13;
due to house relocation. Nine enterprises employing 243 workers will also be relocated.&#13;
5.   In order to establish a baseline of the socioeconomic conditions of the affected&#13;
persons, a detailed socioeconomic survey was carried out by the Xinjiang Academy of&#13;
Social Sciences (XASS), and was completed by August 31, 1996.&#13;
Legal Framework and Resettlement Policies&#13;
6.    The following laws, regulations and guidelines form the basis for preparation of&#13;
the RAP.&#13;
(a)   Land Management Law of China;&#13;
(b)   Guidelines for enforcement of The Land Management Law of China in the&#13;
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region;&#13;
(c)   Regulations for Compensation and Resettlement for State Construction&#13;
Land Acquisition in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the&#13;
attached tables (specifying the compensation rates);&#13;
(d)   Rules to enforce "the Management Regulation of House Removal in&#13;
Cities";&#13;
(e)   Preferential policy of Land Acquisition and Resettlement of Urumqi-&#13;
Kuitun Highway Construction.&#13;
Implementation of the resettlement program will be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of the RAP.&#13;
7.    The main objective of the resettlement program is to ensure that all affected&#13;
persons are able to improve or at least restore their existing standards of living. This&#13;
object will be attained by following established principles of resettlement in China and&#13;
delivering specific entitlements of the persons affected by land acquisition's resettlement.&#13;
The resettlement principles aim to avoid or minimize resettlement; restore or improve the&#13;
standards of living of the adversely affected people; consult affected localities during&#13;
project design, compensate villages for the land acquired from them and to compensate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107 -                       ANNEX6&#13;
project design, compensate villages for the land acquired from them and to compensate&#13;
individuals for houses, standing crops, or other individually held assets; provide land to&#13;
affected persons through land redistribution; and to entrust the implementation of&#13;
resettlement programs to the local governments. These principles substantially meet the&#13;
Bank's requirements on resettlement.  Based on national laws and regulations on&#13;
resettlement, Xinjiang Autonomous Region will issue land acquisition, compensation and&#13;
resettlement guidelines for XHP2.&#13;
Compensation and Resettlement Policies&#13;
8.    The various types of impacts and the compensation or resettlement strategies and&#13;
policies for each category of impact are given below:&#13;
(a)   Farmland Acquisition. Persons affected by land acquisition will be&#13;
provided with alternative agricultural land by bringing additional land&#13;
under cultivation or by redistributing the total land available in the&#13;
villages/production teams. The minimum per capita landholding which&#13;
must be maintained in all the villages is 1.5 mu (1,000 m).  If the&#13;
landholding in any production team or village falls below this level, the&#13;
affected persons are entitled to be provided jobs in enterprises. However,&#13;
in this project, there is no case where the per capita landholding falls&#13;
below this minimum level and therefore, all affected persons will be&#13;
rehabilitated through provision of altemative land. Affected farmland will&#13;
be compensated at six times the average annual productivity of the land.&#13;
Standing crops will be compensated at their market value.&#13;
(b)   Temporary land leasing. Efforts will be made to lease only wasteland so&#13;
that there are no adverse land acquisition impacts.   Land leased&#13;
temporarily will be compensated at its actual productive value for the&#13;
duration of the lease. Compensation will include: (i) crop compensation;&#13;
(ii) land compensation; (iii) cost of restoration of the land to its original&#13;
condition after project completion. No buildings will need to be relocated&#13;
due to temporary leasing.&#13;
(c)    Affected houses. Compensation for affected houses and buildings, owned&#13;
by enterprises or individuals, will be paid at replacement rates, as&#13;
described in the RAP. No deduction will be made for depreciation or the&#13;
cost of salvageable materials while calculating the total compensation&#13;
payable.&#13;
(d)   Affected enterprises. The affected enterprises will be relocated close to&#13;
their existing locations on land provided by the villages. Affected assets&#13;
will be compensated at replacement rates. Workers will be employed in&#13;
the same reconstructed enterprises and will be paid a work stoppage&#13;
allowance equivalent to their wages for the duration of work stoppage.&#13;
The affected enterprises will be provided a production stoppage allowance,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108-                      ANNEX6&#13;
for the duration of work stoppage based on the average net profit in the&#13;
previous six months.&#13;
(e)   Infrastructure and other assets. Compensation for infrastructure and&#13;
other affected assets will be paid at replacement cost to the affected&#13;
individuals, collectives or governments, depending on the ownership of&#13;
these assets.&#13;
(f)    Moving and Transition allowance. Each affected household will be paid&#13;
a moving allowance and a transition allowance for a period of four&#13;
months.&#13;
(g)   Payment of Compensation. Compensation for standing crops, houses&#13;
and other private structures will be paid directly to the affected persons.&#13;
All allowances will also be paid to the affected persons. Compensation for&#13;
affected land, public infrastructure, and the resettlement subsidy will be&#13;
paid to the county government.&#13;
Institutional Responsibility&#13;
9.   In the PEO, a Resettlement and Monitoring Office (RMO) has been formed to&#13;
carry out the coordination of the planning, implementation and monitoring of land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement activities under the project. The actual implementation will&#13;
be carried out by the local county and township governments in accordance with the&#13;
agreements signed with XCD (PEO), based on the provisions of the RAP. A Lead Group&#13;
on resettlement has already been formed for XHP1 (TUDH) and the same group will be&#13;
responsible for overseeing the implementation of the RAP for XHP2 (UKH).&#13;
10.   The FHSDI is responsible for conducting further detailed surveys based on&#13;
detailed engineering designs. Monitoring and Evaluation of RAP implementation will be&#13;
carried out by XASS who will also be responsible for conducting baseline and follow up&#13;
socioeconomic surveys of the affected people.&#13;
11.   Resettlement staff from RMO, the local communications bureau and the other&#13;
bureaus in the local government will be given training on resettlement implementation&#13;
and monitoring as a part of the project.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
12.   The RAP will be implemented from April 1996 to February 1997, in accordance&#13;
with the detailed implementation schedule incorporated into the RAP. The resettlement&#13;
implementation schedule and the project construction schedule will be linked in order to&#13;
ensure that the implementation of land acquisition and resettlement activities is&#13;
completed at least one month before the start of project construction. The RAP&#13;
implementation schedule is detailed in the project file.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
Costs and Budgets&#13;
13.   The cost of land acquisition and resettlement is included as a part of the overall&#13;
project budget. The annual requirement of funds for RAP implementation will be&#13;
included in the annual investment plans. An item-wise cost table of all land acquisition&#13;
and resettlement activities is shown in the project file as well. The cost estimates include&#13;
a contingency allowance at 6 percent of the total LAR budget has been provided for.&#13;
Similarly, a 5 percent allowance is made for inflation during project implementation.&#13;
Compensation amounts payable to the affected persons will be adjusted every year by the&#13;
annual inflation factor. However, since compensation payment is expected to take place&#13;
within one year, inflation is not expected to be significant. An amount of 4 percent of the&#13;
total budget will be paid to the land management bureaus at various levels as&#13;
management fee for implementing the RAP.&#13;
Redress of Grievances&#13;
14.   In case any affected person is dissatisfied with any aspect of the resettlement&#13;
program, their grievance can be lodged with the local land management bureau at the&#13;
township or the county level. In case the issue is not resolved satisfactorily within three&#13;
weeks, a formal application can be made to the Lead Group on resettlement. The issue&#13;
will be resolved by the Lead Group within four weeks. If the affected person is not&#13;
satisfied with the decision of the Lead Group, he or she can lodge a written appeal to the&#13;
county level peoples court. If the decision of the county level court does not satisfy the&#13;
affected person, a second appeal can be lodged in the court of the city/prefecture. The&#13;
decision of this court will be final and binding.&#13;
Information Dissemination, Participation and Consultations&#13;
15.   The affected persons will be informed through various media about the project&#13;
and the expected land acquisition and resettlement program. The LAR institutions will&#13;
also disseminate information through meetings, and notices about the proposed&#13;
compensation rates and compensation strategies. The affected people will participate in&#13;
(a) efforts to minimize land acquisition and resettlement through choice of appropriate&#13;
alignment alternatives; (b) survey of affected persons; (c) selection of new residential&#13;
sites; (d) construction of new houses; and (e) monitoring and evaluation of resettlement&#13;
activities.&#13;
16.   In order to facilitate complete understanding of the resettlement program and of&#13;
their entitlements, a Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB) will be distributed to&#13;
affected people and their representatives within two months of completion of project&#13;
negotiations. The RIB will contain: (a) a brief description of the project and its land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement impacts; (b) brief review of the land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement program; (c) detailed entitlement policies for the various categories of&#13;
affected people; (d) institutions responsible for delivery of entitlements; (e) grievance&#13;
redresses mechanism; and (f) arrangements for monitoring and evaluation of the&#13;
resettlement program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-110-                      ANNEX6&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
17.   The implementation of the RAPs will be carried out both internally (by RMO and&#13;
the local communications bureau) and externally (by XASS, specially engaged by XCD&#13;
for this purpose).&#13;
(a)   Internal Monitoring. Internal monitoring will be monitored by the staff&#13;
from RMO and those from the local (city/county, and township)&#13;
communications bureaus. Detailed formats for internal monitoring have&#13;
been prepared and attached as annexes to the RAP. Internal monitoring&#13;
will ensure that: (i) compensation is paid as per the established standards&#13;
in the RAP; (ii) land redistribution is carried out in a timely manner and to&#13;
the full satisfaction of the affected people; (iii) employees of affected&#13;
enterprises are reabsorbed in the same enterprises after relocation;&#13;
(iv) adequate compensation has been paid to the persons without residence&#13;
registration certificates or those who have built their houses illegally; and&#13;
(v) the information dissemination and grievance redress process is&#13;
implemented efficiently. Data regarding affected households will be&#13;
collected and stored for subsequent comparisons. The internal monitoring&#13;
reports will be prepared every three months and summary of internal&#13;
reporting will be submitted to the Bank every six months. Internal&#13;
monitoring will concentrate on the physical progress of RAP&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(b)   External Monitoring. External monitoring will be carried out by XASS&#13;
and reports will be submitted every six months, until one year after the&#13;
completion of RAP implementation. External monitoring will verify the&#13;
results of internal monitoring and focus on qualitative issues in RAP&#13;
implementation. XASS will select random, representative samples of&#13;
affected persons from all categories (at least 25 percent), hold discussions&#13;
in the affected areas or resettlement sites, collect secondary information&#13;
from project agencies and the internal monitoring agencies as inputs for&#13;
preparation of their reports. External monitoring should identify problems&#13;
in the implementation process and make recommendations to address&#13;
these problems. The first report of the external monitoring agency should&#13;
be received by the Bank by December 31, 1996. External monitoring will&#13;
continue until one year after completion of RAP implementation. The&#13;
need to carry out further monitoring, if necessary, will be reviewed at that&#13;
stage. A follow-up socioeconomic survey will be carried out by XASS to&#13;
determine the impact of the project on the standards of living of the&#13;
affected people. This survey will be carried out one year after the&#13;
completion of the project.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 9: PROPOSED MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
A. PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
1.    The effectiveness of project implementation in terms of alleviating infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks of Xinjiang at which the project is targeted, will be measured by reference to&#13;
a number of monitoring indicators. The specific project objectives and the associated&#13;
monitoring indicators are listed in Table 1. Each indicator requires a baseline level&#13;
against which the effectiveness of the project in achieving the design objectives can be&#13;
measured. XCD obtained the necessary baseline data (as of July 1996) and developed the&#13;
necessary methodologies for monitoring. The parameters, baseline and targeted values&#13;
shown in the table were set out during the appraisal and were finalized during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
2.    The achievement of project output will be monitored by monitoring indicators.&#13;
The current monitorable targets are set as shown in Table 2.&#13;
B. MONITORING INDICATORS FOR ENVIRONMENT&#13;
Construction Period&#13;
3.    Environmental Supervision: One of the environmental supervisors in each&#13;
contract section will be assigned or nominated to carry out the supervision of the&#13;
environmental protection measures addressed in the Environmental Action Plans (EAP)&#13;
and integrated in the bid documents. The results will be included in the engineering&#13;
supervision reports and reported periodically to the environmental protection staff at the&#13;
district level. The results of environmental supervision will be annually reported to the&#13;
Bank in the annual report. The monitoring items will include:&#13;
(a)   brief description on environmuental protection measures supervised/&#13;
inspected during the reporting period; and&#13;
(b)   brief description of problems regarding environmental protection measures&#13;
and their reasons and possible solutions.&#13;
4.    Environmental Monitoring:   Environmental monitoring items, methods,&#13;
frequencies, monitoring sites have been clearly decided in the EAP (see Annex 4).&#13;
Environmental monitoring will be carried out by the Xinjiang Environmental Monitoring&#13;
Center except noise and dust, which will be conducted by environmental supervisors at&#13;
respective contract sections. The results will be reported to the environmental protection&#13;
staff at the district level. The results of environmental monitoring will also be annually&#13;
reported to the Bank in the annual report.&#13;
