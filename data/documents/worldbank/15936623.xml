&#13;
     The next item of business are three proposed loans to&#13;
Japan.   I would like to oall on the following _Ilbers of the&#13;
statt -- first Mr. Dorr and then Mr. Rabert.     Mr. Dorr&#13;
will give the general presentation and Mr. Rembert will discus&#13;
the teCbn1cal aspects of the loan.&#13;
     We will not have aByone present an economic report 8.&#13;
we have already had a special meeting on that.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. DORR:   Gentlellen, there are three proposed loans&#13;
here to finance the foreign exchange part ot the costs ot&#13;
construction by the Kansa1, Kyushu and Chubu Power COllpan1e.&#13;
&amp;#12;    ot three tbermal pover stations.   Theae power stations will&#13;
lhave capacities ot 150,000, 75,000 and 66,000 kw.       They viII&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ be   located in the Kobe-Osaka area, the Nagoya area and in&#13;
    nortbern Kyusnu.&#13;
        As Mr. Black bas pointed out, the general d1souss1on ot&#13;
    the economic situation ot Japan has recently taken place in&#13;
    this Board, and certainly I haven' t anything to add to tbe&#13;
    very able remarks or Mr. Garner and my colleague Mr. de Wilde.&#13;
         I would just reoall that, as a background tor these    loans~&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  I&#13;
    Japan is raced with the problem ot major readjustment and re- !&#13;
    habilitation or her 1ndustr1al plant and her economy; that         i&#13;
    sbe is nov in a position ot having a tev years' breath1ng&#13;
    space, perhaps, during the period When sbe has these extraÂ­&#13;
    ordinary dollar expenditures to bolster up her position, and&#13;
    during that time she must try to modernize her industry and&#13;
    put herself in a poa1 t10D where she will be able to eam&#13;
    her own way in the tuture.&#13;
         Like certain other prom1nent countries, export or die 
&#13;
    is her situation, and she must put herself in a position to 
&#13;
    expand her produot1on and to make it more ett1c1ent. 
&#13;
         Twenty percent ot her tood !lUst be imported.    She spends&#13;
    about 25 percent ot her tore1gn exchange earnings to buy those&#13;
    ~ports.   And ot course she must a180   ~port   raw materials&#13;
    in order to make the things to send out to buy the tood.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 5
&#13;
&#13;
        One ot the things wh1ch 1s essent1al to th1s expans10n&#13;
and improvement ot her product1ve capac1ty generally 1s the&#13;
prov1s10n ot more electr1c power.     She 1s already short ot&#13;
                                                                      i&#13;
power, not only dur1ng the dry seasons, but over-all.        However~&#13;
                                                                      i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the shortage 1s part1cularly apparent and part1cularly burden-j&#13;
                                                                      I&#13;
&#13;
some during the low-water per10ds v.nen the ava1lab1l1ty ot&#13;
hydroelectr1c pover drops ott very sharply.&#13;
        It 1s est1Dlated that w1thin t1ve years an 1ncrease in&#13;
demand ot at least 31 percent tor power w1ll occur.&#13;
        The three pover compan1es 1nvolved here operate 1n three&#13;
ot the most important 1ndustr1al areas 1n Japan -- those&#13;
around Kobe-Osaka, Nagoya and Kyushu.        In that total area,&#13;
Wh1ch 1s southwestern Japan, 67 percent ot Japanls steel 1s&#13;
produced, about 57 percent ot her coal, 75 peroent ot her&#13;
ceram1cs, about 58 percent ot cotton text1les, 88 percent&#13;
ot wool text1les -- sh1pbu1lding, cheaical and heavy engineerÂ­&#13;
ing industries are also very     ~portant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        I wonlt attempt to discuss in detail the role ot these&#13;
three pover plants because Dr. Rembert 1s qualif1ed to handle&#13;
that.     I will just say that the expans10n otelectr1c power,&#13;
thermal generat1ng power, as a result ot the construct10n ot&#13;
these plants would be about ten percent.        That would, ot&#13;
course, add to the    t1~   pover ava1lable throughout the year&#13;
and make 1t poss1ble tor 1ndustry in general to operate at a&#13;
&#13;
h1gber level and prevent a lot ot cap1tal equ1pment trom ly1ng&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 idle 	during the lov-vater period ot the Jear.&#13;
      In addition, theae plants vill, during periods ot less&#13;
 than. maximum thermal power generation, enable ye17 large&#13;
I savings to be made through the substitution tor a much less&#13;
II etticient plant Which nov has to be used.&#13;
      COIling down to the teatures ot the proposed loan, tirst&#13;
 the suggested terms are 20 Jears at 5 percent with am.ortizatio&#13;
                                                                      I&#13;
 beginning atter a three-Jear period.      The thrâ&#128;¢â&#128;¢ proposed loans   I&#13;
 are $21.5 million tor the Kansai Caapany, $11.2 million to           i&#13;
 the Kyushu CompanJ, and $1.5 million to the Chubu Company.           I&#13;
      The general pattern is as tollovs.       There would be loan    II&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 agreements concluded vith the Japan Developaent Bank, project&#13;
 agre_ents vith the three pover com.panies, and ot COUl'se a          I&#13;
 guarautee agreement vith the Govermaent ot Japan.      The GovernÂ­&#13;
 ment ot Japan has asked that the loans be made by us to the&#13;
 Japan Developaent Bank, vhich is an agencJ ot the Japanese           I&#13;
 Governaent .et up to   ~l tore1~ fund.          end government   tund1&#13;
 into 	h igh priority economic projects.&#13;
      As I say, the Japanese Government telt that it would be&#13;
 lIOst appropriate and convenient to it i t the loans vere made&#13;
 to the Japan Development Bank rather than the pover companies,&#13;
 and the Bank: management telt that that was a reasonable reques&#13;
 to accede to, i t ve could get the appropriate engagements&#13;
 fro. the power companies themselves.&#13;
      We haYe included in the proposed project agreements vith&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       the power compan1es many ot the prov1s1ons wh1Ch you normally&#13;
       f1nd 1n our loan agreementa hav1ng to do w1th the use ot the&#13;
       loan, the carry1ng on of the project and so forth.&#13;
           The three power compan1es theaaelves are pr1vately-owned&#13;
       compan1es.    The Government 1nterest 1n two of them 1s very&#13;
       small 1ndeed.    In the Kyushu Company 1t 1s 3 percent, 1n the&#13;
       Chubu Company, 2 percent.    In the case of Kansa1, there 1s a&#13;
ii     substant1al m.1nor1ty Government 1nterest of 18 percent.   !l'he&#13;
Ii&#13;
I,&#13;
;!&#13;
;; 	   rest ot the stock 1nterest 1s pr1vately owned.&#13;
Ii&#13;
II&#13;
II&#13;
i!&#13;
           We have proposed that the Development Bank pledge to th1s&#13;
II&#13;
&#13;
i&#13;
' Bank as secur1ty for 1ta ob11gat1on the ob11gat1ons ot the&#13;
II 	&#13;
     power compan1e a to the Development Bank. The undertak1ng ot&#13;
I:&#13;
Ii those ob11gat1ons by the power compan1es to the Developaent&#13;
II&#13;
       Bank w111 carry w1th 1t-an automat1c pr1or1ty under Japanese&#13;
II law 1n favor of the Development Bank over all existing&#13;
&#13;
       cred1tors, and by this pledge, we would get the benet1t of&#13;
       that pr1or1ty.&#13;
            One other feature ot the transact10n Wh1ch may be ot&#13;
       1nterest 1s the covenant wh1Ch has been entered into w1th&#13;
       regard to power rates.    As you all know, there haa been a&#13;
       very severe 1nflat1on 1n Japan s1nce betore the war.    The&#13;
       pr1ce index 1s now about 350 ttmes -- not 350 percent -- 350&#13;
       ttmes what 1t was.     Power rates, however, are only 90 t1Bes&#13;
       as h1gh.     Therefore you can see there has been a very severe&#13;
I'&#13;
       lag 1n the earning power of the power industry.    That has&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  8-9 
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
meant~ naturally~       a dearth ot tunds tor the very necessary&#13;
expansion and has made it necessary tor the Government to&#13;
contemplate assisting the industry to a very large extent.&#13;
      We have discussed with the Government ot         Japan~   and it&#13;
itself has even betore we discussed it recognized that the&#13;
pattern   or   power rates is not one which could be continued&#13;
indetinitely into the       tuture~    and it has expressed its inÂ­&#13;
tention to us ot establishing and maintaining rates on a&#13;
basis which will give a reasonable return on the investment&#13;
and permit some retention        or   earnings so tbat at least to a&#13;
partial extent the absolutely necessary expansion can be&#13;
tinanced by the electric power consumers themselves.&#13;
      This     is~   I think, an entire tollowing out of what our&#13;
President explained at the last Annual Meeting, in whiCh, you I&#13;
recall~   he    gave~   in a way which I donÂ·t think I could improve       I&#13;
on~   tbe conSiderations which led towards the desirability ot&#13;
baving at least some ot the financing ot expansion done by&#13;
the consumers themselves.&#13;
      These power stations' equipment will be bought trom&#13;
two American suppliers -- Westinghouse and General Electric.&#13;
Contracts have already been signed.            Those companies have&#13;
agreed to participate in this loan to the extent of 25 perÂ­&#13;
                                          ri&#13;
cent ot their purchase prioe, andA.the purchase price&#13;

be received by their prinoipal suppliers, like the boiler                  I&#13;
&#13;
companies.       Asswming full   escalation~    that means that&#13;
                                                                           I&#13;

&#13;
West1nghouse w1ll part1c1pate 1n these loans to the extent of&#13;
$4.9 m1ll10n and the Internat10nal General Electr1c to the&#13;
extent of $1.24 m1llion.     These compan1es would rece1ve the&#13;
early matur1t1es and be pa1d out by July        l~   1960.&#13;
     I th1nk that 1s all that 1s necessary to add to what&#13;
has already been fully set out 1n the President's            report~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and ot course I would be glad to answer any quest10ns I can.&#13;
        I would just say 1n conclus10n that I am thoroughly              ,i&#13;
                                                                          !&#13;

&#13;
     THE CBAIRMAlf:    Thank you very   much~   Mr. Dorr.      I will&#13;
calIon Dr. Rembert before we have any quest10ns.&#13;
        DR. REMBERT:   Gentlemen, you have rece1ved a rather&#13;
deta1led report on these projects, so I w1ll conf1ne my&#13;
remarks to a short summary ot our f1nd1ngs.&#13;
        In Japan tuel 1s both scarce and expens1ve, and these&#13;
factors have been the pr1nc1pal cons1derat10n in t1xing the&#13;
des1gn and the select10n ot equ1pment tor these projects.                .&#13;
They represent a balance between Investment cost and operatlnl&#13;
cost~    and we cons1der that the select10n has been in line             ~&#13;
w1th good eng1neering pract1ce.&#13;
        We think the projects are techn1cally sound.          Inc1Â­&#13;
dentally, these are the largest and most eft1c1ent un1ts&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that the Bank has ever financed in any of its thermal           poe r&#13;
&#13;
projects.&#13;
       The estimated cost   or   the total installations varies&#13;
from $195 to $215 per 1nstal1ed k11ovatt, vh1Ch compares&#13;
favorably v1th the other projects vh1ch the Bank has f1nanced.             I&#13;
In fact, this cost is slightly lover than the average of the               I&#13;
                                                                           I&#13;
thermal projects vh1ch ve have f1nanced to date.             We consider   I&#13;
this cost to be entirely reasonable.&#13;
       The companies vh1Ch v1ll own and operate these projects             I&#13;
are large enterprises, even when compared with utilit7 campanil.&#13;
1n the United States and other parts of the         vorl~.     They        I&#13;
                                                                           I&#13;

1nvo1ve both hydro and stesa pover generation along with very&#13;
extensive transa1ss1on and       ~1str1but1on   works.&#13;
       While the,. vere established onl,. 1n 1951, they are 1n&#13;
reality not nev companies 1n relation to management and&#13;
operat1ng personnel.    It vas simply a reorganization of the&#13;
&#13;
ut111t,. systems in Japan resulting from denationalization of&#13;
national power companies that had been established during the ,&#13;
war.&#13;
       We consider that the management and operating personnel&#13;
are thoroughly experienced and competent to carryon an&#13;
enterprise of this type.&#13;
       Each of these projects is a part of more extensive&#13;
expansion prosr.8ms to be carried out by the three companies.&#13;
Most of the work in these programs is 81ther under&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    12

. construction at the present time or tully committed.           Each&#13;
 company also has an improvement program designed to reduce&#13;
 S7stam 10S88S and improve the general operating etticlenC7&#13;
 01'   their generat10g plants.&#13;
        We consider the execution ot these programs as essentlal&#13;
 to the continued operation ot these companies as sound&#13;
utilities~       and ve have theretore required assurances as to&#13;
 the completion 01' both the improvement and expansion programs.&#13;
        I'ow~   on the f10ancial   side~   the present and future&#13;
 capital structures 01' the companies leaves sODething to be&#13;
 desired.       Tbe proportion 01' abare capital in each ot them is&#13;
 very thin, but it rather large revaluation reserves are taken&#13;
 into    account~   the debt eqult7 ratio will be, on completion ot&#13;
 these prOgrUls, somewhat better than two to one.&#13;
        As 10 the case    or   most utility companies throughout the&#13;
 world today, the tinancial soundness and their abl1ity to&#13;
 tlnance tuture expansion depends on an adequate rate&#13;
 structure.       In the case ot these companies, rate increases&#13;
 ot trom 10 to 30 percent will be required to keep them in a&#13;
 sound posi tion.      The Governaant has recognlzed this 8ituation&#13;
 and will undertake to establish rates which are required tor&#13;
 this purpose.&#13;
         THE CRAIRMAll:   Thank you, sir.     Any   questions?   Any&#13;
