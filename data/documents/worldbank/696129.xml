LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:             Dominican Republic.&#13;
Implementing&#13;
Agency:               Secretariat of State of Public Works and Communications (SEOPC).&#13;
Beneficiary:          SEOPC.&#13;
Poverty Category:     This project does not specifically address poverty reduction. It is not&#13;
included in the Program of Targeted Interventions. Nevertheless, it&#13;
includes programs and policies that enhance growth, thereby creating&#13;
employment and reducing poverty. It will also contribute to improve&#13;
access of rural areas to market and services and to form and strengthen&#13;
small enterprises that will be involved in routine maintenance contracts,&#13;
which will benefit low-income communities from their employment&#13;
under those contracts.&#13;
Loan Amount:          US$75 million.&#13;
Terms:                Standard amortization term, grace period and interest rate for fixed-&#13;
rate US dollar single currency loan with an expected disbursement&#13;
period of 3-6 years.&#13;
Commitment Fee:       0.75 percent on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing, less any waiver.&#13;
Net Present Value:    All subprojects will meet eligibility criteria that assess institutional,&#13;
environmental and technical factors (including the sustainability of the&#13;
investments) as well as economic benefits. The economic criteria&#13;
establish a benchmark minimum rate of return of 12 percent, based on a&#13;
cost/benefit analysis. The economic analysis of the civil works sub-&#13;
projects yields a net present value of US$99.3 million and a prorated&#13;
internal economic rate of return of about 24.5%.&#13;
Financing Plan:       See para. 2.8.&#13;

1. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR SETTING&#13;
EcoNOMIc SETrING&#13;
1.1   After vigorous economic growth from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1970s, Dominican&#13;
Republic's economy deteriorated sharply during the 1980s. GDP per capita decreased from&#13;
US$1,290 in 1982 to US$774 in 1990 (an annual decrease of about 7% compared with the 6%&#13;
annual growth in the 1970s). During that period unemployment rose from 18% to 25%, the&#13;
external debt rose to 63.6% of GDP, international reserves decreased sharply and inflation rose to&#13;
about 100%. To address this economic situation, the Government started implementing an&#13;
economic stabilization program in mid- 1990, based on a shift towards the free-market system.&#13;
This included continued liberalization of the currency exchange rate, which has reduced inflation&#13;
to less than 10%, increased international reserves significantly and enabled the country to clear all&#13;
arrears to the international financing institutions. GDP has also grown at about 4% per year over&#13;
the five years since the program started.&#13;
1.2   The economy badly needs further improvement as a large percentage of the population of&#13;
7.5 million continues to live below the poverty level. Any strategy for improvement should,&#13;
however, take into consideration the substantial structural changes in the economy since the 1970,&#13;
namely the shifting of the economic backbone from the primary sector, i.e. sugar, ferronickel, etc.,&#13;
to the tertiary sector, with dramatic growth in tourism, industries in the free trade zones (mostly&#13;
garments and pharmaceuticals) and small service enterprises which currently account for about&#13;
60% of GDP. Such a strategy would emphasize: (a) completing the fiscal measures and free-&#13;
market drive undertaken under the 1990 stabilization program, (b) improving the basic&#13;
infrastructure necessary for energy, transport, agriculture, education and health, (c) implementing&#13;
a philosophy of governance that would shift the government's role from operating productive&#13;
assets, directing industry and economic processes to that of monitoring, regulating, setting policy&#13;
and standards and creating enabling conditions for strong private sector participation and for&#13;
economic development. The sustainable development of the tertiary sector would depend very&#13;
heavily on an adequate transport system, particularly roads, which are the backbone of the&#13;
transport system.&#13;
TRANSPORT SECTOR OVERVIEW&#13;
1.3   General. DR's sustainable economic development relies heavily on the transport system&#13;
to provide efficient access to tourism growth poles, free trade zones and markets for primary&#13;
agricultural production and mining output. The imputed costs of transport, which depends upon&#13;
the physical condition of the infrastructure and the efficiency of the transport industry, has a very&#13;
significant incidence on the sale price of goods. In the DR, the cost differential for a heavy truck&#13;
on a road in good condition compared to one in a bad state could be as high as US$0.16 per km,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
which translates into a transport cost difference of between 12% and 18% for an average truck&#13;
trip and between 2% and 4% in the final cost to the consumer.&#13;
1.4    Transport Infrastructure. DR's transport infrastructure is generally adequate both in&#13;
extent, quantity and in providing access to the 48.442 km2 of surface area and its 7.5 million&#13;
population. The provision of new facilities is therefore generally not of high priority in the&#13;
immediate to medium-term. The system, which consists of some 5,000 km of highways, 14,000&#13;
km of rural roads, 1,700 km of railways for transporting sugar cane, 15 commercial ports, of&#13;
which 3 are major ports, and 7 intemational airports, 8 domestic airdromes and 29 landing strips,&#13;
require maintenance, rehabilitation and improvement due to insufficient maintenance in the past.&#13;
1.5    Transport Operations. Road transport is the dorninant mode for domestic transport&#13;
both for goods and passengers (about 95% for goods and 100% for passengers), railways account&#13;
for 5% of cargo (3.9 million tons per year, mostly sugar cane), domestic air transport and all&#13;
other modes are almost null for both, cargo and passenger mobility. Road transport operations are&#13;

95% handled by the private sector while rail transport is 60% govemment-owned. The road&#13;
vehicle fleet in circulation is about 460,000 vehicles, growing annually at 6.6% compared to a&#13;
population growth of 2.3%. The vehicle ownership rate of about 57 vehicles per 1000 inhabitants&#13;
is high for countries with sirnilar GDP .&#13;
1.6    Sea and air transport are the dominant modes for intemational freight and passengers&#13;
respectively. International freight traffic (about 9 million tons in 1994) is 97% transported by sea,&#13;
of which 85% corresponds to imports, 9% to exports and 6% to in transit cargo. In the last 10&#13;
years, freight traffic by sea increased at 14% per annum. The economy is highly dependent on&#13;
imported petroleum and its derivative products (40% of the total imports). Air passenger&#13;
transport increased at a rate of about 4% between 1985 and 1994. During 1994 almost 2 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
international passengers visited the Dominican Republic using mainly Las Americas and Puerto&#13;
Plata international airports for regular and charter flights, as weli as Punta Cana and La Romana&#13;
airports for tourist charter services. International air transport is handled by two domestic airlines&#13;
companies and several foreign carriers. The Government is studying several offers from external&#13;
air carriers to concession the services and routes of the Dominican Aviation Company, the&#13;
national carrier, which is no longer operating under huge financial losses.&#13;
1.7   Institutional Set-Up. The Secretariat of State of Public Works and Communications&#13;
(SEOPC) has responsibility for overall transport sector management. In practice, however,&#13;
SEOPC's action is mainly concentrated on the roads sub-sector, for which it is responsible for&#13;
planning, maintenance, rehabilitation and construction as well as for the control of road traffic&#13;
signalization and issuing of driver's licenses. SEOPC's organizational structure for roads has been&#13;
improved during the implementation of loans 2609-DO and 33 50-DO and now is generally&#13;
adequate, except for certain weaknesses in financial management and internal audit functions (see&#13;
paras. 1.9 and 1.10).&#13;
1.8   The Directorate of Road Maintenance, a weak institution within SEOPC, is receiving&#13;
technical assistance financed under the ongoing Loan 3350-DO to revise its structure and improve&#13;
management practices. The Dominican Port Authority (APD) administers the five principal ports,&#13;
the Directorate General of Customs administers seven and two are in private hands. The&#13;
Government is transferring the responsibility for all ports to APD. The final objective is for APD&#13;
to concession all port operations to private operators. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation&#13;
handles the regulatory aspects of civil aviation while the Commission on Civil Aviation is&#13;
responsible for the administrative and policy aspects. In the rail sub-sector, the State Sugar Board&#13;
(CEA) is responsible for the 1,014 km owned by the Government while the private sector&#13;
manages its own 675 km. Other entities which intervene in transport sector matters include: (a)&#13;
the Technical Office of Land Transport (OTTT), which plans and oversees urban transport, (b)&#13;
the National Planning Office (ONAPLAN), which integrates the transport sector plans with the&#13;
national plan; (c) the Secretariat of Industry and Commerce (SEIC), which participates in&#13;
transport tariff setting and (d) the local authorities, on issues involving the exploitation of&#13;
minerals, quarries and other facilities in their areas.&#13;
1.9   Financial Management. During project preparation a broad revision of SEOPC's&#13;
administrative structure was performed, as the entity in charge of project execution. Special&#13;
attention was given to the organization and the functions of the SEOPC's General Directorate of&#13;
the Administration and its three basic functions: Accounting, Budget and Treasury. Annex 1&#13;
presents the conclusions regarding the administrative systems and the financial management&#13;
structure of the SEOPC. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has financed an external&#13;
consulting work covering the financial management and institutional and administrative processes.&#13;
The recommendations of the work were found acceptable and should be implemented during the&#13;
life of the proposed project.&#13;
1.10 Particular reference is made in Annex 1 to the structure, functions, dependency, terms of&#13;
reference and working program of the Internal Audit Unit. Under the model recommended&#13;
during project appraisal, the internal audit function and unit could be renamed Internal&#13;
Performance Audit. A highlight of the recommended structure and organization is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
establishment in that unit of two complementary groups of professionals: one for the financial-&#13;
administrative aspects, and the other for the economy, efficiency, effectiveness, engineering and&#13;
environmental follow-up, including field visits of projects' execution.&#13;
1.11  Government's Transport Sector Policy and Investments. The Government's transport&#13;
sector policy and strategy for 1995 and beyond are outlined in a Policy Letter sent to the Bank&#13;
(Annex 2). The following sections summarize key aspects of government policy.&#13;
1.12  It is government's policy to promote competition among road transport operators. The&#13;
Government only intervenes in the setting of road-user charges, road safety and vehicle&#13;
inspection, axle load controls and setting of passenger fares. Axle load enforcement is being&#13;
improved under the ongoing Loan 3350-DO, which is studying the possible reduction in the&#13;
current 13-ton single axle load limit, designing a system of axle load control and purchasing weigh&#13;
bridges to control axle loads. Further Government involvement in the transport sector is mainly&#13;
limited to urban passenger transport, for which it sets tariffs, licenses operators and assigns routes&#13;
and frequencies. There is minimum interference in freight transport and inter-urban passenger&#13;
services.&#13;
1.13 Full cost recovery is a high priority. In the roads subsector, the Government has ensured&#13;
and will continue to do so that sufficient revenues are raised through road user charges to cover,&#13;
at least, road maintenance and rehabilitation. Previously, those charges were inadequate when the&#13;
price of gasoline was low. For ports, the Government's policy is to concession port operations to&#13;
the private sector to make them financially self-sufficient. For railways, the Government has&#13;
abandoned lines when their traffic levels have made their operation uneconomic. For civil&#13;
aviation, the Government is examining offers from foreign airlines to operate the routes and&#13;
services of the uneconomic state-owned carrier.&#13;
1.14  The Government's sector policy also aims to complete reconstruction of the entire&#13;
highway network, eliminating bottlenecks in that network and improving maintenance; it also&#13;
gives high priority to constructing those roads necessary to integrate the tourist areas on the&#13;
northern and eastern shore with the rest of the transport network.&#13;
1.15  Over the period 1989 to 1995, transport sector investments have accounted for between&#13;
13% to 21% of total public sector investment. Roads have received over 90% of the transport&#13;
investments, mostly for reconstruction and rehabilitation of interurban roads and for construction&#13;
of city streets.&#13;
ROAD TRANSPORT&#13;
1.16 General. Roads are the backbone of the transport system. Internal cargo traffic consists&#13;
mainly of exports of commodities to the ports (sugar, coffee, cacao and minerals) and transport of&#13;
agricultural products from the central regions to Santo Domingo and of industrial and consumer&#13;
goods from Santo Domingo to the rest of the country. Tourist centers depend heavily on road&#13;
infrastructure for improving its quality of service and expansion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.17 Road Network. The road network under the responsibility of the SEOPC totals about&#13;
19,000 km (August 1995), of which 5,000 km are highways and the rest rural roads being&#13;
rehabilitated or reconstructed with IDB financing. The highway network is relatively extensive.&#13;
No significant new construction is required, except for a few links to connect some tourist areas&#13;
to the highway network and the elimination of some bottlenecks in the trunk network to reduce&#13;
traffic congestion and improve road safety, both matters of concern in the present situation. At&#13;
present, the Government is financing the widening to four separate lanes of the Duarte highway&#13;
between Santo Domingo and Santiago (the two largest cities in the country), at a cost of about&#13;
RD$3,000 million (US$234 million) and starting the reconstruction of about 300 km of the&#13;
highway bordering Haiti, between Montecristi, in the north, and Jimani, in the south. The&#13;
reconstruction of this highway, which is strategically very important, will also improve access to&#13;
rural markets in a region of the country with high incidence of poverty.&#13;
1.18  Network Condition. The most recent information on the network condition (Table 1.3)&#13;
indicates that 81% of the paved highways (3,831 km) are in good or fair condition. Out of the&#13;
19% in poor condition, 14.3% is under rehabilitation to be completed by 1997 and the remaining&#13;
4.7%, will be reconstructed under the proposed project. About 70% of the unpaved highway&#13;
network (1,222 km), is in poor condition and in need of rehabilitation or reconstruction. The&#13;
SEOPC is studying the economic feasibility of paving highways with more than 150 vehicles per&#13;
day, a threshold generally accepted as generating economic rates of return of 12% and above.&#13;
Based on this criterion, the Government has already contracted paving of 189 km of the network.&#13;

1.19 Traffic. The average traffic volume in the highway network is: 1280 vehicles per day&#13;
(vpd) with the following distribution: 2,650 vpd in highways with pavement of asphalt or cement&#13;
concrete (2,108 krm); 370 vpd in highways with surface treatments (1,723 km); and 193 vpd in&#13;
unpaved highways (1,222 km). About 15% of the vehicles are trucks in all surfaces. Traffic&#13;
growth in the period 1986-1994 was respectively 3.9%, 2.6% and insignificant per year. These&#13;
figures show a network with medium-high traffic as an average, which is consistent with the size,&#13;
economic activity, population and relatively short travel distances (125 km on average).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.20 Axle Loads. Maximum axle loads were established in 1976 at 13,000 kg for single axles&#13;
(four wheels) and 19,500 kg for tandem axles (eight wheels), with a provision for a reduction of&#13;
these maxima for axles with fewer wheels. The limits are high compared to those in other Latin&#13;
American countries, but are consistent with Bank sponsored research in developing countries,&#13;
which shows that the optimum for the economy as a whole is set in the range 12-13 tons for&#13;
single axles. To control vehicle axle loads, the ongoing loan 3350-DO finances construction of&#13;
permanent weighing stations and acquisition of additional mobile weighing scales, which are&#13;
starting to operate. On the other hand, the number of two-axle trucks, the most generally&#13;
overloaded and damaging to the pavements, is decreasing at a rate of 1 .1% per year, while the&#13;
number of multiple axle-trucks is increasing, as a consequence of the exemption by the&#13;
Government of some tariffs for this type of truck.&#13;
1.21  Road Administration. Planning, engineering, construction and maintenance of roads are&#13;
the responsibility of the SEOPC. Those tasks are performed by four directorates: planning&#13;
(Direcci6n General de Planeamiento y Programaci6n-DGPP), engineering (Direcci6n General de&#13;
Carreteras-DGC), construction (Direcci6n General de Fiscalizaci6n de Obras-DGFO) and&#13;
maintenance (Direcci6n General de Mantenimiento-DGM). In addition, there is a department for&#13;
policies and preparation of bidding documents (Direcci6n de Reglamentos y Sistemas-DRS)&#13;
another for management of external resources (Direcci6n de Administraci6n de Recursos&#13;
Externos-DARE) and a legal advisor, reporting directly to the Secretary of State. The Advisor to&#13;
the Secretary of State is the General Coordinator for the implementation of projects with external&#13;
financing. He is assisted by a local consultant in the case of the Fifth Highway Rehabilitation and&#13;
Maintenance Project (FHRNP - Loan 3350-DO). Details of the structure of the road&#13;
administration are included in Annex 3.&#13;
1.22  The quality of SEOPC's engineers is reasonable, although better pay in the private sector&#13;
resulted in the past in high staff tumover. To prevent this, the SEOPC allows to skilled staff&#13;
outside employment after working hours as a supplement of their salaries. This solution, while&#13;
successful in retaining staff, cannot be considered satisfactory because sometimes is difficult to&#13;
separate in time and content both activities, so reducing the quality and capacity of that staff for&#13;
carrying out his official activities. Therefore, the mentioned solution should be provisional until a&#13;
civil service reform and/or a road agency is implemented, allowing to pay skilled staff competitive&#13;
salaries with those in the private sector.&#13;
1.23  Environmental Management. The Department for the Control of Earth Excavation&#13;
(DCCT), the environmental unit within the SEOPC, was established by law in 1971. The DCCT&#13;
is responsible for monitoring environmental pollution and entrusted with protecting the ecology&#13;
and environment through prevention of indiscriminate excavation. Its specific tasks are the&#13;
following: (i) regulate excavation permits to prevent indiscriminate excavation and destruction of&#13;
agricultural areas, beaches and rivers; (ii) document environmental implications of every request&#13;
for excavation; and (iii) monitor earth excavation works after permits are issued and stop&#13;
excavation works which are improperly executed and impose fines on violators.&#13;
1.24  At present, SEOPC's capability to address environmental issues associated with roads and&#13;
other transport projects is weak. The DCCT has not fully developed the capabilities and technical&#13;
experience to effectively address environmental concerns in the sector and is understaffed and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
without a clear role in the day-to-day environmental functions within SEOPC. An Action Plan for&#13;
strengthening the DCCT was agreed during project appraisal, which includes: (i) technical&#13;
assistance to implement proposed functions and procedures; (ii) special studies such as an&#13;
ecological sensitivity map for road infrastructure; (iii) equipment including vehicles, computers,&#13;
and geographical information systems; and (iv) training program for the DCCT. The proposed&#13;
project would support this Action Plan (see para. 2.6, d), which is also supported by the IDB&#13;
Rural Roads Project .&#13;
1.25  The new environmental responsibilities of the DCCT would also include the following:&#13;
(i) advising the SEOPC on environmental concerns in the transport sector; (ii) incorporating&#13;
environmental objectives into feasibility and design studies; (iii) establishing environmental&#13;
policies and procedures for road and other transport projects; (iv) ensuring compliance with the&#13;
Environmental Manual for Road designers and Contractors prepared during project preparation&#13;
(see para. 2.7); (v) ensuring that all bidding documents and contracts contain the appropriate&#13;
environmental conditions; (vi) monitoring environmental factors and maintaining a database; (vii)&#13;
keeping appropriate records of the costs associated with monitoring and training activities of the&#13;
Unit; (viii) designing and maintaining the records based on which the quarterly and annual reports&#13;
would be prepared; and (ix) establishing basic internal administrative controls on the activities and&#13;
follow-up of the consulting work. The SEOPC will provide the necessary funds in the budget to&#13;
operate the strengthened DCCT.&#13;
1.26 Budget. The SEOPC budget is approved annually by the Congress. Budget allocations&#13;
to the transport sector have varied between 12% and 20% of total Government expenditures in&#13;
the period 1989-94. While this aggregate level was reasonable, insufficient funds were allocated&#13;
to routine maintenance. This was due to the emphasis put on the reconstruction and rehabilitation&#13;
programs. Since these programs are well advanced, in the future expenditures will be reallocated&#13;
in favor of road maintenance and stricter application of economic criteria for the selection of road&#13;
investments.&#13;
1.27  Construction Industry. Construction is being carried out by contractors, both local and&#13;
foreign, frequently in joint- ventures. In the past, most government contracts were awarded to&#13;
private contractors who did not have adequate experience nor the capacity to carry out the works&#13;
at adequate standards. Prequalification of contractors and packaging of contracts comprising 50&#13;
km or more, introduced under Loan 3350-DO, have substantially contributed to speed-up&#13;
completion, improve quality and enhance competition, leading to satisfactory implementation of&#13;
civil works. Furthermore, the contractors of the works under that loan have become fully&#13;
familiarized with Bank's bidding requirements and documents for contraction of civil works. The&#13;
Loan 3350-DO also finances a study on the local construction industry (including local branches&#13;
of foreign firms) and its capacity with respect to the implementation of the proposed project. The&#13;
study, once completed, will be incorporated into the Project File. A preliminary report shows that&#13;
the capacity is far enough to carry out the SEOPC's investment and maintenance programs during&#13;
the project period.&#13;
1.28  Private Sector Participation. Public/private partnerships in the road sector has been&#13;
successfully practiced to finance some access to tourist areas mostly in the eastern coast, which is&#13;
the most important tourist development pole in the country. Legislation is being prepared to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
make possible a new form of public/private partnership in the road sector (concessions of&#13;
construction, maintenance and operation of toll roads, bridges and tunnels and other related&#13;
infrastructure to the private sector under BOT or BOO schemes). Once this legislation is&#13;
approved, it is expected that future major investments in high traffic highways will be financed&#13;
with a substantial contribution by the private sector. A preliminary study of widening the highway&#13;
Santo Domingo-Las Americas Airport-San Pedro de Macoris, which links the capital with its&#13;
international airport, the third port in the country and the most developed tourist area, and&#13;
subsequent maintenance by toll road concession is being financed under the Loan 3350-DO. The&#13;
proposed project would finance a similar study for the Santo Domingo San Cristobal-Bani&#13;
highway (para. 2.6).&#13;
1.29 Operations and Maintenance. The entire network is publicly owned and operated, but&#13;
all construction works (including new construction, reconstruction and rehabilitation) and all&#13;
programmable periodic maintenance for the highway network are contracted to the private sector.&#13;
This policy, combined with effective supervision by independent consulting firms and the major&#13;
effort of the Government in recent years to rehabilitate the highway network has resulted in&#13;
substantial improvement in the network condition. Nevertheless, as part of the proposed project&#13;
monitoring, reporting and supervision plan, the project would introduce engineering (technical)&#13;
auditing. This is an innovation to ensure consistency in work supervision, develop capacity within&#13;
the SEOPC to monitor work quality, evaluate the results of the introduction of routine&#13;
maintenance by contract and support annual and midterm reviews of the physical performance of&#13;
the project.&#13;
1.30 Maintenance has been traditionally carried out by the SEOPC under force account. The&#13;
implementation of Loan 3350-DO initiated a change in this practice and now periodic&#13;
maintenance for the highway network is contracted out. Routine maintenance planning and&#13;
control has substantially improved under technical assistance financed under the ongoing Loan&#13;
3350-DO. However, routine maintenance execution continues to be carried out by force account.&#13;
The proposed project includes a pilot program to introduce routine maintenance by contract and&#13;
to foster contracting out 100% of all programmable maintenance by year 2001 (see Table 1.4).&#13;
Under this pilot program, small enterprises will be encouraged to participate in maintenance with&#13;
SEOPC's equipment rented by the contractors, if necessary. Emergency works will continue to&#13;
be carried out mostly by force account. The increase in maintenance by contract will also allow a&#13;
substantial reduction in the number of SEOPC unskilled staff (see Annex 3).&#13;

1.31  Highway Investment Plan. The SEOPC has prepared a four-year (1997-2000) Highway&#13;
Investment Plan (HIP), which will be annually reviewed and agreed with the Bank, including the&#13;
following programs: (i) reconstruction or rehabilitation of the highways that will remain in&#13;
deteriorated condition at the end of 1996 and need rehabilitation or reconstruction; (ii) widening&#13;
of some sections with high traffic volumes and high rate of accidents; (iii) construction of bridges&#13;
and by-passes of some cities, to eliminate bottlenecks and improve road safety; and (iv)&#13;
completion of the widening to four divided lanes of the Duarte (Santo Domingo-Santiago)&#13;
highway, under construction with government financing. The total cost of those programs is&#13;
about US$325 million, of which the Government will finance US$250 million, or US$62.5&#13;
rnillion per year, which is in line with the amounts spent in the last ten years. The proposed project&#13;
will help the Government to finance the first three programs.&#13;
1.32 Maintenance Programs. Maintenance planing has been practiced since 1990, allowing&#13;
the SEOPC to prepare annual maintenance budgets, based on measures of expected work&#13;
performance. Prior to that time, the budgets approved have been in accordance with those&#13;
proposed by the DGM, but the amounts finally spent were below the approved ones and there&#13;
was no control on the activities in which they were actually spent. The situation has substantially&#13;
improved since the beginning of the implementation of the Maintenance Management System&#13;
(MMS) under technical assistance financed by the ongoing Loan 3350-DO, which is starting to&#13;
produce positive results.&#13;
1.33 During the preparation of the proposed project, the Highway Maintenance Programs for&#13;
1997-2000 were prepared, with the assistance of the consultants implementing the MMS. A&#13;
summary of those programs is presented in Annex 3. The programs were prepared considering a&#13;
level of maintenance defined by a set of quantity standards with modifying factors according to&#13;
pavement condition, surface type, climatic regions, pavement age and policies (e.g. manual or&#13;
mechanical execution). The length of the network considered under maintenance each year was&#13;
the total of the highway network, excluding the part of the network in reconstruction during the&#13;
project period. The highways under reconstruction were included in the program of routine the&#13;
first year after completing their reconstruction and in the program of periodic maintenance after&#13;
four years.&#13;
1.34 The total maintenance budget for 1997-2000 is US$51 million, of which US$24 million is&#13;
for routine maintenance and US$27 million for periodic maintenance. One pilot program for&#13;
routine maintenance by contract and one program for highway resurfacing with new technologies,&#13;
introduced under Loan 3350-DO, have been prepared with selected works from the maintenance&#13;
programs and would be financed by the proposed project.&#13;
1.35  Road Financing and User Charges. Traditionally, all vehicles collectively have&#13;
generated more than sufficient revenues to finance road maintenance and rehabilitation. The main&#13;
source of those revenues has been taxes on petroleum products (91% of the total) and import&#13;
duties for vehicles and parts (7.5%). During the 1980s, because of a lag in adjusting the prices of&#13;
gasoline and diesel, those revenues totaled only RD$14 million in 1989, significantly less than the&#13;
RD$60 million required just for highway maintenance and rehabilitation. The situation was&#13;
drastically reversed in 1990 with the Government raising the price of fuel products leading to their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
1995 level of RD$13.50 (US$1.04) per gallon of diesel and RD$20 (US$1.54) for gasoline. At&#13;
this level, revenues from the fuel taxes amount to about US$300 million per year and are four&#13;
times the total annual road expenditures for construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance in the next five years (about US$75 million per year).&#13;
1.36 Road Fund. The maintenance expenditures will stabilize at around US$13 million per&#13;
year when the whole highway network is in good condition and all programmable maintenance is&#13;
contracted in year 2001. Rehabilitation needs will stabilize at around US$17 million, an amount&#13;
substantially lower than in the past seven years. To ensure that adequate funds will be allocated&#13;
to maintain and rehabilitate the highway network, making sustainable the gains achieved under&#13;
previous operations (particularly under Loan 3350-DO), the FHRMP has assisted the SEOPC in&#13;
designing and implementing a dedicated road fund with an initial provision of around US$30&#13;
million equivalent per year, including salaries and administrative and operational expenses. The&#13;
proceeds of a road tariff, consisting of vehicle license fees, road tolls and a levy from the current&#13;
price of fuel, would be deposited into the road fund to be implemented during the project period.&#13;
Once the road fund is operative, it could also be progressively expanded to cover rural and urban&#13;
road expenditures for roads already rehabilitated or reconstructed.&#13;
1.37 The rationale for introducing the Road Fund is based more on the need to reinforce the&#13;
political independence of the resources for road maintenance and incorporate the oversight of&#13;
users over the timely application of those resources, rather than to generate the funds needed for&#13;
road maintenance and rehabilitation. These funds already come from the revenues collected from&#13;
fuel taxes and therefore, the implementation of the Fund will not have fiscal implications nor will&#13;
divert revenues from other purposes; it will just redirect the funds from the general budget to the&#13;
Fund. In that respect, drafting and passing the legislation to establish the Road Fund is as&#13;
important as defining the road tariffs, mechanisms for road users participation, cost accounting&#13;
methods and other technical details that will make the fund work or fail in the long run. In&#13;
addition, developing a constituency for road maintenance--already taking place as the&#13;
reconstruction program is completed and contracting out of maintenance works expands--will be&#13;
formalized through their participation in the Road Fund. The manner to incorporate this&#13;
constituency, the mechanisms for the functioning of the Road Fund, the composition and the level&#13;
or resources to be incorporated into it, and the necessary legislation, are all part of the technical&#13;
assistance financed by the FHRMP (see Annex 3).&#13;
1.38 Road Agency. The road fund would be managed by a new road agency to be called&#13;
"Oficina Nacional de Mantenimiento Vial" (ONMV), which would ensure: (i) an effective&#13;
organization structure and reporting requirements; (ii) adequate staffing, with competitive&#13;
salaries; and, (iii) adequate internal systems/controls and streamlined procedures. The ONMV&#13;
would be managed by a representative board of management, including representatives from the&#13;
public and private sectors and road users . The aim of a representative board of management is to&#13;
win public support for the necessary road spending and to ensure that funds are spent in line with&#13;
perceived needs of users and beneficiaries. The proposed project would support the&#13;
implementation of both the road fund and the agency (see para. 2.6, d). Although the intention is&#13;
to establish the fund and the agency under a new legal framework, it may prove feasible to&#13;
establish them under existing administrative procedures within the current legal framework. The&#13;
new legislation or the existing administrative procedures should provide for: (i) the creation of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
road fund which will finance the cost of maintenance and rehabilitation of roads within the&#13;
Borrower's road network; and (ii) the creation of a new road entity (ONMV) which will operate&#13;
such financing mechanism.&#13;
PREVIOUS BANK INVOLVEMENT IN TBE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
1.39 Previous Bank Experience. The Bank's past involvement in the road transport sub-&#13;
sector dates back to 1973, when it acted as the executing agency for the UNDP-financed&#13;
Highway Rehabilitation and Administration Study. Between 1976 and 1985, three highway&#13;
projects were financed under Bank loans, totaling US$65 million, to improve the condition of&#13;
some 320 km, or about six percent of the highway network. Those projects were: the First Road&#13;
Maintenance and Reconstruction Project; the Emergency Road Reconstruction Project; and the&#13;
Second Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project.&#13;
1.40 In 1986 the fourth operation, the Third Road Reconstruction Project (Loan 2609-DO,&#13;
US$35.8 million) was approved. It provided financing for: reconstruction of 150 km of highways&#13;
that were started under Loan 1784-DO, and about 60 km of other high-priority highways;&#13;
purchase of road maintenance equipment and spare parts; consulting services for construction&#13;
supervision; a transport planning study; and assistance in training the pavement division staff of&#13;
DGPP and in organizing workshops and stores. Generally, the project was executed as planned&#13;
and completed on December 31, 1993. Annex 4 provides details on the implementation of these&#13;
four operations.&#13;
1.41  Lessons Learned. In general, the projects' scope was appropriate for the country's needs,&#13;
but their implementation was beset by problems which delayed their completion. Most of the&#13;
roads were finished almost on schedule. However, the completion of some reconstruction works&#13;
took longer than originally scheduled. In retrospect, the problems with these roads could have&#13;
been avoided had more attention been given during project preparation to avoid repetition of&#13;
problems previously experienced by the SEOPC, namely, starting project implementation with&#13;
inadequately prepared engineering and bidding documents, deficient planning and programming&#13;
for the execution of the road works initially included in the project, and inappropriate awarding of&#13;
works to unqualified contractors.&#13;
1.42  The lessons learned confirm that to ensure successful implementation of Bank's projects it&#13;
is necessary, during the project preparation stage, to emphasize the need for uncompromising&#13;
quality of engineering designs and bidding documents, and contracting qualified contractors and&#13;
consultants. Other issues which should have been addressed concerned the Borrower's sense of&#13;
ownership of some project components (in particular planning studies) and its commitment to&#13;
support and achieve the agreed project objectives for those components by providing the required&#13;
human and financial resources and logistic support. On the other hand, the Third Road&#13;
Reconstruction Project, demonstrated in its second half of implementation, the benefit of&#13;
maintaining an open and productive dialogue with the Borrower, which resulted in a more&#13;
intensive involvement of SEOPC's higher level staff in the execution of the project, facilitating the&#13;
project's successful implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
1.43  Ongoing Project. The Fifth Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Loan 3350-&#13;
DO, US$79 million, 1991) was declared effective on December 2, 1992. The project comprises:&#13;
(a) rehabilitation of about 830 km of roads and supervision of these works; (b) a technology&#13;
transfer program on pavements, including technical assistance and civil works; (c) bridge and&#13;
workshop rehabilitation; (d) equipment rehabilitation; (e) acquisition of road signaling materials,&#13;
maintenance equipment and scales for vehicle weight control; and (f) technical assistance for&#13;
training, road maintenance management, an urban transport study, a local construction industry&#13;
study and engineering services for road design.&#13;
1.44 Past lessons learned have helped to ensure successful implementation. Prequalification of&#13;
contractors and bidding documents were agreed at negotiations; International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) procedures were applied to all civil works of the road rehabilitation program;&#13;
engineering designs and bidding documents were prepared well in advance of the bidding process;&#13;
and the open dialogue with the Borrower continued. As a result, procurement is already&#13;
completed; the contract for the pavement technology transfer program (a major component) and&#13;
technical assistance in highway management are satisfactorily underway; compliance with loan&#13;
covenants and the Action Plan is acceptable; and about 75% of the loan is already disbursed.&#13;
1.45 However, the proceeds of the Loan will only reach to finance about 70% of the highway&#13;
length originally programmed to be rehabilitated. The main reasons for this reduction are cost&#13;
increases for civil works, due to higher unit costs and the additional road deterioration that took&#13;
place since the project was appraised and, above all, the upgrade of most of the works from&#13;
rehabilitation to reconstruction. On the other hand, the SEOPC rehabilitated more than 900 km in&#13;
the same period with local funds, which is more than the length finally not financed by the loan.&#13;
The technology transfer program, a single component and the biggest contract of the project&#13;
(including about 500 kms of highway resurfacing) is being implemented as planned and within the&#13;
resources allocated in the Loan. The Loan Closing Date, December 31, 1996, was extended to&#13;
December 31, 1997 on November 4, 1996 to allow completion of already advanced contracts.&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
2.1   Completion of the modernization of the highway network and removal of important&#13;
bottlenecks in the highway network are essential to the development of the major sources of&#13;
economic growth (tourism, industries in the free trade zones and small service enterprises).&#13;
2.2   Maintenance neglect between 1980 and 1986 led to a badly deteriorated road network,&#13;
which could only be corrected by rehabilitation or reconstruction. The first step in that direction&#13;
was the reconstruction program financed by Loan 2609-DO (para. 1.40). Reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation of the highway network has continued, financed by the Government with local funds&#13;
and by Loan 3350-DO. This loan (para. 1.43) also extensively introduced periodic maintenance&#13;
by contract, a program of pavement technology transfer and technical assistance in maintenance&#13;
management, setting the grounds for a solid maintenance environment and preventing the&#13;
repetition of the mistakes in the past.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.3   As a result of the investments in reconstruction and rehabilitation during the past seven&#13;
years, the highway network condition has improved to the point that, when the ongoing project is&#13;
completed, only 169 km of paved highways will remain in poor condition and need rehabilitation.&#13;
At present, with no significant new construction required, with the exception of a few links to&#13;
connect some tourist areas to the highway network, the emphasis has to be put in: (a) eliminating&#13;
bottlenecks in the trunk network (widening some sections that are insufficient for the high traffic&#13;
volumes they carry, and replacing some bridges and urban sections with insufficient geometric and&#13;
structural conditions); (b) completing the reconstruction of the highway network; (c)&#13;
consolidating the important technical and institutional gains achieved under previous operations&#13;
(particularly under Loan 3350-DO); and (d) ensuring sustainability of investments made with the&#13;
support of this and past Bank loans, avoiding the repetition of past mistakes, particularly&#13;
maintenance neglect. The necessary actions to achieve all these goals require sustained support to&#13;
the SEOPC and this is the origin and justification of the proposed project, preparation of which&#13;
was initiated in November 1994, with resources ofthe Loan 3350-DO. After this project, no new&#13;
Bank's loans should be necessary to finance direct investment in the highway network. Future&#13;
projects may include support for private financing of new links in the highway network,&#13;
institutional development of the future road agency and measures to improve urban transport in&#13;
major cities.&#13;
RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.4   The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented&#13;
to the Board on April 4, 1995. The CAS emphasize the importance of supporting the&#13;
Government's rehabilitation and reform program to refurbish infrastructure and foster private&#13;
sector development. The project would play an important role in removing bottlenecks to the&#13;
main engines of development growth, tourism and free trade zones. It is also in line with the&#13;
Government's strategy in the transport sector that has so far focused on reconstruction and&#13;
maintenance of key links of the highway network. Improvements in maintenance management and&#13;
consolidation of new pavement technologies introduced under the FHMRP would also be pursued.&#13;
The benefits from the rehabilitation works would be maintained in the long term by assuring a&#13;
well-executed maintenance program and setting up a dedicated organization to efficiently plan and&#13;
carry out the program. This program would be totally contracted out by the end of the project period,&#13;
under procedures and guidelines established before project effectiveness with technical assistance&#13;
provided by the ongoing project. Achieving all those objectives requires continuing Bank assistance.&#13;
Furthermore, the dialogue between the Government and the Bank during the implementation of the&#13;
two previous loans and the preparation of this project have resulted in stronger emphasis on&#13;
maintenance and institutional development, and this should also be continued.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.5   The proposed project has two broad objectives, equally important:&#13;
The first objective is to improve transport sector s contribution to the development of major&#13;
sources of growth, and improve access to markets. This will be achieved by eliminating&#13;
bottlenecks in the trunk network, continuing the reconstruction of the paved highway network&#13;
and improving safety.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
The second objective is to consolidate the gains in the institutional capacity of the SEOPC&#13;
under Loan 3350-DO to maintain the road network in a stable condition without confinual&#13;
donor support and enforce new pracftces andpolicies started under that loan. This will be&#13;
achieved by: (a) strengthening the capacity to implement maintenance programs; (b) improving&#13;
the quality of pavements using the technologies transferred under the FBIRP; (c) introducing&#13;
routine maintenance and signalization by contract and strengthening the domestic private&#13;
construction industry, (d) implementing a road fund managed by a new road agency (ONMV)&#13;
that will ensure adequate and timely release of funds to carry out maintenance programs, and&#13;
(e) strengthening budgeting, accounting and auditing procedures.&#13;
The project would also support the capacity of the Government to establish the strategy for&#13;
further development of tourist poles, private sector participation in highway financing and&#13;
urban infrastructure plans in major cities.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.6   To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project finances a program of civil works,&#13;
and a program of institutional strengthening, including the acquisition of some vehicles and office&#13;
equipment, consulting services and training. Both programs are essential to the project because a&#13;
small project on institutional strengthening would be scarcely attractive to the Borrower and&#13;
would not guarantee the completion of the programs financed under previous loans. On the&#13;
contrary, without the institutional strengthening component would be difficult to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of the gains, both physical and institutional, achieved so far. Therefore, the project&#13;
consists of the following components:&#13;
Under the program of civil works:&#13;
(a)   Civil Works&#13;
i)  Widening eisting highway sections to four divided lanes (28.3 km in total to eliminate&#13;
congestion in some highway sections with high-volume traffic (about 10,000 and more&#13;
vehicles per day) and high percentage of trucks (over 20%). The following sections will be&#13;
included in this component: Santiago-Navarrete, in the Duarte highway (20.3 km); Santo&#13;
Domingo-San Isidro, in the Mella highway (6.3 km); and Bajos de Haina-Acceso Refineria&#13;
in the Sanchez highway (1.7 km). The list and cost for these works are given in Annex 5,&#13;
Table A5.1A. The corresponding engineering designs and economic analysis have already&#13;
been completed.&#13;
ii) Construcdon of three new bridges (564m in total) and deck widening of an eing one&#13;
(102 m), where existing bridges are bottlenecks in the network. The three new bridges are&#13;
the following: a) over the Bani River (150 m), in the city of Bani, in the Sanchez highway,&#13;
b) over the Higuarno River (261 m), in the city of San Pedro de Macoris, in the east coast&#13;
highway; and c) over the Dulce River (153 m), in the city of La Romana in the east coast&#13;
highway. The deck widening corresponds to the bridge over the Yaque del Norte River&#13;
(102 m) in Montecristi. The list and cost for these bridges are given in Annex 5, Table&#13;
A5. 1B. The second and third new bridges mentioned above will be completed with new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
sections of highways to by-pass the cities La Romana (8.0 km) and San Pedro de Macoris&#13;
(12.3 kmn). The bridge in Bani will be completed with the corresponding accesses and the&#13;
improvement of the existing urban section (3.7 km in total). Preliminary engineering&#13;
designs and economic analysis have been completed. Final engineering designs are being&#13;
prepared.&#13;
iii) Reconstruction of 169 km of the highway network. The list of the highways included is&#13;
given in Annex 5, Table A5. IC. The SEOPC will annually review the list with the Bank&#13;
and any modification or addition will be done only after obtaining the Bank's approval. The&#13;
corresponding engineering designs and economic analysis have been completed.&#13;
iv) A program of highway resurfacing that includes 628 km of highways to be resurfaced&#13;
using new pavement technologies implemented under loan 3350-DO. The list of the&#13;
highways included is given in Annex 5, Table A5.2. The SEOPC will annually review the&#13;
list with the Bank and any modification or addition will be done only after obtaining the&#13;
Bank's approval.&#13;
v) A pilotprogram of routine maintenance by contract on 640 km (13% of the network)&#13;
(Annex 5, Table A5.3) selected from the maintenance programs for 1997-2000 detailed in&#13;
Annex 3. Routine maintenance of the rest of the network will be contracted out by year&#13;
2001 (para. 1.30). The programs have been agreed with the Borrower during negotiations.&#13;
Agreement was also reached that, by September of each year, the SEOPC will update,&#13;
satisfactorily to the Bank, the maintenance programs, list of highways in the pilot program&#13;
and budget for highway maintenance for the next fiscal year, and by March 31 of each year,&#13;
will report to the Bank the actual budget, by category of expenditure, spent for&#13;
maintenance in the preceding fiscal year&#13;
vi) A road signalization program by contract (see details in Annex 5, Table A5.4) that&#13;
includes informative signals for connection among roads, itineraries for some destinations,&#13;
tourist locations and road services provided to the users. At present, this type of&#13;
information is almost nonexistent.&#13;
(b) Civil Work Supervision and Technical Auditing&#13;
vii) Supervision of civil works, including technical auditing for widening, reconstruction&#13;
and rehabilitation of highways and construction of bridges financed by the project. These&#13;
tasks will be carried out by independent consultants funded by the project to provide&#13;
quality control and ensure compliance with bid specifications. The highway resurfacing,&#13;
routine maintenance and signalization programs will be supervised by the DGCCV staff&#13;
trained under technical assistance financed by the loan 3350-DO. (Terms of reference for&#13;
supervision are included in Annex 6.1, and for technical audits in Annex 10).&#13;
Under the program of institutional strengthening:&#13;
(c) Acquisition of Goods&#13;
viii) Acquisition of vehicles, spare parts and office equipment. Acquisition of all terrain&#13;
vehicles to facilitate design and supervision of the highway resurfacing and maintenance&#13;
programs; spare parts for operation of the existing maintenance equipment; all terrain&#13;
vehicles and office equipment (desk-top computers, printers and photocopy machines).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
(d)   Consulting Services and Training&#13;
ix) Consulting servicesfor a technical assistanceprogram consisting of:&#13;
(a) coordination of project implementation (para. 3.1); (b) assistance in the use of&#13;
maintenance systems, in the preparation and monitoring of maintenance contracts, and in&#13;
implementing a road fund to be managed by a road agency (Annex 6.2); (c) advise and&#13;
training in financial management and intemal performance audits (Annex 6.3); (d)&#13;
strengthen the environmental unit of the SEOPC (Annex 6.4); (e) establishing a data base&#13;
on highway accident statistics (Annex 6.5); f) preparation of future investment programs&#13;
in the transport sector (Annex 6.6); (g) preparation of a development plan of the&#13;
northwestem region, including feasibility and environmental impact studies and&#13;
preliminary engineering design of basic infrastructure; (h) preparation of a highway&#13;
development plan for the eastern coastal region; (i) preparation of a drainage and&#13;
sanitation plan in the city of Santo Domingo to complement the urban transport study&#13;
financed by the 3350-DO loan (Annex 6.7); and (j) preparation of a feasibility study of the&#13;
widening to four lanes and subsequent maintenance for concession of the Santo Domingo-&#13;
San Crist6bal-Bani highway (Annex 6.8).&#13;
ENVIRONmENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
2.7    Most physical improvements under the project consist of the rehabilitation or&#13;
reconstruction of existing facilities and, therefore, direct environmental impacts on natural systems&#13;
and right-of-ways will be of less importance. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study&#13;
was carried out by a group of national and international consultants, financed under Loan 3350-&#13;
DO. The final EIA report was delivered before appraisal. A summary of the EIA is included in&#13;
Annex 7. The main conclusions of the study are: (i) the proposed works will have little to&#13;
moderate environmental impacts. All possible impacts have been identified and appropriate&#13;
mitigation measures have been proposed and incorporated in project design; all measures in turn&#13;
will be included in all bidding documents and construction contracts as well as supervision&#13;
activities. A summary matrix of environrnental impacts and mitigation measures for each sub-&#13;
project is presented in Attachments to Annex 7; and (ii) no significant resettlement would be&#13;
required under the project. As a result, the project has been environmentally rated "B". Finally,&#13;
an Environmental Manual for Road Design and Construction (Project File) has been prepared and&#13;
will be adopted by SEOPC before project effectiveness. The purpose of this manual is to establish&#13;
specific rules for minimizing environmental damage during the construction and rehabilitation of&#13;
roads. Nevertheless:&#13;
(a)   in the event that population resettlement is needed to carry out any subproject, the&#13;
Borrower shall not later than the date in which it furnishes to the Bank the&#13;
corresponding Highway Investment and Maintenance Program in which such&#13;
subproject is included: (i) prepare and furnish to the Bank a resettlement plan for&#13;
such population satisfactory to the Bank; and (ii) thereafter carry out such plan in&#13;
accordance with its terms;&#13;
(b)   in the event that the final engineering designs of a subproject require acquisition of&#13;
land therefor, the Borrower shall not later than the date in which it furnishes to the&#13;
Bank the corresponding Highway Investment and Maintenance Program in which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
such subproject is included: (a) prepare and furnish to the Bank, a land acquisition&#13;
plan, satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) thereafter carry out such plan in accordance&#13;
with its terms.&#13;
PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
2.8   The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$122.5 million&#13;
equivalent. Of this amount, US$75 million (61.2%), would be financed by the Bank. The Nordic&#13;
Development Fund (NDF) has shown interest in financing the consulting services (e) to (h) in&#13;
para. 2.6 (d) above, at a cost of, US$3.0 million, or 2.5% of the total project cost. A final&#13;
decision by the NDF is expected in March 1997. The remaining US$44.5 million (36.3%), an&#13;
average of US$11.1 million per year, would be financed by the Government. The loan will&#13;
finance the foreign exchange component for civil works, equipment and the institutional&#13;
strengthening program. If the NDF does not finally cofinance the project, the corresponding&#13;
subcomponents would be financed with funds from the unallocated category, if they are available.&#13;
Those subcomponents although linked to the project objectives are not essential to them. Table&#13;
2.1 summarizes the project cots and the loan financing plan.&#13;
2.9   Project cost estimates are based on: (a) final engineering for the civil works included in the&#13;
highway rehabilitation, widening and resurfacing programs; (b) preliminary engineering and cost&#13;
estimates (obtained from the up-dated costs of past similar works) for the new highway and&#13;
bridges and the signalization program; (c) published suppliers' prices for vehicles, spare parts and&#13;
office equipment; and, (d) prevailing fees for consulting services. The costing was done in foreign&#13;
currency equivalent, so any realignment of the exchange rate will not affect the total project cost&#13;
in dollars.&#13;
2.10  Provision for physical contingencies has been adopted at a rate of 10% of the base price&#13;
for highway construction, widening, rehabilitation and resurfacing and for bridge construction.&#13;
Physical contingencies are estimated at US$ 8.3 million. Provision for price escalation is based&#13;
on Bank projections of price index variations for road and bridge-related manufactured goods.&#13;
The rate used is 3% for the period 1997-2001. Price contingencies total US$11.0 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
2.11 During negotiations an agreement was reached that the Government will earmark the&#13;
project counterpart funds in its investment plan for the period 1997-2001 (calendar years,&#13;
Borrower's fiscal years) as follows: 1997 - US$9.0 million; 1998 - US$9.5 million; 1999 -&#13;
US$9.5 million; 2000 - US$9.5 million and, 2001 - US$7.0 million.&#13;
2.12  Furthermore, it is necessary to ensure that, starting in 2000, the maintenance budgets will&#13;
be totally funded without external financing. For this purpose, the Borrower, by December 31,&#13;
1998, will prepare and initiate action for the adoption of the instruments necessary to establish the&#13;
Road Fund and the new road agency (ONMV). Furthermore, at the time of the project mid-term&#13;
review or earlier, the Road Fund and the new road agency (ONMV) will be substantially&#13;
operating (see paras. 1.36, 1.37, and 1.38). Adequate remedies are provided in the Loan&#13;
Agreement, in case the Fund and the Agency are not operative at that time.&#13;

EcoNoMIc EVALUATION&#13;
2.13   An economic analysis was performed during project preparation for most of the physical&#13;
components of the project, namely the widening of 28.3 km, the construction of four bridges&#13;
ong with 20.3 km of bypasses of cities, the deck widening of an existing bridge, the&#13;
construction of about 169 km of higlhways, and a highway resurfacing program of 628 km of&#13;
primary roads. These activities comprise 80% of the total base project cost. The economic&#13;
evaluation of these components shows a combined economic internal rate of return of 24.5&#13;
US$4.0 million financed 80% by IBRD's funds and 20% by the Dominican Government.&#13;
US$2.8 million financed 100% by the Nordic Fund.&#13;

* For those components already evaluated&#13;
2.14   The economic analysis of the highway-widening component was undertaken with the&#13;
application of the new version of the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (1995&#13;
HDM System), which incorporates capacity constraints into the analysis of rehabilitation&#13;
strategies. The three roads under consideration--Santiago-Navarrete, Bajos de Haina-Refineria,&#13;
and Santo Domingo-San Isidro--present average daily traffics of 9, 000 to 16,500 vehicles. The&#13;
roads are already congested and would become more so if no expansion of the capacity of the&#13;
roads is undertaken, severely increasing vehicle operating costs and time-related costs. In the&#13;
economic analysis, normal traffic is assumed to grow at a conservative annual rate of around 3&#13;
percent; for the widening alternative, it has assumed an additional generated traffic of 10 percent.&#13;
The value of time for those traveling on private cars is estimated to be 9.0 RD$ per hour,&#13;
representing 50 percent of the prorated value of a mix of passengers consisting of: (a) 70 percent,&#13;
low income (6.7 RD$ per hour, the minimum wage); (b) 20 percent, middle income (33.3 RD$&#13;
per hour); and (c) 10 percent, high income (66.6 RD$ per hour). For those traveling on buses,&#13;
the value of time is assumed to be 2.0 RD$ per hour, representing a conservative assumption of&#13;
30 percent of the minimum wage. The estimated costs and EIRRs for the corresponding sub-&#13;
components are included in Tables A8.1 and A8.3 of Annex 8, and all of them are 18% and&#13;
above.&#13;
2.15   Sensitivity analyses performed for each of the three sub-projects of the highway widening&#13;
component, to test variations in the EIRRs show (Annex 8) that the EIRRs remain above 15&#13;
percent in the event that costs increase by 20 percent or the benefits decrease by 20 percent.&#13;
2.16   The bridge construction program comprises the construction of three new bridges, the&#13;
deck widening of an existing one and two new bypasses of cities. Currently, one of the three&#13;
bridges (Higuamo river) to be replaced is in danger of collapsing and in all instances of bypasses&#13;
the roads transverse congested urban areas. The benefits from this program are associated with&#13;
savings in vehicle operating costs and in travel time for the users who select to use the new roads,&#13;
considering the same value in time than in the case of the highway widening component. The&#13;
economic analysis of the bridge reconstruction program also incorporates benefits that would&#13;
accrue from the reduction of future bridge maintenance costs and the additional costs associated&#13;
with the maintenance of the new bypasses, but it does not include the benefits to the users who&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
select to continue to use the existing roads. The three new bridges--Higuamo, Bani, and Dulce--&#13;
are on heavily trafficked highways, with average daily traffic over 2000 vehicles per day. The&#13;
fourth bridge involves only deck widening and it is on a road with a medium traffic volume of&#13;
800 vehicles per day. The construction of the bridges and the corresponding bypasses would&#13;
divert long distance traffic from existing highways. The diversion rate is estimated to vary&#13;
between 35 and 50 percent, depending on the difference between the generalized value of travel&#13;
cost across the existing and the proposed roads. Normal traffic is expected to grow at an average&#13;
annual rate of 3 around percent. Traffic generation was considered in the analysis, existing traffic&#13;
will probably increase by 10 to 25 percent, as a consequence of the faster speed and reduced&#13;
travel times brought about by the construction of the bridges and bypasses, adding to the&#13;
calculated benefits. The likely air pollution and accident reduction benefits, particularly associated&#13;
with traffic reduction in urban areas, have not been incorporated into the analysis. Based on these&#13;
conservative assumptions, the economic analysis yields EIRRs exceeding 15 % for all the&#13;
proposed bridges and bypasses. The estimated costs and EIRRs for the corresponding sub-&#13;
components are included in Table A8.6 of Annex 8.&#13;
2.17  Sensitivity analyses were performed for each of the bridges and bypasses and for the deck&#13;
widening of the existing bridge to test variations in the EIRRs in the event that costs increase by&#13;
20 percent or the benefits decrease by 15 percent. Under these assumptions, all the EIRR for the&#13;
bridges/bypasses are above the 12% benchmark (Annex 8). Nevertheless, an agreement would&#13;
be sought at negotiations that, prior undertaking any investment, the Bank's approval will be&#13;
sought if final engineering for any road link results in cost estimates exceeding the original&#13;
estimate by more than 25 percent in dollar terms.&#13;
2.18  The economic analysis of the highway reconstruction/rehabilitation components was&#13;
carried out using the HDM. The economic analysis is based on comparing the costs and benefits&#13;
of the proposed solution with the base case of only undertaking routine maintenance on the&#13;
existing road and with other alternative rehabilitation strategies. Benefits only include those&#13;
accrued to normal traffic as a consequence of savings in vehicle operating costs; this traffic is&#13;
estimated to grow at an average annual rate of around 3 percent during the 20 years of the&#13;
analysis period. The proposed solution varies from one road to another, depending on the current&#13;
conditions of the road; it normally includes a combination of 100 percent patching, resealing of 5&#13;
mm every five years, and overlays of 40 mm every ten years. The estimated cost and ERRS for&#13;
each road link are included in Table A8.7 of Annex 8. The EIRRs vary from 14.1 percent to over&#13;
82.4%. The weighted EIRRis 21.1%&#13;
2.19  The highway resurfacing component was also analyzed using the HDM under similar&#13;
assumptions than those for the highway reconstruction component. The estimated cost and&#13;
EIRRs for each road link are included in Table A8.8 of Annex 8. As the table demonstrates, the&#13;
EIRRs vary from 13.1 % to over 150%. The weighted EIRR is 36.6%.&#13;
2.20  Sensitivity analyses were performed for all the sub-projects in the reconstruction and&#13;
resurfacing programs to test variations in the EIRRs in the event that costs increase by 10 percent&#13;
or the benefits decrease by 10 percent. In both situations the EIRRs remained above the 12&#13;
percent benchmark. In the event that costs increase by 20 percent or the benefits decrease by 20&#13;
percent the EIRR for the reconstruction of the road Boronga-Boya-Dofia Maria falls to 11.5%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
and the EIRR for the reconstruction of the road Esperanza-Mao falls to 11.2%. These results are&#13;
acceptable and, therefore, the two links have been retained in the highway reconstruction&#13;
program. Nevertheless, an agreement would be sought at negotiations that, before undertaking&#13;
any investment, the Bank's approval will be sought if final engineering for any road link results in&#13;
cost estimates exceeding the original estimate by more than 25 percent in dollar termns.&#13;
2.21  An analysis performed to test the effects (risks) of postponing the widening and&#13;
reconstruction investments show that for all projects the net benefits are reduced if investments&#13;
are postponed by one or two years. However, the analysis shows that it would not affect the&#13;
economic worthiness of the sub-projects (see Annex 8, para. 14).&#13;
2.22  An analysis performed to test the effects (risks) of not implementing an optimal&#13;
maintenance policy, after completion of the various rehabilitation and widening works, shows that&#13;
benefits will decrease slightly if a proper maintenance program (including routine maintenance,&#13;
patching and resealing) were not timely implemented. If only a limited routine maintenance is&#13;
applied, the analysis shows that the NPV of sub-projects would decrease on average by 9 percent,&#13;
though the economic rate of return remains greater than 12 percent for all sub-projects. The&#13;
results reflect economic benefits for the proposed sub-projects that are sustained even in light of&#13;
sub-optimal maintenance policies (see Annex 8, para. 15).&#13;
2.23  The above analyses underestimate the true economic benefits of the highway programs&#13;
because they do not fully quantify the additional benefits to be derived from the environmental&#13;
benefits from smoother vehicle operation and the avoidance of congested traffic conditions with&#13;
frequent stop-and-go situations.&#13;
PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
2.24  Implementation of this project will ensure adequate financing and timely release of funds&#13;
in the future for maintaining the highway network in a stable condition without continual donor&#13;
support. In this respect, at the time of project midterm review, a road fund to be managed by a&#13;
new road agency (ONMV) will have been implemented. The project will also strengthen the&#13;
SEOPC's capacity to carry out road maintenance in an efficient manner, and improve management&#13;
procedures and techniques, among them contracting out of all programmable maintenance and&#13;
using new pavement technologies. Finally, the highway improvements included in the project will&#13;
help reduce the rehabilitation and maintenance work to a level where the needs can be managed&#13;
within a steady budgetary framework.&#13;
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.1   Operational Set-Up. The project should be completed in about four years, from mid-&#13;
1997 to mid-2001. SEOPC will act as the executing agency. General administrative coordination&#13;
and relations with the Bank will be provided by the Project Coordinator assisted by a Project&#13;
Coordinating Team (PCT), to be financed by the proposed project, and with the cooperation of&#13;
DARE, (which was established under previous Bank loans and reports directly to the Secretary of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Public Works), the four General Directorates (DGC, DGM, DGSFO and DGPP), DRS and&#13;
DCCT. The composition and functions of the PCT are shown in Annex 9. The establishment of&#13;
the PCT and the employment of the Project Coordinating Team will be a condition of project&#13;
effectiveness. The project will finance five local consultants of the PCT: the team head and four&#13;
professionals, in addition to the consulting services also financed by the project. The remaining&#13;
staff and operating costs, including administration office and general running costs will be&#13;
financed by the SEOPC. The staff of the PCT could be incorporated, at the end of project&#13;
implementation, into the new road agency (ONMV) to be implemented under the project (see&#13;
para. 1.38). Furthermore, not later than December 31, 1997, the SEOPC employ and thereafter&#13;
retain until completion of the project a transport specialist (with qualifications and experience&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank) to assist the SEOPC in the preparation of transport programs.&#13;
3.2   All civil works financed by the project will be carried out by contract. To expedite project&#13;
execution, civil works contracts for highway rehabilitation and resurfacing should be packaged,&#13;
wherever possible, according to their geographical location, to facilitate contractors' logistic&#13;
support activities, or the year to be tendered.&#13;
3.3   To ensure adequate quality of civil works, they will be supervised by engineering&#13;
consultants funded under the project. The consultants will ensure compliance with design&#13;
specifications and report any delay in execution as well as propose on-site solutions in case of&#13;
unforeseen difficulties. They will submit quarterly progress reports to the SEOPC on the progress&#13;
of each contract. The supervision provided by consultants will be monitored by the PCT and the&#13;
counterparts in the DGSFO and will be subject to periodical technical audits (paras. 1.29 and 3.7).&#13;
3.4   Overall responsibility for carrying out the road maintenance component will be vested with&#13;
the DGM. It will supervise the pilot program of routine maintenance by contract as well as the&#13;
program of highway resurfacing, assisted by the PCT and the Pavement Department. The&#13;
program of highway resurfacing will be carried out by local contractors trained under the&#13;
pavement technology transfer program financed by Loan 3350-DO. The pilot program of routine&#13;
maintenance will be carried out by small contractors under terms and guidelines to be completed,&#13;
by the SEOPC assisted by consultants financed by Loan 3350-DO. The SEOPC will prepare and&#13;
furnish to the Bank those guidelines by March 31, 1997.&#13;
3.5   Acquisition of vehicles and spare parts will be controlled by the DGM, which is&#13;
responsible for the vehicle fleet. Acquisition of office equipment will be controlled by the PCT.&#13;
3.6   The responsibility for consultant services will be as follows:&#13;
(i)   project coordination team - Project Coordinator&#13;
(ii)   maintenance management, contracting and financing - DGM&#13;
(iii)  administrative and financing - DARE&#13;
(iv)   strengthening environmental capability - DCCT&#13;
(v)   highway accident data bank - DGPP&#13;
(vi)  future transport programs - DGPP&#13;
(vii)  development plan for the northwestern region - DGPP and a steering commnittee&#13;
(viii)  highway development plan for the eastern coastal region - DGPP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
(ix)   drainage and sanitation plan in Santo Domingo - a steering committee with&#13;
participation of city council representatives.&#13;
(x)   feasibility study of the widening of the San Cristobal-Bani highway - DGPP&#13;
MONiTORiNG, REPORTING AND BANK SuPERVISION&#13;
3.7   Monitoring. The monitoring of project implementation will encompass two levels. One&#13;
will consist of project performance reviews to be undertaken by the PCT on a continuous basis.&#13;
The other will consist of an annual engineering (technical) audit (para. 1.29) to be carried out by&#13;
an engineering consulting firm. Annex 10 provides details regarding the selection of the firm,&#13;
working standards, scheduling of the reports, concurrence of the technical audit report with the&#13;
financial-administrative audit report, the scope of the audit and recommended size of the audit&#13;
sample. The technical audit will be performed in accordance with generally and internationally&#13;
accepted road engineering standards and the professional audit standards adapted to technical&#13;
examinations. The Appendix to Annex 10 provides a set of the latter standards.&#13;
3.8   Reporting. The SEOPC will submit to the Bank quarterly reports of engineering and&#13;
financial-administrative nature on the project components providing, on the technical&#13;
components: (i) updated list of "eligible sub-projects", (ii) information on progress achieved&#13;
against agreed "performance monitoring indicators" and disbursement schedules; (iii) information&#13;
on progress of the maintenance programs; (iv) the effects of the project on the environment&#13;
during the period reported; (v) status of compliance with the legal covenants in the Loan&#13;
Agreement; and (vi) detailed work program and action plan for the coming two quarters; and on&#13;
the financial-administrative components: (i) counterpart funds allocated to the project in the&#13;
fiscal years vs. the amount actually spent; (ii) status of compliance with the legal (financial-&#13;
administrative) covenants in the Loan Agreement; and (iii) updated implementation and&#13;
disbursement schedules for the remainder of the project. The independent examination of these&#13;
quarterly reports will be included in the terms of reference of both the financial-administrative-&#13;
compliance audit and the engineering audit. The format and contents of the progress reports,&#13;
including key monitoring performance indicators were confirmed at negotiations. The proposed&#13;
monitoring performance indicators are included in Annex 11. They will allow to monitor the use&#13;
of project resources (input indicators), the timely delivering of the expected goods and services&#13;
provided by the project (output indicators) and the degree to which the project objectives are&#13;
being achieved (outcome and impact indicators). Finally, the SEOPC will submit to the Bank a&#13;
project implementation completion report by June 30, 2002 or six months after the loan is closed.&#13;
3.9   Annual Reviews. To monitor progress towards the civil works and the institutional&#13;
development objectives of the project effectively, it was agreed at negotiations that at yearly&#13;
intervals, starting not later than six months after loan effectiveness, the Government will meet&#13;
with representatives of the Bank to review and discuss: (i) progress in carrying out the civil&#13;
works, including revisions found to be necessary; (ii) physical progress of the maintenance plan&#13;
for the year, actual road maintenance expenditures for the year and proposed annual highway&#13;
maintenance program and budget for the following year; (iii) performance of the PCT; (iv)&#13;
progress on technical assistance and training; (v) the results of environmental monitoring carried&#13;
out by the DCCT; and (vi) audit reports. The project will be monitored against the technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
audits (paras 1.29 and 3.7 and Annex 10), key performance indicators (Annex 11), project&#13;
implementation schedule (Annex 12), estimated schedule of disbursements (Table 3.4) and the&#13;
action program for institutional development in Table 3.1.&#13;

31, 1999 will be a formal mid-term review and provide an opportunity for a more comprehensive&#13;
assessment of the achievements of the project to date, and of the prospects for successful project&#13;
completion. The review will be carried out according to the agenda and terms of reference&#13;
submitted by the Government and agreed with the Bank not later than June 30, 1999. At&#13;
negotiations, it was agreed with the Government that the review will cover: physical progress of&#13;
the project; execution of the institutional strengthening program; implementation of the road&#13;
maintenance plan; and compliance with the action program above.&#13;
3.11   Project Supervision. The project will be supervised according to the Supervision&#13;
Strategy, included in Annex 13, built on the experience gained during the implementation of&#13;
previous projects and the preparation of this project.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.12 Procurement of works and goods financed with Bank funds will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January&#13;
1995," revised in January and August 1996. All procurement arrangements were confirmed at&#13;
negotiations to ensure that they are in compliance with these guidelines. Civil works (including&#13;
supervision) are estimated to account for about 91.6% of total project costs, acquisition of goods&#13;
about 2.2% and consulting services (other than work supervision) about 6.2%. Table 3.2 shows&#13;

3.13   Civil Works. All contracts for highway construction and rehabilitation, and bridge&#13;
construction to be financed by the Bank and expected to be valued at more than US$3 million and&#13;
the contract for road signalization will be procured on the basis of ICB procedures and in&#13;
accordance with the "Bank Standard Documents for Procurement of Works (Smaller Contracts),&#13;
January 1995".&#13;
3.14 Civil works for highway resurfacing and routine maintenance for contract between US$3&#13;
million and 250,000 will be awarded under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) which will be&#13;
based on standard bidding documents to be approved by the Bank (national competitive bidding&#13;

international bidders).&#13;
3.15  Routine maintenance works estimated to cost less than US$250,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract will be procured on the basis of price quotations obtained from three qualified local&#13;
contractors (with experience and resources to successfully complete the contract) in response to a&#13;
written invitation. The invitation will include a detailed description of the works, including basic&#13;
specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank&#13;
and relevant drawings when necessary. The award will be made to the contractor who offers the&#13;
lower price quotation for the required work.&#13;
3.16 Civil works of US$ 10 million and more will be procured on the basis of ICB procedures in&#13;
accordance with "Bank Standard Documents for Procurement of Works (Major Works), January&#13;
1995". Prequalification of civil works contractors for contracts of US$10 million and more is&#13;
essential to the bidding process and will be based on "Prequalification Procurement of Works, April&#13;
1993 and Bidding Documents Procurement of Works, January 1995" and defined in terms of&#13;
minimum working capital, professional experience, volume and scope of similar works. All&#13;
contractors (foreign and local) interested in being prequalified will be evaluated on the basis of "fail&#13;
or pass evaluation criteria"; that is, only those complying with the minimum criteria will be&#13;
qualified.&#13;
3.17 Goods. Vehicles, spare parts and office equipment will be purchased in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's "Standard Bidding Documents. Procurement of Goods, The World Bank, January&#13;
1995." Goods estimated to cost less than US$250,000 per contract may be awarded through&#13;
NCB, using standard bidding documents acceptable to the Bank, except for items costing less&#13;
than US$50,000, which could be purchased using national or international shopping.&#13;
3.18  Consulting Services. Consultants for civil work supervision, technical assistance, training&#13;
programs, and auditing services will be selected and engaged following the "Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency,&#13;
August 1981" using the Bank's "Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services for Time-&#13;
based Complex Assignments and for Lump Sum Remuneration, June 1995."&#13;
3.19 Procurement Review. The Bank will review ex-ante all procurement documentation&#13;
(advertising, bidding documents, bid evaluation and contract award) under ICB as well as the first&#13;
two contracts in each year under NCB. The documents for the remaining contracts under NBC&#13;
will be subject to ex-post review by the Bank. All other procurement documentation will be&#13;
retained by the SEOPC and subject to selective ex-post review by the Bank's supervision&#13;
missions. The provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank review or approval of&#13;
budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitations, proposals, evaluation reports and&#13;
contracts shall not apply to: (a) contracts for the employment of consulting firms estimated to cost&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent or less each; or (b) contracts for the employment of individual consultants&#13;
estimated to cost $50,000 equivalent or less each. However, this exemption to prior Bank review&#13;
will not apply to: (a) terms of reference for such contracts; (b) single source selection of firms; (c)&#13;
assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank; (d) amendments to&#13;
contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to $100,000 equivalent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
or more; or (e) amendments to contracts for the employment of individual consultants raising the&#13;
contract value to $50,000 equivalent or more. Under these procedures, Bank's prior review will&#13;
cover about 80% of the total contract values.&#13;
3.20 Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing. The loan could finance&#13;
retroactively expenditures incurred, inter alia, under the highway resurfacing program and the&#13;
pilot program of routine maintenance by contract as well as for technical assistance to support&#13;
the implementation of those programs. The implementation of those components would be done&#13;
in consultation with the Bank, including a review by the Bank of all procurement actions.&#13;
DISBURSEMENTS, AccOUNTING AND AUDITS&#13;
3.21   Disbursements. Disbursements will be made against the following categories of eligible&#13;
expenditures: (a) 70% of total expenditures for civil works of highway widening and bridge and&#13;
bypass construction and for road signalization by contract; (b) 60% of total expenditures for&#13;
highway reconstruction or rehabilitation; (c) 50% of total expenditures for the program of&#13;
highway resurfacing with new technologies and for the pilot program of routine maintenance by&#13;
contract; (d) 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and&#13;
90% of other items procured locally for purchase of vehicles, spare parts and office equipment;&#13;
(e) 60% of total expenditures for civil work supervision and technical audits; and, (f) 80% of the&#13;
cost for consulting services, including the costs of counterpart staff. Table 3.3 shows the basis of&#13;
loan disbursements.&#13;

3.22 The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 3.4. The Government's aim is&#13;
to substantially complete the project by mid-2001, and the implementation schedule has been&#13;
developed on this basis. Experience shows, however, that some slippage is likely. The FHRMP,&#13;
Loan 3350-DO, will take four years to disburse compared to the three years originally estimated.&#13;
Therefore, the estimated disbursement profile adopted extends disbursements through 2001. The&#13;
project closing date is December 31, 2001.&#13;

Loan signing date:    Jan. 15, 97  Loan effectiveness: Apr. 15, 97&#13;
Project completion:   Jun. 15, 01  Loan closing date: Dec. 31, 01&#13;
"Includes initial deposit to Special Account and retroactive fmnancing.&#13;
3.23   Special Account and Local Project Account. A Special Account will be opened and&#13;
maintained in US dollars in the Central Bank with an initial deposit of US$3 million rising to&#13;
US$5 million after withdrawals and commitments reach US$12 million. The Bank will replenish&#13;
the Special Account upon receipt of disbursement requests from the Borrower. DARE, with the&#13;
assistance of the PCT, will control the use of the Special Account and be responsible for&#13;
preparing the disbursement requests on behalf of the Borrower. These requests should be&#13;
submitted every month, or when the Special Account has been drawn to 35% of its initial deposit,&#13;
whichever comes first. In addition, not later than thirty days after the Effective Date, the&#13;
Borrower will open and thereafter maintain until completion of the project a deposit account in&#13;
Dominican pesos, for purposes of managing the counterpart funds, and make an initial deposit&#13;
equivalent to US$1.5 million or about four months of local contribution. The operating&#13;
arrangements for the Special Account and the Local Account were agreed at negotiations and are&#13;
reflected in the Agreed Minutes of Negotiations, signed with the Borrower.&#13;
3.24   Statement of Expenditures and Retroactive Financing. Disbursement requests in&#13;
respect of civil work contracts over US$3.0 million, acquisition of goods over US$250,000 and&#13;
consultant contracts over US$100,000 and US$50,000 respectively (para. 3.19) will be fully&#13;
documented. In all other cases, disbursements will be made against statements of expenditure&#13;
(SOEs). All SOEs will be transmitted through DARE, which will retain the supporting&#13;
documentation in separate files for each SOE and make it available for examination by Bank staff&#13;
during supervision missions (Annex 13). During project preparation, it was confirmed that there&#13;
are sufficient and qualified staff in DARE to record, handle and report on the SOE related&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
transactions. Retroactive financing is recommended for payments made under the project after&#13;
February 15, 1996, but before the date of loan signature, up to a total of US$6.0 million to&#13;
finance, inter alia, the highway resurfacing program, the pilot program of routine maintenance by&#13;
contract, and technical assistance to the DGM and DARE (para. 3.20). The amount to be&#13;
financed retroactively with loan proceeds was confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
3.25 Accounting. The Borrower will have accounting and control systems capable of reliably&#13;
recording and reporting all financial transactions. To this effect, the appraisal mission evaluated&#13;
the accounting and financial system in force at DARE and discussed the new accounting system in&#13;
implementation by independent consultants financed by the IDB. The new financial management&#13;
system (accounting and reporting system) will be fully operative before project effectiveness and&#13;
will cover the following aspects: i) system of budgeting and accounting, including accounting&#13;
standards used; ii) internal control system and procedures; iii) flow of funds to support the project&#13;
organization and the project (including Bank funds); iv) financial reporting arrangements,&#13;
including linkages to key performance indicators; and v) auditing arrangements. This review will&#13;
be followed by specific recommendations to guarantee that the designs of the financial&#13;
management and accounting structure directly related to the proposed project, including staffing,&#13;
is satisfactory.&#13;
3.26  Audits. All records relating to project expenditures will be kept by the project&#13;
administration unit within DARE. Based on previous experience, the appraisal mission fully&#13;
documented the accounting staff of DARE and the external auditors on the scope and meaning of&#13;
the Bank's audit standards and financial information requirements. The scope and content of the&#13;
following audit reports were extensively discussed: Statement of Sources and Application of&#13;
Funds and Investments in the project; Supplementary Financial Information on the project; the&#13;
Statements of Expenditures --SOEs; the Special Account; the evaluation of the internal control&#13;
environment, and management's integrity and underlying ethical values; the "compliance opinions"&#13;
and the "management letter". This scope and content is shown in Annex 14 jointly with&#13;
instructions regarding the selection of the firm, working standards, scheduling of reports,&#13;
concurrence of the reports, guidelines for the preparation of the Audit service contract and terms&#13;
of reference for the preparation of the audit. Certified copies of the audit reports will be furnished&#13;
to the Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal year. The audit report will include a&#13;
separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against certified SOEs. The amount for&#13;
retroactive financing would be included in the annual audit of the fiscal year when the loan&#13;
agreement is signed. In addition to the "financial-administrative-compliance audit", an annual&#13;
"engineering audit" (technical audit) has been provided as detailed in paragraphs 1.29 and 3.7.&#13;
PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
3.27 The improvement of the highway network (Table 3.5) and the elimination of the main&#13;
existing bottlenecks will reduce congestion, accidents and vehicle operating costs, thereby&#13;
creating incentives for tourism promotion and increased production, and reducing outlays of&#13;
scarce foreign exchange. However, the benefits from this improvement will not be maintained in&#13;
the long term without assuring a well executed maintenance program for the highway network&#13;
and the setting up of an efficient organization to plan and carry out this maintenance program; this&#13;
will be a major contribution of Bank's participation in the proposed project. The necessary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
changes in reorganization of the work force; the methodologies introduced under Loan 3350-DO&#13;
in maintenance management; the introduction of routine maintenance by contract; and, the&#13;
consolidation of the use of new technologies in road resurfacing, also introduced under the same&#13;
loan, will be implemented only with Bank involvement and close supervision.&#13;

Network                               PROJECT RISKS&#13;
(1995-2001)&#13;
3.28  The main risks are: (a) delays&#13;
Paved Network    3831  100%   4240            in the widening and reconstruction&#13;
Good Condition   3110   81%   4240 100%       investments. To minimize this risk,&#13;

Good Condition   3477   690/o  4607  89%      completed and the Government will&#13;
Poor Condition   1576   31%    560  11%       establish a Local Account with an&#13;
initial deposit equivalent to US$ 1.5&#13;
million to cover about four months of local contribution (see para. 3.23); (b) inadequate&#13;
maintenance execution. To minimize this risk, the project will finance a program of highway&#13;
resurfacing and a pilot program of routine maintenance, both to be contracted out; in addition, the&#13;
SEOPC maintenance organization will be strengthened; (c) insufficient maintenance financing&#13;
after the project. To minimize this risk, SEOPC will establish a Road Fund for road and bridge&#13;
maintenance. Risks (a), (b), and (c) have been analyzed to quantify the impacts on the economic&#13;
worthiness of subprojects (see paras. 2.21 and 2.22 and Annex 8). They result in a reduction of&#13;
the benefits of the project but, even under those circumstances, all sub-projects show positive&#13;
NPVs; (d) the proposed Road Fund is not implemented before project completion. This risk is&#13;
manageable, because risks associated with failure to establish the fund do not threaten project&#13;
implementation directly as the financing of the project does not require the proceeds from the&#13;
Road Fund. Nevertheless, the Fund will help achieve the sustainability of the projects objectives&#13;
and its concept and rationale have already taken hold among SEOPC's management. The SEOPC&#13;
will adopt the instruments necessary to establish the Fund by December 31, 1998 (see para. 2.12&#13;
and Table 3.1); (e) high staff turnover, motivated by the low salaries paid by the SEOPC or&#13;
political events. To prevent high staff turnover, as a transitory arrangement until the new road&#13;
agency (ONMV) is established, the SEOPC will establish a Project Coordinating Team and&#13;
continue to allow its skilled staff to take outside employment after working hours as a supplement&#13;
to their salaries. With respect to political changes, since 1988 there have been no substantial&#13;
turnovers and after the elections held in May 1994 and 1996 only the staff politically involved has&#13;
been removed.&#13;

such population satisfactory to the Bank; and (ii) thereafter carry out such plan in&#13;
accordance with its terms (para. 2.7.a);&#13;
(d)   in the event that the final engineering designs of a subproject require acquisition of&#13;
land therefor, the Borrower not later than the date in which it furnishes to the&#13;
Bank the corresponding Highway Investment and Maintenance Program in which&#13;

December 31, 1998 (para. 2.12);&#13;
(f)   the SEOPC will consult with the Bank before contracting any work under the&#13;
project if final and original designs of subprojects resulted in cost estimates&#13;
exceeding those of the preliminary engineering designs by more than 25% in US&#13;
dollar equivalent (paras. 2.17 and 2.20);&#13;
(g)   the SEOPC will employ and thereafter retain, until completion of the project, a&#13;
transport specialist (with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank) to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32 -&#13;
assist the SEOPC in the preparation of transport programs, not later than&#13;
December 31, 1997 (para. 3.1);&#13;
(h)   the SEOPC will prepare and furnish to the Bank by March 31, 1997, with the&#13;
assistance of consultants, terms and guidelines acceptable to the Bank to carry out&#13;
the program of routine maintenance by contract (para. 3.4);&#13;
(i)   not later than thirty days after the Effective Date, the Borrower will open, and&#13;
thereafter maintain until completion of the project, a deposit account, under terms&#13;
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, for purposes of depositing the counterpart&#13;
funds and make an initial deposit of US$ 1,500,000 equivalent in that account&#13;
(para. 3.23); and&#13;
Gj)   the Borrower will comply with the agreed action program for institutional&#13;
development (Table 3.1).&#13;
4.2   Recommendation. With the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank fixed-&#13;
rate single currency loan of US$ 75 million, with standard amortization term, grace period and&#13;
interest rate and an expected disbursement period of 3-6 years.&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
SEOPC's ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE&#13;
A.   Administrative System&#13;
1.    The administrative system at SEOPC is highly centralized and congested. The&#13;
overcentralized power and decision making structure at Secretary level is just the reflect of the&#13;
global system of administration prevailing at the country's public level, according to a "Diagnostic&#13;
on the Central Financial Organization and Plan for the Development of the Quality and Timing of&#13;
the Accounting-Finance Information of the SEOPC" ("the Diagnostic"), presented by Horwarth&#13;
Consulting in January 1995.&#13;
2.    The current centralized organization goes against the necessary delegation of the&#13;
administrative processes toward the lower, hierarchical levels (departments and divisions) and the&#13;
Districts. These, however, should be strengthened before any substantive delegation or&#13;
administrative decentralization is decided.&#13;
3.    The institutional growth and functions diversification of the SEOPC has not run in&#13;
parallel, however, to a similar trend in the legal and normative framework. It is necessary the&#13;
harmonization of the laws and the issuing of the related regulations which allow for the proper&#13;
functioning of the laws and the introduction of structures and systems to streamline the&#13;
administration and functional processes of the SEOPC.&#13;
4.    During project appraisal, it was noticed that there is no a definitive institutional&#13;
organigram in force at the SEOPC; neither the existing organigram is known to all General&#13;
Directorates. As a result, there are certain key officers unaware of which units reporting to him&#13;
are or to where they should report. The secrecy in distributing the official "organization chart"&#13;
has resulted in several cases in a free interpretation of the new reporting and dependency lines. It&#13;
is necessary that a single organigram be produced, approved by the Secretary and distributed&#13;
among all the functional units jointly with the respective Functions Manual.&#13;
B.    Financial Management Structure&#13;
5.    The basic financial management center at the SEOPC is, conventionally, the General&#13;
Directorate of Administration (DGA). The DGA accounts for the three basic functional units:&#13;
Accounting, Budget and Treasury.&#13;
6.    Neither the Budget or the Treasury fulfill a proper financial activity or are used by&#13;
management as managerial control tools or for the preparation of financial projection and&#13;
disbursement programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36 -&#13;
7.    The SEOPC accounting system is totally manual and the accounting process is extremely&#13;
slow. The system does not cover some basic items, such as inventories which, until 1994, were&#13;
handled as expenses rather than as tangible assets. The accounting system in force is not devised&#13;
to produce a regular and reliable flow of management information.&#13;
8.    The Accounting Department at the DGA is not the only accounting unit within the&#13;
SEOPC. Therefore, it cannot be considered, as it should, the central recording system. The&#13;
Administrative Department of External Resources - DARE, created in order to keep record of the&#13;
financial resources from international lending, maintains its own separated accounting system and&#13;
the Directorate for Maintenance of Highways and Rural Roads (DGM) keeps also an accounting&#13;
unit. So, a sense of accounting indiscipline is noted, derived from the existing autonomy and&#13;
disconnection at various levels of the organization. This situation is not conducive to the&#13;
maintenance of controls and reliable information for management.&#13;
9.    In some units, the operations are registered focusing on the programs utilizing computer&#13;
terminals connected to the computer center. But the resulting reports are not reconciled with&#13;
those kept in the Central Accounting Department. Such is the case of the inventory at the Central&#13;
Storage, the fixed assets accounts, the complementary payroll, the issuing of checks by the&#13;
Treasury and the transactions from international resources which are kept separated at DARE.&#13;
Since no formal liaison reporting has been established between these individual units and the&#13;
Central Accounting Department, the information which this Unit should produce for SEOPC is,&#13;
necessarily, incomplete.&#13;
10.   The SEOPC, as an institutional entity, needs a uniform accounting system where the&#13;
individual contributions from the different functional units be summarized and reported -- such is&#13;
the case of DARE. That implies the introduction of a "system by projects" or "principal&#13;
activities" where while recognizing the Government budgetary systems, integrate the different&#13;
sub-accounting centers and records into the Central Accounting of SEOPC. The complete&#13;
computerization of the whole accounting system is definitely a need. The new accounting system&#13;
should be based on a new Chart of Accounts and the whole package should produce an&#13;
Accounting Plan and Financial Information System.&#13;
11.   The whole concept of "financial reporting" at SEOPC should be reviewed. The financial&#13;
execution by projects; keeping of special accounts (such as those needed for reviewing and&#13;
processing bill of quantities); the form, content and distribution of the reports, should be&#13;
revamped. The establishrnent of a timely "management information system" should be the&#13;
ultimate product of the recommended computerized accounting system.&#13;
12.   The Budget Unit is theoretically the coordination center of the budget assigned to the&#13;
SEOPC programs. The keeping of the budget, however, does not allow for the comparison&#13;
between the execution and the accounting records. In fact, there is no formal communication&#13;
system established for the necessary interchange of information between the Budget and the&#13;
Accounting Units. Under the circumstances, it is not possible to establish a "budgetary control"&#13;
and the execution of the budget is divorced from the accounting and treasury functions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
13.   The Treasury unit work consists, basically, of a "payment of checks window" and no&#13;
financial planning or projections of funds are prepared as a decision making element for the&#13;
management.&#13;
14.   During project appraisal, "the Diagnostic" was evaluated and considered a fair account of&#13;
the financial management picture at the SEOPC. Therefore, it is recommended that the SEOPC&#13;
management take the necessary actions in order to design and implement the recommendations&#13;
and conclusions of the consultants. However, it was realized that, except for the incidence in&#13;
DARE, the current financial management situation regarding the accounting, budgetary and&#13;
Treasury functions bear no direct effect on the current or the under study operation. The above&#13;
comments have been included only for the Bank to have a reminder, in any eventual Government&#13;
Reform Program, of the situation in this important area of the SEOPC. At any event in the&#13;
process of the proposed project the SEOPC's management would be warned about the financial&#13;
management condition and urge them to take a corrective action.&#13;
15.   In the area of control the SEOPC has the Units of "Controllership" (Contraloria) and&#13;
Internal Audit. In addition, the "Supervision and Fiscalization of Works Directorate" is in charge&#13;
of technical control. Up to the beginning of the current administration it was a "Controllership&#13;
and Internal Audit" Unit reporting directly to the Secretary of State. Based partially on the&#13;
reconmmendations of the "Diagnostic", this Unit was split in two: "Controllership" and "Internal&#13;
Audit". As a result of the project appraisal mission, the recommendations shown in the two&#13;
following paragraphs were adopted.&#13;
16.   The "Controllership Unit", consisting of a single officer, with no control function,&#13;
technically speaking, was eliminated.&#13;
17.   The Internal Audit Unit's (which used to report to the "Controller") organization,&#13;
functions, standards, apparent quality of the staff, reports produced and its distribution is far away&#13;
from what is considered currently the work of a true internal audit function in a modern&#13;
Government. The staff is inexperienced and in extreme need of training (the low level of salaries&#13;
has been one of the reasons for the departure of senior and qualified staff). The internal audit&#13;
reports are not prepared following professional working standards nor audit procedures. The&#13;
appraisal mission prepared the attached (see attached Appendix) "Suggested Organization"&#13;
"Profile of the Internal Performance Auditor" and "Terms of Reference for the new Internal&#13;
Performance Audit Unit".&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
TO ANNEX I&#13;
Suggested Organization for a&#13;
"General Directorate of Internal Performance Audit"&#13;
L Concept, Sbucture and Standards&#13;
Concept of Internal Performance Auditing (EPA)&#13;
1.1    The Internal Performance Auditing (IPA) is an independent, "ex-post" appraisal function to&#13;
be established within the Secretariat of Public Works and Communications (SEOPC). To this&#13;
effect, SEOPC should structure a Internal Performance Audit Office (IAO) to be headed&#13;
by a Internal Performance Auditor and staffed with a multidisciplinary professional nix&#13;
compatible with the nature of the activities and programs of SEOPC.&#13;
1.2    The denomination "Internal Performance Audit" clearly shows the current trends in&#13;
Govemment's intemal auditing. In effect, the work of the IPA should go beyond the&#13;
administrative-accounting-financial aspects, to cover as well the value-for-money or&#13;
economy-efficiency-effectiveness of the SEOPC's activities and programs. It should cover&#13;
also the assessment of the work being done intemally with respect to the environment-related&#13;
financial issues, impacts, compliance and evaluations. That is, the intemal audit function&#13;
embraces the total integrateat global performance of the SEOPC.&#13;
1.3    The objective of the IAO should be to furnish the SEOPC with analysis, appraisals,&#13;
recommendations and counsel, on the SEOPC's operations, programs, projects, activities and&#13;
functions.&#13;
1.4    The function of the IAO is of a prevenfive and advisory nature. However, it would closely&#13;
monitor the achievement of the institutional objectives andgoals and thefinancial,&#13;
administrative, institutional, and- when applicable - environmentalperformance of the&#13;
SEOPC's operations and programs.&#13;
1.5    Consistent with the current international understanding of the intemal audit function, this&#13;
should be exercised, as indicated in paragraph 1.1, on an "ex post" perspective; that is, it&#13;
should not be the responsibility of the IPA to pre-control orpre-approve any of the&#13;
operations or transactions whose processing is the responsibility of the regular administrative&#13;
and operational units of the organization.&#13;
1.6    The Internal Performance Audit function is independent (i) in the sense that the Internal&#13;
Perforrnance Auditor, although administratively reporting to the head of SEOPC, still must be&#13;
independent.from the functions subject to his/her examinations and evaluations, and (ii)&#13;
because he/she must use independence of criterion while exercising such functions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
IL ProfleoftheinternalPerformanceAuditor (PA)&#13;
2.1     The individuals to be engaged in the Internal Performance Audit activities should represent,&#13;
as needed, a multidisciplinway professional origin: accounting, business adninistration or&#13;
management; and engineering, law, economics, environmental sciences, and, when justified,&#13;
social sciences.&#13;
2.2     The LAO shall be headed by a professional with proven experience in financial management,&#13;
accountingand auditing the Internal Performance Auditor (IPA).&#13;
2.3    In order to be eligible for the IPA position the candidate must have a University background&#13;

University graduates (in Economics, Law, etc.) could also be considered as long as they have&#13;
working experience in the broad area offinancial management, preferably in the public&#13;
sector. Specific training in modern internal auditing can be obtained through "ad hoc" crash&#13;
programs of study. In addition, the candidate should have not less than five years of&#13;
combined professional experience in the private and public sectors in any of the above&#13;
mentioned fields.&#13;
2.4     The candidate should be endowed with professional integrity and honesty.&#13;
2.5     The candidate should be subject to the necessaty updating/training in the areas of knowledge&#13;
required for the proper discharge of his/her responsibilities.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
Government of the Dominican Republic&#13;
Secretariat of Public Works and Communications (SEOPC)&#13;
POLICY DECLARATION FOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
1.    The Government of the Dominican Republic will, through the proposed National&#13;
Highways Project, engage a consultant to assist SEOPC in developing a transport sector&#13;
policy. In the interim, the government's current policy and strategy in the sector are&#13;
presented below:&#13;
A.    General Transport Policy&#13;
2.    The Government's policy in the transport sector is aimed at:&#13;
(a) increasing competition among the various operators in the sector;&#13;
(b) fostering in the participation of the private sector both in investments and the&#13;
administration and operation of services;&#13;
(c) modernizing, repairing and maintaining the country's deteriorated transport&#13;
infrastructure;&#13;
(d) increasing the efficiency of the sector's agencies;&#13;
(e) ensuring adequate cost recovery in the sector; and&#13;
(f) integrating environmental impact and mitigatory measures more closely in the&#13;
planning, design, construction and operation of the sector's facilities.&#13;
B.    Increased Competition&#13;
3.    The Government's policy on competition in the sector is to foster unimpeded&#13;
access and competition. To that end, the Government will review the regulatory&#13;
mechanisms presently in place and modify them, as necessary, to achieve that policy&#13;
objective.&#13;
C.    Private Sector Participation&#13;
4.    Government's policy envisages the participation of the private sector in financing&#13;
transport facilities which would then be operated under concession contracts with the&#13;
private sector. This includes investments in both port and airport improvements as well as&#13;
in major roads to be operated as toll roads. With regard to operating transport facilities,&#13;
private sector participation is already a reality. Practically all the country's ports and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
airports operate under some type of concession arrangement for cargo and passenger&#13;
handling and for maintenance activities. For ports, the Government, under a proposed&#13;
loan being discussed with the 1DB, plans to redefine the role of the Dominican Port&#13;
Authority to be normative while the private sector increases its participation in those&#13;
services in which it has demonstrated a greater efficiency and effectiveness. For civil&#13;
aviation, the Government is holding discussions with various interested parties for the&#13;
operation of the routes of the national carrier, the Dominican Aviation Company. For&#13;
roads, the Government already uses the private sector for all road construction and&#13;
rehabilitation and for periodic maintenance. Under the proposed National Roads Project&#13;
being discussed with the he World Bank, the Government will embark on a program of&#13;
routine maintenance by private contractors.&#13;
5.    Despite the important investments made recently in the sector, much work remains&#13;
to be done in view of the increased transport demand and the changing base of the&#13;
economy with increased contribution from tourism and free zones. In order to permit the&#13;
transport sector to play its role adequately, the Government has embarked on a program&#13;
to modernize the facilities, rehabilitate deteriorated infrastructure and continue to establish&#13;
effective maintenance systems to prevent further deterioration. In the planning of the&#13;
resources to be spent on these activities, the Government uses economic, financial,&#13;
technical and environmental criteria accepted world-wide.&#13;
6.    Modernization: For ports, a proposed loan from the IDB is aimed, inter alia, at&#13;
assisting in modernizing the facilities at the country's major ports. For highways, the&#13;
proposed National Highways Project, to be financed by the World Bank, would assist in&#13;
widening high-traffic main roads which have exceeded their and replace major bridges&#13;
which have either reached the end of their economic lives or their load bearing capacity.&#13;
For urban roads, a major study is under way to determine the scope and cost of activities&#13;
required, upgrade urban road infrastructure, improve mass transit service and modernize&#13;
traffic regulation.&#13;
7.    Repair and Maintenance: The Government intends to rehabilitate the major&#13;
ports as part of its concession strategy. Their subsequent maintenance would be carried&#13;
out as part of the concession by the private sector. For roads, ongoing projects with the&#13;
World Bank and the IDB are already helping to repair the main network and feeder roads&#13;
respectively. The proposed World Bank project would assist in continuing this effort. In&#13;
the case of roads, the Government expects that the increased involvement of the private&#13;
contractors in carrying out routine maintenance would lead to higher efficiency. Also,&#13;
SEOPC's ongoing pilot program on the use of cold mixes for resurfacing is expected to&#13;
reduce the cost of maintenance and permit wider coverage with maintenance funds.&#13;
E.    Increasing the Efficiency of the Sector's Agencies&#13;
8.    A major objective of the Government is to strengthen the sector's institutions to&#13;
effectively discharge their duties. The Government is fully aware that inefficient&#13;
institutions play as much role as insufficient funding in the sector's ineffectiveness. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Government will take the necessary steps under the Proposed National Roads Project to&#13;
improve the coordination of investment planning and policy formulation among the&#13;
sector's agencies by consolidating that responsibility, de facto as well as de jure, within the&#13;
SEOPC. A consultant would be hired under the project to assist the SEOPC to formulate&#13;
an overall transport sector policy. SEOPC's Planning Department would also be&#13;
strengthen through the recruitment of one transport economist and a consulting firm to&#13;
assist in coordinating and consolidating the investment plans of the various transport&#13;
sector agencies.&#13;
9.    The government has identified the need in the ports sub-sector to separate out the&#13;
normative functions of planning, setting standards, regulating port activities and&#13;
formulating policy from operating and maintaining port facilities. The Government has&#13;
adopted, as part of its discussions with the IDB, a plan to assign the normative functions&#13;
to the Dominican Port authority and to leave the operations and maintenance to the&#13;
private sector in the form of concessions.&#13;
10.  In the roads sub-sector, the Government will continue the institutional&#13;
strengthening of the SEOPC, especially in planning maintenance and in managing&#13;
contracted maintenance. The Government will also improve the capacity of SEOPC's&#13;
Planning Department to coordinate overall sector planning and policy formulation.&#13;
F.    Ensuring adequate Cost Recovery in the Sector&#13;
11.   Ports, airports and road-user charges currently in force adequately cover the&#13;
marginal costs for each of the sub-sectors. However, in both ports and airports current&#13;
charges make no allowance for depreciation of assets. In the increasing use of&#13;
concessions in port and airport operations and maintenance, the Government plans to&#13;
allow for such depreciation in its costing of the concessions. In the case of roads, it is&#13;
Government's policy to adjust road-user charges to at least cover the maintenance and the&#13;
administration of the network.&#13;
G.   Environmental Impact and Mitigation in Transport&#13;
12.   The Government is committed to environmentally sustainable development. To&#13;
this end, the Government's policy is to integrate into the planning, design construction,&#13;
maintenance and operation of all transport facilities an analysis of the environmental&#13;
impact and to provide, where necessary, for mitigating adverse impacts. In both the&#13;
proposed port loan with the IDB and the proposed National Highways Project to be&#13;
financed by the World Bank, all project components will be subject to the above&#13;
environmental policy.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
ROAD MAINTENANCE ADMINISTRATION AND PROGRAMMING&#13;
A.   Current Organization and Management of Road Maintenance&#13;
1.01  Background. Prior to Executive Decree No. 326-87 of June 18, 1987, road maintenance&#13;
in the Dominican Republic was the responsibility of two separate and entirely independent&#13;
General Directorates: the General Directorate of Road Maintenance for national roads and the&#13;
General Directorate of Rural Roads. With the Decree No. 326-87, they were merged into one,&#13;
the General Directorate of Highways and Rural Roads (DGM). This new entity was made&#13;
responsible for the maintenance of both national and rural roads, as well as related bridges,&#13;
structures and drainage works, and incorporated the former Directorate General of Rural Roads.&#13;
Since then, the staff of the two previous entities have come under the same management. The&#13;
departments, sections and units of the new DGM attend to the maintenance of both national and&#13;
local roads, although some sections belong to different lines of command.&#13;
1.02 Personnel. In June 1993, DGM had a total of 4,510 staff, at a payroll cost of DR$48.6&#13;
million (US$3.9 million), to attend to the routine and periodic maintenance of 5,050 km of&#13;
highways and 12,860 km of rural roads. Some 3,000 staff were employed in highway&#13;
maintenance at a payroll cost of DR$34 million (US$2.7 million). This represented a significant&#13;
reduction in maintenance labor costs, which had thus been brought down from 80% of total&#13;
maintenance cost in 1989 to 53% in 1993. However, in 1994, due to a reduced budget allocation&#13;
with the same manpower force, the roadworks payroll figure rose again in percentage terms,&#13;
reaching 67.5% of total maintenance cost (Graph IA). The proposed project will drastically&#13;
reverse this trend, since roadwork manpower is projected to cost US$134,000 in the year 2001&#13;
(Graph IB), for a total work force of 115 individuals (Graph IB).&#13;
1.03  Equipment Management. There are currently two Subdirectorates of Equipment and&#13;
Transportation, one based in Santo Domingo and the other in Santiago. While not clearly&#13;
defined, their functions are similar, although the Santiago branch is supervised by its counterpart&#13;
in Santo Domingo. This situation explains why in some cases the lines of command disappear,&#13;
and information flows do not provide a clearer and better basis for decision-making.&#13;
1.04 In 1994, DGM set up an Equipment Management Unit, vesting it with responsibility for&#13;
reviewing: (a) requisitions for tires and batteries, and (b) consumption of fuel and lubricants.&#13;
Although this Unit is not shown on the most recent DGM organization chart, it should be&#13;
incorporated into the Subdirectorate of Equipment and support the districts and subdistricts&#13;
(ayudantias) as far as equipment operation and maintenance is concerned. If the Unit were given&#13;
new terms of reference that included technical management of equipment, it would be of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
invaluable assistance in implementing the Equipment Management System, in particular for repairs&#13;
and preventive maintenance.&#13;

1.05 Assignment and Distribution of Equipment. DGM equipment is distributed among&#13;
four maintenance districts, divided in their turn into 21 subdistricts. Currently, the Equipment and&#13;
Transportation Subdirectorate which is headquartered in Santo Domingo is responsible for&#13;
assigning units of maintenance equipment to the various districts, and each district for assignments&#13;
to its own subdistricts. Operation and maintenance of this equipment is the responsibility of&#13;
district and subdistrict managers. Table A2. 1 shows the composition of the present fleet, by type&#13;
of unit.&#13;

1.06  Since road maintenance activities are not "programmed," in the strict sense of the word, it&#13;
is not possible to obtain a clear picture of equipment use. Neither, therefore, is it possible to give&#13;
a breakdown of the specific maintenance works for which each unit is used, or to generate reliable&#13;
data on equipment use rates and availability. In order to arrive at a satisfactory appraisal of the&#13;
state of the equipment fleet and ascertain whether the present fleet is large enough, the following&#13;
would be required: (a) an inventory of all units, including their mechanical condition; (b) a&#13;
highway and rural road maintenance program; and (c) an estimate -- based on the program -- of&#13;
the types of units needed, and the number needed of each type. The technical assistance team&#13;
financed under Loan 3350-DO to advise on maintenance management is currently working on&#13;
these three aspects of the problem.&#13;
1.07 Workshops. At the present time, DGM operates the following workshops:&#13;
(a)    Two Type A workshops in Santo Domingo (i.e. supporting the subdistrict&#13;
workshops), one for vehicles (light mechanics) and the other for equipment (heavy&#13;
mechanics);&#13;
(b)   one Type A workshop for equipment in Santiago, with similar capacity to the one&#13;
in Santo Domingo;&#13;
(c)   six Type B workshops (responsible for preventive maintenance and repair of minor&#13;
components), located in Azua, San Francisco de Macoris, Montecristi, San Pedro&#13;
de Macoris, San Juan, and Barahona; and&#13;
(d)   eight Type C workshops (only for preventive maintenance), located in Monte&#13;
Plata, Mao, Loma de Cabrera, San Crist6bal, Higuey, Cotui, Nagua, and Duverge.&#13;
1.08  The functions of each workshop depend on its classification, although the information&#13;
available on jobs in progress leaves much to be desired. Communication and coordination among&#13;
the various workshops is less than adequate, although terms of reference governing their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
organization and functions were drawn up. Consultants are preparing a new organization and&#13;
functions for the workshops, reducing their number and potential capacity to coincide with the&#13;
gradual cutback in maintenance by force account.&#13;
1.09 Warehouses. DGM operates a central warehouse in Santo Domingo, set up as the lead&#13;
unit in charge of organizing and supervising the other warehouses and supplying them with spare&#13;
parts purchased by itself In the districts and subdistricts, DGM operates fourteen more&#13;
warehouse facilities, which hold a reduced inventory of spares that are requisitioned as necessary&#13;
for delivery to the workshops.&#13;
1.10  There is not the kind of communication between the central and satellite warehouses&#13;
which allows the stocks held in each of them to be determined at a given moment. Nor are&#13;
periodic checks made to ascertain whether inventory recorded as being in stock coincides with&#13;
actual holdings. Despite the merging of the two former General Directorates in 1987, there are&#13;
cases of duplication of facilities, making it advisable to carry out a study to determine which&#13;
should be retained. The consultants are also preparing a new warehousing plan consistent with&#13;
the staffing and equipment cutbacks referred to above.&#13;
1.11  Training. Personnel training began under the Second Road Maintenance and&#13;
Reconstruction Project (Loan 1784-DO), with the establishment of "training production units"&#13;
(UPEs) directed by Roy Jorgensen Associates, Inc., consultants. The training methodology&#13;
consisted of intensive theoretical instruction backed up by practical classes supervised and&#13;
conducted by previously trained instructors. The practical component involved maintenance of&#13;
road sections (as part of the mobile UPE) plus repair of equipment (as part of the mechanics&#13;
UPE). From 1981 to 1986, continuous financing was available for these training arrangements,&#13;
which included building and launching the Santa Caputa workshop in Sanchez. The results speak&#13;
for themselves: more than 600 individuals trained, some of them to the level of first class&#13;
mechanic; rehabilitation of 39 equipment units; and repairs on a total of 105 units.&#13;
1.12 Following the merger of the two General Directorates, training center operations were&#13;
discontinued, and the facility itself was dismantled in February 1990. As far as current problems&#13;
are concerned, which have to do mainly with equipment management, an operator training&#13;
program has been launched as part of the ongoing project, with another for mechanics to follow.&#13;
B.    Maintenance Management and Programs&#13;
2.01  Background: Resource allocations for road maintenance (routine and periodic) and&#13;
rehabilitation were adequate until approximately 1958, after which a process of steady&#13;
deterioration set in, reaching its lowest point in the early 70s. From 1976 to 1980 there was some&#13;
overall improvement, but between 1980 and 1986 overstaffing, in conjunction with the oil crisis,&#13;
which greatly reduced the country's reserves, resulted in a significant limit on the resources&#13;
available for the road sector, to the point that the maintenance battle was virtually lost (Graph 2).&#13;
2.02  Inadequate maintenance only accelerated the general degree of road deterioration, until&#13;
finally the whole network needed rehabilitation,. This was begun under Loan 2609-DO, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
included financing for the reconstruction of some of the most important highway sections. With&#13;
the backing of this loan -- and later that of Loan 33 50-DO, which was declared effective in&#13;
December 1992 -- the Dominican Government launched a massive road reconstruction/&#13;
rehabilitation offensive in 1987, which meant that there was once again some point to organizing&#13;
maintenance programs. By mid 1994, the policy of reconstruction or rehabilitation had returned&#13;
70% of the road system to a state of good or fair condition -- a figure projected to rise to 87% by&#13;
the end of 1997. In these circumstances, it makes very good sense to strengthen SEOPC&#13;
administratively and technically to monitor the execution of preventive maintenance tasks --&#13;
something that could not be done during earlier periods of technical assistance (1976-1987), when&#13;
the road system was markedly deteriorated.&#13;

2.03  Since its current road maintenance planning and programming capability is limited, the&#13;
DGM normally relies on the Department of Pavement Management and Studies (DAEP) and the&#13;
Directorate General of Investment Planning and Programming to draw up its annual budgets and&#13;
programs, although without the kind of annually updated survey of the road system condition that&#13;
would allow realistic budgeting for necessary activities. As a result of these shortcomings, the&#13;
annual budgets prepared for the last three years have been similar in terms of quantities of work&#13;
and cost estimates -- in other words, hardly more than a hollow formality. As regards the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of program execution, the data the districts are supposed to send in to&#13;
the DGM Planning Unit are either incomplete or nonexistent, which means it is unable to make a&#13;
comparative analysis of programmed versus actual performance and therefore, to produce any ex&#13;
post evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.04  The practice until quite recently was for SEOPC itself to execute the maintenance&#13;
program. Contracting out of periodic maintenance to private sector firm's began to gain ground&#13;
under Loan 2609-DO, increased significantly under Loan 3350-DO and is currently the norm in&#13;
the periodic maintenance of paved roads (resealing, resurfacing). Routine maintenance, however,&#13;
is carried out with SEOPC personnel and equipment, although not satisfactorily or efficiently.&#13;
Senior SEOPC management has fully accepted the need for a preventive maintenance system&#13;
which safeguards the investment already made, but it is still necessary to insist on this policy with&#13;
middle management and to set up the required organization. In a move to rectify present&#13;
maintenance planning and execution arrangements, the technical assistance consultants financed&#13;
under Loan 3350-DO are introducing a maintenance management system, recommending&#13;
procedures for the contracting out of preventive (routine) maintenance, and training the SEOPC&#13;
personnel who will be planning and monitoring maintenance programs in the future. The&#13;
proposed project would finance: (i) a pilot program to foster and develop the contracting out of&#13;
routine maintenance as a first step, and of all maintenance subsequently, and (ii) technical&#13;
assistance and goods required for completion of the necessary institutional development.&#13;
2.05 Future Management and Organization: In addition to contributing substantially to the&#13;
Government's ongoing road reconstruction/rehabilitation effort, Loan 3350-DO included two&#13;
important components focused on ensuring that the benefit of that effort would be sustainable: (a)&#13;
the previously mentioned technical assistance with introduction of a road maintenance&#13;
management system (SAMC) and preparation for the contracting out of routine maintenance; and&#13;
(b) a pavement technology transfer program (periodic maintenance). Both programs began in&#13;
early 1995 and are expected to conclude in 1997, with the following results:&#13;
(a)   institutionalization, within SEOPC, of a management system that will allow&#13;
programming, monitoring and evaluation of preventive and periodic road&#13;
maintenance;&#13;
(b)   implementation of contracting maintenance activities out to private sector&#13;
enterprises, strengthening of the current practice of contracting out present&#13;
periodic maintenance (sealing and surfacing), and introducing contracting out of&#13;
routine maintenance (including patching) -- programs for which the proposed&#13;
project includes financing;&#13;
(c)   technical and managerial upgrading of firms engaged in road maintenance, through&#13;
the transfer of appropriate technology, especially in selection of materials, use of&#13;
equipment and tools, operating and construction methods, and organization and&#13;
management;&#13;
(d)   establishment of a road maintenance fund, which guarantees the availability of&#13;
funds for programmed maintenance (through special accounts earmarked for the&#13;
deposit of user charges), and administration of this fund by a new road agency --&#13;
possibly a joint organization combining government and user representatives;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
(e)    development of an ongoing training program for DGM personnel, focused on&#13;
recognition of the profession of "road maintenance specialist" under the provisions&#13;
of the Civil Service Act.&#13;
2.06 Management System. The road maintenance management system, under implementation&#13;
in the DGM with funds provided under Loan 3350-DO, follows the general outlines indicated&#13;
above and is being introduced in the following stages:&#13;
(a)    1995-2000: Restructuring of the road maintenance organization, with special&#13;
attention to be paid to:&#13;
(i)    preparation of the road condition inventory, including traffic data;&#13;
(ii)    cataloguing of job positions, introduction of the administrative career of&#13;
road maintenance specialist and preparation of a program for institutional&#13;
reorganization of the road maintenance system. These aspects will be kept&#13;
in time with the gradual implementation of maintenance by contract, which&#13;
will begin in 1997 and will be extended to the whole network by 2001&#13;
(Table A2.2).&#13;

2/     SEOPC will carry out emergency maintenance (cave-ins, landslides, and the like) directly, either alone&#13;
or with assistance from contractors, besides serving as the administrative structure for the supervision and&#13;
monitoring of contracts and contractors.&#13;
(iii)    introduction at central and district levels of a road maintenance planning&#13;
and monitoring system to be used by both SEOPC and contractors for the&#13;
maintenance programs indicated for the transition period (197-2001) in&#13;
the appendix to this Annex.&#13;
(iv)    training of personnel for implementing and monitoring the routine&#13;
maintenance by contract program;&#13;
(v)     execution of the pilot program of routine maintenance by contract (1997-&#13;
2000) to be funded under the proposed project -- on the road sections&#13;
specifically selected for this purpose (Table A5.3, Annex 5);&#13;
(vi)    launching of productive training programs (in which participants carry out&#13;
assigned tasks similar to those they will perform in their jobs) for&#13;
operations personnel (administrators, technical inspectors, foremen,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
equipment operators, monitoring clerks, cost-control and accounting&#13;
personnel, etc.).&#13;
(b)   2001 and beyond: From 2001 onwards, SEOPC will be directly responsible only&#13;
for emergency and non-programmable activities, roadworks in which contractors&#13;
evince no interest, and supervisory and inspection functions. SEOPC will also&#13;
retain responsibility for planning, programming, monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
results.&#13;
2.07 Concerning equipment, workshop and training management, the action plan scheduled for&#13;
the period from 1997 to 2000 consists of: (i) removal of non-operational equipment units from the&#13;
fleet, and adjustment of fleet size and composition to adequately cover highway maintenance&#13;
(emergencies + works of no interest to contractors) and rural road maintenance; (ii) rehabilitation&#13;
of essential equipment; (iii) selection and conditioning of workshop and warehouse facilities,&#13;
chiefly those involved in preventive maintenance and minor repairs; and (iv) establishment of a&#13;
training entity and training program, with support from equipment suppliers.&#13;
2.08 Future Management and Organization Structure. Charts I and II show, respectively,&#13;
an initial proposal for DGM's management structure and the corresponding organization chart.&#13;
2.09 Resource Control. The financial resources required to ensure an acceptable level of&#13;
maintenance (routine and periodic) amount to approximately DR$160 million (US$13 million) per&#13;
year. This sum is large enough to warrant not only management and execution of the related&#13;
works programs but also the backing of decisions to ensure that those funds are spent rationally&#13;
and efficiently. In addition, the programming and budgeting for all maintenance work, whether&#13;
preventive or periodic, is approved by the Executive Branch and endorsed by the Congress via&#13;
enactment of each year's Budget Law. This means that the Office of the Inspector General&#13;
('Contralor") of the Republic has to verify -- at least through financial audits -- that budgetary&#13;
commitments have been fulfilled. Furthennore, the proposed project calls for introduction of both&#13;
technical and financial audit by independent technical and financial auditors (see main text, paras.&#13;
1.29, 2.06 and 3.07, and Annex 11.) to monitor the impact on maintenance expenditures and&#13;
activities of the proposed reforms.&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
PREVIOUS BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
1.    The Bank's past involvement in the road transport sub-sector dates back to 1973,&#13;
when it acted as the executing agency for the UNDP-financed Highway Rehabilitation and&#13;
Administration Study. Between 1976 and 1985, three highway projects were financed&#13;
under Bank loans, totaling US$65 million, to improve the condition of some 320 kmi, or&#13;
about six percent of the highway network. Those projects were: the First Road&#13;
Maintenance and Reconstruction Project; the Emergency Road Reconstruction Project;&#13;
and, the Second Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project.&#13;
2.    The First Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project (Loan 1316-DO, US$5&#13;
million, 1976) provided for the reconstruction of a section of the Duarte highway&#13;
connecting the capital with Santiago, the second largest city. Other components were a&#13;
bridge rehabilitation program and support to the Road Maintenance Directorate of&#13;
SEOPC. The Project Performance Audit Report No. 3716 (Board Doc. No. Sec. M-81-&#13;
987) of 1981 indicated that project implementation generally developed as planned, but&#13;
price increases forced a reduction in the scope of the project since it took 2.5 years to&#13;
achieve congressional ratification and effectiveness of the loan.&#13;
3.    The second Bank operation was an Emergency Road Reconstruction Project&#13;
(Loan 1783-DO, US$25 million, 1980), which was approved by the Bank in the wake of&#13;
the September 1979 hurricane. It supported reconstruction of 150 km of hurricane-&#13;
damaged roads connecting agricultural areas in the northwest with Santiago and in the&#13;
southwest with Santo Domingo. Because of its emergency nature, the loan was approved&#13;
by the Bank before engineering designs were available for the project. When these were&#13;
later completed and bids were received, it became evident, even after lowering standards&#13;
to obtain cost savings, that project costs would be about 50% above those estimated at&#13;
loan approval. The Project Completion Report (December 1984) indicates that beginning&#13;
implementation of the project on the basis of incomplete engineering work was the&#13;
primary cause of later delays and cost increases, but that the project, when completed,&#13;
remained economically justified.&#13;
4.    The third road project was the Second Road Maintenance and Reconstruction&#13;
Project (Loan 1784-DO, US$35 million, 1980), amended in 1983 to provide the necessary&#13;
financing to complete the Emergency Project's road works. The amendment, resulting in&#13;
the expenditure of some of the funds originally intended for the Second Road Maintenance&#13;
and Reconstruction Project, caused, in turn, an unfinanced gap for civil works originally&#13;
included in that project. To remedy this, one of the main objectives of the Third (fourth&#13;
project) Road Reconstruction Project was to close the financing gap to complete&#13;
reconstruction of the 150 km that were not finished under the Loan 1784-DO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
5.   In 1986 the fourth operation, the Third Road Reconstruction Project (Loan 2609-&#13;
DO, US$35.8 million) was approved. It provided financing for: reconstruction of 150 km&#13;
of highways that were started under Loan 1784-DO, and about 60 km of other high-&#13;
priority highways; purchase of road maintenance equipment and spare parts; consulting&#13;
services for construction supervision; a transport planning study; and assistance in training&#13;
the Pavement Division staff of DGPP and in organizing workshops and stores. Generally,&#13;
the project was executed as planned and completed on December 31, 1993.&#13;
6.    The project's scope was appropriate for the country's needs but its implementation&#13;
was beset by problems which delayed its completion. Most of the roads, especially those&#13;
added to the road program in 1990, were finished in good time. However, the completion&#13;
of some reconstruction works contracted in 1981 took about six to ten years (1981-1991)&#13;
instead of four, as originally scheduled. In retrospect, the problems with these roads could&#13;
have been avoided had more attention been given during project preparation to avoid&#13;
repetition of problems experienced by the SEOPC (which hindered implementation of&#13;
preceding Bank financed projects) namely, starting project implementation with&#13;
inadequately prepared engineering and deficient planning and programming for the&#13;
execution of the road works initially included in the project. On the other hand,&#13;
engineering designs and procurement procedures prepared for the reconstruction works&#13;
that were added to the works program in 1990 improved markedly and the works were&#13;
successfully carried out within their allocated budgets, under the supervision of a&#13;
competent local consulting firm.&#13;
7.    The lessons learned confirm that to ensure successful implementation of Bank&#13;
projects it is necessary, during the project preparation stage, to emphasize the need for&#13;
uncompromising quality of engineering designs and contracting qualified contractors and&#13;
consultants. Other issues which should have been addressed concerned the Borrowers'&#13;
sense of ownership of some project components (in particular the Transport Plan) and its&#13;
commitment to support and achieve the agreed project objectives for those components by&#13;
providing the required human and financial resources and logistic support. The project&#13;
also demonstrated the benefit of maintaining an open and productive dialogue with the&#13;
Borrower, which apparently resulted in a more intensive involvement of SEOPC's higher&#13;
level staff in the execution of the project, facilitating the project's implementation and&#13;
ensuring close collaboration with the pre&gt;ect executing agency.&#13;
8.    The Fifth Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Loan 3350-DO, US$79&#13;
million, 1991) was declared effective on December 2, 1992. The project comprises: (a)&#13;
rehabilitation of about 830 km of roads and supervision of these works; (b) a technology&#13;
transfer program on pavements, including technical assistance and civil works; (c) bridge&#13;
and workshop rehabilitation; (d) equipment rehabilitation; (e) acquisition of road signaling&#13;
materials, maintenance equipment and scales for vehicle weight control; and (f) technical&#13;
assistance for training SEOPC's maintenance staff, road maintenance management, an&#13;
urban transport study, a local construction industry study and engineering services for&#13;
road design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
9.    Past lessons learned have helped to successfully implement this project.&#13;
Prequalification of contractors and bidding documents were agreed at negotiations; ICB&#13;
procedures applied to all civil works of the road rehabilitation program; engineering&#13;
designs were prepared well in advance to the bidding process; and the open dialogue with&#13;
the Borrower continued. As a result, procurement is already completed; the contract for&#13;
the pavement technology transfer program (a major component) is satisfactorily&#13;
underway; compliance with loan covenants and the Action Plan is acceptable; and about&#13;
75% of the loan is already disbursed.&#13;
10.   However, the proceeds of the Loan will only reach to finance about 70% of the&#13;
length of highway rehabilitation originally programmed. The main reasons for this&#13;
reduction are cost increases for civil works, due to higher unit costs and the additional&#13;
road deterioration that took place since the project was appraised and, above all, the&#13;
upgrade of most of the works from rehabilitation to reconstruction. On the other hand, the&#13;
SEOPC rehabilitated more than 900 km in the same period with local funds, which is more&#13;
than the length finally not financed by the Loan. The technology transfer program, a&#13;
single component and the biggest contract of the project (including about 500 Km of&#13;
highway resurfacing) is being implemented as planned and within the resources allocated&#13;
in the Loan.&#13;

ANEXO 6.1&#13;
REPUBLICA DOMINICANA&#13;
PROYECTO DE CARRETERAS NACIONALES&#13;
TkRMINOS DE REFERENCIA PARA LA SUPERVISI6N DE OBRAS CIVLES&#13;
A.    Servicios Requeridos&#13;
1.    Introducci6n. Los servicios que se describen en los parrafos siguientes del&#13;
presente documento se refieren a la supervisi6n de las obras civiles de ampliaci6n,&#13;
construcci6n y reconstrucci6n de carreteras y puentes incluidas en el proyecto que se&#13;
propone. Las firmas consultoras interesadas deberan conocer todos los documentos de&#13;
licitaci6n de las obras a supervisar, asi como toda aquella informaci6n que fuese necesario&#13;
recopilar para la evaluaci6n de los requerimientos y la confecci6n de su oferta.&#13;
2.    Informes y Documentos. Todos los informes y documentos se presentarin en&#13;
formato 81/2xl 1" y los planos doblados en el mismo formato. Se seguira una secuencia&#13;
numerada. En la portada constara el titulo del proyecto, nuimero del informe y contenido.&#13;
Los informes tendran indice y paginas numeradas.&#13;
3.    Revisi6n Inicial de los Proyectos. Dado el tiempo transcurrido entre la toma de&#13;
datos, la redacci6n del proyecto base, la licitaci6n y la adjudicaci6n de las obras y el&#13;
comienzo de las mismas, la primera tarea del Consultor serk, la revisi6n, y modificaci6n en&#13;
su caso, del "proyecto de ejecuci6n" que debera realizar en el plazo de 2 meses. El&#13;
supervisor podra utilizar toda aquella informaci6n del proyecto base que considere&#13;
oportuna y la complementara hasta concluir un documento que identifique y defina&#13;
claramente la obra a ejecutar y permita al contratista la construcci6n y su programaci6n sin&#13;
vacios de definici6n. Las posibles modificaciones que se consideren y los variaciones&#13;
presupuestarias que resulten seran discutidas y aprobadas en su caso por la SEOPC,&#13;
siempre dentro del alcance inicial del proyecto base.&#13;
4.    Plan de Control. El plan de control consistira basicamente en la definici6n de una&#13;
guia de toma de datos, ensayos, medidas y comprobaciones para cada unidad y fase de&#13;
obra, estableciendo parametros minimos y criterios de aceptaci6n para el avance de la&#13;
obra, la observaci6n y paralizaci6n de esta, su aprobaci6n o su rechazo; estableciendo para&#13;
ello un conjunto de sistemas de operaci6n. Este plan sera sometido a la SEOPC para su&#13;
aprobaci6n. Tambien se establecera una colecci6n de formularios para ensayos de&#13;
laboratorio y otros controles que permitan su mejor identificaci6n, seguimiento y archivo,&#13;
definiendo dos campos: control geometrico y control de calidad. El primer campo para&#13;
verificar: (i) la concordancia de la construcci6n con las lineas generales de proyecto, y las&#13;
tolerancias asumibles; y (ii) las mediciones, y cubicaciones del contratista. El segundo&#13;
campo para verificar: (i) el cumplimiento de las especificaciones y normativa,&#13;
estableciendo al mismo tiempo frecuencia y tolerancias; y (ii) el cumplimiento de los&#13;
estandares de calidad en el proceso constructivo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
5.    Revisi6n de las Medidas de Mitigaci6n de Posibles Impactos. El consultor&#13;
revisari las medidas de mitigaci6n de impacto previstas en cada subproyecto considerando&#13;
los aspectos socioecon6mico y ambiental.&#13;
6.    Propuesta de Sefhalizaci6n y Balizamiento de Obra. El consultor propondra un&#13;
disefio de seftalizaci6n horizontal y vertical durante las obras que permita ejecutarlas en&#13;
suficientes condiciones de seguridad.&#13;
7.    Propuesta de Conservaci6n y Mantenimiento durante las Obras. El consultor&#13;
propondra un sistema de conservaci6n y mantenimiento durante la ejecuci6n de las obras,&#13;
teniendo en cuenta los datos basicos del proyecto, estableciendo unas condiciones minimas&#13;
de servicio y un nivel maximo de deterioro admisible e indicando las acciones a&#13;
implementar en cada caso y una estimaci6n de su costo.&#13;
8.    Acta de Replanteo. El consultor coordinara una reuni6n de la SEOPC con el&#13;
contratista y 61 mismo para dar inicio oficial a la obras, realizando una visita al lugar de las&#13;
mismas y recogiendo en un acta aquellos planteamientos que expongan las partes que&#13;
puedan afectar o no sean congruentes con la documentaci6n contractual; asimismo&#13;
recogera en el acta los acuerdos y/o acciones a realizar y anexari los informes y&#13;
documentos necesarios.&#13;
9.    Informe Inicial. El consultor redactara un informe con todas las incidencias&#13;
previas al inicio de las obras en el que incluira: (i) fechas de pago de anticipo; (ii) acta de&#13;
replanteo y programa de obra actualizado; (iii) modificaciones del proyecto base recogidas&#13;
en el proyecto de ejecuci6n, tanto de disefio como presupuestarias; (iv) medidas previstas&#13;
para la resoluci6n de los problemas encontrados al inicio de la obra; (v) evaluaci6n del&#13;
sobrecosto de la aplicaci6n de dichas medidas; y (vi) evaluaci6n de la posibilidad de&#13;
cumplimiento de las metas del proyecto .&#13;
10.   Contrataci6n de un Laboratorio Homologado. El consultor analizara la&#13;
propuesta de contrataci6n del laboratorio presentada por el contratista y confirmari que&#13;
refine las condiciones necesarias y suficientes para desarrollar eficazmente el plan de&#13;
control previsto. Asimismo, preparara las condiciones para la coordinaci6n eficaz con la&#13;
obra, plazos para los resultados de los ensayos y penalizaciones por retrasos 6 perdidas.&#13;
11.   Redisefios y Cambios. El consultor realizara todos los diseflos de partes de obra&#13;
que deban modificarse por alguna raz6n tecnica o por indicaci6n directa de la SEOPC.&#13;
Estos disefnos incluiran memoria, planos y presupuesto conciliado con el contratista y se&#13;
redactaran en el formato y como complemento del proyecto de ejecuci6n. El supervisor&#13;
completara esta etapa con la rapidez necesaria en cada caso para afectar lo menos posible&#13;
el programa de obra.&#13;
12.   Evaluaci6n de Controles. El consultor mantendra los sistemas propuestos en el&#13;
plan de control para la evaluaci6n de los resultados de los ensayos y controles de obra, de&#13;
tal forma que la emisi6n de dictamenes (valoraci6n, rechazo o aceptaci6n) se produzca de&#13;
forma automatica, con la mayor rapidez y asegurando la comunicaci6n al contratista; asi&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
evitara retenciones o paralizaciones innecesarias del ciclo productivo de partes de obra&#13;
que puedan convertirse posteriormente en causal de reclamaci6n del contratista. Todas&#13;
estas evaluaciones se archivaran junto con los resultados de los ensayos.&#13;
13.   Programaci6n. El consultor: (i) realizara un seguimiento mensual del programa&#13;
de obra, extrapolando, con rigor y con base en los avances reales y rendirnientos&#13;
promedios, la fecha de terminaci6n mas probable de la obra y mantendra puntualmente&#13;
informados a la SEOPC y al contratista del programa; (ii) mantendra reuniones con el&#13;
contratista para analizar el programa y tomar medidas implementando mas o mejores&#13;
medios en caso de existir retrasos imputables al contratista; (iii) preparara un nuevo&#13;
programa 6 una modificaci6n del existente, buscando lograr las metas previstas; y (iv)&#13;
redactara un acta de cada reuni6n. En todo caso no pasara mas de un mes sin actualizar el&#13;
programa que s6lo podra basarse en rendimniento reales o compromisos firmados por el&#13;
contratista. Los aumentos de plazo deberan someterse a la aprobaci6n de la SEOPC.&#13;
14.   Cubicaciones y Facturaci6n. El consultor tramitara, en el plazo establecido por&#13;
la SEOPC, la cubicaci6n del contratista, para lo cual acordara con el mismo el proceso a&#13;
seguir (fecha de mediciones, forma de presentaci6n, datos y calculos que anexar etc.). El&#13;
supervisor tendra en cuenta todos los aspectos contractuales, (retenci6n, devoluci6n del&#13;
anticipo, penalizaciones, baja de oferta, revisi6n de precios, etc.). La cubicaci6n&#13;
contendra la medici6n, monto y % de avance de cada unidad presupuestaria, tanto del&#13;
mes, como a origen. Los imprevistos, trabajos por administraci6n y partidas nuevas iran&#13;
en sendos capitulos adicionales. El supervisor debera anexar la cubicaci6n revisada a la&#13;
documentaci6n contractual que modifique el contrato vigente, aprobaci6n de precios&#13;
nuevos, 6rdenes de penalizaci6n, pago de impuestos e indenmizaciones, variaci6n de&#13;
retenciones o de vol(imenes y montos presupuestarios, etc. En caso de precios&#13;
provisionales y pagos por acopios se adjuntara la documentaci6n justificativa.&#13;
15.   Reclamos del Contratista. El consultor analizara de inmediato cada situaci6n&#13;
que pueda ocasionar un reclamo por el contratista, buscando la mejor soluci6n para el&#13;
proyecto dentro de los terminos contractuales. Mantendra informada a la SEOPC de los&#13;
reclamos que se presenten, adjuntando su opini6n tecnica y los efectos estimados en plazo&#13;
y calidad de obra. En general, todas las conciliaciones de reclamos y precios nuevos&#13;
debera aprobarlas la SEOPC, para lo cual el supervisor realizara las diligencias oportunas.&#13;
16.   Indicaciones al Contratista. A partir del acta de replanteo, el consultor debera&#13;
comunicar al contratista todas las 6rdenes y directrices, formatos de formularios, sistemas&#13;

ANEXO 6.2&#13;
REPUBLICA DOMINICANA&#13;
PROYECTO DE CARRETERAS NACIONALES&#13;
TtRMIOS DE REFERENCIA PARA LA ASISTENCiA TtCNICA A LA SEOPC EN LA&#13;
EJECUCI6N DEL SISTEMA DE ADMINISTRACI6N DE MANTENIMLIENTO DE CARRETERAS&#13;
(SAMC)&#13;
1.    Antecedentes. A finales de la decada de los setenta y durante toda la de los afios&#13;
ochenta, tuvieron lugar en la Repiiblica Dominicana algunas actuaciones tendentes a la&#13;
implantaci6n de un sistema de mantenimiento de la red nacional de carreteras. Con fondos&#13;
provenientes de los prestamos 1316-DO, 1784-DO y 2609-DO, respectivamente, se&#13;
diseft6 y fue adaptado a las caracteristicas del pais un sistema de Administraci6n del&#13;
Mantenimiento de Carreteras; pero, debido a problemas derivados del exceso de personal,&#13;
de la falta de apoyo institucional y de la desviaci6n de los recursos hacia la reconstrucci6n&#13;
y rehabilitaci6n de una red vial en estado sumamente deficiente, dicho sistema nunca pudo&#13;
ser institucionalizado y operativo.&#13;
2.    El abandono del mantenimiento redund6 en un todavia mayor deterioro de la red,&#13;
lo que oblig6 a rehabilitarla a traves de los prestamos citados y del prestamo 3350-DO,&#13;
acompafiados de un notable esfuerzo inversor del Gobiemo. Como resultado se estima&#13;
que 85% de la red de carreteras estara en buena o regular condici6n a finales de 1997.&#13;
3.    Como parte del prestamo 3350-DO, fue contratado un componente de asistencia&#13;
tecnica para la implantaci6n de un Sistema de Administraci6n del Mantenimiento de&#13;
Carreteras (SAMC) a nivel central y distrital, dada la necesidad de actualizar y poner en&#13;
practica un sistema practico y eficiente de conservaci6n, que permitiera salvaguardar el&#13;
patrimonio vial rehabilitado. El caracter innovador del sistema propuesto en esta ultima&#13;
asistencia tecnica radica en la (progresiva) contrataci6n del mantenimiento con empresas&#13;
privadas de gesti6n vial, permaneciendo en la entidad oficial las labores de planificaci6n y&#13;
atenci6n a emergencias, aparte de las obvias de fiscalizaci6n, normativa, tutela y&#13;
salvaguarda del dominio piublico vial (derecho de via).&#13;
4.    Sin embargo, quedan pendientes algunos trabajos para concluir la implantaci6n del&#13;
SAMC, entre otros la extensi6n del sistema a las ayudantias, la supervisi6n de los&#13;
contratos de mantenimiento rutinario, la incorporaci6n al sistema del mantenimiento&#13;
peri6dico, el desarrollo institucional y la transferencia de la metodologia a las empresas y&#13;
entidades del pais. Asimismo, sera necesario un apoyo especializado en mantenimiento&#13;
vial a la Oficina de Coordinaci6n del Proyecto (OCP).&#13;
5.    Objetivos. En concordancia con lo anterior, el objetivo fundamental de la nueva&#13;
Asistencia Tecnica es culminar la implantaci6n y evaluar el funcionamiento del (SAMC)&#13;
asi como asesorar a la OCP en las actividades de mantenimiento. El consultor debera&#13;
tambien elaborar las bases, normativas, legales, administrativas, organizativas y financieras&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
que permitan la creaci6n de un organismo descentralizado y muy particularmente, de su&#13;
fondo de financiamiento especializado, alimentado este a traves de cargos a los usuarios&#13;
de las carreteras, y prever un regimen transitorio apropiado.&#13;
6.    Alcance de la Asistencia Tecnica. Las principales tareas del consultor seran las&#13;
siguientes:&#13;
(a)   extensi6n del SAMC a las ayudantias; estudio y adaptaci6n del sistema&#13;
existente en la sede central y los distritos;&#13;
(b)   asesoria tematica a la OCP;&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
(a)   E;xtensi6n del SAMC a las Ayudantias. Estudio y adaptaci6n del sistema&#13;
existente en la sede central y los distritos, para examinar la adaptabilidad&#13;
del sistema previamente implantado a nivel central y distrital, analizando las&#13;
labores que deban ser descentralizadas y los recursos disponibles, humanos&#13;
y materiales. Tras ello, el consultor propondra a la SEOPC las tareas a&#13;
delegar en a las ayudantias, asi como las necesidades de todo tipo que&#13;
conllevara la puesta en marcha del sistema, con especial enfasis en el grado&#13;
de informatizaci6n y en los sistemas de comunicaci6n con el resto de&#13;
niveles del sistema. Sea cual sea el grado de tecnificaci6n inicialmente&#13;
previsto, se procurara que el sistema este lo mas adaptado posible (y, en&#13;
especial, que no presente contraindicaci6n alguna) a fin de su eventual y&#13;
fitura automatizaci6n.&#13;
(b)   Asesoria tematica a la OCP. Esta labor estara inscrita en el trabajo&#13;
conjunto de la OCP. El ingeniero vial coordinador de la asistencia tecnica&#13;
(o ingeniero vial en que este delegue, en tat caso con aprobaci6n de la&#13;
SEOPC) llevara a cabo la asesoria en materia de conservaci6n de carreteras&#13;
que requiera la OCP, durante el tiempo de duraci6n de este contrato.&#13;
(c)   EvaluaciOny revisi6n del SAMC. Supervisi6n de la actualizaci6n de los&#13;
inventarios viales, asi como de la aplicaci6n del SAMC en los distritos y en&#13;
el DPCC. Incluira todos los procesos de evaluaci6n del funcionamiento del&#13;
sistema existente, diagn6stico de posibles fallos o carencias, propuestas de&#13;
soluci6n y consiguiente modificaci6n y revisi6n. Asimismo, se tomaran en&#13;
cuenta los efectos derivados de las nuevas tecnologias viales implantadas.&#13;
Se supervisaran los trabajos que realicen la DGM o los contratistas de&#13;
gesti6n vial, en materia de actualizaci6n de inventarios y demas soportes&#13;
para la planificaci6n y programaci6n del mantenimiento. Esta supervisi6n&#13;
se hara extensiva a los trabajos de analisis de proyectos (mediante HDM u&#13;
otros instrumentos), asi como a los controles, protocolos y normativas&#13;
referentes a actividades de mantenimiento (ejecuci6n y calidad), cantidades,&#13;
rendimientos, costos y niveles de servicio.&#13;
(d)   Supervisi6n del mantenimiento por contrato. Los trabajos a desarrollar en&#13;
este apartado consistiran -dado su caracter de contratos piloto- en el apoyo&#13;
a la DGM y a las empresas de mantenimiento en la elaboraci6n de los&#13;
documentos y en el aporte de datos que permitan la adecuada realizaci6n&#13;
de las labores que se definen en los dos epigrafes subsiguientes. Se&#13;
revisaran los reportes de programaci6n mensual, semanal y diaria,&#13;
cumplimiento de objetivos y agenda de estado de los tramos contratados.&#13;
Se haran las propuestas pertinentes con el fin de obtener una informaci6n&#13;
adecuada, oportuna y fiable, enmarcada en el uso de unos recursos&#13;
materiales y temporales compatibles con la sostenibilidad del resto de&#13;
actividades.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
(e)   Auditoria Tecnica de los contratos de mantenimiento rutinario y peri6dico&#13;
y delproceso gradual de contrataci6n del mantenimiento; (terminos de&#13;
referencia en Anexo 11). Tomando como base la informaci6n antes&#13;
resefiada, el consultor establecera los mecanismos de auditoria&#13;
multidisciplinar sobre los contratos piloto de mantenimiento (rutinario y&#13;
peri6dico) en ejecuci6n, teniendo en cuenta los siguientes factores:&#13;
(i)    metodologiayprocedimientosgeneralesdeexamen: metodos&#13;
existentes, adaptaci6n futura y diseiio basico adoptados; normativa&#13;
y recomendaciones de los organismos nacionales e internacionales,&#13;
asi como de la buena practica constructiva; metodologia de toma de&#13;
datos de campo y de extrapolaci6n e identificaci6n de tramos o&#13;
trabajos homogeneos;&#13;
(ii)   preparaci6n y ejecuci6n de las unidades de obra y servicios de&#13;
mantenimiento: procedencia de los materiales y equipos, tanto&#13;
desde el punto de vista de su idoneidad tecnica como del analisis&#13;
comparativo de sus costos y rendimientos; examen de las&#13;
estructuras, organizaci6n, control intemo, capacitaci6n y&#13;
funcionamiento de las entidades y empresas implicadas o&#13;
precalificadas; planes de control de calidad; niveles de servicio&#13;
obtenidos;&#13;
(iii)  impacto ambiental de las actuaciones: unidades de obra,&#13;
extracci6n y dep6sito de materiales, fabricaci6n de agregados y&#13;
aglomerados, vertidos, instalaciones o desvios provisionales,&#13;
accidentes. Se tendran en cuenta los procedimientos de evaluaci6n&#13;
de impactos, con especial enfasis en la evaluaci6n tematica (paisaje,&#13;
geomorfologia, regulaci6n hidrica, suelos, hidrologia, vegetaci6n,&#13;
fauna, usuarios, accesibilidad, aspectos socioecon6micos), la&#13;
identificaci6n de impactos y sus relaciones causa-efecto, y Ia&#13;
propuesta de introducci6n de las medidas preventivas y correctoras&#13;
correspondientes;&#13;
(iv)   seguimiento de los contratos: sanciones, aparici6n de incidencias,&#13;
retrasos, incremento de cantidades y costos unitarios, modificaci6n&#13;
de las soluciones tecnicas o cambio de los sistemas de ejecuci6n&#13;
respecto de los previstos, reducciones o ampliaciones del ambito&#13;
fisico de intervenci6n. Identificaci6n de relaciones causa-efecto;&#13;
prognosis y escenario de finalizaci6n de aquellos que se hallen en&#13;
ejecuci6n; seguridad e higiene en el trabajo; evaluaci6n de la calidad&#13;
final; evaluaci6n del equipo de direcci6n del contrato;&#13;
(v)   estandarizaci6n de resultadosy elaboraci6n de indices&#13;
comparativos: establecimiento de indicadores econ6micos (costes&#13;
de administraci6n o supervisi6n, costes por kil6metro de cada&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-89 -&#13;
actividad, normas de cantidad, totalizaci6n de los costes de&#13;
mantenimiento para cada tipo de red, rentabilidad obtenida), de&#13;
contingencias (siniestralidad, retrasos en obras, en servicios y en&#13;
direcci6n o control de calidad, incrementos en costes, aparici6n de&#13;
imprevistos) y estadisticos (km. o nuimero de unidades tratadas,&#13;
construidas o en ejecuci6n -y comparaci6n con las previstas- para&#13;
los diferentes contratos y programas, longitudes y porcentajes de&#13;
red incluidas en los mismos, inversiones correspondientes);&#13;
(vi)  informe de conclusiones sobre cumplimiento de objetivos,&#13;
anomalias o carencias de todo tipo y ambito observadas, y&#13;
propuestas preventivas o correctoras a considerar: opini6n del&#13;
equipo auditor sobre el proceso, comparativamente con otros en&#13;
que haya intervenido; perfiles caracteristicos del pais;&#13;
recomendaciones y estandares a utilizar en el futuro; y&#13;
(vii)  anexos e informaciones complementarias de todo tipo que el&#13;
equipo auditor estime oportunos.&#13;
Ademas, tomando como base los informes de auditoria de los contratos en&#13;
ejecucion y el analisis de la progresiva puesta en marcha del SAMC, el consultor&#13;
efectuarh sucesivas revisiones de los tramos de carretera a incluir en los contratos&#13;
piloto de mantenimiento -tanto rutinario como peri6dico- previamente&#13;
seleccionados, a la luz de la nueva programaci6n, asi como del conocimiento mas&#13;
especifico de otros componentes y actuaciones viales de la SEOPC. Las variables&#13;
de selecci6n no seran unicamente las territoriales y socioecon6micas usualmente&#13;
empleadas en las tecnicas de analisis de proyectos, planificaci6n y ordenaci6n&#13;
territorial, sino que ademas se tendran en cuenta -dado su caracter de experiencia&#13;
piloto- otros criterios de reparto por distritos, de adaptaci6n a las disponibilidad de&#13;
materiales y medios de las empresas locales, asi como de coordinaci6n con los&#13;
restantes programas que se Ilevan a cabo en la red vial nacional (obras previstas o&#13;
en curso, continuidad de tramos, transferencia de tecnologia vial, aspectos&#13;
medioambientales, etc.).&#13;
El consultor extendera asimismo el informe de auditoria a las rehabilitaciones de&#13;
tramos y refuerzos de pavimentos que, sin formar parte de los contratos piloto,&#13;
sean expresamente sefialados por la SEOPC.&#13;
Para las sucesivas contrataciones del mantenimiento (tanto rutinario como&#13;
peri6dico) que vayan a tener lugar, el consultor revisara, adaptari y pondra al dia&#13;
las bases y restantes documentos de licitaci6n. Asimismo, el consultor disefiara y&#13;
propondra a la SEOPC un modelo de contrato de conservaci6n integral, en el cual&#13;
el adjudicatario se haga cargo simultaneamente del mantenimiento rutinario y del&#13;
mantenimiento peri6dico de un conjunto o lote de tramos.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
(f)    Transferencia de metodologia y sistematica del mantenimiento a las&#13;
empresas de gestion vial y evaluaci6n continua de las empresas&#13;
precalificadaspara contratar. Este apartado se refiere a las labores de&#13;
formaci6n y entrenamiento del personal de las empresas de gesti6n vial que&#13;
esten interviniendo en los contratos de mantenimiento, o bien que, sin ser&#13;
adjudicatarias de ninguno de los lotes, se hallen precalificadas para ello&#13;
conforme a las bases y demas documentos de licitaci6n. El objeto de esta&#13;
capacitaci6n sera la familiarizaci6n con los soportes y flujos de informaci6n&#13;
que demanda el buen funcionamiento del sistema, asi como la estructura y&#13;
funcionamiento recomendados para su correcta y puntual ejecuci6n. La&#13;
formaci6n se llevara a cabo de un modo continuo, acompasando la puesta&#13;
en marcha de los distintos componentes del SAMC a los progresos&#13;
capacitativos del personal involucrado, a traves de un analisis global de su&#13;
funcionamiento. El consultor, en sus informes, indicara expresamente las&#13;
incidencias del proceso formativo en cada una de las empresas,&#13;
proponiendo las variaciones que estime oportunas en su calificaci6n.&#13;
(g)   Programa de continuaci6n de la capacitaci6n de los recursos humanos,&#13;
potencialmente intervinientes en elproceso, incluyendo programas&#13;
especificos (tecnicos y universitarios) de forrnaci6n, asi como&#13;
fortalecimiento de la escala y carrera administrativas. El consultor,&#13;
partiendo del conocimiento de las carencias formativas (en la&#13;
Administraci6n y en la empresa) como consecuencia de los trabajos de&#13;
apartados anteriores y en previsi6n del incremento de necesidades de&#13;
personal especializado, fruto del plan progresivo de mantenimiento por&#13;
contrato 1996-200 1, propondra !a extensi6n de las actividades de&#13;
formaci6n especifica en la materia, mediante la coordinaci6n con los&#13;
organismos apropiados, materializando para ello planes academicos o de&#13;
progresi6n en la escala administrativa, incluyendo la definici6n curricular y&#13;
la confecci6n de los recursos didacticos.&#13;
(h)   Propuesta metodol6gicay supervisi6n de la asignacion de los equiposy&#13;
maquinaria de la SEOPC; contratos de cesi6n de equipos a las compaflias&#13;
adjudicatarias del mantenimiento. El consultor estudiara y determinara, de&#13;
modo coordinado con las necesidades que la DGM fije para los caminos&#13;
vecinales, los excedentes de equipos pesados y maquinaria que existan o se&#13;
prevea puedan existir en el futuro, como consecuencia del proceso de&#13;
contrataci6n extema del mantenimiento, asi como de su natural&#13;
envejecimiento. Propondra el metodo y secuencia de la reconversion de la&#13;
flota, y supervisara tal proceso: para ello, considerara y ponderara las&#13;
diferentes alternativas que se ofrezcan y, caso de optar total o parcialmente&#13;
por la cesi6n de equipos a las empresas de gesti6n vial, el consultor elevara&#13;
a la SEOPC los documertos y contratos en que se pueda basar dicha&#13;
cesi6n. Una vez puesta en marcha la reconversi6n, evaluara su desarrollo,&#13;
indicando en sus informes las carencias o desviaciones detectadas, asi como&#13;
las recomendaciones para su soluci6n.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
(i)    Asesoria en la ejecuci6n de las labores de vigilancia especificay&#13;
ordenaci6n del dominiopublico vial. La defensa y salvaguarda del&#13;
derecho de via (dominio publico) es un componente del SAMC a&#13;
permanecer dentro de las competencias y funciones ejecutivas directas de la&#13;
Administraci6n de Carreteras, regulado por la Ley N° 1474, de 22 de&#13;
febrero de 1938, modificada mediante disposici6n de 22 de mayo de 1965.&#13;
Con el fin de obtener una gesti6n adecuada del citado dominio puiblico vial,&#13;
la consultora asesorara a la SEOPC y presentara al efecto una propuesta&#13;
organizativa y funcional para la correcta ejecuci6n de las labores de&#13;
vigilancia, resoluci6n de incidencias y regimen sancionador&#13;
correspondientes.&#13;
(j)    Evaluaci6n de losprocesos de reforma institucional. Establecimiento del&#13;
Organismo de Mantenimiento Vial y el Fondo Vial. El consultor asistiri a&#13;
la SEOPC en el establecimiento del Fondo Vial y en la creaci6n de un&#13;
organismo de Mantenimiento Vial y elaborara un proyecto de Estatuto de&#13;
Conservaci6n basado fundamentalmente en los mecanismos de informaci6n&#13;
y participaci6n piiblicas, y en la transparencia de la gesti6n. Detallara&#13;
asimismo el grado de autonomia administrativa propuesto, su sujeci6n al&#13;

creaci6n de la Direcci6n General de Transito Terrestre (DGTT), dentro de la Secretaria de&#13;
Estado de Obras Piublicas y Comunicaciones (SEOPC), que perdur6 hasta finales de 1982.&#13;
El sistema, aunque manual, era, dentro de sus limitaciones, bastante completo y permitia&#13;
identificar los puntos criticos en cada via o intersecci6n a travis de la medici6n de&#13;
diferentes indicadores de peligrosidad, mortandad, severidad, etc. y permitia hacer&#13;
clasificaciones por sexos y grupos de edades de los usuarios, edad y tipo del parque, etc.&#13;
2.    En forma grafica, el sistema vial principal de carreteras y las redes urbanas de las&#13;
ciudades de Santo Domingo y Santiago eran representados por mapas con alfileres de&#13;
cabezas coloreadas seg6n tipos y severidad de los accidentes en los puntos d6nde estos se&#13;
producian, tomandose al fin de cada aflo una foto de transparencia. La DGTT lleg6 a&#13;
tener una secuencia de mis de diez aflos que mostraba la evoluci6n de los puntos criticos y&#13;
la respuesta a las medida correctivas que se tomaron. Desgraciadamente, la mayor parte&#13;
de los trabajos tecnicos de la DGTT se fueron relegando a un segundo plano o&#13;
desatendidos totalmente a partir de 1982, desapareciendo casi totalmente esta y otras&#13;
bases de datos que alli se originaban.&#13;
3.    El sistema de accidentes que manejaba la DGTT, tenia su base en un fcrmulario,&#13;
adaptado del sistema de registro de accidentes de Puerto Rico. El formulario, comprendia&#13;
dos grandes secciones: (a) descripci6n del lugar (vias), del ambiente (clima, visibilidad,&#13;
etc.), de los vehiculos (tipos, edades, estado mecanico aparente, etc.), de los protagonistas&#13;
y su status (edades, sexos, sobriedad, legalidad, etc.), resultados del accidente (heridos,&#13;
muertos, dafios a la propiedad, a terceros, etc.) y otros detalles; y b) un croquis con&#13;
convenciones que permitia visualizar el accidente completo, incluyendo: trayectorias antes&#13;
y despues de las colisiones, tipo de las colisiones, obstaculos o desperfectos de las vias,&#13;
etc.&#13;
4.    El formulario era llenado por la policia de trinsito y una copia del mismo era&#13;
remitida a la DGTT para su analisis. Los tecnicos de la Secci6n de Analisis de Accidentes&#13;
de la DGTT a su vez, mantenian un sistema de entrenamiento, en la aplicaci6n de la Ley&#13;
de Transito y el registro de accidentes, para nuevos policias que entraban al servicio de&#13;
transito, asi como frecuentes conferencias y seminarios de actualizaci6n para los jefes de&#13;
unidades del servicio policial de transito.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
5.    Objetivo y Alcance de la Asistencia Tecnica. En general, la asistencia tecnica&#13;
debera sentar las bases para la restauraci6n en la DGTT y la Policia Nacional (Policia de&#13;
Transito Urbano, y Policia de Carreteras) de un sistema de Registro y Andlisis de&#13;
Accidentes Viales (RAA V), teniendo en cuenta que gran parte de los componentes que una&#13;
vez existieron, explicados en los antecedentes, ya no existen, incluyendo la capacidad&#13;
tecnica que habra que reinstalar.&#13;
6.    Dado que, en la policia de transito, el nivel de calificaci6n ha disminuido en&#13;
relaci6n con la mostrada en el pasado y que la Secci6n de Analisis de Accidentes de la&#13;
DGTT no opera y habra que reclutar y preparar de nuevo a sus componentes, se sugiere&#13;
que la informaci6n recolectada este adaptada para trabajar con subconjuntos de&#13;
informaci6n basica o simplificada, asi como los planes de capacitaci6n, tanto policial como&#13;
tecnica para que, en ulteriores etapas, se complete el sistema por tecnicos entrenados.&#13;
7.    El sistema tendria unaprimera etapa que tendria en cuenta las restricciones de&#13;
calificaciones del personal de registros de accidentes y que daria lugar a una simplificaci6n&#13;
del formulario de registro a ser aplicado. No obstante, el sistema durante esta primera&#13;
etapa deberia ser suficiente para medir los principales indicadores de severidad y&#13;
peligrosidad de los accidentes, asi como para preparar los mapas de accidentes.&#13;
8.    El Consultor deberi dejar preparada la evoluci6n del sistema (etapa o etapas&#13;
siguientes, si son necesarias) de forma que los principales tecnicos (contrapartes) que se&#13;
capaciten puedan implantarlas en funci6n de un programa basado en metas a alcanzar&#13;
dentro de cada etapa.&#13;
9.    Por otra parte, el sistema de base de datos y de procesamiento que instale el&#13;
Consultor, debera quedar lo mas completo posible, vale decir: que pu.eda operar en&#13;
cualquiera de la etapas, ya que lo que se limita en las etapas de implatitaci6n es s6lo la&#13;
cantidad de informaci6n de q,ie se dispone y, por tanto, los indicadores de salida&#13;
(resultados del analisis) en cada etapa seran aquellos para los que la base de datos tiene&#13;
informaci6n registrada.&#13;
10.   Seri tambien tarea del Consultor dejar p'reparado lo siguiente: (a) guia para el&#13;
ilenado del registro de accidentes; (b) manual de operaci6n de la base de datos; (c) manual&#13;
de analisis de accidentes; y (d) guia para el calculo de costos de accidentes viales en la&#13;
Republica Dominicana. Tambien debera dejar sus recomendaciones al respecto de: (a)&#13;
organismos que intervienen, organizaci6n y su evoluci6n dentro del sistema por etapas; (b)&#13;
reformas legales (si fueren necesarias); y (c) analisis del sistema de multas y cargos penales&#13;
involucrados en los 'accidentes y recomendaciones sobre sus niveles.&#13;
11.   Servicios Profesionales. La Asistencia Tecnica requerira los servicios tecnicos&#13;
de:&#13;
(a)    Un experto internacional, Ingeniero de Transito  ..........    8 meses&#13;
(b)   Un asistente local, Ingeniero de Transito .....................    6 meses&#13;

REPUBLICA DOMINICANA&#13;
PROYECTO DE CARRETERAS NACIONALES&#13;
TIRMINOS DE REFERENciA PARA LA CONTRATACI6N DE SERVICIOS DE CONSULTORIA&#13;
PARA LA ELABORACI6N DE UN PLAN DE INVERSIONES DEL SECTOR TRANSPORTE&#13;
1.    Antecedentes. En 1976, con financiamiento del Banco Interamericano de&#13;
Desarrollo, se llev6 a efecto el primer estudio del sector transporte que se denomin6&#13;
Estudio Tecnico-Econ6mico del Sector Transporte y que debiera servir de base a&#13;
ulteriores programas de inversiones en el sector. Mas tarde, en 1989, el Banco Mundial&#13;
financi6 un programa que se denomin6: Asistencia Tecnicapara Implantar un Sistema de&#13;
Planificaci6nyAdministraci6n del Transporte. En ambos casos, los resultados obtenidos&#13;
fueron casi identicos, ambos resultaron ser utiles instrumentos de diagn6stico y de&#13;
identificaci6n de proyectos a nivel de perfiles. Sin embargo, para obtener planes concretos&#13;
hubo, en cada caso, la necesidad de contratar consultoria adicional que completara los&#13;
analisis tanto en los casos de preparaci6n de los prestamos 1784-DO (1976-1978) y 2609-&#13;
DO (1982-1984) como en el del prestamo 3350-DO (1988-1990).&#13;
2.    En terminos de planificaci6n, la SEOPC oferta en la actualidad un buen soporte&#13;
que puede servir de guia al Consultor para producir planes concretos en las ireas de&#13;
infraestructura del sector, tales como: carreteras, caminos vecinales, puertos y&#13;
aeropuertos. En el irea de servicios (explotaci6n), como el transporte urbano, se cuenta&#13;
con los planes preparados por el Estudio de Transporte Urbano financiado a trav6s del&#13;
prestamo 3350-DO. La capacidad instalada para la planificaci6n de la explotaci6n del&#13;
transporte aereo, maritimo, y de carga y pasajeros por carreteras es casi nula y es poco lo&#13;
que, por el momento, puede hacerse sin recurrir a la utilizaci6n de costosas encuestas y&#13;
estudios para definir los parametros que definen cada una de estas areas.&#13;
3.    Alcance de la Asistencia Tecnica. Como consecuencia de lo anteriormente&#13;
dicho, el alcance de estos Terminos de Referencia (TDR), abarca, pero no se limita a, la&#13;
programaci6n, al menos para cinco afSos, de proyectos de mejoramiento infraestructural o&#13;
de nuevos proyectos analizados tecnica y econ6micamente a nivel de prefactibilidad.&#13;
4.    De algunos de los posibles proyectos, la SEOPC, sus tecnicos y los consultores&#13;
contratados, ya tienen perfiles y/o la informaci6n basica para su analisis, o bien la SEOPC&#13;
podra producirla con la guia del Consultor.&#13;
5.    Para el subsector vialidad (carreteras y caminos vecinales) el Consultor contara&#13;
con el apoyo de: (a) Direcci6n General de Mantenimiento de Carreteras y Caminos&#13;
Vecinales (DGMCCV), y (b) Departamento de Administraci6n y Estudios de Pavimentos&#13;
(DAEP) de la Direcci6n General de Programaci6n de Inversiones (DGPI), que manejan&#13;
los inventarios y los modelos de planificacion econ6mica HDM aplicable preferentemente&#13;
a carreteras y Rural Road Model (RRM) aplicable s6lo a caminos rurales.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110-&#13;
6.    Con menor cantidad de herramientas de analisis a su disposici6n, el Departamento&#13;
de Muelles y Puertos de la SEOPC puede auxiliar y ser util en la programaci6n de las&#13;
inversiones del subsector. En el caso del subsector de aeropuertos, el Consultor debera&#13;
identificar y evaluar las posibilidades de proyectos en funci6n de ayudas prestadas por&#13;
organizaciones localizadas fuera de la SEOPC, como son: (a) la Direcci6n General de&#13;
Aeronautica Civil, (b) la Junta de Aeronautica Civil y (c) la Oficina Nacional de&#13;
Planificaci6n (ONAPLAN).&#13;
7.    Servicios Profesionales. Se requeriran servicios profesionales por un total de 10&#13;
hombres-meses divididos de la siguiente forma:&#13;
Experto a cargo del programa de carreteras y caminos vecinales (2000-2004)    4 meses&#13;
Experto a cargo del programa de puertos (2000-2004)                3 meses&#13;
Experto a cargo del programa de aeropuertos (2000-2004)            2 meses&#13;
Experto a cargo de integraci6n y planes de financiamniento         1 meses&#13;
Total                                                      10 meses&#13;
(Nota: La divisi6n de los tiempos y los tipos de expertos pueden ser carnbiados por el Consultor&#13;
siempre que lo propuesto cumpla con el alcance requerido).&#13;
8.    Contrapartida. La SEOPC dispondra la contrapartida correspondiente y que, en&#13;
principio, se concreta en el apoyo del personal de la SEOPC para:&#13;
(a)    Realizaci6n de Inventarios y Obtenci6n de Informaciones.&#13;
(b)    Predisefios Viales.&#13;
(c)    Analisis de Costos de Obras Civiles.&#13;
(d)   Analisis Econ6mico con el HDM o con el RRM.&#13;
Se nombrara tambien un enlace interinstitucional para que sirva de intermediario en las&#13;
visitas y obtencion de informaciones que se producen en otras instituciones. Esta persona&#13;
tendra el apoyo superior de la SEOPC para facilitar al maximo su trabajo.&#13;

REPUBLICA DOMNCANA&#13;
PROYECrO DE CARRETERAS NACIONALES&#13;
TtRMNOS DE REFERENCLA PARA LA ASISTENCTA TECNICA A LA SEOPC EN EL&#13;
DESARROLLO DEL PLAN DIRECrOR DE DRENAJE PLUVIAL Y SANEAMIENTO DE AGUAS&#13;
DE SANTO DoMINGo.&#13;
Antecedentes.&#13;
1.1   Saneamiento de aguas. La infraestructura sanitaria relativa a la red de&#13;
drenaje y evacuaci6n de aguas residuales de la ciudad de Santo Domingo alcanza&#13;
s6lo a un 27% de la poblaci6n. La red esta formada por grupos independientes, es&#13;
decir sin soluci6n de continuidad, vertiendo cada una de estas unidades&#13;
aisladamente, y quedando extensas areas de la ciudad sin servicio, tanto en zonas&#13;
de alto nivel econ6mico como de clase media o baja. En la mayoria de los casos,&#13;
el vertido se hace directamente al medio receptor sin tratamiento previo, bien a los&#13;
rios del ambito metropolitano (Haina, Isabela y Ozama) o bien al mar Caribe, que&#13;
configura el limite meridional de la ciudad. Estos vertidos -junto con otros&#13;
factores- han provocado un grave problema de contaminaci6n en dichas aguas,&#13;
situaci6n que debe ser modificada con la maxima urgencia para evitar la total&#13;
degradaci6n de la zona, con sus obvias consecuencias sobre el futuro econ6mico&#13;
del pais y el bienestar de sus habitantes, cuyo desarrollo esta basado en una fuerte&#13;
dependencia de los ingresos por turismo.&#13;
1.2   Drenaje pluvial. En relacion al drenaje de las aguas pluviales, el sistema de&#13;
alcantarillado pluvial consta de unos 136 km. de alcantarillas y casi 5,000&#13;
imbomales, que desaguan la aportaci6n de una superficie de s6lo 2.225 Ha, o sea&#13;
algo mas de un 10% de las 22,000 Ha que ocupa Santo Domingo. Existen muchas&#13;
conexiones ilegales de vertidos industriales y domesticos a la red de colectores&#13;
pluviales, que sera necesario caracterizar y, en alguin caso, eliminar. Hay zonas&#13;
que, sin disponer de red de drenaje pluvial, evacuan las escorrentias por infiltraci6n&#13;
en el subsuelo o mediante fosas areneras de almacenamiento y pozos filtrantes. La&#13;
permeabilidad de estas soluciones provisionales es muy baja, lo que da lugar a&#13;
tiempos de drenaje elevados, con las perniciosas consecuencias que la&#13;
sobreelevaci6n de la limina de agua conlleva, tanto sobre los bienes inundados&#13;
como, de un modo mis transitorio pero muy perceptible en este caso, sobre la&#13;
circulaci6n de vehiculos y peatones. Diversos puntos de avenidas principales, con&#13;
cuatro o mas carriles de circulaci6n, se hacen impracticables durante horas (e&#13;
incluso dias), con los correspondientes colapsos circulatorios. Todos los sectores&#13;
sociales y econ6micos han destacado la extrema urgencia y maxima prioridad de&#13;
resoluci6n de dicho problema.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112-&#13;
1.3   Planeamiento. El Ayuntamiento de Santo Domingo (ADN) elabor6, en&#13;
mayo de 1993, dentro del "Programa de reestructuraci6n y crecimiento de la&#13;
Ciudad de Santo Domingo y el Distrito Nacional", un estudio sobre la calidad de&#13;
las aguas superficiales, en el ambito de unos acuerdos de cooperaci6n tecnica&#13;
establecidos entre los Gobiemos de la Repiublica Dominicana e Italia. El citado&#13;
estudio, en el que se examinan las caracteristicas de los vertidos, asi como el&#13;
estado actual de la calidad de las aguas y de las infraestructuras sanitarias&#13;
existentes en la ciudad de Santo Domingo y en el Distrito Nacional, no Ilega&#13;
proponer una soluci6n concreta al problema. Por otra parte, el prestamo 3350-DO&#13;
financia un Estudio de Transporte Urbano en el que se contempla una&#13;
remodelaci6n de las principales avenidas y vias de comunicaci6n, que es preciso&#13;
desarrollar de modo coordinado y simultaneo con el Plan Director de Drenaje y&#13;
Saneamiento Urbano.&#13;
2.    Objetivos. El objetivo general de esta asistencia tecnica es preparar el Plan&#13;
Director de Drenaje Pluvial y Saneamiento de Aguas de Santo Domingo y su area&#13;
metropolitana.&#13;
3.    Ambito fisico y temporal. El ambito fisico del estudio se fija, de un modo&#13;
preliminar, en el area limitada al oeste por el rio Haina, at este por el meridiano de longitud&#13;
69 grados 40 minutos oeste (que pasa por el Aeropuerto Internacional de Las Americas -&#13;
AILA), al norte por la caniada Guzman, el rio Manzano y el rio Isabela, y al sur por el mar&#13;
Caribe. El ambito temporal o aflo horizonte del estudio debera ser fijado por cada&#13;
licitador, en funci6n de la propuesta especifica que presente, que debera concretar las&#13;
etapas necesarias, asi como la asignaci6n temporal y financiera a cada etapa.&#13;
4.    Alcance de la Asistencia Tecnica. Las principales tareas a realizar mediante esta&#13;
asistencia tecnica son:&#13;
(a)   Estudiar las caracteristicas fisicas de la zona.&#13;
(b)   Revisar los datos disponibles de las redes de saneamiento de aguas&#13;
pluviales como de aguas negras, actualizando el inventario de las&#13;
infraestructuras existentes.&#13;
(c)   Determinar las cuencas urbanas vertientes que formaran los principales ejes&#13;
drenantes del area metropolitana.&#13;
(d)   Estudiar para cada cuenca, el tipo de urbanizaci6n existente y la previsi6n&#13;
de crecimiento seguin los planes de ordenaci6n territorial existentes o sus&#13;
expectativas de desarrollo (industrial, habitacional, sanitario, de servicios,&#13;
etc.) en funci6n del entorno actual.&#13;
(e)   Estudiar, para cada cuenca y sector, la poblaci6n asentada y la maxima&#13;
ocupaci6n posible en el futuro.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
(f)    Estudiar el consumo por persona y dia en la situaci6n actual, de acuerdo&#13;
con el tipo de poblaci6n asentado en cada cuenca, asi como su previsible&#13;
crecimiento con la mejora de las condiciones de vida.&#13;
(g)   Estudiar el regimen de lluvias para determinar la intensidad de calculo y las&#13;
restantes magnitudes de la precipitaci6n.&#13;
(h)   Estudiar, en funci6n del tipo de urbanizaci6n, los coeficientes de escorrenia&#13;
que deberan tenerse en cuenta para cada cuenca y sector, asi como sus&#13;
tiempos de concentraci6n.&#13;
(i)    Plantear y elegir, en cada caso y de acuerdo con las circunstancias&#13;
especiales de cada zona, la posibilidad de implantar una iinica red unitaria&#13;
de saneamiento o bien plantear redes separativas, en funci6n del punto de&#13;

5.    Trabajos a Efectuar. Los distintos trabajos a efectuar se detallan a continuaci6n,&#13;
atendiendo a la ordenaci6n expresada anteriormente.&#13;
5.1   Estudiar las caracteristicasfisicas de la zona. La primera labor consistira&#13;
en la obtenci6n de los datos orograficos y geotecnicos del area metropolitana para&#13;
proponer, con pleno conocimiento, la mejor soluci6n posible para la implantacion&#13;
de una red de drenaje. En relaci6n a la cartografia de trabajo, se deberan obtener&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114-&#13;
pianos generales a E/ 1:25.000 y E/ 1:10.000 y, para el desarrollo de estudios mas&#13;
detallados, planos generales a escala 1:5.000 con curvas de nivel cada 5 m y planos&#13;
de detalle a escala 1:2.000 con curvas de nivel cada 2 mn, con profusi6n de cotas en&#13;
las zonas urbanas. Dicha informaci6n debera ser recogida en soporte grafico y&#13;
magnetico para su posterior tratamiento. Asimismo se recopilara la informaci6n&#13;
existente para confeccionar un plano geotecnico a E: 1/50.000 de toda el area&#13;
metropolitana, acompafiado de una memoria explicativa de las caracteristicas del&#13;
subsuelo de cada sector.&#13;
5.2   Revisar los datos disponibles de las redes de Saneamiento de aguas&#13;
pluviales como de aguas negras, actualizando el inventario de las&#13;
infraestructuras existentes. El segundo trabajo consistira en la revisi6n del&#13;
inventariado de la red existente actualizandolo y localizando, por coordenadas, la&#13;
situaci6n de registros e imbomales. Dicha informaci6n debera trasladarse a la&#13;
cartografia digitalizada a E 1/.2000, incluyendo caracteristicas de los colectores,&#13;
sentido de las aguas, puntos de vertido, etc., confeccionando, si es necesario,&#13;
croquis de aquellos registros en los que confluyan diversos colectores que no&#13;
puedan reflejarse c6modamente en los planos generales. Se realizari asimismo un&#13;
inventario completo de los puntos de vertido a los rios Ozama e Isabela y al mar&#13;
Caribe. Se estudiari la capacidad de la red existente y se realizara una prognosis&#13;
del estado de la misma, con el fin de determinar la parte de la red que es suficiente,&#13;
la que debe remodelarse y la que se puede aprovechar, segun sean los&#13;
planteamientos del Plan Director para la situaci6n futura. Finalmente, deberin&#13;
inventariarse las infraestructuras mas importantes situadas en el subsuelo urbano,&#13;
que puedan condicionar el trazado de los colectores a proyectar. Tambien debera&#13;
establecerse un plan de mantenimiento y explotaci6n de la actual red de&#13;
alcantarillado de acuerdo con los recursos disponibles.&#13;
5.3   Determinar las cuencas urbanas vertientes que formaran los principales&#13;
ejes drenantes del area metropolitana. El tercer trabajo supone la definici6n de&#13;
una posible red, dividiendo el territorio basicamente en funci6n de su orografia, en&#13;
diversas cuencas, que se estudiarAn independientes unas de otras, siendo esta&#13;
zonificaci6n la unidad de trabajo para el desarrollo del Plan Director.&#13;
5.4   Estudiar para cada cuenca, el tipo de urbanizacidn existente y la&#13;
previsi6n de crecimiento segiun los planes de ordenaci6n territorial existentes, o&#13;
sus expectativas de desarrollo (industrial, habitacional, sanitario, de servicios,&#13;
etc.) enfunci6n del entorno actual. La cuarta tarea estribara en deternminar, para&#13;
cada unidad de zonificaci6n, y teniendo en cuenta los planes de urbanizaci6n&#13;
desarrollados o propuestos -si los hay-, y la estimaci6n de crecimiento del sector o&#13;
cuenca de acuerdo con el tipo de urbanizaci6n existente, la previsi6n de la maxima&#13;
ocupaci6n fuitura de cada cuenca. Debera compararse el censo actual con la&#13;
maxima ocupaci6n prevista para conocer, de acuerdo con las tasas de crecimiento&#13;
actuales, cual sera el affo horizonte de total ocupaci6n del terreno del area&#13;
metropolitana.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
5.5   Estudiar, para cada cuencay sector, la poblaci6n asentaday la m&amp;dxma&#13;
ocupaci6n posible en elfuturo. El quinto trabajo consistiri en estudiar para cada&#13;
unidad de zonificaci6n la poblaci6n asentada actualmente, teniendo en cuenta el&#13;
tipo de urbanizaci6n o uso del suelo existente. La suma de las poblaciones de&#13;
todas las cuencas debera coincidir con el censo de la poblaci6n. La prognosis de la&#13;
poblaci6n en el afio horizonte debera hacerse con base en la metodologia&#13;
apropiada.&#13;
5.6   Estudiar el consumo por persona y dia en la situaci6n actual, de acuerdo&#13;
con el tipo de poblaci6n asentado en cada cuenca, asi como su previsible&#13;
crecimiento con la mejora de las condiciones de vida. El sexto trabajo consistira&#13;
en conocer, a traves de los servicios de abastecimiento, el consumo de agua diario&#13;
por habitante. Debera diferenciarse la tasa de consumo por habitante, segun las&#13;
caracteristicas de las viviendas de cada sector, por uso dom6stico, industrial o de&#13;
servicios, y su estimaci6n en un futuro, considerando el afio horizonte y el&#13;
incremento de dotaci6n como resultado del analisis de aumento de la demanda de&#13;
los uItimos afios. Para completar el estudio de caudales de aguas residuales&#13;
generados, se considerara el consumo no domestico seguin el tipo de industria o&#13;
servicio existente en cada zona y el consumo relativo por unidad de producci6n.&#13;
5.7   Estudiar el regimen de lluvias para determinar la intensidad de cdlculo y&#13;
las restantes magnitudes de la precipitaci6n. La septima tarea consistiri en&#13;
analizar el regimen de lluvias de Santo Domingo, para conocer la m(axima&#13;
intensidad del chaparr6n en funci6n del tiempo de duraci6n y la periodicidad del&#13;
mismo, y en determinar, conjuntamente con la Direcci6n T6cnica del Plan, el&#13;
periodo de recurrencia que deberi considerarse en las distintas cuencas, teniendo&#13;
en cuenta los riesgos que puedan asumnirse, en casos de inundaciones, cuando se&#13;
producen lluvias de intensidad superior a las del periodo de recurrencia adoptado.&#13;
5.8   Estudiar, en funcion del tipo de urbanizaci6n, los coeficientes de&#13;
escorrentia que deberdn tenerse en cuenta para cada cuencay sector, asi como&#13;
sus tiempos de concentraci6n. El octavo cometido sera evaluar, en funci6n de las&#13;
caracteristicas del terreno, pendiente, tipo de suelo, etc., el coeficiente de&#13;
escorrentia de cada zona. Debera preverse en un fuituro una mayor&#13;
impermeabilizaci6n del terreno a medida que se extienda la superficie construida.&#13;
Se determinaran los parametros de disenio (tiempos de concentraci6n, caudales&#13;
punta, carga de sedimentos, etc.) para cada una de las unidades de zonificaci6n.&#13;
5.9   Plantear y elegir, en cada caso y de acuerdo con las circunstancias&#13;
especiales de cada zona, las alternativas de implantar una tunica red unitaria de&#13;
saneamiento o bien plantear redes separativas, enfuncion delpunto de destino de&#13;
las aguas pluvialesy negras. La novena tarea sera decidir para cada cuenca, a la&#13;
vista de los datos obtenidos, el tipo de red de drenaje a proyectar. Se estudiaran&#13;
obligatoriamente las opciones de red unitaria y red separativa. Las aguas pluviales&#13;
deben ser evacuadas lo mas rapidamente posible a los cauces receptores o al mar,&#13;
tomando el camino mas directo, y los destinos de las aguas residuales seran las&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116-&#13;
estaciones depuradoras. Los colectores unitarios o los de aguas negras -caso de&#13;
sistema separativo-, antes de desembocar al exterior, deberan ser conectados al&#13;
interceptor general que recoja las aguas residuales y las conduzca a la respectiva&#13;
depuradora, evitando asi su vertido directo al entorno. En tiempo liuvioso, cuando&#13;
-para el caso de sistema unitario- por los colectores desciendan conjuntamente&#13;
aguas pluviales y residuales, la interceptaci6n de estas uiltimas debera hacerse con&#13;
un grado de diluci6n igual o superior a cinco, para evitar lexiviados demasiado&#13;
contaminados.&#13;
5.10  Diseiar el esquema de la red de colectores, teniendo en cuenta la red&#13;
existente, incluyendo la red de colectores interceptores de aguas residuales con&#13;
sus instalaciones complementarias. El decimo cometido implica el desarrollo del&#13;
proyecto basico de los colectores concentradores y la red secundaria de cada&#13;
cuenca, asi como el disefio de los colectores interceptores de aguas residuales, que&#13;
por su extremada longitud deberan proyectarse en forma discontinua, con bombeos&#13;
intermedios para mantener la rasante del colector lo mas pr6xima al terreno y&#13;
evitar el encarecimiento de su construcci6n. La elaboraci6n de este proyecto&#13;
basico no tendra un caracter detallado, sino que recogera los esquemas generales&#13;
que deberan tenerse en cuenta en el desarrollo de los proyectos constructivos de&#13;
cada colector. Por ello, este plan basico se realizara en base a la cartografia&#13;
obtenida a escala 1:2.000, y en 6l se determinaran, para los puntos principales de la&#13;
red, los caudales de disefio de los colectores, las secciones y materiales&#13;
recomendados y los perfiles longitudinales previstos para la red de colectores&#13;
concentradores, estimandose por otro lado las secciones de la red secundaria.&#13;
En relaci6n a la captaci6n de aguas pluviales, debera tenerse muy presente la&#13;
orografia de la zona, para situar los imbornales donde realmente sean necesarios a&#13;
fin de evitar inundaciones de determinadas zonas, mientras que si se dispone de&#13;
pendiente suficiente podra proponerse un sistema mixto de desague por superficie&#13;
y por colector anegado, para minimizar las inversiones a realizar. Deberan&#13;
proponerse unos disefios de instalaciones complementarias tipo, para&#13;
homogeneizar el desarrollo de la red, como pueden ser fosas areneras, aliviaderos&#13;
de aguas pluviales, pozos de resalto, pozos de intercepci6n de aguas negras,&#13;
estaciones de bombeo, etc.&#13;
El proyecto basico se valorara a precios de mercado, lo mas desglosado posible y&#13;
separadamente para cada cuenca, con el fin de poder programar las inversiones a&#13;
realizar en las distintas fases en que deba desarrollarse el Plan Director. Por lo que&#13;
a la red de colectores se refiere, se dimensionaran a la situaci6n futura, para&#13;
rentabilizar al maximo las inversiones realizadas.&#13;
5.11 Estudiar las cargas contaminantes, en la situaci6n actual, enfunci6n de&#13;
los andlisis que se efectuen en los distintos puntos de vertido. Las siguientes&#13;
tareas a desarrollar determinaran el sistema de tratamiento y evacuaci6n de las&#13;
aguas residuales. En primer lugar, se caracterizaran tanto cualitativa como&#13;
cuantitativamente los vertidos y cargas contaminantes de las diferentes cuencas,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117-&#13;
tanto los ya controlados como los restantes, que deberan incorporarse a la red&#13;
paulatinamente.&#13;
5.12 Establecer las condiciones de vertidos especiales (industriales y/o de&#13;
servicios). Puede que existan puntos de vertido que, por su origen, principalmente&#13;
en zonas industriales, viertan efluentes con cargas contaminantes tan elevadas o tan&#13;
t6xicas, peligrosas o nocivas que impidan su tratamiento conjunto con las aguas&#13;
residuales de origen domestico. En esta eventualidad, se plantearan diversas&#13;
soluciones, ya sea obligar a cada industria que pre-trate sus efluentes hasta un nivel&#13;
de calidad aceptable para el posterior tratamiento conjunto con el resto de aguas&#13;
residuales, ya sea mediante un pretratamiento conjunto de las aguas residuales&#13;
industriales, etc. En cualquier caso, el Plan Director debera establecer una&#13;
normativa de uso de la red de alcantarillado, indicando, para cada caso, los limnites&#13;
maximos de contaminaci6n de cada parametro aceptables para incorporar un&#13;
vertido determinado en la red de alcantarillado.&#13;
5.13 Proponer la ubicaci6n de las Estaciones de Tratamiento. Como&#13;
complemento al plan de ejecuci6n de la red de colectores, se propondra el numero&#13;
y ubicaci6n de las depuradoras. Junto con la decisi6n adoptada, deberan aportarse&#13;
los datos que hagan posible realizar, dentro del plan de ordenaci6n del area&#13;
metropolitana, las reservas de suelo suficientes para albergar las estaciones de&#13;
tratamiento a construir en el futuro.&#13;
5.14  Estudiar el desague de los efluentes depurados enfunci6n del medio&#13;
receptor. Una vez planteada la situaci6n de las estaciones depuradoras, debera&#13;
definirse en cada caso, de acuerdo con las normativas internacionales de defensa de&#13;
cauces, aguas continentales superficiales y subterraneas y aguas marinas, el grado&#13;
de depuraci6n a que deberan someterse las aguas residuales en las plantas&#13;
depuradoras, segin sean el medio receptor, en funci6n del punto de vertido y del&#13;
grado de diluci6n de las aguas depuradas en las del medio receptor. Se requerira&#13;
un menor grado de tratamiento en las depuradoras costeras que en las interiores&#13;
que verteran el efluente al rio, ya que en este caso el objetivo prioritario es el de la&#13;
recuperaci6n total del rio para alcanzar las condiciones naturales de calidad de las&#13;
aguas.&#13;
5.15 Proponer un plan de acondicionamiento y evacuaci6n de losfangos&#13;
obtenidos en lasplantas depuradoras. Debera proponerse un plan de gesti6n o&#13;
eliminaci6n de los residuos obtenidos en las plantas depuradoras, teniendo en&#13;
cuenta las fases de construcci6n de las plantas, el grado de estabilizaci6n y&#13;
mineralizaci6n de los fangos y su posible aplicaci6n al suelo agricola u otros usos&#13;
antes de mandarlos directamente a vertedero, si su recuperaci6n puede ser&#13;
rentable.&#13;
5.16 Disenar los procesosy elementos basicos de las Estaciones de&#13;
Tratamiento (E. T.). La elaboraci6n de estos proyectos basicos no supondra un&#13;
mayor nivel de detalle dentro del plan Director, sino que recogera los esquemas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118-&#13;
generales que deberan tenerse en cuenta en el desarrollo de los proyectos&#13;
constructivos de cada E. T. Como paso previo al disefno de cada una de ellas:&#13;
(a)    Se caracterizaran las aguas residuales generadas en las diferentes zonas del&#13;
area metropolitana, que llegaran a cada estaci6n de tratamiento, en funci6n&#13;
de los resultados aportados en los apartados 5.11 y 5.12.&#13;
(b)   Se estableceran los parametros de disefio basicos de cada depuradora, tanto&#13;
para la situaci6n actual como futura, y los resultados a obtener en cada una&#13;
de las fases de construcci6n propuestas, teniendo siempre en cuenta el&#13;
medio receptor y su capacidad de diluci6n, seguin el epigrafe 5.14.&#13;
(c)    Se considerara en principio la opci6n de vertido de las aguas residuales&#13;
(despues de un tratamiento primario) directamente al mar a traves de un&#13;
emisario submarino; para ello, deberan conocerse la batimetria del litoral y&#13;
el sentido de las corrientes marinas pr6ximas a la costa para elegir el punto&#13;
de vertido mas id6neo.&#13;
(d)   Se establecera el plan de ejecuci6n de cada una de las depuradoras en&#13;
funci6n del coste de las inversiones de cada soluci6n alternativa.&#13;
(e)   Las depuradoras actuaran como unidades de gesti6n del sistema de&#13;
Saneamiento y drenaje de Santo Domingo y el Distrito Nacional. Cada&#13;
depuradora debera asumir la responsabilidad de gesti6n de los colectores y&#13;
residuos (lodos) correspondientes a su sistema de Saneamiento y debera&#13;
preverse un plan de control descentralizado para cada depuradora, del&#13;
fuincionamiento y estado de las instalaciones a lo largo de la red, como&#13;
areneros, compuertas de alivio, estaciones de bombeo, etc.&#13;
5.17  Formular el Programa de Inversiones. Una vez establecido y valorado el&#13;
Plan Director, la ultima tarea a realizar sera la formulaci6n de un programa de&#13;
inversiones en diversos periodos en el que se compagine y acompase la resoluci6n&#13;
en el tiempo de los problemas mas perentorios con los objetivos finales del plan.&#13;
Este programa de inversiones debera contemplar las fuentes de financiaci6n que&#13;
puedan hacer viable la ejecuci6n de las obras, asi como el mantenimiento y&#13;
explotaci6n de las instalaciones.&#13;

(b)   Andlisisy Prognosis. Se presentaran analisis, tanto de los datos recogidos&#13;
de informaci6n existente como de los que se hayan tomado expresamente&#13;
por ser inexistentes o por otros motivos. Se presentaran, asimismo, los&#13;
datos de sintesis aplicados al desarrollo del Estudio Infornativo. A partir&#13;
de estos datos basicos se estableceran, en lo que sea menester, las&#13;
prognosis de su evoluci6n a lo largo de los 20 afios considerados,&#13;
utilizando para dichas prognosis las metodologias oportunas en cada caso.&#13;
Los datos resultantes se presentaran agrupados con la sintesis de los datos&#13;
existentes analizados.&#13;
(c)   Elecci6n y Diseino B6sico de las Opciones Consideradas. La elecci6n y&#13;
disefio basico de las opciones a considerar se hara en funci6n de la sintesis&#13;
de datos basicos de los diversos factores que intervienen en el disenio de&#13;
cada una, asi como de los datos obtenidos con las prognosis que se hayan&#13;
establecido. En cada opci6n se consideraran las etapas necesarias de su&#13;
desarrollo a lo largo de 20 ahos considerados y se concretara el diseflo&#13;
basico y alcance de la primera etapa. Todas las opciones contemplaran la&#13;
realizaci6n de las obras necesarias, conservaci6n de la autopista y su&#13;
explotaci6n. Al menos una de las opciones que se consideren, contemplari&#13;
la incorporaci6n de la autopista y carretera existentes. En cada una de las&#13;
alternativas en que se contemple la posibilidad de explotaci6n por peaje se&#13;
diferenciaran dos opciones, detallando las variaciones (tanto en obras e&#13;
instalaciones, como en conservaci6n y explotaci6n) que correspondan a&#13;
cada una.&#13;
(d)   Definicion de las Opciones Consideradas. Se presentaran y analizaran las&#13;
opciones funcionales y tecnicas con la profundidad y extensi6n suficientes&#13;
para valorarlas de forma completa, evaluarlas, compararlas y&#13;
seleccionarlas. Todas las opciones han de ser viables en los aspectos&#13;
sociales, administrativos, econ6micos, tecnicos y medioambientales. Se&#13;
estableceran planos y esquemas que definan claramente las posiciones&#13;
relativas de las distintas opciones entre si y respecto a los puntos mas&#13;
importantes de la red actual, de los nucleos de poblaci6n o de puntos&#13;
singulares existentes.&#13;
(e)    Valoraci6n y Evaluaci6n de las Opciones Estudiadas. Se procedera, para&#13;
cada opci6n, a valorar los costes de realizaci6n de cada una de las partes de&#13;
la misma en cada una de las fases de su programaci6n. Estos costes&#13;
incluiran los de proyecto y ejecuci6n, la adquisici6n de terrenos necesarios,&#13;
las modificaciones de servicios existentes, las obras o indemnizaciones&#13;
necesarias para atender a las servidumbres actuales, las complementarias de&#13;
correcci6n o compensaci6n del impacto ambiental, etc. Se determinaran,&#13;
asimnismo, para cada opci6n, los costes de mantenimiento y conservaci6n&#13;
ordinaria y de conservaci6n peri6dica a lo largo de todo el periodo&#13;
considerado o, en las opciones para explotaci6n con peaje, si los plazos que&#13;
se precisen para la concesi6n fueran mayores de 20 afios, a lo largo de todo&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
el periodo de concesi6n. Estos costes incluiran los que se prevean para&#13;
cobro del peaje y, en su caso, para el funcionamiento de las instalaciones y&#13;
servicios que se prevea establecer. Tambien se procedera a deterninar&#13;
para cada una de las opciones y a lo largo del horizonte de 20 ainos o del&#13;
periodo considerado, los costes del usuario del conjunto del trafico del&#13;
corredor que se prevea ha de utilizar la Autopista en relaci6n con los costes&#13;
a que da lugar la circulaci6n por el resto de la red viaria del corredor. Para&#13;
los costes y beneficios que puedan valorarse monetariamente se&#13;
estableceran, para cada opci6n, los correspondientes indicadores de&#13;
rentabilidad, concretando justificadamente, la tasa de actualizaci6n y el&#13;
periodo considerado para el analisis. Para lo que no resulte posible&#13;
cuantificar monetariamente, se podran de manifiesto los demas costes&#13;
sociales a que dara lugar el establecimiento y funcionamiento de la&#13;
Autopista, como pueden ser los accidentes de circulaci6n, las limitaciones&#13;
de accesibilidad, las demoras producidas por la congesti6n, la&#13;
contaminaci6n ambiental, las lesiones al medio ambiente y al paisaje, etc.&#13;
La incidencia de todos estos items en la evaluaci6n se llevara a cabo por la&#13;
comparaci6n de las cuantias de cada uno de estos dafios que se producen&#13;
en las distintas opciones que se evaluian y en las que se producen en el resto&#13;
de la red viaria del corredor.&#13;
(f)    Comparaci6ny Selecci6n de Soluciones. Se seleccionara la opci6n&#13;
estudiada que se estime mas conveniente, habida cuenta de su evaluaci6n&#13;
en los aspectos sociales, administrativos, econ6micos, tecnicos y&#13;
medioambientales, sin omitir los que se refieren a la conservaci6n,&#13;
explotaci6n y cobro de peaje. La opci6n elegida sera objeto de una&#13;
descripci6n detallada en todo lo que se refiere a su funcionalidad,&#13;
localizaci6n, caracteristicas, nivel de servicio, impacto ambiental,&#13;
instalaciones complementarias y cobro de peaje, etc. La descripci6n&#13;
permitira asimismo, el establecimiento de una valoraci6n aproximada de las&#13;
adquisiciones, obras, instalaciones y otros trabajos necesarios en cada una&#13;
de las etapas de ejecuci6n que se contemplen.&#13;
(g)   Presupuestos Indicativos de la Opci6n Seleccionada. Se formularan&#13;
presupuestos indicativos de la opci6n o de las opciones alternativas (sin y&#13;
con peaje) seleccionadas que comprenderan para cada etapa:&#13;
(i)   Presupuesto de obras e instalaciones.&#13;
(ii)   Presupuestos de adquisici6n de terrenos, modificaciones de&#13;
servicios, indemnizaci6n de servidumbres, y correcci6n del impacto&#13;
ambiental.&#13;
(iii)  Presupuestos de conservaci6n ordinaria y conservaci6n peri6dica.&#13;
(iv)   Presupuestos de gastos de explotaci6n y cobro del peaje.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
(v)   Presupuestos de gastos de Direcci6n y Administraci6n.&#13;
(h)   Estudio de Tarifas y Plazos de Concesi6n para la Financiaci6n Total&#13;
Mediante Peaje. Para la opci6n seleccionada con cobro de peaje se&#13;
establecera un estudio de la financiaci6n, que tenga en cuenta las&#13;
aportaciones de la Administraci6n y/o de terceros que se prevean (en&#13;
dinero, especies, avales, beneficios fiscales, etc.) y los ingresos por peaje y&#13;
por prestaciones de servicios a los usuarios. El Estudio comprendera el&#13;
cilculo de las tarifas de peaje que serian necesarias para la financiaci6n&#13;
mediante peaje de los costes de ejecuci6n no asumidos por la&#13;
Administraci6n o por terceros, costes financieros de la financiaci6n&#13;
mediante prestamos, costes de conservaci6n y costes de explotaci6n&#13;
(incluida Direcci6n y Administraci6n de la Concesionaria) y Capital y&#13;
beneficios del Capital si la Concesionaria fuese una Sociedad Privada.&#13;
Para este calculo se partiri de la prognosis de trafico incluida en los datos basicos&#13;
y de los presupuestos del apartado anterior y de un coste del dinero y esquema tarifario&#13;
que se propondrin razonadamente. Con base en ello, se calcularan los niveles tarifarios&#13;
que permitan, sin beneficio alguno para la concesionaria, el pago de todos los gastos&#13;
babidos (incluso financieros) y la amortizaci6n total de la inversi6n en plazos de 20 y de&#13;
30 afios.&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL HIGHWAYS PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECrS&#13;
A.   Key Environmental Issues&#13;
1.    Most physical improvements under the project consist of the rehabilitation or&#13;
reconstruction of existing facilities and, therefore, direct environmental impacts on natural systems&#13;
and right-of-ways will be of less importance. However, there is evidence of increasing erosion,&#13;
slope stability and drainage impacts along existing roads caused by original improper design and&#13;
construction and the absence of environmentally sound maintenance practices. The project also&#13;
includes the construction of four short (20.3 km in total) by-passes around mid-sized towns.&#13;
2.    At present, SEOPC's capability to address environmental issues associated with roads and&#13;
other transport projects is very weak. The Department for the Control of Earth Excavation&#13;
(DCCT) in SEOPC was created in 1971 in order to prevent indiscriminate excavation and&#13;
destruction of the environment in borrow pits and construction material mines. Although the&#13;
institutional strengthening of DCCT has been included as a component of previous road sector&#13;
projects financed by the Bank, the DCCT has not yet developed the capabilities and technical&#13;
experience to address those and other environmental concerns in the sector. At present, the&#13;
DCCT is understaffed and without a clear role in the day to day functions within the SEOPC.&#13;
3.    There are then three principal categories of environmental concerns related to this project,&#13;
which include: (i) the environrental management of road rehabilitation and by-pass construction&#13;
works proposed under the project; (ii) the need to strengthen SEOPC's institutional capability to&#13;
manage environmental issues related to road and transport projects; and (iii) the need for adopting&#13;
an environmental manual or environmental guidelines for road construction, rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
B.    Environmental Screening of Project Works&#13;
4.    An Environmental Assessment study on the works included in the proposed project was&#13;
carried out by a group of national and international consultants, financed under the ongoing loan&#13;
3350-DO. The final EA report was delivered before appraisal.&#13;
5.    Most of the area of influence of the roads concerned has been intervened for decades.&#13;
Principal land use activities include agriculture (sugar cane, rice, tobacco, and coffee) and cattle&#13;
ranching. Only one of the proposed works (one by-pass) will cross a small mangrove forest&#13;
patch. The principal characteristics of screened rehabilitation and by-passes works as well as&#13;
some physical baseline information are presented in Attachment 1 to this Annex.&#13;
6.    The proposed works will have little to moderate environmental impacts. Most&#13;
environmental concerns are associated with (i) the appropriate management of construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
wastes and construction activities (most road rehabilitation and reconstruction sub-projects); (ii)&#13;
the crossing of drainage and streams that eventually feed to mangrove and wetlands, and other&#13;
sensitive areas such as irrigation canals (one rehabilitation sub-project and one by-pass); and (iii)&#13;
right of way expansion in densely populated areas (one rehabilitation sub-project and one by-&#13;
pass). All these impacts have been identified and appropriate mitigation measures have been&#13;
proposed and incorporated in project design. For instance, clearing of mangrove trees for the&#13;
crossing of the Higuamo River was avoided with an innovative bridge design that would span&#13;
over the riverine trees. All mitigation measures in turn will be included in all bidding documents&#13;
and construction contracts as well as supervision activities. A summary matrix of environmental&#13;
impacts and mitigation measures for each sub-project are presented in Attachments 2 and 3 to this&#13;
Annex.&#13;
7.    All proposed works, particularly the proposed new by-passes, were screened for their&#13;
potential resettlement of population. Different alignments were considered and systematically&#13;
compared according to their technical, ecological and social merits. One of the proposed&#13;
alignments for the Bani by-pass, for instance, would have displaced over 200 poor urban families&#13;
in that city. Alternative routes are not technically available since the population opposes new road&#13;
construction between the city and the ocean front. In this manner, the selected alternative would&#13;
upgrade the existing accesses and build a second bridge to replace the existing one at the entrance&#13;
of the town. All other by-passes will not have any significant need for resettlement.&#13;
C.   Environmental Institutional Strengthening of SEOPC&#13;
8.    Although the Dominican Republic's environmental regulatory and institutional framework&#13;
is at present weak, it is clear that the SEOPC has an overall responsibility to address&#13;
environmental issues for public works and communications. The most expedite mechanism to&#13;
promote an adequate environmental management of sectorial projects would be to expand the&#13;
functions and staff within the DCCT into an Environmental Unit to manage environmental aspects&#13;
of road and transport projects in addition to the existing functions for the control of excavation of&#13;
construction materials.&#13;
9.    The functions of the Environmental Unit would include: (i) advising the SEOPC on&#13;
environmental concerns in the transport sector; (ii) incorporating environmental objectives into&#13;
feasibility and design studies; (iii) establishing environmental policies and procedures for road and&#13;
other transport projects; (iv) ensuring compliance with the Environmental Manual for Road&#13;
Design and Construction discussed below; (v) ensuring that all bidding documents and contracts&#13;
contain the appropriate environmental conditions; and (vi) monitoring environmental factors and&#13;
maintaining a database.&#13;
10.   An Action Plan for strengthening DCCT was agreed during appraisal, which includes: (i)&#13;
technical assistance to implement the proposed functions and procedures; (ii) special studies such&#13;
as an ecological sensitivity map of DR for road infrastructure; (iii) purchase of equipment,&#13;
including vehicles, computers, and geographical information systems; and (iv) training program&#13;
for the DCCT and other relevant departments within the DCCT. This Action Plan will&#13;
complement similar resources available under the IDB Rural Roads project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
D.   Environmental Manual for Road Design and Construction&#13;
11.   An Environmental Manual for Road Design and Construction has been prepared and will&#13;
be adopted by SEOPC. The purpose of this manual is to establish specific rules for minimizng&#13;
environmental damage during the construction and rehabilitation of roads. The manual defines&#13;
specific penalties for each type of environmental violation by individual employees as well as by&#13;
contracting companies. Examples of the topics that are included in the manual are: (i) applicable&#13;
environmental and natural resource legislation that contractors have to comply with during&#13;
construction and maintenance activities; (ii) explicit prohibitions and environmental behavior&#13;
guidelines for work crews, specially along sensitive areas; (iii) proper selection and management&#13;
of quarries, borrow pits, gravel extraction along rivers, and other sources of construction&#13;
materials; (iv) eventual rehabilitation of affected areas through soil replacement and revegetation;&#13;
(v) selection of camp sites, management of camp wastes and guidelines for camp dismantling and&#13;
abandonment; (vi) proper disposal of excavated earth and spoil material to avoid contaminating&#13;
streams or other unnecessary environmental damage; and (vii) proper disposal of wastes from&#13;
construction machinery and equipment.&#13;
12.   The EA report mentioned in para. 4 above also included the preparation of a Manual of&#13;
Functions and Procedures for the Environmental Unit. These functions and procedures of the&#13;
Environmental Unit as well as the Manual for Road Design and Construction will be officially&#13;
adopted by SEOPC before project effectiveness.&#13;

ANNEX S&#13;
DOMOICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    Economic costs and benefits were quantified for the highway widening program,&#13;
the bridge and bypass construction program, the highway reconstruction program and the&#13;
highway resurfacing program. Economic tests were used early in the project preparation&#13;
stage to screen investments and select projects, and the SEOPC prepared formal feasibility&#13;
studies using methods and parameters agreed with the Bank. The investment evaluated&#13;
account for 80 percent of the base cost of the project. No costs or benefits have been&#13;
quantified for routine maintenance, road signalization, supervision, equipment acquisition,&#13;
institutional development, training and technical assistance activities representing 20&#13;
percent of the total base cost.&#13;
A..   Highway Road Widening Program&#13;
2.    The three highways under consideration -- Santo Domingo - San Isidro, Bajos de&#13;
Haina - Refineria, and Santiago - Navarrete,-already present average daily traffics of&#13;
16,500 to 9,000 vehicles. The highways are already congested and would become more&#13;
so if no actions are undertaken, severely increasing vehicle operating costs and time-&#13;
related costs. Table A8. 1 describes each project characteristics and costs.&#13;

3.    The traffic composition is around 77 percent for cars and pickups, 2 percent for&#13;
buses and 21 percent for trucks, and the normal traffic is assumed to grow at an annual&#13;
rate of around 3 percent varying slightly by vehicle class. For the widening alternative, it&#13;
has been assumed an additional generated traffic of 10 percent of the normal traffic. The&#13;
value of time for those traveling on private cars is assumed to be 9.0 Dominican pesos per&#13;
hour, representing 50 percent of the prorated value of a mix of passengers consisting of 70&#13;
percent, low income (6.7 RD$ per hour, the minimum wage), 20 percent, middle income&#13;
(33.3 RD$ per hour), and 10 percent, high income (66.6 RD$ per hour). For those&#13;
traveling on buses, the value of time is assumed to be 2.0 Dominican pesos per hour,&#13;
representing a conservative assumption of 30 percent of the minimum wage considering&#13;
that only work-related trips are considered in the analysis.&#13;
4.    Each project includes the widening followed by a maintenance strategy of routine&#13;
maintenance, 100 percent patching, and resealings when the damaged area reaches 50%.&#13;
The economic analysis compares the project with a base altemative that contains the same&#13;
maintenance strategy adopted for the project case. Therefore, the economic analysis is&#13;
measuring only the benefits due to the congestion reduction and due to the slower road&#13;
deterioration of the widened roads caused by the spread of the trucks loading damage over&#13;
a wider pavement surface. The widenings will more than double the road capacity and&#13;
reduce the roadside friction caused by pedestrians, vendors, animals, etc. Thus, higher&#13;
travel speeds are the mayor source of benefits. The costs of the maintenance operations&#13;
were assumed to be the same as those considered for the reconstruction program&#13;
(paragraph 13 of this Annex). The cost per kilometer of widening the three road varies&#13;
from US$ 640,000 for the Santo Domingo-San Isidro highway to US$ 780,000 for the&#13;
Santiago-Navarrete highway.&#13;
5.    The economic analysis of the highway-widening component was undertaken with&#13;
the application of the new version of the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards&#13;
Model (1995 HDM System) which incorporates capacity constraints into the analysis of&#13;
rehabilitation strategies. The HDM model performs a life-cycle analysis of the project and&#13;
the base alternative, computing the yearly road deterioration and the resulting road agency&#13;
and road user costs. The HDM model computes, for a given road and traffic, first the&#13;
free-flow speeds and them adjust these speeds to take into account the congestion level.&#13;
The resulting speeds are then used to compute the vehicle operating and travel time costs&#13;
that are also a function of the road roughness, the road geometry, and vehicle&#13;
characteristics. Table A8.2 below shows the user costs inputs used in the HDM analysis&#13;
and the resulting typical user costs obtained for a series of speeds and roughness levels.&#13;

decrease by 20 percent, and if the value of time is not considered in the analysis. It also&#13;
shows the traffic and project costs that will yield an EIRR of 12%, which shows that the&#13;
project benefits are being affected more due to the traffic uncertainty.&#13;

B.    Bridge Construction and Bypass Program&#13;
7.    The bridge construction and bypass program comprises the construction of&#13;
three new bridges, the widening of an existing one and two bypasses of cities with the&#13;
corresponding intersections. The program is divided into the following four projects: a)&#13;
La Romana bypass that includes the construction of a 152.8 m bridge over the Rio Dulce&#13;
river and the 8.0 km bypass, b) Bani project that includes the construction of a 150.0 m&#13;
bridge over the Bani river, c) San Pedro de Macoris bypass that includes the construction&#13;
of a 261.0 m bridge over the Higuamo river and the 12.3 km bypass, and d) Yaque del&#13;
Norte river actual bridge widening. The three bridges to be constructed are on heavily&#13;
trafficked urban areas, with average daily traffic over 2000 vehicles per day, and two of&#13;
the bridges (Higuamo and Bani) will replace bridges currently in danger of collapse. The&#13;
fourth bridge, involves only deck widening and it is on a road with medium traffic volume&#13;
of 800 vehicles per day. Table A8.5 describes each project characteristics and costs.&#13;

8.     The benefits of this program are associated with savings in vehicle operating costs,&#13;
travel time costs, and future maintenance costs. For all projects, the economic evaluation&#13;
was done estimating the total transport costs with and without the project and the net&#13;
project benefits. The road agency costs, that includes the project costs and future&#13;
maintenance costs, were estimated based on engineering design. In each case, the HDM&#13;
model was used to estimate the unit vehicle operating and time costs per vehicle-km, that&#13;
are a function of the road geometry, road condition and travel speeds. These inputs were&#13;
measured for the current roads and estimated for the new alignments. These unit user&#13;
costs were then multiplied by the traffic data and road lengths to obtain the user costs that&#13;
are part, along with the agency costs, of the total transport costs.&#13;
9.     Two of the bridge projects, S.P. de Macoris and La Romana, include the&#13;
construction of city bypasses that would divert long distance traffic from existing&#13;
highways. Therefore, users selecting to use the new facilities will benefit in terms of&#13;
reduction on vehicle operating and travel time costs. The diversion rate is estimated to&#13;
vary between 35 and 50 percent, depending on the difference between the value of travel&#13;
costs across the existing and the proposed roads. As a consequence of the faster speeds&#13;
and reduced travel times brought about by the projects, a 25 percent increase in existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
traffic is assumed to be generated and the corresponding benefits were included in the&#13;
analysis. Due to the traffic diversion, the remaining traffic on the existing highways will be&#13;
much less congested and, therefore, the users who remain using the existing highways will&#13;
also benefit from the project. These additional project benefits were not included in the&#13;
analysis as well as the air pollution and accident reduction benefits, particularly associated&#13;
with traffic reduction in urban areas. The remaining two projects, the substitution of a&#13;
narrow and unsafe bridge structure over the Bani river and the widening of the Yaque del&#13;
Norte bridge, base their feasibility on possible reductions in vehicle operating and travel&#13;
time costs. Traffic diversion from other highways and traffic generation are not considered&#13;
in the analysis.&#13;
10.    With all these assumptions, the economic analysis yields EIRRs exceeding 12% for&#13;
all the proposed projects. Table A8.6 shows the results of the economic analysis in terms&#13;
of net present value and economical internal rate of return for each bridge/bypass and the&#13;
results of the sensitivity analysis performed for each of the sub-projects to test variations&#13;
in the EIRRs in the event that project costs increase by 20 percent, the benefits decrease&#13;
by 15 percent, and if the value of time is not included in the analysis. It also shows the&#13;
traffic and project costs that will yield an EIRR of 12%.&#13;

Highway Reconstruction and Resurfacing Programs&#13;
11.   The economic analysis of reconstructing/rehabilitating 169 km and resurfacing&#13;
627.9 km of paved roads was carried out using the HDM model that is designed to&#13;
recommend the solution which minimizes the net present value of the costs associated&#13;
with each solution including vehicle operating costs and investment and maintenance&#13;
costs. The higher the traffic level, the more rapid is the deterioration in road condition,&#13;
and the more likely is a higher-cost investment alternative.&#13;
12.   The sections to be rehabilitated or resurfaced were divided into homogeneous links&#13;
in terms of traffic levels and physical condition. For each link, traffic was projected based&#13;
on historical trends and expected population and production growth in the region. Using&#13;
engineering data and climatic conditions, as well as traffic characteristics and cost&#13;
parameters, the model simulated the operating conditions for each link and calculated total&#13;
vehicle operating costs. The following options were examined for each road: (a) carrying&#13;
out minimum maintenance at a cost of about US$ 360 per km; (b) carrying out minimum&#13;
maintenance plus all required patching, at a cost, that varies according to the thickness of&#13;
the road surface, of around US$ 9.00 per m2; (c) routine maintenance plus all patching&#13;
plus sealing every 5 years at a cost of US$ 1.02 per m2; (d) overlays every 10 years at a&#13;
cost estimated at around US$ 9.00 per m2, varying with the thickness of the road surface;&#13;
and (e) reconstruction, at a cost of US$ 16.03 per m2 when road roughness reaches a&#13;
predetermined level. The cost of rehabilitation and reconstruction was determined based&#13;
on a preliminary engineering study for each road link.&#13;
13.   Tables A8.7 and A8.8 below show the length, cost, average daily traffic (ADT),&#13;
roughness (IRI), and the results of the economic analysis in terms of net present value&#13;
(NPV) and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for each link in the highway&#13;
reconstruction and resurfacing programs respectively. They also show the results of the&#13;
sensitive analysis performed for each of the sub-projects to test variations in the EIRRs in&#13;
the event that costs increase by 10 and 20 percent, or the benefits decrease by 10 and 20&#13;
percent.&#13;

Risk Analysis&#13;
14.    An analysis performed to test the effects (risks) of postponing the widening and&#13;
reconstruction investments shows that for all projects the net benefits are reduced if&#13;
investments are postponed. Specifically, were investments postponed by one or two&#13;
years, the Net Present Value for each project would decrease on average by 6 percent and&#13;
12 percent, respectively, though NPVs would remain greater than zero. This analysis&#13;
shows that, from an economic perspective, the proposed sub-projects should be&#13;
undertaken in earnest. Minor delays, however, would not affect the economic worthiness&#13;
of the sub-projects.&#13;
15.    An analysis performed to test the effects (risks) of not implementing an optimal&#13;
maintenance policy after completion of the various rehabilitation and widening works,&#13;
shows that benefits will decrease slightly if a proper maintenance program (including&#13;
routine maintenance, patching and resealing) were not timely implemented. If only a&#13;
limited routine maintenance is applied, the analysis shows that the NPV of sub-projects&#13;
would decrease on average by 9 percent, though the economic rate of return remains&#13;
greater than 12 percent for all sub-projects. The results reflect economic benefits for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
proposed sub-projects that are sustained even in light of sub-optimal maintenance policies.&#13;
This is always the case for roads in good condition (as the ones being rehabilitated under&#13;
the project) because vehicle operating costs vary in relation to road roughness progression&#13;
and road roughness increases rapidly only once the road has deteriorated below a fair&#13;
condition. Therefore, a sub-optimal maintenance policy affects economic benefits only&#13;
marginally for roads in good condition.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
16.   All sub-projects yield a rate of return of 12% and above including the events&#13;
considered in the sensitivity analysis that increases the project costs or reduces the user&#13;
benefits, except in the case of the reconstruction of the roads Boya - Sabana Grande, Don&#13;
Juan-Dofia Maria, and Esperanza Mao, for which the EIRR falls to about 1 1.5%. We find this&#13;
figure acceptable and, therefore, the sub-projects have been retained in the respective&#13;
programs. The EIRR of the Bajos de Haina - Refineria widening and the Bani bridge are 8.6%&#13;
and 8.0% in the case that the value of time is not included in the analysis, indicating that for&#13;
these projects most of the benefits are derived from time savings. Due to the conservative&#13;
value of time being adopted in the analysis and due to the fact that the purpose of these&#13;
projects is to reduce congestion, we find the feasibility of these projects acceptable. Table&#13;
A8.9 below summarizes the results of the economic analyses by project components. The&#13;
weighted average rate of return for the evaluated investments is 24.5%.&#13;

17.   The above analyses partly underestimate the true economic benefits of the highway&#13;
programs because they do not fully quantify the additional benefits to be derived from&#13;
increased tourism activity or the environmental benefits from smoother vehicle operation&#13;
and the avoidance of congested traffic conditions with frequent stop-and-go situations.&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
HIGHWAY NATIONAL PROJECT&#13;
ORGANZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT COORDINATION TEAM&#13;
1.    The SEOPC will have overall responsibility for project coordination and&#13;
implementation. Actual implementation will be assigned to the General Coordinator,&#13;
assisted by a Project Coordination Team (PCT) and the cooperation of DARE, the four&#13;
Road Directorates (DGC, DGM, DGSFO and DGPP), DRS and DCCT as has been the&#13;
practice in the ongoing Bank-financed project (FMRP) The organizational structure of the&#13;
PCT is shown in the attached Chart. The PCT will enjoy ample technical, administrative&#13;
and financial autonomy. The project will finance five consultants to fill the external&#13;
positions in the PCT: the head and four professionals; and a secretary (bilingual and&#13;
computer literate). The rest of the engaged staff will be paid from local counterpart funds.&#13;
2.    Scope and Functions of the Team. The scope and functions of the PCT will be&#13;
composed of but not limited to the following:&#13;
(a)   carrying out the day-to-day administrative management of the project,&#13;
including drafting, for the General Coordinator or Secretary's of State&#13;
signature, all communications on the project between the SEOPC and&#13;
contractors, suppliers and consultants, and the Bank;&#13;
(b)   reviewing engineering studies and maintenance;&#13;
(c)   conducting all complementary economic evaluation of proposed sub-&#13;
projects, new or with additional cost of more than 25% of the project cost&#13;
estimate;&#13;
(d)   supervising contractor's and consultant's work, including progress review&#13;
and monitoring;&#13;
(e)   assisting with the procurement of civil works, office equipment and&#13;

PROJECT PERFORMANCE MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
The following set of Project Performance Indicators have been prepared by the&#13;
SEOPC with the help of the Bank to serve as the basis for both the project supervision and&#13;
evaluation. They have been organized in four groups: input, output, outcome and impact&#13;
indicators to link the project objectives and components (inputs) with the expected&#13;
processes, outputs and outcomes. They will provide the project implementers with a&#13;
monitoring tool for ensuring proper use of project resources and that the goods and&#13;
services the project is expected to produce are delivered.&#13;
A.    Input Indicators measure the quantity of resources provided for the project&#13;
activities.&#13;

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
STAFF INPUT FOR PROJECT LAUNCH AND ANNUAL AND MID-COURSE REVIEWS&#13;
1.    The nature and scope of the project, the large programs of civil works and institutional&#13;
strengthening, the use of new pavement technologies and the introduction to maintenance by&#13;
contract and technical auditing will necessitate extensive and close supervision, especially&#13;
during the first two years of project implementation.&#13;
2.    A project launch mission and yearly project reviews will be organized, assisting the&#13;
staff of the implementing agencies to develop a common understanding of the project's overall&#13;
development objectives, operational procedures, coordination needs and potential&#13;
implementation problems and to select the components to be implemented during the&#13;
subsequent year. A qualified local expert will be engaged, for about two or three days a&#13;
month, to follow up project implementation for the Bank.&#13;
3.    The tentative composition and staffing level of the supervision plan and the supervision&#13;
timetable are presented in Table A13. 1. All missions will involve discussions with the project&#13;
officials in the SEOPC at its headquarters as well as field visits, on the basis of which the&#13;
mission will evaluate the project. Following is a description of the purpose and objectives of&#13;
each mission:&#13;
4.    Project Launch Workshop. A project launch workshop will be conducted in the&#13;
second quarter of 1997 to:&#13;
(a)   review and fine tune, as necessary, the implementation plan of the executing&#13;
agency (SEOPC);&#13;
(b)   identify and plan the required coordination among the road directorates, and;&#13;
(c)   review project management, procurement, environmental assessment,&#13;
disbursement, accounting and auditing procedures and requirements and&#13;
technical assistance and training programs.&#13;
5.    Annual Project Implementation Reviews. The purpose of the annual review is to:&#13;
(a)   assess the project performance against specific objectives and targets;&#13;
(b)   identify implementation problems and issues, and;&#13;
(c)   plan for the upcoming year, including the selection of subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 170 -&#13;
6.    Mid-Term Implementation Review. This review will be carried out in December&#13;
1999 jointly by the Government and the Bank. The focus of the review is to ascertain to what&#13;
extent the project has achieved its development objectives. The Project Coordinator will&#13;
prepare the same reports for the Project Mid-Term Review as for the Annual Project Reviews.&#13;
However, if special issues warrant more detailed analysis additional studies will be carried&#13;
out.&#13;
The mid-term review will cover the annual review coverage plus:&#13;
(a)   project performance;&#13;
(b)   identification of areas in need of adjustment;&#13;
(c)   status of execution of the institutional strengthening program;&#13;
(d)   implementation of the highway maintenance plan;&#13;
(e)   implementation of the Road Fund and the Road Agency (ONMV);&#13;
(f)   impact of technical assistance;&#13;
(g)   effectiveness of environmental assessment; and&#13;
(h)   availability of counterpart funds.&#13;
7.    Modifications to Project Design. During the annual and mid-term reviews, there is&#13;
an opportunity to update project targets and discuss changes needed in the project design or&#13;
implementation plans. In this context, the Bank may require that the SEOPC prepare an&#13;
action plan for the Bank's review and approval within two months following the completion of&#13;
the corresponding project review. The SEOPC will incorporate the changes agreed upon in&#13;
the project documents. The PCT Coordinator will be responsible for organizing the mid-term&#13;
project review and ensuring that agreed follow-up actions, satisfactory to the Banks, are taken&#13;
in a timely manner.&#13;
8.   Implementation Plans. The project launch in FY97 will require 6 staff weeks.&#13;
Annual reviews would require about 6 staff weeks per year. In addition, one regular&#13;
supervision mission (one of one-week duration), comprising the task manager, a transport&#13;
specialist and an institutional development specialist will be necessary. The mid-term review&#13;
will require 9 staff weeks. Thus, total field supervision will amount to 55 staff weeks, and&#13;
office supervision is expected to amount to an additional 25 weeks, for a total of 80 staff&#13;
weeks during the life of the project, i.e. an average of about 16 staff weeks per year.&#13;
9.    During the first two years of project implementation, supervision efforts will focus on&#13;
organization and team development with a view toward strengthening the SEOPC's operational&#13;
capacity. The project launch workshop will be followed by additional supervision input to&#13;
familiarize selected local staff with the Bank's procurement, disbursement and auditing&#13;
procedures and guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 171 -&#13;
10.   Proposed Agenda for Annual and Mid-Term Implementation Reviews. The first&#13;
annual project review will take place in February 1998. Annual reviews will focus on&#13;
evaluation of progress against the implementation of the Transport Sector Policy and Strategy&#13;
Statement and Action Plan and against agreed objective-oriented implementation, project&#13;
performance indicators and technical audits, and will serve to update and revise the 1997-2000&#13;
Highway Program and to discuss issues of project management. The result of the annual&#13;
review will be the agreement on the following year's program, and on remedial actions&#13;
required to address problems or changing circumstances during implementation.&#13;
11.   The mid-term review to be conducted not later than December 31, 1999 will follow&#13;
the same format as the annual reviews but the analysis of project impact will be expanded. In&#13;
addition to covering all the areas included in the annual reviews, the mid-term review will pay&#13;
particular attention to reviewing compliance with the Transport Sector Policy and Strategy&#13;
Statement and Action Plan, including: (a) Government's performance on project counterpart&#13;
funding and on adequately funding road maintenance; (b) the environmental guidelines for&#13;
SEOPC's activities; (c) achievement of stated performance goals; (d) effectiveness of technical&#13;
assistance carried out under the project; and (e) experience with the environmental assessment&#13;
of subprojects.&#13;
12.   A summary of the areas to be addressed in the annual and mid-term reviews is&#13;
presented below.&#13;
13.   Sector Wide Lssues. Coordination of Sector Planning and Policies: Progress in the&#13;
establishment of a functioning institutional framework for the coordination of sector&#13;
investments and policy formulation;&#13;
14. Road Subsector Issues.&#13;
(a)   concentration of road subsector investments on rehabilitation and priority&#13;
completion of projects;&#13;
(b)   availability and timeliness of project counterpart funds and road maintenance&#13;
funds;&#13;
(c)   progress in continuing reduction of SEOPC staff;&#13;
(d)   effectiveness of technical assistance;&#13;
(e)   effectiveness and experience with the environmental assessment of subprojects;&#13;
(f)   technical ability, soundness of judgment and compliance with Bank guidelines in&#13;
procurement and disbursements; and&#13;
(g)   private contractors' participation in road maintenance activities.&#13;

ANNEX 14&#13;
REPUBLICA DOMINICANA&#13;
PROYECTO DE CARRETERAS NACIONALES&#13;
TtRMINOS DE REFERENCLI PARA LA AUDITORiA FINANCIERO ADMINISTRATIVA Y DE&#13;
CUMPLIMIENTO LEGAL&#13;
1.    Selecci6n de la Firma. La firma sera seleccionada de acuerdo con el sistema de&#13;
"lista breve" con un minimo de tres y un maximo de ocho firmas profesionales de auditoria&#13;
de probada integridad, experiencia y reputaci6n. Esta selecci6n se efectuaria, para la&#13;
auditoria contractual prevista por el proyecto, a partir del 31 de Diciembre del 1997.&#13;
2.    Normas de Trabajo. El trabajo se efectuara de acuerdo con la normas&#13;
recomendadas por el "Comite de Auditoria" de la Federaci6n Intemacional de Contadores,&#13;
las recomendadas por el Instituto de Contadores P(iblicos Autorizados de la Repuiblica&#13;
Dominicana y las pautadas por el Banco Mundial en su documentaci6n FARAH y FM-600&#13;
(Pautas Minimas Sugeridas para la Auditoria de Prestatarios, Entidades Ejecutoras o&#13;
Intermediarias y Operaciones Financiadas por el Banco Mundial). En el alcance del&#13;
trabajo que se muestra mas adelante se presenta un resumen de los principales&#13;
componentes de la auditoria e informaci6n financiera requeridos por el Banco Mundial.&#13;
3.    Periodicidad de los Informes. Se requerira un informe anual de auditoria&#13;
financiero-administrativa y de cumplimiento sobre las oficinas ejecutoras y los proyectos&#13;
financiados por el Banco Mundial. El Banco podra requerir que dicho informe se emita&#13;
por periodos mas breves (por ejemplo, semestrales), en cuyo caso el ultimo informe, al 31&#13;
de Diciembre de cada ejercicio econ6mico, debera incluir el resumen de la ejecuci6n&#13;
financiero-operativa del proyecto durante todo el anio.&#13;
4.    Simultaneidad de Informes. Se recomienda que la firma de auditores a cargo del&#13;
examen se mantenga en contacto y, si fuese necesario, planifique su trabajo con la firma de&#13;
ingenieros auditores que haya sido aprobada para la realizaci6n de la ejecuci6n anual de&#13;
caracter fisico-operativo y de cumplimiento legal tecnico que hubiese sido aprobada. La&#13;
firma de auditoria financiera debera a su vez establecer contacto y efectuar su trabajo en&#13;
concordancia con la firma de auditores-ingenieros, sobre todo en aquellos sectores del&#13;
trabajo en que por su naturaleza resulte conveniente que se realicen de manera conjunta,&#13;
aun cuando cada firma se responsabilice por el trabajo efectuado por ella misma.&#13;
5.    Elaboracion del Contrato de Servicios Profesionales. Antes del comienzo de la&#13;
auditoria se elaborara un "convenio de servicios profesionales" entre la SEOPC y la firma&#13;
auditora. Este convenio se preparara de acuerdo con las practicas comunes para este tipo&#13;
de servicios y debera incluir la provisi6n de que: (i) el Banco Mundial podra tener acceso&#13;
directo a la firma auditora incluyendo los papeles de trabajo de la auditoria practicada; (ii)&#13;
los diversos informes de auditoria requeridos por el Banco Mundial seran entregados a la&#13;
SEOPC en una fecha que permita a esta la rernisi6n de tales informes al Banco Mundial&#13;
para la fecha limite prevista en los respectivos convenios de prestamo (y que en caso de&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 174 -&#13;
que el auditor documentase la imposibilidad de cumplir con este requisito, 6l remitiria una&#13;
carta a la SEOPC con copia para el Banco Mundial, indicando las razones que impedirian&#13;
dicho cumplimiento y la solicitud del prestatario al Banco Mundial solicitando al Banco&#13;
autorizaci6n para la nueva fecha de entrega).&#13;
6.    El contrato de servicios no debera incluir clausula punitiva alguna por demora en la&#13;
entrega del informe si previamente se di6 cumplimiento al procedimiento descrito. El&#13;
convenio de servicios se referira a los terminos de referencia, los cuales constituiran parte&#13;
integrante del contrato de servicio en cuesti6n.&#13;
7.    Documentaci6n Basica para la Realizaci6n de la Auditoria. Se supone que la&#13;
firma auditora antes de comenzar el trabajo habra tomado en consideraci6n o leido: (i) las&#13;
nomnas de la FIC; (ii) las recomendaciones del Comite Intemacional de Normas&#13;
Contables; (iii) el Documento de Evaluaci6n del Proyecto (Staff Appraisal Report-SAR),&#13;
preparado por el Banco Mundial (iv) el Convenio de Prestamo del Banco Mundial&#13;
correspondiente al Proyecto sujeto a examen; (v) las Ayudas-Memoria preparadas por las&#13;
misiones de Supervisi6n del Banco Mundial sobre las anteriores funciones y la&#13;

los Certificados de Gastos-SOE, y otra documentaci6n relevante con referencia al&#13;
Proyecto; (vi) la legislaci6n y reglamentaci6n del pais referente a obras puiblicas,&#13;
incluyendo la de protecci6n del medio ambiente; y (vii) otra documentaci6n relevante a la&#13;

Prestamo del Banco Mundial); cumplimiento con los indices de gesti6n y&#13;
eficiencia; analisis de las licitaciones, contratos y contratistas; analisis de la&#13;
utilizaci6n de la Asistencia Tecnica en consultores, estudios, etc.;&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The National Highway Project has two
            broad objectives: a) to improve transport sector's
            contribution to the development of major sources of growth
            and improve access to markets; and b) to consolidate the
            gains in the institutional capacity of the Secretariat of
            State of Public Works and Communication (SEOPC) under Loan
            3350-DO to maintain the road network in a stable condition
            without continued donor support and enforce new practices
            and policies started under that loan.  The project consists
            of four components: a) civil works program - consisting of
            highway construction resurfacing and maintenance, bridge
            construction, and a road signalization program; b)
            supervision and technical auditing component; c) acquisition
            of goods including vehicles, spare parts and office
            equipment; and d) consulting services and training.
