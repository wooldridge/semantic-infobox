&#13;
JONES: Today is Friday, November 21, 1986. I am Dr. Phillip Jones of the University of Sydney, and I&#13;
have with me here at the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the World Bank DuncanS. Ballantine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Duncan Ballantine joined the Bank in 1962, the year that saw Bank fmancing begin in the field of&#13;
education. Under its various guises and titles, the Bank's Education Department was led by Duncan&#13;
Ballantine from 1964 until his retirement at the end of 1977. A strong case can be made that the&#13;
formulation of Bank policy and practice in the education sector was dominated by Duncan Ballantine,&#13;
to the extent that any single person can exert such an influence in the Bank. He is remembered by staff&#13;
as a strong leader, forceful and strong-willed on occasions, and one who guided the steady evolution&#13;
and liberalization of Bank financing criteria in education, a sector which grew substantially both in size&#13;
and scope during his time at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Mr. Ballantine, perhaps we could begin by asking you to comment briefly on your professional&#13;
work and interests prior to joining the Bank and how, in fact, you came to be on its staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Well, Mr. Jones, I began my academic life, which was my working life really, as a&#13;
historian or history professor. I had taught at MIT prior to the war. I was in the Navy and then&#13;
returned to MIT. That was getting my feet wet at least in academic life. Immediately before my entry&#13;
into the Bank I had been President of Reed College in Oregon for several years, and then of Robert&#13;
College in Instanbul, an American college in Turkey, for six years. Then I left and decided I would&#13;
look for something where I wouldn't have to deal with difficult governments. I had a brief session as a&#13;
consultant for the Rockefeller Foundation for the Universidad del Valle at Cali in Colombia.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                        -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
    Then Dean Rusk, with whom I had had an acquaintance during my begging days as college&#13;
president, offered me a grant to retread my tires and get back more fully into academic life. I accepted&#13;
that, and went to Harvard where they readily welcomed me as a research associate since I didn't need&#13;
any money. And then I came to a conference here in Washington with many of the people who were&#13;
then involved in the embryonic study of education and development. I met an old Ford Foundation&#13;
friend, Ken Iverson, who was recruiting somebody to go on a Bank mission to Colombia. I went,&#13;
although I didn't think I knew anything about education as such. But we had a good mission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    This was part of an economic review of Colombia, one of the periodic ones, and my chapter on&#13;
education was well received. It's just by coincidence the Bank at that time was opening up a small unit&#13;
in education, and I was invited to be a part of it. It was then led by Ricardo Diez-Hochleitner, on loan&#13;
from UNESCO. With his departure after a stated period I became chief of what was by then a&#13;
division. So this is how I got into the Bank. Had I tried to say on leaving Robert College, where I'd&#13;
been President, what did I want to do, I would have said, "I want to work in the international field but&#13;
on a broader basis than one institution." Well, by pure luck .that's what fell into my hands. So here I&#13;
was doing something I would have wanted to do but in an area where there were in fact no road maps.&#13;
There was no prior experience, to my knowledge, by anybody that would have defmed how you go&#13;
about fmancing education on the scale that the World Bank was accustomed to fmance things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Perhaps I could ask at this point why was it that the Bank became interested in education. I&#13;
suppose it was in 1960-1961 that this interest frrst surfaced. Financing began in 1962.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTiNE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: It was at that point that Diez-Hochleitner was seconded from UNESCO. What were the&#13;
major reasons for this emerging interest in education? I gather it was controversial at the time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTiNE: Wei~ I've always felt myself that the main thing that drew the Bank's attention to the&#13;
need to support education was the fact that its own projects often were delayed or made more difficult&#13;
by the lack of sufficiently skilled manpower, administrative or technical or whatever, to execute a&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                         -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(BALLANTINE)&#13;
project. They came right into ftrst-hand contact with the inadequacy of people to carry on&#13;
development, so that very soon this problem of manpower became a pressing one. That was especially&#13;
true where the Bank was really trying to get development into the hands of the countries themselves,&#13;
not just going and building bridges and highways for them on a turn-key basis, but really trying to get&#13;
them involved in the development process. That was true in agriculture, of course, and sectors of that&#13;
kind, where you didn't just move in a big construction company to build something. So that was, that&#13;
was certainly one reason why.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    There was kind a bit of general thought branching out from that. George Woods himself was very&#13;
keen on it, although he defmed very carefully what the Bank ought to do. And throughout those early&#13;
years there was constant reiteration of the criterion that anything we fmanced in education should be&#13;
related to Bank projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: But certainly the beginnings of Bank fmancing came at the end of (Eugene) Black's&#13;
presidency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: They did. That's correct. And there were people in the Bank who were aware that&#13;
there were economic studies. I'm bad on names these days, so they won't readily come to mind, the&#13;
people who were doing a broad kind of rate of return analysis on education levels and things of that&#13;
kind. And a number of Bank economists were aware of these. But, as I say, all of this came gradually&#13;
anyway. Back as far maybe as, oh, 1962 or 1963, is even earlier than that, you fmd people talking about&#13;
the need to do something about manpower.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Yes, but for a lot of people, that in itself wouldn't constitute a case for the Bank being&#13;
involved, just because there was a need amongst the borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: It was many years before everyone thought there was a case for the Bank to be&#13;
involved, especially loan officers, many of whom saw no great beneftt in their work or in their careers&#13;
even, if you will, to push in education, because it was largely a low volume thing. It had a lot of&#13;
unknowns, a lot of pesky problems, and why should they get involved in that kind of junk when&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                         -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
they could work on something that would produce a big loan much more readily. So we weren't all that&#13;
popular, you know, as a candidate for loans. In fact, we had to fight and fight and scratch to get&#13;
people's attention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Is it just a coincidence that with the establishment of IDA as a source of soft loans--credits, if&#13;
you like--education and some other sectors were developed which were regarded by many as soft&#13;
sectors? Do you think that the establishment of IDA in a sense gave the Bank another avenue to&#13;
pursue some of these soft sectors?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Well, I would say, yes, it was just a coincidence that the two came at the same time.&#13;
If you put it the way you did in the second question, did the establishment of IDA provide an&#13;
opportunity to get into another, quote, "soft" area, the answer there would be yes, too. You may recall,&#13;
I gave you the name of Dick Demuth. I guess you just didn't have a chance to talk with him. I talked&#13;
to him on the phone yesterday as I was pondering these things, because I knew that he was very&#13;
familiar with the early years. He felt also, as I already did, that IDA was started for its own reasons.&#13;
There were too many countries that the Bank simply couldn't serve, and yet the Bank had a double&#13;
problem. It has to reach those poorer countries; at the same time it had to establish its own credit.&#13;
And I guess one of Black's major contributions was to go around the country with that Southern charm&#13;
and convince legislatures to authorize the purchase of World Bank bonds in their portfolios. That's&#13;
simply one example of the way he established the Bank's credit, and that was a major step in the&#13;
beginning in the establishment of the Bank. So the Bank had to fmd a way, as I say, to serve the poor&#13;
countries, but at the same time to strengthen and maintain its credit as a borrowing institution. So&#13;
IDA was set up as a separate fund supplied by grants and not borrowing, and as a consequence it could&#13;
move independelltly at greater risks without endangering the credit of the Bank. So that was done.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then there were things like education and I think several other sectors or subsectors that might&#13;
have begun to attract attention at that time. And it's true that having IDA one could get into those&#13;
countries. Indeed in the original concept, among the many restrictions that were imposed on&#13;
education, was that education lending would only be through IDA credits. I guess it was 1963 that&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                         -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
we made the Los Banos loan in the Philippines to the agriculture college there. I can't remember&#13;
whether it was The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times, but I remember reading an editorial&#13;
the day the Executive Directors approved the Los Banos loan congratulating the Bank on having&#13;
liberalized itself to the extent of making a bank loan for education and going on to add that it was&#13;
about time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: You mentioned the Executive Directors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Were they equally enthusiastic, to a man?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: I would say the majority were, because the movement was accepted. However, we&#13;
had three Directors who come to mind who bad very strong convictions about what the Bank should be&#13;
doing and what it should not be doing. And as I have said, the majority felt that the Bank's efforts&#13;
should be in those things, those kinds of education and training which would support development as&#13;
conceived of by the Bank at that time, namely, technical manpower at various levels, science, and so&#13;
forth. I should add that when George Woods first put it to the Board he added general secondary&#13;
education. His theory was that government budgets of the poorer countries would still support primary&#13;
education because there was a big demand, that higher education would be supported by the&#13;
foundations and other aid agencies and the like, and that the secondary field, along with the technical&#13;
and vocational, was the area where attention was most needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I remember 1llso that the people at Rockefeller and Ford both, who were consulted by the Bank as&#13;
to what kind of role it should play, pointed to the secondary field and said this is the most neglected&#13;
area and we with our resources would be a good institution to step in. So for a variety of reasons and&#13;
with advice of various kinds, we did do something that normally Woods would perhaps not have done&#13;
at that time. But he did. And that enabled us to get our feet Â·both into general education, at that level&#13;
at least, and into the technical and vocational areas.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                         -6-&#13;

&#13;
    This paragraph was redacted as a result of disclosure review according&#13;
    to paragraph 83 of the World Bank Policy on Disclosure ~flnforrnation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Well, once the early credits and loans were approved, there must have been considerable&#13;
logistical and management problems in getting started. Problems of stafftng, problems of identifying&#13;
what the borrowers were interested in.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: That's right. Before we get into that, I'd like to cover a few general points which have&#13;
occurred to me which tend to affect almost any question you can ask. The first I have sort of alluded to&#13;
already, that education as a sector of development was completely new. Developing education was not,&#13;
but education, as a part of the process of development conceived and being worked on by the Bank,&#13;
was new. Nobody had ever done this before. There were no roadmaps. There were no or very few&#13;
previous studies or writings. As I say, there had been some writing on the rate of return, but only in a&#13;
very broad way. (Theodore] Shultz was one of them, and there was another feUow, who name still slips&#13;
my mind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Harbison, perhaps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Well, Harbison had written a lot about manpower, as had Charles Myers. He was a&#13;
coUeague of mine at MIT when I taught there. I'd say Harbison at that time was perhaps one of the&#13;
leading people. And, of course, Phil Coombs was already into the field too, and he was to play&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                        -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Perhaps there were some members of the Board at the time who were a little skeptical.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Oh, yes. Well, I don't remember any Board member, even your own compatriot Mr.&#13;
[J. 0.] Stone, who flatly rejected all education, although be came about as close as anybody did.&#13;
Several of them, however, were very emphatic about adhering closely to the technical, vocational line&#13;
and in support of other Bank projects. Dr. [Otto] Donner, the German Director, [Pieter] Lieftinck, the&#13;
Director for the Netherlands and other countries in that group, were the most consistently outspoken.&#13;
They were tough critics. They were good critics. They were honest. They were sincere. They meant&#13;
what they said and so forth. Even though you didn't agree with them, you had to respect them, and you&#13;
darned well bad to be prepared for them, because you knew they were going to come at you in the&#13;
Board meetings .. So that kind of potential opposition was good for us.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Well, once the early credits and loans were approved, there must have been considerable&#13;
logistical and management problems in getting started. Problems of staffmg, problems of identifying&#13;
what the borrowers were interested in.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: That's right. Before we get into that, I'd like to cover a few general points which have&#13;
occurred to me which tend to affect almost any question you can ask. The first I have sort of alluded to&#13;

but education, as a part of the process of development conceived and being worked on by the Bank,&#13;

previous studies or writings. As I say, there bad been some writing on the rate of return, but only in a&#13;
very broad way. [Theodore] Shultz was one of them, and there was another fellow, who name still slips&#13;
my mind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Harbison, perhaps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Well, Harbison bad written a lot about manpower, as had Charles Myers. He was a&#13;
colleague of mine at MIT when I taught there. I'd say Harbison at that time was perhaps one of the&#13;
leading people. And, of course, Phil Coombs was already into the field too, and he was to play&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                          -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
a major role later. Well, that's the first one. There were no roadmaps, so we had to learn on the job.&#13;
If I might add, it was like prostitution. It's the only way you can learn the job. So we learned as we&#13;
went, and we learned largely out of our own experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The second point I'd make is that, beginning very narrowly, subsequent years were just a steady&#13;
broadening, bit by bit from experience, from seizing opportunities. Sometimes that policy was being&#13;
made by fait accompli, at least the directors began to think so with [RobertS.] McNamara. Indeed,&#13;
that is what gave rise to the first education sector working paper, as we called it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    If you want, I'll digress with a little personal business. I was on a mission to Africa which was to be&#13;
followed by a month in Turkey, and when I got to Ethiopia, I guess, I got a cable which read as follows:&#13;
"Upon completion of your vacation, return to the Bank in time to prepare a sector policy paper for&#13;
submission to the Board on August 8."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: This was in 1971?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Yes, I guess it was. Well, this was just about the 4th of July, and it was obviously&#13;
impossible. So I went to Turkey where my family already bad gone, awaiting me to come and spend a&#13;
month there, and I said, "I'm sorry. I've got to go back." I spent a few days there seeing family and&#13;
friends and the like and headed on home. And I wrote the paper in four days. I think that's its greatest&#13;
achievement. But in any case, something came up and then the presentation to the Board was&#13;
postponed several times. Well, I was a good soldier up until then, but it made me mad that I was&#13;
bustled back when the people who were telling me to do that could just as well have said to McNamara,&#13;
and I know they did on other occasions for other people, "Well, he has a leave or be has a special&#13;
reason that he can't be here." So that's bow the paper got written. I'm never going to forget it. Now,&#13;
to come back to the paper itself. Go ahead.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: I wonder if we're jumping ahead a little too quickly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Yes, I think we are.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                         -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: I had a couple of points to ask you about the early years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Let's go back then.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: I had started to make the point about some of the logistical problems of getting started. The&#13;
Bank seemed to rely very heavily on UNESCO in those early days. And, in fact, in 1964 the&#13;
Cooperative Program with UNESCO was launched. Do you have any comments about some of these&#13;
difficulties in the early years and particularly on the effectiveness of the arrangements with UNESCO?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Yes, I do. Let me just sort of trace quickly the major efforts to get hold of a policy.&#13;
As I say, the defmition as sanctioned by the Board was very narrow and had to be very closely related&#13;
to other Bank projects. And that was put forth first by Hugh Ripman, I believe, in whose division as it&#13;
was then called, we were first launched. However, the E.D.'s were still not satisfied nor, was it clear&#13;
that education was something you could lend for. Someone, I don't know who, came up with the idea&#13;
that Bank profits, or maybe something like $10 million of them a year, might be put aside. This would&#13;
have been partly public relations and made certain people feel better who charged that we weren't&#13;
helping people. So they got hold of Dr. Harvie Branscomb, who had been President of Vanderbilt&#13;
University, and Branscomb conducted a study and a lot of interviews. Those of us who were already on&#13;
the scene--this included Ricardo Diez-Hochleitner and me and three or four others--well, I guess we&#13;
cooperated with Branscomb, but we really weren't happy to see him there because we felt he was on a&#13;
different tack. We felt that education ought to be lendable and that this was a digression. Be that as it&#13;
may, Branscomb carne up with what he had been asked to do, with suggestions as to how to spend&#13;
some sum of money each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: As grants?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: As grants. Oh, maybe an occasional loan, but really that wasn't part of it.&#13;
Meanwhile, the Directors had been giving thought to what to do with Bank profits. We were making&#13;
profits, and it was clear we probably were going to keep on making profits. And if grants to education&#13;
were a way to take the stain out of that, was there not some better way to do it? Well, then came&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                        -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
the idea that some of the Bank profits could be allocated to IDA. And that idea began to take hold.&#13;
And, in fact, it was the one. So the rug was just--not by anybody's fault--pulled right out from under&#13;
poor Harvie Brancomb. He didn't take it very kindly, and I don't blame him, because he felt that&#13;
Woods had done him in. In any case, his report and recommendations became a dead issue. And so&#13;
we went on then and Woods finally presented a policy paper to the Board. This was back in the early&#13;
1960s, 1963 perhaps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: 1963.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: And in that he first outlined what became the original though narrow basis of&#13;
education lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now, I did tell you about how the 1971 paper originated. What was it? It was essentially an&#13;
attempt to codify and to put down coherently the policy lines under which we had been operating and&#13;
some bit of rationale for educational lending and so forth. As I say, Woods had given his approval, and&#13;
he received the Board's approval, to lend for secondary education, technical, vocational education, at&#13;
various levels. And, in fact, by that time we were deep into the early projects. Tunisia, which was&#13;
secondary technical; Pakistan, which had two agricultural universities, and so forth. And Los&#13;
Banos. We'd started work on that one too. There were quite a number of restrictions, and one sort of&#13;
popped up out of the air. Again I'll have to go into certain more personal things, although I have to say&#13;
that one comment I'll make about George Woods is purely speculative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Anyway, Woods was very suspicious of universities and particularly of university Presidents. He'd&#13;
been on the board of the Rockefeller Foundation and was convinced that the people who came in&#13;
there, mainly Presidents to beg for money, played a kind of shell game in which you never knew where&#13;
the money would be. They'd say it was for one thing, and it would probably defray the costs of&#13;
something else, if only indirectly. Nevertheless, he was just distrustful. Woods himself was not a&#13;
university man, and I think it's a great tribute to the guy that he was as good as he was, because he was&#13;
excellent in many respects and had achieved what he had without the benefit of a college education.&#13;
He'd been to some sort of school of commerce, I think, and learned a bit about fmance. And, of&#13;
course, in his own working experience he learned a lot more.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                         -10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
    But whether that made him also distrustful of university people, I don't know, but be was very&#13;
clear that while we had supported the agricultural universities, that was in places where the technical or&#13;
vocational, professional studies were the total work of that university. To put it another way, Woods&#13;
would have agreed to the fmancing of a project at MIT, but be would not have agreed to fmancing&#13;
engineering at the University of Illinois. This was really a very arbitrary but very ftrm position.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Well, I bad occasion to write a paper for him which was presented and discussed in his close, small&#13;
advisory group. I think it was just after the middle of the 1960s. About five or six people. Then I was&#13;
invited to come and talk about it. Well, I had recommended that we be allowed to support the teaching&#13;
of secondary school teachers, and since we were supporting secondary schools that had to be done in&#13;
universities. So we should be allowed to fmance facilities and other help for science and math and&#13;
secondary teachers in general. That was all right. Woods agreed that was a logical follow-on to&#13;
fmancing secondary schools. Then I tried to get him to remove his objection to fmancing engineering&#13;
at Illinois. No. Pretty soon I could see that the other people, Burke Knapp and the other people at the&#13;
meeting agreed, with me probably, but nobody was arguing. And Woods was getting more and more&#13;
excited. Dumb me, I just kept on arguing with him, because I thought this was so illogical. At no time&#13;
did anybody get bitter or nasty, but fmally he sort of ended it by saying, "Duncan, you're going to be in&#13;
this bank a long time after I'm gone, and you'll do it then but not now." And be was absolutely right on&#13;
both counts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    This I think gives something of the flavor of the role that Woods could play. He could be a white&#13;
knight in many cases, and he could also let his own personal predilections govern at other times. So&#13;
there we are.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Well, now we can perhaps come back to your questions again. You were asking about how Bank&#13;
policy developed. And more particularly you were asking about the UNESCO thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Yes, my point was about the difficulties you faced in starting virtually from scratch, and then&#13;
how did UNESCO come into the action? How effective were the arrangements with UNESCO?&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                         Â·11Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Well, let's come to the staffrng thing frrst. As I said, there were no roadmaps and&#13;
there were no people who really had experience in education as part of development. Naturally we bad&#13;
to get people who bad educational experience of one sort or another of the normal kind. We needed&#13;
economists to make us respectable in the Bank and to actually treat this as an economic activity. We&#13;
needed architects because, although this wasn't realized fully at frrst, it very soon became apparent that&#13;
most of the money would go into civil works and building and so forth. We needed equipment&#13;
specialists, but there were none. And that remained always a major problem: bow can either we or the&#13;
borrower, deal with equipment procurement in a sensible way?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Well, we recruited people from a variety of sources. Some like me came out of what you might&#13;
call an international background, wanting to work in this area and seizing on this as an opportunity.&#13;
This was also a time of fairly rapid liquidation of the British Empire, in Africa especially, so that quite a&#13;
lot of what you might call ex-colonials turned up who bad been education officers in Nigeria and Kenya&#13;
and various of the other countries now becoming independent. And there was a good number of&#13;
people of varying degrees of quality, but some of them very good. And we got a lot of benefit out of&#13;
that happenstance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We needed economists, and there were some interested in this area which was beginning to open&#13;
up. There were some who were perfectly willing to work in it because it was a job in the Bank, and&#13;
there wasn't at that time, you know, another economist's job available. So we were looking for them&#13;
and we got some of them. We had a varied experience with architects. My impression, and I could be&#13;
wrong, is that we had a fairly high turnover in the early days. We used consultants quite a bit because&#13;
we didn't know how many we were going to need, but ultimately we settled on some very good ones&#13;
indeed. David Lewis, who remained with me after the reorganization of 1972, was a frrst class guy.&#13;
And we bad some others too who did a good job in the selection of architects, because we didn't design&#13;
the buildings ourselves but we did supervise the selection of architects. Their main work tended to&#13;
supervision of projects as they went forward. And it took really not a design architect but that kind of&#13;
guy who would pay attention to detail, who was sophisticated enough about business to know when&#13;
there might be some hanky panky down the road or coming up, that kind of thing. Indeed they often&#13;
were able to smoke out impending troubles, and perhaps there were some they never did. But anyway,&#13;
that was one of their jobs, and several of them were very good at it.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALlANTINE                                       -12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALI.ANTINE]&#13;
    From UNESCO, of course, we got some recruits. One of our very best people was a J.C. Jones, a&#13;
really famous character in Bank educational history. He had been the President, I think they called&#13;
him, of the London Polytechnic who had promised himself to retire at age 55. He was the son of a&#13;
Welsh coal miner. A great guy. He did it all himself and he was a very able man, a very nice man.&#13;
Well, at age 55 he retired, but then he started working for UNESCO as a consultant, and that brougbt&#13;
him into our camp. And then he became almost a full time staff member. Although many times I tried&#13;
to recruit him permanently, I couldn't do it, because he wanted his independence. But I think he&#13;
worked until he was 82 or some incredible age like that. But he's an example. There were other&#13;
people like that who came in, who had done jobs in the field for UNESCO, and we got hold of some of&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: What about the formal links with UNESCO?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: There were still many of the E.D.'s who thougbt that we weren't genuine educators,&#13;
that we were really just a bunch of guys who had drifted along, and that somehow or other the Bank&#13;
was not getting the benefit of the best quality. Some of them tended to regard UNESCO as the place&#13;
to go for education. Bear in mind again the distinction I've drawn between education and education in&#13;
development, because that latter was something that UNESCO had very little experience in because&#13;
they didn't know anything about development. But, nevertheless, a lot of pressure was put on that we&#13;
should be using UNESCO. Indeed the feeling was strong that all of the technical assistance provided&#13;
in Bank loans, if there was to be any, should be executed by UNESCO. There was a feeling also that&#13;
they should be indentifying and appraising the projects, and all the Bank would do would be to look at&#13;
the economic aspects and write the checks and so forth, and that by and large this was the sort of&#13;
specialized job that a specialized UN agency--that is to say, UNESCO--could handle better than&#13;
another specialized agency like the Bank, which was not educational.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So several of the senior Bank officers were appointed to negotiate an agreement. If I recall, Rene&#13;
Maheu (Director-General of UNESCO at the time] migbt also have made an initiative to which Woods&#13;
responded because of the feeling on the Board. So they got together. Ricardo Diez-Hochleitner and&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                          -13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
Demuth were the main negotiators and the cooperative agreement was reached, that the Bank would&#13;
mainly finance projects with a relatively small input of work from UNESCO. UNESCO set up a group&#13;
of--! forget how many there were at the start. It ultimately came to be about thirty people, plus a&#13;
supplementary group that never amounted to anything, who would be concerned mainly with the&#13;
identification of projects. They would do sector studies, and out of these the Bank would pick up items&#13;
that would appeal to it and that it and the country felt were high priority, discuss these with the country,&#13;
and a project would form.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: They were based in UNESCO in Paris?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: They were based in UNESCO. That's a good point, because many of us felt that that&#13;
was one of the great difficulties. However, from the other point of view, if they weren't working out of&#13;
the house--UNESCO--we weren't getting the benefit of UNESCO. Actually, while no group is perfect&#13;
by any means and neither was that one, there were some excellent people. Originally it was understood&#13;
that the Bank would have a voice, at least a chance to comment on the selection of staff. Also it was&#13;
originally understood that the Bank would approve the choice of a Director, although that would lie&#13;
with Rene Maheu. That point was sustained until much later. It no longer is in effect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The first point we haggled about a bit in particular cases. Maheu wanted to appoint somebody and&#13;
we might not like it, and then an argument would ensue. It would get settled somehow or other.&#13;
Somebody would give in, but at least it gave us a chance to scrutinize people. Once they were on the&#13;
staff, we knew it was impossible to get rid of them. This was what made us determined. Nobody in&#13;
UNESCO wanted to move off that staff. It was a real nice job for UNESCO people, because in&#13;
UNESCO either _you're stuck in Paris or you're stuck in the field. And getting back to Paris from the&#13;
field is very difficult, and getting out so you can see what it is you're doing is also difficult because they&#13;
didn't have the kind of travel system that the Bank had. So this was highly regarded, you know, and the&#13;
salaries were good. That is to say, they worked on UNESCO rates but their rank tended to be higher&#13;
than it would otherwise have been. And promotions and so forth were pretty good. So it was very&#13;
important that this not become too much of a political thing. I have to speak very plainly here, but I&#13;
think it's weU understood that UNESCO has always been plagued by the politics of appointment. We&#13;
knew that when the Bank went in, and we set up the best safeguards we could. And by and large they&#13;
were successful, at least for a certain time.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                           -14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(BALLANTINE]&#13;
        So that was sort of how it got started. Of course, there's plenty of documentation about this, and I&#13;
won't go into the later review of the Cooperative Program with UNESCO except to say that, well, just&#13;
to put it very plainly, you could ask any question about the successes and failures and experience of the&#13;
Cooperative Program except one, and that was whether it should continue to exist. And that question&#13;
was ruled out. Partly, of course, because another factor almost from the beginning was criticism that it&#13;
was poaching on another UN agency's territory. And for that reason the Bank had to offer cooperation&#13;
with UNESCO. I think once having done it, it was for that reason also almost impossible--! wish it&#13;
weren't--to get out of it. But right now--I'll put it right on the line--and for a long time, for reasons I&#13;
can go into later, the Bank is paying 2 million dollars or more per year for something that doesn't give&#13;
it one penny worth of benefit. In fact, it may be even worse than that. It may be a deficit of benefit.&#13;
And that's still respecting some of the people who are still in it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        The connection with UNESCO, I might add, and it later developed when we ourselves got into&#13;
more statistical approaches to the development process, especially when we wrote that second, 1974&#13;
education paper, we found the statistical branch of UNESCO to be by far the best thing there was.&#13;
They were excellent. Their material was good. I had a high respect for those people. There wasn't any&#13;
other agency in the world anywhere that could match the stuff that they put at our disposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Perhaps we could talk about Robert McNamara. Commentators all agree that he made an&#13;
enormous impact on the content, style, and management of Bank operations. How did all of this show&#13;
in the education sector?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Oh, it was great. It was great. I hope I've given recognition to George Woods for the&#13;
good qualities that he had, because he did. But with McNamara it was really a breath of fresh air.&#13;
There's a certain paragraph I discovered in the QED's [Operations Evaluation Department] review of&#13;
those 55 projects that it analyzed that I remember writing aJ].d talking about a lot. Basically what it said&#13;
was--and this came into McNamara's statement to the Board--that projects should be selected on the&#13;
on the basis of their priority, upon the needs for development in that country, and not by any a priori&#13;
established area of eligibility. In other words, if they needed lessons in baby care, if that was the clear&#13;
priority for development--I'm being extreme, obviously--then it should be the development needs and&#13;
possibilities of the country that determined priorities, and not the fact that we do this but we don't do&#13;
that.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                        -15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
    Well, this in a way represents the change that came in the transition from Woods to McNamara,&#13;
because McNamara was a manager supreme, and he looked to you as a manager. And although he&#13;
wasn't a bloodthirsty guy by any means, he expected you to be able to do your job and to give him the&#13;
advice or the professional judgment that he could use. So he left it to you. Personally, of course,&#13;
you've probably heard, he was a very odd man. My phrase for it always was that while McNamara&#13;
might sometimes have difficulty relating to individuals, he did relate to humanity. And very strongly. 1&#13;
don't hold to the view that some had that McNamara was expiating the Bay of Pigs. I don't think so. I&#13;
think that there was a turn in his life, an opportunity came along, and the guy had such imagination and&#13;
such reach that when he took hold of the Bank, he saw a chance to really do something. And I think he&#13;
really did. I'm among his strongest supporters, although dealing with him was difficult, not easy. He&#13;
never was rude to anybody that I ever saw. He never openly expressed dissatisfaction except he'd look&#13;
at you as if you'd suddenly crawled out from under a rock. I'm glad to say I don't remember him&#13;
looking at me that way, but you can see him look across a table at a meeting or something like that and&#13;
on came that black stare--in other words, I hear what you say. That was Woods' expression, but it&#13;
came out of McNamara's eyes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So it was, "Ballantine, you're in charge of education. Tell me what you think." If he didn't like it,&#13;
he'd disagree. Fortunately, however, most of us there in what was then a department were just very&#13;
strongly in favor of the general McNamara approach, the poverty, social equity approach. And we saw&#13;
an opportunity to mold Bank policy within that broad framework and to express it in terms of&#13;
educational development, so without discarding at all, because it was essential, the technical/vocational&#13;
bias, and the like, and the secondary education about which we were sometimes unhappy because it&#13;
tended to be too much preparation for Oxford and Cambridge which for the countries was totally&#13;
irrelevant. But this gave us a chance to talk more and do more about basic education, whether it was&#13;
formal or non-formal. There came, as you are aware, this big thrust into primary education, among&#13;
other things, and less successful efforts, but some, at basic, non-formal education. We certainly worked&#13;
at it. We went and we talked to people. I used to go to these countries and I'd always seek out&#13;
whoever was supposed to be in charge of non-formal education. Generally, you were disappointed,&#13;
because you found that what they didn't have was a ministry of education or any schools or teachers,&#13;
but they were trying to do the same thing that a formal educational system would do. There were very&#13;
few that had thought about what you would do within that context.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                         -16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
     Literacy programs? I don't think we actually supported those to a great extent, but we certainly&#13;
favored them. We did feel maybe that's the kind of thing that ought to be more homegrown and there&#13;
were, you know, some very good ones.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: I think on occas.on literacy programs were built in as components of other&#13;
projects--agriculture and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Well, that was another development that came along, the training. When we were a&#13;
department, we acquired a training division, which gradually built up to six or eight fellows, specialists&#13;
in agriculture, water, power and various other things, who worked with a department like Agriculture&#13;
and so forth to have components of their projects deal with training. That was not just literacy, of&#13;
course, but it was often agricultural basic training and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: I suppose you were hinting at a possible gap between Bank thinking about these new areas of&#13;
lending and borrower willingness to take them on board. I suppose the important statements of policy&#13;
were the 1971 and 1974 Education Sector Working Papers which you have already mentioned. How&#13;
would you compare and contrast them, and how did they impact upon the Bank-borrower dialogue?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Well, the 1971 paper, as I may have suggested earlier, wasessentially just a&#13;
formulation of what we were doing. It pushed for a few things we weren't yet allowed to do, or at least&#13;
that got into the draft on a kind of conjectural basis, just sort of obiter dicta comments as to what might&#13;
be needed. But basically it was a fairly orthodox statement. I had two collaborators on the 1974 paper,&#13;
but the one that I felt really, was helpful was Necat Eder, a Turk who was with us as a consultant.&#13;
Well, maybe he -was on the staff. I guess he was, because he was with us for several years. He was a&#13;
very able fellow who had been in Turkey's Economic Development Ministry in a quite good position.&#13;
Just a very bright guy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Now, that second paper became a philosophical rationale, in terms of education, for what&#13;
McNamara was trying to do with the Bank as a whole for all developing countries. The emphasis&#13;
pointed very sharply toward the poorest, the lowest 40 percent we kept talking about, and toward those&#13;
kinds of assistance that they needed and could handle. Essentially the paper set forth a new policy&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                         Â·17Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
which was a radical departure from previous efforts to clone for developing countries the systens of&#13;
advanced countries. Education should be more relevant to the countries' own needs and priorities.&#13;
Greater attention should be given to the poor, which generally meant rural populations. This entailed&#13;
more primary, and sometimes more non-formal, education. Given the scarcity of resources, greater&#13;
efficiency was essential, and thus, changes in structure, curriculum, testing. promotion policies, â&#128;¢ ,uity,&#13;
relevance, efficiency, etcetera. Above all, project assistance should reflect the country's own situation&#13;
and not some arbitrary, a priori preference of the Bank. This was the fundamental point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The paper created a stir within the Bank and outside. Internally, it wasn't so important because&#13;
McNamara was already creating that stir himself. He'd set the scene in a way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Let me speak of other places where it created a stir. Among the more straight-line educational&#13;
people, it was, in some cases, looked at with horror. I had a very good friend who was active in British&#13;
circles in education development, Peter Williams. And Peter took to the journals and wrote diatribe&#13;
after diatribe condemning it. He even convened a meeting of British and American people involved&#13;
because there were, of course, a number of them, which simply tore into this paper. He had asked me&#13;
for some supporting documents, and I sent them, to him quite naively assuming he just wanted some&#13;
information. He actually wanted something that he could stab in the back. Later we patched up our&#13;
disagreements, but they were very active for a while.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: What were his major difficulties with the paper?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: There were so many. He felt that our assessment of the low enrollment ratios in&#13;
primary education was unjust, unlair. In part he was right. Some progress had been made and would&#13;
follow, but it certainly wasn't being made at a rate which we felt was either necessary or possible. And&#13;
here was where our statistical back-up from UNESCO was very conclusive. The emphasis we wanted to&#13;
place on the expansion of primary was warranted. Another major difference concerned relevance--the&#13;
cloning of advanced country models. This became a fairly celebrated debate in various journals in&#13;
which point by point the differences were elaborated--too fully to summarize here.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                          -18-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Well, they're there in Prospects in 1976.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Yes, Prospects was the magazine. And they are also in a number of the documents&#13;
and the like. Also I complained that I was never invited to that conference. I felt that it was a little&#13;
unfair to gather together a group of critics and not let me defend the report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Now, to move on to the question of how people in UNESCO reacted to the paper. Well, I would&#13;
say of the people in UNESCO's Education Financing Division two or three or so may have been&#13;
embarrassed vis-a-vis their colleagues in the house as a whole. The majority agreed with us. Of people&#13;
not in that division in UNESCO, by and large they were at first skeptical. Above all, even with the&#13;
people in the division, there was the feeling very strongly that it was not proper, to put it mildly, for the&#13;
Bank to have issued such a paper without consulting with or assistance from UNESCO. It was not&#13;
entirely true that we bad done it on our own; there bad been extensive consultation with the countries.&#13;
Some of the UNESCO people felt very strongly about it. You know, they probably were right. We&#13;
were being a tittle bit Bank-ish and high-handed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Now further, that criticism also was made by some people who had experience in the countries and&#13;
felt that we hadn't consulted the countries either. Well, I took up that point in answering Peter&#13;
Williams, arguing that after all our life was largely a life of consulting with the countries. We knew&#13;
what they thought and wanted, since at that time so many of the higher officers were still graduates of&#13;
Oxford, Cambridge and the like. They had had that kind of educational background themselves or--if&#13;
they had gone to the local university--it was attempting to be like Oxford and Cambridge, so it wasn't&#13;
all that much different. So when we branched off what had been the mainstream of education to the&#13;
degree we did, by implication as well, we were giving offense. We knew it, but we felt this was what we&#13;
should be doing and saying.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Now, to what extent, you are asking, did the people we dealt with in project identification pick up&#13;
the priorities that we were proposing? I would say, yes, in terms of the subsector that we were&#13;
proposing to fmancing more heavily, namely primary education, also efforts at some kind of basic or&#13;
non-formal or adult education. The latter never proceeded as well or as fast as the primary education.&#13;
But we began to build an awful lot of schools. And I can remember one of the projects carrying 200&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                         -19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BALLANTINE]&#13;
primers [primary schools] and thinking, "Gee, we're really in big business now." And then we had one&#13;
that had 500. I don't know what's happened since I left, but we were rapidly moving up from a very low&#13;
percentage of the money going to primary education to a pretty substantial percentage, nearly 20&#13;
percent, which was important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So I don't think there was as ready a turn to what we thought ought to be going on in those&#13;
primary classrooms as we would have liked. Nyerere, of course, had written a famous paper on what&#13;
kind of education ought to be given right from the primary level up through secondary. That was really&#13;
a very strong critique of what Africa in general was doing inside its schools. Yes, it was building&#13;
schools and so forth, but what was it teaching and how did one level of education relate to another?&#13;
Well, the fact was that the primary started it off in the direction of Oxford, and never really got out of&#13;
that rut. So, yes, there was a big social equity push. There was a big rural, a big poverty push. And&#13;
those aspects of the paper, which were fundamental, did get a good response.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: The reorganization of the Bank in 1972 saw the large Education Projects Department under&#13;
your leadership split up into relatively autonomous regional divisions. You remained in charge of a&#13;
much smaller core policy group. Could you comment on this experience and possible lessons for the&#13;
Bank from this change?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Now, I'd want to keep those two very separate. I'll deal with the frrst question in a&#13;
fairly personal way, partly because I was the only one of the department heads under the previous&#13;
organization who remained on, whose department had been regionalized. Not all departments were&#13;
regionalized, perhaps four of the largest ones: Agriculture, Education, two others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I remember then the senior staff were gathered together for the frrst presentation of the McKinsey&#13;
fmdings and recommendations. And it was clear that McNamara was going to buy them, and right&#13;
away the thought formulated in my mind: I don't think the separation of policy and operations is a good&#13;
idea. I still don't think it was, although I'm not prepared to say that it produced a lot of bad effects,&#13;
partly because I don't know enough. Obviously the Bank hasn't chosen to go back to the previous&#13;
arrangement, and there were many criticisms of the previous arrangement. Obviously, if you want to&#13;
increase volume, you can't give too much power to a bunch of picky project people. And I remember&#13;
&amp;#12;    BALLANTINE                                          -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    [BALLANTINE]&#13;
    one Director being very angry in a Board meeting, complaining about project perfectionism. And this&#13;
    would come, you see, in the course of reviews of how long it took for projects to get executed or even&#13;
    identified or whatever the case, you know. And obviously project perfectionism was one of our&#13;
    inherent traits or faults, and loan officerswho wanted to get on with it and didn't care that much about&#13;
    project perfection would often find us a pain in the neck. Well, in other words, there was a certain kind&#13;
    of built-in tension but it was regarded by many as creative tension--and we had a lot of phrases for&#13;
    things at that time--with these two more or less equal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         You see, back a few years before what had been the project divisions had been raised to the level&#13;
    of departments, you had the so-called area departments and the project departments on the same&#13;
    footing in the structure of the Bank and that was done with a purpose. Simon Aldewereld scored a&#13;
    great triumph when he brought all his divisions up to the level of the departments. We loved it too.&#13;
    But I think the feeling had become general that the area people, who were supposed to comprehend&#13;
    everything, including things that project people wouldn't think about, namely the basic relation with the&#13;
    country and so forth, should have a slightly higher position. Also, that the Bank had become so big that&#13;
    you had to decentralize down from the top. McNamara and Burke Knapp and the Loan Committee&#13;
    could not really manage that much, so you needed a level of regional Vice Presidents and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        So for these reasons the changes were made, and obviously there were reasons for the change that&#13;
    went far beyond my own negative reactions. Somebody might have said to me, "Yes, that's true but&#13;
    these other considerations are stronger." Anyway, the effect on the Education Department, as you say,&#13;
    was to strip it of its operational functions but to give it something blithely called functional control. It&#13;
    didn't mean a damn. It meant the right to criticize what had been done, which often came to be felt as&#13;
    carping constantly. It meant that operations sometimes lost sight of policy considerations, and policy&#13;
    considerations iD tum were not drawn out of the operational experience as much as they should have&#13;
    been. So I think both the operations and the policies tended to suffer. Not having enough to do except&#13;
    for the expanding training division which remained in the Education Department, you know, because&#13;
    you couldn't write policy papers every day. Actually we were released and were able to do the 1974&#13;
    paper, which we'd never have been able to do if we were still following projects all the time. But we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢&#13;
&amp;#12;BALlANTINE                                        -21-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(BALlANTINE]&#13;
tended to lean more on research. And while there were a couple of studies that I think were very&#13;
worthwhile, there were at least twice that many that didn't matter at all and on which the Bank was&#13;
spending money. I won't name anybody. There were some that just really weren't very useful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: What about project evaluation? OED was established in the mid-1970s. How were your&#13;
relations with OED and how helpful did you fmd OED project audits?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: First of all, let me say it was a three-cornered relationship. Or to put it another way,&#13;
OED had relations with the regional people and also with us. Their relations with the regional people&#13;
were more important and more bitter. When they criticized the regional people, reactions were&#13;
stronger and feeling were hurt more than with us, even tllough they might have been criticizing&#13;
something that we had done too. Secondly, you had, you might say, three different kinds of project&#13;
evaluation. You had first of all the project completion report, which was supposed to be done right&#13;
away. There was the OED report, the project performance audit report, which again was supposed to&#13;
be done very early, fairly prompt. Otherwise, it wouldn't be valuable. And then there was a third one,&#13;
and I forget who did that. I don't think too many of them ever got done. This was in depth, where you&#13;
were attempting to evaluate not the process of the project but the ultimate effects of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: These are the so-called Impact Evaluation Reports?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALlANTINE: Yes. Yes, I guess that's the term we used. Well, am I right that not too many of&#13;
those ever got done?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Indeed. The first one dealt with University of the Philippines at Los Banos, and of course,&#13;
appeared possibiY ten years after the completion of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALlANTINE: WeD, that was the first of the impact studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Right at the end of your time at the Bank, in 1977 and 1978, OED prepared its review of&#13;
Bank operations in the education sector, which looked right back to 1962 and summed up experience&#13;
since then.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                          -22-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Yes, that brief little history is good too. It helped me to remember a lot of things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: How did you react at the time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALlANTINE: At the time? I wasn't in the Bank at the time it was published. But I think 1 wrote&#13;
something on this too because my copy was all marked up and I'd obviously read it fairly carefully. It's&#13;
hard not to put together my present thoughts and my thoughts at the time. I'm not normally a person&#13;
who reacts sensitively to criticism. "What the hell?" is my general attitude. And while this is very&#13;
critical, it is by and large accurate, I think. At least it has gone into that kind of evaluation a lot more&#13;
deeply than I ever did or anybody else I know. So in a sense I'm more or less prepared to accept the&#13;
thing on face value. Most of it. I think it's fair in the sense that it pointed out the things that we all did&#13;
wrong. It also pretty frequently points out the special difficulty that existed in the case of education.&#13;
For example, on procurement of equipment. Nobody could solve that. We hired specialists. We had&#13;
borrowers hire specialists. We did everything. We had some organization that bought in large volume.&#13;
There was an international agency that used to buy equipment. It was perhaps the most knowledgeable&#13;
in large scale equipment procurement. We had them working for us. We did everything we could&#13;
think of and we never really get control of that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I was astounded by ligures on the length of time it took to identify a project, to get it to the Board,&#13;
and then, horror of horrors, to get it executed. We weren't all that bad, but we were worse than most&#13;
other sectors in the Bank, I think. Why? Well, certainly we were not hiring U.S. Steel to build a bridge&#13;
over the Bosphorus. These were not tum-key operations. You were working with very primitive&#13;
executive capacity, especially when we got into the rural area. The projects weren't big enough to draw&#13;
in a contractor from outside if he wasn't already set up in the country doing some other job. So you&#13;
were dependent on local people who had neither the efficiency of international professionals nor, in&#13;
some cases, the integrity that they might have had either. We had to cope with a lot of local stuff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I remember that in Ethiopia, the frrst project, we were only building about ten schools. They had&#13;
bidders, and one name tended to appear very frequently, either as the frrst part ofthe name or the&#13;
second part. Of course, these were just different combinations of the same people to pay lip service to&#13;
&amp;#12;.. -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       BALLANTINE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       [BALLANTINE]&#13;
       the idea of international competitive bidding. Thev SJid. Â·weil, .,,,. h,,-. e r, â&#128;¢ restrict it. We don't have&#13;
       the ability to handle a lot of bids." But !lur guy went in and s.1id. Well.:" Â·uÂ·re going to have to." And&#13;
       the prices fell almost immediately by about 5tl percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           That is kind of thing you had to deal with. and 1\lU weren't sure that 1ou always were able to. It&#13;
       was one of the things we had to work at. I may hJve gone off the track again ....&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       JONES: Not at all. I wonder if the status of the educ.Jtion sector in the Bank was hindered in any way&#13;
       by the absence of any clear cut rate of return methodc&gt;lllgy for educatilln projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       BALLANTINE: Well, as I may have said earlier. from the beginning the lack of a rate of return meant&#13;
       it wasn't an economic thing for many Bank people. especially the more conservative who grew up in the&#13;
       banking business or Wall Street or some other country's cxchJ.ngc. It was sociaJ, or it was&#13;
       consumption. Not investment and so forth. We found a lot of that. Onlv gradually did people in the&#13;
       Bank--l'm thinking of E.D.'s and senior officers. the more consef\ati&lt;.e--come to say, "Well, maybe it&#13;
       doesn't matter." Never did they say "You do have a rate ,,f return          ou can have one; or the like.&#13;
       Bernard Chadenet was a very conventional man in a lot of ways, al          Â·ugh he supported us. But he was&#13;
       always after us to undertake a study or to try an experimental rate         ccturn in a given project and so&#13;
       forth, which we did. We undertook the study--at least one--and we c:d         J   number of them. Los Banos&#13;
       in fact had an attempt. It didn't amount to anything. I forget whether we deleted it from the project&#13;
       report or not, but Jim Baldwin, who was the economist on that missil'n. Jid make an effort to-strike a&#13;
       rate of return. Well, I have a vague feeling we deleted it from the linJI report because it would have&#13;
       been so open to criticism on technical grounds that to present it would be worse than nothing. But&#13;
       maybe we didn't. Maybe we left it in. I forget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           However, gradually people just got used to the fact that .... Yllu ,n,&gt;w, when I joined the Bank I&#13;
       was told by one of the chief personnel officers that if you came in for .m interview with a beard, forget&#13;
       it. Forget it. Well, I would compare this rate of return to the beard. y,,u know, people gradually&#13;
       realized that it wasn't all that bad. It was okay. So they kind of got 01erv. helmed.&#13;
&amp;#12;BALLANTINE                                           -24-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
JONES: Well, we've covered a lot of ground today, and there's much we haven't had time to look at,&#13;
but before we conclude I wonder if there are any other matters you'd like to raise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BALLANTINE: Yes, I'd like to make a closing statement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I worked for the Bank longer than I ever worked for any organization in my life. It was 17, 18&#13;
years altogether, it was the last job I ever held. I can't say I wielded more responsibility, because as a&#13;
college President I had an even broader responsibility and more people involved, in terms of dollars&#13;
certainly. It was a lot bigger. But it was an opportunity to be at the cutting edge of what I believed and&#13;
still believe are tremendously significant things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Whatever solution may be found to the world's growing indebtedness the Bank will be involved.&#13;
You know, I read the papers and I know about the Baker initiatives and Bill Bradley's viewpoint and so&#13;
forth, and I'm not getting into that. Whatever it is, the World Bank has a place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Secondly, I've been lucky all my life in being associated with things that I could regard as high&#13;
grade. I went to college at Amherst, which was a small but very good liberal arts college. I did&#13;
graduate work at Harvard and so forth, and I taught at MIT and places where the students and the&#13;
colleagues and so forth were all first class. You come into the Bank. Those people certainly were all&#13;
first class, too. This was a very high grade organization. You weren't allowed to dish out any nonsense&#13;
or trash. It wasn't a vicious organization in the sense that people were out to get you, although we had&#13;
some tough fights. There were some people whose methods I didn't, wasn't prepare to, condone, but&#13;
that's minor. This was a tremendously enriching and satisfying experience. This was a tremendous&#13;
responsibility. Although I did have bosses who had to approve of what I did this was a chance to&#13;
exercise great initiative and responsibility, especially with McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Also, the quality of leadership was special. You don't find many people as imaginative as&#13;
McNamara. And you don't find any person you enjoy working under more than Burke Knapp. He was&#13;
a real gentleman. He is still. And we were good friends. We played tennis at the same Bank group&#13;
and so forth. I valued that association, and many others, extremely highly. And now in the autumn of&#13;
my life, if not the winter, I look back on this as a great experience and as a great institution, period.&#13;

&#13;
        JONES: WcU, it's been fascinating. Thank you very much indeed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        BALlANTINE: WeD, I appreciate a chance to say what I just said for the record, and above aD, the&#13;
        rest of it is for whatever use it is to anybody else.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

            Duncan S. Ballantine held on November 21, 1986
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In November 1986, Duncan S. Ballantine
            was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives
            oral history program by Phillip Jones. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1963 to 1977, Mr. Ballantine worked in the
            following areas: in the education projects department as
            director (1963-1968) and in the education department as
            director (1969-1976) and as senior advisor (1977). Under its
            various guises and titles, the education department was led
            by Duncan Ballantine until his retirement. Mr. Ballantine
            discusses the early difficulties in financing education, the
            1963 loan to Los Banos in the Philippines, and the reaction
            thereafter of the executive directors. His transcript
            discusses his guidance to liberalize criteria for financing
            developing countries in education, a sector which grew
            substantially both in size and scope during his tenure.
