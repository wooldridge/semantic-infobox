&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Policymakers in many countries, including the Russian Federation, are attempting to encourage&#13;
fertility as part of their response to the challenge of population aging. Whether pro-natalist policies&#13;
will be effective depends crucially on how well they address the underlying causes of low fertility and&#13;
barriers to larger family size. While in some countries in Western Europe postponing childbearing&#13;
and increased childlessness seem to be driving the fertility decline, these factors do not appear to be&#13;
as influential in Russia. Instead, the problem seems to be the relatively low frequency of second and&#13;
higher-order births, which persists despite major changes to pro-natalist policies introduced in 2007&#13;
and the prevalence of the two-child ideal of family size. This study analyzes current and prospective&#13;
fertility trends in contemporary Russia, with special attention to second-child birth dynamics and its&#13;
determinants. Stable employment and accessibility of formal childcare options are found to be factors&#13;
that are correlated with mothersâ&#128;&#153; preferences for additional children and the probability that they&#13;
will have a second child. In light of this observation and international experience, a menu of policies&#13;
to improve work-family balance is suggested.&#13;

&amp;#12;    I.       INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
Population aging is a global trend, and Russia is no exception. According to the World Economic&#13;
Forum (2011), the share of people over 60 in the global population has risen from about 8 percent in&#13;
1950 to 11 percent and is expected to reach 22 percent by 2050. In Russia, this share had already&#13;
reached 19 percent by 2013, up from 15 percent in 1989. A population is considered to be relatively&#13;
old when the share over 65 is more than 8â&#128;&#147;10 percent (Kinsella and Velkoff 2001). In 2013, this share&#13;
in Russia constituted about 13 percent of the total Russian population, a 35 percent increase from&#13;
9.6 percent in 1989. The share has been quite stable for the last decade, but Rosstat projects that it&#13;
will reach about 19 percent by 2031.&#13;
&#13;
While population aging reflects in part a significant achievement in terms of increased&#13;
longevity, it can cause problems for economic development and put a strain on social&#13;
insurance systems. Longer life expectancy is a cause for celebration, especially after precipitous&#13;
falls in this indicator during Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s transition period in the 1990s. Still, as discussed in the&#13;
companion study on active aging (Levin 2015), population aging everywhere raises concerns about&#13;
the sustainability of economic development as some societies experience both aging and shrinking&#13;
working-age population, causing increased burdens on financial and healthcare systems. Many&#13;
countries, Russia among them, still rely heavily on pay-as-you-go pension systems that use social&#13;
security contributions of current workers to fund pensions for retirees. Deterioration of dependency&#13;
ratiosâ&#128;&#148;the number of working people per pensionerâ&#128;&#148;calls into question the fiscal sustainability of&#13;
such systems. The statutory retirement age for old-age labor pensions in Russia is relatively low (60&#13;
for men and 55 for women), which makes the situation even more troubling.&#13;
&#13;
Policymakers in many countries, including Russia, use pro-natalist policies to stimulate&#13;
fertility and thus slow the aging of the population. Two main factors can contribute to population&#13;
aging: (1) a decrease in the number of children (lower fertility) and (2) an increase in the number of&#13;
elderly (higher longevity). As life expectancy in Russia continues to rise, the pace of population aging&#13;
will intensify and pro-natalist policies may become increasingly attractive. Many countries, like&#13;
Russia, already have in place policy instruments to support childbearing. One of the most widely used&#13;
measures is higher payments during maternity leave and an extended duration of the leave. Currently&#13;
across Europe maternity leave ranges from 90 days in Iceland to 410 days in Bulgaria; some countries&#13;
provide full compensation for the motherâ&#128;&#153;s pre-maternity earnings while others (such as Ireland, the&#13;
United Kingdom, and Slovakia) provide a share of such earnings or a flat-rate benefit.1 Other common&#13;
policy measures are cash transfers (paid either one time at birth or regularly during parental leave),&#13;
tax deductions, and housing allowances.&#13;
&#13;
The effectiveness of pro-natalist policies in stimulating fertility and in slowing population&#13;
aging can be disputed. (1) There is a significant lag between when a child is born and when that&#13;
child enters the labor force; thus, even if successful todayâ&#128;&#153;s pro-natalist policies will not have an effect&#13;
&#13;

                                                                            FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA          3&#13;
&amp;#12;on economic output for at least two decades. Immigration policy can provide a more immediate&#13;
payoff in terms of compensating for an aging workforce and thus improve the domestic demographic&#13;
situation. However, immigration has its own challenges. It can only postpone the impacts of&#13;
population aging because more and more immigrants would be needed to sustain economic growth.&#13;
(2) There is no consensus in studies of family policies about whether family policies are effective in&#13;
raising fertility. While some have shown that child-related cash transfers stimulate childbearing by&#13;
reducing the associated costs (Dâ&#128;&#153;Addio and Mira dâ&#128;&#153;Ercole 2005), others have demonstrated that&#13;
birth-related payments do not seem to be effective at raising birth rates (Luci-Greulich and ThÃ©venon&#13;
2013). Significant increases in parental leave, as in Austria in 1990, can stimulate fertility, but they&#13;
can also have unintended consequences, such as drawing women out of the labor force for extended&#13;
periods, or even indefinitely (Lalive and Zweimuller 2005). Rather than specific single measures,&#13;
what seems to matter more for reproductive behavior is a combination of family-friendly policy&#13;
measures, with the most promising directed to making motherhood and participation in the formal&#13;
labor force more compatible (Kohler, Billari, and Ortega 2006).&#13;
&#13;
This study examines current pro-natalist policies in Russia and suggests policy options to help&#13;
make them more effective. Since 2007, Russia has been among the countries with the most active&#13;
family policies, aimed at raising the proportion of families with two and more children. The objective&#13;
of this study is to analyze current and future constraints on fertility, assess current policy&#13;
instruments in light of those constraints, and suggest options for making family policies more&#13;
effective in achieving their goals. The study is structured as follows: Section II describes fertility&#13;
trends in post-Soviet Russia. Section III provides possible explanations for the current low fertility&#13;
rates, and Section IV uses a panel household survey (Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey [RLMS])&#13;
to examine factors that correlate with Russian mothersâ&#128;&#153; decisions to have a second child. Section V&#13;
reviews the package of pro-natalist measures introduced in 2007. Section VI analyzes fertility&#13;
projections, focusing on the extent to which current trends can be sustained, and Section VII&#13;
concludes with policy recommendations stemming from the analysis.&#13;

&#13;
   II. FERTILITY TRENDS IN CONTEMPORARY RUSSIA&#13;
Though Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s population has been declining since 1992, the decline may now be over.&#13;
Between 1992 and 2012, the population fell by about 5.2 million people. The nadir of births was&#13;
reached in 1999, when 1.22 million children were born, and deaths peaked in 2003, when 2.37&#13;
million people died. According to the United Nations Population Division, the rate of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s natural&#13;
increase in population in 1990â&#128;&#147;2005 was among the lowest in the worldâ&#128;&#148;higher only than in&#13;
Bulgaria, Latvia, and Ukraine. Unlike other countries in the region, migration to Russia, mainly from&#13;
Central Asia, has been partly compensating for the precipitous natural decrease in population. In&#13;
2013, for the first time since 1991, Russia recorded a natural, though small, increase in its population&#13;
(by 22,900 people).&#13;
&#13;
Population size and structure, as well as fertility rates, vary considerably from region to&#13;
region in the Russian Federation. The North Caucasus, Tatarstan, and Yakutia have had sustained&#13;
natural population growth; meanwhile, in some areas of Northwest Russia and the Central Federal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA      4&#13;
&amp;#12;Okrug, the death rate exceeds the birth rate by more than 50 percent. In 2013, in half of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regions (40, including two capitals, which together account for 56 percent of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s population) the&#13;
number of births registered exceeded the number of deaths; in the other 40 regions, the opposite&#13;
was the case. Such variability can be explained by cultural differences (larger families in regions with&#13;
Muslim-majority populations); economic differences (the richest city, Moscow, saw its population&#13;
increase); environmental differences; and differences in the level of regional support to families with&#13;
children.&#13;
&#13;
Fertility patterns have been changing over time, and these dynamics reverberate in the age&#13;
structure of todayâ&#128;&#153;s population. Russia has seen several waves of demographic transformation.&#13;
The first significant drop in the number of newborns in the 1960s (see Figure 1) was caused by two&#13;
factors: (1) the 1955 abolition of the abortion ban, which had been in place since 1936, and more&#13;
importantly, (2) the â&#128;&#156;war echoâ&#128;&#157;: there were smaller cohorts of women in the most reproductive age&#13;
group (20â&#128;&#147;29 years) because fewer children were born during World War II. Total fertility rates also&#13;
started to decline, falling from 2.5 in 1960 to about 2 by the end of the 1960s (Frejka and Zakharov&#13;
2012). Family support measures introduced in the early 1980s were associated with a rise in both&#13;
number of births and total fertility rate, which reached 2.2 in 1987 (Frejka and Zakharov 2012).&#13;
&#13;
The social and economic hardship of the 1990s resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union&#13;
reversed the positive fertility trends of the 1980s. The breakup of the Soviet Union and&#13;
subsequent major social and economic transformation in Russia, with poverty and inequality both&#13;
rising, changed the demographic landscape one more time. All fertility indicators declined in the&#13;
1990s, with the total fertility rate bottoming out at 1.16 in 1999. Births declined by more than 60&#13;
percent, especially among mothers aged 25 or less. Another major phenomenon observed in the&#13;
1990s was the almost doubling of extramarital births and a decline in the number of abortions by&#13;
about 80 percent due to greater availability of modern contraceptives.&#13;

&amp;#12;Starting in 2000, economic stabilization and recovery of some postponed births led to a rise&#13;
in fertility. As the economic decline, hyperinflation, and instability of the 1990s faded into history,&#13;
more and more women born in the mid-1960s or the 1970s who had reached their early 30s and late&#13;
20s could afford to become mothers for the first or second time.2 The fertility rate increased for all&#13;
women aged 25 and older, with the largest increase among women over 30. As a result, the mean age&#13;
at birth went up from 25.6 years in 1999 to 26.6 in 2006. Postponement of childbearing in Russia&#13;
started with the mid-1960s cohort and continued thereafter (Frejka and Zakharov 2012). For&#13;
example, while the cumulative cohort fertility rate (CCFR)3 for women born in 1964 who had children&#13;
when they were 15â&#128;&#147;25 was 1.17 births, the CCFR for women born in 1982 who had children at 15â&#128;&#147;&#13;
25 was just 0.7.&#13;
&#13;
New government policies to encourage larger families took effect in 2007. Though there were&#13;
more births, fertility rates were still below the replacement rate of 2. In 2006 the total fertility rate&#13;
was 1.31â&#128;&#148;not much higher than its historic minimum of 1.16 in 1999. Low fertility coupled with&#13;
high death rates led the number of Russians to fall, which attracted the attention of the federal&#13;
government. The Duma ratified policies to support families with children at the end of 2006; their&#13;
focus was on stimulating second and higher-order births, with child-related income transfers to&#13;
mothers or other caregivers becoming differentiated by childâ&#128;&#153;s birth order. The policies are discussed&#13;
in detail below.&#13;
&#13;
Fertility has risen significantly since the family policy package was introduced. Five years after&#13;
the new measures became operational, the number of births had risen from less than 1.5 million in&#13;
2006 to more than 1.9 million in 2012, and the total fertility rate went up by more than 30 percent,&#13;
from 1.31 to 1.69. The largest increase was recorded in the first two years after the new family policy&#13;
measures were introduced; in 2007 the rate was up by 8.5 percent and in 2008 by 6.1 percent.&#13;
Women over 30 having the second or third child contributed most to rising fertility rates, suggesting&#13;
that the policies achieved their objective. Today, however, as will be discussed later, the effect of the&#13;
measures seems to be fading out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    III. EXPLAINING LOW FERTILITY IN RUSSIA:&#13;
         CHILDLESSNESS OR ONE-CHILD FAMILIES?&#13;
Many European countries experienced declining fertility rates in the final decades of the 20th&#13;
century. Rates in traditionally high-fertility countries like Greece and Spain plunged, from levels&#13;
above 2.2 in 1980 to barely 1.25 by 2002 (Kohler et al. 2006). Similar drops were observed in post-&#13;
socialist countries like Poland and Romania and in former Soviet Union countries. Scandinavian&#13;
countries, on the other hand, were able to improve their demographic situation and currently&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2 There appears to be a significant correlation (about 0.59) between growth in births and growth in gross domestic&#13;
product (GDP) between 1990 and 2013.&#13;
3 CCFR is defined as the average number of children per woman of a cohort of women who passed through their childbearing&#13;
&#13;
years; it is calculated by summing the age-specific fertility rate for each of the calendar years in which these women were of&#13;
childbearing age. For example, the CCFR for women in the 1964 cohort when they were 15â&#128;&#147;25 years is calculated by summing the&#13;
fertility rates for 15-year-olds in 1979, 16-year-olds in 1980, and so on, up to 25-year-olds in 1989.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA             6&#13;

Note: Cohort fertility rate refers to the number of children actually born per woman in a cohort of women by&#13;
the end of their childbearing years.&#13;
* Other than 1965 cohorts data: Australia (1962â&#128;&#147;1966); England and Wales, Sweden (1960); Greece, Portugal,&#13;
and Spain (1963); Hungary (1964); Norway (1953); and United States (1953).&#13;

While childlessness and delayed childbearing matter a great deal in European countries, they&#13;
are not common in Russia. Whereas the share of childless women is high in countries like Italy,&#13;
England, and Netherlands, the share in Russia is relatively low: according to the 2010 Census, only&#13;
about 6 percent of women who completed their years of fertility had no biological children, down&#13;
from 6.4 percent in the 2002 Census. Moreover, in Russia and other post-communist countries, the&#13;
process of postponing childbearing started later than in Western Europe, and thus the average age&#13;
at first birth is still lower than in many European countries. According to the United Nations&#13;
Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the average age at first birth in Russia was 24.6 in 2009&#13;
while in most Western European countries it exceeded 28. Childlessness and delayed childbearing&#13;
do not seem to be fundamental causes of low fertility in Russia.&#13;

&amp;#12;  Box 1. Causes of Low Fertility in Europe&#13;
&#13;
  While it is an important factor in some European countries, childlessness alone cannot explain&#13;
  falling fertility rates across Europe. Experts and policymakers concerned with the decline in fertility&#13;
  rates have been examining possible causes of the decline. Since reported fertility rates are averaged&#13;
  across all women of childbearing age (by period or by cohort), their decline can be explained by higher&#13;
  childlessness, fewer children per mother, or a combination of these factors. If the first explanation&#13;
  prevails, very low fertility should be associated with higher rates of childlessness. This is not the case&#13;
  for most countries; childlessness is found to be reasonably comparable among countries with different&#13;
  fertility rates and across time for the same country (Breton and Prioux 2009; Greulich et al. 2014). Even&#13;
  in very low-fertility countries â&#128;&#156;the biological, social and economic incentives for children are&#13;
  sufficiently strong that most women (or couples) desire to have at leas t one childâ&#128;&#157; (Kohler et al. 2006).&#13;
&#13;
  Delayed childbearing, fueled in part by uncertainty in young adulthood, is the most important&#13;
  force driving the fertility decline. Even though the share of childless women is high in some countries&#13;
  like Italy, the vast majority of women do decide to give birth. However, in countries with very low&#13;
  fertility, like Italy, it seems that the first (and often the only) child is born to mothers at an increasingly&#13;
  late age. Such delayed childbearing is generally attributed to (1) changes in attitudes toward family, the&#13;
  â&#128;&#156;second demographic transitionâ&#128;&#157;; (2) higher educational attainment of women; and (3) uncertainty&#13;
  among young adults about future prospects in terms of employment, housing, and other living&#13;
  conditions (Billari 2008).&#13;
&#13;
  Smaller families are a distinguishing feature of low-fertility countries in Europe. Delayed&#13;
  childbearing is not a problem per se but it may prevent women from attaining the desired number of&#13;
  children, thus lowering fertility rates. If that is the case, countries where there is more postponement&#13;
  of childbearing would have families with fewer children and hence lower fertility rates. Indeed,&#13;
  countries where the mean age at first birth is higher than 28 (for example, Italy and Spain) have a&#13;
  relatively large proportion of families with at most two children. In general, countries with low fertility&#13;
  have lower shares of families with two or more children (Greulich et al. 2014).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Russia, the main factor contributing to low fertility is the high prevalence of one-child&#13;
families. According to Frejka and Zakharov (2012), the main factor in the decline in fertility rates for&#13;
women born in the 1960s and 1970s was the significant decrease in the number of second and&#13;
subsequent births. By 2010, the share of larger families had declined: more than two-thirds of&#13;
Russian families had only one child (67.5 percent of families, up from 50.8 percent in 2002); and two-&#13;
child families represented just over 25 percent of families. When achieved fertility of the 1965 cohort&#13;
is compared across countries, Russia has the highest share of one-child families (37 percent of all&#13;
families) and its prevalence of multi-child families is the second-lowest (55 percent), above only Italy.&#13;
As propensity for having a second and third child seems to distinguish low-fertility from high-fertility&#13;
countries (Greulich et al. 2014), the low prevalence of multi-child families appears to be a driving&#13;
force behind Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s low fertility rate.&#13;
&#13;
Yet for most Russians, the desired family size is two children; thus, policy can be directed to&#13;
enabling Russian families to fulfill this aspiration. Even though many families have stopped at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA             8&#13;
&amp;#12;one child, many Russians report wanting two. According to the survey conducted in 2012,4 only about&#13;
12 percent of women and men want to have a single child (Figure 3, panel A). Slightly more than half&#13;
of women (51.7 percent) and 47.8 percent of men would like two children, provided conditions&#13;
(housing, financial resources, and time) are adequate, and 24.9 percent of women and 23.3 percent&#13;
of men want three children. However, when asked about the expected number of children, only 13.3&#13;
percent of women and 14.6 percent of men expect to end up with three; more than one-fifth (24.2&#13;
percent of women and 21.8 percent of men) think they will have only one child. The difference&#13;
between the average number of children desired (2.29) and the average expected (1.92) defines the&#13;
gap between actual and potential fertility in Russia (Figure 3, panel B). Compared to other countries,&#13;
the gap between intended and realized children is relatively small, which leaves less scope for policy&#13;
interventions to stimulate fertility (Figure 4). It also illustrates the point that, given the preferences&#13;
of the majority of the population, striving to increase fertility beyond two children may be a difficult,&#13;
if not impossible, task.&#13;

      IV. DETERMINANTS OF THE DECISION TO HAVE A&#13;
          SECOND CHILD&#13;
&#13;
Many factors may affect the propensity of a woman to have a second child. If more second-order&#13;
births are necessary to increase fertility, it is important to understand what factors are associated&#13;
with making that decision. These can be grouped into five categories: (1) Motherâ&#128;&#153;s characteristics,&#13;
such as age, labor market status, education, marital status, and the age of the first child. (2) Partnerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
characteristics, in particular labor market status and earnings. (3) Household characteristics, such as&#13;
monthly income, wealth, housing conditions (ownership, size, amenities), and presence of an&#13;
informal childcare provider (such as a grandparent). (4) The social and economic environment, such&#13;
as local unemployment rate, poverty level, etc. (5) Government policies that support families with&#13;
children.&#13;
&#13;
Women face a trade-off between motherhood and work. Desire for a professional career or the&#13;
need to contribute to the household income can raise the opportunity cost of children, especially&#13;
where work and family are difficult to reconcile. A woman with one child has plenty of information&#13;
about the time and costs involved in childcare and the extent of the motherhood penalty; hence, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                        FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA       10&#13;
&amp;#12;ability to combine work and family can have a significant effect on the desire and propensity to have&#13;
a second child. Low fertility in some European countries is often linked to difficulties in reconciling&#13;
work and family (KÃ¶ppen 2006; Greulich et al. 2014). Whether such a tradeoff exists in Russia is&#13;
analyzed below using household survey data; Box 2 gives details on the data and the methodology&#13;
used in the analysis. Note that while this analysis can indicate significant associations between&#13;
certain characteristics and behaviors, it cannot establish causal relationships.&#13;
&#13;
The desire to have a second child in Russia appears to be positively correlated with income&#13;
and with having the first child in formal childcare. Based on bivariate associations, women who&#13;
report wanting a second child are more likely to reside in richer households, particularly ones where&#13;
the men earn higher wages compared to women who do not want a second child; on the other hand,&#13;
women with second-child aspirations are less likely to be employed and, when they are, they earn&#13;
lower wages than mothers of one child who do not report wanting additional children (Figure 5 and&#13;
Appendix Table A.1). Also, highly-educated women and mothers of a boy are more likely to report&#13;
wanting a second child. Interestingly, women with a first child who attends formal daycare are more&#13;
likely to want a second child.&#13;
&#13;
Women who had a second child during the study period also differ from those who remained&#13;
with one child. The same pattern of differences is observed between two groups of women of&#13;
reproductive age (15â&#128;&#147;44 years)â&#128;&#148;those who had a second child between 2005 and 2012 and those&#13;
who had only one child by the end of the period. Thus women who did not have a second child are&#13;
more likely to currently be working full-time and have higher wages, although the propensity to work&#13;
in stable employment, as defined by working in the same job for three years or more, is similar for&#13;
the two groups (Figure 6 and Appendix Table A.2). Women who had the second child are more likely&#13;
to have a partner and that partner earns more than partners of women who did not have a second&#13;
child. Also, women who had a second child are more likely to have a boy first and to have the first&#13;
child in formal daycare.&#13;
&#13;
The desire to have a second child is positively associated with use of childcare facilities for the&#13;
first child. Having the first child in formal daycare (reported by 32 percent of the sample) 5 is&#13;
associated with a 5.7 percent higher probability of wanting a second child. Married women and those&#13;
whose first child is male are more likely to want a second child; women aged 30 and above and&#13;
mothers with a school-age first child are less likely to want a second child (Figure 7, panel 1). As&#13;
expected, availability of larger housing is positively associated with the desire to have a second child.&#13;

Note: The size of the bar is proportional to the difference in the given characteristic between the two groups,&#13;
with women who do not want/did not have second child used for comparison. For example, 60 percent of&#13;
mothers who do not want a second child have a partner, while 75 percent of mothers who want a second child&#13;
are married or living with a partner, which implies a 25 percent difference in this characteristic between the&#13;
two groups. Red bars indicate larger shares of women with these attributes among women who want/gave&#13;
birth to a second child, while blue bars indicate larger shares among women who do not want/did not have a&#13;
second child. The stars identify statistically-significant differences in means between the two groups: * p&lt;0.1,&#13;

&amp;#12;Box 2. Empirical Analysis of Aspirations for and Arrival of a Second Child&#13;
&#13;
Data&#13;
The analysis of intentions for and arrival of second children uses 2004â&#128;&#147;12 waves of the RLMS, which contain information&#13;
on a representative sample of the Russian households.&#13;
&#13;
Since the intent is to analyze determinants of the desire and decision to have a second child, the sample was restricted&#13;
to 3,292 women of reproductive age (15â&#128;&#147;44 years) who already had one child when they entered the sample. Since&#13;
information on fertility aspirations is available only for the 2006â&#128;&#147;10 rounds, the initial sample for the analysis of desire&#13;
to have a second child is 5,088 observations of 1,194 first-time mothers; in 45 percent of these observations, first-time&#13;
mothers reported wanting a second child (59 percent of first-time mothers reporting wanting a second child in at least&#13;
one of the waves). For analysis of decisions to have a second child, the panel aspect of the data was used to see if any of&#13;
the first-time mothers had a second child by the next wave of the survey. The initial sample has 4,846 observations of&#13;
1,844 first-time mothers; 221 observations (4.5 percent of all observations, 12 percent of all first-time mothers)&#13;
reported a second child at some point between 2005 and 2012. Notably, of first-time mothers who reported wanting a&#13;
second child at any point between 2005 and 2012, only 11 percent realized this desire in the study period. The gap&#13;
between intentions and realizations varies a lot across age groups, reaching its maximum for the 20â&#128;&#147;24 age group.&#13;

X        Characteristics of the mother (age, education, labor market status) and her first-born child (age and gender).&#13;
         Following Greulich et al. (2014) and AdserÃ  (2011), a proxy of â&#128;&#152;stable employmentâ&#128;&#153; is included, which is&#13;
         defined as working at the same job for the last 3 years.&#13;
&#13;
Z        Characteristics of the partner, including presence, education, and labor market status.&#13;
&#13;
H        Housing characteristics: Given the findings of Brainerd (2007) and Chirkova (2013) on the potential&#13;
         importance of housing for fertility in Russia, log housing living space is included along with log of real&#13;
         household expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
W        Family policy variables: The number of days the first-born child attends formal childcare facility is included.&#13;
&#13;
The model also includes round and region fixed effects ( Roundt and Regionj) as well as a stochastic idiosyncratic shock&#13;
(ui). Notably, the results reflect correlations and not necessarily causation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA   13&#13;
&amp;#12;Propensity to have a second child is positively associated with the stability of womenâ&#128;&#153;s work.&#13;
Following Greulich et al. (2014), who found that women with stable jobs are more likely to have a&#13;
second child, the results for Russia confirm that, controlling for other factors, stable employment is&#13;
associated with a significantly higher probability of having a second child (Figure 7, panel 2). The&#13;
predicted probability of having a second child for stably-employed mothers is 1.68 percentage points&#13;
higher than for first-time mothers not in stable employment (4.92 percent versus 3.24 percent).&#13;
Larger housing space, higher household expenditures, and having a first child aged 3 years and above&#13;
are all correlated with a higher likelihood of having a second child; having a newborn first child and&#13;
being 35â&#128;&#147;39 years old is associated with a lower probability of having a second child. As with&#13;
Chirkova (2013), a strong daughter preference is found for the second child: women whose first child&#13;
is male are more likely to have a second child. In terms of fertility aspirations, better-educated&#13;
mothers and those whose first children attend formal daycare more often are more likely to want a&#13;
second child. The full estimation results are presented in Table A.3 in the Appendix.&#13;

&amp;#12;    V. ANALYSIS OF CURRENT PRO-NATALIST POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
International evidence on the effectiveness of family policy measures is mixed. Confronted by&#13;
an aging population, many national governments have implemented a wide range of pro-natalist&#13;
policies. The majority of European countries have introduced various forms of support for families&#13;
with children, including financial transfers, measures to balance work and motherhood, and&#13;
legislation protecting women and children. Studies of different countries find mixed evidence on the&#13;
extent to which such a policy can be effective in increasing birth rates and which policies are best&#13;
suited to removing constraints to higher fertility in a given context (Gauthier 2007). The emerging&#13;
evidence suggests that while childcare coverage and family-friendly workplace arrangements are&#13;
conducive to births, the length of maternity leave does not seem to have an effect on the probability&#13;
of having a second child (McDonald 2006; Greulich et al. 2014).&#13;
&#13;
While financial transfers are most popular with policymakers responding to low fertility, the&#13;
effects on birth rates are often short-lived. Pro-natalist policy measures differ in the scope and&#13;
timing of their effect. The first lever used by policymakers aiming to raise fertility is often child-&#13;
related financial support, such as child allowances or birth-related transfers. If they are generous&#13;
enough, such measures can have immediate effects on fertility; however, since these policies often&#13;
affect only the timing of births, not their number, the increases in fertility fade out several years later&#13;
(Gauthier 2007). The evolution of pro-natalist policies then usually progresses to more complex&#13;
policy packages designed to improve the work-life balance, such as increased childcare coverage. For&#13;
example, in 1972 Japan introduced child allowances for the third and fourth children, which did&#13;
nothing to halt the decline in Japanese fertility (Ma 2010). Financial support was then extended to&#13;
families with a second child (1986) and a first child (1992), again with almost no effect. Since the&#13;
mid-1990s, the Japanese government has moved toward policies that increase coverage of daycare&#13;
and family centers and promote greater involvement of fathers in child-rearing, which may have&#13;
reversed the increasing trend toward childlessness among younger Japanese women. Similar&#13;
evolution from a tight focus on financial support to multifaceted policy packages has been observed&#13;
in countries as diverse as Sweden, countries in Central and Eastern Europe, and South Korea.&#13;
&#13;
Are Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s government policies helping to boost second-order births? The existence of the&#13;
fertility gap between the desired and the realized number of children suggests that policies may help&#13;
Russian families fulfill their family size aspirations. Given the importance of stimulating second births&#13;
for raising fertility in Russia and in view of the findings on predictors of wanting and having a second&#13;
child, are current pro-natalist policies likely to achieve their aims?&#13;
&#13;
The demographic crisis became a concern for Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s policymakers by 2006. A major change&#13;
in demographic policies and measures to support families with children was announced in the&#13;
Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly on May 10, 2006. The demographic crisis was called&#13;
â&#128;&#156;the most acute problem of contemporary Russiaâ&#128;&#157; that required â&#128;&#156;effective support programs for&#13;
mothers, children, and families.â&#128;&#157; President Putin named several reasons that discouraged young&#13;
families from having a second or third child: low income, lack of adequate housing, doubts about the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA      15&#13;
&amp;#12;ability to provide the child with decent health care and education, and sometimes doubts about&#13;
having enough resources to feed the child.&#13;
&#13;
From the start, the emphasis was placed squarely on increasing the second-order birth rate.&#13;
The 2006 address proposed specific measures to support young families and women and to stimulate&#13;
second-order births: (1) increasing the amount of the childcare benefit (paid for up to 18 months&#13;
after birth); (2) introducing subsidies for preschool education; (3) increasing the face value of&#13;
maternity certificates;6 and (4) introducing maternal or family capital for the second child (see Box&#13;
3).&#13;
&#13;
The package of pro-natalist measures passed in 2006 and implemented in 2007 put Russia on&#13;
the road to a more active demographic policy. In addition to the presidentâ&#128;&#153;s proposals, measures&#13;
designed to create better conditions for families to give birth and bring up children, maintaining and&#13;
improving their health, were enacted in 2006. The law extended monthly child benefits to non-&#13;
working women (previously, they were available only to working women on maternity leave), with&#13;
payments differentiated by birth order (1,500 RUB a month for the first child, 3,000 RUB for the&#13;
second and each subsequent child). Kindergarten subsidies were also differentiated by birth order:&#13;
while the federal budget covered 20 percent of the preschool fee for the first child, the subsidy&#13;
increased to 50 percent for the second and 70 percent for the third and subsequent children&#13;
(Appendix Table A.4 summarizes policy measures, including their generosity relative to the&#13;
minimum subsistence level for children). In 2008, ad hoc indexation of family support measures was&#13;
replaced by an inflation indexation mechanism for social benefits and payments.&#13;
&#13;
Child-related tax deductions also became differentiated according to child birth order.&#13;
Standard income tax deductions for children in the form of exemption from tax on the parents'&#13;
taxable income depending on the number of dependent children were in effect before the major&#13;
measures were introduced. The deductions were gradually increased from 300 RUB per child per&#13;
month before 2005 to 1,000 RUB starting in January 2009. In 2012, the deduction became&#13;
differentiated by birth order: 1,400 RUB for the first and second child and 3,000 RUB for the third&#13;
and each subsequent child. The deduction is only valid until the month in which cumulative annual&#13;
income reaches a certain cap. From 2005 to 2009, the maximum income was raised from 20,000 to&#13;
40,000 RUB. Starting in 2009, the maximum income was raised to RUB 280,000 (about US$7,800 at&#13;
the current exchange rate).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6 Maternity certificates, financed by the federal budget and introduced in 2006, provide additional incentives for the&#13;
public health care system to deliver quality medical care both to women during pregnancy and childbirth and to infants&#13;
during the first year of life. The initial value of the certificates was 7,000 RUB (2,000 for pregnancy and 5,000 for&#13;
childbirth). In 2007, the nominal value of the certificate was increased to 10,000 RUB (3,000 for pregnancy, 6,000 rubles&#13;
for childbirth, and 1,000 rubles for infant care).&#13;

&amp;#12;Box 3. Maternity (Family) Capital&#13;
&#13;
Maternity (family) capital is administered in the form of a certificate issued upon birth or adoption of a&#13;
second or subsequent child.&#13;
&#13;
Who is eligible?&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·                Woman, citizen of the Russian Federation, who gave birth or adopted a second or subsequent child&#13;
                 after January 1, 2007&#13;
ï&#130;·                Man, citizen of the Russian Federation, sole adopter of the second or subsequent child after January 1,&#13;
                 2007&#13;
ï&#130;·                Father/adoptive parent of the second or subsequent child, regardless of nationality, upon termination&#13;
                 of the right to state support for the woman, who gave birth to or adopted this child, as a result of&#13;
                 termination of parental rights, crimes against children, and so on&#13;
ï&#130;·                Minor (as well as an individual up to age 23 enrolled in university full-time)/Children entitled to shares&#13;
                 if a certificate cannot be obtained by parents/adoptive parents (due to their death or termination of&#13;
                 parental rights/guardianship, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
How much is it?&#13;
&#13;
Maternity capital is by far the most generous family support measure in Russia, starting in 2007 with&#13;
250,000 RUB (over US$9,500). Over time, the amount was continuously raised, more than compensating&#13;
for inflation. By 2014, maternity capital reached 429,400 RUB (over US$12,000 or equivalent to almost 5&#13;
years of the minimum monthly living cost for children, as defined by the government of Russia).&#13;

&#13;
What can it be used for?&#13;
&#13;
(1) Housing improvement: buy housing, pay off mortgage loan, or build a new house&#13;
(2) Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s education: preschool, secondary school, tertiary institutions, and postgraduate course fees&#13;
    and room and board&#13;
(3) Motherâ&#128;&#153;s future funded pension&#13;
In 2009, as a crisis measure, the government allowed families to use a portion of their maternity capital&#13;
(12,000 RUB) for immediate needs; this measure ended in May 2011.&#13;
&#13;
When can it be used?&#13;
&#13;
Three years after the child is born or adopted; although in 2009, a provision was added to allow maternity&#13;
capital to be used for mortgage payments before the childâ&#128;&#153;s third birthday . The amount of the maternity&#13;
capital is determined as of the year of certificate redemption.&#13;
&#13;
The program is in place until December 31, 2016. On average, 700,000 thousand certificates are issued&#13;
every year. As of the beginning of 2013, 37.4 percent of certificate holders used the funds either partially or&#13;
fully, and only around 24 percent used it in full. In the vast majority of cases (96.3 percent) the maternity&#13;
capital was used to improve housing conditions.&#13;

&amp;#12;Regional family support policies complement federal programs. All regions now offer additional&#13;
support measures for families with children, but their scale and coverage vary significantly. For&#13;
example, regional maternity capital ranges from as low as 25,000 RUB in the Nizhny Novgorod region&#13;
to 350,000 RUB in Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District. Other forms of monetary support are&#13;
available to young families, such as lump-sum payment at the childâ&#128;&#153;s birth (often differentiated by&#13;
birth order) and childcare benefits for children not attending daycare. Many regions also have&#13;
programs to help young parents acquire their own homes by paying off some part of the mortgage.&#13;
In 2012, the federal government advised regions to introduce monthly benefits for families that give&#13;
birth to a third and subsequent child until the child reaches the age of 3. The generosity of regional&#13;
family support programs usually depends on the regional budget rather than the severity of the&#13;
demographic crisis. However, in 2013, 50 regions with unfavorable demographic characteristics and&#13;
total fertility rates below the Russian average received up to 90 percent cofinancing from the federal&#13;
budget; the cofinancing is to be reduced to 50 percent by 2018.&#13;
&#13;
Although motherhood-work balance issues are covered in normative documents on&#13;
supporting Russian families, there have been few real achievements. The empirical analysis for&#13;
this study has demonstrated that formal childcare and stable employment of women are positively&#13;
correlated with wanting and having second children. Moreover, flexible work arrangements and&#13;
childcare availability have been found to be more important than cash transfers and maternity leave&#13;
length for stimulating second births in European Union (EU) countries (Greulich et al. 2014; Box 4).&#13;
In Russia, many normative documents (such as the Concept of Demographic Policy of Russian&#13;
Federation up to 2025) incorporate the aim of supporting women in reconciling work and family&#13;
responsibilities. Federal policies to create favorable work-family balance have experienced varying&#13;
degrees of success:&#13;
&#13;
   1) Extension of childcare benefits to fathers. The 1996 Decree on the Main Directions of State&#13;
      Family Policy extended fathersâ&#128;&#153; rights to workplace benefits related to childcare. Fathers are&#13;
      also entitled to maternal (family) capital if the mother is not available due to death, illness, or&#13;
      revocation of maternal rights.&#13;
   2) Working conditions and protection of working mothers. The Russian laws protect the&#13;
      employment rights of pregnant women and women with young children, but these laws are&#13;
      rarely enforced, and courts often dismiss claims of unfair treatment (World Bank 2014).&#13;
   3) Economic incentives for employers to hire those who have large families. These measures are&#13;
      intended to motivate employers to give working mothers flexible schedules, part-time&#13;
      employment, or opportunities to work from home.&#13;
   4) Training opportunities for mothers returning to work. Professional training and skills are&#13;
      offered free to women who have been inactive due to childbirth and childcare. In 2012â&#128;&#147;13,&#13;
      about 23,000 took advantage of these opportunities.&#13;
   5) Better access to preschool facilities. Although there is extensive queuing for spaces in public&#13;
      kindergartens, in Russia private preschools are few: only 2 percent of children in childcare&#13;
      were in nongovernmental facilities (Volosovets 2014).&#13;
   6) Other out-of-school facilities for children. The extensive system of extracurricular activities for&#13;
      children that existed in the Soviet Union, such as summer camps and clubs, was to a large&#13;
      extent destroyed in the 1990s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA      18&#13;
&amp;#12;Generous maternity leave policies keep young mothers out of the labor force for extended&#13;
periods. Womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation in the labor force, which in many countries went up during the 20th&#13;
century, is an important factor in fertility decisions. Russia had inherited from the Soviet Union high&#13;
rates of female labor force participation; since 1990 about 60 percent of working-age women have&#13;
been in the labor force (World Bank, World Development Indicators [WDI]). However, employment&#13;
of mothers with children aged 3 or under is lower in Russia today than it was in the Soviet Union.&#13;
While the transition from planned to market economy can explain some of the decrease, more&#13;
generous maternity and childcare leave is also partly responsible. Childcare leave was substantially&#13;
increased in the early 1980s and currently extends to the childâ&#128;&#153;s third birthday, with the first 18&#13;
months paid (at 100 percent of salary for the first 20 weeks and 40 percent thereafter), and job&#13;
retention guaranteed for the next 18 months. In other countries, such as France, the duration of leave&#13;
is shorter but the motherâ&#128;&#153;s salary is covered for the whole period. Cross-country studies have&#13;
demonstrated that the length of maternity leave does not seem to be correlated with the probability&#13;
of having a second child (McDonald 2006; Greulich et al. 2014). However, Greulich et al. (2014) show&#13;
that a long maternity leave can attenuate the positive correlation between stable employment for the&#13;
mother and the probability of a second child.&#13;
&#13;
Long waiting lists in public preschools make it harder for mothers to return to work earlier.&#13;
Another reason why the Soviet Union might have been able to sustain high fertility rates alongside&#13;
high female labor force participation is more state-provided childcare. In 1990 more than 65 percent&#13;
of children aged 1â&#128;&#147;6 attended preschools, but in the 1990s many preschools were closed and either&#13;
leased or sold to private owners or converted into government offices (for, e.g., the local tax&#13;
administration). This meant that by 2003 this indicator had decreased to 57 percent because of a lack&#13;
of childcare spaces. The number of children awaiting spaces in available preschools soon went up&#13;
more than sixfold: from 193,000 in 1999 to 1,238,000 in 2006 (PailhÃ© and Sinyavskaya 2010).&#13;
According to the most recent Rosstat statistics, from January 2013 almost 2.5 million children were&#13;
on waiting lists for state-run kindergarten.7 Moreover, there is evidence that the quality of services&#13;
in preschool institutions has declined since Soviet times (Savitskaya 2004). The unavailability of&#13;
quality options for childcare provides a partial explanation for high agreement with the statement,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;A preschool child is likely to suffer if his/her mother worksâ&#128;&#157; in Russia; the Generations and Gender&#13;
Survey, conducted in 2004, demonstrated that almost three-quarters of Russians (71.7 percent)&#13;
agreed or strongly agreed with this statement, second only to Georgia and much higher than in&#13;
Western European countries like France, where less than half of the respondents agreed with it.&#13;
&#13;
Care obligations figure prominently in the ability of Russian women to combine family and&#13;
career. There is considerable pressure in Russia for women to put their families first. According to&#13;
the 2008 European Social Survey, about 66 percent of women and almost 70 percent of men agreed&#13;
or strongly agreed with the statement: â&#128;&#156;Women should be prepared to cut down on paid work for the&#13;
sake of familyâ&#128;&#157; (Figure 8a). This is a much higher share than in EU-15/EFTA (European Free Trade&#13;
Area) or ECA (Europe and Central Asia) countries in the study: in the former only a third of&#13;
respondents agreed and in the latter just over half did. Given shortages of accessible childcare&#13;
options, many employed Russian womenâ&#128;&#148;between a quarter and a third, depending on the age&#13;

&amp;#12;groupâ&#128;&#148;work less than they would prefer due to family care obligationsâ&#128;&#148;a much higher share than&#13;
in the EU-15/EFTA countries and higher than the ECA average for women over 35 (see Figure 8b).&#13;
Indeed, the high share of older women expecting to leave employment for care-related reasons&#13;
supports the findings of a study of grandparental childcare across Europe, which based on the&#13;
Generations and Gender Survey found that among all the countries studied, Russian grandparents&#13;
are most likely to provide childcare (Buber-Ennser 2014).&#13;

In Russia, many women return to work because they need to earn money to provide for their&#13;
children. Nevertheless, for the majority of Russians, work-related or career-related issues (no work,&#13;
excessive work load, desire to achieve success in their work, and difficulties in combining work and&#13;
housework) do not seem to be critical to the decision of whether to have another child. In a 2012&#13;
Rosstat opinion poll, the most important factors preventing respondents from having another child&#13;
were financial difficulties (75.4 percent) and uncertainty about the future (71.3 percent). Asked&#13;
about specific policy measures, women assigned more importance to financial support measures&#13;
than to measures for improving the motherhood-work balance. This reveals a more general attitude:&#13;
in assessing the importance of personal goals in life, women assigned a rather low 3.5 (on a 1â&#128;&#147;5 scale)&#13;
to â&#128;&#156;career.â&#128;&#157; This might be explained by gender inequalities in the workplace, manifested in significant&#13;
pay gaps between men and women and reduced opportunities for women to climb the career ladder,&#13;
especially women with children; this is known as the â&#128;&#156;motherhood penaltyâ&#128;&#157;).&#13;

&amp;#12;Box 4. Motherhood-work Balance: Russia and France&#13;
&#13;
European countries with very low fertility are characterized by low compatibility between work and family â&#128;&#148;in&#13;
other words, by high opportunity costs for childbearing (Billari 2008).&#13;
&#13;
France is often cited as an example of a country where women can reconcile motherhood and work. In comparing&#13;
Russia and France on this dimension, PailhÃ© and Sinyavskaya (2010) found that French women enjoy a more&#13;
flexible labor market. For example, part-time employment is much more common in France, where 30 percent of&#13;
working women have part-time jobs, than in Russia, where the figure is only 8 percent (Table B4.1). Fully employed&#13;
French women, on average, also work fewer hours than Russian womenâ&#128;&#148;35 hours versus 41. However, part-time&#13;
work by itself cannot explain differences in fertility rates; for instance, part-time employment in Germany is much&#13;
higher than in France but the German fertility rate (1.36) is far lower than the French (2.03). Greater gender parity&#13;
in France in terms of pay (that is, a smaller pay gap) may also help to explain the fertility rate difference; Russian&#13;
women may feel disempowered and uncertain about being able to provide for future children on their own.&#13;
&#13;
The main difference between the two countries is the labor market participation of women with young children:&#13;
while, in Russia only 25 percent of women whose youngest child is not yet 3 are employed, in France, 57 percent&#13;
of such women work. The difference is even more pronounced for women with children younger than 18 months.&#13;
&#13;
Relatedly, coverage of formal childcare in Russia is more than 25 percent less than in France (and below Germany&#13;
for ages 3â&#128;&#147;5 years). The availability of childcare can be the binding constraint on the labor force participation of&#13;
Russian mothers, and may also figure prominently in the intention to have a second child.&#13;

&amp;#12;Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s pro-natalist policy package is not sufficiently comprehensive to achieve its objectives&#13;
of financial support for young children. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s family policies have focused on financial&#13;
assistance for families with children up to 18 months old) and on securing mothersâ&#128;&#153; jobs through a&#13;
generous maternity leave mandate (Figure 9). Unlike France, which supports mothersâ&#128;&#153; return to the&#13;
labor force through a well-developed network of state-run childcare centers, tax breaks for nannies,&#13;
and unpaid parental leave that can be taken by fathers, in Russia many mothers of 18-month-olds&#13;
have to remain on unpaid maternity leave after joining a long queue for a space in a public&#13;
kindergarten. By focusing on cash transfers and incentivizing mothers to stay at home to take care of&#13;
their children, Russia risks following Germany, which struggles with a very low fertility rate despite&#13;
a heavy investment in lump-sum grants and tax incentives for married couples (Greulich et al. 2014).&#13;
On the other hand, Nordic countries have directed their family policies to supporting working parents&#13;
of small children through expansion of childcare facilities and reliance on short but generously paid&#13;
parental leave, including quotas to encourage fathers to share childcare duties (ThÃ©venon 2011).&#13;
These countries have seen a resurgence of fertility since the mid-1980s (Ronsen 2004).&#13;

                         TO CONTINUE?&#13;
&#13;
Four major factors are driving future birth rates in Russia. The increase in births in the early&#13;
2000s was mainly due to the favorable age structure, which was a result of high fertility rates in the&#13;
mid-1980s. In addition, major social and economic transformation in the 1990s changed family-&#13;
related norms and attitudes, including the timing of having children. Currently, demographers expect&#13;
the number of births to again start declining after 2015 (Figure 10).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The first factor expected to bring down Russian birth rates is the imminent decrease in the&#13;
number of women of peak reproductive age. As already noted, one reason for the recent increase&#13;
in the number of births was that the large 1980s female cohort was entering the peak reproductive&#13;
years of 20â&#128;&#147;29. This age group, which is characterized by a high birth rate (90â&#128;&#147;110 births per 1,000&#13;
women), accounted for 61â&#128;&#147;62 percent of all births in 2010â&#128;&#147;12.8 The number of women in this age&#13;
group peaked in 2009â&#128;&#147;10 at 12.1 million and has already begun to fall (Figure 10). By 2020 this group&#13;
will be down to 7.5 million, and by 2025 it will have been almost halved from the 2010 level.&#13;
&#13;
This factor has already been contributing to a gradual decline in the number of births annually&#13;
since 2011. Within the 20â&#128;&#147;29 age group, those aged 25â&#128;&#147;29 have the highest birth rates (more than&#13;
100 births per 1,000 women per year). This age group peaked at 6.23 million in 2013 and is projected&#13;
to drop to 3.4 million by 2027, 9 which will substantially reduce the number of births in the&#13;
intervening period. While in 2009â&#128;&#147;12 mothers aged 20â&#128;&#147;29 had more than 1.1 million births per year,&#13;

&#13;
                                                                            FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA    23&#13;
&amp;#12;at current levels of age-specific fertility rates, by 2023 this number will fall by about 0.5 million. This&#13;
decline will not be compensated for by women aged 30â&#128;&#147;34, even though the birth rate for that group&#13;
has increased recently, because their number will also start declining after 2018.&#13;
&#13;
The dynamics of marriage frequency aggravate the influence of age structure on future births.&#13;
The number of marriages for brides aged 18â&#128;&#147;24 peaked at 643,000 in 2007 and by 2012 had declined&#13;
by almost a quarter, to 496,000. Moreover, according to Rosstat, since 2012 the number of marriages&#13;
of women aged 25â&#128;&#147;34 has also begun to decline. Even though the share of extramarital births had&#13;
increased from 13 percent in 1988 to 28 percent in 2000 in the 2000s, it stabilized and by 2013 it too&#13;
had decreased, to 23.8 percent. Given the impending age structure dynamics and trends in&#13;
extramarital births, fewer marriages signal a coming reduction in the number of first births per year&#13;
and eventually second births. To preserve the current level of births, a substantial increase in age-&#13;
specific fertility rates must be achieved.&#13;
&#13;
The second factor driving declining birth projections is the end of the fertility transformation.&#13;
Between 2008 and 2012, the age group with the highest birth rates shifted from 20â&#128;&#147;24 to 25â&#128;&#147;29, and&#13;
the gap in birth rates between the age groups is growing. The maximum age-specific fertility rate has&#13;
shifted from ages 22â&#128;&#147;23 to 25, and it is expected to shift further to 26â&#128;&#147;27 (though no further). In rural&#13;
areas, women aged 20â&#128;&#147;24 still have the highest birth rate, but even there, the gap with the second-&#13;
highest group (25â&#128;&#147;29) has narrowed dramatically, from 78 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in 2012.&#13;
&#13;
There has been little recovery of births postponed during the 1990s transition. The evidence&#13;
clearly demonstrates the womenâ&#128;&#153;s attitudes toward family have changed, and particularly toward&#13;
postponement of childbearing. According to Frejka and Zakharov (2012), postponement began in the&#13;
1960s female cohort who entered the most reproductive age in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when&#13;
Russia was undergoing major social and economic transformation. The combination of economic&#13;
hardship, increased information, and access to contraceptives altered womenâ&#128;&#153;s attitudes toward&#13;
family and children. While the fertility rate has been growing since hitting bottom in 1992, only 20&#13;
percent of postponed births have been recovered (Frejka and Zakharov 2012).&#13;
&#13;
The third factor that suggests a decline in future birth rates is the expected fading of the impact&#13;
of the new pro-natalist policies. The beginning of the 21st century was characterized by an increase&#13;
in age-specific birth rates among women older than 25 due to increases in second and higher-order&#13;
births. The growth in the fertility rate of women above 30 significantly exceeded the growth rate for&#13;
those aged 25â&#128;&#147;29. Growth in the fertility rates of older women continued in 2007â&#128;&#147;2012, probably&#13;
influenced by the pro-natalist measures introduced in 2007. With older women more likely to have&#13;
second or higher-order births, the share of second births rose from 30 percent in 2007 to 36.6&#13;
percent in 2012 and of third and higher-order births from 7.6 percent in 2007 to 10.8 percent in&#13;
2012. Yet, although fertility rates surged immediately after the new measures were introduced in&#13;
2007, the year-on-year growth rate has gradually slipped, confirming a fadeout of the new policies&#13;
(Figure 11).&#13;

The new policy measures seem to have had only modest influence on familiesâ&#128;&#153; decisions to&#13;
have a child; they have primarily affected the timing of already-planned births. According to&#13;
the 2013 survey on reproductive intentions, of people who had children after the 2006 pro-natalist&#13;
measures took effect, the majority (57 percent) did not believe those measures had a decisive&#13;
influence on either their decision to have a child or the timing of it. For those who thought that the&#13;
measures did have an effect, almost 75 percent thought the measures brought forward the timing of&#13;
postponed births. Only about 6 percent felt that the measures motivated them to have a child they&#13;
could not otherwise afford. At the same time, the distribution of the answers differed by child birth&#13;
order. The degree of the perceived effect of the policy measures clearly increases with birth order:&#13;
while only 9 percent of the respondents who gave birth to the first child after 2006 reported that&#13;
government support affected the timing of the childâ&#128;&#153;s birth, the percentage more than doubles for&#13;
births of the second and third child (Figure 12). Still, the effect on timing always dominates that of&#13;
motivation for new births.&#13;

The fourth factor that may affect future birth rate dynamics is the completion of fertility by the&#13;
1980s cohort, most of whom come from families with two or more children. Having grown up&#13;
in multi-child families may have affected the fertility intentions of the 1980s cohort, making them&#13;
more responsive to the pro-natalist incentives. According to the 2010 census, of women who were in&#13;
their peak reproductive years in the 1980s (the 50â&#128;&#147;64-year-old mothers of the 1980s birth cohort),&#13;
61â&#128;&#147;67 percent had two or more children (Figure 13).&#13;
&#13;
Introduction of the new pro-natalist measures in 2007 coincided with the 1980s cohort&#13;
reaching peak reproductive age. Women born in 1982â&#128;&#147;87 (a period characterized by high fertility&#13;
and a high proportion of second- and third-order births) celebrated their 25th birthday (the age of&#13;
maximum fertility) in 2007â&#128;&#147;12, just as the new pro-natalist policy measures took effect. Although a&#13;
fifth of the women in this cohort have already given birth to more than one child (Figure 13), it is&#13;
unlikely that the share of women with two and more will exceed 60 percent. The fertility rate for&#13;
subsequent cohorts is expected to be even lower given the smaller share of multi-child families in the&#13;
turbulent times of the late 1980s and early 1990s.&#13;

           VII. MORE EFFECTIVE FAMILY POLICIES FOR RUSSIA&#13;
&#13;
Although pro-natalist policies cannot reverse the population aging trend, they can create a&#13;
supportive environment for people to start and expand their families. The structural factors&#13;
that account for the current Russian age structure are likely to continue shaping future fertility&#13;
dynamics. Policy measures currently in place to stimulate births are likely to have only marginal and&#13;
short-lived effects, mostly bringing forward the timing of intended births rather than generating new&#13;
births; they are unlikely to have a long-term impact on fertility. Still, there is scope for public policy&#13;
to create an environment in which families can achieve their fertility intentions without sacrificing&#13;
their living standards or exacerbating their vulnerability to idiosyncratic or systemic shocks.&#13;
&#13;
Given the fertility intentions of most Russians, policies that focus on the decision to have a&#13;
second child might be most effective. According to the 2012 survey of reproductive health, about&#13;
half of women with one child wanted to have another, though only 15 percent of women with two&#13;
children wanted a third. These preferences suggest that spending public resources on the promotion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA                     27&#13;
&amp;#12;of large families (those with three and more children) may not be effective. Instead, prioritizing&#13;
support and encouragement of second-order births can raise fertility rates without requiring a major&#13;
change in reproductive norms.&#13;
&#13;
The greatest impact on fertility can be achieved with a comprehensive approach directed to&#13;
enabling families to attain their desired family size without exposing themselves to&#13;
immediate or future economic vulnerability. Experience of other countries suggests that more&#13;
effective policies aim not only to increase the fertility rate but also to ensure that high fertility rates&#13;
are maintained; therefore â&#128;&#156;a broad based comprehensive long-term approach is neededâ&#128;&#157; (Frejka and&#13;
Zakharov 2012, emphasis in the original text). Financial transfers would most effectively support the&#13;
living standards of low-income families with children by reducing their vulnerability. For other&#13;
families, fertility can perhaps be best stimulated by measures that promote greater gender equity&#13;
within families and in workplaces and help improve womenâ&#128;&#153;s ability to balance work and&#13;
motherhood (Billari 2008). Such policies might include parental leave for fathers to encourage their&#13;
involvement in childcare, and reduction of the gender pay gap by enhancing womenâ&#128;&#153;s work-related&#13;
skills, removing legal and normative obstacles to women entering occupations traditionally reserved&#13;
for men, introducing quotas to help women break through the glass ceiling, and sponsoring public&#13;
awareness campaigns to reduce gender stereotypes (World Bank 2014). Moreover, given the positive&#13;
association between GDP growth and growth in births observed in recent decades, policies that&#13;
ensure macroeconomic stability can provide Russians with favorable conditions to start and expand&#13;
their families.&#13;
&#13;
Supporting stable employment for both mothers and fathers is important for encouraging&#13;
fertility. The most efficient role for benefits and other forms of financial support for families with&#13;
children is as a safety net that protects families with children from the potentially catastrophic effects&#13;
of income shocks. Also, policies to improve labor market conditions for young parents or potential&#13;
parents can reduce uncertainty and instability, which are anathema to transforming fertility&#13;
intentions into reality. High unemployment rates seem to contribute to postponement and ultimately&#13;
to a reduction in second-order births (AdserÃ  2011). Providing opportunities for skills updating and&#13;
retraining can improve the employability and earnings of both parents, not only relaxing the&#13;
immediate financial constraint on having additional children but also reducing the familyâ&#128;&#153;s future&#13;
vulnerability to shocks. Child-related income tax deductions can also be an effective instrument for&#13;
both encouraging mothersâ&#128;&#153; return to the workforce and enhancing family disposable income. Tax&#13;
exemptions have had a positive impact in the United States (Georgellis and Wall 1992), Canada&#13;
(Zhang, Quan, and van Meerbergen1994), and Taiwan (Huang 2002). To make these deductions more&#13;
effective in stimulating fertility and female labor force participation, their coverage can be expanded&#13;
by switching from the current ceilings on individual salary to a higher household-level threshold,&#13;
which would make more households eligible to take advantage of the policy. Moreover, awareness of&#13;
the policy could be raised through information campaigns, and tax preparation assistance could be&#13;
provided to families with two or more children. Finally, optimization of the length of maternity leave&#13;
can be considered; excessively long leave can have negative repercussions on mothersâ&#128;&#153; return to the&#13;
labor market due to human capital depreciation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       FAMILY POLICIES IN RUSSIA      28&#13;
&amp;#12;Besides being important for investment in the human capital of future generations, increased&#13;
availability and affordability of quality childcare would also make it easier for women to&#13;
combine motherhood and work. There is robust evidence that greater access to childcare can have&#13;
a positive effect on the probability of first and higher-order birthsâ&#128;&#148;see, for example, BaizÃ¡n 2009 for&#13;
Spain; Del Boca et al. 2003 for Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, and Spain; and Bauernschuster et al. 2013&#13;
for Germany. The last study found that a 10 percent increase in German public childcare coverage by&#13;
itself was associated with a 3.2 percent rise in the fertility rate. Long waiting lists for public&#13;
kindergartens in Russia and lack of private options for childcare create major obstacles for the return&#13;
of mothers with young children to work. Better utilization of demographic projections by regional&#13;
governments would allow for more appropriate planning of kindergarten facilities, such as&#13;
construction of new spaces or expansion of existing facilities. Innovative approaches to building&#13;
design and use and regulatory reform can both support the creation of more efficient multi-use&#13;
facilities that could also enable the preschool system to adapt to future demographic fluctuations.&#13;
Increased support of alternative forms of early childhood development (ECD) centers, such as home-&#13;
based groups under the care of a trained parent and affiliated with an ECD, and part-day education-&#13;
only groups in existing ECD centers and primary schools can relieve the excess demand for quality&#13;
childcare and enable mothers to return to work without sacrificing their childrenâ&#128;&#153;s development.&#13;
&#13;
A concrete measure that can support the livelihood of young parents and improve utilization&#13;
of pro-natalist policies is to relax the constraints on how maternity (family) capital is spent.&#13;
Some Russian regions are experimenting with expanding eligible spending for regional maternity&#13;
(family) capital to housing maintenance, payment of gas connection fees, purchase of a country house&#13;
plot, acquisition of durables, or even unrestricted lump-sum payments. These regional initiatives can&#13;
be evaluated in considering whether to expand eligible spending categories for the federal benefit,&#13;
which could make the program more effective in protecting Russian families in difficult times.&#13;
Examples of worthwhile eligible spending are coverage of fees for treatment of children in medical&#13;
emergencies and payment of premiums for voluntary medical insurance for children, as well as&#13;
expenses for the cost of work-related education (training, retraining, or advanced training) for young&#13;
parents.&#13;
&#13;
The effectiveness of any planned future family policies can best be enhanced by the&#13;
availability of supporting data, rigorous demographic research, and timely monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. No policy can be designed well without timely and high-quality data. Currently, many&#13;
important statisticsâ&#128;&#148;such as distribution of newborns by birth order, number of children in&#13;
divorced families, and data on parents who marry and separateâ&#128;&#148;are not collected. Promotion and&#13;
utilization of demographic research and monitoring of the effectiveness of current family policies can&#13;
generate valuable policy design lessons. The planned 2015 nationally representative household&#13;
survey is expected to provide such information. Finally, a deeper awareness and appreciation of the&#13;
current demographic situation at all levels of government can promote better policy design and more&#13;
effective implementation.&#13;

            Family policies in Russia : could efforts
            to raise fertility rates slow population aging?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Policymakers in many countries,
            including the Russian Federation, are attempting to
            encourage fertility as part of their response to the
            challenge of population aging. Whether pro-natalist policies
            will be effective depends crucially on how well they address
            the underlying causes of low fertility and barriers to
            larger family size. While in some countries in Western
            Europe postponing childbearing and increased childlessness
            seem to be driving the fertility decline, these factors do
            not appear to be as influential in Russia. Instead, the
            problem seems to be the relatively low frequency of second
            and higher-order births, which persists despite major
            changes to pro-natalist policies introduced in 2007 and the
            prevalence of the two-child ideal of family size. This study
            analyzes current and prospective fertility trends in
            contemporary Russia, with special attention to second-child
            birth dynamics and its determinants. Stable employment and
            accessibility of formal childcare options are found to be
            factors that are correlated with mothers' preferences
            for additional children and the probability that they will
            have a second child. In light of this observation and
            international experience, a menu of policies to improve
            work-family balance is suggested.
