        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            There is a common misconception that in
            a high-inflation environment, long-term investment can be
            funded by long-term loans as long as a high nominal interest
            rate is charged.  In reality, inflation-adjusted interest
            rates are not a viable solution for long-term financing
            because they do not provide investors with a realistic
            repayment schedule.  While high nominal interest rates in
            high-inflation economies do provide adequate real
            compensation to lenders and reasonable real total costs to
            borrowers, they create unacceptable cash flows.  In fact,
            high rates of inflation transform all long-term nominal
            interest loans into short-term loans, making them unsuitable
            for financing long-term investments.  Thus, high inflation
            creates major problems for long-term finance.  This Note
            discusses the impact of inflation on interest rates--real
            and nominal rates, and short-term rates.  The high effective
            nominal interest rates that result from high inflation rates
            cause long-term loans to become short-term from the
            borrower's cash flow point of view.  This Note uses two
            cases to illustrate this phenomenon.  Also, a separate box
            on the effect of compounding on interest payments, a subject
            often neglected, is included.
