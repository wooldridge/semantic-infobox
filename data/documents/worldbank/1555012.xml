DEMOGRAPHIC ASPECTS OF MIGRATION IN WEST AFRICA - VOLUME 1&#13;
This working paper brings together country-level analyses of the&#13;
demographic aspects of migration in English-speaking West Africa. They are&#13;
written by Bank staff and consultants under the overall direction of&#13;
K. C. Zachariah. Eight country studies, including 2 annexes, have been&#13;
prepared on West Africa migration and are issued in two volumes. Volume 1&#13;
(World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 414) is devoted to the English-speaking&#13;
countries:  Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Gambia.   Volume 2 (World&#13;
Bank Staff Working Paper No. 415) covers the French-speaking countries: the&#13;
Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Senegal, and Togo.&#13;
Each country analysis focuses on the volume and direction of external&#13;
and internal migration in that country and the demographic and socio-economic&#13;
characteristics of migrants and non-migrants. These data yield insights&#13;
concerning population distribution and the effects of migration on population&#13;
growth. They also provide the background data necessary for further analysis&#13;
of the economic consequences of migration in the region -- a study which is&#13;
now being initiated by West African scholars as a follow-up to these country&#13;
studies.&#13;
A complementary regional-level analysis based on the findings con-&#13;
tained in the country studies is found in Migration in West Africa: Demo-&#13;
graphic Aspects by K. C. Zachariah and Julien Conde (London:    Oxford University&#13;
Press, 1980).&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
Migration patterns across and within national boundaries affect&#13;
the distribution of resources -- especially human capital. When, as in West&#13;
Africa, millions of people are involved, the economic and social effects of&#13;
migration are significant to the development of both the countries of origin&#13;
and those of destination. Data from the 1960 and 1970 series of censuses&#13;
and surveys in West Africa indicate the magnitude of the flow. From 1965 to&#13;
1975, six countries (the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo, Liberia&#13;
and the Gambia) had a net gain of 1.3 million people from migration alone&#13;
while three countries (Upper Volta, Ghana, and Mali) experienced a net loss&#13;
of 1.2 million. About 4.4 million people migrated within their respective&#13;
countries. For both international and internal movements, the direction of&#13;
the flow -- from the interior toward the coast and from rural to urban areas&#13;
-- affects the regional development of the individual countries and con-&#13;
tributes to the problems of urban growth.&#13;
For these reasons the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic&#13;
Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreed in 1975 to sponsor a research&#13;
project to investigate regional migration patterns and trends in West Africa.&#13;
It was the first such study ever attempted regarding this area of the world&#13;
where migration is of great important to national development.&#13;
The project was originally designed as an ambitious two-part study.&#13;
The first part was to measure the demographic dimensions and characteristics&#13;
of migration, and the second part was to analyse the causes and consequences&#13;
of migration in three countries in West Africa -- namely Ghana, the Ivory&#13;
Coast, and Upper Volta. The demographic aspect was to be studied from data&#13;
existing at that time and population censuses that were soon to be available.&#13;
The analytical part was to be based on data especially collected for the&#13;
purpose through sample surveys in selected eco-regions in the three coun-&#13;
tries.l/ Plans for these sample surveys were abandoned, however, because&#13;
of disagreement on the arrangements with potential collaborating organiza-&#13;
tions in the region. The proposal to go ahead with the demographic element&#13;
of the project was approved by the World Bank's Research Committee in 1975,&#13;
and the OECD agreed to provide the services of a francophone demographer.&#13;
Within a few weeks, the study was initiated with analysis of the census data&#13;
for Ghana, but the project was prolonged for two and a half years because&#13;
the principal countries, the Ivory Coast and Upper Volta, took their first&#13;
census in 1975, and these data were not available until May 1977.&#13;
1/   An eco-region is a geographically limited area with a common system&#13;
of economic production or natural resource base, or both; that is,&#13;
sharing an economic and ecological base.&#13;

This volume includes the country reports and bibliography for the&#13;
English-speaking countries: Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Gambia.&#13;
The country studies of the French-speaking countries (the Ivory Coast, Upper&#13;
Volta, Senegal, and Togo) are found in Volume 2 (Working Paper No. 415).&#13;
Available data for Mali are analyzed in an unpublished paper by Michele&#13;
Fieloux available through the Population and Human Resources Division of the&#13;
World Bank. 1/ In addition, a regional volume based on the findings of the&#13;
nine country studies has been published by the Oxford University Press.2/&#13;
According to the United Nations' grouping of countries, West Africa&#13;
includes sixteen countries with a 1975 total population of 115 million.&#13;
The selection of the nine countries included in the research project was&#13;
based on the availability of recent reliable published or unpublished census&#13;
and survey data featuring information on migration. For some countries,&#13;
notably Mali and Senegal, the data from recent censuses are not yet available.&#13;
The most populous country in the region, Nigeria, was excluded because of the&#13;
controversy regarding its recent census data, particularly those concerning&#13;
its total population and geographic distribution. Niger, Benin, Guinea, and&#13;
Guinea Bissau are excluded mainly because of the lack of recent data and the&#13;
unavailability of scholars familiar with the migration situation in these&#13;
countries. Nevertheless, a great deal of information on emigration from&#13;
Guinea is presented.&#13;
Each of the country reports included here contains sections on&#13;
national demographic background, international migration, rural-urban and&#13;
inter-regional migration, and the socioeconomic characteristics of the&#13;
migrants in the specific country. Pagination is separate for each study&#13;
and the bibliography.&#13;
Although there is some attempt to point out how recent migratory&#13;
flows represent changes from historical trends and reflect current patterns&#13;
of economic opportunity and political stability, the purpose of this research&#13;
is not to analyze the causes and consequences of migration. Statements on&#13;
these issues are incidental to the primary concern. The individual country&#13;
studies and regional analysis do, however, provide a necessary base for&#13;
further research into the underlying reasons for migration and its social&#13;
and economic effects. It is hoped that the findings will also be an asset&#13;
to researchers and planners of economic and social policy in the countries&#13;
considered.&#13;

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS&#13;
Many people and institutions have contributed to the fulfillment&#13;
of these studies. The Liberia Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs and&#13;
the Gambia Central Statistics Division, Ministry of Economic Planning and&#13;
Industrial Development, provided us with unpublished results from their&#13;
latest censuses. In addition, E.A. Colecraft, Head of the Demographic and&#13;
Social Statistics Division, Ghana, Central Bureau of Statistics, and B.G.&#13;
Garbrah, Research Fellow of the Regional Institute of Population Studies,&#13;
Legon, gave us tabulations of data from the two most recent censuses in&#13;
Ghana. Needless to say, these studies would not have been possible without&#13;
these data and the generosity and interest of the government of the coun-&#13;
tries of West Africa.&#13;
Readers in the World Bank and other institutions shared with us&#13;
their expertise on the countries we studied, giving us their insightful&#13;
criticisms and suggestions for improvement of the manuscript. These have&#13;
minimized our errors and added a depth to our findings and conclusions that&#13;
we could not have achieved otherwise. Among the Bank staff, we would like&#13;
to thank Johan de Leede, Althea Hill, Michael Lav, David Bovet, and Dean&#13;
Jamison, in particular. R. Mansell Prothero of the University of Liverpool,&#13;
Department of Geography; K. T. de Graft-Johnson, deputy chief, Statistics&#13;
Division, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa; and N. 0. Addo&#13;
of the University of Ghana, were most kind in giving their time and knowledge&#13;
in this regard.&#13;
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),&#13;
the Government of Upper Volta, and the World Bank jointly sponsored a&#13;
seminar in Ouagadougou on the findings of our research. Its 83 participants&#13;
represented statistical offices and research institutes in the region, as&#13;
well as concerned international organizations. The criticisms and comments&#13;
of the participants provided many ideas for improving our analyses,&#13;
especially the interpretation of our findings, for which we are most&#13;
grateful.&#13;
Our warmest thanks are offered to the Government of Upper Volta&#13;
for its co-sponsorship of the migration seminar in West Africa. The many&#13;
kindnesses of the people and officials of that country shown toward the&#13;
participants were largely responsible for the success of the conference.&#13;
Florent Agueh, the World Bank resident representative in Ouagadougou, was&#13;
most generous in providing the services of his office and staff to those of&#13;
us attending as representatives of the Bank.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
International Migration&#13;
Ghana is one of the richest and most populous countries in West&#13;
Africa; and until recently, it was a country of immigration. The average&#13;
rate of population growth from 1920-60 was 2.8 percent per year, a rate that&#13;
could not have been sustained over this long a period under the prevailing&#13;
high mortality conditions of the region without significant immigration.&#13;
In the 1960 census of Ghana, 828,000 foreign nationals (about 12 percent of&#13;
the total population) were enumerated. Thirty-five percent of them (291,000)&#13;
had been born in Ghana, with over 10,000 born before 1920. Thus, substantial&#13;
numbers of foreigners (estimated at more than 70,000) were living in Ghana&#13;
even before 1920. The rate of population growth continued to be high during&#13;
1948-60, estimated at 2.7 percent per year, indicating continued net immigra-&#13;
tion to Ghana during the period.&#13;
By 1970, the number of foreign nationals had decreased to 562,000&#13;
(7 percent of the population) and the foreign nationals born in Ghana to&#13;
247,000. The number of Nigerians in Ghana declined by 71 percent, Ivorians&#13;
by 66 percent, Upper Volta nationals by 22 percent, and the Togolese nationals&#13;
by 13 percent. The intercensal rate of growth declined to 2.4 percent, some-&#13;
what below the rate of natural increase. Undoubtedly, during recent years&#13;
the migration tide has turned away from Ghana. For the first time in this&#13;
century, Ghana experienced some net emigration. A rough estimate of the net&#13;
loss is about 400,000.&#13;
The immigrants do not appear largely concentrated in any particular&#13;
area of the country. They are fairly evenly distributed between the regions&#13;
and by urban-rural locale. The region having the largest percentage of&#13;
immigrants in relation to total population in 1960 and 1970 was Accra (22&#13;
percent and 10 percent, respectively). After Accra, Eastern and Volta&#13;
regions had large percentage shares of immigrants in their populations in&#13;
1960; and Volta and Ashanti regions in 1970.&#13;
There does appear to be a selectivity of region by nationality&#13;
of the immigrants, however, which seems related to ethnic affiliations and&#13;
closeness to homeland. Similarly, there is a selectivity operating in&#13;
choice of urban or rural area by nationality of immigrant. For instance,&#13;
while 29 percent of the Ghanaian population were urban in 1970, more than&#13;
half of the Liberian, Malian, and Nigerian nationals were urban residents.&#13;
On the other hand, more than half of the Ivory Coast, Togo, and Benin&#13;
nationals were rural residents.&#13;
Important questions related to developmental policy in Ghana are (1)&#13;
what are the causes of the recent reversal of the immigration trend in Ghana?&#13;
And (2) what are the consequences?&#13;
The major causes are undoubtedly economic in nature. Until recently&#13;
Ghana was the richest country in the region, the principal producer of cocoa&#13;
- Gh.1 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Gh.2&#13;
in the world; it had the best educational system, the best medical facilities,&#13;
etc. Although Ghana still retains supremacy in some of these areas, the&#13;
economic situation has undoubtedly changed for the worse. At present, both&#13;
the Ivory Coast and Liberia have a higher per capita income. Ghana's GNP per&#13;
capita did not grow at all during 1960-73 while that of the Ivory Coast grew&#13;
by 3.1 percent per year and that of Togo, by 4.4 percent.    The Ivory Coast is&#13;
catching up with Ghana as a leading producer of cocoa. Ghana's currency is&#13;
weak and its purchasing power has decreased to a fraction of its official&#13;
exchange rate. At the same time, the currency of all its neighbouring coun-&#13;
tries is strong and freely exchangeable. The economic deterioration in Ghana&#13;
in conjunction with the relatively rapid improvement in its neighbouring&#13;
countries has been the main cause of the reversal of the migration trend. The&#13;
precipitating factor was, of course, the enforcement of the Alien Compliance&#13;
Order issued in 1969, but the factors leading to the promulgation of the order&#13;
were undoubtedly the deteriorating economic and employment situation within&#13;
the country.&#13;
In assessing the consequences of the recent emigration from Ghana,&#13;
it is useful to evaluate the characteristics of these migrants. Emigration&#13;
from Ghana during 1960-70 was almost entirely of foreign nationals returning&#13;
to their country of origin; few Ghanaian nationals emigrated in recent years.&#13;
The economic consequence of emigration thus depends very much on the migrant's&#13;
economic contributions before migration.&#13;
Most of the immigrants in Ghana were nationals of the neighbouring&#13;
countries - Togo, Upper Volta, and Nigeria in particular. Their age-sex&#13;
composition indicated that the migrants composed more than a proportional&#13;
share of the labour force. They had much less educational attainment&#13;
than the native Ghanaians; in fact, their average educational attainment&#13;
was lower than that of the rural non-migrants in Ghana. They were employed&#13;
in relatively low status occupations: as agricultural labour, particularly&#13;
on cocoa farms, in petty trading, etc. Ghana may well afford the loss of&#13;
immigrants engaged in petty trading, but the situation with respect to&#13;
agricultural labour is somewhat different. Although population density and&#13;
rural growth are quite high in Ghana, surveys conducted in recent years&#13;
indicate that the return migration of the foreign farm workers has adversely&#13;
affected cocoa production in the country. The rural Ghanaian youths would&#13;
rather try their luck in Accra or some other town than undertake the hard&#13;
work involved in cocoa farming. Agricultural production in Ghana and other&#13;
West African countries is quite sensitive to labour input during certain&#13;
critical agricultural cycles.&#13;
What is the prospect for future international migration to and&#13;
from Ghana? There is evidence that even during the past decade when&#13;
net migration was negative, substantial numbers came to Ghana. Migration&#13;
begets migration, and the presence of a large number of foreigners is one&#13;
factor which will ensure a continuation of immigration to Ghana. Secondly,&#13;
the need for foreign farm workers in Ghana has not disappeared; the local&#13;
people have not fully filled the gap left by the foreign nationals who&#13;
emigrated under the Alien Compliance Order. Thirdly, the economic conditions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Gh.3&#13;
in Upper Volta, one of the major countries sending migrants to Ghana, are&#13;
worse than those in Ghana; and alternate avenues of migration for these&#13;
individuals are meeting with increasing resistance. Thus, migration to&#13;
Ghana is likely to continue, but unlike the early decades of the country&#13;
when Ghana was consistently gaining through migration, or the most recent&#13;
decade when there was a significant net loss, future migration is likely to&#13;
have little net demographic impact on Ghana. Immigration is likely to be&#13;
cancelled by a more or less equal volume of emigration from the country.&#13;
Internal Migration&#13;
Rural-rural movers represent the largest share of lifetime internal&#13;
migrants in Ghana in 1970 (52 percent). However, in terms of net gains over&#13;
the most recent intercensal period (1960-70), internal migration in Ghana&#13;
appears to have been primarily urban in focus and directed toward large towns&#13;
like Accra. There also has been some movement toward the rural areas, in the&#13;
Brong-Ahafo and Ashanti regions in particular.&#13;
In 1960, 13 percent of the Ghanaian population were inter-regional&#13;
migrants, and in 1970, 17 percent were. The regions showing net gains due&#13;
to internal migration in 1970 were Accra (+273,000), Ashanti (+72,000), and&#13;
Brong-Ahafo (+117,000). All others showed net losses, with the largest net&#13;
outflow in 1970 from Northern region (-186,000). The largest net stream of&#13;
internal migrants ran from Eastern region to Accra (+79,000). Thus, Accra&#13;
and Ashanti regions were the major attractors of both immigrants and internal&#13;
migrants in 1970.&#13;
The urban population of Ghana increased from 525,000 to 1,551,000&#13;
between 1948 and 1960 and further to 2,472,000 in 1970. The rate of urban&#13;
growth decreased from 9 percent per year during 1948-60 to 4.7 percent during&#13;
1960-70. But such a drastic decline is not likely to continue; in fact, from&#13;
1970-80 the rate is likely to remain at least at the 1960-70 level adding&#13;
about 116,000 persons per year to the urban population.&#13;
Some of the urban growth has been due to reclassification of&#13;
localities (the number of towns increased from 98 to 135 during 1960-70).&#13;
Excluding this factor, considering the localities which were urban in 1970,&#13;
only about 30 percent of their growth was due to migration and the balance due&#13;
to natural increase. Net rural-urban migration was about 226,000 - about half&#13;
the net emigration from the country during the period. Not all regions or&#13;
size classes of towns shared the urban growth due to migration. Urban areas&#13;
in regions around Accra (Central, Eastern and Volta regions) experienced net&#13;
losses due to migration. Similarly, smaller towns lost population due to&#13;
migration. For towns with populations less than 10,000 the net loss was about&#13;
152,000. The growth of Accra was not only at the expense of rural areas but&#13;
also of smaller towns, particularly those in the adjoining regions.&#13;
Migration to the towns was not a one-way stream of traffic;&#13;
considerable numbers returned to the villages. Net migration to the&#13;
urban areas was positive at ages below 35 years (totalling 256,000). Nearly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Gh.4&#13;
70 percent of the net gain was concentrated in a 10-year age span, 15-24&#13;
years. The overall sex composition of the migrants was fairly balanced but&#13;
there was considerable difference by age group. Among those in the age&#13;
group 10-19 years, females out-numbered males by a ratio of 100:71; and in&#13;
the age group 25-44 years, males out-numbered females by a ratio of 166:100.&#13;
In the 1960s internal migrants were better educated than non-&#13;
migrants; but by 1970 the highest educational level was found among urban&#13;
non-migrants. Compared with the rural non-migrants, the rural-urban&#13;
migrants had on average 2.8 years more schooling in 1960; and compared&#13;
with the non-migrants in the urban areas, they had an additional 0.4 years&#13;
of schooling. The relative educational attainment of the internal migrants&#13;
seems to have declined during 1960-70, however. By 1970, the educational&#13;
attainment of the urban non-migrants was higher than that of the migrants.&#13;
Relatively fewer of the internal migrants were employed in agri-&#13;
culture compared with non-migrants in 1960 and 1970. The industrial groups&#13;
where inter-regional migrants had a relatively higher representation than&#13;
non-migrants were services (+13 percent), manufacturing (+4.3 percent),&#13;
and commerce (+2.5 percent). Excluding the deficit in agriculture and&#13;
the excess in services, internal migrant/non-migrant differentials were not&#13;
very great. While rural-urban migrants have tended to occupy relatively&#13;
higher status occupations than non-migrants, with the deterioration in their&#13;
relative educational attainment, more of the rural-urban migrants may be&#13;
entering relatively lower status occupations in recent years.&#13;
While rural and small town Ghanaians have been moving to Accra&#13;
and other major towns in recent years, there has been a simultaneous counter&#13;
movement toward the rural areas in some parts of the country. Three pieces of&#13;
evidence can be given to support this counter movement. Reference is already&#13;
made to the negative net rural-urban migration at ages above 35 years.&#13;
Besides Accra there was one other region, Brong-Ahafo, which experienced net&#13;
in-migration during 1960-70. This region has no major urban centre; the&#13;
largest town is Sunyani with a population of 24,000 in 1970. Thirdly, in 1970&#13;
there were 581,000 adult (15+ years) lifetime migrants in the rural areas who&#13;
were born in urban areas. The corresponding figure for 1960 was only 193,000.&#13;
Urban-rural migrants were not just persons returning after a&#13;
term of work in the urban areas. Their proportion of younger persons was&#13;
less than that of rural-urban migrants, although 90 percent of the urban-rural&#13;
migrants were under 55 years of age. The data on their educational attain-&#13;
ments in 1960 and 1970 show trend reversals. In 1960, urban-rural migrants&#13;
had a lower educational attainment than rural-urban migrants; but by 1970, the&#13;
opposite was true. Urban-rural migrants enumerated in the rural areas in 1970&#13;
had on average 5.3 years of schooling. In spite of their high average number&#13;
of years of schooling, about 15 percent of them were farmers. However, they&#13;
also included a relatively high proportion of professional, technical and&#13;
related workers, and craftsmen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Thus, recent internal migration in Ghana is characterized by&#13;
a large and increasing movement from rural areas and small towns to cities&#13;
and large towns, and reverse movement to the rural areas. The economic&#13;
consequences of each trend are different. Rural-urban migration reduces&#13;
population pressure in the rural areas. The rural growth rate is reduced&#13;
significantly, but economic problems are not solved, only transferred&#13;
to urban areas. The need for urban manpower is met adequately by urban&#13;
natural increase which, during 1970-80, is estimated at 75,000 per year. 1/&#13;
The recent trend toward migration of relatively less educated persons only&#13;
adds to the pressure on informal employment in the urban sector. On the&#13;
other hand, the employment of the urban-rural migrants as farmers, crafts-&#13;
men, and professional personnel indicates that they are serving a useful&#13;
economic service in the rural sector. At the same time the gap left by the&#13;
exodus of foreign farm workers has not been filled.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Ghana is one of the richest and most populous countries in West&#13;
Africa. Only Nigeria exceeds its population size, and only the Ivory Coast&#13;
and Liberia exceed its per capita income. Upper Volta, Ghana's northern&#13;
neighbour had a per capita income of only $70 compared with Ghana's $300 (in&#13;
1973), and Togo, its eastern neighbour has a per capita income of only $180.&#13;
Although the per capita income in the Ivory Coast is slightly higher than that&#13;
of Ghana at present, this was not the case in the past. Fifteen years ago,&#13;
the average income of a Ghanaian was 25 percent higher than that of the&#13;
average Ivorian. Ghana was indeed the "gold coast" of Western Africa and&#13;
the Mecca for young adult migrants in the region looking for employment and&#13;
cash wages.&#13;
Since the early 1900s, large numbers of migrant workers from&#13;
neighbouring countries, Togo and Upper Volta in particular, have moved&#13;
into Ghana. At the time of the 1960 census, there were over 800,000 foreign&#13;
nationals in Ghana who constituted about 12 percent of the total population.&#13;
Since then, there has been a reversal of the past migration trend. Ghana's&#13;
economy has been sluggish in recent years; its GNP per capita did not grow&#13;
at all during 1960-73, while that of its western neighbour (Ivory Coast)&#13;
increased by 3.1 percent per year; and that of its eastern neighbour&#13;
(Togo) by 4.4 percent. Among the neighbouring countries of Ghana, only&#13;
Upper Volta experienced a slower economic growth. Mostly as a result&#13;
of economic and employment problems, the government of Ghana began restrict-&#13;
ing migration into Ghana. In 1969 it issued what is generally known as&#13;
the Alien Compliance Order by which foreign nationals without valid resident&#13;
permit were required to leave the country. The result is partly reflected&#13;
in the 1970 census which enumerated only 536,000 foreign nationals in Ghana.&#13;
Ghana has had an unfavourable balance of migration with its neighbouring&#13;
countries since the end of the 1960s and possibly during the early 1970s.&#13;
One of the principal objectives here is to analyse these changing patterns&#13;
of migration between Ghana and its neighbouring countries in West Africa.&#13;
Within Ghana itself there are vast climatic and economic differ-&#13;
ences. The Accra plains in the south and the northern half of the country&#13;
are covered by savannah vegetation. Part of the Upper region belongs to the&#13;
Sudanian Zone. The southwestern part of Ghana is covered with tropical&#13;
rain forest.&#13;
Partly as a result of these climatic differences, economic condi-&#13;
tions in the various regions of the country are vastly different. For&#13;
example, the per capita gross value added to the economy in 1960 was about&#13;
176 (6G) in Accra, 68 in the Western region, and only 30 in the Northern&#13;
region. But the rates of natural increase in the population of various&#13;
regions have not been very different, with the result that the pressure of&#13;
population on local resources has been very uneven. Thus, economic opportuni-&#13;
ties in richer regions have attracted migrants from relatively poorer regions.&#13;
These movements have been partly within the same geographic region, and partly&#13;
between regions. Some were movements from one village to another or from&#13;
- Gh.6 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Gh.7 -&#13;
one town to another. Others were from villages to towns or from towns to&#13;
villages. This study will be concerned with all such internal population&#13;
movements in Ghana in recent years - their magnitude, trend, characteristics,&#13;
causes, and consequences.&#13;

II. DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUND&#13;
Ghana's demographic and socio-economic conditions are better&#13;
documented than those of the other West African countries.     It had its&#13;
first population census as early as 1891.    Although several other censuses&#13;
have been taken since then, Ghana did not have a reasonably detailed and&#13;
accurate description of its population until 1960, when the first census&#13;
under self government was taken. Its latest census was taken ten years&#13;
later in 1970.&#13;
The population of Ghana is estimated (circa 1977) to be about&#13;
10 million which is more than four times that of Togo, and more than one&#13;
and a half times that of Upper Volta or the Ivory Coast. With a land area&#13;
of 238,524 sq. kilometers, this gives a density of 42 persons per square&#13;
kilometer.&#13;
During 1960-70 Ghana's population grew at an average rate of 2.4&#13;
percent per year. The birth rate was estimated to be about 50, and the&#13;
average death rate during 1960-70 was probably around 23. Net emigration&#13;
from the country reduced a potential rate of growth (natural increase) from&#13;
about 2.7 or 2.8 percent to the observed rate of 2.4 percent.     The current&#13;
growth rate should be close to the rate of natural increase as net migration&#13;
is likely to be negligible. Between 1965 and 1977, the death rate should&#13;
have declined by 3 or 4 units. With a relatively constant birth rate, this&#13;
should result in an increase in the rate of natural increase estimated at&#13;
about 3.0 percent per year. The corresponding vital rates are a birth rate&#13;
of 49 and a death rate of 19 per 1,000 population.&#13;
While census results for earlier periods reflect a higher growth&#13;
rate than during 1960-70 (Table 1), this finding has been challenged on the&#13;
basis of enumeration errors. Some analysts believe a truer pattern of&#13;
growth would be, as follows:&#13;
Period           Annual Growth Rate&#13;
1921-30                 3.2&#13;
1931-47                 1.6&#13;
1948-60                 2.7&#13;
1961-70                 2. 6&#13;
If we estimate the average rate of growth during 1921-60, it was&#13;
about 2.8 percent per year.   This is a relatively high rate of growth for&#13;
the period, and given the high death rate that prevailed in the region during&#13;
this time, it could not have been sustained except through immigration.&#13;
The population of Ghana is unevenly distributed; the density and&#13;
rate of population growth vary greatly by geographic region (Table 2). The&#13;
country was divided into seven administrative regions in 1960 (see Map 1),&#13;
but after 1960 the Western region was split into the Western and Central&#13;
regions, and the Northern region was split into the Northern and Upper&#13;
regions. For the purposes of this study, the original seven regions of 1960&#13;
are retained.&#13;

for the years shown (except 1977). The recorded&#13;
growth rate of 4.1 percent between 1948 and 1960&#13;
is felt to be exaggerated by some experts. If&#13;
allowance is made for under-enumeration in 1948&#13;
and a slight over-enumeration in 1960 (estimated&#13;
at between 0.6 and 2.5 percent), the growth rate&#13;
is about 2.7 percent.   Again, the figure of 2.4&#13;
percent as the growth rate between 1960 and 1970&#13;
is felt to be too low.   If allowance is made for&#13;
over-enumeration in 1960 and under-enumeration&#13;
in 1970, the growth rate is at least 2.6 percent&#13;

Table 2 gives some basic population data for these regions in&#13;
1960 and 1970. The largest regions by size of population are the Western&#13;
(including Central) and the Northern (including Upper); Accra and the Brong-&#13;
Ahafo regions are the smallest. The rate of growth varies from 1.4 percent&#13;
per year in Eastern to 5.5 in Accra. Three regions, Accra, Ashanti, and&#13;
Brong-Ahafo had a higher than average growth rate, while the remainder had&#13;
lower than average growth rates. Population densities are lower in the&#13;
interior (northern) regions and higher in the coastal regions.&#13;
In 1960, there were 98 urban localities (localities with a popula-&#13;
ion of 5,000 or more) with a total population of 1,551,000. By 1970,&#13;
the number of urban localities had increased to 135 and the population to&#13;
2,472,000. These figures imply an increase in the proportion urban from 23&#13;
percent in 1960 to 29 percent in 1970. At present, Ghana is one of the most&#13;
urbanized countries in Africa. Between 1960 and 1970, the urban population&#13;
increased by 59 percent (4.7 percent per year) partly due to natural increase&#13;
(54 percent of the total gain), partly due to migration (17 percent of the&#13;
total), and partly due to reclassification of localities (29 percent of the&#13;
total growth). By contrast, the rate of growth of the rural population was&#13;
only 1.6 percent per year.&#13;
Ghana is also one of the most advanced countries in the region&#13;
from the point of view of educational attainment of its population. In 1948,&#13;
only 4 percent of the population had some schooling. By 1960, 27 percent&#13;
of the population aged 6 years and over had attended school, and the cor-&#13;
responding proportion in 1970 was 43 percent. Proportionately, more males&#13;
than females had schooling (54 percent vs. 34 percent in 1970; 37 percent&#13;
vs. 17 percent in 1960), but the improvement in female education was greater&#13;
than that of males during 1960-70. Education is more widespread in urban&#13;
areas than in rural areas (59 percent compared to 36 percent in 1970).&#13;
In 1970, 84 percent of the males and 64 percent of the females&#13;
aged 15 and over were classified as economically active. The corresponding&#13;
proportions in 1960 were 89 percent and 57 percent respectively. About&#13;
8 percent of the male labour force and 4 percent of the female labour force&#13;
in 1970 were unemployed. The corresponding proportions in 1960 were 7 percent&#13;
and 5 percent respectively. The increase in male unemployment, it may be&#13;
noted, occurred despite a decrease in the male labor force participation&#13;
rate.&#13;
Agriculture was the principal employment sector for workers both&#13;
in 1960 (62 percent) and 1970 (57 percent). Proportionately, more male&#13;
workers than female workers were in this sector. Between 1960 and 1970,&#13;
however, there was a significant shift in employment rates by sex in agri-&#13;
culture; during the period, the female agricultural labour force increased&#13;
by 26.7 percent (2.4 percent per annum) compared with an increase of only&#13;
1.5 percent among males (0.1 percent per annum). As a result, while the&#13;
female component accounted for 43.7 percent of the agricultural work force&#13;
in 1960, in 1970 the group accounted for 49.2 percent. To some extent this&#13;
shift resulted from the departure of a sizeable number of alien agricultural&#13;
laborers, who were almost exclusively male (Rourke, 1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Gh.13 -&#13;
The average contribution of agriculture to the country's GDP&#13;
during 1965-72 was 44.4 percent, while mining, manufacturing, and construc-&#13;
tion together contributed only 17.5 percent. 1/ Ghana's economic growth in&#13;
the foreseeable future therefore depends on the course of its agricultural&#13;
sector.&#13;
The growth rate of the national economy has fluctuated considerably&#13;
during the past two decades. The annual growth rate of the GDP reached a high&#13;
of 7.0 percent in the immediate post-Independence period, 1957-1961/62, and&#13;
a low of -4.3 percent in 1966. Thereafter, the rate increased considerably&#13;
after a change of government and economic policies, reaching about 5.9 percent&#13;
in 1969. The average rate of economic growth for the two decades after&#13;
Independence, 1957-1977, was 3.1 percent. During the 1960s, however, when the&#13;
present recession began, the annual growth rate of the economy was 2.5 percent,&#13;
lower than the annual rate of natural increase of the population. 2/ The&#13;
1970s started with bright prospects; however, the post-1975 period has seen a&#13;
further deterioration in the economy, with super inflationary levels reaching&#13;
over 116 percent after 1977.&#13;
Cocoa is by far the most important export commodity of Ghana, and&#13;
the national economy has been and still is considerably dependent on cocoa.&#13;
Apart from its large share of export earnings, cocoa influences government&#13;
revenues, farm incomes, employment, and the overall well-being of Ghana-s&#13;
people. However, Ghana's earnings from cocoa dwindled during the 1960s after&#13;
attaining a peak level during 1960-61. 3/ This resulted from both a decline&#13;
in cocoa cultivation (as farmers increasingly shifted to the cultivation of&#13;
other crops), a lack of new expansions, and destruction by disease and pests.&#13;
The laying-off of cocoa farm workers in this process, most of whom were&#13;
immigrants, strained the already tight employment conditions in the country,&#13;
and eventually the foreign workers began leaving the country of necessity.&#13;
One of the most serious problems facing agriculture in Ghana&#13;
is that of land tenure. With the exception of a few areas, land is every-&#13;
where owned communally, and it is extremely difficult for outsiders or even&#13;
individuals within a community to secure outright purchase of land. Even&#13;
where land is available for sale or rent, the legal acquisition of it is&#13;
usually difficult because of disputes arising from the undefined or un-&#13;
established original ownership of the land. This factor has clearly affected&#13;
population distribution and movement within the country.&#13;

As mentioned in the introduction, the regions differ considerably&#13;
in their socio-economic development. One measure of their relative economic&#13;
development is given in the value added by the various regions to the gross&#13;
national product (Table 3). According to data for 1960, Accra is the most&#13;
advanced region and Northern is the least advanced. Recent indicators&#13;
showing levels of development for the regions again confirm that the Accra&#13;
Capital District, which includes the Tema industrial area, is relatively the&#13;
most developed region of the country. Accra Capital District is followed&#13;
by Ashanti, Eastern, Volta, Western and Central, Brong-Ahafo, Northern, and,&#13;
lastly, Upper Region. Development differs from one region to another; more-&#13;
over, development is grossly uneven within regions. With the exception of&#13;
the Accra Capital District, the fortunes of the regions in terms of develop-&#13;
ment keep shifting from period to period. The more urbanized, industrialized&#13;
regions and areas with substantial commercial agriculture are more wealthy&#13;
and the people's standards of living are much higher compared with areas&#13;
having no such activities. In spite of efforts made over the years by various&#13;
governments to eliminate or minimize the unevenness of development, a few&#13;
areas continue to increase their relative share of the scarce development&#13;
resources, thus widening the gap even further between the relatively rich and&#13;
the relatively poorer areas. National social and economic policies, however,&#13;
recognize the need to bring equitable development to all regions and communi-&#13;
ties, although inadequate social, economic, and geographic resources impede&#13;
progress. In addition, administrative difficulties slow the implementation&#13;
of government policies, and political instability, evident in the frequent&#13;
changes of government, hampers progress toward achieving a stable, peaceful&#13;
atmosphere for development. All these factors have influenced population&#13;
movements in the country in recent years.&#13;

III. INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION&#13;
Until the 1960s, Ghana was a country of immigration attracting&#13;
workers mainly from its neighbouring countries. The immigrants came as&#13;
farm workers and for petty trading and diamond mining. Some stayed for&#13;
long periods, bearing children in Ghana, but others returned after varying&#13;
periods of work in Ghana. 1/ The net effect of these movements before 1960&#13;
was reflected by the presence of 828,000 persons of foreign origin (12 percent&#13;
of the total population of the country), in Ghana at the time of the 1960&#13;
census. All these persons, however, did not actually migrate to Ghana; about&#13;
291,000 (35 percent) of them were born in Ghana to parents of foreign origin,&#13;
as shown below:&#13;

10+ years                                  284,000&#13;
At the time of the 1960 census, much of the immigration was shown&#13;
to be of recent origin, with about four-fifths of all immigants who were aged&#13;
15 years or above having been in residence for less than 18 months prior to&#13;
the census. The rapid influx of migrant workers into Ghana was directly&#13;

S.H. Ominde and C.N. Ejiogu, (eds.), Population Growth and Economic&#13;
Development in Africa, New York: Heinemann with Population Council.&#13;
2/   The 1960 census of Ghana attempted to identify the non-Ghanaians&#13;
in the country by collecting information on the "country of origin"&#13;
of respondents. Country of origin was defined as the country of&#13;
birth of one's father (if that was Ghana, father's father) or, in&#13;
matrilineal societies one's mother (or mother's mother). Those who&#13;
reported this as a foreign country were considered "foreign origin".&#13;
the 1970 census used a different procedure to determine nationality&#13;
of respondents. A set of criteria was fixed for Ghanaian nationality,&#13;
and those who did not satisfy them were considered foreign nationals.&#13;
Needless to say, because of the difference in procedures, a person&#13;
described as "foreign origin" in the 1960 census would not necessarily&#13;
be a "foreign national" in the 1970 census. Comparisons between these&#13;
two population subgroups is therefore difficult. Furthermore, the 1970&#13;
census count of foreign nationals is of doubtful quality because the&#13;
Alien Compliance Order of 1969 would have encouraged some foreign&#13;
nationals to either declare themselves as Ghanaian or avoid being&#13;
enumerated.&#13;

associated with the achievement of political independence by the country.&#13;
Independence brought with it a rapid economic boom, which lasted 4-5 years,&#13;
after which internal and external factors began to affect the economic&#13;
prosperity of the nation. The country has experienced increasing economic&#13;
difficulties since then, and many observers believe the situation has achieved&#13;
almost unmanageable dimensions in recent years.&#13;
The flow of immigrants to Ghana was interrupted during the 1960s,&#13;
first by economic problems in Ghana which appeared during the first half of&#13;
the decade, accompanied by better economic opportunities in other countries&#13;
in the region (especially Nigeria and the Ivory Coast), and secondly and more&#13;
abruptly, by the enforcement of the Alien Compliance Order, issued by the&#13;
Government in November 1969. According to this order, all foreign workers&#13;
without a valid residence permit were required to obtain one, and failing,&#13;
should leave the country within a period of two weeks from the publication&#13;
date of the order. The actual number of foreign nationals who left the&#13;
country because of the order is not known, but there is enough evidence to&#13;
indicate that the number was substantial. According to the 1970 Census,&#13;
the total number of foreign nationals in Ghana decreased to 562,000 (from&#13;
828,000 in 1960), and the number of foreign-born persons to 315,000 (from&#13;
537,000 in 1960). The gross flows are not known, but a few observations&#13;
about their magnitude can be made:&#13;
1.   At least 198,000 of the foreign-born who were enumerated&#13;
in Ghana in 1960 moved out of the country between 1960&#13;
and 1970.&#13;
2.   At least 166,000 among the persons born in Ghana to foreign&#13;
nationals moved out of Ghana between 1960 and 1970.&#13;
3.   At least 13,000 foreign-born Ghanaians returned to Ghana&#13;
between 1960 and 1970.&#13;
4.   Net migration of foreign nationals 10 years of age or more&#13;
in 1970 between 1960 and 1970 was on the order of 364,000.&#13;
5.   Immigration to Ghana continued during 1960-70; at least&#13;
31,000 children under 10 years of age, and an unknown number&#13;
of adults who accompanied them, moved into Ghana during the&#13;
period.&#13;
These categories do not cover all the migration streams and,&#13;
therefore, are insufficient to arrive at an estimate of the net effect of&#13;
migration on the population growth of the country. But they seem to indicate&#13;
that the country had a negative migration balance during 1960-70 and that&#13;
almost all of this was due to the return migration of foreign nationals.&#13;
Indeed, it has been estimated that the annual flow of foreign migrants into&#13;
Ghana was at least between 25,000 and 30,000 during various periods between&#13;
1960 and 1969, before the Alien Compliance Order of 1969. By the end of&#13;
1969, probably between 1-1.2 million persons of foreign nationality resided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Gh.18 -&#13;
in Ghana. Hence the negative migration at the end of 1969 was due directly to&#13;
events only four months prior to the 1970 census, namely the Alien Compliance&#13;
Order. Ghanaians themselves were not very migratory; international migration&#13;
to and from Ghana during 1960-70 was essentially a movement of non-Ghanaians.&#13;
Period of Migration&#13;
Immigration to Ghana is not a recent phenomenon. Historically,&#13;
foreign immigration into Ghana began long before Europeans arrived to trade&#13;
with and eventually colonize the country. Migration increased slowly but&#13;
systematically after the last quarter of the 19th century, interrupted only&#13;
temporarily during the First and Second World Wars. Immigration probably&#13;
reached its peak around 1969; before then, there were no restrictions placed&#13;
on entry of foreign migrants. The Alien Compliance Order of 1969 brought&#13;
the laissez-faire attitude toward immigration to a halt. The sudden enactment&#13;
and enforcement of the order has changed substantially the part played by&#13;
immigrants in the socio-economic and demographic transition of the country&#13;
since 1970.&#13;
Three pieces of evidence can be given to show that considerable&#13;
numbers have been moving into Ghana for quite a long time; first, the dura-&#13;
tion of residence of migrants enumerated in the 1960 and 1970 censuses&#13;
(Table 4). About 129,000, or 30 percent, of the migrants enumerated in 1960&#13;
had come to the country before 1947. Making allowance for deaths and return&#13;
migration, the number who actually immigrated should be very much larger.&#13;
Indeed, various estimates have been recorded about the extent of movement&#13;
of foreign nationals into Ghana at various periods during the past. For&#13;
instance, as far back as 1905, some 3,500 labourers were entering the Gold&#13;
Coast Colony (present southern Ghana) each year for employment in the mines&#13;
or as carriers, labourers, or scavengers (Gold Coast, 1905, Colonial Report,&#13;
No. 534). Kimble (1963:43) also reports that the recruitment of labour by&#13;
the colonial government reached its peak by 1917 of 15,000 annually. French&#13;
nationals from Upper Volta, the Ivory Coast, etc., began to migrate southward&#13;
in greater numbers in the mid-1930s. Figures available for 1931-1935 show&#13;
an average of 40,000 French nationals annually coming to the southern areas&#13;
of Ghana. These statistics were computed at the Yeji ferry crossing (in&#13;
Ghana), and exclude other persons who may have come to the south by other&#13;
routes.&#13;
In addition, the 1971 Supplementary Enquiry data indicate consider-&#13;
able past movement, but a recent decline. During 1959-60, the average number&#13;
of immigrants was about 40,000, but the corresponding number during 1966-70&#13;
was only about 10,000.&#13;
A final piece of evidence indicating the historical aspects of&#13;
migration to Ghana is the presence of large numbers of older foreign nationals&#13;
born in Ghana (see Table 5). These persons are children of immigrants who&#13;
came to Ghana in the past. At least 10,000 persons who were born to foreign&#13;
nationals during 1925-29 were living in Ghana at the time of the 1960 census.&#13;
This would indicate that at least 75,000 foreign nationals were living in&#13;
&#13;

Ghana during 1925-29. Table 5 demonstrates that successive generations of&#13;
foreign nationals are composed largely of individuals born locally. During&#13;
the thirty years before 1970, 62.6 percent of foreign nationals were local&#13;
born residents; whereas, of the generation before them, only 12 percent had&#13;
been born locally, in Ghana. The 1970 situation was significantly influenced&#13;
by the Alien Compliance Order, because most of the aliens who left the country&#13;
were those born abroad. The local-born largely stayed behind; some of them&#13;
considered Ghana their home.&#13;
Origin of the Migrants&#13;
Most of the immigrants to Ghana came from neighbouring countries,&#13;
75 percent in 1970 and 65 percent in 1960 (refer to Map 2). Togo has been&#13;
and still is the principal source of immigration; its share of the total&#13;
migrants to Ghana increased from 34 to 44 percent between 1960 and 1970. 1/&#13;
The Togolese are kith and kin of Ghanaians; family members live across the&#13;
artificial borders created through colonization. Naturally, both countries&#13;
have maintained very close links and interaction socially, economically, and&#13;
even politically.&#13;
Second in importance were the Upper Volta nationals who contributed&#13;
24 percent in 1960 and 28 percent in 1970. The Nigerians were the third&#13;
largest group in 1960, 23 percent of the total; but their number decreased&#13;
to 10 percent in 1970. The distribution of foreign nationals by country&#13;
of origin is given in Table 6. These figures indicate that the number of&#13;
immigrants from West African countries decreased during 1960-70, and the&#13;
migration streams most significantly affected were those of Nigerians and the&#13;
Ivory Coast nationals. (More details about each migration stream are given&#13;
in Annex Tables 2-4. It might be argued that the Alien Compliance Order&#13;
essentially precipitated the return of nationals from the countries in ques-&#13;
tion; many of them would have left anyway even had the Order not been issued&#13;
since Ghana's economy was progressively deteriorating and would not have&#13;
provided any incentive for them to remain.)&#13;
1/   This relative increase is not due to an increase in the number of&#13;
Togo nationals in Ghana, but to a lesser decrease in their number&#13;
compared to that of nationals from some other countries. For example,&#13;
the number of Nigerian nationals decreased by 71 percent, while the&#13;
number of Togo nationals decreased by 13 percent only.&#13;

Distribution of Immigrants Within Ghana&#13;
No extreme concentration of immigrants is noticeable within Ghana;&#13;
they are fairly evenly distributed among the regions and between rural and&#13;
urban areas. Ashanti had the largest number of foreign-born both in 1960 and&#13;
1970, but in terms of the highest proportion in relation to total population&#13;
of the region, Accra was first in 1960 as well as 1970 (Table 7).&#13;
Between 1960 and 1970, the number of migrants decreased in all&#13;
regions, but the decrease was much larger in some regions than others;&#13;
this resulted in a substantial change in the pattern of distribution among&#13;
immigrants in the country. On the national level, the number of foreign-&#13;
born decreased by 41 percent, and the number of foreign nationals born in&#13;
Ghana by 15 percent. But the decrease of foreign-born was as much as 63&#13;
percent in the Northern region and 58 percent in the Eastern region. Volta,&#13;
Ashanti, Accra and Brong-Ahafo were the least affected. In fact, the number&#13;
of foreign nationals born in Volta increased by 34 percent, while that in&#13;
Ashanti by 10 percent (see Table 8). It would appear from this picture&#13;
that local-born immigrants remained behind, while those foreign-born left&#13;
in large numbers after the Alien Compliance Order.&#13;
A rough estimate of net emigration among the foreign-born from&#13;
the various regions is given in Table 9. The regions most affected by&#13;
emigration were Eastern, Northern, and Western regions. Accra, Volta,&#13;
and Brong-Ahafo had relatively few losses due to return migration of&#13;
the foreign-born. 1/&#13;
Migrants from the different countries were unevenly distributed&#13;
among the different regions. Two factors appear to influence the spatial&#13;
1/   The total emigration includes a considerable number of Ghana-born&#13;
foreign nationals also. These are not shown here.&#13;

distribution in Ghana of foreign nationals, especially those from West Africa;&#13;
these factors are geographic proximity to the home area of the migrant and&#13;
ethnic affiliation (Ghana, Census Office, 1964b, Tribes in Ghana; Addo,&#13;
1967). For example, immigrants from Togo were living predominanatly in Volta&#13;
which lies along the Togo border, and the Eastern region, and Accra Capital&#13;
District, both of which also are not far from Togo. Those from Upper Volta&#13;
were living predominantly in Ashanti, Northern, and more recently in Brong-&#13;
Ahafo regions; these are the regions closest to their own home area. Proxi-&#13;
mity facilitates easier communication with home; in a sense, proximity also&#13;
minimizes problems of adjustment for these migrants. More than half the&#13;
Nigerians were living in Accra and Eastern regions.&#13;
In 1970, the Benin nationals were the most evenly distributed&#13;
migrant group in Ghana showing little concentration in any particular region.&#13;
The Nigerians were also fairly evenly distributed in 1960, but they became&#13;
more concentrated after the exodus of a good number of them during 1960-70.&#13;
An index of uneven distribution of the different immigrant groups by region is&#13;
given in Table 10. The figures indicate the minimum percentage of immigrants&#13;
who should be redistributed so that their distribution by region resembles&#13;
that of all migrant groups. According to this, the Liberians are the most&#13;
concentrated immigrants and their principal region of residence was the&#13;
Western region. Between 1960 and 1970 there was very little change in this&#13;
index of concentration for most of the migrant groups; one noteworthy excep-&#13;
tion is the Nigerians whose index increased from 18 to 30 (becoming more&#13;
concentrated).&#13;
The immigrants have been slightly more urbanized than the natives&#13;
in the past; but between 1960 and 1970, the difference narrowed down con-&#13;
siderably. In 1960, 23 percent of the population in Ghana were urban, while&#13;
33 percent of the foreign nationals were living in urban areas. By 1970,&#13;
29 percent of the Ghana population were in urban areas, an increase of about&#13;
6 percentage points; while the proportion of immigrant population in urban&#13;
areas remained more or less the same, 35 percent. This finding suggests&#13;
that the vast majority of foreign nationals came from rural areas in their&#13;
own countries of origin. A 1963 migration survey conducted by Caldwell&#13;
showed that 69 percent of foreign migrants came from rural areas in their&#13;
countries of origin, but on reaching Ghana, 86 percent of them went first&#13;
to the towns and the remainder went to the mines, cocoa growing areas,&#13;
and other parts of the country (Caldwell, 1969). Later, new dispersions&#13;
occurred; in other words, once in the country the immigrants moved about&#13;
in search of better opportunities. Evidence of this is partly obtained from&#13;
the 1960 census where 42.6 percent of all foreigners in Ghana aged 15 or&#13;
over with previous residence in Ghana were enumerated in a region different&#13;
from the one where they were previously enumerated. A majority of this group&#13;
took residence in one of the two major cocoa growing regions (Ashanti and&#13;
Brong-Ahafo) at some time during their stay in Ghana before they moved to&#13;
another region; presumably, they had been working on cocoa farms. A rather&#13;
high proportion of aliens in the Accra Capital District resided in other areas&#13;
of Ghana before coming there. Some of these had served as laborers on farms&#13;
before moving to the city to work in similar unskilled activities. The&#13;
movement generally represents a horizontal mobility; in the process, however,&#13;
many of them better their incomes.&#13;

The different migrant groups are highly heterogeneous with respect&#13;
to their proportion living in urban areas. Among immigrants from Liberia,&#13;
Nigeria, and Niger, more than half their number live in urban areas. On the&#13;
other hand, migrants from Togo, Benin, and the Ivory Coast live mostly in&#13;
rural areas (Table 12). These patterns of concentration may reflect the&#13;
occupation of the various nationals.&#13;
Urban preference in the residential pattern of immigrants is seen&#13;
especially among certain groups: females, the young, the more educated, and&#13;
those local born (i.e., those born in Ghana), a pattern of behavior also shown&#13;
by local Ghanaians. This urban preference shown by immigrant groups may be&#13;
an indicator of rapid absorption into Ghanaian society. Further, there is&#13;
a direct relationship between the level of urbanization and the proportion&#13;
of foreign nationals resident in towns; in other words, the larger towns&#13;
and regions with high levels of urbanization have proportionately more&#13;
immigrants compared with the smaller towns and regions having relatively&#13;
low urbanization. (See Addo, 1975; Caldwell, 1967).&#13;
Immigrants of non-African origin represent a very small minority of&#13;
the total immigrant population in the country. The entire group represented&#13;
2 percent of total foreign nationals in 1960 and 2.6 percent in 1970. These&#13;
came from the United Kingdom and other European countries, such as West&#13;

decline of 30 percent. Persons from North and South American countries,&#13;
such as the United States, Canada, the West Indies, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina,&#13;
and other Caribbean areas numbered 2,366 in 1960 and 2,279 in 1970, showing&#13;
no appreciable change. Those from Asian countries -- India, China, Pakistan,&#13;
Japan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Burma -- numbered 1,191 in&#13;
1960 and 2,692 in 1970, more than doubling over the decade. A small group,&#13;
numbering 121 in 1960 and 94 in 1970, came from Australia, New Zealand, and&#13;
Oceania. In spite of the small numerical impact of non-Africans among total&#13;
foreigners, they were represented among the most highly skilled personnel in&#13;
the country. They lived mainly in urban areas, and worked as professionals,&#13;
administrators, managers, technicians, and executives.&#13;
Net Migration&#13;
A rough estimate of net immigration during 1960-70 and its dis-&#13;
tribution by age and sex is given in Table 13. The total loss during&#13;
the 10-year period was 400,000, probably a majority of this taking place&#13;
toward the end of the decade. The age structure of net migration indicates&#13;
that large numbers of immigrants came to Ghana during 1960-70, but even&#13;
larger numbers left. In spite of the Alien Compliance Order, at least 50,000&#13;
males in the age group 25-34 years and at least 162,000 females in the age&#13;
group 20-29 years came to Ghana during 1960-70. The losses due to emigra-&#13;
tion were principally that of children and youths under 20 years of age and&#13;
adults above 35 years of age. These figures, and some given earlier, clearly&#13;
indicate that the net emigration of 400,000 during 1960-70 results from very&#13;
much larger numbers in migration streams in either direction. The census&#13;
data are, however, inadequate to describe these streams more fully. Esti-&#13;
mates (Gaisie and de Graft-Johnson, 1976) indicate that the maximum number&#13;
of aliens affected by the Alien Compliance Order was 600,000 of whom 500,000&#13;
were foreign-born.&#13;
The total growth of Ghana's population during 1960-70 was 1,832,000&#13;
or 27.2 percent. Had there been no migration during the period, the growth&#13;
would have been 2,232,000 or 33 percent. Thus, emigration reduced 18&#13;
percent of the intercensal growth; that is from a potential growth rate&#13;
(rate of natural increase) of 2.9 percent per year to the actual 2.4&#13;
percent. The years 1960-70 were perhaps the first decade in recent Ghanaian&#13;
history in which the population of the country decreased due to migration.&#13;
It should, however, be noted that these migrants were mostly foreign nationals&#13;
(and their children) who came to Ghana sometime in the past. International&#13;
migration among the Ghanaians has been and still is relatively negligible in&#13;
terms of the total population of the country. With the acute recent economic&#13;
problems in the country, and the relatively much faster economic growth of&#13;
bordering countries on the east and west, the present decade might witness a&#13;
large emigration of Ghanaian nationals to neighbouring countries.&#13;

IV. INTER-REGIONAL AND INTRA-REGIONAL MIGRATION&#13;
Inter-Regional Migration&#13;
The seven geographic regions of Ghana differ considerably in&#13;
terms of total area, shape, population density, economic resources, and&#13;
growth. Naturally, they differ substantially with respect to their attrac-&#13;
tiveness to migrants. Some of them have consistently drawn migrants from&#13;
other parts of the country, while others have consistently sent out&#13;
migrants. A few of the regions have changed their status over the years&#13;
with respect to sending or receiving migrants. We begin with a description&#13;
of historical patterns.&#13;
Lifetime Migration&#13;
In 1960, about 834,000 Ghana-born persons were living in a region&#13;
different from their region of birth; that is, they migrated from their&#13;
region of birth to another region sometime during their lifetime. These&#13;
inter-regional lifetime migrants constituted about 13 percent of the total&#13;
population of the country. Although comparisons with other countries are&#13;
difficult, a 13 percent inter-regional lifetime migration rate indicates&#13;
fairly substantial population mobility.&#13;
Inter-regional population mobility increased during 1960-70. The&#13;
number of such migrants increased to 1,402,000, or by 68 percent, and their&#13;
proportion from 12 percent in 1960 to 17 percent in 1970. While in 1960&#13;
one in every 8 persons in Ghana was an inter-regional migrant, by 1970 one&#13;
in every 6 persons was such a migrant (Table 14).&#13;
The regions differ considerably with respect to their volume&#13;
of in- or out-migration, or their net balance. Three regions - Accra,&#13;
Ashanti, and Brong-Ahafo - had net gains due to migration both in 1960&#13;
and 1970 while the other regions had net losses (see the following map).&#13;
The largest gain occurred in Accra in 1970 (about 273,000), and the largest&#13;
loss in the Northern region in 1970 (about 186,000). Both in- and out-migra-&#13;
tion increased considerably in all the regions between 1960 and 1970. Regions&#13;
which had net losses in 1960 has even greater losses in 1970, and regions&#13;
which had net gains in 1960 had even greater gains in 1970. One exception is&#13;
the Ashanti region where the net gain decreased from 97,000 in 1960 to 72,000&#13;
in 1970. This region was probably a net in-migration region until 1960 but&#13;
became a net out-migration region afterwards.&#13;
In terms of population growth due to migration in the regions,&#13;
the greatest impact occurred in Accra where 45 percent of the population&#13;
were in-migrants in 1970 (Table 15). As mentioned earlier Accra had the&#13;
largest proportion of international migrants also. Volta and Northern&#13;
regions were least affected by in-migration. Out-migration was more&#13;
uniform, the highest rate was in Eastern, 23 percent, and the lowest in&#13;
Brong-Ahafo, 11 percent.&#13;

The regions of origin of inter-regional migrants to Greater&#13;
Accra are shown in Table 16. About 150,000 persons born in other regions&#13;
were living there in 1960. By 1970 their number increased to 360,000 or&#13;
an increase of 140 percent. The principal origins of these migrants were&#13;
the neighbouring regions: Eastern region, 36 percent; and Western region&#13;
(including Central), 24 percent. Between 1960-70 about 233,000 persons&#13;
born outside Accra had moved into this region. Although all the regions&#13;
contributed to the population gain in Accra during this period, about 80&#13;
percent of it was due to the nearby regions. The contributions of these&#13;
nearby regions are, however, decreasing as in-migration becomes increasingly&#13;
of a long-distance nature, namely from regions further away.&#13;
Ashanti is another region which had net gains in 1960 as well as&#13;
1970. As shown in Table 17 the largest number of migrants to Ashanti came&#13;
from the Northern region, although it had no common borders with it. Employ-&#13;
ment opportunities in Ashanti include cocoa farming and mining. A third&#13;
region of net gain was Brong-Ahafo. The principal origins of migrants to&#13;
this region were its neighbouring regions to the north (Northern region) and&#13;
south (Ashanti region). Brong-Ahafo, like Ashanti, offers the possibility of&#13;
employment on its cocoa farms. These two together contributed 70 percent of&#13;
the net gain (Table 18).&#13;
Among the regions of net out-migration, the leader was the Eastern&#13;
region which had a lifetime out-migration of 305,000 in 1970. The principal&#13;
destination of its migrants was Accra which received 129,000 or 42 percent&#13;
of the total. During 1960-70 about 155,000 persons born in this Eastern&#13;
region migrated out, 79,000 to Accra (51 percent), and 31,000 (20 percent)&#13;
to Western region. Migrations to other regions were relatively small&#13;
in number (see Table 19).&#13;
Volta and Northern were the other major regions of out-migration.&#13;
The destinations of migrants from Volta were mainly Accra and the Eastern&#13;
regions; and those from Northern region, Ashanti and Brong-Ahafo.&#13;
Migration did not always affect population growth in the various&#13;
regions. In some, in-migration was more or less equal to out-migration,&#13;
and migration contributed little to population growth. This was the case&#13;
in the Western region (see Table 20), where out-migration and in-migration&#13;
were fairly large, but the net change was negligible. An index of the&#13;
efficiency of migration for population redistribution in this region was only&#13;
0.6 in 1960 and 1.6 in 1970 (on a scale ranging from 0 to 100). (See Table&#13;
20.) In 1970 migration was most efficient in Accra (61 percent); and between&#13;
1960 and 1970, the efficiency increased substantially for Accra. The Eastern&#13;
region had a relatively poor degree of efficiency in 1960; this was partly&#13;
due to a decline in the cocoa industry following an outbreak of swollen shoot&#13;
disease which led to large-scale devastation of farms. Together with short-&#13;
ages of new cocoa farming lands, this resulted in a substantial exodus from&#13;
the region to interior areas in search of new farm land. By 1970, however,&#13;
migration had a substantial influence on population growth in the Eastern&#13;
region. The index of migration efficiency decreased considerably in Ashanti,&#13;

Brong-Ahafo, and the Northern regions. On balance there was little change&#13;
for the country as a whole. About 33 percent of inter-regional lifetime&#13;
migration resulted in population redistribution between the regions, and the&#13;
balance (67 percent) was cancelled by movements in the opposite direction.&#13;
Inter-Censal Migration&#13;
Lifetime migration is not always a good index of current migration&#13;
but such data can be used to estimate inter-censal migration. Table 21&#13;
gives the inter-censal migration computed from these data for the period&#13;
1960-70. Only two regions had net gains; Accra with a net in-migration&#13;
of 196,000 and Brong-Ahafo with 45,000. All the other regions, including&#13;
Ashanti, had net losses. The largest losses were in Volta, 89,000, and&#13;
in Eastern, 84,000. The origins of the migrants to Accra as shown in&#13;
Table 22 indicate that all the other regions contributed to the population&#13;
growth in Accra, but the gains from the neighbouring regions were much&#13;
larger than those from regions further away. On the other hand, Brong-&#13;
Ahafo had net losses to the Western region and Accra, but net gains from&#13;
the others. The principal contributor of this gain is the Northern region&#13;
which accounts for two-thirds of the total net gain (see Table 23).&#13;
The principal inter-regional migration streams between 1960-70&#13;
are shown in Table 24. The largest movement during this period was from the&#13;
Eastern region to Accra (79,000). These are, however, net movements during&#13;
the 10-year period; the total number of persons who moved between the&#13;
regions would be much larger.&#13;
Some additonal details of net gains and losses between these&#13;
regions are available in Table 25. Accra's net gain of 186,000 was more&#13;
or less equally distributed between the sexes and age groups. A different&#13;
picture emerges for the Western region where there was a small net gain of&#13;
males and a larger net loss of females. The Western region seems to have&#13;
gained some children and men in the age group 15-24 years. In the Eastern&#13;
region, which also had a net loss, the loss is evident among both sexes and&#13;
in all age groups, but particularly in the ages 15-34.&#13;
Intra-Regional Migration&#13;
Intra-regional lifetime migrants are persons enumerated in locali-&#13;
ties different from the ones in which they were born all within the confines&#13;
of a region. Over a fifth of the Ghana-born population in 1960 were&#13;
lifetime intra-regional migrants and this proportion remained practically&#13;
the same in 1970 (Tables 26 and 27). The regions vary in their proportion&#13;
of lifetime intra-regional migrants, and there appears to be a positive&#13;
relationship between the population size of a region and its proportion&#13;
of lifetime intra-regional migrants. It should be stressed, however,&#13;
that the proportion of lifetime intra-regional migrants in a region is&#13;
a function of several factors besides its population size, such as the&#13;

geographic size of the region and the number of residential localities&#13;
in it, the spatial distribution, changes in economic opportunities,&#13;
homogeneity of residents in the region and their mutual compatibility&#13;
and acceptance, etc. In Ghana, tribal homogeneity, and intertribal accep-&#13;
tance and linguistic identity are powerful determinants of both inter-&#13;
regional and intra-regional migration.&#13;
Accra region has the lowest proportion of intra-regional migrants&#13;
compared to the other regions in Ghana. This is mostly because of its small&#13;
geographical size. The highest proportion of intra-regional migrants is&#13;
observed in the Eastern region and may be attributed to the shifting of agri-&#13;
cultural areas in that region in the past. For example, people living on&#13;
the Akwapim ridge where cocoa cultivation quickly exhausted the land, and&#13;
those in the Krobo areas, spread to other parts of the region, especially&#13;
to the Akim Abuakwa area to gain more farm land.&#13;
Are people born in certain regions more prone to migrate than&#13;
those born in other regions? Or do the regions give differential stimulus&#13;
to (the native) people to migrate? The data in Table 28 show that the&#13;
regions do differ in this regard as far as internal migration is concerned;&#13;
some regions have a much higher incidence of migration than others (such as&#13;
the Eastern region compared to Brong-Ahafo region). It is interesting to&#13;
note that the proportional distribution of intra-regional migrants remained&#13;
virtually unaltered between 1960 and 1970. Eastern, Western, and Volta&#13;
regions remained in the lead, giving a stimulus to migrate both in 1960 and&#13;
1970, whereas Accra and Brong-Ahafo regions lagged behind consistently.&#13;
There was also an increase in the overall proportion of internal migrants in&#13;
the population during 1960-1970, which seemed to be indicative of an increas-&#13;
ing propensity of people in Ghana to migrate. However, there appears to be&#13;
no significant relationship between the proportion of intra-regional migrants&#13;
and the proportion of out-migrants from a region.&#13;
A somewhat detailed picture of population composition by lifetime&#13;
migration status in each region of Ghana for 1960 and 1970 is presented in&#13;
Table 29. The share of international lifetime migrants in the total&#13;
population of each region declined during 1960-70, while the shares of&#13;
intra-regional and inter-regional migrants generally increased during this&#13;
period. Population redistribution occurs continually, with persons moving&#13;
mainly to the most developed regions and areas of greatest economic activity,&#13;
such as the new forest regions. How much of the population redistribution&#13;
which occurred between 1960-70 resulted from the Alien Compliance Order is&#13;
unknown; but, it has been shown that a large number of Ghanaians took the&#13;
place of alien workers on the farms and in the towns (Addo, 1972; Adomako-&#13;
Sarfoh, 1974).&#13;

V. RURAL - URBAN MIGRATION&#13;
As mentioned in Chapter II, with about 29 percent of its popula-&#13;
tion in urban areas (localities with 5,000 or more population) in 1970 and&#13;
about 32.5 percent in 1975, Ghana is one of the most urbanized countries in&#13;
West Africa. Between 1948 and 1970, the urban population in Ghana grew very&#13;
rapidly from about 525,000 in 1948, to 1,551,000 in 1960, and 2,472,000 in&#13;
1970, a five-fold increase over a 22-year period (Table 30). Only a part of&#13;
the growth is due to migration (internal or external). The balance is due&#13;
to natural increase, and reclassification of localities. Some details of&#13;
the relative importance of these components are discussed later in this&#13;
section.&#13;
The names of towns (urban centers) in 1970 and their populations&#13;
in 1960 and 1970 are shown in Annex Table 7.&#13;
The regions differ in degree of urbanization (Table 31 and Annex&#13;
Table 8). In 1970, Accra was the most urbanized region in the country&#13;
(85 percent urban), and the Upper region was the least urbanized (7 per-&#13;
cent). These regions held the same rank in 1948, but the trend of urban&#13;
growth in other regions varied considerably. Brong-Ahafo had only a&#13;
little over 2 percent of its population in urban centers in 1948; whereas&#13;
by 1960, this proportion had risen to nearly 16 percent, and further to&#13;
22 percent by 1970. A similar growth pattern occurred in the Northern&#13;
region also. In other regions, by contrast, the growth of urbanization&#13;
seems to be tapering off lately (for example, in the Central, Eastern&#13;
and Volta regions). This has taken place despite the fact that these&#13;
regions are far from highly urbanized, like Accra, for example.&#13;
Lifetime Migrants&#13;
Lifetime immigrants have contributed in some measure to the&#13;
growth of the urban population. In 1960, roughly a third of the lifetime&#13;
immigrants were enumerated in urban areas, and by 1970 this proportion&#13;
had increased but little (Table 32). A third of the lifetime internal&#13;
migrants (intra- and inter-regional) in 1970 were also enumerated in urban&#13;
centers. Thus, there was very little diffrence between the international&#13;
migrants and internal migrants in regard to the type (rural-urban) of&#13;
place they were enumerated. Internal migrants were as prone to move to&#13;
urban areas in Ghana as international migrants. However, in terms of&#13;
the total urban population, there was a substantial decline in the pro-&#13;
portion of international migrants in the urban population between 1960 and&#13;
1970. The reason for this was either return migration of the immigrants, or&#13;
their moving into rural areas of the country, or both (see Table 33).&#13;
Among persons 15 years and above, there were about 3,481,000&#13;
inter-locality lifetime migrants in Ghana in 1970 (Table 34). Most of&#13;
these (52 percent) had moved from one village to another but about 578,000&#13;
(17 percent) had moved from a village to a town. A surprising feature of&#13;
Ghana migration is that about 581,000 persons born in a town were living in&#13;

a village in 1970. This is slightly more than the number of village-born&#13;
persons living in towns. Over the period 1960-70, all the migration streams&#13;
showed substantial increases but the highest growth rate was among urban-&#13;
rural migrants. These figures cannot be interpreted, however, to mean&#13;
that during 1960-70 urban-rural migration was larger than rural-urban&#13;
migration, and that net migration was in favor of the rural areas. As is&#13;
shown later, this was not true. Lifetime migration figures, as above,&#13;
are affected by many other factors such as the increase in number of urban&#13;
localities from 98 to 135, return migration, misreporting of place of birth,&#13;
and so on. Misreporting is a strong possibility in Ghana; rural Ghanaians&#13;
may tend to report an urban rather than a rural place of birth.&#13;
Net Rural-Urban Migration&#13;
There were 135 towns in 1970. Some of these were not towns in&#13;
1960, and therefore part of the urban growth between 1960 and 1970 was due&#13;
to reclassification of localities which were rural in 1960. For the&#13;
localities which were urban in 1970, the total growth was about 798,000.&#13;
An approximate distribution of this growth is shown below:&#13;
Total Population in 1960 of&#13;
1970 Urban areas                        1,674,000&#13;

population, 28&#13;
percent of total growth&#13;
Increase due to natural                   34 percent of 1960&#13;
increase, 1960-70                       population, 72 percent&#13;
of total growth.&#13;
Thus, the major component of urban growth in Ghana during 1960-70 was&#13;
natural increase (72 percent of the total); migration contributed less than&#13;
a third. This finding, derived from the censuses of 1960 and 1970, should&#13;
be interpreted with caution. The true relative contribution of net-migration&#13;
and natural increase to the growth of Ghanaian towns during the 1960s has&#13;
not been fully established, in part due to disturbances which occurred in&#13;
the population during the period, such as the effect of the Alien Compliance&#13;
Order. The order sent thousands of foreign migrants away, perhaps in par-&#13;
ticular those living in towns. As indicated earlier, one study showed that&#13;
86 percent of immigrants in 1963 reported migrating directly to a Ghanaian&#13;
town, a phenomenon which would add significantly to the proportion of growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Gh.62 -&#13;
in Ghanaian towns due to net migration. Alternately, the departure of those&#13;
migrants would reduce considerably the urban growth component due to net-&#13;
migration. In addition, the fact that a large number of Ghana-born immigrants&#13;
lived in towns and that many of them remained in the country after the order&#13;
would tend to raise the natural increase component of urban growth during the&#13;
period. Another factor which may affect the growth of towns is the transfer&#13;
of children between urban and rural areas and vice-versa. The net effect of&#13;
these transfers on population growth is unknown.&#13;
A regional breakdown of urban growth indicates that the urban&#13;
population in some regions had net losses due to migration. For instance,&#13;
the towns in the Western region had a net loss of about 48,000 for this&#13;
reason. Eastern and Volta regions also had net out-migration from their&#13;
urban areas. Most of the rural-urban migration was directed toward the Accra&#13;
region, which had a net gain of 200,000 as compared with a net gain of&#13;
226,000 for all urban localities combined. The urban areas of the Northern&#13;
region also gained considerably, receiving as much as 23 percent of the&#13;
total rural-urban migration.&#13;
A comparison of the net gains in urban areas of the regions&#13;
(Table 35) with net migration for the rural and urban areas combined (Table&#13;
21) indicates the extent of migration from the rural areas. For the Accra&#13;
region which is predominantly urban, there is no difference between these&#13;
two values. There are, however, considerable differences for other regions.&#13;
For example, the Northern region had a net loss of 53,000 but its urban&#13;
centers had a net gain of 52,000. Thus, the rural areas of the Northern&#13;
region had a net out-migration of at least 105,000. In the Western region,&#13;
the total loss was only 6,000, but the urban areas lost about 48,000. Thus,&#13;
the rural areas of this region should have gained some population due to&#13;
migration. The net gain of Brong-Ahafo was much larger than the gains of&#13;
its towns indicating that in this region the rural areas had net in-migration.&#13;
Net gain due to migration was directly proportional to the size&#13;
of town, as shown below:&#13;
Size and Class of Town                Net Migration, 1960-70&#13;
100,000+                                   +238,000&#13;

Total                                      +226,000&#13;
In fact, the smaller towns (population below 10,000) had a net loss of&#13;
about 152,000 which eliminated about 40 percent of their natural increase.&#13;
Cities (100,000 plus) and large towns had relatively the same degree of&#13;
net in-migration. More than half their inter-censal growth (58 percent)&#13;
was due to migration. Net migrants represented about 25 percent of their&#13;
1970 population.&#13;

Disaggregation of total net migration by age indicates that most&#13;
of the migrants are in the 15-24 age group, by as much as 68 percent of&#13;
the total (Table 36). In fact, among the higher ages (ages above 40),&#13;
the urban areas had a net loss. The total gain of 226,000 was a balance of&#13;
a net gain of 256,000 at ages below 35 years and a net loss of 30,000&#13;
at ages above 35 years.&#13;

VI. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MIGRANTS&#13;
Differences between the characteristics of migrants and non-&#13;
migrants and among different types of migrants indicate factors associated&#13;
with migration. The following analysis of the characteristics of migrants&#13;
in 1960 and 1970 is done principally to obtain some insight into the deter-&#13;
minants and consequences of migration in Ghana. (See also Caldwell, 1968&#13;
and 1969; and Addo, 1975.)&#13;
Age Composition&#13;
Ghana migrants included a relatively larger proportion of young&#13;
adults compared to non-migrants at origin and destination over the last&#13;
decade. There were, however, differences between migrant groups, but all&#13;
of them shared a characteristic bulge in the young adult ages (Table 37).&#13;
Migrants who moved into urban areas during the 1960-70 decade showed a much&#13;
greater concentration in the young adult ages (15-34 years) than those&#13;
who moved into the rural areas. In fact, almost the entire net positive&#13;
migration to urban areas shown in Table 36 was contributed by the age group&#13;
15-24 years. This was mostly due to in-migration at these young ages and&#13;
return migration at relatively older ages. The origin of migrants (rural or&#13;
urban) has been less important than the destination in determining their age&#13;
distribution (see Table 38).&#13;
In-migrants and out-migrants differed by region with respect&#13;
to the degree of age differential. In a predominantly in-migration region&#13;
such as Accra, in-migrant age distributions showed a bulge in the working&#13;
ages, but out-migrant age distributions were smoother. The opposite was true&#13;
in the Volta region, a predominantly out-migration area. In this case, the&#13;
out-migrants were concentrated in the young adult ages while the in-migrants&#13;
were more evenly distributed (see Figure 1).&#13;
The concentration of migrants, particularly those moving to&#13;
Accra and other urban centers, in young working ages indicates that many&#13;
of these migrations are due to economic factors -- to take up new jobs or&#13;
look for employment, etc.&#13;
Sex Composition&#13;
The sex ratio of migrants in Ghana varied by type over the&#13;
past decade. Immigrants were predominantly male; so were inter-regional&#13;
migrants. But short distance intra-regional migrants were predominantly&#13;
female. The national picture is shown in Table 39.&#13;
Excepting minor aberrations, possibly due to differential misstate-&#13;
ment of age, there has been a regular increase in the sex ratios of inter-&#13;
national and inter-regional migrants with advancing age. For instance,&#13;
immigrant children under 15 years have a very balanced sex composition (101)&#13;
but the proportion of males increases more or less continuously up to the ages&#13;

Source: As in Table 37.&#13;
of 40-50 and stabilizes thereafter. At older ages, there are about 3 males&#13;
for every female immigrant (see Table 40). A similar relationship may be&#13;
observed among inter-regional migrants, but not among intra-regional migrants.&#13;
Rural-rural migrants have been predominantly female, but males have&#13;
outnumbered females among rural-urban migrants, urban-urban migrants, etc.&#13;
(see Table 41). The conclusion from this, seen as well in studies elsewhere,&#13;
is that there is a tendency for long-distance migration to be selective of&#13;
males and short-distance migration to be selective of females. With intra-&#13;
regional migration, the distances covered by migrants are often short, some-&#13;
times between adjacent villages. Most female migration involves marriage,&#13;
especially in the northern part of the country. Aside from marriage, many&#13;
of the inter-community movements may result from redistribution of settle-&#13;
ments, or the breaking apart of families or village populations, which leads&#13;
to the scattering of people among other localities.&#13;
Among the immigrants, there was not a single stream where an excess&#13;
of males was not observed over the last decade (Table 42). In 1960, however,&#13;
the immigrants from Togo, Nigeria, and Benin (all the countries to the east),&#13;
had a more balanced sex composition than those from other countries. The&#13;
sex imbalance was greatest among migrants from Niger and Mali.    Between 1960&#13;
and 1970, the imbalance between the sexes became more acute for immigrants&#13;
from Togo and Nigeria, but among others the ratio became more balanced (e.g.&#13;
Upper Volta, Niger, Mali). One cannot easily provide an explanation for these&#13;
changes; however, it is possible that more females than males emigrated&#13;
from Ghana during the period; for example, wives and daughters may have&#13;
emigrated after the Order of 1969, leaving their husbands and sons to remain&#13;
temporarily to take care of whatever economic activity was being pursued.&#13;

Education&#13;
Among the West African countries, Ghana is educationally the most&#13;
advanced. It is therefore no surprise that immigrants to Ghana from West&#13;
African countries are not as well educated as the average Ghanaian. The&#13;
differentials in terms of the proportion ever attending school are shown&#13;
below:&#13;

Total Ghana Population                           27         43&#13;
The proportion ever attending school was higher among the Ghanaian&#13;
population than among the immigrants in 1960 and 1970. Moreover, the gap&#13;
between the two groups has widened in recent years.&#13;
Internal migrants present a different picture. With few excep-&#13;
tions, migrants are better educated than non-migrants. Measuring educational&#13;
attainment by number of years of schooling, migrants had on average one year&#13;
more schooling in 1960 and one and a half years more schooling in 1970 than&#13;
non-migrants. 1/&#13;
The average years of schooling attained by the adult male popu-&#13;
lation of Ghana in 1960 was about 2.32 years; but those who were enumerated&#13;
in their region of birth had only 2.28 years of schooling compared with&#13;
about 3.31 years for those who were enumerated outside their region of&#13;
birth. However, the migrant groups were not homogeneous with respect to&#13;
their educational attainment.&#13;
1/   The index is computed by assigning weights (average years of schooling)&#13;
to the various educational categories and calculating a weighted&#13;
average. The weights used were: 0 for those who never attended&#13;
school, 4 for "Primary and Arabic", 7 for "Middle, Commercial, and&#13;
Technical", and 10 for "Secondary, Teacher Training and University" in&#13;
1960. In 1970 different categories were used. The weights for these&#13;
categories were 0, 6, 9, and 12. These weights are only approximate&#13;
but small errors in the weights do not affect very much differences&#13;
between the two weighted averages. However, since the categories in&#13;
1960 and 1970 were different, comparison of the 1960 index with the&#13;
1970 index is not valid. Comparison between migrants and non-migrants&#13;
and among migrant groups for the same census year is valid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Gh.75 -&#13;
To illustrate, the external migrants born in other countries&#13;
in Africa were the least educated of all migrant groups. In fact, their&#13;
educational attainment was very much less than the non-migrants in Ghana.&#13;
However, external migrants from outside Africa had a very high educational&#13;
attainment, the difference being 6.4 years more than the non-migrant&#13;
population in the country (see Table 43).&#13;
The educational attainment of migrants from within Ghana is&#13;
affected by the place where they were born (Table 44). For example, those&#13;
born in urban areas had a higher attainment than those born in rural&#13;
areas; the difference was about 2 years more schooling for the former&#13;
in 1960 and probably more since 1970. But in each of the groups, migrants&#13;
had a higher attainment than non-migrants. The differential propensity for&#13;
the educated to migrate was greater in rural areas where the migrants&#13;
led the non-migrants by about 1. 1 years of schooling in 1960. In urban&#13;
areas, the differential was marginal, about 0.1 year, but as will be shown&#13;
below, the small difference was due to contrasts in the level of attainment&#13;
of urban migrants going to rural areas and those going to urban areas.&#13;
Further evidence of the influence of birthplace is shown in&#13;
Table 45 where migrants and non-migrants are classified by their region&#13;
of birth and educational attainment. In all regions, non-migrants had&#13;
a lower educational attainment compared to migrants who moved out of the&#13;
region. However, the magnitude of this difference varied from one region to&#13;
another, with the highest difference in Brong-Ahafo and the lowest in the&#13;
Northern region. There is no indication of any association between the&#13;
magnitude of the difference and the overall educational level of the region.&#13;
Educational attainment of migrants is affected by their place&#13;
of destination as well. Those moving to urban areas and regions with&#13;
a relatively higher proportion of non-agricultural occupations had a&#13;
higher attainment than those moving to rural areas and regions with a&#13;
higher proportion of agricultural jobs. Figures supporting such differ-&#13;
entials are shown in Table 46.&#13;
Although migrants are generally better educated than non-migrants,&#13;
the extent of difference varies considerably by destination. In 1960,&#13;
rural-urban migrants had the maximum difference with almost 3 years more&#13;
schooling compared to the non-migrant rural population. Urban-born migrants&#13;
moving to other towns or cities also showed a clear-cut difference with&#13;
about 1. 2 years more of schooling. On the other hand, urban-born migrants&#13;
moving to villages were less educated than non-migrants in towns and cities.&#13;
Thus, although migrants are generally superior in their educational attain-&#13;
ment, the pattern does not hold for all migrant sub-groups. This is an&#13;
important finding and has methodological relevance when migration rates are&#13;
subjected to correlation analysis.&#13;
Additional evidence supporting the fact that migrants are heter-&#13;
ogeneous with respect to educational attainment is given in Tables 47 and 48&#13;
where differentials are calculated for inter-regional streams. Compared&#13;

to non-migrants at the region of origin, in 4 out-migration streams the&#13;
educational attainment of migrants was less; in all the other 38 streams,&#13;
the expected higher attainment among migrants was observed. The out-migrants&#13;
from Accra to the Eastern regions, from Volta to the Eastern and Brong-Ahafo&#13;
regions, and from Brong-Ahafo to Volta had the lower attainments (Table 47).&#13;
In addition, migrants from the Northern region to all the other&#13;
6 regions had a lower educational attainment compared with non-migrants&#13;
at destination. In these cases, the differences were quite large, amounting&#13;
to 3. 4 years in Accra, 2. 7 years in the East and Ashanti, and 2. 2 years in&#13;
the case of the Western region (Table 48).&#13;
Other research has found that educational differentials are&#13;
usually larger for long distance migrants than for short distance migrants.&#13;
The Ghanaian data do not support this pattern. In Table 49, it is shown&#13;
that migrants originating in a region different from the region of enumera-&#13;
tion had a higher educational attainment than those originating in the same&#13;
region. But more detailed analysis, given in the same table,, shows that&#13;
such a pattern is due to the different mix of rural-rural, rural-urban,&#13;
urban-rural, and urban-urban migration in the 2 streams. When these 4&#13;
streams are analysed separately, in each of the streams the long distance&#13;
migrants (those born in another region), had less educational attainment.&#13;
At the same time, in each of the streams the non-migrants (at destination)&#13;
were the least educated.&#13;
Length of residence is also a differential affecting migration.&#13;
Recent migrants had, on the whole, a higher educational attainment than&#13;
those who migrated in the past; and in general, the former exhibited&#13;
larger differentials compared to non-migrants as well. However, with&#13;
respect to differentials, those of intra-regional migrants were usually&#13;
larger than those of inter-regional migrants. Among inter-regional migrants&#13;
although the index of educational attainment was low among past migrants,&#13;
they usually exhibited a higher attainment than non-migrants. It may also&#13;
be noted that the educational attainment of a few migrant sub-groups, from&#13;
rural areas, was lower than the attainment of non-migrants (see Table 50).&#13;
Economic Characteristics&#13;
Immigrants:&#13;
The economic significance of immigration can be partly understood&#13;
by analysing the economic activity of immigrants. In 1960, about 89 percent&#13;
of adult male immigrants and 40 percent of female immigrants were employed.&#13;
Compared with the native population of the country the employment ratio was&#13;
higher for male immigrants (89 percent versus 83 percent), but considerably&#13;
lower (40 percent versus 54 percent) among female immigrants. Similar&#13;
relative positions held for the unemployed: a relatively higher unemployment&#13;
rate among male immigrants (6. 4 percent versus 5.8 percent), and a relatively&#13;
lower unemployment rate among female immigrants (2. 4 percent versus 3.0&#13;
percent). Adding the employed and the unemployed, nearly every adult male&#13;

immigrant is employed or looking for a job. But among Ghanaians only 89&#13;
percent of the adult males are in the labor force. The lower activity rate&#13;
of the Ghana population is due mainly to the higher proportion of students&#13;
among the native male population and higher proportion of "homemakers" among&#13;
female immigrants.&#13;
In 1960, nearly two-thirds of the employed males in Ghana were&#13;
working in the agricultural sector, about 9 percent each in manufacturing&#13;
and services, 5 percent each in transport and construction, 6 percent&#13;
in commerce, 3 percent in mining, and one percent in utilities. The&#13;
predominant industrial sector of African immigrants also was agriculture,&#13;
in which nearly half the male immigrants were working. Next in order&#13;
of importance was commerce (15 percent), then services (10 percent),&#13;
manufacturing (8 percent), mining and construction (7 percent each),&#13;
transport (4 percent), and utilities (1 percent) (see Table 51 and Annex&#13;
Table 9). Thus, for immigrants as well as non-migrants, agriculture&#13;
was the most important industry, and utilities the least important. The&#13;
difference between the migrants and non-migrants was greatest in agriculture.&#13;
In relative terms, about 15 percent less immigrants were employed in agricul-&#13;
ture; however, the extent of difference varied considerably between regions,&#13;
with the maximum difference (25 percent) in the Western region and the&#13;
minimum in the Brong-Ahafo and Volta regions. In the last two regions more&#13;
or less the same proportion of immigrants and non-migrants were employed in&#13;
agriculture (Table 52).&#13;
In contrast to agriculture, commerce employed relatively more&#13;
of the immigrant population than of the non-migrant population. The pro-&#13;
portion of immigrants employed in commerce was more than double the pro-&#13;
portion of the general population. A somewhat similar situation held&#13;
for the mining and services industries. While only 3 percent of the&#13;
Ghanaian population was employed in mining, nearly 7 percent of immigrants&#13;
from West Africa were employed in this industry. Similarly, while 8 percent&#13;
of the local population was employed in services, nearly 10 percent of the&#13;
immigrants were so employed. The predominance of commerce and services as&#13;
migrant-employing industries is observed in all regions, but that of mining&#13;
is limited to the Western and Eastern regions.&#13;
If the agricultural sector is excluded from consideration and the&#13;
7 non-agricultural industrial sectors are compared (Annex Table 9), the&#13;
predominance of the immigrants in commerce (29 percent versus 17 percent),&#13;
and mining (14 percent versus 9 percent) becomes more apparent. On the&#13;
other hand, the excess of immigrants in the service industries disappears.&#13;
Most of the other industrial groups -- transport, manufacturing, etc. --&#13;
remain as less of migrant-employing industries.&#13;
More detailed information on economic differentials between&#13;
immigrants and the native population may be obtained by comparing ratios of&#13;
the number of immigrants to the total population in specific industries&#13;
(Annex Table 9). Considering all industries together, about 17 percent of&#13;
the employed males and 6 percent of the employed females were immigrants.&#13;

Within agriculture, about 51 percent of the immigrants were&#13;
engaged in cocoa growing, while only 41 percent of the general population&#13;
were so engaged. This shows the importance of immigrants in cocoa farming.&#13;
About 59,000 male immigrants and 7,000 female immigrants were engaged&#13;
in this important economic activity in 1960. About 75,000 immigrants&#13;
were engaged in commerce in 1960 of whom nearly 69,000 were engaged in&#13;
retail trade (61,000 in petty trading, hawking, and peddling). In the&#13;
service industries, which employ 10 percent of the immigrants, nearly 40&#13;
percent were engaged in personal services (11,000 males and 3,000 females).&#13;
The representation of immigrants in government services and community&#13;
services was relatively smaller compared with non-migrants in 1960.&#13;
Less details are now available with respect to the employment&#13;
of immigrants in 1970. Table 51 above gave the change in the number of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Gh.89 -&#13;
immigrant workers from 1960 to 1970. The total number decreased by 35&#13;
percent, but the change in some of the industrial categories was much&#13;
larger. While in all the industrial categories there was some decline&#13;
in the number of foreign workers, those industries most affected were&#13;
mining (76 percent decline), commerce (68 percent decline), and construction&#13;
(58 percent decline). The industries least affected were services, where&#13;
there was no decrease at all, manufacturing, agriculture, and transport.&#13;
The return migration from agricultural, services, transport, and manufac-&#13;
turing occupations was much less than for other industries.&#13;
Occupation&#13;
About 47 percent of the male immigrants in Ghana in 1960 were&#13;
farmers compared to 63 percent of the general population (Table 53).&#13;
Such a result should be expected given the industrial classification&#13;
scheme.  Within farming, there are sub-categories where immigrants are&#13;
relatively more numerous than non-migrants.&#13;
Nearly 38 percent of the immigrant "farmers, fishermen&#13;
were actually farm workers while the corresponding proportion among the&#13;
general population was only 11 percent. A similar situation held among&#13;
"craftsmen and production process workers, etc.,". The proportion of&#13;
"laborers not elsewhere classified" was as high as 45 percent of the&#13;
total number of "craftsmen, production process workers ..." among immi-&#13;
grants, but only 21 percent among natives. In general, immigrants occupied&#13;
low status jobs (see Table 54).&#13;
Internal Migrants:&#13;
Agriculture is also the major activity of internal migrants,&#13;
but compared with non-migrants, there are relatively fewer of them in&#13;
agriculture. Among the different types of internal migrants, the proportion&#13;
in agriculture is lower for long distance migrants than for short distance&#13;
migrants, as shown below (and in Annex Table 11):&#13;
PERCENT IN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
1960         1970&#13;
Non-migrants                              72            66&#13;

Inter-regional                            44           40&#13;
Although the proportion in agriculture has decreased between 1960 and&#13;
1970, the relative distribution of migrants and non-migrants, and between&#13;
the different migrant groups has remained unaffected.&#13;

Among non-agricultural sectors, service was the principal inter-&#13;
regional migrant employing sector in 1970, while commerce was the principal&#13;
employing sector of intra-regional migrants. Ten years earlier, both&#13;
migrant groups were principally employed in commerce. Compared with non-&#13;
migrants, the proportion of migrants in commerce was much lower both in 1960&#13;
and 1970 (Table 55).&#13;
Among females, commerce is a major sector of activity. In fact,&#13;
the proportion of inter-regional female migrants in commerce was as high as&#13;
that in agriculture; and the proportion of migrants in commerce far exceeded&#13;
non-migrants (see Annex Table 11).&#13;
The differential in industrial employment between migrants and&#13;
non-migrants is a function of the distance the migrants move. The direction&#13;
of the differential is not affected by distance, but the degree of the&#13;
differential increases with distance. Thus, the intra-regional migrants&#13;
fell inbetween the non-migrants and the inter-regional migrants, a single&#13;
exception being female migrants in commerce. Intra-regional female migrants&#13;
had the lowest proportion in commerce; both non-migrants and inter-regional&#13;
migrants had higher proportions.&#13;
As we have seen, the principal occupation of both migrants and&#13;
non-migrants in Ghana has been farming, but relatively more non-migrants&#13;
are in this occupation than migrants (Table 56). However, there is one&#13;
category of migrants, the rural-rural migrants, who had a relatively&#13;
higher proportion of workers in farming in 1960 compared with non-migrants.&#13;
Among the non-agricultural occupations, the largest differentials&#13;
were noticed among craftsmen in 1960 (see Annex Table 12). While about&#13;
12-13 percent of non-migrants and rural-rural migrants were craftsmen,&#13;
as much as 30 percent of rural-urban or urban-urban migrants were in this&#13;
occupational group. A somewhat similar differential was noticed among&#13;
sales workers, clerical workers, and service workers. The dominant factor&#13;
in determining the occupational composition of migrants is their destination,&#13;
whether it is a town or a village.&#13;
The general conclusion which emerges from the analysis of economic&#13;
characteristics of external and internal migrants in Ghana is that although&#13;
migrants are engaged to some extent in all economic activities in Ghana,&#13;
there are typical industrial sectors and occupations in which they are&#13;
relatively more concentrated. In 1960, mining and commerce were the major&#13;
industries in which immigrants had a substantial edge over natives. By&#13;
1970, the dominance in mining decreased considerably, and that in commerce&#13;
became more pronounced. At the same time, their importance in the service&#13;
sector increased. Analysis of specific industrial subgroups indicated that&#13;
the major industrial sectors in which immigrants dominate are among farm&#13;
workers in the agricultural sector and among unskilled laborers. Thus, the&#13;
immigrants who remain in Ghana are employed in relatively low status occupa-&#13;
tions compared to the native population.&#13;
A somewhat opposite picture emerges from the analysis for internal&#13;
migrants, especially inter-regional migrants, and rural-urban migrants. They&#13;
tend to occupy relatively higher status occupations compared to the non-migrants.&#13;

Note- In the 1960 census, "country of origin" was defined as the country of birth of one's father (or, if that was Ghana, father's father) or, in matrilineal&#13;
societies, mother (or mother's mother) and this information was sought to determine indirectly the nationality of respondents.      In the 1970 census&#13;
information on nationality was directly obtained and the criteria adopted were different (see Ghana, 1970 Census Vol.III, p.xvii-xviii). Thus,&#13;
che definitionsof "foreign origin" at the 1960 census and "foreign national" at the 1970 census differ.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
International Migration&#13;
Although limited data are available from which estimates of the&#13;
volume and direction of emigration and immigration may be made, it appears&#13;
that neither stream is of great magnitude in relation to the total popu-&#13;
lation. The volume of emigration each year is probably less than that of&#13;
immigration. Reference to censuses of other West African countries indi-&#13;
cates that the number of emigrants from Sierra Leone is small. Data from&#13;
the 1963 census of Sierra Leone and unpublished tabulations from the 1974&#13;
census indicate that lifetime immigrants composed 2.7 percent of the total&#13;
population in 1963 (59,482), and 2.9 percent in 1974 (79,414).&#13;
The growth rate for the national population was 1.9 percent per&#13;
annum over the intercensal years, and 2.5 percent for non-nationals. It&#13;
appears that the foreign population is growing at a faster rate than the&#13;
national population as a result of increasing immigration.&#13;
A large majority of immigrants were of African origin (87 percent&#13;
in 1963 and 85 percent in 1974), with the greatest number coming from the&#13;
neighbouring country of Guinea (about 31,000 in 1963) as a result of its&#13;
internal political problems. Liberia, also having a common border with&#13;
Sierra Leone, provided the next largest number of immigrants. Nigeria,&#13;
Ghana, and the Gambia followed, all former members of the British Commonwealth,&#13;
and sharing with Sierra Leone accomodating immigration rules and a lingua&#13;
franca.&#13;
Among non-African immigrants, the Lebanese were the most preva-&#13;
lent (3,102 in 1963), followed by United Kingdom nationals (2,360), a&#13;
reflection of economic links dating from the colonial period.&#13;
The sex ratio (males per 100 females) of immigrants was high.&#13;
Among African immigrants in 1963, it ranged from 95 for Liberians to 216&#13;
for Nigerians, averaging 170. Among non-African immigrants, it ranged&#13;
from 110 for United States nationals to 371 for Indians, averaging 153.&#13;
These high sex ratios reflect the economic nature of most immigration.&#13;
Between 1963 and 1974, the non-African immigrant population&#13;
grew at a faster rate than the African immigrant population (4.1 percent&#13;
as opposed to 2.2 percent). The major source of the increase--whether&#13;
immigration or natural increase--cannot be determined; however, border&#13;
statistics indicate that the net gain from arrivals and departures was&#13;
highest for the Lebanese. It is possible that the bulk of growth in the&#13;
non-African population is composed of Lebanese natives.&#13;

The modal age of immigrants is between 25-29, with 44 percent&#13;
of immigrants aged between 20-39 years; the sex ratio of these ages is 192,&#13;
indicative of the influx of young working males. From 1963 to 1974, the&#13;
immigrant population became relatively younger; the percentage aged 0-14&#13;
increased from 21 to 29.&#13;
Most immigrants have been attracted to the Western Area of Sierra&#13;
Leone, which contains Freetown, the capital city. In 1974, 27 percent of&#13;
African immigrants and 37 percent of non-African immigrants resided there.&#13;
The other major areas of attraction have been the diamond mining districts&#13;
of the east and south, and to a lesser extent other mining and urban centers&#13;
throughout the country. There was some variation in this general pattern of&#13;
immigrant settlement by country of origin. For instance, Ghanaians settled&#13;
near the beach fisheries, avoiding the interior; while the Lebanese and&#13;
Syrians scattered throughout the country fairly evenly, carrying their whole-&#13;
sale and retail trade businesses to areas of high consumer demand.&#13;
The African immigrants were largely uneducated, with estimates&#13;
of their illiteracy at 85 percent. Non-African immigrants showed a higher&#13;
level of school attendance, with an estimate of only 22 percent illiterate.&#13;
The educational attainment of the immigrants was reflected in their&#13;
occupational distribution: African immigrants were found mainly in diamond&#13;
mining, petty trading, and in the trades. Non-African immigrants were found&#13;
mainly in professional, technical and related fields, except for the Lebanese&#13;
and Syrians, who worked mainly in commercial enterprises.&#13;
The future of immigration to Sierra Leone is related not only to&#13;
the country's economic prospects, but also to the changing political situa-&#13;
tion in neighboring countries--the latter a possibly important factor in the&#13;
immigration of Guineans. Concerning the former, it might be noted that&#13;
diamond exports are expected to decrease in coming years; in 1974 it was&#13;
estimated that exports would dwindle from 1.4 million carats that year to&#13;
700,000 in 1980. As the diamond fields are depleted, their continued mining&#13;
will be based on world diamond prices and the return which might be expected&#13;
from mining deposits of lower grade and at a deeper level. However, Sierra&#13;
Leone has other mineral potential, some of which is being mined (as rutile&#13;
and bauxite). The country's full mineral potential has yet to be assessed.&#13;
In addition, there are rich fish resources, excellent soil and climatic&#13;
conditions for agricultural development, and a large untapped hydroelectric&#13;
potential (World Bank estimates). It is possible that Sierra Leone's future&#13;
development will continue to attract immigrants in search of economic oppor-&#13;
tunity, regardless of the presence of the "get rich quick" draw of the&#13;
diamond fields.&#13;
Internal Migration&#13;
If one assumes that the net effect of the movement of the indige-&#13;
nous population in and out of the country is negligible and that there are&#13;
no differences in vital rates between administrative districts, their growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- S.L. 3 -&#13;
rate over the intercensal period (1963-74) is the net result of internal&#13;
migration. The national growth rate was 1.9 percent per annum over the&#13;
period, thus areas with a higher growth rate would be those having net gain&#13;
due to in-migration. Two major nodes attracted internal migrants (as well as&#13;
immigrants): the diamond mining district of Kono in the Eastern Province and&#13;
the Western Area (having growth rates of 5.7 and 4.4 percent per annum, res-&#13;
pectively). All of the other 12 districts had growth rates under 1.9 percent&#13;
indicating that they may have lost population to the two major nodes. Analy-&#13;
zing data on chiefdoms of birth and enumeration in 1963, the diamond mining&#13;
districts of Kono and Kenema again emerged as major destination nodes. These&#13;
data on migration between chiefdoms also indicated the importance of short&#13;
distance moves within districts; the more economically developed chiefdoms&#13;
within districts received migrants from surrounding chiefdoms.&#13;
Data on the intercensal growth rate (1963-74) of chiefdoms&#13;
indicated that a number of them experienced population declines, which may&#13;
have been due to out-migration. Migrants may have left chiefdoms in the&#13;
Kenema and Bo districts and headed for the diamond fields. Other chiefdoms&#13;
with negative growth rates were located in the districts of Pujehun, Bonthe,&#13;
Bombali, Kambia, and Moyamba.&#13;
The Western Area--having the capital city, Freetown, and the Western&#13;
Rural Area--attracted migrants from all the other districts. A 1974 survey&#13;
indicated that only 46 percent of household heads in the Western Area had&#13;
been born there. The majority of in-migrants came from the neighboring&#13;
districts of Port Loko, Moyambi, Bombali, and Kambia. A 1975 Survey found&#13;
that over 80 percent of in-migrants to the Western Area went to the city&#13;
as opposed to the rural area surrounding it.&#13;
The population of Sierra Leone is predominantly rural with only&#13;
21 percent living in urban areas (defined as settlements with 5,000 or more&#13;
people). Most migrations have been rural-urban in type. Over the inter-&#13;
censal period (1963-74), urbanized localities having 5,000 or more population&#13;
gained in number and size, while localities having less than 5,000 population&#13;
decreased in number (from 18,544 to 2,030). Freetown alone more than doubled&#13;
in size over the period (from 128,000 to 276,000) due to a boundary change,&#13;
although its annual growth rate, standardizing for the boundary change, was a&#13;
generous 4.9 percent.&#13;
A 1975 survey in the Western Area found that 62 percent of in-mi-&#13;
grants were of rural origin. In Freetown itself, 65 percent of the migrants&#13;
were of rural origin; while the Rural Area attracted slightly more migrants&#13;
from urban than rural areas (52 percent) due to its proximity to Freetown&#13;
(67 percent of its in-migrants came from the city).&#13;
There is evidence of step-wise migration occurring in Sierra Leone&#13;
from the 1975 Western Area Survey. Most migrations to the Western Area were&#13;
of a single-stage type (80 percent). Twenty percent were dual-stage. Most&#13;
dual-stage migration resulted from people moving from Freetown to the Western&#13;
Rural Area (61 percent). However, there was evidence that the greater the&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
There are limited data available on the volume, rate, and trend&#13;
of migration in Sierra Leone. Vital events are recorded in some parts of&#13;
the country but the extent of coverage varies from place to place. While&#13;
compulsory registration is supposed to operate in the Western Area and some&#13;
specific chiefdoms in the Northern, Southern and Eastern Provinces, regis-&#13;
tration of vital events is optional in other areas of the country. Conse-&#13;
quently the birth and death statistics from these registers are not repre-&#13;
sentative of vital rates for the whole country and, as such, are of little&#13;
use in the estimation of migratory movements.&#13;
Some migration data are collected at international frontiers,&#13;
mainly as by-products of the administrative operations of frontier control.&#13;
However, in addition to the limitations of frontier control data as a source&#13;
of migration statistics, the heavy illegal traffic at the land frontiers,&#13;
especially between Sierra Leone and the Republic of Guinea, indicates that&#13;
such data cover only a small proportion of actual migratory movements.&#13;
Population census data and sample survey results remain the only&#13;
reliable sources of information on migration. The two recent censuses&#13;
conducted in Sierra Leone included questions on birth place and nationality&#13;
(namely, the 1963 and 1974 population censues). 1/ A majority of the&#13;
tables presented in this report are based on the 1963 population census&#13;
results. Although the 1974 census data are still being processed, the data&#13;
on nationality of the 1974 Sierra Leone population by age were extracted&#13;
from the unfinished tabulations through the kind permission of the Director&#13;
of the Central Statistics Office, Freetown. These data, however, are not&#13;
yet official and may be subject to future corrections. At the time of&#13;
writing, the data on birth place had not yet been processed.&#13;
Most of the demographic surveys so far undertaken in Sierra&#13;
Leone have been confined to the capital city, Freetown, and the Western&#13;
Rural Area. The only country-wide survey which included questions on&#13;
migration was the 1974 Sierra Leone Study to Determine the Needs and&#13;
Priorities of Children, Youth and Women. 2/ Reference will be made here&#13;
to the results of this survey, as well as a demographic survey which&#13;
focused on the Western Area of Sierra Leone. This latter survey was&#13;
conducted in 1975 through the joint sponsorship of the United Nations and&#13;
the Population Dynamics Programme, with the assistance of Fourah Bay College&#13;
and the Sierra Leone Central Statistics Office.&#13;
1/   Colonial censuses often gave tabulations by birthplace, but they were&#13;
of dubious quality.&#13;

II. INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION&#13;
There are no data available from censuses or registration schemes&#13;
which indicate the volume or direction of emigration from Sierra Leone. When&#13;
the results of the 1974 census become available, some trends may be determin-&#13;
able. However, looking at the results of censuses from other West African&#13;
countries, as discussed in other papers in this series, it does not appear&#13;
that a large volume of emigration is occurring, even to neighboring countries&#13;
or those having a common language; probably the outflow is less than the num-&#13;
ber of immigrants, which measured less than 3 percent of the total population&#13;
in 1974 (79,414).&#13;
Information on life-time immigration can be derived from results&#13;
of the 1963 census and unpublished data from the 1974 census, however. Table&#13;
1 shows the number of non-Sierra Leonean residents at the time of the censuses.&#13;
Foreigners or non-nationals, represented 2.7 percent of the total population&#13;
in 1963. By 1974 the percentage of non-nationals had risen slightly (by 0.2&#13;
percent) to 2.9 percent. This increase would result from 1) a net gain in&#13;
arrivals over departures from 1963 - 74, if any; and/or 2) a higher rate of&#13;
natural increase of non-nationals over nationals during the interval, if&#13;
any. The average annual rate of growth for the national population between&#13;
1963 and 1974 was 1.9 percent compared to 2.5 percent for non-nationals.&#13;
Origin of International Migrants&#13;
The distribution by nationality and sex of the Non-Sierra Leonean&#13;
population in 1963 is shown in Table 2 and Map 1. More than 87 percent of&#13;
all foreigners in Sierra Leone were of African origin, mostly from the&#13;
neighboring country Guinea. The Guineans constituted more than half of all&#13;
the non-national residents in 1963. Their preponderance in Sierra Leone&#13;
stems from the economic and political problems besetting Guinea since its&#13;

independence. Sierra Leone, having a common border with Guinea in the north-&#13;
western, northern, and northeastern parts of the country, and facing fewer&#13;
economic and political problems, offers economic opportunities to Guineans.&#13;
Other countries of origin of African migrants included Liberia&#13;
and the former British colonies of Nigeria, Ghana, and Gambia. The existence&#13;
of a "lingua franca" and accommodating immigration rules for members of the&#13;
British Commonwealth facilitated their migration. 1/&#13;
Among migrants of non-African origin, the Lebanese were the most&#13;
predominant, followed by citizens of the United Kingdom which still main-&#13;
tains a strong economic link with its former colony.&#13;
Data processed from the 1974 population census include a classi-&#13;
fication of the foreign population into two broad groups, African and non-&#13;
African foreign population. Information as to their country of origin is&#13;
not yet available. The distribution of foreign population in Sierra Leone&#13;
in 1963 and 1974 by these two broad groups is shown in Table 3.&#13;

Sources: Derived from 1963 and 1974 censues as cited in Table 1.&#13;
Although the size of the foreign population of non-African origin&#13;
was small, the implied average annual rate of growth over the period 1963-74&#13;
was almost twice as much as that of the foreign population of African origin,&#13;
as noted above. The major source of increase for the non-African foreign&#13;
population cannot be determined from the data, but Table 4 showing officially&#13;
recorded departures and arrivals in 1975 indicates that the net gain from&#13;
arrivals and departures of immigrants was highest for the Lebanese. If these&#13;
figures are representative of past trends, they suggest that the bulk of&#13;
increase in the non-African foreign population during the intercensal period&#13;
was composed of Lebanese.&#13;

However, these data do not necessarily cover all the departures and&#13;
arrivals for 1975. The degree of coverage is best for arrivals and departures&#13;
by air, and to some extent by sea. A large proportion of population movement&#13;
by land between Sierra Leone and the neighboring countries is not recorded&#13;
because some of those arriving or departing do not use the highways where&#13;
customs points are established, but rather take the bush trails where they are&#13;
not subject to any frontier control.&#13;
The data suggest that a majority of migrants to Sierra Leone are of&#13;
African origin, mainly coming from the neighboring countries of Guinea and&#13;
Liberia, and the former British colonies of West Africa. The migrants of&#13;
non-African origin constitute a small proportion of total immigrants (less&#13;
than 15 percent). Among these, the Lebanese appear to be the most predominent.&#13;
Destination of International Migrants&#13;
The proportion of non-nationals residing in various areas at the&#13;
time of the census gives an indication of the relative attractiveness of&#13;
these areas to international migrants. The percentage of total foreign&#13;
population residents in the 14 districts of the country during the 1963 and&#13;
1974 censuses is shown in Table 5.&#13;
Western Area, containing the capital city Freetown, is the most&#13;
economically developed of the 14 districts and attracted the greatest num-&#13;
ber of international migrants. While less than 12 percent of the total native&#13;
population reside in Western Area, more than 28 percent of the total foreign&#13;
population were enumerated there in the 1963 and 1974 censuses. This percen-&#13;
tage is even higher if migrants of non-African origin are included. Other&#13;
areas of attraction for migrants included the diamond mining districts of Kono&#13;
and Kenema. In Kono District, the percentage of total foreign population&#13;
increased from 9.9 percent in 1963 to 26.1 percent in 1974. A sizeable&#13;
percentage of the total foreign population were also enumerated in the&#13;
Kailahun, Bo, and Koinadugu Districts. The least attractive districts for&#13;
the foreign population appear to have been Bonthe, Tonkolili, Pujehun, and&#13;
Sherbro Urban.&#13;
The population of localities over 2,000 in the 1963 census are&#13;
classified according to nationals and non-nationals in Table 6. The per-&#13;
centage of foreign nationals is highest in localities situated in the&#13;
diamond mining districts of Kono and Kenema. These localities include&#13;
Koidu Town and Yamandu in Kono District, and Barma, Blama, Hangha, and&#13;
Boajibu in Kenema District. The capital city, Freetown, and some localities&#13;
on its periphery (Wilberforce and Goderich), also attract migrants. Wilber-&#13;
force is on a high point of the peninsula and has a pleasant environment; it&#13;
constitutes an attractive residential area for most of the diplomats and&#13;
expatriates. In the 1974 census, some of these localities on the outskirts&#13;
of Central Freetown (such as Wilberforce, Kissy, and Wellington) were no&#13;
longer regarded as separate localities but as part of the capital city,&#13;
Greater Freetown.&#13;

Tables 7 and 8 distribute the foreign population regionally, by&#13;
country of birth based on 1963 census data. While the general patterns are&#13;
similar to those described above, there are some variations by nationality.&#13;
Non-African immigrants reside largely in the metropolitan Western Area;&#13;
fully two-thirds of this portion of the foreign population live around&#13;
Greater Freetown, excluding the Lebano-Syrians. Another large proportion&#13;
of this group live as employees or dependents in the mining company com-&#13;
pounds of the East and South. The small remaining balance are scattered&#13;
throughout the country in missions, on projects as voluntary workers or&#13;
providing technical assistance aid, and as technical employees of the&#13;
Sierra Leone government. United States citizens are particularly widely&#13;
distributed. Almost four-fifths of all the non-African foreigners are in&#13;
settlements locally regarded as urban (see Mitchell, 1971, Table 8). The&#13;
non-African immigrants of Lebano-Syrian background are more evenly distri-&#13;
buted throughout the country. They show a high mobility in response to&#13;
economic forces; increasingly, they have moved their wholesale and retail&#13;
distribution businesses to mining areas where the demand for consumer goods&#13;
is high.&#13;
Immigrants of African origin are distributed mainly in the&#13;
country's areas of high economic activity: the alluvial diamond fields of&#13;
the East and South, the Western metropolitan area, and to some extent, in&#13;
other scattered mining and urban centers. This pattern has varied by&#13;
nationality; for instance, Ghanaians (now repatriated) have settled near&#13;
the beach fisheries, avoiding the interior of the country (Mitchell, 1971).&#13;
Characteristics of International Migrants&#13;
Age and Sex Distribution&#13;
Age and sex distributions of the non-national population of&#13;
Sierra Leone in 1963 are given in Table 9. The predominance of males among&#13;
immigrants is evident from an overall sex ratio of 167 males per hundred&#13;
females. The modal age of immigrants is between 25 and 29 years. The&#13;
selectivity among immigrants by age and sex is even more pronounced in the&#13;
ages 20-39, accounting for more than 44 percent of all migrants in 1963 and&#13;
having a sex ratio of 192 males per 100 females.&#13;
The distribution of non-nationals by sex and age in 1974 is shown&#13;
in Table 10. As is typical of most migrant populations, the distribution&#13;
bulges in the ages 20 - 39, indicating a predominance of young adults, espe-&#13;
cially males. However, a comparison of the age distributions for 1963 and&#13;
1974 indicates a younger immigrant population has settled in Sierra Leone over&#13;
the intercensal period. In 1963, 21 percent of all non-nationals were less&#13;
than 15 years of age; by 1974, 29 percent were less than 15 -ears of age.&#13;
The increase in non-nationals over the interval appears to have been highest&#13;
in the age groups 0 - 4, 5 - 9, and 10 - 14.&#13;

Place of birth statistics are available only from the 1963 census.&#13;
Thus, an estimation of net migration by cohorts based on comparable data&#13;
from the 1963 and 1974 censuses was not possible. However, statistics on&#13;
nationality of the population by sex and age are available from the 1963&#13;
and 1974 censuses. These data will be used to estimate net immigration by&#13;
age and sex during the intercensal period. As the interval between the two&#13;
censuses was 11.69 years, the non-national population by age and sex in 1963&#13;
was projected 1/ to December 8, 1964, in order to use 10-year survival rates.&#13;
The estimated survivors of non-nationals from 1964 and the estimated immi-&#13;
gration between 1964 and 1974 by age and sex are shown in Table 11. Foreign&#13;
nationals who immigrated to Sierra Leone between the censuses but left the&#13;
country or died before the 1974 census would be missed by this method of&#13;
estimation. Similarly, naturalization of some members of the 1964 foreign&#13;
population during the inter-censal period would tend to cause an under-&#13;
statement of intercensal immigration. Any misreporting of nationality&#13;
during the two censuses would also affect the results, but there was no&#13;
reason to suggest this occurred. Finally, the number of children born in&#13;
Sierra Leone to non-nationals during the intercensal period would tend to&#13;
inflate the estimated number of immigrants. This probably accounts for&#13;
the large number of estimated immigrants in the age group 0 - 9 (1974).&#13;
A large proportion of these children, though non-nationals, were born in&#13;
Sierra Leone during the intercensal period and did not change their usual&#13;
place of residence.&#13;
Considering these limitations and their net-effect on the results,&#13;
a total number of 32,000 immigrants (20,000 males and 12,000 females) during&#13;
the intercensal period seems plausible. This would yield an immigration of&#13;
about 2,700 per annum. A majority of these immigrants were in the 15 - 34&#13;
age group.&#13;
Occupational Distribution of International Migrants&#13;
Occupational distribution may be discussed by country of origin&#13;
of the migrants. 2/ Those migrating from Europe, North America, and China&#13;
have usually been classified as professional, technical and related workers.&#13;
They are found in the fields of engineering, teaching, and religion, and in&#13;
the physical, agricultural, and social sciences.&#13;
1/   An annual growth rate of 2.5 percent was assumed for the non-national&#13;
population. The estimated population for December 8, 1974, was distri-&#13;
buted by sex and age in the same proportion as those observed in the&#13;
April 1, 1963, census.&#13;

Migrants from Asia, the Lebanese, Syrians, and Pakistanis, have&#13;
engaged primarily in commercial activities, controlling the bulk of&#13;
wholesale and distributive trade in the country. A number of Lebanese&#13;
and Syrians are associated with diamond mining, especially in the Kono&#13;
and Kenema districts. Among the migrants from Pakistan and India, a&#13;
sizeable number can be found in the teaching and educational fields.&#13;
A majority of the migrants of African origin are found in petty&#13;
trading and alluvial diamond mining, although some are also working as&#13;
bakers, tailors (Guineans), and fishermen (Ghanians).&#13;
Some writers have suggested that the contribution of many foreign&#13;
workers to the national economy has been negative--in the sense that the&#13;
arrival of large numbers of unskilled workers results in competition with&#13;
nationals for jobs, and the relative incomes of the latter may tend to&#13;
decline as a result. In addition, some foreign workers have reaped economic&#13;
benefits illegally in the country as in the case of diamond smuggling. On&#13;
the other hand, the arrival of skilled immigrants may be an asset to the&#13;
economy, as they bring with them ideas, methods, and techniques which may&#13;
benefit the country. An example of the latter are Guinean immigrants&#13;
working as auto mechanics and dressmakers, providing skills which are&#13;
scarce among Sierra Leoneans (Makannah, 1975).&#13;
Educational Characteristics of International Migrants&#13;
A classification of non-nationals (1974 census) by age and&#13;
school attendance gives some indication of the educational level of&#13;
immigrants, at least as regards their level of literacy (Table 12). More&#13;
than 88 percent of the non-nationals of African origin in the age group&#13;
20 - 44 have never attended school. This strongly confirms the view that&#13;
a majority of the migrants of African origin are illiterate. However,&#13;
illiteracy is prevalent among the national population, as well, estimated&#13;
at 85 percent in 1970 (World Bank estimates). For other non-nationals,&#13;
the percentage of young adults who have never been to school is much less&#13;
(18.2 percent for those in the age group 20 - 29). Considering immigrants&#13;
aged 10 years and over, it would appear that the illiteracy rate is at&#13;
least as high as 85 percent for those of African origin and 22 percent for&#13;
other migrants.&#13;

III. INTERNAL MIGRATION&#13;
Limited data are available on internal movements of population&#13;
in Sierra Leone. The major sources include birth place statistics from the&#13;
1963 census, the results of a 1974 country-wide survey, and available 1974&#13;
census data on the size of certain localities. In addition, detailed data&#13;
concerning migration to the Western Area, where Freetown is located, are&#13;
available from a 1975 survey reported on more fully in Annex I.&#13;
The Major Destination Nodes&#13;
The administrative units which attract internal migrants may be&#13;
identified by the growth of the native population in various areas over&#13;
the intercensal period 1963 - 74. Table 13 gives this information, as well&#13;
as the implied average annual rate of growth. The latter for the indigenous&#13;
population as a whole was 1.94 percent per annum.&#13;
Assuming that the net effect of movement of the indigenous popu-&#13;
lation in and out of Sierra Leone was negligible and that there was no signi-&#13;
ficant variation in the vital rates between administrative districts, the&#13;
implied rates of growth in Table 13 reflect the net effect of internal move-&#13;
ment of population. Districts having an average annual rate of growth&#13;
higher than that for the total population (1.94), would be those that have&#13;
gained from internal movement of population. Two major nodes of attraction&#13;
for in-migrants are evident; i.e., the diamond mining district of Kono and&#13;
the more economically developed and urbanized region of Western Area, having&#13;
the capital city, most of the educational institutions, and large commercial&#13;
and industrial establishments. The high average annual growth rates of&#13;
5.65 and 4.36 respectively portray the relative attractiveness of these&#13;
districts to internal migrants. It would appear that the rest of the dis-&#13;
tricts lost some of their inhabitants to these two administrative districts.&#13;
Surprisingly, the other diamond mining district of Kenema did not appear to&#13;
gain much from internal movement of population.&#13;
We may also examine internal migration by movement between chief-&#13;
doms; i.e., using the chiefdom as a local territorial unit of analysis, it&#13;
may be found that certain chiefdoms within districts having low intercensal&#13;
growth rates are destination nodes. Table 14 ranks chiefdoms that had a 3&#13;
percent or more average annual rate of growth between 1963 and 1974 (foreign&#13;
and indigenous population). Of a total of 149 chiefdoms, only 15 recorded&#13;
an average annual growth rate above 3 percent. Gbense and Nimikoro Chiefdoms&#13;
in Kono District each had an average annual growth rate of more than 7 percent.&#13;
Within the diamond mining district of Kenema, which recorded a low intercensal&#13;
growth rate, Lower Bambara Chiefdom seems to have been a major node of attrac-&#13;
tion for internal migrants. Bombali Sebora Chiefdom with its headquarters,&#13;
Makeni Town, also showed a rather high population growth rate that could not&#13;
be attributed merely to natural increase. Although Bonthe District recorded a&#13;
rather low intercensal growth rate, one of its chiefdoms (Imperri), constituted&#13;
an attractive destination probably due to its bauxite and rutile deposits.&#13;

An analysis of place-of-birth data for the native population in&#13;
1963 by district also indicated the major destination nodes of internal&#13;
migrants. In Table 15, the indigenous population is classified by district&#13;
according to percentage born in the chiefdom of enumeration, percentage born&#13;
in other chiefdoms in the same district of enumeration, and percentage born&#13;
in a chiefdom outside the district of enumeration. Those districts which&#13;
attracted the highest percentage of internal migrants had the lowest per-&#13;
centage born in the chiefdom of enumeration, and the highest percentage born&#13;
outside the district of enumeration. The Western Area, and the diamond mining&#13;
districts of Kono, Kenema, and Bo again emerged as major destination nodes.&#13;
Within these districts, the major chiefdoms of attraction are listed in Table&#13;
16. The relative importance of short distance migrants in the chiefdoms is&#13;
evident from the percentage of indigenous population born in other chiefdoms of&#13;
the same district of enumeration. For instance, the Gbense, Kamara, Tankoro and&#13;
Nimikoro Chiefdoms in Kono attracted short distance migrants from other chiefdoms&#13;
in the same districts, perhaps contributing to the unskilled labor force in the&#13;
local diamond mining industry.&#13;
Origin of Internal Migrants&#13;
An analysis of intercensal growth rates (1963-74) by chiefdoms&#13;
(Table 17) indicates that a number experienced a population decline, a phenomenon&#13;
which may be due primarily to out-migration. It appears that a large proportion&#13;
of internal migrants came from chiefdoms in the Kenema and Bo Districts (which&#13;
have rather low district intercensal growth rates, as in Table 13). Some of the&#13;
out-migrants no doubt returned to their home chiefdoms, having been in-migrants&#13;
only as a result of diamond mining opportunities. Some chiefdoms in Kenema and&#13;
Bo saw a decline in such opportunities from 1963-74. In addition, these chief-&#13;
doms probably are a source of unskilled labor for the neighboring active diamond&#13;
fields of the Kono District. This finding tends to support Riddle and Harvey's&#13;
view that the districts of Bo, Kenema, and Pujehun provide a basis for step-wise&#13;
migration. 1/ Some out-migrants from the chiefdoms in Bo and Kenema eventually&#13;
move to the more attractive capital city, Freetown, in search of employment&#13;
opportunities and "bright lights," instead of settling in the district head-&#13;
quarters. Other major origins of migrants include chiefdoms in the Pujehun,&#13;
Bonthe, Bombali, Kambia, and Moyamba Districts--notably Mano Sakrim, Bendu&#13;
Cha, Safroko Limba, Manbolo and Timdel.&#13;
Pattern of Inter-District Migration Flows&#13;
Among the questions asked of sample household heads during the&#13;
Sierra Leone 1974 Country-Wide Survey was their district of origin. Table&#13;
18 gives a percentage distribution of indigenous household heads by districts&#13;
of enumeration and origin. 2/ The Western Area containing the capital city,&#13;

Freetown, attracted internal migrants from all over the country. Only 46&#13;
percent of the sample households enumerated there were born in the Western&#13;
Area. A majority of the migrants originated from Port Loko, Moyamba, Bombali,&#13;
and Kambia Districts; they are the districts closest to Freetown. The good&#13;
transport links already existing between these districts and the capital city&#13;
facilitate migration. A 1975 Multipurpose Demographic Survey of the Western&#13;
Area confirmed these findings, as shown in Map 2; and its results are pre-&#13;
sented in Annex I. (See also Campbell, 1976, and Annex Table 3a.)&#13;
Other districts which attracted in-migrants included Kono, Kenema,&#13;
and Bo Districts. The percentage of migrants was highest in Kono District,&#13;
having only 28 percent of those enumerated originating in the district. A&#13;
majority of the migrants enumerated in Kono originated from the neighboring&#13;
district, Koinadugu. The districts least attractive to internal migrants&#13;
were Koinadugu, Kambia and Bombali.&#13;
Occupation Before Migration&#13;
A percentage distribution of migrant household heads in 1974&#13;
according to occupation before migration is given in Table 19. Most of&#13;
the migrants were either farmers, traders, or unemployed before they migrated&#13;
to their current place of enumeration. The percentage of household heads who&#13;
migrated while unemployed was higher in urban areas, indicating that a major&#13;
reason for migration was the search for employment or job opportunities.&#13;
This push factor is emphasized by comparing the percentage of migrant heads&#13;
unemployed prior to migration with the percentage of the national labor force&#13;
unemployed. Although data are not available for comparable years, an approxi-&#13;
mation may be made. In 1972, 4.5 percent of the labor force were unemployed,&#13;
with unemployment increasing by 4.7 percent per year (World Bank estimates,&#13;
Table 13). By 1974, unemployment nationally would have been 4.9 percent;&#13;
however, 16.8 percent of migratory household heads reported they were&#13;
unemployed prior to their move. Migrant household heads enumerated in rural&#13;
areas were mainly farmers or traders before migration, and their major motive&#13;
for migration may have been to seek better returns in another or the same&#13;
occupation.&#13;
Table 20 distributes the national working population (that is, the&#13;
employed labor force), by major industry group for the years 1963 and 1974.&#13;
While these data are not comparable to the occupational distribution in Table&#13;
19, they do indicate that workers in certain industrial groups are more&#13;
migratory than others; for instance, while only 7.5 percent of the 1974 work&#13;
force were employed in commerce, 20.0 percent of migrant household heads were&#13;
occupied as traders before migrating. In addition, 7.9 percent of migrant&#13;
heads were civil servants (including the military and police) before migrat-&#13;
ing as compared to only 4.6 percent of the total work force engaged. Farmers&#13;
appeared less migratory than might have been expected considering the com-&#13;
parable percentage of the total work force engaged in agriculture, forestry,&#13;
hunting, and fishing (25.6 percent as opposed to 73.4 percent, respectively).&#13;
However, some of the migrant heads listed in the remaining occupational&#13;
categories may have been actually within the agricultural sector (such as&#13;
those who were unemployed prior to migration).&#13;

Rural-Urban Migration&#13;
Very little is known of rural-urban migration in Sierra Leone.&#13;
The major difficulty in analyzing rural-urban migration is that information&#13;
available on birth place in the 1963 and 1974 censuses was not given in terms&#13;
of locality. A majority of respondents merely stated their chiefdom of birth&#13;
without specifying whether it was in a rural or urban part of the chiefdom.&#13;
While the place of enumeration may be classified according to type, it is&#13;
not possible to do so for place of birth.&#13;
An indication of the volume of rural-urban migration can be derived&#13;
from the growth of certain localities between 1963 and 1974 (Table 21).&#13;
In 1963, there was only one city, the capital city, Freetown, with 50,000 or&#13;
more inhabitants. It composed only 5.9 percent of the country's total popula-&#13;
tion. By 1974, the population of Freetown had more than doubled in size, and&#13;
10 percent of the population of the country lived there. This was due to a&#13;
boundary reclassification which took place in 1973 which increased the city's&#13;
area from 12.4 km to 67 km. Standardizing the boundary at its 1974 con-&#13;
figuration, the average annual rate of growth was 4.9 percent from 1963-74.&#13;
Allowing for an average annual rate of natural increase of 2.0 percent and a&#13;
generous net increment of about 0.9 percent per annum due to international&#13;
migration, the contribution of internal migration was about 2.0 percent per&#13;
annum. There can be no doubt that rural-urban migration contributed substan-&#13;
tially to this growth.&#13;
In 1963, only 7.1 percent of the total population of Sierra Leone&#13;
were living in the two localities of 20,000 or more inhabitants. By 1974,&#13;
there were 5 such localities and they accounted for 16.5 percent of the total&#13;
population. In addition, the number of localities of less than 1,000 in-&#13;
habitants decreased considerably over the intercensal period. The available&#13;
information tends to support a view that rural-urban migration in Sierra&#13;
Leone leads to a concentration of population in a few primate cities which&#13;
rank high on the development scale. In Table 22, a list of major urban&#13;
localities with up to 5,000 inhabitants in the 1974 census is shown. The&#13;
phenomenal growth of towns situated in the mining area of Kono is indicative&#13;
of their relative attractiveness.&#13;
The 1975 Demographic Survey of the Western Area (see Annex I) found&#13;
that 79 percent of all migrations to the Western Area were single stage (that&#13;
is, from place of birth directly to place of enumeration). Of these moves,&#13;
61 percent (or 48 percent of all moves) were rural-urban in type. Of the 21&#13;
percent dual-stage moves (that is, from place of birth, to a place of previous&#13;
residence, to place of enumeration), 75 percent (or 13 percent of all moves)&#13;
terminated in an urban place.&#13;

/a Freetown's boundary was increased in 1973 to include its suburbs.&#13;
Consequently, its area grew from 12.4 to 67 square kilometers.&#13;
The population of Greater Freetown in 1974 was 276,247 and its&#13;
annual growth rate for 1963-74 was 4.9 percent (using the 1973 boundary&#13;
to derive the 1963 population). Without the boundary change, the&#13;
population would have been about 186,000 in 1974, and its average&#13;
annual growth rate over the intercensal period, 3.3 percent.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The Western Area of Sierra Leone is the new name for what was&#13;
formerly called the Colony in Sierra Leone. It is one of 13 districts in the&#13;
country and is the most heterogeneous in physical, social, and economic char-&#13;
acteristics (see Annex Maps 1 and 2). The growth of its population has been&#13;
attributed mainly to internal and international migration in the eighteenth&#13;
and nineteenth centuries. By the twentieth century, the population growth&#13;
was due mainly to internal migration.&#13;
The growth rate of the population of the Western Area is high, but&#13;
it is a reflection of the growth rate of Freetown, the former city. Many&#13;
writers such as Harvey, Forde, Swindell and Banton have attributed the rapid&#13;
growth of Freetown's population to cityward migration from the provinces and&#13;
rural areas of the Western Area. One aspect of population growth which&#13;
appears to have been overlooked by these writers is the contribution of&#13;
natural increase.&#13;
This study will review the availability of data on migration in the&#13;
Western Area and discuss the findings of a multi-purpose demographic survey&#13;
conducted in 1975 in the Western Area sponsored by the United Nations and&#13;
the Population Dynamics Programme; Fourah Bay College and the Sierra Leone&#13;
Central Statistics Office cooperated through provision of supervision, enumera-&#13;
tors, and logistic support.&#13;
The survey featured a de jure questionnaire, and defined "usual&#13;
member" of the household as one who had lived, eaten, and slept there for at&#13;
least three months. The sampling frame was estimated by projecting the 1963&#13;
census population of the area. The Western Area was then divided into two&#13;
civil divisions. These are Greater Freetown, the urban division; and the&#13;
Western Rural Area, the rural division. The sample involved a two-stage&#13;
stratified selection of census enumeration areas.&#13;
Availability of Demographic Data&#13;
Between 1802 and 1971 a number of "censuses" (which were more of&#13;
counts) were conducted in the Western Area (then the Colony). The primary&#13;
aim of the counts was to check on the size of the settler population due&#13;
to the constant threats of slavery and the slave trade. These counts were&#13;
undertaken annually because there were reports that the indigenous Sierra&#13;
Leoneans were indulging in the slave trade after its abolition by the British&#13;
Parliament. These counts do not provide reliable information because the&#13;
area of "enumeration" in the Western Area was not constant. However, between&#13;
1871 and 1931 a complete census of the Western Area was undertaken decennially.&#13;
Questions on birthplace were included in the censuses of 1911, 1921 and 1931.&#13;
Though these censuses were far from perfect, the results are reliable enough&#13;
to be used. Annex Table 1 shows the growth of population in the Western Area&#13;
and Freetown based on census data.&#13;

Only 2 national censuses have been conducted in Sierra Leone; the&#13;
first in 1963 and the second in 1974. The questionnaires included questions&#13;
on place of birth.&#13;
Although the registration of vital events has been made compulsory&#13;
in the Western Area since 1801, there is no evidence that registration of&#13;
internal migration has ever been effected.&#13;
Prior to the sample survey used as the primary source of data in&#13;
this study, a few surveys had been conducted in Sierra Leone which considered&#13;
migration. Banton (1957) took some samples in the provinces and in Freetown&#13;
to find out the patterns, causes, and effects of cityward migration in the&#13;
1950s. In recent years, Devis, Singh, and the Central Statistics Office&#13;
(C.S.O.) have carried out multi-purpose sample surveys in which questions on&#13;
internal migration and urbanization were included. However, none of the&#13;
reports from these surveys include information on migration. The senior&#13;
officers of the C.S.O. frankly revealed that the quality of data on migration&#13;
was poor, and therefore not worth publishing. At present a survey on migra-&#13;
tion in the whole of Sierra Leone is being conducted by Byerlee and Tommy&#13;
with financial support from the Population Council. In the light of these&#13;
limitations on available data, almost all the literature on migration in the&#13;
Western Area has been primarily based on the population census of 1963.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. HISTORICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND TRENDS IN URBAN GROWTH&#13;
The process of urbanization in the Western Area started in the 15th&#13;
Century when Freetown was discovered by a Portuguese named Pedro da Cintra.&#13;
Because Sierra Leone has a natural harbor, Freetown became a regular port of&#13;
call for European traders. This was the start of a monetary economy in Free-&#13;
town; and because this was the only means of obtaining the "finer produces"&#13;
of Europe (such as clothes) commercial activities grew, and Freetown became&#13;
the main trading center in Sierra Leone. This attracted people from the&#13;
hinterland of the Western Area, and soon from the provinces, to the area&#13;
around King Jimmy--the oldest port in Freetown.&#13;
The settlement of freed slaves from London in Freetown started in&#13;
1737. After the trade in African slaves was made illegal by the Slave Trade&#13;
Act of 1807, slave ships were caught at sea and brought to Freetown. The&#13;
offenders were prosecuted, and the captives were released and allowed to&#13;
settle in Freetown. These were called the Liberated Africans; and their&#13;
descendants became known as the Creoles. Resettlement of freed slaves from&#13;
North America and the Caribbean also occurred. In addition, the discharged&#13;
men and families of the second and fourth West Indian Regiments and the dis-&#13;
banded Royal African Corps which served Britain in the American War of 1812&#13;
were resettled in Freetown. As the town became overcrowded, new settle-&#13;
ments grew up outside Freetown. The social and economic activities which&#13;
accompanied these settlements in the 18th and 19th centuries contributed&#13;
remarkably to the attraction of provincial-based peoples to Freetown. Con-&#13;
sequently, by 1891 the population of Freetown had grown to 30,033 persons.&#13;
Freetown was already occupied by the time it was founded and&#13;
settled by immigrants. It is claimed that the Kroos had settled in Freetown&#13;
long before the abolition of the slave trade. The Kroos are of Liberian&#13;
origin, and they form a significant ethnic group in Freetown presently.&#13;
Moreover, the Western Area was a Temne territory, and the land that was&#13;
bought for resettlements was purchased from the Temnes. Thus, most of the&#13;
early in-migrants to Freetown were Temnes and immigrants.&#13;
In the second half of the 19th century a few incidents promoted&#13;
migration to Freetown. These included:&#13;
(1) Improvement in road communication by the construction of&#13;
hammock roads in 1862. This made it more convenient for&#13;
people to travel on foot from the surrounding settlements&#13;
to Preetown to trade. The elite could afford to travel&#13;
in hammocks, rickshaw, or on horseback.&#13;
(2)  Construction of the railway from Freetown to Songo in&#13;
1899, which was later extended to the provinces. Traders&#13;
found it possible to transport more wares to Freetown to&#13;
sell. On returning home, they took back stories of the&#13;
beauty of Freetown.&#13;
- S.L. 51 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- S.L. 52 -&#13;
(3) Intertribal wars in the provinces, dominated by Bai Burch&#13;
and his tribal warriers of the Northern Province. These&#13;
wars are known otherwise as the "Hut Tax War" because they&#13;
started as a revolt against the payment of taxes on huts&#13;
in Sierra Leone. They started in the form of riots in the&#13;
1880s, with the colonialists the target of the antagonism.&#13;
As some of the weaker ethnic groups accepted the tax sys-&#13;
tem, they became the enemies of the strong groups. In&#13;
order to save themselves from death, many provincial resi-&#13;
dents migrated to Freetown and its suburbs (between Freetown&#13;
and Wellington) for protection. This forced migration went&#13;
on between 1891 and 1896 when the war ended.&#13;
After the-colonization of the Western Area by the British in 1808,&#13;
Freetown became the administrative center for the whole country. This was&#13;
accompanied by social, economic, and cultural development in Freetown.&#13;
In the 20th century, during the two World Wars, many young men&#13;
migrated to Freetown in search of employment. When the diamond and iron ore&#13;
mines in Kono and Port Loko Districts were opened up, one would have expected&#13;
the flow of migrants to Freetown to decrease; but migrants continued to come&#13;
in large numbers mainly for educational and psycho-social reasons. The&#13;
recent development of import-substituting industries in Freetown, Kissy, and&#13;
Wellington has contributed to the large influx of migrants.&#13;
Kuczynski's report on censuses and other activities in the Western&#13;
Area reveals that as far back as 1827 some consideration had been given to&#13;
cityward migration from the provinces (Kuczynski, 1948). Furthermore the&#13;
questionnaire for the census of the Western Area in 1931 queried the birth-&#13;
place of all residents. The results indicated a high in-migration rate of&#13;
Temnes, mainly for trading purposes. Most of the migrants to the Western&#13;
Area were more attracted to Freetown.   During Banton's enumeration of some&#13;
areas of the Northern Provinces of Sierra Leone, he found that over 50&#13;
percent proceeded to Freetown while the rest stopped in what was then the&#13;
"hinterland of the colony" (Banton, 1957). It is also reported that up to&#13;
1955, 60 percent of migrants to Freetown were from the Northern Province.&#13;
It is interesting to note that during this time the indigenous peoples 1/ of&#13;
the country formed 61 percent of Freetown's population (Harvey, 1968).&#13;
Forde records that the proportion of internal migrants in Freetown&#13;
in 1963 was over 42 percent. The proportion in the Western Area the same&#13;
year was 42.3 percent (Forde, 1975).&#13;
The importance of education in migration to Freetown has been best&#13;
treated by Swindell. He found that 32 percent of all boys enrolled into the&#13;
first forms of boys' and mixed secondary schools in Freetown were from the&#13;
1/   These are the non-Creoles, but Sierra Leoneans, whom historians have&#13;
referred to by various terms such as "natives" or "tribal peoples".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- S.L. 53 -&#13;
provinces (Swindell, 1970). Apart from the economic and educational activi-&#13;
ties, people were also attracted by the "bright lights" of Freetown. Banton&#13;
found that people of the provinces were fascinated by stories of tall build-&#13;
ings, automobiles, and quick-money making jobs in Freetown. School children&#13;
were informed about double-decker buses, electricity, the cinema and dance&#13;
halls. Return migrants kept themselves clean, wore city clothes, and brought&#13;
back small presents for girls (Banton, 1957).&#13;
One of the notable findings in Sierra Leone is related to distance.&#13;
Harvey found that the average number of migrants per chiefdom decreased with&#13;
increasing distance from Freetown. It is reported that 46.9 percent of all&#13;
migrants to Freetown at the time of the 1963 census originated from within a&#13;
96 kilometer radius, and 74.4 percent from within a 144 kilometer radius of&#13;
Freetown (Harvey, 1968). It was also found that the peak ages of migration&#13;
to Freetown were 20-29 (Forde and Harvey, 1969).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. VOLUME AND PATTERN OF LIFETIME MIGRATION&#13;
The 1975 survey questioned places of birth and previous residence.&#13;
The findings indicated there were 7,153 migrants (or 37.9 percent) out of a&#13;
sample of 18,896 enumerated in the city. There were 1,436 migrants (or 42.9&#13;
percent) out of a sample total of 3,335 enumerated in the Western Rural Area.&#13;
Annex Tables 2a and 2b give migration by sex derived from birthplace and&#13;
previous residence data. From the birthplace data, it is observed that&#13;
migrants contributed 8,254 persons (or 37.1 percent) to the sample total&#13;
of 22,231 persons enumerated in the Western Area. With regard to the pro-&#13;
portion of migrants in the Western Area, the results show that there is&#13;
little difference between the two sources of data. Here we will focus on&#13;
the place of previous residence data.&#13;
Annex Table 2b shows that the proportion of migrants in the Western&#13;
Rural Area is higher than in the city. In the former it is 44.7 percent for&#13;
males and 41.4 percent for females. But in the latter it is 39.8 percent for&#13;
males and 36.0 percent for females. In absolute terms, the volume of migra-&#13;
tion to the city is higher than it is to the Western Rural Area.&#13;
The city attracts most of the migrants who move to the Western&#13;
Area from the provinces. Out of 7,494 migrants who reportedly came from&#13;
the provinces to the Western Area, 88.8 percent went to the city. This is&#13;
reflected in the high migration rate of 37.9 percent in the city. This&#13;
rate, however, falls short of the rate of 42.0 percent that was observed&#13;
for Freetown in 1963. It is plausible that the rate which was observed for&#13;
Freetown in 1963 was a result of the areal size of the old city. Many of&#13;
those who were classified as migrants in Freetown originated from the sub-&#13;
urban areas which have since been reclassified as part of Greater Freetown.&#13;
Annex Table 3a gives data concerning the various streams of migra-&#13;
tion to the Western Area from the provinces (this is graphically portrayed&#13;
in Map 2 of the Okoye, "Migration in Sierra Leone," country study). Port&#13;
Loko district sent the highest proportion of migrants to the Western Area.&#13;
Pujehan district sent the least. In Annex Map 3, pie diagrams are used to&#13;
express the volume of migration to the city and the Western Rural Area by&#13;
sex.&#13;
No district sent less than 80 percent of its migrants to the city&#13;
(see Annex Table 3b). For instance, Port Loko district sent 80.1 percent of&#13;
its migrants to the city, while Pujehun district sent 97.4 percent of its&#13;
migrants to the city.&#13;
In order to identify districts with relatively high or low pro-&#13;
pensities to send migrants to the city, the mean (X) of the percentages of&#13;
migrants from the provinces to the city was used as an average for comparison.&#13;
Where X &gt; X, the district had a high propensity to send migrants to the&#13;

city. X was calculated to be 89.8 percent. Therefore, eight districts were&#13;
observed to have a high propensity to send Western Area-bound migrants to&#13;
the city; while migrants from Port Loko, Tonkolili, Koinadugu and Moyamba&#13;
had a lower tendency to concentrate in the city than migrants from the other&#13;
districts. Ethnicity and distance may be the predisposing factors affecting&#13;
choice of a residential location.&#13;
Annex Table 4 gives the percentage of the total population in each&#13;
of the 3 destination areas in the Western Area composed of in-migrants from&#13;
each of the 12 other districts. In-migrants from Port Loko, Bombali, and&#13;
Moyamba showed the highest representation in each of the Western Area des-&#13;
tination areas (varying from 3.8 percent to 10.6 percent of the specified&#13;
total population). These sending districts are geographically closest to the&#13;
Western Area.&#13;
Geographic Patterns of Migration&#13;
Rural and Urban Patterns of Migration&#13;
Defining an urban center as a district or locality with a population&#13;
of 5,000 persons or more, 20.9 percent of Sierra Leone's population is urban&#13;
(1974). This is reasonable, considering the degree of urbanization in Africa&#13;
has been estimated at 23.9 percent for 1975 by Kingsley Davis (A. F. Aryee,&#13;
1976). Sierra Leone's population is, therefore, dominantly rural. This is&#13;
reflected in the volume of migrants to the Western Area who are of rural&#13;
origin. Out of a sample population of 8,589 migrants in the Western Area,&#13;
5,326 or 62.0 percent were of rural origin. The proportion was highest for&#13;
migrants from the Northern province, where 67.4 percent of them were of rural&#13;
origin. The proportion of rural migrants from the Eastern province was the&#13;
lowest of the three provinces, at 54.6 percent. The reason for these regional&#13;
differences can be explained partially by the degree of urbanization in each&#13;
province. It is 21.4 percent for the Eastern province, and 9.3 pecent for the&#13;
Southern and Northern provinces.&#13;
In addition, cityward migration is mostly undertaken by people of&#13;
rural origin. Out of the migrants enumerated in the city, 4,633 or 64.8&#13;
percent were from rural areas. By contrast, the Western Rural Area attracted&#13;
slightly more migrants from urban than rural centers. Out of the migrants&#13;
enumerated in this area, 743 or 51.7 percent were from urban centers, while&#13;
693 or 48.3 percent were from rural centers. The reason for this lies in&#13;
the close proximity of the city to the Western Rural Area. Out of the urban&#13;
migrants to the Western Rural Area, 498 or 67.0 percent were from the city.&#13;
But this pattern cannot be explained by distance alone. It is a secondary&#13;
factor; a more important reason is because the city has gone through decades&#13;
of social, economic, political, and cultural development. It is also the&#13;
most urbanized center in the country. Since the volume of spatial mobility&#13;
within or out of a region is determined by its level of development, it&#13;
follows that the residents of the city will be more migratory than residents&#13;
in less developed centers. It is not surprising, therefore, that 34.7&#13;
percent of the migrants in the Western Rural Area were from the city.&#13;

Considering only migrants from the provinces to the Western Rural&#13;
Area, there were more who were of rural than urban origin. Migrants of urban&#13;
origin were 17.0 percent of the total migrants from the provinces to the&#13;
Western Rural Area, while the proportion of migrants of rural origin was&#13;
83.0 percent. When all these observations are considered, there is no doubt&#13;
that migration to the Western Area from the rural centers is more important&#13;
than migration from the urban centers. Annex Table 5 shows that out of 5,804&#13;
people who undertook single-stage migrations to the city, 4,169 or 71.8 per-&#13;
cent were from rural centers; and out of 1,020 people who undertook single-&#13;
stage migrations to the Western Rural Area, 607 or 59.0 percent were from&#13;
rural centers.&#13;
The frequencies of single-stage and dual-stage migrations to the&#13;
Western Area are shown in Annex Table 5. Out of the total number of migrants&#13;
enumerated in the Western Area, 6,833 or 79.6 percent undertook single-stage&#13;
migration. This means that 20.4 percent of migrants to the Western Area un-&#13;
dertook dual-stage migrations. This is a considerable proportion, but before&#13;
discussing this phenomenon, the reader should be warned that no previous work&#13;
has been undertaken on dual-stage movement in Sierra Leone. Thus there is no&#13;
scope for comparison. Secondly, the survey was only conducted in one small&#13;
area of the country. Therefore the inferences drawn are based primarily on&#13;
the observations of the survey.&#13;
Dual-Stage Migration&#13;
Only two movements were considered in this questionnaire. These&#13;
were obtained from place-of-birth and place-of-previous residence questions.&#13;
This implies that a migrant made his first movement from his birthplace, and&#13;
his second movement from his place of previous residence. Annex Figure 1 is&#13;
a tree diagram which shows the pattern of flows of internal migration in&#13;
Sierra Leone. It expresses dual-stage migration to the city and the Western&#13;
Rural Area. It is divided into "first origin" (that is, place of birth),&#13;
"second origin" (that, is place of previous residence), and destination (that&#13;
is, the city or the Western Rural Area). The symbols R and U represent the&#13;
rural and urban characteristics of the origin and destination areas, respec-&#13;
tively.&#13;
In Annex Table 5 it was observed that there was a relatively higher&#13;
frequency of migrants in the Western Rural Area whose first movements were&#13;
to the city, than migrants in the city whose first movements were to the&#13;
Western Rural Area. Out of the migrants who undertook dual-stage movements,&#13;
248 or 60.9 percent of those resident in the Western Rural Area were former&#13;
residents of the city. On the contrary, out of those who were enumerated in&#13;
the city, 118 or 8.7 percent had first resided in the Western Rural Area.&#13;
This is a manifestation of the great attraction that the city has for Western&#13;
Area-bound migrants.&#13;
It was observed that 92.9 pecent of the migrants in the Western&#13;
Rural Area whose first migrations were to the city, were born in the Port&#13;
Loko, Kambia, and Bombali districts. This is again, a reflection of the&#13;

familiarity which the peoples of the Northern province have with the&#13;
Western Area. However, when the three provinces were compared, the pattern&#13;
is different. The highest incidence of dual migration was observed among&#13;
migrants from the Eastern province. Second is the Southern province, and&#13;
third is the Northern province. The respective proportions are 40.4 percent,&#13;
27.3 percent, and 11.3 percent. When these proportions are related to the&#13;
distances of the provinces from the city, an interesting observation is&#13;
made. By adopting the provincial headquarters as the areas of origin for&#13;
the provinces the following is revealed:&#13;
1. Kenema, the headquarters for the Eastern province, is&#13;
286 kilometers from the city;&#13;
2. Bo, the headquarters for the Southern province, is 206&#13;
kilometers from the city;&#13;
3. Makeni, the headquarters for the Northern province, is&#13;
188 kilometers from the city.&#13;
As can be seen, these distances correspond to the order of magnitude in dual-&#13;
stage migration from the provinces. That is, the greater the distance, the&#13;
greater is the magnitude of dual-stage migration. In light of this, it is&#13;
plausible that there is step-wise migration in Sierra Leone.&#13;
The highest incidence of dual-stage migration was found among&#13;
migrants from the Eastern province. One reason for this is possibly because&#13;
the Eastern province is the most developed region among the provinces. Kono&#13;
district is rich in diamonds. There is much prospect for making quick money&#13;
in this district and Kenema district, which also benefits from the diamond&#13;
mining activity. Moreover, the Eastern province has the lowest proportion&#13;
of persons employed in agriculture (71.6 percent) compared to the Southern&#13;
province (83.0 percent) and the Northern province (89.5 percent). In addi-&#13;
tion, the Eastern province employs 21.9 percent of the country's workers who&#13;
are employed in industrial establishments with 6 or more workers. The com-&#13;
parative proportions for the Southern and Northern provinces are 15.0 percent&#13;
and 12.4 percent, respectively. The Western Area employs 50.7 percent of the&#13;
country's workers in these industries. The Eastern Province is therefore as&#13;
important an in-migration area as the city is.&#13;
The relatively high incidence of dual-stage migration among migrants&#13;
who were born in the Eastern province reflects the high migration potential&#13;
of people who were born there. There is evidence of seasonal movement in the&#13;
province. It was reported that in 1963, for example, the number of diamond&#13;
diggers averaged 35,600 persons, but it rose to 50,000 persons in some months&#13;
(National Development Plan, 1974). It is common practice for farmers in the&#13;
province to move seasonally between the diamond areas and their villages.&#13;
They move to the diamond areas after the harvest in the dry season (between&#13;
November and April) to occupy themselves in diamond mining. Just before the&#13;
rainy season the farmers return to their villages to cultivate their farms. 1/&#13;
1/   Seasonal movers also circulate between the Eastern and other provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- S.L. 64 -&#13;
Therefore, because of the level of development of the Eastern province,&#13;
its inhabitants have a relatively higher propensity to migrate than those&#13;
of other provinces.&#13;
Because of the level of development of the Eastern province, it&#13;
is not surprising that none of the migrants who were born there and had&#13;
undertaken a previous migration before moving to the city reported that the&#13;
Western Rural Area was their place of previous residence. This observation&#13;
suggests that when a person born in the Eastern province decides to migrate&#13;
to the Western Area, he goes to a place that is more developed than his place&#13;
of birth--a place where he can be employed or educated, as well as enjoy&#13;
modern social amenities. Consequently his destination is almost invariably&#13;
the city. It is evident that 2 factors are important contributors to dual-&#13;
stage migration to the Western Area. These are:&#13;
(i) economic development at source; and&#13;
(ii) distance between source and destination.&#13;
Demographic Patterns of Migration&#13;
Age&#13;
Annex Tables 6a-6e and Annex Figure 2 show the age pattern of&#13;
migrants in absolute, relative, and graphic form. The most migratory people&#13;
are young adults. They constitute 38.1 percent of total migrants to the&#13;
city and 36.3 percent of those in the Western Area. The peak ages of&#13;
migration to the Western Area were 25-29 years. This finding is in keeping&#13;
with the findings of other researchers in Sierra Leone, Ghana, India and&#13;
Chile.&#13;
Sex&#13;
The sex ratio of all migrants in the Western Area was high (see&#13;
Annex Table 6c). It was 112.2 males per 100 females. The sex ratio of&#13;
migrants from the provinces was higher (see Annex Table 6d). It was 115.1.&#13;
This implies that there were more migrant males than females. The reason for&#13;
this pattern is related to the sex ratios for the total population&#13;
of the various regions in Sierra Leone. Annex Table 7 shows the sex ratios of&#13;
the country, provinces and districts in 1963. In column 6 it is seen that the&#13;
sex ratios of Sierra Leone and the Southern and Northern provinces are low.&#13;
Furthermore, under Column 5, where most potential migrants belong, the sex&#13;
ratios are low in all the districts. It is also low for Sierra Leone as a&#13;
whole. The exceptions are Kenema and Kono districts, which are in-migration&#13;
areas. These low sex ratios reflect the out-migration of males, many of whom&#13;
go to the the Western Area in search of employment opportunities.&#13;

Annex Table 8 shows the sex ratios of migrants from each province&#13;
to the Western Area, classified by urban and rural areas of origin. The data&#13;
suggest that migrants from urban areas have higher sex ratios than migrants&#13;
from rural areas. This is a reflection of the relatively higher sex ratios&#13;
among urban residents than rural residents in Sierra Leone. In Annex Figure&#13;
3 the sex ratios of migrants, non-migrants, and the total population enumerated&#13;
in the city and the Western Area are portrayed in line graphs.&#13;
Social and Economic Characteristics&#13;
Ethnicity&#13;
In 1963, the Temne were found to constitute 29.8 percent of the&#13;
total population of Sierra Leone. They ranked second to the Mende, which&#13;
formed 30.9 percent of the total population. The 1975 survey revealed that&#13;
the Temne were the most migratory ethnic group to the Western Area (see Annex&#13;
Tables 9a and 9b). Out of a total of 7,153 migrants to the city, 2,548 or&#13;
35.6 percent were reported to be Temnes. Their sex ratio was 102.9. The&#13;
proportion of Temne migrants to the Western Rural Area was higher at 47.2&#13;
percent but the sex ratio was lower, at 89.9.&#13;
Education&#13;
Annex Table 10 shows the educational differentials between migrants&#13;
and non-migrants 5 years of age and over, in terms of lack of formal education.&#13;
Those who had never attended school are referred to here as uneducated; and&#13;
those who have attended or are attending school are referred to as educated.&#13;
Out of a total of 8,155 sample migrants in the Western Area who are&#13;
5 years of age and over, 4,144 or 50.8 percent had had no formal education.&#13;
There is a difference in the percentage uneducated among migrants in the city&#13;
and in the Western Rural Area. Out of 6,819 migrants in the city, 3,298 or&#13;
48.4 percent were uneducated. The comparative proportion in the Western Rural&#13;
Area was 63.3 percent.&#13;
There were 17.4 percent more uneducated migrant females than males&#13;
in the Western Area. This difference was greater in the city than the Western&#13;
Rural Area. In the city there were 18.9 percent more uneducated females than&#13;
males. But in the Western Rural Area the difference was 9.4 percent. This&#13;
implies that relatively more educated males than females migrate to the city.&#13;
The data further show that 49.2 percent of the cityward migrants&#13;
were educated. This percentage was higher for males than for females. Out&#13;
of the male migrants in question, 57.3 percent were educated; but for the&#13;
females the proportion of educated was 39.9 percent. In the Western Rural&#13;
Area 60.4 percent of the male migrants were educated, and 41.5 percent of the&#13;
female migrants were educated. It is apparent that male migrant selectivity&#13;
by educational status is plausible.&#13;

There is a wide gap between migrants and non-migrants by educa-&#13;
tional status. Annex Table 10 shows there are more educated persons among&#13;
non-migrants (84.2 percent) than migrants (49.2 percent) in the Western&#13;
Area.&#13;
Occupational Activities and Educational Attainment&#13;
Out of a total of 3,206 male workers 1/ who were enumerated in&#13;
Greater Freetown, 70.1 percent were migrants. But only 46.4 percent of the&#13;
male migrant workers were educated, while 79.7 percent of the non-migrant&#13;
male workers were educated.&#13;
To analyze migrant and non-migrant differentials by occupational&#13;
status, the following categories of workers were considered: uneducated&#13;
workers; workers with primary education; and workers with secondary school&#13;
education. Only males have been considered in the analysis because migrants&#13;
who move for economic reasons are usually male.&#13;
Using correlation analysis by the differential proportion tech-&#13;
nique, we find the following in Greater Freetown (Annex Table lla):&#13;
1. Among the uneducated workers, there were relatively more&#13;
migrants in the professional and unskilled laborers&#13;
category of workers. The non-migrants dominated the rest&#13;
of the occupational categories, though the differentials&#13;
were low.&#13;
2. Among the employed persons with primary education, the&#13;
indices of dissimilarity were less than those for workers&#13;
with no education.&#13;
3. At the secondary educational level, the first 3 occupa-&#13;
tional groups were dominated by non-migrants. The groups&#13;
in question were the professional, administrative, and&#13;
clerical. Moreover, the differentials were relatively&#13;
higher at the top occupational levels.&#13;
Thus, there is a positive relationship between education and occu-&#13;
pational status in Greater Freetown. A similar analysis for the Western&#13;
Rural Area (Annex Table llb) revealed a somewhat similar pattern although&#13;
highly educated migrants appeared to occupy the higher status jobs to a&#13;
greater degree than non-migrants. This is in contrast to the pattern found&#13;
in Greater Freetown.&#13;
1. Among the uneducated, migrants dominated most occupations&#13;
except those in the clerical and transport fields and the&#13;
farming and fishing category.&#13;
1/   A total of 3,298 workers were enumerated in Greater Freetown, but 92&#13;
having a post-secondary education were excluded from this analysis due&#13;
to their small number.&#13;

2. Among the employed with a primary education, the index of&#13;
dissimilarity was lowest.&#13;
3. The index of dissimilarity was highest among migrant and&#13;
non-migrant workers with a secondary education. Migrants&#13;
had a higher proportion in professional, sales, service,&#13;
and armed forces jobs than non-migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. CAUSES OF MIGRATION&#13;
The questionnaire included open-ended questions asking migrants why&#13;
they moved to the Western Area. Field observations suggest there were many&#13;
reasons affecting the migrant's decision. These were mainly economic, social,&#13;
or psychological in nature; and included employment, education, marriage,&#13;
housing, recreation, visits, and convenience to work.&#13;
There were also reasons which can be classified as ephiphenomenal&#13;
because they appear to be concomitant to the primary reason for moving. For&#13;
example, a person may have migrated to find work but reported that he migrated&#13;
to visit a friend or relative if he was still unemployed at the time of enu-&#13;
meration. Because of the open-ended nature of the questions, a considerable&#13;
number of migrants gave reasons which could be classified as psychological or&#13;
epiphenomenal. There were also migrants who could not give any reason for&#13;
moving; most were people who migrated within the Western Area. This is a re-&#13;
flection of the high degree of urbanization in the region, which gives rise&#13;
to much intra-regional mobility among its inhabitants.&#13;
Two classifications of migration by reason for moving were adopted&#13;
here. The first classification is voluntary, obligatory, and sequential migra-&#13;
tion (see Gupta, 1962). This provides scope for the division of migrants into&#13;
those who moved on their own initiative, those who were obliged to move because&#13;
of the nature of their jobs, and those who moved in response to the movement&#13;
of the head of the family or other relatives. The second classification is&#13;
economic, socio-cultural, and psycho-epiphenominal reasons for moving.&#13;
Annex Table 12a shows that 36.3 percent of the migrants in the&#13;
Western Area moved voluntarily. Fifty-seven percent of the migrants moved&#13;
with, or to join their parents, guardians, friends or spouses. The data&#13;
revealed that migration to the Western Area was sequential in nature. This&#13;
pattern appeared to be sensitive to the differential ability of men and women&#13;
to migrate. Males appeared to migrate first, with their families following.&#13;
Therefore voluntary migration was higher than the other types of migration&#13;
among males. This was especially so with regard to cityward migration. Over&#13;
85 percent of migration among females was of the sequential type. In the&#13;
Western Area, 86.4 percent of female migration was sequential while only 9.6&#13;
percent was voluntary.&#13;
The difference between voluntary and sequential migration was less&#13;
for males than for females. In the city, for example, the difference between&#13;
voluntary and sequential migrations for males was 31.1 percent; but for females&#13;
it was 75.7 percent. In the Western Rural Area, the corresponding differences&#13;
were 22 percent for males and 81.6 percent for females. Since the only reason&#13;
classified as obligatory was an economic one, it is not surprising that there&#13;
were more males than females among obligatory migrants. The pattern was the&#13;
same for both the city and the Western Rural Area.&#13;

- S.L. 84 -&#13;
It appears from Annex Table 12b that socio-cultural factors were&#13;
the most important cause of migration to the Western Area. Some writers,&#13;
including Imoagene (1967), have emphasized the dominant role of socio-cultural&#13;
or psychosocial factors in migration over the economic factors. Economic&#13;
factors constituted 27 percent of the total reasons for moving, while socio-&#13;
cultural factors contributed 46.5 percent. The psycho-epiphenominal causes&#13;
of migration were almost as important as the economic causes.&#13;
When age-specific causes of migration were examined, a new pattern&#13;
was observed. Among males the economic reasons for moving were of greatest&#13;
importance; 37.1 percent of male migrants had gone to the city to find work.&#13;
Most of those in this category came from the provinces. The comparative&#13;
proportion for females was 1.3 percent. In the Western Rural Area, 29.6 per-&#13;
cent of the male migrants had gone in search of jobs.&#13;
Many more males moved out of the city to the Western Rural Area for&#13;
economic reasons than was the case with migration from the Western Rural Area&#13;
to the city. Out of all male migrants from the city to the Western Rural&#13;
Area, 37.3 percent went in search of employment. But the proportion which&#13;
went to the city from the Western Rural Area for the same reason was 19.8&#13;
percent. This pattern is plausible for the following reasons:&#13;
(1) Many of the migrants to the Western Rural Area from the&#13;
city who went to find work would be people who had first&#13;
migrated to the city for the same reason, but failed to&#13;
get a job;&#13;
(2) The proximity of the 2 areas makes it possible for most po-&#13;
tential male migrants in the Western Rural Area to be better&#13;
informed than people of the provinces about employment oppor-&#13;
tunities in the city. Therefore, fewer people will migrate&#13;
within a short distance to find work if the opportunities for&#13;
employment at destination are low. It is not surprising there-&#13;
fore that the highest proportion of male migrants who moved&#13;
to the city to find work came from Koinadugu district (53.3&#13;
percent). Koinadugu is one of the farthest and most remote&#13;
districts from the city.&#13;
The proportion of migrants that any district will send to the city&#13;
for employment reasons is affected by communications, and economic develop-&#13;
ment at source. This is reflected in the proportion of male migrants who&#13;
came from Kono district to the city to look for work. Kono district sent&#13;
the lowest proportion, 26.6 percent, to the city for this reason. But Kambia&#13;
district sent 42.2 percent; Bombali district, 43.5 percent; and Tonkolili&#13;
district, 41.3 percent of their male migrants to the city to find work.&#13;
Compared to males, the proportion of females who migrated to the&#13;
Western Area for economic reasons was very low (see Annex Table 12b). The&#13;
greatest proportion of them moved for socio-cultural reasons. Out of all the&#13;
female migrants to the city, 65.0 percent moved for these reasons. The cor-&#13;
responding proportion in the Western Rural Area was 59.4 percent. This&#13;

pattern is a reflection of the sequential nature of their migration. This&#13;
is manifested in the volume of female migrants who reported that they mi-&#13;
grated because of marriage to a man who had migrated to the same area (41.7&#13;
percent). The comparative proportion for female migrants in the Western Rural&#13;
Area was 41.6 percent.&#13;
Less females moved to the Western Area for educational reasons than&#13;
males. Parents in the provinces are more willing to allow their sons to&#13;
migrate to the city for educational reasons than their daughters. One of the&#13;
reasons lies in the fear that their daughters may resort to prostitution in&#13;
the city. This is especially so with parents in the Northern province. The&#13;
highest sending areas of females for educational reasons are the Southern and&#13;
Eastern provinces. This is a reflection of the relative development of educa-&#13;
tion in these provinces.&#13;
Psycho-Epiphenominal Reasons for Moving&#13;
Out of the total migrants enumerated in the city and the Western&#13;
Rural Area, less than 1 percent reported that they moved to these areas be-&#13;
cause of the social amenities existing there. A few other migrants responded&#13;
that they moved because of "convenience". These may be secondary reasons.&#13;
Over 17.0 percent of male migrants to the Western Area reported&#13;
their reason for moving as a visit or stay with relatives. Although it is&#13;
possible that a visitor's duration of residence can qualify him for a migrant&#13;
status, the proportion of males who were affected is high (see Annex Table&#13;
12b). One reason for this may be the fact that most of the canvassing was&#13;
done in the Krio language. The Krio translation for visitor is "tranger"&#13;
(which literally means "stranger" in English). It is probable that many of&#13;
those who were reported as "trangers" and recorded as "visitors" were actually&#13;
migrants who moved to find a job or attend school. Secondly, there is the&#13;
possibility of misstatement of reasons for moving.&#13;
Duration of Residence&#13;
Annex Table 13 gives the percentage distribution of male migrants&#13;
in the city classified by duration of residence and reason for moving. In&#13;
the city the proportion of longterm male migrants who reportedly moved in&#13;
search of employment was 49.2 percent. Among more recent migrants, less than&#13;
30 percent moved to the city for this reason. The data for the Western Rural&#13;
Area indicated that the opposite was true there. Among the longterm male mi-&#13;
grants, 31.5 percent had moved to the Western Rural Area to find work, but the&#13;
equivalent proportion for current migrants was 37.6 percent. This pattern is&#13;
plausible because a high proportion of males move for economic reasons. Assum-&#13;
ing that farming and fishing activities in the Western Rural Area offer oppor-&#13;
tunities for employment to migrants who would have wished to move to the city,&#13;
the economic factor has much influence on migration to the Western Rural Area.&#13;

Thus, in the city there appeared to be some association between males&#13;
who migrated with the aim of finding work and length of residence. That is,&#13;
the longer the duration of residence, the higher the proportion of persons who&#13;
migrated to find work in the city (see Annex Table 13).&#13;
A contrasting pattern was observed for male migrants who moved for&#13;
socio-cultural reasons. Out of the male migrants who had stayed for less than&#13;
one year, 39.3 percent had migrated for socio-cultural reasons. But the cor-&#13;
responding proportions for those who had stayed for 10 - 14 years was 28.7&#13;
percent. Among the longterm migrants, it was 20.9 percent. The table also&#13;
indicated that 21.9 percent of the male migrants who had stayed for less than&#13;
6 months had moved for psycho-epiphenominal reasons. But the corresponding&#13;
proportion for those who had stayed for 10 - 14 years was 13.4 percent; and&#13;
for longterm migrants it was 15.5 percent. 1/&#13;
The above observations suggest that in the year preceding 1960,&#13;
economic factors were of much greater importance than now as motivators for&#13;
cityward migration.&#13;
1/   The residual category, "Other", is excluded from this analysis.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Liberia's total land area is 97,920 sq. km; its population was&#13;
1,688,000 in mid-1977. Its enumerated population was 1,016,000 in 1962 and&#13;
1,503,000 in 1974; and population densities (persons per square kilometer)&#13;
were 10.4 and 15.4 respectively in 1962 and 1974. Spatial distribution of&#13;
the population is quite uneven. In 1974, about 3 of every 10 persons in&#13;
Liberia were living in Montserrado County which contains the national capi-&#13;
tal, Monrovia. As a further illustration, the population density per square&#13;
kilometer in 1974 varied from a low of 4.3 persons in Grand Gedeh County to&#13;
a high of 67.4 in Montserrado County.&#13;
The country's sex ratio has varied over time. In 1962, there were&#13;
only 98 males per 100 females; in 1974 there were 102 males per 100 females.&#13;
The population has a young age structure; and the proportion of the&#13;
population in the younger ages increased over the intercensal period&#13;
(1962-74). Forty-one percent of the total population were in the age group&#13;
0-14 years in 1974.&#13;
About 29 percent of the population in 1974 lived in urban areas.&#13;
The country has both high fertility and moderately high mortality.&#13;
The crude birth rate was about 50 and the crude death rate about 18 per 1000&#13;
population during the early part of this decade. Thus the natural growth&#13;
rate of the population was slightly more than 3.0 percent per year. Because&#13;
of net immigration, the rate of population growth was slightly higher, about&#13;
3.4 percent per annum during 1962 - 1974.&#13;
Net immigration of aliens into Liberia appears to be quite small.&#13;
In 1974, only 59,000 persons in Liberia, or 4 percent of the total population,&#13;
were foreign-born. About one-half of them were located in Montserrado County,&#13;
another one-third were divided equally between the counties of Lofa and Nimba.&#13;
These migrations to Lofa and Nimba seem to be associated with major agricul-&#13;
tural development and iron ore mining projects there.&#13;
The net lifetime gain to migration during 1962-74 was only about&#13;
28,000 persons, or 1.9 percent of the total population, in 1974. This gain&#13;
raised the intercensal rate of population growth only marginally.&#13;
Of the 59,000 persons in 1974 who were born outside Liberia, 13,000&#13;
(22 percent) were citizen immigrants and 46,000 (78 percent) were alien immi-&#13;
grants. About 95 percent of the citizen immigrants came from African coun-&#13;
tries, mainly the bordering countries of Guinea, Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone&#13;
which together contributed three-fourths of the total. Ghana was the other&#13;
African country to send a substantial number (13 percent) of citizen immi-&#13;
grants to Liberia. Migration streams between Liberia and its neighbouring&#13;
countries appeared to cancel each other. Further, the populations of neigh-&#13;
boring countries were larger than that of Liberia. Thus, international migra-&#13;
tion appeared to have a negligible demographic effect on Liberia and its&#13;
neighbours. The largest international migration stream affecting Liberia was&#13;
- L.1 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- L.2 -&#13;
that between Liberia and Guinea. This was followed by the streams between&#13;
Liberia and Sierra Leone and Liberia and Ivory Coast (at about one-half of&#13;
the migration between Liberia and Guinea).&#13;
In 1962, only two-thirds of the alien immigrants came from African&#13;
countries, with Ghana sending 26 percent of all the aliens. The other African&#13;
countries sending significant numbers of alien immigrants to Liberia were&#13;
Guinea (19.2 percent), Sierra Leone (9.8 percent), Mali (2.0 percent), Ivory&#13;
Coast (1.8 percent), and Nigeria (1.3 percent). Among the non-African&#13;
countries, only the United States of America and Lebanon sent more than 5 per-&#13;
cent of all alien immigrants to Liberia. The respective percentages were 7.7&#13;
and 9.7. Other countries sending alien immigrants into Liberia were Italy (3&#13;
percent), Netherlands (2.3 percent), Spain (2.2 percent), Sweden (1.8&#13;
percent), and United Kingdom (1.4 percent).&#13;
International migration was predominantly by males. Most of the&#13;
immigrants (above 90 percent), were below 45 years of age; and the male immi-&#13;
grants were on average 5 years older than their female counterparts.&#13;
Immigrants to Liberia did not show any distinct favour for residence&#13;
in either rural or urban areas; but most of the emigrants (68 percent) in&#13;
1970 originated in a rural area.&#13;
A great population triangle is being formed in Liberia. In 1962,&#13;
it included Montserrado County, Western and Central Provinces; in 1974, it&#13;
included Montserrado, Bong, Lofa, and Nimba Counties. This great triangle&#13;
contained 71 percent of Liberia's population in 1974, on 48 percent of the&#13;
total land area. It accommodated 85 percent of the lifetime immigrants in&#13;
1974. One in every 2 lifetime immigrants was living in Montserrado County,&#13;
and 1 in every 6 was living in Lofa and Nimba Counties each.&#13;
In spite of the low volume of international migration into or out&#13;
of Liberia, its impact on Liberia's economy is substantial. This is due to&#13;
the shortage of trained and skilled manpower in the country. Most of the&#13;
managerial, executive, and technical positions in various establishments are&#13;
held by expatriates. In addition, several small- and large-scale business&#13;
enterprises are partly or solely owned by expatriates. Although this situa-&#13;
tion is gradually changing, the pace of change is very slow, and the situa-&#13;
tion is unlikely to change substantially in the near future.&#13;
Unlike international migration, internal migration was quite sub-&#13;
stantial in Liberia. In 1962, 17 percent of the population born in Liberia&#13;
were enumerated outside their county/province of birth. By 1974, about 21&#13;
percent of all those born in Liberia were enumerated outside their county&#13;
of birth. Because of extensive boundary changes in 1964, the data relating&#13;
to internal migration available from the 2 recent censuses are not directly&#13;
comparable. However, they convey 2 broad generalities: (1) the incidence&#13;
of internal migration has accelerated, and (2) the sex differential in inter-&#13;
nal migration has narrowed over the intercensal period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- L.3 -&#13;
Most of the internal migration streams are directed toward Mont-&#13;
serrado County which contains the national capital. This county was the uni-&#13;
versal gainer as a result of population exchanges between counties and pro-&#13;
vinces and absorbed as much as 82 percent of the total net gains experienced&#13;
by these areal units in 1962. By 1974 this county increased its share to 88&#13;
percent. Some of the dominant net streams in 1974 were Lofa - Montserrado&#13;
(44,000), Grand Bassa - Montserrado (41,000), and Bong - Montserrado (40,000).&#13;
During the intercensal period, 1962 - 1974, 4 counties, Grand Cape&#13;
Mount, Grand Gedeh, Montserrado and Nimba, experienced net gains in their&#13;
populaton due to migration. The highest gain (75,000) occurred in Mont-&#13;
serrado. Grande Cape Mount and Nimba counties followed Montserrado, but the&#13;
net gains there were only 9,000 and 7,000 persons. In Grand Gedeh County,&#13;
in- and out-migration almost counter-balanced one another. The heaviest net&#13;
loss occurred in Grand Bassa County (35,000).&#13;
Young adults in the age group 15-29 years were the most prevalent&#13;
migrants. One in every 3 males aged 15-29 years in Liberia in 1962 was a&#13;
migrant. This was closely followed by males in the age group 30-44 years,&#13;
with a 28 percent out-migration rate. The out-migration rates for females&#13;
were generally lower than those for males. The age pattern of lifetime out-&#13;
migration in 1974 was similar to that in 1962. However, the age groupings&#13;
employed in 1974 brought out certain factors which were probably concealed&#13;
by the 1962 data. The highest out-migration rate for males was noted in the&#13;
age group 25-34 years, while for females it occurred in the age group 15-24&#13;
years. The age-specific out-migration rates also indicated a general rise&#13;
in the incidence of lifetime migration during 1962 - 1974.&#13;
Males were more migratory than females. In 1962, male lifetime&#13;
migrants outnumbered females by a ratio of 149:100. This advantage had de-&#13;
creased by 20 points at the time of the second census in 1974. Female&#13;
migrants were mostly concentrated in the younger age groups.&#13;
In 1974, 14 percent of the population born and enumerated in Liberia&#13;
were displaced from their place of birth. The displacement index increased&#13;
from 9.7 percent in 1962 to 13.9 percent in 1974. This increase is indicative&#13;
of the acceleration of internal migration in Liberia.&#13;
In general, most of the migrants moved into neighbouring areas, es-&#13;
pecially from counties adjoining Montserrado county. Distant (from Mont-&#13;
serrado) counties which had low out-migration to neighbouring areas had rela-&#13;
tively high out-migration to Montserrado. Thus, the availability of economic&#13;
and social opportunities in Montserrado appeared to out-weigh the distance&#13;
of move for migrants within Liberia.&#13;
Between 1962 and 1974, the urban population of Liberia increased by&#13;
239,000. Of this, about 144,000 resulted from rural to urban migration and re-&#13;
classification of areas. This addition to the urban population was 11.4 percent&#13;
of the average population of the country during the intercensal period. Most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- L.4 -&#13;
of the rural-urban migration was directed toward Monrovia, the national capi-&#13;
tal, and other major centers of socio-economic activity. It is estimated&#13;
that Monrovia had a net gain of about 41,000 people as a result of migration&#13;
during 1962-74 from the rural areas. Its gain was 28 percent of the total&#13;
change in the urban population due to rural-urban migration and reclassifi-&#13;
cation of areas.&#13;
The most important reason for migration in Liberia was economic --&#13;
seeking work and/or taking work. In the ages 15 and over, 1 in every 3 male&#13;
migrants to urban areas and 1 in every 5 male migrants to rural areas moved&#13;
for these reasons. The next most important reason for male migration (1 in&#13;
10) was education, while that for female migration was marriage (12 percent).&#13;
Unspecified reasons for migration accounted for more than one-half of the&#13;
total migration in Liberia. Probably this aspect of migration makes the pro-&#13;
cess of rural-urban migration unstable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The history of Liberia is a story of migration - both international&#13;
and internal. Based on the limited source material available, Gnielinski has&#13;
given a concise account of the migration that Liberia experienced since 1461.&#13;
He observed that, "Most tribes reached their present areas during the first&#13;
half of the 19th century infiltrating the country from the northeast follow-&#13;
ing a pattern of migration from the savanna in the rainforest" (Gnielinski,&#13;
1970). This migration most probably took place gradually and arose as a re-&#13;
sult of expeditions heading toward the coast in search of salt; it was aug-&#13;
mented by the favourable agricultural and economic conditions and the avail-&#13;
ability of land. Concurrently, another gradual movement occurred from the&#13;
coastal to the interior regions. In spite of these movements, the central&#13;
part of Liberia remained thinly populated.&#13;
Another significant migration into Liberia occurred around 1821&#13;
when immigrant Africans arrived from America. This movement proved to be&#13;
the turning point in the history of the country, which was declared a repub-&#13;
lic in 1847.&#13;
The "Open Door and Unification Policies", adopted by the country&#13;
under President William V. S. Tubman (who served from 1944 until his death in&#13;
1971), introduced a new wave of economic and social change in Liberia and&#13;
thereby stimulated a new pattern of international and internal migrations in&#13;
the country. 1/ Development (including travel facilities), during and after&#13;
World War II encouraged a rapid growth of population in the capital city and a&#13;
few other areas of recent economic activity (such as mines and industrial&#13;
enterprises). Much of this growth has resulted from rural to urban migration.&#13;
Liberia's long history of migration unfortunately cannot be quanti-&#13;
fied due to lack of data. However, for recent years, a fairly realistic&#13;
picture can be drawn from the data obtained in the population censuses of 1962&#13;
and 1974 and in the demographic surveys conducted during 1970 and 1971. Using&#13;
these sources, the present paper attempts to measure the international and in-&#13;
ternal migration, describe the characteristics of migrants, and assess the&#13;
causes and consequences of such migration.&#13;
Sources of Data&#13;
In 1961 Frank Lorimer wrote, "The only countries for which popula-&#13;
tion estimates are still a mere guess, without any substantial basis, are&#13;
Ethiopia and Liberia". Since then the status of demographic statistics in&#13;
Liberia has improved rapidly. Two complete population censuses have been&#13;
1/   The "unification" policy ended discrimination against tribespeople,&#13;
while the "open door" policy encouraged United States and European&#13;
development of Liberian natural resources.&#13;
- L.5 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- L.6 -&#13;
conducted:  one on April 2, 1962, and the other on February 1, 1974.    In&#13;
addition, a country-wide longitudinal population growth survey (LPGS) was&#13;
launched in 1969. This survey, originally planned for five years, had to be&#13;
discontinued later in order to prepare for the 1974 Census of Population and&#13;
Housing. The data from LPGS are, however, available for the years 1970 and&#13;
1971.&#13;
The Vital Statistics System in Liberia is governed by the Liberian&#13;
Public Health and Safety Laws of 1956. The original legislation was approved&#13;
in 1931-32, and organized registration of deaths and births began (respec-&#13;
tively) in 1934 and 1936. This source, however, is not a substantial aid to&#13;
demographic research because of its incomplete coverage and lack of published&#13;
statistics.&#13;
Migration Data from Population Censuses&#13;
Both international and internal migration data are derived from&#13;
two questions - place of birth and citizenship - which were asked of every&#13;
individual enumerated in the 2 censuses of Liberia. For all those born out-&#13;
side Liberia, the country of birth and citizenship were recorded in both&#13;
censuses. For all those born in Liberia, the town or township, city, or&#13;
district of birth was recorded in 1962. The data were, however, made avail-&#13;
able only by major administrative divisions of the country; namely, county/&#13;
territory, province. In 1974, only the county of birth was recorded for&#13;
each individual born in Liberia. The Enumerator's Handbook contained instruc-&#13;
tions to record country/territory of birth, but this was not consistently&#13;
followed throughout the country.&#13;
The data for the study of international migration (immigration only)&#13;
come from the following three tables (PC - B of the 1962 Census):&#13;
-    Persons born in Liberia and born abroad by age and sex;&#13;
-    Foreign-born population by citizenship and place of birth;&#13;
-    Citizenship of the population by age and sex.&#13;
The data from the 1974 census contain similar tables.&#13;
The study of internal migration is based principally on the classi-&#13;
fication of persons by their places of birth and usual residence at the time&#13;
of census. In addition, the spatial distribution of the population, as ob-&#13;
tained from the 2 censuses by administrative divisions of the country at the&#13;
time of the 1974 census, can be used to obtain an estimate of the balance of&#13;
internal migration across administrative boundaries of the country. The age&#13;
distribution of persons inhabiting different counties and territories, as ob-&#13;
tained from the 2 censuses, cannot be used to estimate the flow of internal&#13;
migration in Liberia during the intercensal period mainly because of extensive&#13;
boundary changes between censuses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- L.7 -&#13;
Liberian Population Growth Survey (LPGS)&#13;
The LPGS was designed to generate estimates of population and var-&#13;
ious characteristics for the entire country, for rural areas (localities with&#13;
2,000 or less inhabitants), and for urban areas (localities with more than&#13;
2,000 inhabitants) separately. One hundred villages selected randomly from&#13;
50 clans (lowest administrative division of the country), constituted the&#13;
rural sample; and 100 urban blocks, randomly selected and each consisting of&#13;
approximately 200 inhabitants, constituted the urban sample. The survey&#13;
covered 5 percent of the total population of Liberia who usually reside in&#13;
single and multiple dwelling units in the selected areas. Persons in the&#13;
following categories were excluded: hospital patients; military and police&#13;
personnel in barracks; persons residing in hotels, schools, or longterm in-&#13;
stitutions; and non-Liberians in concession compounds, missions, embassies,&#13;
university, etc. Data on immigration and emigration, along with other demo-&#13;
graphic information, such as sex, age, time of migration, reasons for migra-&#13;
tion, place of origin, and length of intended residence were obtained in the&#13;
survey.&#13;
In the LPGS, a migrant was defined as any person moving into or out&#13;
of a household with the intention of remaining or staying away for either an&#13;
indefinite period of time, or for over 30 days. If these conditions did not&#13;
hold true, the individual was counted as a usual resident. This was a clear&#13;
departure from the time concept of two months' residence in order to be&#13;
counted as a usual resident, as in the population censuses of Liberia. The&#13;
short duration of stay used in classifying a person as a migrant in the LPGS&#13;
is likely to exaggerate the volume of migration by including visitors and tem-&#13;
porary migrants. The exaggeration in the case of rural-urban migration is&#13;
quite substantial and likely to give a misleading picture of the process of&#13;
urbanization in the country.&#13;
The yearly rounds of the LPGS extended from May to April of the&#13;
following year. The data were collected through household enquiry following&#13;
the dual record system. The estimates of true value of demographic events&#13;
were obtained by the Chandrasekar-Deming (see LPGS, M-1) formula after match-&#13;
ing records of 2 independent sets of investigators. One set of investigators&#13;
(local resident enumerators), continued work in the field (throughout the&#13;
year) and recorded events on a monthly basis. The other set (team of central&#13;
staff/supervisors), visited the selected areas at an interval of 6 months&#13;
and collected retrospective data on demographic events and other socio-&#13;
economic characteristics for the previous 6 months. The events were matched,&#13;
and differences were verified in the field.&#13;
In the case of migration, however, it was observed that, unlike re-&#13;
cording births and deaths by the 2 systems of enumeration, the monthly system&#13;
always recorded more migrations than the six-monthly system. Further, field&#13;
verification of differences between the recordings by the 2 systems in many&#13;
cases was not possible because, "The migrants were no longer present to&#13;
acknowledge the occurrence and neighbours could not substantiate the informa-&#13;
tion" (see M-1). Several migrations missed by both systems were located by&#13;
the office editors. The difficulties were such that migration data were not&#13;
adjusted by the Chandrasekar - Deming formula.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- L.8 -&#13;
To gather migration stream data, LPGS considered 4 origins and 4&#13;
destinations, as (1) moved within this place or locality, (2) moved to or from&#13;
a rural area, (3) moved to or from an urban locality, and (4) moved to or from&#13;
a country outside Liberia. These points of origin or destination were then&#13;
related to the location of the sampling units in rural and urban areas, and&#13;
the direction of the migration streams were established. Thus, data from&#13;
LPGS enable one to study international, rural-urban, urban-rural, intra-&#13;
rural as well as intra-urban migration. Further, the survey identified mi-&#13;
grants by 2 approaches: (1) those who moved into the sampling area (in-&#13;
migration approach), and (2) those who moved out of the sampling area (out-&#13;
migration approach). The published figures provide national estimates of&#13;
the various migration streams.&#13;
The examination of published data on rural-urban migration from&#13;
the LPGS for 1970 and 1971 showed that the 2 approaches (in-migration and&#13;
out-migration) did not yield consistent estimates of the volume of migration.&#13;
For example, in 1970, the in-migration approach showed that 141,156 persons&#13;
in rural areas came from urban areas and 43,580 persons in urban areas came&#13;
from rural areas. Thus, the exchange of population between rural and urban&#13;
areas resulted in an estimated net loss of 97,576 persons for urban areas.&#13;
On the other hand, the out-migration approach showed that 122,112 persons left&#13;
rural areas to live in urban localities and 28,790 persons did the reverse;&#13;
thus, giving an estimated net gain of 93,322 persons to urban areas. This&#13;
inconsistency is not satisfactorily explained in the LPGS publications on&#13;
migration. Siaplay (1973) discredited the data obtained through in-migration&#13;
without any legitimate reason and used the other set to study the rural-urban&#13;
migration in Liberia. However, a thorough scrutiny of the data indicated that&#13;
the inconsistency between the in-migration data and out-migration data did not&#13;
stem from defective enumeration as claimed by an LPGS publication (M-1). In-&#13;
stead it was caused by the mistaken interchange of inflation factors which&#13;
were used to obtain the national estimates of rural-to-urban and urban-to-&#13;
rural migration from data generated through the in-migration approach.&#13;
Apparently urban-to-rural migration in 1970 was inflated by the factor (36)&#13;
used for the inflation of rural totals, and rural-to-urban migrations were&#13;
inflated by the factor (10) used for inflation of urban totals. When the&#13;
published data were converted into original sample counts and reinflated&#13;
by using appropriate factors, the national estimates that followed were sat-&#13;
isfactory and consistent. For example, the reinflated rural-to-urban&#13;
migration from the in-migration approach was obtained as 156,888 (43,580 X&#13;
36 t 10), and urban-to-rural migration was obtained as 39,210 (141,156 X&#13;
10 - 36). This gave a net gain to urban areas in the amount of 177,678&#13;
persons. It is consistent with the direction of the net-migration stream&#13;
observed through the out-migration approach. As regards magnitude, it is&#13;
logical to believe that the in-migration approach will normally yield higher&#13;
estimates than the out-migration approach. Hence the entire data on rural-&#13;
urban migration from LPGS obtained through the in-migration approach and&#13;
used in the present study were reinflated in the manner explained above. The&#13;
rural and urban samples in 1971 were respectively inflated by 38.2 and 9.5.&#13;
After this adjustment, the data appeared to be satisfactory for our study.&#13;
In spite of this, we agree with the views expressed in an LPGS publication&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- L.9 -&#13;
that, "migration data ... should not be regarded as a definitive statement of&#13;
absolute magnitude, but only as an indication of the general flow of persons&#13;
into or out of the country or within Liberia" (M-1). Here we add that, to&#13;
minimize fluctuations and improve reliability (United Nations, 1970), we will&#13;
study rural-urban migration on the basis of average figures obtained in the&#13;
LPGS for the years 1970 and 1971. Since the out-migration approach, by its&#13;
nature, is likely to underestimate the volume of migration, in our discussion&#13;
we will use the data collected through the in-migration approach. However,&#13;
for comparative purposes, the tables in the report contain data collected&#13;
through both approaches.&#13;
Areal Units&#13;
At the time of the 1974 Census, Liberia was divided into 9 admin-&#13;
istrative counties. Four of the five coastal counties had 5 territories in&#13;
their areal sub-set. In our analysis we will only consider the counties;&#13;
the territories will be included in the counties of which they are a sub-set.&#13;
The location and names of the counties and territories are listed below and&#13;

II. DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND&#13;
The population of Liberia prior to the first Census in 1962 was&#13;
only guessed by several researchers. These estimates ranged between 1.6 and&#13;
2.5 million people (Kory, 1970), and their inconsistency with later census&#13;
figures makes them highly dubious for any scientific study of the trend of&#13;
population growth in Liberia. It may be noted that the lowest guess of 1.6&#13;
million was larger than the census count of 1974. The growth of Liberia's&#13;
population as revealed by the censuses is summarized below:&#13;
Census Date                           Total Population (000's)&#13;
April 2, 1962                                           1,016&#13;
February 1, 1974                                        1,503&#13;
Intercensal population growth                           47.8 percent&#13;
Average (geometric) annual rate of&#13;
population growth (1962 - 1974)                     3.4 percent&#13;
The annual geometric rate of population growth (3.4 percent) for&#13;
both the sexes combined as obtained above is very close to that (3.5 percent)&#13;
estimated by the LPGS for 1970. The rate of growth for 1971 as estimated by&#13;
LPGS was heavily affected by high mortality due to a cholera epidemic in that&#13;
year and hence cannot be compared with any average rate over the intercensal&#13;
period. The consistency of the figures obtained from the 2 sources suggests&#13;
that presently the population is growing at an annual rate of about 3.5 per-&#13;
cent.&#13;
Data from the LPGS for the years 1970 and 1971 provide detailed in-&#13;
formation on the level and pattern of fertility and mortality prevailing in&#13;
those years. They suggest that the level of fertility is quite high. The&#13;
crude birth rate is estimated at around 50 per 1000 population per year.&#13;
On average, a Liberian female is expected to bear around 6 children during&#13;
her reproductive lifetime. The estimates of the level of mortality obtained&#13;
by LPGS are not as definitive as those of fertility because of the cholera&#13;
epidemic in 1971 which raised the crude death rate by 6 points above the 1970&#13;
level of 15 per 1000 per year. Since epidemics are not very common in Li-&#13;
beria, the 1971 crude death rate of 21 per 1000 cannot be taken as representa-&#13;
tive. At the same time the 1970-round of the survey may have missed some&#13;
deaths, particularly infant deaths, and the estimated crude death rate of&#13;
15 in 1970 may be lower than the true rate. Here we will assume that an&#13;
average of the crude death rate in the 2 years (18 per 1000) is a realistic&#13;
estimate of the level of mortality.&#13;
The crude birth rate for Liberia, at 50 per 1000 per year, is one&#13;
of the highest in the English-speaking countries of West Africa. Since a&#13;
number of French-speaking countries in West Africa experienced a crude birth&#13;
- L.12 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- L.13 -&#13;
rate higher than that for Liberia, the average for West Africa is close to&#13;
that of Liberia. Also, the crude birth rate for Liberia was slightly higher&#13;
than that for Africa as a whole. On the other hand, the crude death rate&#13;
(about 18 per 1000) was quite low and indicated that Liberia has one of the&#13;
lowest mortality levels among the countries of West Africa. Further, the&#13;
rate for Liberia was similar to that for all of Africa, but about 3 points&#13;
lower than the average for West Africa. Since Liberia has a high crude&#13;
birth rate and a low crude death rate, it has one of the highest rates of&#13;
natural increase (about 3.2 percent per year) among the West African coun-&#13;
tries.&#13;
With a total land area of 97,920 square kilometers (38,250 sq.&#13;
miles) and a total population of 1,016,000 in 1962 and 1,503,000 in 1974,&#13;
the density of population was 10.4 persons per square kilometer in 1962&#13;
and 15.4 persons in 1974. These are relatively low population densities.&#13;
The 1974 figur! is about one-half that of the world as a whole, about 5&#13;
persons per km lower than the average for West Africa, but slightly above&#13;
the average (13) for Africa. Among the English-speaking countries of West&#13;
Africa, Liberia has the lowest density of population. The U.N. medium variant&#13;
estimate for population denlity in 1975 in Sierra Leone, its western neigh-&#13;
bour, was 42 persons per km ; Ghana had a density of 41; and Gambia a density&#13;
of 45 (U.N., 1975).&#13;
The population of Liberia is very unevenly distributed among the&#13;
counties (Table 1). In 1974, nearly 30 percent (29.3 percent) of the entire&#13;
population lived in Montserrado County where the density was slightly more&#13;
than 4 times that of the entire country. The density was about half as great&#13;
in this county in 1962, though it was 3 times the average noted for the whole&#13;
country. While increasing in density, Montserrado also had a gain of 5 points&#13;
in its share of the country's population over the period 1962 - 1974. In&#13;
1974, Montserrado County had the largest share of the country's population of&#13;
any county and experienced the highest density of population. On the other&#13;
extreme, Grand Cape Mount County had the smallest share of the country's pop-&#13;
ulation (3.8 perc~nt) and Grand Gedeh County had the lowest population density&#13;
(4 persons per km ). These 2 counties occupied similar ranks in respect to&#13;
population share and density in 1962 as well. Besides Montserrado, 3 other&#13;
counties had a density of population higher than that of the nation. These&#13;
were Bong, Maryland, and Nimba. Although the counties experienced an increase&#13;
in population density over the period 1962 - 1974, the gains were relatively&#13;
small (1 to 7 persons), except in Montserrado where the density almost doubled&#13;
over the period.&#13;
The intercensal rates of population growth also varied in the dif-&#13;
ferent counties. The average annual intercensal rate of population growth&#13;
for the nation (3.4 percent) was well below the rates for Grand Cape Mount&#13;
(4.9 percent), Montserrado (5.2 percent) and marginally close to those for&#13;
Nimba (3.7 percent) and Grand Gedeh (3.4 percent). This rate ranged from a&#13;
low of 1.4 percent in Grand Bassa County to a high of 5.2 percent in Mont-&#13;
serrado County. One interesting feature in Table 1 is that Maryland County,&#13;
which had the second highest density of population in both censuses, ex-&#13;
perienced one of the lowest (1.6 percent) annual rates of population growth&#13;
over the intercensal period.&#13;

There were more females than males in Liberia in 1962 (sex ratio&#13;
of 98 males per 100 females), but by 1974 males outnumbered females (102:100).&#13;
The sex ratios for 1962 given in Table 1 show that, with the exception of&#13;
Grande Cape Mount and Montserrado Counties, females outnumbered males in the&#13;
various counties. In Grande Cape Mount County the sex ratio was almost even.&#13;
On the other hand, the deficit of females in relation to males in Montserrado&#13;
County was on the order of one-quarter. The large deficit of males in Grand&#13;
Gedeh and Lofa Counties appears to have stemmed from their heavy out-migration&#13;
prior to 1962. The overall deficit of females in the country in 1974 is re-&#13;
flected in their deficit in several counties. Except Montserrado, all the&#13;
counties experienced increases in the sex ratio over the intercensal period.&#13;
The increase varied from 1 point in Nimba County to 11 points in Grand Gedeh.&#13;
In Montserrado, on the other hand, the ratio decreased from 129 in 1962 to 116&#13;
in 1974.&#13;
The spatial distribution of population by sex suggests that at the&#13;
time of both censuses the male and female populations experienced uneven&#13;
and dissimilar distribution over the counties. The dissimilarity in 1962,&#13;
as measured by the index of dissimilarity (Shryock and Siegel, 1973), was&#13;
approximately one and one-half times that in 1974. The respective figures&#13;
were 6.57 and 3.99. Further, the dissimilarity between the spatial distri-&#13;
butions in 1962 and 1974 for males (5.25) was less than that for females&#13;
(7.99). Both these indices indicate internal redistribution of males and&#13;
females during 1962 - 1974, with a greater redistribution occurring among&#13;
females.&#13;
The intercensal growth rate by sex showed that the male popula-&#13;
tion grew at a faster rate (50.7 percent) than the female population (45.1&#13;
percent). The same pattern was noted in all the counties except Montserrado&#13;
where the female population increased at a faster rate. Montserrado experi-&#13;
enced the highest intercensal growth (91.9 percent) among the female popula-&#13;
tion of the various counties, whereas Grand Cape Mount had the highest growth&#13;
(83.1 percent) among the male population. The lowest rate of growth for&#13;
both sexes was noted in Grand Bassa County (23.1 percent for males and 12.6&#13;
percent for females).&#13;
The distribution of total population (both sexes) by broad age&#13;
group indicates that the population (over the intercensal period) became&#13;
younger (Table 2). The share of the total population in the working ages de-&#13;
clined from 58.8 percent in 1962 to 55.4 percent in 1974. The child popula-&#13;
tion increased its share from 37.3 percent to 40.9 percent over the same&#13;
period. This change in the age structure led to an increase in the dependency&#13;
ratio (children aged 0-14 and old people aged 65 and over per 1000 persons&#13;
15-64 years of age) from 700 in 1962 to 805 in 1974.&#13;

Total&#13;
About 199,000 (19.6 percent) of the total population in 1962 were&#13;
living in urban localities (that is, localities with a population of more&#13;
than 2,000), and of these 40.6 percent were living in the Commonwealth Dis-&#13;
trict of Monrovia, the capital city. The percentage of urban population&#13;
increased to 29.1 in 1974. The share of Monrovia in the urban population of&#13;
the country increased to 42.9 percent. The urban population of Liberia more&#13;
than doubled over the intercensal period, from 199,000 in 1962 to 438,000 in&#13;
1974, with an average rate of growth of 6.7 percent per year. This is&#13;
double the rate of growth of the national population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION&#13;
Immigration of aliens to Liberia prior to 1962 was small and pre-&#13;
dominantly male. The first population census conducted in 1962 showed that&#13;
31,633 (3.1 percent of the total population) inhabiting the country were&#13;
born outside Liberia. The figures available from the second census conducted&#13;
12 years later show an upward trend in the number and share of the foreign-&#13;
born population. In 1974 about 59,000 or 4.0 percent of the total enumerated&#13;
population of Liberia were born abroad (Table 3).&#13;

Citizens and Aliens&#13;
Of the total immigrant (foreign-born) population who came to Liberia&#13;
before 1962, one-third were citizens of Liberia. Such immigrants consisted of&#13;
(a) the children of Liberian nationals who were living outside the country at&#13;
the time of birth and (b) immigrants who later became naturalized citizens of&#13;
Liberia. The precise share of each group is not known. However, as indicated&#13;
by a somewhat balanced sex ratio among the immigrant citizens (5,545 males&#13;
and 4,723 females), it appears that the share of the former group must be sub-&#13;
stantial. The slight excess of males among immigrant citizens may be ex-&#13;
plained by the possibility that some male aliens were naturalized after&#13;
marriage to Liberian girls.&#13;
By 1974, the number of citizens born abroad increased by about&#13;
3,000 over the figure of 11,000 in 1962. In spite of an increase in the ab-&#13;
solute number, the share of foreign-born citizens among immigrants declined&#13;
from about one-third in 1962 to about one-fifth (22.2 percent) in 1974.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

In 1962, lifetime alien immigrants in Liberia numbered 21,365 or&#13;
2.1 percent of the total population of the country. Such immigrants recorded&#13;
more than a two-fold increase in their number during 1962-74 to about 46,000&#13;
or 3.0 percent of the total population in 1974. The alien population, how-&#13;
ever, registered an increase from 25,871 in 1962 to 55,660 in 1974 - also&#13;
more than a two-fold increase. A similar trend was shown by the survivors of&#13;
aliens born in Liberia who doubled in number from 4,506 in 1962 to 9,413 in&#13;
1974.&#13;
Country of Origin&#13;
Slightly more than three-fourths of all immigrant citizens came&#13;
from the bordering countries of Guinea, the Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone -&#13;
43.5 percent from Guinea, 25.3 percent from Sierra Leone, and 7.3 percent&#13;
from the Ivory Coast (Table 4). Most of the remainder were from African&#13;
countries, including 13.2 percent from Ghana. Thus, 95 percent of the citizen&#13;
immigrants were African. By contrast, only about 31 percent of immigrant&#13;
aliens came from the bordering countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and the&#13;
Ivory Coast; another 31 percent came from other African countries, with Ghana&#13;
supplying the largest percentage (26) of aliens to Liberia. The aliens who&#13;
came from outside Africa formed a substantial proportion of the total (38&#13;
percent). The United States of America and Lebanon together accounted for&#13;
about 17 percent of the immigrant aliens.&#13;
Movements between Guinea and Liberia appear to constitute the most&#13;
predominant international migration stream affecting Liberia in recent years.&#13;
The data from the LPGS show that in 1970 alone 7,000 persons or 48 percent of&#13;
all immigrants came to Liberia from Guinea (Table 5). At the same time about&#13;
4,000 or 46 percent of all emigrants from Liberia went to Guinea. In 1971,&#13;
the number of immigrants to Liberia from Guinea declined by 50 percent, but&#13;
due to a general decline in the number of immigrants, the share from Guinea&#13;
increased somewhat - from 48 percent in 1970 to 52 percent in 1971. The num-&#13;
ber of emigrants from Liberia to Guinea in 1971 was about the same as in 1970&#13;
but they constituted 61 percent of the total. One noticeable feature of in-&#13;
ternational migration revealed by the LPGS was the shift in intensity of popu-&#13;
lation exchange during 1962-70 between Liberia and its bordering countries&#13;
other than Guinea. By 1970-71 it appeared that Ivory Coast occupied the rank&#13;
previously held by Sierra Leone in 1962 with respect to number of immigrants.&#13;
In 1970 and 1971, about 89 percent of the immigrants came from the bordering&#13;
countries and Ghana, an increase of 16 percentage points from the correspond-&#13;
ing number of lifetime immigrants in 1962.&#13;
Non-African immigrants are underrepresented in the LPGS. However,&#13;
one can tentatively assume that 4 of every 5 immigrants to Liberia came from&#13;
the bordering countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and the Ivory Coast, and&#13;
from Ghana.&#13;

Location of Immigrants&#13;
Both censuses of population provided a distribution of total enum-&#13;
erated population by county/province and of total in-born population enum-&#13;
erated in those areal units. The difference between the 2 numbers for any&#13;
specified county/province gives the number of immigrants located in those&#13;
areal units at the time of the census. The distribution of lifetime immi-&#13;
grants by sex and area of location as obtained in the censuses are given in&#13;
Tables 6 and 7.&#13;
In 1962, (Table 6) about 40 percent of the total lifetime immi-&#13;
grants were residing in Montserrado County where Monrovia is located. Another&#13;
25 percent of the immigrants were living in Central Province where the major&#13;
iron ore mines are located. The western part of the country consisting of&#13;
Grand Cape Mount County and Western Province received about 20 percent of the&#13;
immigrants; while the eastern part of Liberia consisting of Eastern Province,&#13;
Maryland, and Sinoe Counties received a very small share (about 7 percent)&#13;
of total lifetime immigrants.&#13;
The residence pattern of lifetime immigrants at the time of the&#13;
1974 Census appeared slightly different from that in 1962. The areas which&#13;
already had a large share of immigrants in 1962 increased their share during&#13;
the intercensal period. Although the areal units of 1974 are not directly&#13;
comparable to those in 1962, some general idea of the residence pattern is&#13;
revealed by data in Table 7. (The comparability of the areal units in 1962&#13;
and 1974 was described in Chapter I.)&#13;
We can imagine a great population triangle in Liberia with Mont-&#13;
serrado County, the Western, and Central Provinces of 1962 each occupying&#13;
a corner. The same triangle in 1974 consisted of Bong, Lofa, Montserrado,&#13;
and Nimba Counties. In 1962, this triangle contained two-thirds (66.6&#13;
percent) of the total population on 47.9 percent of the total land area. In&#13;
the same year, it contained 78 percent of the total lifetime immigrants to&#13;
the country. In 1974, 70.8 percent of the country's population inhabited&#13;
this great triangle which also accommodated 85 percent of the total lifetime&#13;
immigrants. The heavy concentration of population in this triangle stems&#13;
from the fact that most of the development projects, iron ore mines, etc.,&#13;
are located in this region. The areas on the eastern and western sides of&#13;
the triangle, by and large, have low economic activity and, consequently,&#13;
low population concentration.&#13;
In 1974, about half of the lifetime immigrants were living in&#13;
Montserrado County. Lofa and Nimba Counties each shared about 16 percent&#13;
of the immigrants; and the remaining counties each accommodated less than&#13;
5 percent.&#13;
Intercensal Net - Immigration&#13;
An estimate of the volume of net intercensal immigration may be&#13;
obtained by subtracting the survivors of the lifetime immigrants in 1962 from&#13;

those in 1974. Since immigrants usually experience quite low mortality in&#13;
comparison to the population of the country of residence, if we assume that&#13;
80 percent of the lifetime immigrants in 1962 survived until 1974, it may be&#13;
estimated that Liberia experienced a net intercensal immigration of over&#13;
34,000 persons. This gain, 3.4 percent of the total population in 1962, was&#13;
34 percent more than the survivors of lifetime immigrants from 1962 until 1974&#13;
(25,000).&#13;
Annual Balance of International Migration&#13;
The LPGS provided data on the annual balance of international migra-&#13;
tion for the years 1970 and 1971. The findings presented below, however,&#13;
should be taken cautiously and are subject to the limitations of the data&#13;
discussed earlier. Tables 8 and 9 summarize the annual volume of immigration&#13;
into and emigration from rural and urban areas by sex in 1970 and 1971.&#13;
In 1970 the estimated net immigration into Liberia was 5,684 persons&#13;
or about 4 per 1000 population of the country in that year. Such gains were&#13;
observed in both the rural and urban areas. However, as much as 70 percent&#13;
of the net gain in 1970 was in urban areas. This high concentration of net-&#13;
immigrants in urban areas is due in part to a large emigration from rural&#13;
areas (68 percent of the total number of emigrants). It is interesting to&#13;
note that immigrants do not show any distinct favour for residence in either&#13;
rural or urban areas, as this number in each was about even (54-46 percent)&#13;
in 1970 (Table 8). In spite of this, urban areas experienced a net gain in&#13;
population from immigration greater than that in the rural areas; and the per-&#13;
centage immigrant population in urban areas was higher than in rural areas,&#13;
due mainly to the relative disparity in size between the urban and rural&#13;
populations.&#13;
The volume of international migration, particularly immigration, de-&#13;
creased between 1970 and 1971; and in 1971 Liberia suffered a slight loss of&#13;
0.2 persons per 1000 population. In spite of an overall net-loss, the urban&#13;
areas experienced a net gain of about 2 persons per 1000 population.&#13;

IV. INTERNAL MIGRATION&#13;
This section deals with internal migration in Liberian counties&#13;
and provinces in 1962 and counties in 1974. At the time of the 1974&#13;
Census, as pointed out earlier, the country was divided into 9 counties&#13;
whereas in 1962 it contained 5 counties (all along the coast) and 3 pro-&#13;
vinces (all interior areas). Although the place-of-birth data, the prin-&#13;
cipal source for the present study, provide information regarding counties,&#13;
provinces and territories, we have merged the information on territories&#13;
with that for the counties of which they are a part. This is a consider-&#13;
ation when comparing our findings with those of other studies, for example,&#13;
Siaplay (1973), on internal migration in Liberia.&#13;
Because of administrative boundary changes during the intercensal&#13;
period, it is difficult to compare migration over most of the areal units&#13;
during 1962-74. While it is possible to merge the areas covered in 1962&#13;
and 1974 for comparability, this can be done only where the characteristics&#13;
under study are additive in nature. In the case of internal migration,&#13;
where the migration defining boundaries are those that existed at the&#13;
time of censuses, this type of merging cannot be done and simultaneously&#13;
retain the condition of migration.&#13;
Lifetime Migration&#13;
The 1962 Census enumerated 984,810 person who were born in Liberia.&#13;
Of this number, the place of birth could not be adeqEately classified in&#13;
7,993 (0.81 percent) cases. The study of lifetime migration presented&#13;
here is based on the information regarding place of birth cross-clasified&#13;
by place of enumeration for the remaining 976,817 persons (479,239 males&#13;
and 497,578 females). The analysis of internal migration for 1974 is based on&#13;
similar data for 1,443,910 persons (723,350 males and 720,560 females).&#13;
The volumes of lifetime in-, out-, and net-migration for various&#13;
areal units in 1962 are shown in Table 10. Altogether 165,604 persons&#13;
or 17.0 percent of the total born in Liberia were enumerated outside the&#13;
county/province of their birth. Except for the counties of Montserrado&#13;
and Maryland, all other areal units had net losses. Montserrado experienced&#13;
a lifetime in-migration of 101,331 persons or 61.6 percent of the population&#13;
enumerated in the country. One in every 5 enumerated in Maryland County&#13;
was an in-migrant. The net gain for Maryland was, however, quite small&#13;
(3,064 persons). Grand Bassa County showed the largest net loss of 26,000&#13;
persons, followed by Western Province, with a net loss of about 19,000&#13;
persons.&#13;
Lifetime out-migration as shown by the percent of population born&#13;
in an area (Table 11) shows some variation. Grand Bassa, Grand Cape Mount,&#13;
and Sinoe Counties along with Eastern Province each lost between 20 to&#13;
23 percent of their total population. The lowest out-migration rate is&#13;
noted in the case of Central Province, closely followed by Montserrado&#13;

and Maryland Counties. These three areal units experienced out-migration&#13;
within a narrow range of 12.9 to 14.6 percent of the inborn population&#13;
(Table 11). There is some indication (rank correlation coefficient -0.2)&#13;
that areal units which experienced high lifetime out-migration had a&#13;
tendency to experience low lifetime in-migration.&#13;
By 1974, the pattern of lifetime internal migration appeared to&#13;
have changed somewhat. The numerical values as of 1962 and 1974 are not&#13;
directly comparable. However, the data indicate an increasing tendency&#13;
toward the incidence of lifetime internal migration over the intercensal&#13;
period. According to the areal units of 1974, 21 percent of the total&#13;
population born in Liberia were enumerated outside their county of birth,&#13;
or about 4 percentage points more than that obtained for the areal units&#13;
of 1962. The 1974 figure of 21 percent is even .higher than the value&#13;
obtained by Siaplay (1973), who noted that 18.4 percent of the population&#13;
born in Liberia were enumerated outside their county/province/territory&#13;
of birth in 1962. Siaplay considered territories in addition to counties&#13;
and provinces, and this increase in the number of areal units occasioned&#13;
a slightly higher value for the incidence of internal migration compared&#13;
to our finding.&#13;
The volumes of lifetime in-, out-, and net-migration as of 1974&#13;
given in Table 12 show that Montserrado was the only county which recorded&#13;
a net gain (200,967). The remaining counties experienced net losses.&#13;
Comparison of Tables 10 and 12 reveals a general rise in the incidence&#13;
of out- as well as in-migration. The number of lifetime migrants increased&#13;
from 165,604 in 1962 to 302,961 in 1974. This growth of 83 percent was&#13;
considerably higher than the growth of the total population born in Liberia&#13;
(46.6 percent). Table 12 shows that Lofa had the highest net loss (53,000),&#13;
followed by Grand Bassa (40,000), and Bong (36,000). Grand Cape Mount had&#13;
the lowest net loss (about 4,000).&#13;
By 1974, Sinoe County had lost about 30 percent of its population&#13;
to other counties (Table 13). This was the highest out-migration rate&#13;
of any county. Bong, Grand Bassa, Grand Cape Mount, Maryland, and Lofa&#13;
lost between 25 - 28 percent of their inborn population. Montserrado&#13;
was the only county which had a small loss of population (6 percent).&#13;
Only 2 counties appear to have received substantial in-migration in&#13;
relation to restdent population (Table 13). Montserrado experienced the&#13;
highest in-migration rate (about 52 percent), followed by Grand Cape&#13;
Mount (22.5 percent). In-migration to other counties stood at 11 percent&#13;
or less. The lowest in-migration rate (5 percent) was experienced by&#13;
Sinoe County which also had the highest out-migration rate.&#13;
Migration Streams&#13;
The net gains due to exchange of population (both sexes) between&#13;
the areal units of 1962 (Table 14) show 3 dominant streams to Montserrado&#13;
County. The strongest stream of 27,000 persons (24.5 percent of the total&#13;
net gain) came from Central Province. This was followed by streams from&#13;

Grand Bassa County and Western Province of about 24,000 and 21,000 persons&#13;
respectively. These 3 major net migration streams accounted for nearly 65&#13;
percent of the total net gain of various areas in 1962. Montserrado County&#13;
was the universal gainer and accounted for 82 percent of the total net gain&#13;
experienced by the various areal units. The other 2 net streams of inter-&#13;
mediate importance were from Sinoe to Montserrado (8,000 persons) and from&#13;
Eastern Province to Maryland (7,000 persons). Eastern Province had a net&#13;
loss to each areal unit except Grand Bassa whereas Sinoe had net losses to&#13;
each areal unit except Eastern Province. Grand Bassa County had a net loss&#13;
to every areal unit except Sinoe County. (See Map 2.).&#13;
Montserrado (Table 15) continued to be the universal net gainer&#13;
as a result of population exchange between the counties. By 1974 the&#13;
net gain to this county had increased to about 201,000 persons or 88 percent&#13;
of the total net gain of the various counties. The predominant net streams&#13;
to Montserrado came from Lofa (44,000), Grand Bassa (41,000) and Bong&#13;
(40,000). These streams reflect the continuation of the predominant&#13;
net migration streams observed at the time of the first census in 1962.&#13;
To compare the 2 sets of streams it may be recalled that Lofa and Bong&#13;
counties were carved out of Western and Central Provinces, respectively.&#13;
Nimba was the other county carved out of Central Province. If we include&#13;
the net stream from Nimba (20,000 persons) to Montserrado with that from&#13;
Bong to Montserrado, the replication of the 1962 pattern of migration&#13;
streams in 1974 is apparent, at an increased intensity. Two other streams&#13;
originate from Maryland and Sinoe to Montserrado with respective net gains&#13;
of 18,000 and 20,000. Besides Montserrado, 2 other counties attracted&#13;
migration streams, Grand Cape Mount and Nimba. Grand Cape Mount was second&#13;
only to Montserrado in net gain, followed by Nimba County. In spite of these&#13;
migration patterns, both Grand Cape Mount and Nimba, on the whole, experi-&#13;
enced a total net loss of population because of heavy out-migration to&#13;
Montserrado. Lofa had the heaviest net loss of population (53,000 persons),&#13;
followed by Grand Bassa (44,000), and Bong (43,000). The net losses of&#13;
these 3 counties accounted for 61 percent of the total net loss by all&#13;
counties.&#13;
Grand Cape Mount had the smallest net loss in both 1962 and&#13;
1974. The smallest total gain (67 persons) was experienced by Eastern&#13;
Province in 1962 (Table 14) and Grand Gedeh County in 1974 (180 persons)&#13;
(Table 15). Since Grand Gedeh County was carved out of Eastern Province, it&#13;
appears that practically the same area had the lowest gain in population as&#13;
a result of internal redistribution in the 2 census years. (See Map 3.)&#13;
Destination of Out-Migrants&#13;
In 1962, the census enumerated about 166,000 persons outside their&#13;
county/province of birth. Of these, 101,000 (61.2 percent) were located in&#13;
Montserrado County. Thus, 6 out of every 10 lifetime out-migrants in 1962&#13;
were living in Montserrado. In 1974 there were 303,000 persons born in&#13;
Liberia enumerated outside their county of birth. Of these, 214,000 (70.6&#13;
percent) were found in Montserrado County. Over the intercensal period, the&#13;
share of out-migrants coming to Montserrado increased by nearly 10 percentage&#13;
points. The absolute numbers more than doubled, however.&#13;

On average, about 3 of every 4 who moved out of Grand Bassa&#13;
County, Central and Western Provinces went to Montserrado (Table 16). Each&#13;
of these areal units were in the neighborhood of Montserrado. It is surpris-&#13;
ing that Grand Cape Mount another neighbouring county, sent only one-half of&#13;
its out-migrants to Montserrado. Maryland and Sinoe Counties sent about 6 of&#13;
every 10 out-migrants to Montserrado, whereas the Eastern Province sent only&#13;
16 percent of its out-migrants there. By 1974, the intensity of migration&#13;
from various counties to Montserrado increased. There was a distinct shift in&#13;
the direction of movement of out-migrants from Grand Cape Mount, where almost&#13;
80 percent (an increase of 27 percent over 1962) went to Montserrado. There&#13;
was also increased out-migration from Grand Gedeh County (formerly a part of&#13;
the Eastern Province) to Montserrado.&#13;
In general, most out-migrants from the counties moved into neigh-&#13;
bouring areas. The low incidence of out-migration to neighbouring counties&#13;
from areal units not sharing a common border with Montserrado County was&#13;
noticeable in both census years (particularly in the cases of Maryland&#13;
and Sinoe Counties in 1962, and Grand Gedeh and Nimba Counties in 1974).&#13;
However, all counties showing low out-migration to neighbouring areas,&#13;
simultaneously showed high out-migration to Montserrado. Thus, availability&#13;
of economic and other opportunities in Montserrado appear to out-weight&#13;
the factor of distance.&#13;
Net Internal Migration. 1962 - 1974&#13;
Because of extensive boundary changes during the intercensal&#13;
period, data on place of birth cross-classified by place of enumeration are&#13;
of little use for the study of intercensal migration between the areal&#13;
units. However, we obtained an indirect estimate of net intercensal migra-&#13;
tion by the national growth rate method (Shryock and Siegel, 1973), after&#13;
adjusting the spatial distribution of the enumerated population in 1962 for&#13;
immigration.&#13;
The spatial distribution of the population born in Liberia and&#13;
enumerated in 1974 was used as provided in the unpublished data giving place&#13;
of birth cross-classified by place of enumeration. Comparative distribution&#13;
for 1962 was estimated as shown in Table 17. Grand Bassa, Grand Cape Mount,&#13;
and Sinoe Counties did not experience boundary changes and therefore the&#13;
numbers of immigrants living in these counties in 1962 were not adjusted.&#13;
In the other counties, the immigrants were distributed among different areas&#13;
according to the proportion the 1962 enumerated population of that area was&#13;
to the total population of the county or province. No adjustment was&#13;
possible for emigration.&#13;
Assuming fertility and mortality conditions in each county during&#13;
the intercensal period were similar to those of the nation, the number&#13;
of natives born and enumerated in the various counties in 1962 (Table&#13;
17) would have the same growth rate as the national population. Thus,&#13;
using the national growth rate for the period 1962 - 1974 for the population&#13;
born in Liberia by sex, the expected population of various counties in&#13;

1974 was obtained. The difference between the enumerated and the expected&#13;
sizes of the population in each county provides an estimate of the net&#13;
internal migration experienced by that county over the intercensal period&#13;
(Table 18). A positive difference indicates net gain.&#13;
During the intercensal period 4 counties, (Grand Cape Mount,&#13;
Grand Gedeh, Montserrado, and Nimba) experienced net gains of males and&#13;
total population. Of these, only 3 counties (Grand Gedeh was the exception)&#13;
registered a net gain of female population. The highest net gain (75,000)&#13;
was by Montserrado. Grand Cape Mount and Nimba counties experienced net&#13;
gains of about 9,000 and 7,000 respectively. The net gain for Grand Gedeh&#13;
was negligible (815 persons). Grand Bassa county having a common boundary&#13;
with Montserrado had the greatest net loss (35,000), followed by Maryland (a&#13;
net loss of about 19,000). The counties which suffered net losses of both&#13;
sexes also experienced higher losses of female population. By contrast, the&#13;
"inet gaining" counties of Montserrado and Nimba gained more females than&#13;
males.&#13;
The intercensal net migration rates given in Table 19 show high&#13;
net gains for Montserrado (23.4 percent) and Grand Cape Mount (21.5 per-&#13;
cent). These 2 counties, however, show opposite patterns of relative gain&#13;
in respect to male and female population. The rates conform to the patterns&#13;
shown in volumes of net gain and loss.&#13;
Rural - Urban Migration&#13;
The study of rural-urban migration presented here is based on&#13;
adjusted data (as explained in Chapter I) obtained from the LPGS for the&#13;
years 1970 and 1971. To minimise fluctuations and improve reliability,&#13;
we will mainly consider average figures for the 2 years. In addition,&#13;
the distribution of population in urban and rural areas as obtained from&#13;
the two censuses of Liberia will be discussed briefly.&#13;
At the time of the 1962 census about 199,000 persons (20 percent&#13;
of the total population) were living in urban localities (defined as&#13;
localities with a population of 2,000 or more persons). As noted in&#13;
Chapter II, about 438,000 (29 percent of the total population) persons were&#13;
living in urban localities in 1974. Assuming the urban population of&#13;
Liberia increased at the same rate as the national population, it is esti-&#13;
mated that the urban populatibn would have reached a level of 294,000 by&#13;
1974 as a result of natural increase. Thus, the estimated 144,000 extra&#13;
people in urban areas would result from migration and/or reclassification of&#13;
areas. This addition to the urban population accounted for 60 percent of&#13;
the total change in urban population during 1962-1974. Also, this was about&#13;
12 perceht of the average population of Liberia during 1962-1974.&#13;
Most of the rural-urban migration was directed toward Monrovia,&#13;
the national capital, and the other major centers of economic activity.&#13;
The population of Monrovia and its environs increased rapidly after 1956&#13;
when its population was 41,000 (Liberia, 1956). Later, the population&#13;

of Monrovia including Gardners Vill and Paynesward (Greater Monrovia)&#13;
increased from 84,000 in 1962 to 204,000 in 1974, with an increase of&#13;
120,000 persons over a period of 12 years. If the population of Greater&#13;
Monrovia increased at the same rate as the national population, it would&#13;
have attained a size of 124,000 by 1974. Thus, it may be estimated that&#13;
during 1962 - 1974, about 80,000 migrants moved into Monrovia. Due to a&#13;
lack of data, it is difficult to quantify the contribution of internal&#13;
migration and immigration to this population growth; however, some approxi-&#13;
mations are possible. At the time of the 1962 Census about 12,000 immigrants&#13;
were living in Montserrado, including Marshall Territory. About 26,000&#13;
immigrants were living in the same area at the time of 1974 Census. If we&#13;
assume that all the immigrants in Montserrado County were located in Mon-&#13;
rovia, the immigration could have contributed (at most) about 14,000 people&#13;
toward the growth of the population. Thus, it may be estimated that internal&#13;
migration contributed about 66,000 persons toward the growth of Monrovia's&#13;
population. Using relevant information from LPGS, this contribution can be&#13;
partitioned into migration from rural and other areas. It has been observed&#13;
in LPGS that of the total in-migration to urban areas, about 63 percent came&#13;
from rural areas and the remainder from other urban areas. Using this&#13;
factor, it may be estimated that Monrovia gained (net) about 41,000 (66,000&#13;
X 0.63) persons as a result of population exchange with rural areas. This&#13;
net migration from the rural areas into Monrovia is about 28 percent of the&#13;
total estimated net gain to urban areas (144,000) in Liberia during 1962 -&#13;
1974.&#13;
Rural - Urban Migration Turnover&#13;
The data from LPGS provide an extremely exaggerated picture of&#13;
rural-urban migration because all persons who came from another place and&#13;
were living at the place of enumeration for at least 30 days were counted&#13;
as migrants. Thus, the rural-urban migration considered here includes&#13;
temporary as well as permanent migration. Further, the out-migration&#13;
approach of collecting data by its nature is likely to underestimate&#13;
migration flows. We will, therefore, use the data collected through the&#13;
in-migration approach, though for comparative purposes all tables contain&#13;
both sets of data.&#13;
Rural-urban migration turnover is fairly high in Liberia. During&#13;
1970 - 1971, about 384,000 (25 percent of the total population) persons&#13;
changed residence. Of these, 117,000 moved within rural areas and 87,000&#13;
moved within urban areas. Rural-to-urban and urban-to-rural mobility&#13;
amounted to 148,000 and 32,000 persons respectively (Table 20). Of the&#13;
4 components of rural-urban migration, the flow from rural-to-urban areas&#13;
was the strongest, whereas the flow in the reverse direction was the&#13;
weakest. Of those who left rural areas, about 56 percent moved into urban&#13;
areas; whereas of those who left urban areas, only about 27 percent went&#13;
to rural areas. These gross flows suggest that at the time people leave&#13;
rural areas, they show a preference for urban areas; and when they leave&#13;
urban areas, they demonstrate a preference for urban areas. It is possible&#13;
that in the first instance rural people move to small urban areas and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

later to big ones. Of the total average rural population during 1970/1971&#13;
(1,130,000) about 23.5 percent participated in either intra-rural (10.5&#13;
percent) or rural-to-urban (13 percent) movements. By comparison it is&#13;
noted that 28.5 percent of the urban population (417,000) in 1970-1971&#13;
moved to either another urban center (21 percent) or rural areas (7.5&#13;
percent). These area-specific gross migration flows suggest heavy rural-&#13;
to-urban and urban-to-urban migration. The intra-urban mobility rate&#13;
is almost double the intra-rural mobility rate. A similar pattern is&#13;
shown in rural-to-urban and urban-to-rural mobility rates (Table 20). Of&#13;
the total population in 1970-1971, about 12 percent were involved in rural-&#13;
urban migration turnover.&#13;
Net Rural - Urban Migration&#13;
As a result of rural-urban migration, the urban areas experienced&#13;
an estimated net gain of 117,000 persons per year during 1970 - 1971&#13;
(Table 20). This was about 7.5 percent of the total population during&#13;
the same period. This net gain of over 100,000 persons per year to urban&#13;
areas with a total national population of 1,503,000 is apparently very&#13;
much exaggerated. Since data on duration of past residence are not avail-&#13;
able, it is impossible to disentangle the effect of temporary migration on&#13;
the total. However, it was noted in the LPGS Report (M-1, M-2) that monthly&#13;
rounds of enumeration spotted more migration than six-monthly rounds.&#13;
This indicated that the estimated volume of rural-urban migration is&#13;
heavily affected by temporary migration. It is extremely doubtful that&#13;
the urban centers of Liberia with a population of 438,000 in 1974 could&#13;
absorb a net annual in-flow of more than 100,000 persons. Net gains to&#13;
urban areas as obtained from the LPGS for 1970 and 1971 were respectively&#13;
118,000 and 116,000 persons. During 1962-1974, the urban areas of Liberia&#13;
experienced a net gain of only 144,000 persons as a result of migration&#13;
(both international and internal) and reclassification of areas. While&#13;
data collected in the census concerning lifetime migration are not directly&#13;
comparable to those collected in the LPGS concerning the incidence of&#13;
migration, they do provide a basis for checking the consistency of the&#13;
results. The difference between the figures obtained from the 2 sources&#13;
suggests the temporary nature of much of the rural-urban migration. It is&#13;
possible that people move from one area to another with the intention&#13;
of a long duration residence (described later in this report), but do&#13;
not remain and move to another area, thus inflating the incidence of&#13;
migration. This may indeed occur because reasons for most migrations appear&#13;
to be unspecific (described later).&#13;

V. SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF MIGRANTS&#13;
Sex Composition&#13;
International Migration:&#13;
Among the foreign-born population enumerated in 1962, the number of&#13;
males (19,591) exceeded females (12,042) by 60 percent; there were 163 males&#13;
for every 100 females. By 1974, the ratio of males to females was somewhat&#13;
reduced because of the growing number of female immigrants over the inter-&#13;
censal period. While the number of male immigrants increased by 82.5 percent&#13;
to 35,759 in 1974, the number of female immigrants increased to 23,699 -- an&#13;
increase of 96.8 percent over the 1962 level.&#13;
The sex composition of citizen immigrants was different from that&#13;
of alien immigrants. Though both groups demonstrated the same pattern&#13;
-- numerical predominance of males -- citizen immigrants had a somewhat&#13;
more balanced sex ratio than alien immigrants. Among lifetime citizen&#13;
immigrants, the ratios of males to females were 117 to 100 in 1962 and 135&#13;
to 100 in 1974. Among lifetime alien immigrants, in 1962 and 1974 the ratios&#13;
of males to females were 203 to 100 and 156 to 100 respectively.&#13;
The numerical predominance of males in international migration&#13;
is further evidenced by data from the LPGS. International migration into&#13;
and from Liberia, with the negligible exception of emigrants from urban&#13;
areas in 1971, appeared male dominated in these surveys. Table 8 showed&#13;
that of the total immigrants in 1970, 60.4 percent were male, and in 1971&#13;
62.2 percent. Of those emigrating in 1970 and 1971, 53.0 and 53.4 percent&#13;
respectively were male. Table 8 also showed that relatively more female&#13;
than male immigrants went to urban areas. In 1970, 50.3 percent of female&#13;
immigrants were located in urban areas, but only 43.3 percent of male&#13;
immigrants. In 1971, the corresponding percentages were 53.3 and 45.3.&#13;
Table 9 indicated that the net loss due to international migration was&#13;
confined mainly to females from rural areas.&#13;
Internal Migration:&#13;
Internal migration in Liberia, like international migration, has&#13;
been predominantly male. In 1962, lifetime male in-migrants outnumbered&#13;
female in-migrants by a ratio of 3 to 2 (Table 21); and (excepting Grand&#13;
Cape Mount County) the areal units which had the heaviest overall in-&#13;
migration also had a greater number of males among in-migrants. The sex&#13;
ratio for in-migrants in 1962 varied between 116 in Grand Bassa County&#13;
to 221 in Grand Cape Mount County. The range of variation is reduced&#13;
considerably if the very high value for Grand Cape Mount is ignored.&#13;
The next highest sex ratio is noted in Montserrado which received 154&#13;
males for every 100 females. The sex ratios for in-migrants and out-&#13;
migrants in 1962 showed a different pattern of migration by sex. Among the&#13;
out-migrants from various areal units in 1962, the excess of males per 100&#13;
females varied from a low of 12 in Sinoe to a high of 90 in Western Province.&#13;

Out-migration from the interior provinces is more predominantly male than&#13;
in-migration to these areas (Table 21). The pattern is less intense for&#13;
coastal counties; out-migration from these counties, although mostly male,&#13;
shows less male dominance than from the interior provinces.&#13;
By 1974, it appeared that the numerical dominance of males in&#13;
internal migration had decreased; there were about 129 males for every 100&#13;
females. The decline in the sex ratio during the intercensal period was&#13;
about 20 points. The excess of males among lifetime in-migrants to various&#13;
counties in 1974 varied from 19 in Grand Gedeh to 54 in Grand Cape Mount.&#13;
Montserrado County received only 26 males in excess of every 100 females.&#13;
The most unbalanced in-migration by sex occurred in Lofa and Grand Cape&#13;
Mount Counties. Lofa County also experienced an equally unbalanced out-&#13;
migration by sex. This shift in the sex ratios indicates that from 1962 -&#13;
1974, the internal migration of females increased more than that of males.&#13;
This is substantiated by indirect estimates of the volume of internal&#13;
migration experienced by the different counties during 1962-1974. With the&#13;
exception of Grand Cape Mount and Grand Gedeh Counties, all counties had a&#13;
net gain of more females than males.&#13;
Rural-Urban Migration:&#13;
Data from the LPGS for 1970 and 1971 suggest a balanced rural-&#13;
urban migration by both sexes. The number of males per 100 females during&#13;
1970 - 1971 for the three migration streams (rural to rural, rural to urban,&#13;
and urban to rural), varied within a narrow range of 101 to 105. The&#13;
sex ratio of intra-urban migration was slightly higher at 114.&#13;
Age Structure&#13;
International Migration:&#13;
About three-fourths of the foreign-born population were in the&#13;
economically active age group of 15-59 years (Table 22). On average,&#13;
the immigrant male population was about 4 years older than the immigrant&#13;
female population. Forty-seven percent of the male immigrants were under&#13;
30 years of age, while 59 percent of female immigrants were under 30.&#13;
On average, one in 5 of the foreign-born population was in the age group&#13;
0-14 years. The sex ratios of the foreign-born in the age groups 0-14,&#13;
15-29, 30-44, 45-59 and 60+ years were 110, 146, 196, 255 and 198 respec-&#13;
tively. The first four 15-year age groups exhibited an increasing sex ratio&#13;
with advancing age. Recent migrants include a relatively higher proportion&#13;
of females than earlier migrants. The age and sex distributions of the&#13;
alien population show patterns similar to those demonstrated by the foreign-&#13;
born population with the exception of the age group 0-14 years. Table 22&#13;
showed that one-quarter of all aliens were in the age group 0-14 years as&#13;
compared to 18 percent of foreign-born immigrants. The sex ratios for aliens&#13;
in the age groups 0-14, 15-29, 30-44, 45-59 and 60+ years were 110, 164,&#13;
228, 299 and 212, respectively. Compared to the foreign-born immigrants,&#13;
the sex ratio of aliens in each age groups is higher. A nearly balanced sex&#13;

Liberia, both citizens and aliens.&#13;
By 1974, the age distribution of the foregin-born population&#13;
had changed somewhat. First, the male and female immigrants in 1974 were&#13;
younger respectively than their counterparts in 1962. The median ages for&#13;
males and females changed respectively from 31.0 and 26.9 years in 1962 to&#13;
29.8 and 24.0 years in 1974. Second, on average, in 1974 the immigrant male&#13;
population was about 6 years older than the immigrant female population;&#13;
though in this year, like in 1962, three-fourths of all immigrants were in&#13;
the economically-active age group of 15-59 years.&#13;
The sex structure of the alien population in 1974 was very similar&#13;
to that of the foreign-born population in the same year. The sex ratios of&#13;
the alien population in the age groups 0-14, 15-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+&#13;
years were 104, 120, 233, 284, and 273 respectively, and illustrate this&#13;
feature. However, the age structures of the two groups of populations were&#13;
somewhat different. Male and female aliens were younger respectively than&#13;
the foreign-born. The median age for male aliens in 1974 was 28.0 years,&#13;
about 2 years lower than that among foreign-born males. In the case of&#13;
female aliens, the median age of 21.6 years was also about 2 years lower&#13;
than that among foreign-born females.&#13;
The LPGS provided a distribution of immigrants and emigrants by age,&#13;
sex, and location in the years 1970 and 1971 (Table 23). Table 24 distributes&#13;
net immigrants by age, sex, and location. The selected partition values for&#13;
the age distributions of immigrants and emigrants are given in Table 25.&#13;
Most immigrants (more than 90 percent) were below 45 years of age.&#13;
By and large, male immigrants were older than female immigrants. In both&#13;
years, the median ages of male immigrants were about 6 years older than&#13;
female immigrants. The age differences were somewhat greater in the case&#13;
of immigrants to rural areas (about 7 years) than those to urban areas&#13;
(4-5 years). The differences in median ages of immigrants by sex stems&#13;
from a large concentration of female immigrants in the younger age groups.&#13;
Of all female immigrants in 1970, 33.8 percent were in the age group 0-14&#13;
years. The comparative percentage in 1971 was 29.4. By contrast, only 20.1&#13;
percent of all immigrants in 1970 were in the age group 0-14 years, and in&#13;
1971 the percentage was even lower, at 12. In 1970, the percentages&#13;
of female immigrants in the age groups 15-29, 30-44 and 45+ years were&#13;
lower than the corresponding percentages for male immigrants. This pattern&#13;
was not as distinct in 1971, where differences between the distributions&#13;
were quite irregular. The first and third quartiles given in Table 25&#13;
indicate that the central one-half of male immigrants to rural areas were&#13;
concentrated within a narrow range of 13 years from 19.4 to 32.4 years. In&#13;
the case of female immigrants to rural areas, this range was slightly wider&#13;
(18.3 years, from 8.0 to 26.3). In urban areas, one-half of the immigrants&#13;
in 1970 were concentrated in a range of about 21 years (males aged from 14.0&#13;
to 35.6, and females from 8.9 to 30.0 years). In 1971, the inter-quartile&#13;
range was somewhat narrower (males aged 19.7 to 34.5 years, and females from&#13;
11.0 to 28.0 years).&#13;

With the exception of female emigrants from rural areas in 1970,&#13;
emigrants were younger than immigrants of the same sex in any specified&#13;
location. The median ages of female emigrants in urban areas in both&#13;
years were similar to those of female immigrants in urban areas, with&#13;
the actual values around 21-22 years. The widest difference between the&#13;
median ages of emigrants and immigrants were noted in rural areas, varying&#13;
between 3.1 years in 1970 to 11.5 years in 1971. The age distribution&#13;
of emigrants exhibited a greater variability than that of immigrants.&#13;
Immigrants from neighbouring countries, in general, have been&#13;
slightly older than the emigrants to these countries (Table 26). Median&#13;
ages of immigrants from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the Ivory Coast in 1970&#13;
and 1971 varied between 20-27 years, whereas the median ages of emigrants&#13;
to these countries ranged between 10-23 years. The semi-inter-quartile range&#13;
for the age distribution of immigrants from each of the neighbouring countries&#13;
was narrower than that for emigrants to the respective countries; most immi-&#13;
grants from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the Ivory Coast were aged 15 and over.&#13;
However, the relevant percentages for immigrants specified in Table 26 show&#13;
a considerable variation over the 2 years of observation.&#13;
Internal Migration:&#13;
The 2 censuses provided data concerning the age and sex of internal&#13;
migrants. The broad age groups employed in the 2 censuses were, however, dif-&#13;
ferent. The data for 1962 are available by the ages less than 15, 15-29,&#13;
30-44 and 45+ years; whereas those for 1974 are given as less than 15, 15-24,&#13;
25-34, 35-44 and 45+ years. These data have been used to calculate the age-&#13;
specific lifetime out- and net-migration rates for males and females (Tables&#13;
27-30).&#13;
Young adults, both male and female, in the age group 15-29 years&#13;
numerically dominated the migrants (Table 27). This pattern was noted among&#13;
migrants from each areal unit in 1962, except for Montserrado. This is a&#13;
plausible concentration due to the opportunities in this county. One in&#13;
every 3 males aged 15-29 years in 1962 was an out-migrant. Males in the age&#13;
group 30-44 years had a 28 percent out-migration rate. The out-migration&#13;
rates for females, though concentrated in the same two age groups as males,&#13;
are generally lower. The out-migration rate for males in the age group 15-29&#13;
years varied from 18 percent in Montserrado to 44 percent in Eastern Province.&#13;
Among females, the variation was from 12 percent in Central Province to 29&#13;
percent in Grand Cape Mount. Generally, out-migration rates for children&#13;
(below 15 years of age) were the lowest of all age groups.&#13;
The age pattern of lifetime out-migration in 1974 (Table 29) broadly&#13;
agrees with that of 1962. However, the age groupings employed in 1974 bring&#13;
out certain differences which were probably concealed by the classification&#13;
of the 1962 migration data. In general, there was a rise in the incidence of&#13;
lifetime migration during the period 1962 - 1974. The highest out-migration&#13;
rates for males were noted in the age group 25-34 years; while females, from&#13;
most of the counties, were in the age group 15-24 years. This highlights a&#13;

difference in the age pattern of migration for males and females; female&#13;
migrants were slightly younger than male migrants. In addition, in compari-&#13;
son to 1962, the 1974 lifetime out-migration rates for females in the age&#13;
groups under 15 and over 45 appeared to exchange places, so that there was&#13;
an increase in the out-migration of young women and a decrease among older&#13;
women.&#13;
The age specific lifetime net-migration rates for 1962 and 1974 are&#13;
given in Tables 28 and 29. The net migration rates by age and sex for Mont-&#13;
serrado in 1962 reflect the age-pattern of out-migration rates for other areal&#13;
units given in Table 27. The age groups in descending order of magnitude of&#13;
age-specific net migration for each sex were 15-29, 30-44, 45 and over, and&#13;
under 15 years. The age-specific net migration rates for Maryland, another&#13;
net in-migrating county in 1962, did not show any regularity. For the net&#13;
out-migrating areal units, the age-specific net rates in the age groups 15-29&#13;
and 30-44 follow a pattern similar to that shown in the age-specific out-&#13;
migration rates for these age groups. The extreme age groups do not exhibit&#13;
any consistent pattern.&#13;
The age-specific net migration rates in Table 30 for lifetime mi-&#13;
gration in 1974 closely conform to the 1962 pattern. One important excep-&#13;
tion concerned female net in-migrants to Montserrado; in general, in 1974&#13;
females from net out-migrating counties in the age group 15-24 years were&#13;
more migratory than those aged 25-34. The reverse was true in Montserrado.&#13;
The age pattern of sex ratios (Tables 31 and 32) demonstrates that&#13;
female internal lifetime migrants (whether in- or out-) are mainly concen-&#13;
trated in the younger age groups. In 1962, the ratios in the 2 younger age&#13;
groups, 0-14 and 15-29 years, are lower than those in the older age groups.&#13;
By 1974, no great change was noted in the age pattern of sex ratios&#13;
for in- and out-migrants, even though different age groupings were employed&#13;
in 1974. Table 32 shows more female than male migrants were concentrated in&#13;
the younger age groups, particularly 15-24. With advancing age, the excess&#13;
of males over females increased.&#13;
Rural-Urban Migration:&#13;
The age distribution of migrants by type of migration (rural to&#13;
rural, rural to urban, urban to rural, and urban to urban) does not show any&#13;
marked departure from that of the total population (Table 33). These data&#13;
from the LPGS suggest that age has very little effect on rural-urban&#13;
migration. The age distributions of male and female migrants in each stream&#13;
are almost similar. The similarity as measured by median age is quite pre-&#13;
valent in the cases of rural to rural (median ages about 21 years) and urban&#13;
to rural (median ages about 19 years) migration. In the other 2 streams bound&#13;
to urban areas, male migrants are on average about 2 years older than female&#13;
migrants. The similarity of the age distributions of migrants as compared to&#13;
the population of the respective areas strongly suggests that most migra-&#13;
tions are family migrations, and a high proportion of them visitors, and not&#13;
migrants at all.&#13;

Sex, age, and location-specific migration rates (Tables 34 and 35)&#13;
indicate the pattern of migration by type. The incidence of migration from&#13;
rural-to-urban areas is highest in the age group 15-29 years. The rates are&#13;
25.3 percent for males and 18.6 percent for females. The next highest inci-&#13;
dence of male migration from rural-to-urban locations occurs in the age group&#13;
30-44 years (20 percent), whereas the same rank for female migrants occurs&#13;
over the age group 0-14 years (12 percent). The difference between the- age-&#13;
specific rural-to-urban migration rates by sex is reflected in the higher&#13;
median age for male than female migrants.&#13;
Urban-to-rural movement (Table 34) does not show any marked age&#13;
differential.&#13;
The age pattern of intra-urban migration for each sex is very&#13;
similar to that of rural-to-urban migration (Tables 34 and 35). The rates&#13;
in each age group of the former stream are, however, invariably higher than&#13;
those for the latter. This indicates that a rural-to-urban migrant has a&#13;
high probability of moving again to another urban area.&#13;
Intra-rural mobility does not show any marked age differential&#13;
(Table 35), as noted previously for urban-to-rural migration. However, the&#13;
age-specific rates for the former are higher than those for the latter.&#13;
Age-specific turnover and net rural-to-urban migration rates are&#13;
highest in the age group 15-29 years. The respective values are 18 and 12&#13;
percents. Both turnover and net age-specific migration rates (Table 36)&#13;
follow the same pattern as rural-to-urban migration (Table 34). The lowest&#13;
rates are observed in the age group 60+ years.&#13;
Age-Effectiveness of Rural-Urban Migration:&#13;
The index of effectiveness (United Nations, 1970) for rural-urban&#13;
migration by age and sex as calculated from LPGS data are given in Table 37.&#13;
Rural-urban migration is equally effective (at about 65 percent) in trans-&#13;
ferring the male and female populations from rural to urban areas. Further,&#13;
the age-pattern of effectiveness of rural-urban migration for males and&#13;
females is almost identical. The migration of males has the highest effec-&#13;
tiveness, at 72 percent, in the age group 30-44 years, followed by the age&#13;
group 15-29 years at 68 percent effectiveness. In the case of female mi-&#13;
grants, the most effective age group in transferring the population is 15-29&#13;
years, with an index of 68 percent. This is closely followed by the age&#13;
groups on either side, each with an effectiveness of 64 percent.&#13;
Population Redistribution and the Efficiency of Internal Migration&#13;
The volume of displaced persons in 1962 may be obtained by adding&#13;
the positive (or negative) differences under the column headed "Net" in Table&#13;
10. There were 58,045 males and 36,414 females who were displaced on a life-&#13;
time basis in 1962. Relating these figures to respective population totals,&#13;
12.1 percent of males and 7.3 percent of females were displaced in that year.&#13;

The displacement rate for both sexes was 9.7 percent. A similar analysis of&#13;
data in Table 12 indicates that in 1974 there were 112,223 males, or 15.5&#13;
percent of all in-born males, displaced from their place of birth. Twelve&#13;
percent of all in-born females were similarly displaced. Thus, 200,967&#13;
persons -- or 14 percent of the population -- would have to be redistributed&#13;
in order to obtain a distribution identical to place of birth in 1974.&#13;
Though the areal units in 1962 and 1974 are not directly comparable, the&#13;
displacement index for the total population increased from 9.7 percent in&#13;
1962 to 13.9 percent in 1974, indicative of an acceleration in internal&#13;
migration. There was a larger increase in the index for females than&#13;
males. Using the indirect estimate of net intercensal internal migration&#13;
(Table 18), the displacement indices in relation to population in 1974 are&#13;
5.1, 7.7, and 6.3 percents respectively for males, females, and both sexes.&#13;
The inter-censal displacement rates were 6.1, 9.1, and 7.5 for males, females,&#13;
and all persons. These estimates of the magnitude of population displacement&#13;
during the intercensal period confirm the previous finding that more females&#13;
than males were displaced during the period.&#13;
The effectiveness of internal migration in redistributing population&#13;
can be measured by calculating the effectiveness index, defined as the ratio&#13;
of net migration to turnover for the various areal units (United Nations,&#13;
1970); these ratios for 1962 and 1974 are given in Table 38. The percent in-&#13;
dex varies between 0 and 100 signifying complete ineffectiveness to perfect&#13;
effectiveness of internal migration in population redistribution. The 2 ex-&#13;
tremes denote equal in and out migration, and migration in one direction&#13;
only. In 1962, internal migration was highly effective for Montserrado&#13;
County (+82.1 percent) and Eastern Province (-74.3 percent). The lowest&#13;
effectiveness was noted for Maryland (+15.7 percent). In 1974, the highest&#13;
and lowest effectiveness ratios were noted in Montserrado (+88.7 percent)&#13;
and Grand Cape Mount Counties (-13.1 percent). Thus, in 1974, of 10 per-&#13;
sons involved in lifetime migration turnover between Montserrado County and&#13;
the rest of the country, 9 remained in the county.&#13;
Migration Selectivity by Age and Sex&#13;
An indication of the selectivity of migration can be obtained by&#13;
comparing the characteristics of migrants with those of nonmigrants or the&#13;
general population. In this study the former comparison is employed. The&#13;
available data relate only to selectivity by age and sex. In considering&#13;
differences between the age and sex patterns of migrants and non-migrants,&#13;
it must be remembered that changes in the former group are brought about&#13;
by further in-migration, out-migration, and deaths while in the latter, by&#13;
out-migration, deaths, return migration, and births.&#13;
About 62 percent of lifetime migrants in 1962 were in the age group&#13;
15-44 years. There were more male than female migrants in the age groups&#13;
15-29 and 30-44 years. In both cases, there were more migrants in the younger&#13;
age group (15-29 years) than in the older one (30-44 years) (Table 39). Most&#13;
female migrants were concentrated in the age group 15-29 years. Since the&#13;
data for 1974 utilized 10-year age groupings instead of the 15-year groupings&#13;

employed in 1962, the pattern of migration selectivity by age in 1974 appears&#13;
slightly different from that in 1962. The highest selectivity of lifetime&#13;
male migrants in 1974 was observed in the age group 25-34 years. In the&#13;
case of female migrants, the same phenomenon with lower intensity (118 per-&#13;
cent against 55 percent) occurred in the age group 15-24 years. It is clear&#13;
from the analysis of age selectivity in 1962 and 1974 (Tables 39 and 40)&#13;
that migrants are concentrated in the productive age groups of 15-44 years.&#13;
Males exhibit a slightly older age selectivity than females. The pattern&#13;
may reflect the difference between age at marriage of males and females.&#13;
Lifetime migration in 1962 and 1974 was male selective in all age&#13;
groups for which data were available. The selectivity in 1962 was highest&#13;
(50 percent) in the age group 15-29 years and lowest (7 percent) in the ages&#13;
under 15. Further, the selectivity presents a unimodal curve probably&#13;
with a peak around 30 years in both census years (Table 41).&#13;
Thus, lifetime internal migration in Liberia is male selective,&#13;
with a maximum selectivity of 30 years of age. Lifetime male migrants appear&#13;
to be slightly older than female migrants. With advancing age, the excess&#13;
of males over females among migrants increases. In 1962, the excess of&#13;
males per 100 females among lifetime migrants in the ages 0-15, 15-29, 30-44&#13;
and 45+ years were 20, 32, 80, and 108. In 1974, the ages under 15 showed&#13;
an excess of 11 males per 100 females, whereas the age groups 25-34, 35-44&#13;
and 45+ showed excesses of 25, 92, and 116 males. The age group 15-24 had a&#13;
balanced sex ratio (99 males per 100 females) among migrants.&#13;
Duration of Stay&#13;
The LPGS collected data on intended duration of stay at the place&#13;
of enumeration. A question on duration of residence at the place of enumera-&#13;
tion was introduced in the 1974 census but because of certain inconsistencies,&#13;
the data from this source are not used in the present analysis. From LPGS&#13;
data it appears that a majority of rural-urban migrants (all four streams&#13;
considered) had a vague idea of their intended duration of stay. More than&#13;
98 percent of the migrants wanted to stay at the place of enumeration for&#13;
more than 3 years. This was true for each migration stream.&#13;
The preceding observation did not hold for international migrants.&#13;
The distribution of immigrants and emigrants by intended duration of their&#13;
stay (Tables 42 and 43) suggest 2 patterns -- (1) long duration of stay of&#13;
more than 3 years, and (2) short duration stay of less than 6 months. It&#13;
may be noted in Table 42 that more than 90 percent of the immigrants in-&#13;
tended to stay in Liberia for a period exceeding 3 years. A similar pattern&#13;
was revealed by the intended duration of stay of emigrants from Liberia in&#13;
Liberia for a short-duration-stay of less than 6 months. The distribution&#13;
of emigrants in 1971 by intended duration of stay abroad was different from&#13;
that for immigrants in each of the 2 years considered and also from that for&#13;
emigrants in 1970. In 1971, only about one-half of the emigrants from rural&#13;
areas intended to stay abroad for a period exceeding 3 years. The correspond-&#13;
ing percentage for emigrants from urban areas was 76.&#13;

Reasons for Migration&#13;
The LPGS identified the following 4 reasons for migration: to&#13;
seek work, take a job, marry, or attend school. A residual group of other&#13;
reasons included all who could not be classified into the preceding. In the&#13;
case of family migrations, the reason for which the head of the household&#13;
migrated was assigned to the remaining household members. This consideration&#13;
placed a serious limitation on the interpretation of data. To overcome this&#13;
bias, our analysis will consider the reasons for migration of those aged 15&#13;
or more years. An additional limitation on the use of the data was posed by&#13;
the fact that while tabulating the reasons for migration no differentiation&#13;
was made between in-migration, immigration, or within-area movements; all&#13;
reasons were classified as pertaining to either in-migration or out-migration&#13;
only. The data, therefore, could not be tabulated by area of origin. Here&#13;
we will consider the data collected through the in-migration approach for&#13;
the reasons stated in the introduction.&#13;
The most important reason for migration appeared to be economic --&#13;
to seek work or take a job. About 1 in every 3 male migrants to urban&#13;
areas, and 1 in every 5 male migrants to rural areas, moved for these rea-&#13;
sons. The same was true for females. Economic reasons for migration, as&#13;
might be expected, are more predominant among moves to urban areas than rural&#13;
areas. Another important reason for male migration (1 in 10) was education,&#13;
whereas for females, marriage was an important predisposing reason (about 12&#13;
percent). Unspecified reasons for migration accounted for more than one-&#13;
half of the total migrations, which may give rise to an unstable pattern of&#13;
migration (Table 44).&#13;
Demographic and Economic Impact of International Migration&#13;
The net gain of population in Liberia due to international migration&#13;
appears to be quite small, below 5 per 1000 population per year. This is sub-&#13;
stantiated by data from the LPGS and is also reflected in the relatively small&#13;
increment during 1962-1974 of only 28,000 in the number of immigrants. This&#13;
net gain was small in spite of the "Open Door" policy of the Republic of&#13;
Liberia. Further, most of the international migrations occur across boun-&#13;
daries with neighbouring countries and appear to be balanced in terms of the&#13;
exchange of population. Thus, the impact on demographic conditions in Liberia&#13;
or the neighbouring countries appears negligible. For example, the intercensal&#13;
rates of growth for the total population and for the total in-born population&#13;
in Liberia were 47.9 and 46.6 percent respectively. For the period 1962-1974,&#13;
unfortunately, we have no information readily available on the number of emi-&#13;
grants who were born in Liberia. However, judging from the findings of the&#13;
LPGS, we may assume that a number of persons born in Liberia emigrated during&#13;
the intercensal period. The number is unlikely to be large enough to offset&#13;
the effect of immigration, but it may raise the rate of growth during 1962 -&#13;
1974 for the population born in Liberia. This phenomenon would reduce the&#13;
already low difference (1.3 percent) between the intercensal rates of growth&#13;
of the total population and the population born in Liberia. Thus, the impact&#13;
of international migration on population growth in Liberia appears to be&#13;
small.&#13;

In spite of the smallness of the volume of international migration,&#13;
its impact on Liberia's economy and development is substantial. It is diffi-&#13;
cult to illustrate this impact quantitatively due to a lack of sufficient&#13;
data. The Statistical Bulletin for Liberia, 1972 (1973b, p. 74), gave em-&#13;
ployment data concerning 96 establishments which employed 20 or more people&#13;
in 1970. Of these, 82 were located in Montserrado County. Only 10 agricul-&#13;
tural, 3 mining, and 1 construction establishment were located outside this&#13;
county. Most of the managerial, executive, and technical positions in these&#13;
establishments were held by expatriates. In addition, most of the small&#13;
commercial enterprises and wholesale and retail stores are owned by per-&#13;
sons of Lebanese and/or Indo-Pakistani origin. The addition of these skills&#13;
to the Liberian labour force makes the contribution of immigration to the&#13;
economy substantial.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
The Gambia is a small country with an economy based mainly on&#13;
traditional rural activities. The country is not urbanized; there are only&#13;
two towns with a population exceeding 10,000. Yet a number of factors make&#13;
migration an important element in the country's population growth and eco-&#13;
nomic activity. First of all, the shape of the country and its location in&#13;
the heart of Senegal make migration from Senegal as easy as, or easier than,&#13;
migration within the country. Secondly, its general economic condition&#13;
relative to that of its neighboring countries is a strong incentive for&#13;
mi6ration to the Gambia at any time, and more so during the not so infreqent&#13;
drought periods. In particular, the presence of extensive agricultural land&#13;
ideally suitable for groundnut cultivation, the economic separateness from&#13;
francophone Africa, and the Gambia's role as an economic enclave are important&#13;
in this regard. Thirdly, some elements of the local culture offer strong&#13;
inducements to segments of the population to seek their fortune elsewhere in&#13;
the country or region. For example, the Wolof households (14 percent of the&#13;
Gambian population and possibly as much as 60 percent of the immigrants from&#13;
Senegal) are polygamous and the status of younger brothers in these households&#13;
viz-a-viz the head of the tamily compound and the eldest son is not very much&#13;
different from that of strangers. There is a strong incentive for these young&#13;
men to leave the household.&#13;
Historical data indicate that the Gambian population growth was&#13;
sustained by external migration in most years of the present century. During&#13;
the decade before the last census (1963-73), the rate of population growth&#13;
was 4.5 percent per year. Even allowing for errors of enumeration, there is&#13;
very little doubt that part of this growth was due to external migration. A&#13;
rough estimate is that 42 percent of the growth was due to natural increase,&#13;
14 percent due to net immigration of foreign-born persons, and the balance of&#13;
44 percent principally due to relative under-enumeration in the 1963 census&#13;
or return migration of Gambians and others born in the Gambia. It is most&#13;
likely that return migration of the Gambians is small in comparison to the&#13;
effect of under-enumeration. Most of the immigrants (nearly half) came from&#13;
Senegal and the balance from the Republic of Guinea (19 percent), Guinea&#13;
Bissau (13 percent), Mali, and Mauritania. The western areas in the Gambia&#13;
(banjul, Kombo St. Mary, and Brikama), were the principal recipients of these&#13;
immigrants.&#13;
Lifetime internal migrants were 14 percent of the native population&#13;
in 1973. This number of migrants increased from 27,000 to 61,000 during&#13;
1963-73 or by 125 percent. These figures indicate a relatively high degree&#13;
of internal population mobility in the Gambia. The areas which gained popula-&#13;
tion by internal migration are the same areas which received the immigrants.&#13;
Taking a very liberal definition of urban population (44 towns,&#13;
several of which had population below 2,000 in 1973), the urban population&#13;
increased from 94,000 to 163,000 or by 72 percent. Net migration (internal&#13;
and external) appears to account for nearly two-thirds of the urban growth.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- G. 2 -&#13;
Towns with a population in the range 2,000-5,000 in 1963 had the highest rate&#13;
of net in-migration. However, their location near Banjul appeared to be&#13;
pertinent to this high growth, although Banjul itself had a relatively low&#13;
net in-migration rate.&#13;
Migrants' characteristics viz-a-viz non-migrants in the Gambia are&#13;
similar to those in other West African countries. Migrants included more&#13;
males than females and they had a relatively higher proportion in the young&#13;
working ages 15-34 years. Migrants had fewer years of schooling and occupied&#13;
on the whole, low level occupations. Viewing all these characteristics, the&#13;
immigrants and non-migrants appear at two extremes, with internal migrants&#13;
falling inbetween.&#13;
Migration to the Gambia appears to have been beneficial to both&#13;
the migrants and the host country. Despite the social disruption entailed,&#13;
migration to the Gambia, especially for groundnut cultivation, appears to&#13;
have brought tangible benefits to the migrants in terms of higher income and&#13;
access to a range of goods not available in their native place. For the host&#13;
country, with excess land and scarce labor, the short-term benefits of immi-&#13;
gration are clear, but the long-term implications depend on the pattern of&#13;
migration, information on which is not readily available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The Gambia is the smallest of the countries included in this&#13;
study, both in terms of area and population. With a population of about&#13;
a half million in 1977 and an area of 10,400 km2, the country is densely&#13;
populated by West African standards (53 persons per sq. km.)     It lies along&#13;
both sides of the Gambia River forming an enclave inside Senegal 200 miles&#13;
long and 10 miles wide on either side of the river (Map 1). The boundaries&#13;
of the country were not dictated by ethnic nor geographic considerations but&#13;
by European politics of the latter part of the nineteenth century.&#13;
The economy of the Gambia consists mostly of traditional small&#13;
holding rural activities: agriculture, livestock and fisheries. Agriculture&#13;
is mainly rainfed and is characterized by a short production period limited to&#13;
about 6 months during the rainy season (June - November). The principal crop&#13;
is groundnuts - the only cash crop of the Gambia, the main source of foreign&#13;
exchange, and the basis of the country's major industrial activity, namely,&#13;
groundnut oil milling.&#13;
The Gambia's small size, unique geographic shape and location,&#13;
climate and economic activity, have several important implications for the&#13;
pattern of population movement to and from the country and within the country&#13;
itself.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. GENERAL DEMOGRAPHIC SITUATION&#13;
The total population of the country is estimated at about 550,000&#13;
for 1977. This makes it the smallest country included in the study, having&#13;
about one-third the population of the next largest country (Liberia). The&#13;
latest census of the country, conducted in April 1973, enumerated 493,000&#13;
persons and indicated a growth rate of 4.5 percent per year between 1963 and&#13;
1973. At the beginning of this century, the total population of the country&#13;
was under 100,000, but the growth rate was as high as that observed during&#13;
the latest intercensal period. In between these two dates the rate of pop-&#13;
ulation growth was not very high; and in fact, around 1930 there was a net&#13;
decrease in the total size of the country's population (Table 1).&#13;
The high and fluctuating rate of growth indicates that population&#13;
growth in the Gambia has been influenced by external migration. In 1973,&#13;
although the crude birth rate was very high (about 50 per 1,000), the crude&#13;
death rate was also very high (about 30 per 1,000). Thus, natural increase&#13;
may not have been higher than 2.0 percent annually.   More than half of the&#13;
4.5 percent 1963-73 average annual growth rate is estimated to have resulted&#13;
from under-enumeration in the 1963 census, and return migration of natives,&#13;
with the remainder (0.6 percent) due to immigration.&#13;
Banjul is the largest town and the capital of the country. Its&#13;
population in 1973 was only 39,000 or 8 percent of the country's population&#13;
(Table 2). between 1963 and 1973, the population of Banjul grew at an average&#13;
of 3.4 percent annually, 1.1 percentage points less than the national growth&#13;
rate. The effect of under-enumeration in 1963 is unknown, but it is possible&#13;
that the influx of external migration has been less intense in Banjul than in&#13;
the rest of the country. The highest annual growth rate of Banjul's popula-&#13;
tion occurred during 1921-30 (4.4 percent) at a time when the national popu-&#13;
lation decreased by 0.5 percent per year (see Table 3).&#13;
The pattern of urban growth in the Gambia in recent years is in-&#13;
dicated in Tables 4 and 5. The annual rate of urban growth during 1963-73 was&#13;
greater than the national annual growth rate by 0.9 percentage units. It is&#13;
not clear whether the differential is due to internal migration or external&#13;
migration. The urban death rate is possibly lower than the rural death rate,&#13;
and a higher natural increase could be one of the reasons for the higher&#13;
urban growth rate.&#13;
As mentioned above, Banjul experienced only a moderate growth&#13;
rate over the intercensal period, 1963-73. Towns in the population size&#13;
range (in 1963) 2,000 - 5,000 had the highest growth rate. However, in&#13;
general, there was no consistent relationship between the size of a town&#13;
and its recent annual rate of population growth.&#13;
/        The Gambia is divided into 4 Divisions, having a total of 8 Local&#13;
Government Areas (see Map 1). The 8 Local Government Areas are divided into&#13;
37 Enumeration Districts.   Census data are given for the Local Government&#13;
Areas and the Enumeration Districts (see Tables 6 and 7). Banjul and Kombo&#13;
St. Mary are relatively small Local Areas located on the mouth of the Gambia&#13;
River on its southern bank. Brikama Area occupies much of the western part&#13;

of the country on the Atlantic coast. Mansakoko and Kerewan constitute the&#13;
Lower River Division, the latter Local Area on the northern side and the&#13;
former on the southern side of the river. Macarthy Island Division lies at&#13;
the bend of the river. This Division consists of 2 Local Government Areas:&#13;
Kuntaur and Georgetown. Basse Area lies in the Upper River Division and&#13;
forms the easternmost part of the country.&#13;
Kerewan Local Government Area in the Lower River Division is&#13;
the most populous of-all the 8 Areas. This Area contains the land most&#13;
suitable for groundnut cultivation in the country. However, in 1973 the&#13;
density of population in this Area was only 43 persons per km2, less than&#13;
the national average by 3 persons per km2. Density was highest in Banjul&#13;
(Table 2) which supported a population of 39,000 in only 12.7 km2. In&#13;
general, the western regions were more densely inhabited than the eastern&#13;
regions.&#13;
The rates of population growth varied from 11.7 percent per year&#13;
in Kombo St. Mary Area to 2.2 percent in Mansakonko Local Area. With a&#13;
prevailing high death rate in the country, it is most likely that the dif-&#13;
ferences in regional growth rates are partly due to differentials in natural&#13;
increase. It is, however, difficult to isolate this effect. The possible&#13;
contribution of internal and external migration is discussed in this report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. EXTERNAL MIGRATION&#13;
Conditions in the Gambia are ideally suited for significant ex-&#13;
ternal migration. First of all the country is small, and any part of the&#13;
Gambia can be reached from Senegal by traveling not more than 10-20 miles.&#13;
Secondly, the ribbonlike shape of the country is conducive more to external&#13;
than internal migration. Thirdly, the Gambia contains excellent agricultural&#13;
land including some of the best land available for groundnut cultivation.&#13;
When interior countries suffer from drought, much of the land in the Gambia&#13;
remains cultivable because of the availability of water from the river.&#13;
The statistics on external migration reveal a rather high rate of&#13;
immigration, but the level is not as high as in the Ivory Coast in recent&#13;
years. In 1973 there were 52,000 non-Gambians in the country, of whom&#13;
only 1,000 were non-Africans. Nearly half (25,000) the foreign nationals were&#13;
from Senegal; the majority of the other immigrants came from Guinea (19.5&#13;
percent from Guinea Bissau) (Tables 8 and 9).&#13;

The number of persons enumerated in the Gambia in 1973 born out-&#13;
side the country totaled 55,000. This number exceeds the number of foreign&#13;
nationals by about 2,500. It shows that most foreign nationals in the Gambia&#13;
do not bring their families; very few foreign nationals have children born in&#13;
the Gambia (Table 10). On the other hand, a number of the Gambians were born&#13;
outside their country.&#13;
The number of foreign nationals increased from 35,000 in 1963 to&#13;
52,000 in 1973 (Table 9). The increase was 16,000 or 3.8 percent per year.&#13;
These figures imply a net immigration of approximately 20,000 during the 10-&#13;

year period 1963-73. However, the total net immigration may be different as&#13;
it includes immigration and emigration of the Gambians also. As shown later,&#13;
there is reason to believe that some of the Gambians who were living outside&#13;
the country in 1963 returned during 1963-73.&#13;
The rate of increase of Senegalese nationals in the Gambia was&#13;
substantially lower than the rate of growth of most other nationals (Table&#13;
9). The increase was largest for nationals from Mauritania and Mali, and&#13;
least for those from Sierra Leone. The Senegalese nationals grew at less&#13;
than half the rate of growth of the foreign nationals as a whole.&#13;
In general, the western areas received most of the immigrants over&#13;
the intercensal period (Table 11). Banjul, Kombo St. Mary, and Brikama each&#13;
had about 16-17 percent of their population from outside the country. The&#13;
lowest impact of immigration was in the Basse Area where only 3 percent of the&#13;
population were immigrants. 1/&#13;
Table 12 indicates the percent increase of immigrants by Local Gov-&#13;
ernment Area over the intercensal period. Kombo St. Mary's immigrant popula-&#13;
tion increased 127 percent over the period (1963-73); and Kerewan's by 120&#13;
percent. Basse's, on the other hand, declined by 11 percent. Kerewan's&#13;
growth in immigrant population is particularly pointed, given that its native&#13;
population increased by only 41 percent.&#13;
No data on emigration are available from the Gambian sources. The&#13;
1971 Demographic Survey of Senegal indicated that there were about 33,000&#13;
Gambian lifetime immigrants in that country, of whom 16,000 were living in&#13;
the Casamance region adjoining the Gambia. In addition there were about&#13;
5,000 temporary Gambian immigrants who had lived in Senegal for a period of&#13;
less than 6 months. The data from the other African countries do not indi-&#13;
cate any significant emigration of the Gambians to these countries. Thus&#13;
the Gambian emigration is likely to be much smaller than immigration to that&#13;
country, and on balance the country has gained population as a result of&#13;
external migration in recent years.&#13;
1/   The possibility of under-enumeration of foreign nationals cannot be&#13;
rejected in the Basse Area, however, since recent research by Kenneth&#13;
Swindell showed one-half of household heads to be from Guinea in a vil-&#13;
lage close to Basse Town (Swindell, 1978, personal communication).&#13;

IV. INTERNAL MIGRATION&#13;
As noted above, the Gambia is divided into 8 Local Government&#13;
Areas: Banjul, Kombo St. Nary, Brikama, Manasakonko, Kerewan, Kuntaur,&#13;
Georgetown, and Basse. As the census data relate to these areas, our&#13;
discussion of internal migration is mainly confined to migration between&#13;
them.&#13;
Table 13 gives the summary data for 1963 and 1973. In 1973, about&#13;
61,000 persons were enumerated outside the Local Government Area in which&#13;
they were born. They constituted 14 percent of the total Gambian-born popu-&#13;
lation. A comparison with other countries is difficult because of differences&#13;
in the size of countries, yet the rate indicates a relatively high degree of&#13;
population mobility in the country.&#13;
The principal area of attraction was Kombo St. Mary Local Area&#13;
which received 19,000 in-migrants and sent out only 2,000 out-migrants. The&#13;
3 western Areas together had a lifetime in-migration of 39,000 (64 percent of&#13;
the total), lifetime out-migration of 21,000, and a net gain of 18,000 per-&#13;
sons. Kerewan Local Government Area had the largest volume of out-migration&#13;
and the largest net loss due to migration. On the whole, all the eastern&#13;
(upper) Local Areas had net losses due to internal migration.&#13;
The origins of the migrants in the Kombo St. Mary Local Area are&#13;
indicated in Table 14. Most of the migrants to Kombo St. Mary came from&#13;
Banjul and the neighboring Brikama Local Area.&#13;
As mentioned above, Kerewan Local Area had the highest out-&#13;
migration. The largest number went to Banjul (3,900) and more or less&#13;
equal numbers went to Kombo St. Mary and Brikama Local Areas (Table 15).&#13;
In summary, the 1973 birth place data indicate that internal migra-&#13;
tion in the Gambia was mainly toward the western parts of the country, the&#13;
principal destination being Kombo St. Mary and the principal origin being&#13;
Kerewan Local Area.&#13;
In 1963, the total inter-Area lifetime migration was only 27,000&#13;
or about 9.6 percent of the Gambian-born population. Thus lifetime migration&#13;
increased considerably (125 percent) during 1963-73 not only in absolute&#13;
terms but also in relation to the total native-born population of the coun-&#13;
try. The largest increase was in Kombo St. Mary - from 3,800 to 18,600, or&#13;
a 393 percent increase. Other large increases were observed in all 3 western&#13;
Local Areas. In 2 of the Local Areas, Kerewan and Kuntaur, there were de-&#13;
creases in the number of in-migrants.&#13;

The number of out-migrants increased in all the Local Areas, but&#13;
some of the largest increases were observed in Kerewan (7,700), Brikama&#13;
(6,700), and Mansakonko (5,100).&#13;
between 1963 and 1973, Banjul, Brikama, Mansakonko, and Kerewan&#13;
appear to have lost population through internal migration and all the other&#13;
Areas appear to have gained. The largest gain was observed in Kombo St. Mary&#13;
where the net gain was about 16,000. The gains in the other Local Areas were&#13;
relatively minimal.&#13;
An approximation of the composition of population growth by Local&#13;
Government Areas from 1963-73 is given in Table 16. The total population&#13;
growth in the country during 1963-73 was about 178,000. Natural increase,&#13;
including that among the foreign-born who came to the country before 1973,&#13;
was approximately 75,000 leaving a balance of 103,000. Net immigration among&#13;
the foreign-born is unlikely to have been more than 25,000 leaving an un-&#13;
accounted residue of 77,000. This is too large a figure to be considered an&#13;
error of estimation.&#13;
In estimating natural increase, a rate of 2.0 percent during 1963-73&#13;
was used. If the rate was indeed as high as 2.5 percent, the residue would&#13;
still have been as high as 59,000. Other reasons have to be found for this&#13;
unexplained residue. Two possible reasons are relative underenumeration in&#13;
&#13;

to underenumeration, the error would be on the order of 25 percent. Consid-&#13;
ering the effects of both return migration and census errors, the 1963-73&#13;
growth rate may be disaggregated as follows:&#13;
1.  Total annual growth rate, 1963-73      4.5       100.0&#13;
2.  Natural increase                       1.9        42&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
V. RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION&#13;
The total population of the 44 selected towns in the Gambia (see&#13;
Table 4) increased from 95,000 to 163,000 during 1963-73. If the rate of&#13;
natural increase in the towns is assumed to be about 25 percent higher than&#13;
that of rural areas (on the assumption that the urban death rate is much&#13;
lower than the rural death rate), net in-migration to the towns would be&#13;
about 44,000 or nearly two-thirds of the total growth, as follows:&#13;
1. Total population of 44 selected towns&#13;
1963                             94,609&#13;
1973                            162,572&#13;
2. Growth during 1963-73&#13;
absolute                         67,962&#13;
% increase                       71.8&#13;
3.  Estimate, natural increase                         24,000&#13;
4.  Net migration (internal and external)              44,000&#13;
5.  Net migration as % of total urban growth           64.7&#13;
Much of the urban growth occurred in towns in the Kombo St. Mary&#13;
Area (Bakau and Serekunda), Banjul, and Brikama town. These 4 towns received&#13;
more than 80 percent of the migration to towns in the Gambia. Some of the&#13;
other towns which had significant net in-migration were Gamissara in the&#13;
Basse Area, and Farafenni in the Kerewan Area. On the whole, however, towns&#13;
in the eastern Areas experienced little in-migration. In fact, several of&#13;
them had net out-migration (Saba, Salikeni, Njakunda, Nokunda in the Kerewan&#13;
Area, Jiroff and Jassong in the Mansakonka Area).&#13;
The largest town and the only one with a population of 5,000 or&#13;
above in 1963 was Banjul. Net-migration to Banjul is estimated to have been&#13;
about 4,400 over the 1963-73 period. Relative to population, the highest net&#13;
in-migration rate was observed for towns in the range 2,000 - 5,000 in 1963&#13;
(see Table 17).&#13;
However, it is unlikely that population size was the significant&#13;
factor which affected in-migration to the towns; a more important factor&#13;
could be the location of the towns. Most of the towns in the 2,000 - 5,000&#13;
size bracket are located in Kombo St. Mary and the Brikama Area.&#13;

VI. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MIGRANTS&#13;
Available information on the characteristics of migrants in the&#13;
Gambia is sketchy, but what is available from the 1973 census indicates that&#13;
migrants in the Gambia are somewhat similar to those in other countries of&#13;
the region. Thus, the immigrants included 57 percent more males than females,&#13;
and among both males and females, the highest number were in the age group&#13;
25-29 years. The average age of immigrant males was 6.8 years higher than&#13;
that of females (see Table 18). Immigrants from Senegal and Guinea Bissau--&#13;
countries which lie close to the Gambia--had a more balanced sex ratio than&#13;
those from Guinea, Mali, and Mauritania--countries further away--as shown&#13;
below:&#13;
Country of Origin               Males per 100 Females, 1973&#13;
Senegal                                     116&#13;

Mauritania                                  467&#13;
Among internal migrants (those born outside the district of enu-&#13;
meration), the sex ratio was less than that of immigrants. The sex ratio of&#13;
internal migrants fell between that of external migrants and non-migrants,&#13;
as follows:&#13;
Sex ratio (1973) of those&#13;
1.  Born outside Gambia                   157&#13;
2. Born outside the district&#13;
of enumeration, but within&#13;

A similar pattern was observed with respect to age distribution.&#13;
The proportion of population in the prime working ages, 15-34 years, was 30&#13;
percent among non-migrants and 45 percent among external migrants in 1973.&#13;
The corresponding proportion for internal migrants fell inbetween (41 per-&#13;
cent), as below:&#13;

As in all other West African countries, immigrants had less educa-&#13;
tion than natives. The differences were particularly great among males&#13;
at the younger ages. The proportion of immigrants in the Gambia who had&#13;
completed at least a primary education was only half as much as among the&#13;
Gambians in the 15-29 age group in 1973 (see Table 20). However, among&#13;
older women (25+ years) the immigrants were slightly better educated than&#13;
the natives.&#13;
No information is available on the occupational characteristics&#13;
of immigrants. On the basis of their educational attainment and the&#13;
information given in the following annex by Prof. Swindell, it appears that&#13;
most of them are engaged in agricultural occupations as farm workers during&#13;
the wet season; and if they remain in the country during the dry season, they&#13;
pursue other relatively low level occupations in the towns or villages.&#13;
There seems to be enough evidence to believe that, as in other countries of&#13;
West Africa, immigrants in the Gambia are principally engaged in relatively&#13;
low level occupations, such as "Strange Farmers" (see Annex) and in the&#13;
informal sector in towns.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The Strange Farmers of The Gambia are rural migrants who have&#13;
been associated with the cultivation of groundnuts since the beginning of&#13;
the nineteenth century, when the crop was first exported. This particular&#13;
migratory system is one of the oldest labor movements in West Africa and&#13;
has continued almost unchanged up to the present day. Groundnut cultiva-&#13;
tion in Senegambia was probably initiated by the response of long-distance&#13;
traders to the market opportunities provided by their European counterparts;&#13;
in particular, the Serahuli (Sarakole) and Mandinka traders from the Upper&#13;
Senegal and Niger river basins became interested in groundnut cultivation&#13;
as the slave trade declined. Subsequently, the local population (especially&#13;
the Wolof) of Senegambia became attracted to the cultivation of groundnuts,&#13;
and eventually in the twentieth century the railway diffused its commercial&#13;
cultivation back inland toward Mali.&#13;
The seasonality of labor migration in West Africa is commonplace,&#13;
although such movements may be slackening and giving way to more extended&#13;
stays from home, together with permanent settlement. Considerable attention&#13;
has been focused on dry season movements from the interior by men looking&#13;
for work in the better endowed and developed coastlands, which frequently&#13;
have involved a particular ethnic group. Labor migration received a great&#13;
stimulus at the end of the nineteenth century and in the early years of the&#13;
twentieth century with the growing influence and control of the colonial&#13;
powers, and the introduction of taxation. But in addition to men migrat-&#13;
ing to earn cash to pay taxes, other reasons have been cited such as money&#13;
for bridewealth, personal consumption, and family maintenance, together with&#13;
the desire to escape from the traditional constraints of the family. One of&#13;
the dominant types of migration observed has been associated with agricul-&#13;
ture, especially cash-crop farming, and it has usually been classed as a rural&#13;
to rural migration of young men, generally illiterates, engaged as low paid&#13;
wage labour, contract workers, or share croppers. It is against this kind&#13;
of regional background that one can examine the Strange Farmer system; but&#13;
what is a Strange Farmer?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. THE STRANGE FARMER SYSTEM&#13;
A Strange Farmer, or in the case of Senegal, a navetane, is gen-&#13;
erally described as a seasonal migrant, who comes into the Senegambian ground-&#13;
nut basin to cultivate groundnuts from April to December. 1/ The Strange&#13;
Farmer system rests on a contractual arrangements between a host farmer and&#13;
migrant, whereby an agreed number of days is worked for the host (usually&#13;
between 2 and 4), and on the remaining days the migrant is at liberty to&#13;
cultivate groundnuts on his own farm provided by the host. During his stay,&#13;
the migrant is provided with food, a hoe, or the use of the host's plough,&#13;
and if necessary the loan of seednuts, together with a hut within the com-&#13;
pound which he may share with other Strange Farmers. Migrants search for a&#13;
host in the villages; and in some cases, hosts seek out Strange Farmers. The&#13;
contractual arrangement may be affected by a variety of informal networks,&#13;
sometimes with the leader of a group of migrants acting as intermediary.&#13;
Repeated migration leads to a "matching" system which builds up a relation-&#13;
ship between host and client.&#13;
Most Strange Farmers are aged between 18 and 35 years, although&#13;
few of them know their ages with accuracy; but most migrants are in this age&#13;
range because hosts require able-bodied men capable of a good day's work,&#13;
otherwise they are not accepted as Strange Farmers. Such selectivity effec-&#13;
tively rules out young boys and older men. However, at harvest-time boys&#13;
aged between 13 and 16 years appear in the villages as casual laborers, and&#13;
they are paid by the field of groundnut lifted, or stack threshed. Such mi-&#13;
grants are referred to as m'baragnini or firdu, and they are local migrants&#13;
moving between neighbouring villages. 2/ These casual workers were not in-&#13;
cluded in the survey discussed in this annex, but when they are combined&#13;
with the local movements of Strange Farmers, they collectively demonstrate&#13;
the importance of small-scale intra- and inter-village labor migration,&#13;
which is of considerable value to groundnut farmers. Localized labor move-&#13;
ments have received less attention than their long-distance counterparts,&#13;
although the former frequently provide vital labor inputs for small-scale&#13;
family farms.&#13;
This system is quite different from share-cropping with which it&#13;
is frequently confused, and it is essentially derived from a combination of&#13;
labor shortage and land surplus. The advantage for the host is that he&#13;
receives extra labor inputs without any need for cash payment of wages;&#13;
while the migrant, according to the size and quality of his groundnut farm,&#13;
1/   It is generally assumed that the term "navetane" is derived from the&#13;
Wolof word "navet" which means "rainy season". However, an alterna-&#13;
tive interpretation is that navetane is derived from the French for&#13;
shuttle, "navette", which denotes the seasonal movements between a&#13;
migrant's home and the groundnut basin of Senegambia.&#13;
2/   "M'baragnini" and "firdu" are Mandinka and Wolof terms respectively&#13;
for casual day labourers used for lifting groundnuts. See H. Labouret,&#13;
1941.&#13;

will produce his own crop, the money from which accrues to him alone at the&#13;
end of the season. Groundnuts are a wet season crop, and unlike tree crops,&#13;
have a quick production cycle; thus, after approximately 7 months the migrant&#13;
has cash in hand, some of which he may spend on imported goods to take back&#13;
home. Estimates for the 1974-75 farming season show that a migrant earned&#13;
an average E 50-E 60, from which there would be minimal deductions for&#13;
travel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. THE NUMBER, ORIGINS AND DESTINATIONS OF MIGRANTS&#13;
During the 1974-75 farming season, the Gambian government imple-&#13;
mented its first agricultural survey, based on a sampling procedure devised&#13;
by the F.A.O. as part of the census of world agriculture. 1/ The basic unit&#13;
of enumeration adopted by the survey was the farming unit known as a dabada,&#13;
one or more of which may comprise a household. 2/ Within the rural areas&#13;
there were an estimated 32,000 dabadas of which 3,000 were sampled to mea-&#13;
sure crop areas and yields, as well as listing economically active members&#13;
and strangers. In addition to the general survey, a special Strange Farmer&#13;
Survey was implemented in 960 dabadas, which gave more detailed information&#13;
on 1,024 migrant farmers.&#13;
The Sample Survey of Strange Farmers in 1974-75 yielded an esti-&#13;
mated total of 33,000 Strange Farmers, and this figure is substantial in&#13;
the light of claims that numbers were decreasing; in fact, the number of&#13;
migrants was higher than previously recorded through the local tax returns&#13;
on strangers. 3/ Compared with Senegal, the Strange Farmer system appears&#13;
to be flourishing. In Senegal, these seasonal farmers are called navetanes&#13;
and the development of the extensive groundnut areas in Cayor and Baol in&#13;
the nineteenth century saw large numbers coming each year from Mali and&#13;
Guinea. It appears now that migrant numbers have decreased from over 70,000&#13;
navetanes after World War II to approximately 9-11,000 in the 1970s&#13;
(Vanhaeverbeke, 1970); however, these data refer only to non-Senegalese&#13;
migrants from Mali and Guinea, and there is evidence that internal movements&#13;
of migratory labor continue (Elkan, 1976).&#13;
One problem of enumerating migrant groundnut farmers is that both&#13;
local migrants and other nationals are involved in the same system. Until&#13;
1955, tax returns in the Gambia made some attempt to separate Gambians from&#13;
non-Gambians, and these suggested that between one-sixth to one-quarter of&#13;
1/   The Strange Farmer Survey was a subsidiary of the Agricultural Sample&#13;
Survey of The Gambia operated by the F.A.O. in association with the&#13;
Central Statistics Division of The Gambia during the farming season of&#13;
1974-75. The Strange Farmer Survey was devised by K. Swindell in asso-&#13;
ciation with D. Y. Lele of F.A.O. who was the Director of the Agricul-&#13;
tural Survey.&#13;
2/   While the most easily recognized village unit is the compound, it may&#13;
contain one or more farming households, termed "dabadas". In turn a&#13;
"dabada" may contain one or more "sinkiros", which are separate cooking&#13;
units in a joint family.&#13;
3/   Taxes on Strange Farmers and lodgers were implemented by the British in&#13;
1885 and have continued to be collected by the local authorities. In&#13;
1974-75 the rate per stranger was 5 dalasis (E 1.25). The tax lists&#13;
formed the only means of assessing the number of Strange Farmers prior&#13;
to the 1974-75 Survey.&#13;
- G.39 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- G.40 -&#13;
migrants could be viewed as internal movers. The Strange Farmer Survey in-&#13;
quired as to the migrant's home town or village and its location by admin-&#13;
istrative region or circle and country. The results showed that 25 percent&#13;
(equivalent to 8,000) were in fact Gambians, with the remaining 75 percent&#13;
(24,000) principally from Senegal, Mali, and Guinea, and a minority from&#13;
Guinea Bissau, Lower Mauritania and Upper Volta (Annex Table 1). Thus, the&#13;
Strange Farmer Survey represents the first attempt to measure and define the&#13;
origins of these migrants.&#13;
before examining the declared home origins of the Strange Farmers,&#13;
it may be appropriate to discuss some of the general assumptions which have&#13;
been made about agricultural workers. For example, it is usually assumed that&#13;
they move from one rural area to another. The Strange Farmer Survey inquired&#13;
not only into the country of origin but also the specific place, so that it&#13;
might be determined whether migrants came from a town or a village. Another&#13;
aspect of labor migration is whether there has been a movement between similar&#13;
economic milieus, albeit agricultural ones, or whether migrants are moving&#13;
into quite dissimilar environments from those of their home areas. In some&#13;
parts of West Africa there is a conspicuous movement of men from the interior&#13;
Sahelian and Sudanic regions, bringing them into contact with farming systems&#13;
and economic and social circumstances which are quite different from their&#13;
home areas. The question to what extent labor migrants benefit from working&#13;
away from home is one which is not easy to answer with any accuracy, although&#13;
there exist a flurry of opinions. These and several other issues will be&#13;
discussed in the following analysis which begins by examining the 4 major&#13;
source countries of migrants--Gambia, Senegal, Mali and Guinea--focusing&#13;
on the role of their economic mileus in promoting migration.&#13;

IV. THE GAMBIANS&#13;
An initial clue to why Gambians become internal migrant culti-&#13;
vators can be discerned by examining the location of their declared home&#13;
villages or towns, with respect to their farming locations. For any given&#13;
village, district or region, Strange Farmers may include first, non-locals&#13;
moving into the area and second, locals moving within the area; but one must&#13;
also consider that local men may be leaving to farm elsewhere. Thus, whether&#13;
a district or village has a net gain or loss of Strange Farmers is a function&#13;
of these 3 factors. In order to examine the several types of movement more&#13;
closely, attention has been concentrated on Lower River North Bank and Wes-&#13;
tern Division, which as noted above contained the largest proportion of Gam-&#13;
bian Strange Farmers. The origins of men who migrated into these 2 divisions&#13;
are shown in Annex Figures la-b where they are mapped according to their&#13;
ethnic group.&#13;
Because of the elongated shape of The Gambia, it is conceivable&#13;
that internal movements may cover anything from a few miles up to 300 miles.&#13;
For example, the Lower River North Bank attracted migrants from the length&#13;
of the country on the north and south banks, and migrants were recorded from&#13;
26 out of the total 35 districts excluding the receiving areas in question.&#13;
Because of the configuration of the river and the national boundary, the&#13;
lower river districts have one of the most extensive and productive upland&#13;
areas for groundnut cultivation in the country, and naturally they are some-&#13;
thing of an attraction for Strange Farmers. 1/&#13;
Men moved into the lower river area chiefly from the central dis-&#13;
tricts and from the peripheral area around Banjul, the capital. In both&#13;
cases groundnut land is restricted and population densities were over 70 per&#13;
square km (dry land area) compared with an average in rural areas of 47 per&#13;
square km (Annex Figure 1-c). While there appeared to be a definite westward&#13;
drift of migrants, a surprising number (almost one-third), of the farmers&#13;
came from within Lower River North Bank Division. Further inspection showed&#13;
that one-half of these were moving within their home district, and are best&#13;
described as local circulants.&#13;
Western Division, which is adjacent to the urban areas of Banjul&#13;
and Kombo St. Mary, was another important receiving area and it had the lar-&#13;
gest ratio of Gambian to non-Gambian migrants (Annex Table 1). Population&#13;
densities within the periphery of Banjul were relatively high (see Annex&#13;
Figure 1-c); and according to the origin and destinations of Strange Farmers&#13;
mapped in Annex Figure 1-b, this area was generating local migrants who were&#13;
moving away from the semi-urbanized fringes of Banjul into the eastern part&#13;
of Western Division. In this Division, 17 percent of the Gambian Strange&#13;
Farmers came from urban areas.&#13;
1/   The argument about migrants being attracted by areas of better soil and&#13;
the extensive uplands in Lower River needs treating with some caution&#13;
since the greater acreages of groundnuts are themselves a function of&#13;
the presence of so many Strange Farmers.&#13;

- G. 44 -&#13;
The origin of migrants moving into the remaining divisions of Lower&#13;
River, MacCarthy Island, and Upper River have not been mapped out in detail;&#13;
but these remaining areas were marked by strong local internal movements of&#13;
Gambian Strange Farmers, rather than being points of attraction for long-&#13;
distance migrants. This was particularly true of the central areas of the&#13;
country and Upper River Divisions. It is, of course, true that these areas&#13;
are also sending migrants to the Western and Lower River North Bank Divisions.&#13;
Such areas suffer a net loss of migrant farmers; that is, more leave than are&#13;
generated either locally or received from outside. The distribution of dis-&#13;
tricts having net gains and losses of migrants are shown in Annex Figure 2,&#13;
supporting the contention of a general westward drift of migrants into the&#13;
lower river areas. Thus, the Lower River Divisions exhibited local circula-&#13;
tion and received long-distance migrants, while the central and Upper River&#13;
areas had local circulation and generated long-distance migrants (Annex&#13;
Figure 2).&#13;
From the above analysis, it would seem that the movement of&#13;
Gambian Strange Farmers rests upon several factors. First, there is evi-&#13;
dence that good groundnut land attracts inward movement, whereas areas of&#13;
high population density and limited groundnut potential tend to promote&#13;
outward movement. But this does not explain localized movement, often of&#13;
short distances, between neighbouring villages. Such movement may reflect&#13;
a general inclination of young men wishing to escape the various social&#13;
constraints on farming either in their own compound or home villages. As&#13;
a stranger, a man has the opportunity to decide how he shall spend the pro-&#13;
ceeds of his season's work and, if necessary, accumulate cash for specific&#13;
projects of his own choosing. Such attitudes have been observed elsewhere&#13;
as part of the migratory process; for example, among the Hausa, where the&#13;
Yawon duniya ("the walk of the world") expresses the migrants' desire for&#13;
liberation from social constraints (Olofson, 1976).&#13;
Of the 250 Gambian migrants investigated by the Strange Farmer&#13;
Survey, some 23 percent found hosts within their own district, which means&#13;
they moved no more than a maximum of 10 miles. Some insights into the reasons&#13;
for these movements can be discerned from the studies of Wolof communities&#13;
and their household organization (Gamble, 1957). Wolof households are poly-&#13;
gynous with a double-descent system of lineage, which with the spread of Islam&#13;
has gradually accentuated patrilineality. In such circumstances, the role of&#13;
younger brothers vis-a-vis the head of the family compound and the eldest&#13;
son is such that their socio-economic status is little different from that&#13;
of strangers. Also, it has been observed that friction develops between the&#13;
sons of the same father but different mothers, which may be accentuated by&#13;
the differential allocation of groundnut plots among the younger menfolk of&#13;
the compound. These factors may provide a strong incentive for young men to&#13;
leave the household and become Strange Farmers in neighboring villages, where&#13;
they will have a guaranteed groundnut farm and complete control over the pro-&#13;
ceeds. This socio-cultural aspect of household organization within Sene-&#13;
gambia, especially among the Wolof has also been cited as of considerable&#13;
significance in the colonization and spread of groundnut cultivation by the&#13;
Mouride brotherhood into the arid areas of eastern Senegal (Rocheteau, 1975).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- G.46 -&#13;
Although groundnut cultivation may have been started within the&#13;
Senegambian area by migrants from the interior, it would seem that the emer-&#13;
gence of the Wolof areas as the core of the groundnut basin may well have&#13;
been assisted by the latent propensity for movement by young men who wish&#13;
to become groundnut farmers on their own account. The successful introduc-&#13;
tion of commercial cash cropping into West Africa has been explained by some&#13;
authors with reference to the classical "vent for surplus" theory which takes&#13;
as a basic premise the release of previously under-employed elements in the&#13;
local labor force, who respond to the introduction of new crops (see for&#13;
example Hopkins, 1973). If this is so, it would seem that the introduction&#13;
of groundnuts into Senegambia provided an ideal opportunity for a resolu-&#13;
tion of the factionalism which marks many Senegambian households. Although&#13;
factionalism in Mandinka and Fula households may be less than in those of&#13;
the Wolof, similar situations obtain among these ethnic groups.&#13;
But if younger members of a household leave to become Strange&#13;
Farmers elsewhere, they in turn may have to be replaced by other migrants,&#13;
depending on the household's demographic structure and labor-consumer balance.&#13;
This paradoxical situation which arises from the conditions noted above also&#13;
explains why there is a general exchange of existing labor units within&#13;
villages of a particular region, notwithstanding the net movement toward&#13;
more powerful households and into areas of better groundnut land.&#13;
The introduction of groundnuts as a cash crop also interacted with&#13;
other aspects of indigenous social organization, producing further incen-&#13;
tives for young men to leave home and farm as migrants. In patrilineal so-&#13;
cieties bridewealth is common, but traditionally marriages were arranged&#13;
by the senior members of families on behalf of their children or relatives.&#13;
Formerly, bridewealth was paid in kind or through labor services given by&#13;
the prospective bridegroom to his parents-in-law; but with the speed of&#13;
the cash economy associated with groundnut cultivation bride-prices are now&#13;
generally paid in cash. If the cash payment has been produced by the pro-&#13;
spective bridegroom through his own efforts as a Strange Farmer, it is likely&#13;
that he will wish to choose his bride rather than having one chosen for him.&#13;
In this way, there is an additional incentive for many young men to leave&#13;
home to become migrant farmers for one or two seasons in other parts of The&#13;
Gambia (Fouquet, 1958).&#13;
The multi-ethnicity of the Gambian Strange-Farmer population is&#13;
demonstrated by Annex Figure 1, where migrant-origins are mapped according&#13;
to ethnic group. This mixing reflects the plurality of the Gambian popula-&#13;
tion, which has evolved as several groups whose core areas lie on the peri-&#13;
phery and have expanded into the Gambia valley, attracted by surplus land&#13;
and commercial development which began with the advent of the Portuguese in&#13;
the 15th century. While the Mandinka form the majority of migrants (43&#13;
percent), this is a function of their numerical dominance within the coun-&#13;
try; but, if the composition of the migrant population is compared with&#13;
the relative proportions in the national population, the Fula from upper&#13;
river have an above-average representation, together with the Wolof from&#13;
the heavily populated middle river areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- G.47 -&#13;
If one adds non-Gambians such as the Tilibo 1/ and Bambara from&#13;
Mali, and the Serer from Senegal, then the Strange Farmers comprise a wider&#13;
spectrum of ethnic groups than is found in many migrant streams in West&#13;
Africa. With respect to ethnic matching of migrants and hosts, it is&#13;
difficult to find strong evidence of partiality, especially in lower river&#13;
areas where other cross-cultural factors may be more important. Also, in&#13;
every region of The Gambia there are villages which contain households whose&#13;
ethnicity differs from that of the dominant group.&#13;
1/   Tilibo literally means "man from the east" and describes those Mandinka&#13;
from the region centered on Kangaba, the historic nucleus of Manding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. THE SENEGALESE&#13;
The principal source of Senegalese Strange Farmers was the region&#13;
of Sine Saloum, which accounted for 55 percent of all Senegalese migrants&#13;
(Annex Figure 3). This region which includes the old kingdoms of Cayor and&#13;
Baol is the traditional groundnut area of Senegal and has a population den-&#13;
sity of over 104 per square mile (65 per square km). Traditionally, Sine&#13;
Saloum is the area which has received the navetanes and, according to&#13;
Vanhaeverveke, some 70-73 percent of all navetanes went into this area be-&#13;
tween 1935 and 1962. Thus, an important receiving area of non-Senegalese&#13;
migrants was also the one from which many Senegalese moved into The Gambia&#13;
during the 1974-75 season. The majority of men from Senegal were found in&#13;
Lower River and Western River Divisions and, even from a cursory inspection&#13;
of the map, it can be appreciated that they were moving relatively short&#13;
distances compared with some of The Gambian Strange Farmers from Upper River.&#13;
Approximately 60 percent of the Senegalese were Wolofs but the&#13;
other important group of migrants from Sine Saloum were Serer, who in the&#13;
past have shown little evidence of mobility either within Senegal or else-&#13;
where. The usual explanation given is that the Serer, compared with the&#13;
Wolof, are much more attached to their land and practice a careful and&#13;
intensive form of mixed farming. Apart from the data derived from the Strange&#13;
Farmer Survey, there is other evidence that the Serer are tending to migrate&#13;
over wider areas; this may partly result from land shortages created by the&#13;
introduction of light mechanization during the last 10 years (Elkan, 1976).&#13;
It would seem that the movement of Wolof and Serer into The Gambia&#13;
during the wet season for the cultivation of groundnuts is something of an&#13;
escape from the long cultivated and highly-populated groundnut areas of&#13;
Sine Saloum. But in addition to a movement from the rural areas of Sene-&#13;
gal, it was noticeable that a significant proportion of Senegalese derived&#13;
from urban areas. Urban concentrations are much more developed in Western&#13;
Senegal than in The Gambia, and collectively in order of importance Kaolack,&#13;
Tambacounda, Thies, and Diourbel provided 25 percent of all Senegalese mi-&#13;
grants. It may be argued that it is not only the pressures of the over-&#13;
worked and densely-populated farmlands which precipitates migration, but&#13;
also the shortage of employment opportunities within the towns during the&#13;
wet season.&#13;
The second important source area of Senegalese migrants was observed&#13;
in the Casamance valley to the south of The Gambia, centered on the towns&#13;
of Sedhiou, Bignona and Ziguinchor. These regions produced 40 percent of&#13;
Senegalese Strange Farmers, the majority of them Jola who moved into the&#13;
Western Division of The Gambia, which is the northern fringe of Jola terri-&#13;
tory centered on the Casamance valley. These migrants came from one of the&#13;
most fertile regions of Senegal, where per capita farm incomes are among&#13;
the highest in the country. However, there is some suggestion that the&#13;
prices of rice in the Casamance are held down artificially by the govern-&#13;
ment (not an uncommon situation in West Africa), and farmers are receiving&#13;
less than the market would otherwise bear. Also, work in the rice swamps&#13;

is extremely arduous and non-mechanized; consequently, outward migration&#13;
from this area to Dakar is common, although many men and women return in&#13;
the wet season to help with the rice harvest. But the Sample Survey of The&#13;
Gambia also indicated that wet season migration must be occurring into The&#13;
Gambia where prices offered for groundnuts may be relatively more attractive&#13;
compared with those for rice, which must be earned by greater effort in less&#13;
congenial conditions.&#13;
Groundnut cultivation is not unknown in the Casamance and indeed&#13;
this was one of the earliest areas of development. In common with the other&#13;
estuary areas along the Senegambian and Guinean coast, the Casamance attracted&#13;
European traders and was an ideal location for the development of agriculture.&#13;
The traditional rice cultivators, the Jola, were gradually influenced by&#13;
the Mandinka as they expanded southwards from The Gambia; this is reflected&#13;
in the modification of Jola house styles, and their acceptance of Islam.&#13;
But in the present context, of more importance was the transfer of rice cul-&#13;
tivation from men to women, which allowed men to specialize in groundnut&#13;
cultivation on the higher lands of the plateau (Pelissier, 1966).&#13;
The third source area for Senegalese migrants in 1974-75 was around&#13;
Kolda in Upper Casamance, which is another area of penetration by the Man-&#13;
dinka; here, however, we are concerned with the Fula, who were assimilated by&#13;
the Mandinka. Incursions of Fula occurred in the nineteenth century, but&#13;
the effective sedentarization of these people was brought about by their con-&#13;
tact with the Mandinka, leading to the adoption of cropping systems based on&#13;
sorghum, millet, and groundnuts (Pelissier, 1966). The destination of these&#13;
Fula from Upper Casamance was almost exclusively into areas of ethnic and eco-&#13;
nomic similarity in the Fulladu Divisions of MacCarthy Island South and Upper&#13;
River Divisions. In common with the Jola and Manding from Lower Casamance,&#13;
only a small proportion originated in towns compared to the Wolof and Serer&#13;
in Lower River North Bank Division.&#13;
From the above analysis of the Strange Farmer data, it would seem&#13;
that the attraction exercised by The Gambia in the past is just as powerful&#13;
today. Despite the artificiality of the national boundary, The Gambia's&#13;
former status as a British possession and the resulting trading patterns&#13;
have assured its economic separateness from francophone Africa, especially&#13;
as its currency is still linked to sterling. Also, The Gambia's role as&#13;
an economic enclave has been underwritten by a different system of produce&#13;
marketing, which has proved to be a strong attraction for migrant farmers&#13;
from francophone countries. In the colonial era, groundnuts were purchased&#13;
in Senegal on a credit payment system which compared unfavorably with the&#13;
Gambian practice of full cash payment on delivery to the buying station.&#13;
Although these differences have been greatly reduced since 1972, the emer-&#13;
gence of State marketing organizations in Senegal integrated with rural co-&#13;
operatives have produced systems of deferred payments and marketing systems&#13;
which the farmer finds more complex than the direct methods obtaining in The&#13;
Gambia (Schumacher, 1975).&#13;
In the late 1960s, administrative delays in payment to farmers,&#13;
together with credit and rebate payments, led to serious rural discontent.&#13;
The situation was further exacerbated by the drought of 1967 onward and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- G.51 -&#13;
gradual withdrawal of French support mechanisms for Senegalese produce. In&#13;
1970, dissatisfaction eventually took the form of a retreat into subsistence&#13;
agriculture, and threats of further retrenchment were made by the influen-&#13;
tial Mouride brotherhood who produce one-third of the Senegalese groundnut&#13;
crop. Some farmers refused to repay loans of seednuts, while others sold&#13;
an estimated 40-50,000 tons of nuts in The Gambia and Guinea. By 1970, the&#13;
Senegalese crop had fallen to one-half of the record output of 900,000 tons&#13;
of 1965 (Schumacher, 1975).&#13;
After 1970, the Senegalese and Gambian governments made strenuous&#13;
efforts to cooperate over such matters by means of a simultaneous opening&#13;
to the trade season in groundnuts and equivalent producer prices. In 1974-75&#13;
the Gambian price paid to farmers was 310.40 Dalasis (E 79.60 sterling) com-&#13;
pared with 301.00 Dalasis (L 75.25 sterling) in Senegal.    But similar prices&#13;
do not obviate differentials which accrue from the relative purchasing power&#13;
of the Gambian dalasi compared with the CFA franc, a difference which has&#13;
been accelerated by the steady fall in value of sterling during the 1970s.&#13;
The ability to buy more with the Gambian dalasi, combined with the particular&#13;
range of goods available in The Gambia, continues to be a powerful incentive&#13;
for Strange Farmers from Senegal. Furthermore, a useful premium can be ob-&#13;
tained on goods taken back across the border. Thus, the general economic&#13;
milieus obtaining in Senegal and The Gambia are important explanatory vari-&#13;
ables for short distance migration, but also there are powerful attractions&#13;
for longer distance migrants from Mali and Guinea.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. THE MALIANS&#13;
It appeared from the Sample Survey that the principal source areas&#13;
of Malian migrants were aligned along the Dakar-Bamako railway line and&#13;
centered on Bafoulable, Kayes, Kita and Bamako; although there were sub-&#13;
sidiary source areas lying to the south of Bamako and in the region of&#13;
Kenieba, close by the Senegal border (Annex Figure 3). The opening of the&#13;
railway in 1924 gave an enormous boost to migration, drawing men from those&#13;
areas along the line; while, at the same time, the railway was the means of&#13;
diffusing commercial groundnut cultivation into Mali. Ethnically most of&#13;
the migrants counted in the survey were Mandinka and Bambara corresponding&#13;
to the western and eastern sectors of the sending areas.&#13;
At present, groundnut production in Mali is on the order of&#13;
120,000 tons (in shell) which is less than in The Gambia, and the crop is&#13;
concentrated in those areas which in fact produced most Gambia-bound migrants.&#13;
Relative to the coastal areas of Senegambia, the crop is less well-developed&#13;
and the changes in climate and market conditions are reflected in the fluctu-&#13;
ating output. Mali suffers from its landlocked position which gives rise to&#13;
a higher cost of transport to the coast; and this, in turn, is reflected in&#13;
the prices paid to farmers. Transport costs have been the chief reason for&#13;
the limitation of commercial cultivation along the railway line, and produc-&#13;
tion suffered a severe set-back during the dispute with Senegal from 1961 to&#13;
1963 when the rail-link was cut at the Senegal-Mali border (Brasseurd, 1974).&#13;
Conscious of these problems and the obvious attraction of the farm-&#13;
lands of Senegambia, the Malian government mounted "Operation Arachide" in&#13;
1965, which was launched in 1967. New farmlands were cleared, semi-mechanized&#13;
motivation was introduced, complemented by the distribution of fertilizer and&#13;
selected seeds. Farmers were also given free transport for their produce&#13;
to the government buying centers (cf. Senegal). The newly cleared areas&#13;
were located in the circles of Kita, Kolokani, Bamako, Koulikoro, and Banamba.&#13;
Initially some 4-6,000 hectares were cultivated involving 570 villages and&#13;
268,000 people, with an anticipated rise to 103,000 hectares in 1970&#13;
(Brasseurd, 1974). Unfortunately this latter target has not been attained&#13;
because of the disastrous drought in 1969 and 1970, and there has been a&#13;
gradual withdrawal of government support.&#13;
It would seem that despite efforts to correct the economic imbalance&#13;
between the core and the periphery which was so apparent in the colonial era,&#13;
migration still continues toward the coastal fringes. For example, the yield&#13;
of groundnuts obtainable in The Gambia and the prices offered are better than&#13;
in Mali, as well as the range of goods offered those coming to work there who&#13;
wish to take material possessions back home. This is the harsh economic&#13;
reality of the situation, whatever the historic reasons may be for this con-&#13;
dition. Ironically, it is the same areas which benefited from "Operation&#13;
Arachide" which are the chief source areas of Strange Farmers moving into The&#13;
Gambia.&#13;
- G.52 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- G. 53 -&#13;
But the continued movement of Malians in a coastward direction may&#13;
be more than a rural exodus because towns comprised the declared home areas&#13;
of a substantial number (Annex Figure 3). This was especially true of those&#13;
coming from the circle centered on Kayes, which half of the migrants declared&#13;
to be their home town. Those with urban origins from the circles of Kita and&#13;
Bamako accounted for 20 percent and 25 percent of the migrants respectively.&#13;
One corollary to this may be that the government scheme has curtained move-&#13;
ment from the rural areas, while movement from the towns still continues;&#13;
and it would seem that if this is correct, then the urban fraction appears&#13;
to prefer travelling to The Gambia rather than moving into the new farmlands&#13;
developed within Mali.&#13;
These areas along the Dakar-Bamako railway have a long history&#13;
of outward migration and not only into Senegal and The Gambia. Fouquet&#13;
estimated that some 25,000 annually left the circles of Sikasso and Bougouni&#13;
for the Gold Coast and Ivory Coast in the period 1934-1950.   For the same&#13;
period he observed that 60 percent of the navetanes in Senegal came from the&#13;
former French Sudan, especially from the circles of Kita, Bafoulabe, Kayes,&#13;
Nioro du Sahel, Segou, and Bansaro (Fouquet, 1958). As mentioned earlier,&#13;
it was Sine Saloum in Senegal which was the destination of the majority of&#13;
migrants; and in 1950, 45 percent of all navetanes were Bambara, which sug-&#13;
gests by inference the particular importance of the areas around Bamako, Kita,&#13;
and Koulikoro.&#13;
The role of the former French authorities in stimulating migration&#13;
cannot be ignored, but it would appear that migration is sufficiently in-&#13;
stitutionalized for Mali to continue as an important source area of agricul-&#13;
tural migrants working in The Gambia. It is not possible to estimate to what&#13;
extent there has been a reduction in the actual numbers leaving Mali since&#13;
independence, although it would appear that fewer Malians have been observed&#13;
in Senegal. Pollet and Green's study of Nioro du Sahel indicates that fewer&#13;
men were leaving to become navetanes, especially after forced labor had been&#13;
stopped; but this also coincided with the emergence of alternative attrac-&#13;
tions, especially in Dakar and Paris (Pollet and Winter, 1969).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VII. THE GUINEANS&#13;
The Guineans probably form the most homogeneous group of migrants,&#13;
being composed almost entirely of Fulas from the Fouta Djallon. While&#13;
their presence in the Fula areas of Upper River and MacCarthy Island Divi-&#13;
sions was very pronounced, they were the most ubiquitous group of migrants&#13;
in The Gambia (Annex Table 1). On the other hand, sending areas were highly&#13;
concentrated on the circles centered on the towns of Labe, Gaoual, and&#13;
Mamou, with subsidiary areas around Telimine and Pita (Annex Figure 3).&#13;
The number of men who came from the towns was very small (12 percent of the&#13;
total); the principal source areas were the large villages of between 2-3,000&#13;
inhabitants lying within 10 miles of the regional towns. The concentration&#13;
of migrants from the regions of Labe and Gaoual is quite remarkable, and 20&#13;
percent of all Strange Farmers in The Gambia came from these 2 areas. Accord-&#13;
ing to the work of Labouret and Fouquet these were also the same areas which&#13;
sent many navetanes into Senegal in the 1950s (Fouquet, 1958, and Labouret,&#13;
1941).&#13;
The central and northern plateaus of the Foutah Djallon have popu-&#13;
lation densities of over 40 persons per square km (1962), which are relatively&#13;
high by West African standards and for Guinea as a whole (a national average&#13;
of 14 per square kilometer). Perhaps of more significance is the contention&#13;
that dietary levels may be inferior in the Foutah to those found in other&#13;
parts of the country. In the opinion of Suret-Canale, high population den-&#13;
sities combined with low levels of nutrition were the underlying factors in&#13;
this region's role as a producer of navetanes into Senegal and permanent&#13;
migrants into Dakar and Conakry (Suret-Canale, 1970).&#13;
While the farming systems of the Foutah are characterized by pas-&#13;
toralism combined with the cultivation of cassava and upland rice, ground-&#13;
nuts have been cultivated in Guinea for a long time, especially in the&#13;
Rivieres du Sud. Domestic production is on the order of 22,000 tons per&#13;
annum and comes from the areas of lighter sandy soil on the north-western&#13;
plains fringing the Foutah plateau around Koumbia and Koundara. This area&#13;
was traditionally occupied by the Diahanke, but subsequently it was colonized&#13;
by the Fula from the higher plateau of the Foutah. Here there are crop ro-&#13;
tations of sorghum, millet, beans, and groundnuts, which are similar to&#13;
those found in Senegal and The Gambia. Suret-Canale describes how the Fula&#13;
used to come down from the plateau to the plains in the wet season to culti-&#13;
vate groundnuts, which have gradually been replaced by rice cultivation.&#13;
The returns of the Strange Farmer Survey indicated that the Fula&#13;
still continue to travel further afield to cultivate groundnuts, but as&#13;
has been argued before, The Gambia has special attractions for migrants and&#13;
two in particular may be noted. First, the Fulladu districts of The Gambia&#13;
have been receiving Fulas from the Foutah Djallon for the past 150 years,&#13;
and this drift continues and is facilitated by the Strange Farmer system.&#13;
Second, over the past 20 years the Guinean economy has suffered from increas-&#13;
ing isolation, which has meant import control and non-negotiabie currency,&#13;
- G.54 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- G. 55 -&#13;
leading to an exodus of Guineans both seasonally and permanently into Senegal&#13;
and Gambia to the north, and into Sierra Leone to the south. The strict&#13;
border controls in recent years have done little to check movements; they&#13;
have merely made them more clandestine.&#13;
The former colonial regime made attempts to check outward migra-&#13;
tion by the development of commercial groundnut schemes in the north-west,&#13;
especially in the Arrondisements of Koumbia and Foulamong. Decorticaters&#13;
were set up at Koundara and Koumbia and an export of 6,553 tons was achieved&#13;
in 1954, which fell to 2,090 tons in 1956. The groundnuts were exported&#13;
via Senegal through the agency of Senegalese merchants. After Independence&#13;
in 1958 the Three-Year Plan sought to expand production, but failed with&#13;
what may be described as a small-scale virgin-land scheme. A target was&#13;
set of 32,500 tons and colonization of the Pite - Labe area was undertaken&#13;
by ex-navetanes, thus trying to stem the coastward movements by a counter-&#13;
development of the interior. In essence, the program was aimed at replac-&#13;
ing seasonal migration by organized settlement and commercial farming.&#13;
The groundnut scheme was not helped by the withdrawal of French&#13;
help after 1958 and the gradual isolation of the Guinean economy, but in&#13;
addition the Guinean government failed to understand the Strange Farmer&#13;
system. Whereas the host traditionally provides tools and seeds, the gov-&#13;
ernment provided neither. Furthermore, the export of groundnuts had to be&#13;
via Conakry which proved difficult as the railway line lies well to the south&#13;
of the Gaoual - Labe area, and parts of the line gradually became derelict&#13;
as foreign currency became so short that it could not be repaired. By 1961&#13;
exports had reached 8,000 tons, but dropped to 2,000 tons in 1962, which was&#13;
the same amount as was produced in 1956. The latest figures available are&#13;
for 1966 when 1,800 tons were exported, 780 tons of which came from the Koun-&#13;
dara region.&#13;
Prices paid to farmers have been less than satisfactory, even allow-&#13;
ing for the purchasing power of money in Guinea and the range of goods avail-&#13;
able compared with Senegal and Gambia. Subsequently, rice has proved to be&#13;
a more attractive crop for colonists, cultivation is mechanized with the&#13;
help of government agencies, the work is less arduous compared with the&#13;
cultivation of groundnuts, and the prices paid by the government and those&#13;
offered in the local markets are superior to those for groundnuts. It is&#13;
interesting to note that this is the opposite situation to that obtaining in&#13;
the Casamance region of Senegal. Finally, the results of the Strange Farmer&#13;
Survey showed that as in Mali, the most important source areas for Guinean&#13;
migrants were those same areas where attempts were made to stimulate ground-&#13;
nut production by both the colonial government and its successors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VIII. SEASONAL, PERIODIC, AND PERMANENT MIGRATION&#13;
The discussion so far has centered on the declared origins of&#13;
Strange Farmers and has assumed that they are perfect seasonals--that is,&#13;
they return to their homelands for the dry season after 7 months of farming.&#13;
But both the French and English literary sources indicate the occurrence&#13;
of extended stays in the groundnut areas comprising 2 or more wet seasons&#13;
(periodic migrants), together with repeat seasonal migration when the in-&#13;
tervening dry season has been spent at home. The importance of seasonal&#13;
and periodic migration is that it may be the means whereby permanent settle-&#13;
ment occurs by both Gambian and non-Gambians. The Strange Farmer system is&#13;
an ideal mechanism for settlement since the migrant is housed and fed dur-&#13;
ing the wet season by his host, and then, after selling his crop, has cash&#13;
in hand for the following dry season. In some cases, repeat migration may&#13;
lead to marriage into a household with which the migrant has become familiar,&#13;
and until such time as he is given land and builds his own compound, he can&#13;
continue as a Strange Farmer.&#13;
The Strange Farmer Survey looked into these possibilities, although&#13;
on a limited scale. Time and financial constraints precluded extended work&#13;
on migrant histories, but it was possible to inquire where the migrant spent&#13;
the previous dry season of 1973-74 and the previous wet season of 1973. A&#13;
complementary question was asked about how he had been employed during these&#13;
periods, for it seemed reasonable to argue that the economic niche a man had&#13;
previously occupied was of some significance in looking at why he became a&#13;
migrant farmer.&#13;
The analysis of the whereabouts of strangers before they arrived in&#13;
their villages of enumeration is shown in Annex Table 2. Because of the com-&#13;
plex array of places, the geographic locations of migrants have been cate-&#13;
gorized as "within the home country", "within a Gambian town", "within a&#13;
Gambian village", "already in the village of enumeration", and finally, "in&#13;
some other country". The results of this analysis are remarkable and demon-&#13;
strate the care needed in dealing with migration data, especially when there&#13;
is no information about intervening moves between homeland and destination.&#13;
In particular these data reveal that many non-Gambians could be classed as&#13;
internal migrants.&#13;
Of the 756 non-Gambians in the Sample (equivalent to 24,000), just&#13;
over half of them had been away from their home areas in the dry season of&#13;
1973-74 before becoming Strange Farmers for the 1974 wet season. Further-&#13;
more, the majority of these men were already in The Gambia, distributed among&#13;
the villages and towns, while some were already in their villages of enumera-&#13;
tion (Annex Table 2). Of those in towns, not surprisingly most were in&#13;
Banjul, while those in urban areas in some other countries (which effectively&#13;
meant Senegal) were concentrated in Dakar. In all, some 28 percent of those&#13;
away from home in the dry season were in urban areas, and this demonstrated&#13;
once again that some migrants were leaving the towns to farm, although in this&#13;
case they were not their home towns, but ones into which they had migrated. A&#13;
summation of the dry season locations of non-Gambians is given in the map in&#13;
Annex Figure 4, which presents a striking contrast to that in Annex Figure 3,&#13;
where the same migrants are plotted according to their declared home areas.&#13;

- G.59 -&#13;
When the data on the previous locations of non-Gambians are broken&#13;
down by national groups, there are discernible variations, but notably in&#13;
the case of the Senegalese. While the Senegalese may have been away from&#13;
home either in their own country or in The Gambia during the 1973-74 dry&#13;
season, there is no evidence of them migrating further afield. On the other&#13;
hand, Malians and Guineans were to be found in Senegal prior to their moving&#13;
on to The Gambia for the 1974 wet season. Reference to the data in Annex&#13;
Table 2 also shows how many migrants had farmed away from home during the&#13;
previous wet season of 1973. Of the 40 percent who had spent the 1973-74&#13;
dry season in The Gambia, three-quarters had also been there in the previous&#13;
wet season. Therefore, a strand of periodic migrants had been in The Gambia&#13;
continuously since the wet season of 1973, and they comprised 28 percent of&#13;
all non-Gambian Strange Farmers enumerated in the survey. To these periodic&#13;
migrants can be added those who were seasonal repeat migrants, that is those&#13;
who spent the intervening dry season at home or elsewhere; they accounted&#13;
for 8 percent of all non-Gambian migrants. Thus it would appear that ex-&#13;
tended or periodic stays within The Gambia are much more important than re-&#13;
peated movements by Strange Farmers between their homelands and The Gambia&#13;
each farming season. One small addendum to this conclusion is that the data&#13;
show seasonal movements were noticeably higher for the Senegalese, which is&#13;
a function of the much shorter distances between their homelands and the&#13;
Gambian groundnut area.&#13;
With respect to Gambian Strange Farmers, 53 percent were away from&#13;
home during the 1973-74 dry season, an almost identical proportion to non-&#13;
Gambians. The vast majority of these men were in The Gambia, where they&#13;
had a greater concentration in towns than their foreign counterparts (55&#13;
percent compared with 28 percent). This greater urban commitment is indi-&#13;
cative of a general movement of Gambians into the towns with the beginning&#13;
of the trade season, when they try to supplement their earnings as wet&#13;
season farmers. A relatively small proportion of the Gambians in the sample&#13;
of Strange Farmers found jobs outside their home country, and those who did&#13;
were almost exclusively in Dakar. As might be expected, the number of Gam-&#13;
bian farmers who were away from home both in the previous dry and wet seasons&#13;
was much smaller than for non-Gambians--one-fifth, compared with three-&#13;
quarters. The inference is that, while non-Gambians spend extended periods&#13;
in The Gambia, Gambians indulge more in repeated seasonal movements between&#13;
home village or town, and locations where they become wet season groundnut&#13;
farmers.&#13;
But if many Strange Farmers had been away for more than one dry&#13;
season (especially non-Gambians), what had they been doing in the dry sea-&#13;
son prior to becoming groundnut cultivators? The short answer is that they&#13;
were involved in a variety of occupations whereby they integrated dry sea-&#13;
son employment with wet-season farming. Off-farm employment in the dry sea-&#13;
son is commonplace in West Africa, and this usually involves some form of&#13;
migration. In the present case many migrants were alternating between farm&#13;
and factory, or town and countryside after an initial move from their home&#13;
areas where they might have been either urban or rural dwellers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- G. 60 -&#13;
Inasmuch as the Strange Farmer system is an ideal mechanism for&#13;
settlement, it also possesses many advantages for maximizing opportunities&#13;
for income formation. Only a short season of farming groundnuts produces&#13;
quick cash-returns followed by a dry season in which additional job oppor-&#13;
tunities may be available. The quickening of economic activity in Senegam-&#13;
bia with the commencement of the trade season is very apparent, and there is&#13;
a marked up-swing in the prospects of employment in both the formal and in-&#13;
formal sectors. Thus, the initial attraction of strange-farming is further&#13;
heightened for many men (especially from Guinea and Mali) by the prospect of&#13;
a dual occupation. The returns from the Strange Farmer Survey showed the&#13;
range of dry season activities and occupations to be considerable, but for the&#13;
purpose of the present analysis they have been reduced to a simple six-fold&#13;
classification.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IL   DRY SEASON ACTIVITIES, 1973-74&#13;
The 1973-74 dry season activities of migrants working away from&#13;
home are shown in Annex Table 3 where they are classified into 6 groups.&#13;
Firstly, there were those engaged in the formal sector--that is, in regular&#13;
wage-earning employment--which comprised 26 percent of dry season activities&#13;
(Group A). 1/ In most West African countries, the number of wage-earning&#13;
opportunities are limited and generally confined to the governmental sec-&#13;
tor; for example, in 1974 some 80 percent of wage-earners in The Gambia were&#13;
employed in the government or quasi-government sector (The Gambia, 1974).&#13;
Wage-earners in the survey were commonly involved in dockwork, where demands&#13;
for seasonal labor are high at the beginning of the trade season in ground-&#13;
nuts. Road and well-repairing undertaken by the Public Works Department were&#13;
other dry season activities. But, the single most important job category&#13;
for wage-earners was in the groundnut mills, the chief processing industry&#13;
of The Gambia, where 90 percent of exports by value derive from groundnuts.&#13;
There are two mill and groundnut-press complexes, one mid-way up-river at&#13;
Kaur and the larger one at Denton Bridge on the outskirts of Banjul. In addi-&#13;
tion, there are some 88 buying and loading depots distributed along the river.&#13;
It is possible to make an estimate of the average financial rewards&#13;
for those combining groundnut farming with employment in the formal sector,&#13;
since the basic wage rates in the latter are fixed by the government. The&#13;
daily rate for laborers in 1974 was 2.05 dalasis (E 0.51) which, assuming&#13;
a work period of 4 months in the dry season of 1973-74, would have given an&#13;
average income of 212 dalasis (E 53). Combined with an average income from&#13;
groundnut farming of 240 dalasis (E 60), this would have yielded a total&#13;
annual income of 440 dalasis (E 110). Compared with farming at home, espe-&#13;
cially in Guinea or Mali, migration as a Strange Farmer and factory worker&#13;
would seem to afford considerable attraction as a means of satisfying either&#13;
short-term needs, especially for consumer goods, or of producing capital which&#13;
might be invested back home.&#13;
Another important area of dry season employment was in the informal&#13;
sector, comprising petty trading, sewing, tailoring, baking, building, and&#13;
taxi and lorry-driving (Group B). Overall, this was the most important group&#13;
of dry season pursuits, accounting for one-third of those spending the dry&#13;
season away from home. This category included a group of men whose motives&#13;
for farming were overtly stated as the need to acquire money for business,&#13;
for example for trading stock, or to purchase equipment such as sewing&#13;
machines. But the small number of migrants who specifically expressed this&#13;
motive formed the nucleus of a much larger group engaged in business acti-&#13;
vities in the informal sector. Unfortunately, it was not possible to esti-&#13;
mate the earnings of these workers, but there is no doubt that they will show&#13;
considerable variation compared with the formal sector.&#13;
1/   The formal sector refers to large-scale enterprises, either foreign or&#13;
government financed, operated by salaried and wage-paid labour. The&#13;
informal sector refers to small-scale indigenous enterprises financed&#13;
by local capital (See Hart, 1970).&#13;

The participation of the principal national groups in the formal&#13;
sector showed some interesting variations, but it was apparent that all of&#13;
them were primarily working in The Gambia compared with other possible loca-&#13;
tions. Among the non-Gambians, the Malians and Guineans were particularly&#13;
conspicious in the formal sector; and if one takes account of the relative&#13;
numbers of migrants from these two countries, it is the Malians who assume the&#13;
greatest significance. Detailed examination of the data showed them to have&#13;
been the major element in the work force at the groundnut mills and buying sta-&#13;
tions. Since the Malians come from long distances, which have to be covered&#13;
by road or rail, this additional time spent working in factories no doubt de-&#13;
frays expenses, as well as being an extra premium to that which they already&#13;
enjoy by farming groundnuts in The Gambia. In addition, opportunities for&#13;
wage employment in Mali are severely limited.&#13;
The other important element in formal sector employment is The&#13;
Gambian. The presence of Gambians in this sector is not only important in&#13;
terms of their overall dry season activities (which is the case with the&#13;
Malians), but also Gambians form the largest element in the formal sector if&#13;
classified according to nationality of employees. The movement of Gambians&#13;
into towns in the dry season has been referred to above and is now underlined&#13;
by the data in Annex Table 3, but this is a dry season movement of longstand-&#13;
ing and reaches back into the nineteenth century (Reports showing the Present&#13;
State of Her Majesty's Colonial Possessions, 1870).&#13;
Small-scale businesses in common with the formal sector (such as the&#13;
docks and commerical houses) experience a severe curtailment of trade during&#13;
the wet season. After the groundnut trade season begins in late December,&#13;
there is a tremendous upswing in business as cash becomes available. Even&#13;
the most casual observer in towns such as Banjul, Basse, Dakar and at the&#13;
river crossings cannot fail to observe the stocking of shops and the incursion&#13;
of traders, who may come from as far away as Mauritania. In Basse, most shops&#13;
are removed to the wharf side, where they are joined by a variety of petty&#13;
traders at a point where economic activity is maximized. Thus, for many&#13;
Strange Farmers there is a seasonal interchange between trading or small busi-&#13;
ness activities which form a complement to wet season farming for groundnuts.&#13;
Of the non-Gambians involved in the informal sector the dominant&#13;
element was Guinean, both in absolute terms and proportionate to their pre-&#13;
sence as Strange Farmers (Annex Table 3). The majority of Guineans were Fulas&#13;
from the Fouta Djallon who have a penchant for trading, which is not the&#13;
easiest of occupations in the present economic circumstances of Guinea. Also,&#13;
the Fula have become increasingly isolated politically within Guinea and&#13;
have for a long period been moving into Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast,&#13;
and Senegal. The Gambians were also well represented in the informal sector&#13;
and, although they did not assume overall superiority as in the case of the&#13;
formal sector, nonetheless among the Gambian group, informal sector activi-&#13;
ties were the most important category. The accumulation of cash from the&#13;
sale of groundnuts affords the opportunity to invest in stock for petty trad-&#13;
ing, or to purchase equipment to engage in small-scale manufacturing, and&#13;
move into the towns or to the ferry crossings where income opportunities can&#13;
be maximized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- G. 64 -&#13;
Formal and informal sector employment accounted for 60 percent of&#13;
migrant dry season activities, which demonstrated the importance of off-farm&#13;
employment in the dry season. These dry season workers, especially in the in-&#13;
formal sector, were producing manufactured goods and providing services as&#13;
well as distributing imported goods, which it has been argued represents a&#13;
specialist substitution of goods and services formerly produced within the&#13;
agricultural community or household (Hymer and Resnick, 1969). In particular,&#13;
the increased incomes from cash-crop farming have led to a greater use of&#13;
imported cloth which is made into clothing by local tailors. In turn, the&#13;
tailors buy imported sewing machines which comprise the principal capital in-&#13;
vestment associated with their business.&#13;
The third group of dry season activities concerned those who were&#13;
involved in agriculture or fishing (Annex Table 3).   If the former seems a&#13;
curious occupation for the dry season migrant, closer inquiry showed that&#13;
many Strange Farmers, especially non-Gambians, spent the dry season doing&#13;
what can be termed compound work, that is repairing and re-building fences,&#13;
storage huts, and houses. Such work may be found almost anywhere in Sene-&#13;
gambia, but the majority of men in this category stayed with their hosts of&#13;
the previous wet season before beginning work again with them as Strange&#13;
Farmers. In other words, they were "working their passage" from one wet&#13;
season to the next without having to move. This kind of work is subject to&#13;
greater variation in the mode of payment than other categories, and frequently&#13;
is in the form of payment in kind. Its most important aspect is that it rep-&#13;
resents a close attachment to the host and often indicates the migrant is&#13;
in the process of settling within a village. Other categories of dry season&#13;
activities comprised those engaged in education (Group D), those involved in&#13;
miscellaneous activities (Group E), and finally those who were inactive&#13;
(Group 0). The majority of this latter group in common with those engaged&#13;
in compound work (Group C) were to be found with the hosts for whom they&#13;
were to work in the 1974 wet season and with whom they had been in the pre-&#13;
vious wet season of 1973.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
X. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
The emergence of longer stay or periodic migrants from Senegal,&#13;
Mali, and Guinea raises the question of permanent settlement, which is the&#13;
concern of both the sending and receiving areas. The migration histories&#13;
examined above are of a very brief kind, but in addition Strange Farmers&#13;
were asked whether they were intending to settle in The Gambia. This ques-&#13;
tion produced an unexpectedly good response, and it was interesting to see&#13;
how many men who could be described as periodic or repeat migrants expressed&#13;
a desire to settle. Of the 210 non-Gambians farming in 1974 who had been&#13;
in The Gambia in 1973, 173 stated that they wished to settle, which, together&#13;
with a few other first-time migrants with a similar intention, amounted to&#13;
24 percent of those interviewed.&#13;
The observed patterns of movement into and within The Gambia sug-&#13;
gested that the Strange Farmer system might be a means of transitional mo-&#13;
bility, whereby repeated movements for farming subsequently combined with&#13;
other forms of employment leading to permanent settlement. This transi-&#13;
tional mobility can be expressed in the following stages, all of which are&#13;
discernible within the Strange Farmer population at any one moment of time.&#13;
Stage I is represented by occasional seasonal movements to work as a Strange&#13;
Farmer; Stage II, repeated visits with the intervening season back home;&#13;
Stage III, prolonged stays of wet season farming integrated with dry season&#13;
employment; Stage IV, extended stays of a semi-permanent or permanent kind&#13;
(Annex Figure 5). This kind of transitional mobility is the means whereby&#13;
Senegalese, Malians, and Guineans gradually shift their centers of gravity&#13;
from their homelands into The Gambia, although ultimately they may return home&#13;
with advancing age. In the case of Gambian Strange Farmers, the same process&#13;
may be used to shift their residences into the orbit of the capital, Banjul.&#13;
Attitudes toward labor migration vary enormously, and much depends&#13;
on one's ideological or economic commitment, as well as one's status and role.&#13;
From the migrant's point of view, in the short-run the Strange Farmer system&#13;
can bring tangible benefits, despite the social disruption entailed and the&#13;
fact that returns to their labor are less than they should be due to the&#13;
workings of the overseas commodity markets and marketing organizations. In&#13;
addition, in the short term, the usefulness of the migrant labor to the host&#13;
farmer may be real, although this has not been examined here.&#13;
The governments concerned may have a different perspective toward&#13;
labor migration based on the longer term and their management of the economy.&#13;
At the moment, it would seem that attempts to stem the tide of migrants into&#13;
the Senegambian groundnut areas, and into The Gambia in particular have not&#13;
been particularly successful. The harsh reality is that in both Guinea and&#13;
Mali, there has been a failure to diversify the economy in such a way as to&#13;
retain the manpower now diverted to migrant farming. It is true that the&#13;
natural environment can impose severe constraints, but of greater importance&#13;
is the effect of the political fragmentation of West Africa. What does seem&#13;
apparent is that unless the social and economic circumstances of the sending&#13;
and receiving areas alter radically, the migratory labor system will continue.&#13;

            This working paper brings together
            country-level analyses of the demographic aspects of
            migration in English-speaking West Africa. They are written
            by Bank staff and consultants under the overall direction of
            K. C. Zachariah. Eight country studies, including 2 annexes,
            have been prepared on West Africa migration and are issued
            in two volumes. Each country analysis focuses on the volume
            and direction of external and internal migration in that
            country and the demographic and socioeconomic
            characteristics of migrants and non-migrants. These data
            yield insights concerning population distribution and the
            effects of migration on population growth. They also provide
            the background data necessary for further analysis of the
            economic consequences of migration in the region, a study
            which is now being initiated by West African scholars as a
            follow-up to these country studies.
