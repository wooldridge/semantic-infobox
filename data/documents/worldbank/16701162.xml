    sector issues. The study builds&#13;
    on a previous study conducted by&#13;
    WSP-Africa in 2003. The research       Figure 1. Summary of performance integrating WSS into the PRSP process&#13;
    highlighted a few key lessons:&#13;
    firstly, it is the context in which&#13;
    the PRSP is developed, rather than                                  WSS in Poverty            WSS Sector                     WSS Sector               WSS M&amp;E&#13;
                                                                        Diagnostic                Reform                         Finance&#13;
    the PRSP document itself, that&#13;
    most strongly influences whether&#13;
    a country, province, or community&#13;
    will be successful in implementing&#13;
    sustainable activities to improve&#13;
    water, sanitation, and hygiene.&#13;
    Secondly, while the PRSP itself&#13;
    does not seem to drive change, the&#13;
    PRSP process can help to bridge&#13;
    sector planning with broader&#13;
    macro-economic and budgeting&#13;
    decisions by government. Finally,&#13;
    it should be noted that those&#13;
    countries that were early adopters&#13;
                                              Uganda   Senegal   Tanzania     Zambia                                       Mozambique   Kenya&#13;
                                                                                         Benin   Burkina Faso   Ethiopia                        Rwanda Mauritania Malawi&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in poverty
            reduction strategy papers (PRSP) : benchmarking performance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers
            (PRSPs) are policy instruments designed to mainstream
            poverty into national planning frameworks. This study sought
            to benchmark how different countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
            incorporate water supply and sanitation (WSS) into the PRSP
            process, with additional research into broader sector
            issues. The study builds on a previous study conducted by
            WSP-Africa in 2003. The research highlighted a few key
            lessons: firstly, it is the context in which the PRSP is
            developed, rather than the PRSP document itself, that most
            strongly influences whether a country, province, or
            community will be successful in implementing sustainable
            activities to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene.
            Secondly, while the PRSP itself does not seem to drive
            change, the PRSP process can help to bridge sector planning
            with broader macro-economic and budgeting decisions by
            government. Finally, it should be noted that those countries
            that were early adopters of incorporating WSS in their PRSPs
            continue to strengthen their strategic planning process.
