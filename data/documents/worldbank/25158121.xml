&#13;
Measuring poverty in Africa remains a challenge.&#13;
  The coverage, comparability, and quality of household surveys to monitor living standards&#13;
â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130;&amp;#7;&#13;
  have improved. Still, in 2012, only 25 of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s 48 countries had conducted at least two&#13;
  surveys over the past decade to track poverty.&#13;
  Regular and good quality GDP, price, and census data are also lacking.&#13;
â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130;&amp;#7;&#13;
  Technical approaches can fill in some gaps, but there is no good alternative to regular and&#13;
â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130;&amp;#7;&#13;
  good quality data. A regionwide effort to strengthen Africaâ&#128;&#153;s statistics is called for.&#13;
&#13;
Poverty in Africa may be lower than current estimates suggest,&#13;
but more people are poor today than in 1990.&#13;
  T he share of Africans who are poor fell from 56 percent in 1990 to 43 percent in 2012.&#13;
â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130;&amp;#7;&#13;
  Limiting estimates to comparable surveys, drawing on nonconsumption surveys, and apply-&#13;
  ing alternative price deflators suggest that poverty may have declined by even more.&#13;
  Nonetheless, even given the most optimistic estimates, still many more people are poor, due&#13;
â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130;&amp;#7;&#13;
  to population growth: more than 330 million in 2012, up from about 280 million in 1990.&#13;

  The data do not reveal a systematic increase in inequality across countries in Africa. But these&#13;

  Spatial inequalities (differences between urban and rural areas and across regions) are large.&#13;

                   The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint. In&#13;
                   support of this commitment, the Publishing and Knowledge Division leverages&#13;
                   electronic publishing options and print-on-demand technology, which is located&#13;
                   in regional hubs worldwide. Together, these initiatives enable print runs to be&#13;
                   lowered and shipping distances decreased, resulting in reduced paper consump-&#13;
                   tion, chemical use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.&#13;
                      The Publishing and Knowledge Division follows the recommended standards&#13;
                   for paper use set by the Green Press Initiative. The majority of our books are&#13;
                   printed on Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)â&#128;&#147;certified paper, with nearly all con-&#13;

            Poverty in a rising Africa : overview
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Poverty in a Rising Africa discusses the
            data challenges faced when measuring poverty and inequality
            in Africa. The report also systematically reviews the
            measures of poverty and inequality in both monetary and
            nonmonetary dimensions. Major points discussed in the report
            include: 1) measuring poverty in Africa remains a challenge;
            2) poverty in Africa may be lower than current estimates
            suggest, but more people are poor today than in 1990; 3)
            nonmonetary dimensions of poverty have been improving;  and
            4) inequality in Africa has many dimensions. Many findings
            are encouraging, but many challenges remain.
