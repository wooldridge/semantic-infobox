ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper reviews the recent experience of strategic planning&#13;
and management in large institutions, primarily in the private sector. The&#13;
main conclusions are:&#13;
l.   Planning practices have undergone fundamental transformation in&#13;
response to accelerated changes in the complexity of&#13;
institutions, the diversity of their businesses, and the&#13;
uncertainty and competitiveness of their environment.&#13;
2.   Planning has evolved from a preoccupation with financial&#13;
controls, forecasting and formal planning processes towards&#13;
increasing emphasis on understanding the external environment and&#13;
competitors, providing a strategic framework for resource&#13;
allocation, and integrating the strategies, structures, systems,&#13;
skills and values of an institution to fulfill a clearly defined&#13;
mission.&#13;
3.   Strategic planning practices have employed various tools to&#13;
promote environmental analysis, differentiate among market&#13;
segments, and formulate a hierarchy of strategies for corporate,&#13;
business and functional levels. In general, strategic planning&#13;
has introduced a discipline for coherent thinking about the long&#13;
term and uncertainties and raised awareness of the threats and&#13;
opportunities arising from competitors and environmental changes.&#13;
4.   Strategic management has emerged as the latest form of planning&#13;
in response to tendencies towards bureaucratization and&#13;
centralization of the strategic planning function. Strategic&#13;
management emphasizes an ongoing strategy management process,&#13;
widespread creative thinking, and the integration of strategy&#13;
formulation processes with other management structures and&#13;
systems. It employs a planning process that is outward-&#13;
oriented, issue-focussed, creative, selective, opportunity&#13;
seeking and highly interactive. It emphasizes leadership,&#13;
delegation within a strategic framework, and line management&#13;
ownership of strategy development and implementation. Staff&#13;
planners act as facilitators, catalysts, counselors and&#13;
stimulators to the line manager, who must be the strategist.&#13;
Strategic managers bridge the gap between planning and&#13;
implementation by addressing implementation early and often, by&#13;
involving key players at early stages, by experimentation, and by&#13;
conscious management of resistance to change.&#13;

Strategic Planning and Management&#13;
A Review of Recent Experience&#13;
I. OVERVIEW&#13;
Management practices, particularly at the executive level and in&#13;
the private sector are undergoing substantial changes in response to&#13;
fundamental environmental changes. Organizations have to respond to new&#13;
levels of global competition and economic restructuring, market shifts,&#13;
increasing uncertainties and an accelerated pace of change. Technological&#13;
and institutional innovations have made finance, physical resources and&#13;
finished goods more mobile than ever. The world is becoming a highly&#13;
interdependent and competitive marketplace. The pace of technological&#13;
change has also accelerated and contributed to the dynamics of a world&#13;
market with substantial and frequent shifts in competitive advantage. In&#13;
the corporate world, extremely diversified, complex and global&#13;
organizations have emerged. Also industries are becoming more knowledge-&#13;
based and skill-intensive. The "knowledge worker" has become the dominant&#13;
labor force in industrial countries. Public service institutions are&#13;
facing similar environmental challenges as they support social changes that&#13;
must accompany economic change. They have to exhibit new levels of&#13;
flexibility and selectivity. They are learning to respond quickly and&#13;
effectively to diverse needs and clients in full recognition of their&#13;
specific comparative advantages and of those of other actors in the&#13;
environment.&#13;
A previous era was characterized by stability, continuity, and&#13;
predictable growth. That era was governed by the logic of large scale&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
production: standarized rules, centralized authority, machine-like&#13;
organizations, predictable demand and given ends. The management's&#13;
attention to internal efficiencies had as its premises growing demand,&#13;
steady supply of resources, and the consensus of stakeholders on the&#13;
mission (businesses) of the institution. Slow adaptation, gradual&#13;
evolution, production and efficiency-orientation, and forecast-based&#13;
planning were then perhaps the adequate modes of response for growth and&#13;
survival.&#13;
With the emergence of the present era of uncertainty and&#13;
turbulence, prediction became impossible and strategic adaptation had to&#13;
replace the stable rules of slow evolution. New productive organizations&#13;
are emerging with flexible systems of production, outward-looking and&#13;
customer-focused cultures, less hierarchical structures, and learning-&#13;
oriented processes of planning and decision making. There is also a&#13;
growing evidence that corporations are increasingly adopting and adapting&#13;
technologies and know-how created by others; more emphasis is given to&#13;
screen the environment for information and to gain competitive advantage&#13;
through strategic partnership with external sources of knowledge and&#13;
innovation. The new era requires a new form of management that fosters&#13;
strategic thinking and behaviour, influences the external environment, and&#13;
organizes feedback from clients and stakeholders. More than ever before,&#13;
top management has to focus on setting and communicating clear directions,&#13;
generating broad-based consensus and commitments about adjustments, and&#13;
engaging all employees in continuous learning and the constant improvement&#13;
of the entire organization. In this context, planning becomes a critical&#13;
tool for top and line management to facilitate rapid and active adjustment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
to define and build upon competitive advantage, to concentrate resources on&#13;
the highest payoffs and the future, and to enhance the management of&#13;
change.&#13;
This paper identifies the major steps in the evolution of&#13;
planning, to the present state of "strategic management'. Its objective is&#13;
to clarify the basic concepts and components underlying the recent&#13;
experiences and practices of leading corporations in strategic planning and&#13;
strategic management. The paper draws on the experience of 90&#13;
organizations that have been surveyed through direct interviews with&#13;
strategic planning managers and selected executives and consulting firms&#13;
(see Table 1, page 51, otl summary of findings and Annex I on methodology of&#13;
the survey). Although most of these organizations were selected from the&#13;
private sector, where most of the innovations in planning practices have&#13;
occurred, this paper emphasizes those concepts and practices that are&#13;
essential to the effectiveness of both public and private organizations,&#13;
including public and professional "services" organiszations.&#13;
The most important and recent trends in the strategic planning&#13;
process emphasize:&#13;
Ownership: line managers must see strategy formulation and&#13;
implementation as their business; strategy setting must be&#13;
restored to be the core of line management responsibility. "The&#13;
notion that an effective strategy can be constructed by someone&#13;
in an ivory tower is bankrupt". Top management, in particular,&#13;
support and drive the strategic planning process as its tool for&#13;
executive management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
External orientation:  strategy must be born out of close&#13;
relations with and sensitivity to customer needs and market&#13;
shifts.&#13;
Implementability:  the credibility of planning will erode to the&#13;
extent plans do not get implemented effectively; changing the&#13;
capability of organizations to manage new strategies and postures&#13;
is at the heart of strategic planning.&#13;
*   Agility:  the planning process must be informed but not enslaved&#13;
by analysis and bureaucratic routines; it must be flexible,&#13;
responsive, and selective (rather than calendar-driven,&#13;
formalistic and comprehensive). It should enhance understanding,&#13;
creative thinking, and experimentation. There must be a&#13;
fundamental change in the nature of planning from an exercise in&#13;
forecasting to an exercise in creative choice.&#13;
Add Value:  planners and planning systems must be seen to&#13;
contribute directly to improved decision making and strategy&#13;
implementation.&#13;
These changes in planning practices are congruent with and&#13;
reinforced by other changes in management practices. These transformations&#13;
emphasize:&#13;
Leadership:  top management must lead organizational change.  The&#13;
keys to managing change are (1) a clear mission; (2) well thought&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
out and clearly communicated strategies; (3) top management&#13;
drive; and (4) bold implementation actions. The closer managers&#13;
are to the point where the product is made or the service is&#13;
delivered, the more important is the capacity to clarify purpose,&#13;
to inspire people with its importance, and to meet their&#13;
requirements and expectations. To fulfill their role, senior&#13;
managers should be active communicators and motivators and should&#13;
infuse their organization with vision and purpose'/.&#13;
Culture Management: a key to effective organizational&#13;
performance and strategic adaptation is to develop a&#13;
consciousness of the organization's character, of the limitations&#13;
and possibilities derived from its history, and to consciously&#13;
shape this culture both as a resource and a constraint to&#13;
strategic adaptation. The elements of success in "In Search of&#13;
Excellence" are primarily cultural: closeness to the customer,&#13;
bias for action, autonomy and entrepreneurship, etc. Survey&#13;
results indicate that CEOs are assuming their responsibility as&#13;
leaders of the corporate culture and value shapers, rather than&#13;
simply occupying the apex of a multi-layered bureaucratic&#13;
structure.&#13;
1/ This suggests that senior managers should devote significant time and&#13;
effort to communicate and engender a sense of direction and purpose to&#13;
all levels of staff. This may involve managers in open and frequent&#13;
meetings and professional fora with various sections of the&#13;
organization, intensive information campaigns in different media, and&#13;
presenting all staff with themes, visions and clearly defined&#13;
organizational objectives and strategies. This may be referred to as&#13;
"transformational" leadership.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
Stimulating innovation and learning: management must assume&#13;
responsibility for strategizing, for choosing and modifying "what&#13;
business we are in", for developing new competences, for&#13;
validating the choices made, and for energizing the values and&#13;
aspirations of organization members at all levels to sustain&#13;
these choices. At the heart of this process are learning&#13;
organizations and learning persons. There is a resurgence in the&#13;
development of organization capability not only in management&#13;
ranks, but wherever creative contributions to competitive&#13;
advantage can be sparked and developed. This extends beyond&#13;
training and encompasses appropriate incentives, careful career&#13;
planning and placement, decentralization, delegation, an open and&#13;
supportive climate for learning, and the nurturing of teamwork&#13;
and collaborative entrepreneurship. In an environment where&#13;
knowledge and innovation are the cutting edge of competitiveness&#13;
and relevance, managers are expected to empower staff to act on&#13;
their ideas and be rewarded for risk taking and entrepreneurship.&#13;
An integrated approach:  orchestration of strategy, structure,&#13;
systems, staff, skills, style and shared values: organizational&#13;
change and development is not simply a matter of selecting a new&#13;
strategy or organizational structure. Rather, effective&#13;
organizational change is the result of managing mutually&#13;
reinforcing changes in the strategy, structure, systems,&#13;
staffing, skill development, managerial style, and organizational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
culture (shared values)2/. These elements of change management&#13;
are closely interconnected; it is difficult, perhaps impossible,&#13;
to make significant progress in one factor without progress in&#13;
the others as well. The role of top management is to initiate&#13;
mutually reinforcing changes in these factors; a priori, it is&#13;
not obvious which of the seven factors will be the driving force&#13;
in changing a particular organization at a particular point in&#13;
time.&#13;
2/ This implies a shift from management by control and adherence to&#13;
procedures and processes, to management by intellectual leadership, and&#13;
by orchestration of all the capabilities of an organization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
II. THE EVOLUTION OF PLANNING&#13;
The reasons for the emergence of strategic management and the&#13;
problems of implanting strategic planning processes in organizations can be&#13;
best understood within a historical perspective. This perspective suggests&#13;
that management systems evolved in response to qualitative changes in the&#13;
environment. Each system addressed a particular challenge, and as its&#13;
limitations became clear, other capabilities were added to complement&#13;
earlier systems and/or older systems had to be totally transformed.&#13;
Four major stages are recognized here:&#13;
financial planning (management by budgetary control)&#13;
long range planning (management by extrapolation; improved&#13;
forecasting)&#13;
strategic planning (management by strategic analysis and&#13;
positioning)&#13;
strategic management (management by widespread strategic&#13;
thinking, well defined strategic framework, effectively&#13;
communicated vision and strategy, and strong culture).&#13;
A. Financial Planning&#13;
This stage emphasizes the annual budgeting process and&#13;
operational efficiency issues. This is the dominant activity of top&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
management and was sufficient for the continued growth of organizations&#13;
within stable environments. It still predominates in large bureaucracies&#13;
and heavily regulated institutions. It remains an important building block&#13;
of more advanced planning systems. However, its role, structure and links&#13;
to other management functions have been changed in fundamental ways when&#13;
used in the context of advanced strategic planning systems.&#13;
The traditional budgeting process is based on standards of&#13;
efficiency and performance that are implicit in budgetary projections and&#13;
targets, and are derived from historical experience. This process has been&#13;
subjected to continuous refinement; to increase flexibility and&#13;
transparency; to increase delegation and task control; and to facilitate&#13;
other management functions. A new approach to the use of budgeting for&#13;
setting performance (productivity) targets calls for the use not only of&#13;
historical data, but for the establishment of commitments that emerge from&#13;
a strategic plan, or from negotiations conducted within a management by&#13;
objectives (MBO) framework. Other approaches to link budgets to&#13;
performance improvements and enhance non-incremental resource decisions are&#13;
Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) and Zero-Based Budgeting&#13;
(ZBB). The latter establishes a set of comprehensive rules to force&#13;
managers to justify their budgetary allocations from ground zero. These&#13;
refinements are usually associated with later stages in the evolution of&#13;
planning.&#13;
The complementary process to the budget is financial control.&#13;
Financial control measurements are used to judge the performance of a&#13;
corporation or of well-defined segments within a corporation. Recent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
advances have emphasized the transparency of cost structures as the basis&#13;
for formulating competitive strategies, low cost comparative advantage, and&#13;
competitive marketing and pricing (e.g., the deregulated banking&#13;
services). The notion of the responsibility center has been developed to&#13;
promote the decentralized accountability of profit and cost performance at&#13;
various levels in the organization. Substantial gains in performance&#13;
improvements can still be achieved, particularly among public organizations&#13;
such as the Bank, by rendering the cost structure transparent and by&#13;
subjecting line managers to internal market discipline and incentives that&#13;
serve broad institutional goals.&#13;
Even among profit-oriented organizations, exclusive reliance on&#13;
budgeting and financial controls as a planning mode has proven to have&#13;
major limitations. The main pitfall is excessive myopia and undue concern&#13;
with short-term objectives (profitability or cost effectiveness) at the&#13;
expense of the long-term development of the organization. Moreover,&#13;
budgetary-based resource allocation decisions lack a long run framework for&#13;
strategic commitments. The proper development and communication of the&#13;
business (institutional) strategy and the translation of the resulting&#13;
strategic commitment into resource allocations and meaningful performance&#13;
indicators are essential requirements to prevent the misuse of budgeting&#13;
and financial controls. Targets for a given year can probably be&#13;
achieved. The main question is, at what price?&#13;
B. Long-Range Planning&#13;
Long range (LR) planning was a response adopted by many firms to&#13;
manage the unprecedented growth triggered by the economic boom during the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
post World War II period. To meet the required expansions of capacity and&#13;
to find the corresponding financial resources, it became necessary to&#13;
extend the planning horizon beyond annual budgeting. The starting point&#13;
for LR planning is a multi-year forecast of demand (the firm's sales). All&#13;
other functional plans are based on this forecast, which represent a growth&#13;
commitment of the organization. The final step is the aggregation of these&#13;
functional plans (projections) into a long or medium-term financial plan.&#13;
The forecasting effort relied heavily on historical projections and was&#13;
primarily a bottom-up aggregation of budgets and programs.&#13;
The primary contribution of LR planning and budgeting has been to&#13;
provide a multi-year perspective on resources and thus facilitate the&#13;
development of strategies and policies for their use. It forced managers&#13;
to confront the long term resource implications of their decisions. The&#13;
limitations of this mode of planning became clear with the increasing&#13;
uncertainties of demand and growth prospects and the growing awareness of&#13;
the need to better understand the market/client. With increasing&#13;
competition and growing complexity in the environment, some of the basic&#13;
assumptions underlying forecast-based planning were called into question.&#13;
The growing uncertainties frustrated the forecasters and undermined the&#13;
credibility of "blue print" planning. The typical reaction of&#13;
forecast-based planning has been to add further complexity and data to&#13;
heir large scale forecasting models. Moreover, beginning the process with&#13;
sales (demand) forecasts represents a serious flaw. Instead, the focus&#13;
should be on forecasting total markets (needs) which are linked to sales&#13;
through the market share. The latter is a critically important decision&#13;
variable in the definition of a strategic position. LR planning also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
assumes a static portfolio (mix) of products and a focus on current&#13;
capabilities. This type of planning has often deteriorated into a&#13;
mechanical routine and a mere extrapolation of the past. It has distracted&#13;
managers from understanding client needs and the dynamics of markets. It&#13;
has focussed planners' attention on predicting rather than creating the&#13;
future. It has often made managers fall into the trap of thinking they&#13;
were creating a sustained growth situation when, in fact they were merely&#13;
being driven by highly favorable external forces. Even when conditions&#13;
were not favorable, forecasted trends have often shown a tendency among&#13;
planners that has come to be called the "hockey sticks" phenomenon which&#13;
are plans that project a sudden recovery of demand (sales, lending) and&#13;
performance, even after a sustained decline.&#13;
LR planning does not work under changing external conditions,&#13;
increasing uncertainties, intensive competition, or in situations that call&#13;
for major discontinuities between the past and the future. Likewise, it&#13;
does not work for organizations with diversified products (programs or&#13;
services) or corporations engaged in a variety of businesses. The&#13;
functional orientation of LR planning presupposes a monolithic business&#13;
structure and a homogenous customer (need). When there is a multiplicity&#13;
of businesses (clients, geographic markets), it is essential, first, to&#13;
understand their inherent differences in order to meet their distinctive&#13;
needs. Notwithstanding its shortcomings, LR planning constituted an&#13;
important first step in preparing for the next stage of planning&#13;
evolution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
C. Strategic Planning&#13;
With accelerating structural changes in the national and global&#13;
economies and growing uncertainty, complexity and unpredictability in the&#13;
environment3/, organizations began to lose faith in forecasting and in the&#13;
use of blueprint planning to eliminate uncertainties. Planning had to&#13;
become externally-oriented. Strategic planning has provided some key&#13;
concepts and processes which help to understand the market and the forces&#13;
driving change, a dynamic and creative framework for resource allocation,&#13;
and a process for the generation and evaluation of strategic choices at&#13;
various levels in complex and diversified organizations. The following&#13;
three key concepts that have been used extensively in strategic planning:&#13;
(1) Segmentation and the Strategic Business Unit (SBU), (2) portfolio&#13;
management, and (3) a hierarchy of strategies. In the following&#13;
discussion, each of these concepts is first described and is then employed&#13;
in a prototype strategic planning cycle to illustrate its role and how the&#13;
system operates at prototypical managerial levels and in the strategic&#13;
planning process.&#13;
(a) Segmentation and the Strategic Business Unit (SBU)&#13;
The concept of segmenting a company's activities in the market&#13;
place into strategic business areas arose in response to the increasing&#13;
diversity and complexity of the businesses and environments that&#13;
diversified companies had to manage. With diversification, the first step&#13;

socio-economic environment and their implications for institutions see&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

in strategic analysis became not to define "the business we are in"4/, but&#13;
to identify the multiplicity of the distinctive businesses of the company.&#13;
In order to do this, management had to make a fundamental change in&#13;
outlook. It became necessary to question the historical portfolio of&#13;
businesses and to avoid limiting business prospects to historical product&#13;
lines and established operational units. It became necessary to shift to&#13;
an "outside-in" perspective: to analyze the environment of the firm in&#13;
terms of distinctive areas of demands, trends, threats and opportunities.&#13;
The unit for this analysis is the strategic business area (SBA)&#13;
which is a distinctive segment of the environment in which the firm does&#13;
(or may want to do) business. As the first step in strategy analysis, the&#13;
respective SBA's are identified and analyzed without any references to the&#13;
firm's structure or its current products. In business, the pioneer was GE,&#13;
which developed a complementary concept called the Strategic Business Unit&#13;
(SBU) which is a unit of the firm responsible for developing the firm's&#13;
strategic position in one or more SBA's.&#13;
This environment-centered perspective was pioneered in the U.S.&#13;
Department of Defense by developing the "mission slice" and creating new&#13;
units charged with strategic planning for the respective "mission slices",&#13;
independent of the operating departments of the Defense (Army, Navy, Air,&#13;
Marines). One example of a mission slice was the "Polaris" missile&#13;
development project. In this application, the SBU's had only strategic&#13;
planning responsibility, the departments being responsible for strategy&#13;
implementation.&#13;
4/ The importance of defining or choosing the right business is reflected&#13;
in the criticism leveled against railroads and petroleum companies for&#13;
failing to articulate their business concepts, to be in the&#13;
"transportation business" and in the "energy business" respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
In our survey, we found considerable variations between&#13;
corporations in relating the strategic structure (the hierarchy of SBU's)&#13;
to the operating organization. In the Department of Defense example&#13;
mentioned above, the duality of structure, one for strategy formulation and&#13;
the other for implementation, led to conflicts and problems during&#13;
implementation. To avoid such duality, GE undertook the difficult task of&#13;
matching existing operating units to the SBA's, thus making their SBU's&#13;
responsible not only for strategy planning and implementation, but also for&#13;
subsequent operating performance (profit making or satisfying the&#13;
market)5/. An intermediate step between the above options is to create a&#13;
strategic (SBU) structure that articulates strategy formulation and&#13;
implementation but assigns the strategic roles to the operating managers;&#13;
in this case many managers assume dual roles, strategic and operational.&#13;
Given this, systems and incentives must be developed to balance their&#13;
attention between short- and long-term imperatives6/. In the terminology&#13;
of Texas Instruments, these individuals wear "two hats". Other&#13;
organizations have used the SBU structure for new business development&#13;
5/ But GE found there are limitations to reorganizing the firm to provide&#13;
one-to-one correspondence of SBA's and SBU's because a reorganization&#13;
based on the SBA, which maximizes the effectiveness of strategy&#13;
formulation and implementation, may compromise the firm's operating&#13;
performance or may be infeasible in light of commbrn resources and&#13;
production linkages.&#13;
6/ At Texas Instruments, a planning organization was adopted which&#13;
differed from the organization for operating day-to-day business.&#13;
Short-run operations are decentralized to product/customer centers&#13;
(PCCs), which were keyed to existing capabilities, serving existing&#13;
markets and incremental expansions. A new structure, called&#13;
Objectives/Strategies/Tactics (OST) has been created to supplement the&#13;
PCC structure. At the top of the OST structure are the objective&#13;
managers, and each objective is served by several strategy managers.&#13;
In turn, each strategy is served by several tactics managers. These&#13;
managers are selected among the senior and line managers and are&#13;
expected to handle both their short-run operating responsibility and&#13;
the assigned long-run strategic responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
while maintaining the formal organizational structure for on-going&#13;
businesses7/. The most extreme case that can be adopted in seeking&#13;
integration between operational and strategic responsibilities, when these&#13;
responsibilities cannot be squarely assigned to a single individual&#13;
(wearing "two hats"), is the matrix structure8/.&#13;
Many organizations have used the SBA/SBU concept as the basis for&#13;
periodically realigning the operating structure with the strategic focus of&#13;
their businesses/markets. Others have adopted a dual structure, reflecting&#13;
the difficulty of changing the operating structure too frequently and the&#13;
flexibility that the SBU structure can provide by changing the strategic&#13;
aspects of management processes to respond to accelerated changes in the&#13;
environment without full reorganization of operations.&#13;
The segmentation process may be guided by various dimensions,&#13;
depending on the driving forces of the market and the organization. The&#13;
common dimensions used to determine SBA's/SBU's are: demand (growth&#13;
prospects), customer type, geography and technology. The segmentation&#13;
process must identify a large number of significantly different&#13;
combinations of SBA's/SBU's so that each SBA/SBU should include as few&#13;
product/market segments as possible to allow for the development of&#13;
7/  At Elkem (Norway), both an SBU organization and a formal organization&#13;
were initially developed; the SBU organization was actively used to&#13;
introduce new products or ideas. After a while, however, the SBU&#13;
organization tended to be formalized into a structure conforming with&#13;
the rest of the company.   IBM's Personal Computer Project and GM's&#13;
"Saturn Project" are variations on this approach to the use of SBU's.&#13;
8/ A true matrix organization however is more than an organizational&#13;
structure; it has overwhelming cultural, behavioral, planning and&#13;
systems implications, all of which should be congruent and properly&#13;
balanced for the matrix to be viable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
coherent SBU strategies and meaningful decisions on the strategic&#13;
allocation of resources. On the other hand, the number of SBA's/SBU's must&#13;
be small enough to ensure a manageable span of control for the top&#13;
management and corporate planners and hence to keep strategic decisions&#13;
manageable and the strategy of the overall organization coherent.&#13;
Regardless of the limitations and the difficulties in segmenting&#13;
a firm's environment into SBA's and reorienting its own internal structure&#13;
in terms of SBU's, the SBU concept has become a common tool for giving a&#13;
clearly organized view of its future environment and of differentiating its&#13;
strategies to meet the increasing diversity of the businesses (roles) it is&#13;
in. The SBU has become to strategic planning what a profit (cost) center&#13;
is to financial planning. During our survey we noted that the leading&#13;
organizations have further enriched this concept to enhance the&#13;
decentralization of strategy formulation, to improve the focus of dialogue&#13;
among levels of management on strategic issues, and to ensure&#13;
accountability for strategy implementation.&#13;
(b) Portfolio Analysis/Competitive Positioning&#13;
Although the concept of portfolio management and the analytical&#13;
tools used for its implementation have been limited to private diversified&#13;
corporations, it is important for its impact on strategic thinking and the&#13;
possible development of parallel methodologies in other organizations that&#13;
might enhance thinking about and the communication of distinct strategies.&#13;
The essence of portfolio methods is to position each business&#13;
(domain) within a matrix in accordance with: (1) the attractiveness of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
industry (market growth, economic factors, etc.) and (2) the competitive&#13;
strength (market share, comparative advantage, etc.) of the firm. This&#13;
corresponds to viewing a business strategy as a response to two dimensions:&#13;
(1) in facing the external environment, to try to take advantage of market&#13;
opportunities and neutralize adverse environmental impact; and (2) in&#13;
facing the internal environment, to reinforce internal strengths and&#13;
improve upon perceived weaknesses. Put differently, the portfolio matrix&#13;
views strategy as a plan of action for maximizing or realigning one's&#13;
strength (comparative advantage) against the forces at work in the&#13;
environment (demands and opportunities). The results of this analysis,&#13;
presented in a simple graphical display, allow managers to visualize the&#13;
contribution of each business to the corporate portfolio. At the corporate&#13;
level, portfolio analysis provides a tool to set up criteria for resource&#13;
allocation among various SBU's, to identify the major strategic issues and&#13;
performance gaps facing various SBU's, and to balance the risks and&#13;
potentials, developmental (investment) needs, and cash flows among various&#13;
SBU's. At the business/SBU levels, the focus of attention changes to&#13;
specific product/market segments.&#13;
Among the most popular portfolio matrices is the "Attractiveness-&#13;
Strength Matrix", developed by General Electric and McKinsey &amp; Co. The&#13;
process begins with the identification of critical external factors which&#13;
are noncontrollable by the firm. This leads to the determination of the&#13;
overall attractiveness of the industry to which the business belongs (e.g.&#13;
market size, market growth rate, competitive structure, industry&#13;
profitability, political concerns, technological factors, ...) and&#13;
similarly to identify the critical internal (success) factors, which are&#13;
largely controllable by the firm. These factors are weighed and use to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
identify the current position of the business in the "Attractive Strength&#13;
Matrix". The process of generating and probing these factors is&#13;
fundamental to a deeper understanding of the business the firm is in and&#13;
the firm's own strengths and weaknesses. This process is repeated by&#13;
identifying the trends of each external factor to gain an understanding of&#13;
the most likely environment the firm will be facing and to anticipate&#13;
explicitly what are the competitive, economic, financial, socio-political&#13;
and technological assumptions on which its proposed strategic actions will&#13;
be based, (often, this step does not lead to a single projection, but to&#13;
several scenarios). Having determined the future trends of industry&#13;
attractiveness, a strategic position is selected for the future development&#13;
of that business (SBA/SBU), and the global competitive strategy (desired&#13;
business strength) is decided. Subsequently, the new positioning of each&#13;
of the controllable success factors is selected to achieve that overall&#13;
business strength; this step provides the basis for identifying the&#13;
multi-functional action programs necessary to secure a long-term&#13;
sustainable competitive advantage. The strategies formulated for each&#13;
business thus have two components: (i) broad action programs based on the&#13;
controllable success factors (neutralize internal weaknesses, build on&#13;
positions of strength); and (ii) broad action programs based on the&#13;
external factors (prevent negative consequences of adverse trends, take&#13;
advantages of potential opportunities).&#13;
Portfolio approaches have made important contributions to the&#13;
improvement of strategic planning thinking. They represent simple and&#13;
effective ways of decomposing the firm's activities into a set of&#13;
well-defined businesses. By permitting the clear differentiation of the&#13;
nature of each business in terms of industry attractiveness and competitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
position, portfolio approaches allow top managers to set distinct&#13;
strategies for each business in accordance with its inherent potential and&#13;
developmental needs. They also represent a way of communication that&#13;
captures the essence of strategic options confronting a diversified firm.&#13;
They were judged as most significant in raising the strategic alertness&#13;
(external orientation) of many managers we met since their implementation&#13;
has required a minimum level of quantitative information regarding market&#13;
potential and competitors performance. They have provided a disciplined&#13;
process for seeking opportunities for growth, and a necessary step for&#13;
improving environmental intelligence. Finally, portfolio management raises&#13;
awareness and provides a common framework for examining the corporation's&#13;
comparative advantage in each business and for making difficult choices to&#13;
ensure selectivity in each segment or role.&#13;
(c) Hierarchies of Strategies&#13;
Within large organizations, strategy formulation processes were&#13;
progressively differentiated to match key levels of executive and operating&#13;
management. This need for multi-level planning and strategy formulation&#13;
parallels the need for a hierarchy of objectives in large organizations.&#13;
This differentiation was also a response to the need to deepen strategic&#13;
thinking and action throughout the organization, involve lower levels of&#13;
the managerial hierarchy, and promote decentralization and responsiveness.&#13;
The common hierarchy of strategies (planning levels) involves the following&#13;
three major levels: (a) Corporate Strategy; (b) business (SBU) strategies;&#13;
and (c) functional strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
The emphasis of corporate-level planning is on establishing the&#13;
mission of the firm, stating corporate objectives and strategic thrusts,&#13;
defining a corporate philosophy and values, identifying the domains in&#13;
which the firm will operate, and on the broad allocation of resources&#13;
consistent with corporate priorities. The corporate level strategy is&#13;
concerned primarily with answering the question: what set of businesses&#13;
(roles) should we be in? Consequently, scope (product/market segments) and&#13;
resource deployment among the SBU's are the primary focus of corporate&#13;
strategy.&#13;
At the business level, strategy focuses on how to operate or&#13;
compete in a particular business or product/market (service/client)&#13;
segment. The most important components of business strategy are&#13;
determining present resource and skill deployment (distinctive competence)&#13;
and creating competitive advantages by repositioning resources vis-a-vis&#13;
competitors (other actors).&#13;
At the functional level, the focus of strategy is on maximizing&#13;
resource productivity, integrating activities to support corporate and SBU&#13;
strategies, and the further development of distinctive competences of the&#13;
overall organization, (e.g. R&amp;D).&#13;
In our survey we found many variations regarding the degree of&#13;
emphasis on one of these levels of planning. For conglomerates, holding&#13;
companies and where extensive decentralization of planning has been&#13;
achieved (such as CitiCorp.), most strategic planning activities are&#13;
carried out at the SBU level. In other complex conglomerates, where groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
of SBU's share significant resources and concerns among themselves (HP,&#13;
GE), a new hierarchical level called group or sector management has been&#13;
introduced to promote synergy among SBU's. Yet in other organizations&#13;
where strategic planning is relatively recent and planning skills and&#13;
culture are not commonly shared, corporate-level planning is the focus and&#13;
is oriented towards controlling and evaluating strategic planning at the&#13;
SBU level or major participation in SBU planning activities. At&#13;
functionally-organized firms, corporate planning is relatively centralized&#13;
and often combined with planning for key functional areas (at Kodak,&#13;
technology planning is the responsibility of corporate planners). In sum,&#13;
the scope of planning at various levels varies between organizations&#13;
because, among other reasons, of variations in management style, the degree&#13;
of diversity among businesses and markets, the degree of common sharing in&#13;
strategic resources, and the availability of planning skills at lower&#13;
levels.&#13;
(d) The Strategic Planning Process&#13;
The above discussion of the key concepts of strategic planning&#13;
can now be used to describe the process of strategic planning in a&#13;
prototypical fashion. At the risk of being overly simplistic, the&#13;
following diagrams provide a brief description of a typical strategic&#13;
planning process, involving corporate, business and functional levels (see&#13;
Figures 1 and 2). It should be emphasized that the survey indicates that&#13;
there are many variations to this process, depending on the clharacteristics&#13;
of the firm (its structure) and its businesses and environment (see Annex&#13;
1). The following describes some common properties among these variations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
The strategic planning process depicted in the diagrams provides&#13;
a disciplined and well-defined organizational effort to specify and&#13;
evaluate strategies at the business and functional levels within the&#13;
framework of overall corporate mission, objectives, and priorities. The&#13;
following is a brief account of the objectives of each step in the cycle:&#13;
Step (1) and (3) The Corporate and Business Missions&#13;
(See Figure 1)&#13;
The corporate mission is a relatively permanent statement that&#13;
communicates institutional purpose and business scope, provides a&#13;
framework to relate the institution to its primary stakeholders, and&#13;
states the broad objectives of the organization's performance. This&#13;
statement often includes an expression of the mission of the&#13;
organization in terms of its product and market (service and client),&#13;
and of the way to achieve its competitive advantage (leadership)9/.&#13;
It often identifies the SBUs and their interactions in terms of shared&#13;
resources and concerns. Finally, it articulates the corporate&#13;
philosophy in terms of corporate policies (e.g., relationship to&#13;
clients) and cultural values (e.g., commitment to excellence,&#13;
entrepreneurship). The mission at the SBU level is sharper and more&#13;
detailed.&#13;
9/ One useful tool used to reflect upon changes in the mission of a firm&#13;
is the concept of the driving force (NCR, Tregoe). The following&#13;
strategic areas have been suggested as forces that decisively influence&#13;
the nature and direction of any organization: markets/ products&#13;
(market needs, products offered), capabilities (technology, production&#13;
capabilities,.method of sale, distribution, natural resources), and&#13;
results (growth, return-profits). For example, the market-needs driven&#13;
organization will be constantly looking for alternative ways to fill&#13;
the needs it is currently filling; and searching for new or emerging&#13;
needs in the market-segment it serves.&#13;

Step 2: Formulating Strategic Posture&#13;
(See Figures 1 and 2)&#13;
The corporate mission has to be translated into more concrete&#13;
guidelines which serve as immediate challenges for the development of&#13;
strategic proposals at the business level (SBUs) and in the major&#13;
functions of the firm. This is expressed as a strategic posture which&#13;
has to be distilled from the mission and the situational analysis of&#13;
the external and internal environments. As indicated in Figure 3,&#13;
situational analysis encompases both environmental scanning (including&#13;
forecasting and scenario development) to identify external threats and&#13;
opportunities, and internal scrutiny to identify the strengths and&#13;
weaknesses of the corporation. The resulting outputs are: corporate&#13;
strategic thrusts (the primary issues the organization must address in&#13;
the next 3-5 years to play its roles, the identification of specific&#13;
planning challenges for the corporation, businesses (SBUs) and&#13;
functional areas, and the statement of corporate performance&#13;
objectives (quantitative indicators). This step provides the&#13;
framework for formulating strategies and action plans at all levels of&#13;
the firm.&#13;
Step 4: Formulation of Business Strategy&#13;
(See Figures 1 and 2)&#13;
This step requires a thorough analysis of the current and future&#13;
business position in terms of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
(a) the non-controllable forces of the external environment which&#13;
determine the industry trends and market opportunities; and&#13;
(b) the internal competencies of the firm which will determine its&#13;
unique competitive leadership. Strategy formulation at this&#13;
level is also guided by the strategic thrusts provided at the&#13;
corporate level. The result of this step is a broad outline of&#13;
multi-year action programs.&#13;
Step 5: Formulation of Functional Strategy&#13;
In highly decentralized corporations, functional managers are directly&#13;
involved in the development of their corresponding functional&#13;
strategies to support each business unit (SBU) in the planning process&#13;
(Step 4). Functional strategies are also formulated in response to&#13;
relevant corporate thrusts. In corporations with businesses that&#13;
share centralized support functions, the functional managers might be&#13;
in a position to analyze the business strategies and broad action&#13;
programs proposed by business managers and indicate their concurrent&#13;
or non-concurrence with them. When a functional area (resource) is&#13;
critical to the overall organization, the formulation of its strategy&#13;
becomes closely linked to the corporate strategy (e.g., technology&#13;
planning in high-tech organizations; professional resources planning&#13;
in Price Waterhouse).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Step 6: Consolidation of Business and Functional Strategies&#13;
(See Figure 1)&#13;
This step is crucial and usually involves the critical review and&#13;
approval at the corporate level of the set of broad action programs&#13;
proposed by business (SBU) and functional managers. It requires the&#13;
involvement of all key executives who share the responsibility for&#13;
shaping the strategic direction of the firm. It addresses the&#13;
following issues: resolution of conflicts between managers of&#13;
businesses and functional areas; balancing the business portfolio of&#13;
the firm (priorities among businesses); defining the availability of&#13;
strategic funds; and preliminary evaluation of proposed action&#13;
programs and their priorities for resource allocation.&#13;
Steps 7 &amp; 8: Definition and Evaluation of Specific Action Programs&#13;
(See Figure 1)&#13;
Once strategies are defined and approved, this step specifies the&#13;
instruments for deploying the strategic funds in terms of structured,&#13;
coherent and timed actions. In most corporations, these actions&#13;
involve capital investments and developmental expenses.&#13;
Step 9: Resource Allocation and Performance Measures&#13;
(See Figure 1)&#13;
At this step, top managers are confronted with the task of making a&#13;
final evaluation of the proposals originated at the business and&#13;
functional levels. In addition, performance measurements are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
developed to facilitate control and monitoring of the action programs&#13;
supporting business and functional strategies.&#13;
Steps 10, 11 &amp; 12: Strategic and Operational Budgeting&#13;
(See Figure 1)&#13;
Once all strategic programs have been approved and resources allocated&#13;
accordingly, business and functional managers are left with the task&#13;
of translating those commitments into detailed operating budgets and&#13;
precise estimates of the strategic funds neededlO/. The new concept&#13;
that has emerged in recent years among leading organizations has been&#13;
the separation of strategic from operational budgets in order to&#13;
sharpen and make more accountable the strategic commitments of the&#13;
organization.&#13;
(e) The Use of Scenarios in Strategic Planning&#13;
There are three essential ingredients in the formulation of&#13;
corporate strategic thrusts: the corporate mission, an assessment of&#13;
corporate strengths and weaknesses (internal scrutiny) and an environmental&#13;
assessment (Figure 2). Scenarios are now developed at a growing number of&#13;
companies (such as Shell, Amoco, NCR) as a critical input into&#13;
environmental assessment. In particular, it is used to specify the&#13;
10/ "Strategic funds" for an organization is the equivalent to a&#13;
"development budget" for a government; they are expense items required&#13;
for the implementation of strategic action programs whose benefits are&#13;
expected to be accrued in the long-term, beyond the current budget&#13;
period. This definition goes beyond the traditional "capital budget"&#13;
and includes areas such as research and development, strategic items&#13;
to open new markets and develop new businesses, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
planning focus, the basic environmental assumptions for planning, and the&#13;
contingency conditions, and to identify key threats and opportunities that&#13;
may be confronted or exploited. The growing use of scenarios is mainly the&#13;
result of increased awareness that institutions have to plan and adapt to&#13;
environments with major uncertainties and discontinuities. Forecasting&#13;
models have not provided for the timely introduction of new factors or&#13;
parameters that result from discontinuities; quantitative techniques have&#13;
only addressed quantifiable phenomena and have inevitably extrapolated the&#13;
future from the past. In contrast, scenario development stimulates&#13;
thinking about different logics of change in the macro environment,&#13;
accommodates structural and qualitative changes, and takes account of&#13;
political, social and technological forces in addition to the economic&#13;
ones.&#13;
Scenarios are not predictions; rather, they are coherent&#13;
descriptions of plausible futures. Scenarios do not reduce uncertainty;&#13;
they clarify it. They complement traditional approaches to forecasting by&#13;
focusing planners' and decisions makers' attention on the critical&#13;
assumptions that underlie corporate strategies and strategic decisions, on&#13;
the different plausible logics of change and early signs for their&#13;
unfolding, and on the opportunities and threats present in these distinct&#13;
change logics.&#13;
The use of scenarios in strategic planning are varied. In some&#13;
diversified chemical companies, they are used to provide a common framework&#13;
for SBU strategy development, for corporate assessment of SBU strategies&#13;
and/or corporate allocation of resources among SBUs. For several&#13;
integrated oil companies, scenarios are used to convey planning premises at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
corporate and businesses levels for plan formulation at various levels of&#13;
the organization (Shell). At some high-tech companies (NCR), scenarios are&#13;
used to provide forward looking and holistic views of the word which could&#13;
provide the basis for formulating their basic thrusts in R&amp;D, product&#13;
development and markets. At others, scenarios are used as a top management&#13;
stimulus for thinking about crucial and difficult-to-define environments.&#13;
Some companies have experimented with various types and uses of&#13;
scenarios. The Royal Dutch Shell group was one of the first companies to&#13;
use scenarios in planning. Experimentation with scenarios started at Shell&#13;
in 1971, mainly due to dissatisfaction with other forecasting approaches.&#13;
The company now uses three kinds of scenarios - long-range, medium-term,&#13;
and operating company - to serve different roles in planning and to address&#13;
different sorts of concerns and time horizons. Long range global scenarios&#13;
cover the world and go forward about 20 years; medium-term scenarios cover&#13;
5-years and serve as a backdrop for nearer-term, more cyclical planning&#13;
issues. Another tier of scenarios is developed by specific planning&#13;
departments and operating companies to focus on the concerns most relevant&#13;
to Shell's operating companies and particular major investments. The&#13;
20-year scenarios primarily serve Shell's committee of managing directors;&#13;
the planning group that prepares and revises these scenarios is&#13;
organizationally close to that committee. Shell revises its long term&#13;
scenarios every 4 to 5 years, and its mediumrterm scenarios every year.&#13;
Shell planners underscore the value of the global scenarios in providing a&#13;
"common language" for Shell's operating companies for use in their specific&#13;
and more tailored scenarios. Reflecting its culture, the company strongly&#13;
encourages interaction among diverse parts of its organization in creating,&#13;
critiquing, and using scenarios. It also pays special attention to how it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
presents scenarios and related information to users. Working with such an&#13;
elaborate scenario development system is not without problems, but the&#13;
company's scenario approach has been highly successful in raising the&#13;
quality of information and debate about its future and its future business&#13;
environment, both critical to good strategic thinking.&#13;
(f) Contingency Planning&#13;
In turbulent environments, contingency planning and alternative&#13;
futures explorations become a necessity. The strategic planning process is&#13;
based on the most likely future forecast or scenario. However, there are&#13;
less likely conditions that would create serious difficulties for a firm if&#13;
they actually occurred; these are the subject matter of contingency plans.&#13;
The fundamental purpose of contingency planning is to place managers in a&#13;
position to deal more effectively with unexpected developments than if they&#13;
had not made such preparations. An additional advantage cited for&#13;
contingency planning is that it forces managers to look at dimensions of&#13;
the environment other than probable events.&#13;
Since there are many events which might cause serious damage to&#13;
most organizations, a few of these contingencies must be identified and&#13;
selected for planning, such as deviations from expected demand (sales) or&#13;
profits, political threats, or the loss of a major customer. These events&#13;
are screened for their criticality (impact) and probability. Answering the&#13;
"what if" question might then entail the formulation of strategies for&#13;
advance actions to avert the possible event, of strategies to respond to it&#13;
if it actually occurs and of tactical plans to implement the strategies.&#13;
Contingency plans may also specify trigger points or warning signals of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
imminence of the event for which the plan is developed. For reasons of&#13;
economy and practicality contingency plans are usually few and should be&#13;
made for really critical events, not merely troublesome ones.&#13;
Alternative scenarios and means of futures explorations can serve&#13;
to identify events that might become the subject of a contingency plan.&#13;
They can also serve to stretch the imagination of managers and staff; they&#13;
force managers to deal with interactions of forces that might be missed in&#13;
single case projections or in a base scenario. Hence, as with strategic&#13;
planning in general, contingency planning is likely to assist managers in&#13;
dealing with crises for which no contingency plans have been prepared.&#13;
Scenarios can also serve in developing contingency planning&#13;
capability by enhancing environmental scanning and improving the robustness&#13;
of the selected strategy. When using scenarios, the best strategy would be&#13;
one that will work well within the envelope of trends and uncertainties&#13;
that all the plausible scenarios encompass. Most companies cannot meet&#13;
this goal in practice and rather choose as a "planning focus" one or two&#13;
scenarios that reflect the decision makers' view of what is currently most&#13;
likely; they then design strategies to fit the "planning focus" best. Some&#13;
companies however use the other plausible scenarios as background for&#13;
building flexibility into strategies made in the context of a "planning&#13;
focus" scenario. Finally, by identifying critical uncertainties, scenarios&#13;
provide a framework for the strategic monitoring of the environment and&#13;
provide a selective framework for the early detection of changes and for&#13;
switching to other scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
(g) Value Added by Strategic Planning&#13;
Formal strategic planning constitutes a powerful tool to enhance&#13;
managerial understanding and to guide strategic resource allocation&#13;
(including redeployment and reorganization). Among the most important&#13;
contributions of the above concepts and processes are:&#13;
(i) Providing direction, coherence and unity to organizational&#13;
efforts: By starting the process with a clear articulation&#13;
of the mission of the organization, and subsequently by the&#13;
mission (role) of each SBU, and the recognition of its&#13;
distinctive competencies, the planning process formulates&#13;
unifying thrusts and mobilizes the key managers in the&#13;
pursuit of agreed upon objectives. Strategic planning&#13;
provides a strategic framework to guide resource&#13;
allocation, new business initiatives, the innovation and&#13;
development of new products and markets and many of the&#13;
daily decisions of managers at all levels of the&#13;
organization.&#13;
(ii) Introducing a discipline for long-term thinking: The formal&#13;
planning process enforces a logical process and a calendar&#13;
for thinking about strategic options and tasks and thus&#13;
ensures that managerial time, especially of top management,&#13;
is not preempted entirely by short-term operational issues.&#13;
It encourages managers to reflect upon the strategic&#13;
direction of the business.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
(iii) Raising awareness about the environment: By analyzing&#13;
competitive advantage and the position of businesses&#13;
vis-a-vis competitors and market prospects, the process has&#13;
induced managers to be more externally focussed. An&#13;
extensive amount of information is collected on the overall&#13;
structure of the industry (business) and its trends, on the&#13;
strength and possible strategic moves of competitors, on the&#13;
comparative advantage of potential complementary actors (for&#13;
joint ventures), and of customer needs, perceptions (image)&#13;
of the product, and the degree of satisfaction with it.&#13;
(iv)  Enhancing the dialogue among managers on strategy:  The&#13;
process has been used, in varying degrees, to focus senior&#13;
management attention on shaping and evaluating the&#13;
strategies of line management at all levels of the&#13;
organization. It has also enhanced the comunication of&#13;
strategic options and issues at corporate and business&#13;
levels.&#13;
(v)  Improving the organization of the firm:  Segmentation and&#13;
portfolio analysis have often forced a continued examination&#13;
of the organizational structure, both to enhance business&#13;
autonomy oriented towards serving evolving but distinct&#13;
markets and to exploit potential synergies.&#13;
(vi) Educating managers in strategic thinking: Perhaps this&#13;
is the most important contribution. Engaging in&#13;
communication, generating multiple negotiations, creating a,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
need to understand the primary factors affecting the&#13;
business, the common understanding of corporate objectives,&#13;
and the personal involvement in answering the strategic&#13;
issues that arise during strategy formulation, is what makes&#13;
the planning process worthwhile.&#13;
(h) The Limitations of Strategic Planning&#13;
Like earlier forms of planning, strategic planning failed to meet&#13;
all the expectations and demands for strategic behavior by organizations in&#13;
turbulent environments. The following are some of the limitations of&#13;
strategic planning which, if not properly recognized, can destroy its&#13;
effectiveness:&#13;
Tendency towards excessive formalization, bureaucratization and&#13;
ritualization: One of the inherent risks in formalizing any&#13;
process, particularly a creative one, is to create conditions&#13;
that impose an increasing burden and rigidity over time which&#13;
ultimately stifle creativity and result in losing the sense of&#13;
shared objectives the process is intended to support. Planning&#13;
can become an end in itself, and degenerate into a staff&#13;
dominated, paper based, number intensive and control oriented&#13;
activity. This risk is very real and some of the companies we&#13;
visited have fallen in this trap; others have tried various&#13;
innovations to maintain strong vitality and interest in a process&#13;
which can otherwise become time-consuming and repetitive. GE&#13;
experience highlights these risks and the company's efforts to&#13;
de-bureaucratize the process. An approach used by some companies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
(e.g., American Express, Merrill Lynch) is to conduct a&#13;
comprehensive and strategic audit once every several (say five)&#13;
years, and in the interim to deal with selective upgrading and&#13;
marginal adjustments of strategies and programs. Another is to&#13;
selectively identify each year those businesses that deserve more&#13;
careful attention, either because of environmental changes,&#13;
the dynamic nature of their business, or their performance&#13;
problems and risks. Many of the advanced multinationals have&#13;
adopted this approach to ensure timely in-depth review and&#13;
continuous dialogue with selected businesses. A third approach&#13;
is to select each year a planning theme which will require the&#13;
attention of all key managers in their annual planning efforts.&#13;
A fourth is to engage managers in various interactive processes&#13;
to structure their thinking and stimulate their creativity, e.g.,&#13;
the use of scenarios rather than model-based forecasting.&#13;
Institutionalization of the planning process, like many earlier&#13;
management functions, is a necessity. In the case of Texas&#13;
Instruments (TI), the late President and founder of TI argued&#13;
that institutionalization was the cost they had to pay for&#13;
cumulative institutional learning. The challenge, however, is&#13;
not only to prevent the strategic planning process from&#13;
ossification but also to use it as a means to transform other&#13;
institutional capabilities to more entrepreneurial and flexible&#13;
modes.&#13;
Grand design vs. incrementalism and experimelftation: Some&#13;
questions have been raised regarding whether creative thinking&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
can ever emerge from a formal analytical process. The authors of&#13;
the book In Search Of Excellence highlight the need for action-&#13;
orientation, experimentation, "chunking", and risk taking and&#13;
argue that over-reliance on analysis and numbers often leads to a&#13;
built-in conservative bias, a narrow form of rationality, and&#13;
inflexibility.&#13;
The process of logical incrementalism, however, does not have to&#13;
contradict a well-conceived strategic planning process. A&#13;
participatory planning process, which provides a sense of vision&#13;
from the top, but is shared by all key managers, does not blindly&#13;
set a grand design, but rather generates a sense of long term&#13;
direction and continuously adjusts its course of action with a&#13;
strategic posture in mind. Many of the companies we visited&#13;
(e.g. 3M, IBM, HP) have complemented the formal process by&#13;
action-oriented task forces, sponsoring the champions of new&#13;
products/businesses, pilot projects and other approaches for&#13;
learning by doing. Hence, managers proactively guide streams of&#13;
actions, innovations, and events and incrementally buil,d&#13;
strategies at more disaggregate levels and then to integrate and&#13;
institutionalize them.&#13;
Formal vs. entrepreneurial (opportunistic) planning: There is&#13;
also a need to respond to unforseen opportunities and threats&#13;
that arise outside the formal planning cycle. Organizations that&#13;
rely exclusively on formal planning can trap themselves into&#13;
inflexibility and rigidity. On the other hand, an organization&#13;
whose decision making capability rests entirely on ad-hoc&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
opportunistic responses will be constantly reacting to external&#13;
forces, without having a clear sense of direction. Formal&#13;
strategic planning, however, can complement opportunistic&#13;
planning, and if appropriately developed, can train managers in&#13;
strategic thinking and reinforce other efforts to nurture and&#13;
guide an entrepreneurial culture.&#13;
A Calendar-driven vs. continuous planning and real-time response:&#13;
The increasing turbulence of the environment and the need to make&#13;
planning an on-going concern have also called for processes to&#13;
complement the calendar-driven planning process. IBM and TI have&#13;
instituted an alternative system which allows for program&#13;
initiatives (e.g., product development) to be generated at any&#13;
time during the year, as opposed to waiting for the prescribed&#13;
time in which action programs are supposed to be formulated. But&#13;
even under this system, there is a given point in time, called&#13;
period planning when all the program proposals are consolidated&#13;
to be sure they form a consistent strategy. Other firms, such as&#13;
GE, have developed a rolling agenda for the selective review of&#13;
strategic issues and the strategies of their businesses (SBU's)&#13;
to make strategic planning an ongoing process. Volvo views&#13;
strategic plans as continuous guiding frameworks for an ongoing&#13;
decision making process (see Annex 3).&#13;
Isolation of planning from other management functions: This is&#13;
perhaps the most fundamental limitation to the common application&#13;
of strategic planning. The establishment of large centralized&#13;
planning departments has often resulted in isolating the planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
process from the mainstream of managerial decisions. Moreover,&#13;
since its introduction, particularly in the USA, strategic&#13;
planning has been viewed primarily as a rational analytical&#13;
process; implementation was taken for granted. It is assumed&#13;
that, given the new selected strategic posture, the institution&#13;
will muster and allocate its energy to effecting its realignment&#13;
vis-a-vis the environment. The common result was failure in&#13;
implementation. Moreover, following the original approach to&#13;
strategic planning, a new strategy was chosen to match the&#13;
historical strengths of the firm.  In a discontinuous&#13;
environment, however, historical strengths may become irrelevant,&#13;
if not future weaknessesll/. These limitations suggest the need&#13;
to add "capability transformation" planning to strategy&#13;
planning. In particular, there is a need to replace the&#13;
historical strength/weakness concept with a broader concept of&#13;
organizational capability which involves, among others, managers'&#13;
attitudes, capacity for change, structural rigidities and&#13;
culture. Ultimately, planning must become a "way of life" for&#13;
management.&#13;
11/ Henry Ford was so trapped by his historical success in mass production&#13;
that he failed to adjust to market-based competition; his famous&#13;
statement "give it to tj)em-in any color so long as it is black"&#13;
suggests the consequences of taking the client for granted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. THE STATE OF THE ART: STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT&#13;
Strategic management attempts to resolve the above limitations to&#13;
the strategic planning process and to build on the potential contributions&#13;
of strategic planning concepts. It develops the "enabling conditions" for&#13;
carrying out effective strategic planning and implementation. It&#13;
represents a natural evolution in planning practices. It offers a way of&#13;
integrating all organizational capabilities to ensure effective strategic:&#13;
thinking and behavior at all levels in the organization.&#13;
This section discusses some of the fundamental concepts of&#13;
strategic management, concentrating on those aspects that transform or&#13;
complement the strategic planning process. These aspects are organized&#13;
around:&#13;
the need to change the structure and modality of the strategic&#13;
planning process and the role of institutional (corporate)&#13;
planners to ensure that the process is led by the executive and&#13;
line managements and that it remains a creative learning process;&#13;
the need to integrate the multi-level planning processes with the&#13;
other managerial systems and processes at the corresponding&#13;
levels of management; in particular, the need to integrate all&#13;
management systems in the strategic mode;&#13;
the need for additional flexibility to be built into the new&#13;
capability to provide effective and timely responses to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
continuous and unanticipated change and to facilitate the&#13;
management of strategic issues.&#13;
the need to seek congruency between managerial infrastructure&#13;
(formal systems and processes, including planning) and the&#13;
culture; the need to create an entrepreneurial climate that&#13;
supports strategic behavior; strategic management is basically a&#13;
a way of life;&#13;
the need to plan capability transformation to create the new&#13;
capabilities (strengths) necessary for strategy implementation;&#13;
strategic posture management concerns itself simultaneously with&#13;
the strategy and the capability needs of the institution.&#13;
A. Changing and Integrating Strategic Planning and Management Systems&#13;
(a) Changing the Strategic Planning Process&#13;
The major challenge, illustrated by the case study of GE, is to&#13;
use the strategic planning process as a powerful means to institutionalize&#13;
strategic thinking and behavior into the executive management function.&#13;
This should be accomplished in such a way that it integrates the entire&#13;
organization into a coherent whole, yet remains responsive and agile to&#13;
avoid bureaucratization of an otherwise creative mode of decision making.&#13;
This requires a fundamental understanding of the organic nature of&#13;
strategic decision making and the role of planners in facilitating this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
creative process by providing tools, information and orderly social&#13;
interactions to foster superior executive decisions.&#13;
The following illustrates some of the specific changes in the&#13;
structure and modalities of strategic planning at leading corporations.&#13;
(i) Changes in the structure&#13;
The main directions of change in the structure of the&#13;
planning process are intended to:&#13;
*   Focus the process on addressing the real gut issues and&#13;
make it more selective, opportunity seeking and agile (GE,&#13;
Abbott Labs, Salomon). Strategy reviews have well defined&#13;
purposes and no rigid formats.&#13;
*   Enhance the quality of discussions on strategy at the top&#13;
management level and between levels of management, making&#13;
the process more interactive and thought provoking, and&#13;
using it to enhance understanding, consensus, and commit-&#13;
ment. (Abbott Labs, GE, HP, IBM). Some SBU strategies are&#13;
discussed more frequently and in greater depth than others.&#13;
The emphasis is on visualizing and communicating the&#13;
strategy and subjecting its fundamental assumptions to the&#13;
scrutinity and collective judgement of the top management.&#13;
The CEO would not "let his managers get away with no&#13;
strategy or accountability for their business".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
'-44-&#13;
Make strategy formulation and adaptation an ongoing rather&#13;
than calendar-driven process, and thus responsive to&#13;
real-time needs, and closely related to continuous&#13;
monitoring, evaluation, experimentation, and learning. (GE,&#13;
Marriott, Wang). A rolling agenda of issues and business&#13;
strategies are discussed by top management; in managing this&#13;
process, top management is-highly involved, interactive, and&#13;
action oriented.&#13;
Emphasize the use of institutional strategy as a framework&#13;
for guiding all choices, rather than as a "blueprint" plan&#13;
for detailed control and mechanical implementation. The&#13;
heart of the planning process is to deepen the understanding&#13;
of the environment, to clarify purposes and priorities and&#13;
to provide effective means and forums to share these&#13;
understandings and purposes as a guide for daily decision&#13;
making. Strategies are kept in broad, qualitative, and&#13;
easily understood terms. Strategies must provide a firm&#13;
direction to meet clear objectives but allow for maximum&#13;
possible autonomy in meeting them; they should provide&#13;
stable expectations about "what really counts".&#13;
Use task forces and other ad-hoc and flexible means of&#13;
organizing senior management and staff and empower these&#13;
task forces with the authority to formulate fundamental&#13;
strategic responses such as redefining the mission and&#13;
markets to be in, or creating a major product such as the&#13;
personal computer (IBM, Merrill Lynch, Sears, Dean Witter,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Citicorp). The corporate planners would engage in the&#13;
organization, follow up and provision of support to these&#13;
task forces (primarily composed of senior managers) and draw&#13;
on resources and special skills/knowledge from throughout&#13;
the organization to formulate a new comprehensive strategy;&#13;
this exercise is done periodically and once approved,&#13;
planners work with line management to facilitate its&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Involve multiple dimensions of the organization in strategic&#13;
planning so that strategy formulation can capture the&#13;
totality of potential interactions between the organization&#13;
and its environment and can engage all managers in the&#13;
formulation of their own contributions to the overall&#13;
organization (GM, GE). These dimensions might include:&#13;
functional, product/service, client/market, and regional/&#13;
geographic. However, the primary dimension for such&#13;
planning has been the SBU, which has often been based on&#13;
market/client segmentation.&#13;
(ii) Changes in the modalities of the process&#13;
The above directions in the evolution of strategic planning&#13;
processes suggest a deeper understanding of the nature of strategic&#13;
decisions and of the role of a staff function in facilitating decision&#13;
making. In many organizations where strategic planning has not yet taken&#13;
hold (American President Lines) staff planners are often frustrated by the&#13;
lack of top management attention and response to their analyses. Gaining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
the attention and support of executives appears to be the most difficult&#13;
challenge facing the planning function. "It is difficult to push ideas&#13;
that go against the corporate power structure".  "Managers are fearful that&#13;
formal planning will limit their freedom". "The incentives are based on&#13;
the short-term". "Planning documents are hardly read". The dilemma for&#13;
planners is that although they are subordinate to most executives and&#13;
general managers in terms of authority, they must advise these superiors on&#13;
the most important decisions affecting the institution and must assume some&#13;
control over the decision-making process itself to be influential in&#13;
bringing about more effective decisions.&#13;
The nature of strategic decision making that emerges from this&#13;
review suggests the following:&#13;
Strategic problems are not amenable to simple, sequential problem&#13;
solving; strategic management is like sailing or exploring. The&#13;
executives steer the organization into the unknown future (or&#13;
create its future) by constantly extending their sight ahead and&#13;
making tentative changes and experiments to discover and&#13;
influence this future.&#13;
Strategic planning (and decision making) is a social process of&#13;
communication, negotiation and learning among many managers. It&#13;
is also a political process that involves the realignment of&#13;
interest groups into a coalition for strategic change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
*    Strategic decisions are not purely "rational" or "objective", but&#13;
involve personal and intuitive thinking. They involve&#13;
existential choices, risks and commitments.&#13;
*    In contrast to a formal strategic planning process, strategic&#13;
decision making has important organic qualities. Executives are&#13;
action oriented and ultimately base their decisions on intuition&#13;
rather than complex studies. Strategy formulation is a creatjive&#13;
process; the decision maker continually gathers opinions and&#13;
information and integrates the most useful of them into a mental&#13;
model that is constantly evolving until a choice emerges.&#13;
If the decision-making process is so messy, fluid and&#13;
unstructured, then what role can the planning staff and the planning&#13;
process play? The answer lies in transforming the planning function to&#13;
facilitate, rather than work at cross purposes with the decision making&#13;
process. Although strategic decisions are the result of an organic flow of&#13;
executive thinking and must evolve from an extensive web of interactions,&#13;
the role of the planning process is to facilitate this creative process by&#13;
providing orderly social interactions, tools, information and perspectives&#13;
to foster superior decisions. The recent drive is to keep planning systems&#13;
simple and to use techniques that are easy to grasp. Various methods are&#13;
used to intensify interactions among managers on strategy development (task&#13;
forces, planning conferences, etc.), to stretch imagination and invite&#13;
intuition and judgement (scenarios, contingency planning, brainstorming),&#13;
and to facilitate the flow of ideas and information among otherwise distant&#13;
components of the organization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
This understanding also transforms the role of planners and the&#13;
working relationship between planners and executives. At the progressive&#13;
organizations among the sample surveyed, planners described their role as&#13;
process facilitators who help foster change in the consciousness of&#13;
others. They cultivate "the art of influence" through the generation of&#13;
new ideas, information, perspectives, environmental scanning, perceptions&#13;
and feedbacks from external clients, etc.- They try to cultivate a&#13;
consultant-client relationship similar to independent professionals. They&#13;
seek strategic entry or leverage points and opportunities to provide value&#13;
added. Although planners are tempted to provide the solutions and write&#13;
the planning documents, their most effective role is to assist executives&#13;
by providing them with information and processing capabilities to formulate&#13;
their own judgements. In some firms, planners have taken the role of&#13;
advocates, representing the perspectives (interests) of the executives.&#13;
In others, planners became the advocates of the operating managers. In&#13;
either case, planners are acting to facilitate the thinking and actions of&#13;
management, rather than planning for others or promoting their own&#13;
solutions. They become advisors and catalysts for strategic thinking and a&#13;
focal point for anticipating and facilitating change (see Table 1).&#13;
This understanding suggests that the planning process must be&#13;
driven by line management, and, in particular, that strategy formulation&#13;
and implementation must be led by top management. The CEOs and/or&#13;
executive vice presidents met during the survey described their role as the&#13;
leaders of the overall strategic planning process, giving it the vision,&#13;
the drive, the commitment, the resolve, the legitimacy and the supportive&#13;
culture to ensure its utility as their own primary tool for strategic&#13;
management (IBM, GE, Wang, HP, Marriott, Citicorp, SAS, Volvo and Norwegian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
Management School). Citicorp's strategic planning task force was headed by&#13;
the Senior Vice President who managed the most dynamic and successful&#13;
division. Most of top management time (Senior Operating Officer/or the&#13;
Chief Executive Office, general managers of the major business units) is&#13;
allocated to thinking through and managing strategy development and the&#13;
resolution of strategic issues. The organic and day-to-day informal&#13;
relationships between corporate planners and top management are emphasized.&#13;
Most corporate planning officers are influential vice presidents who report&#13;
directly to the CEO. Central planners are often former line managers who&#13;
have extensive working experience and in-depth understanding of the actual&#13;
working of the organization. The chief planner is so close to the CEO and&#13;
key top managers to be the "alter-ego" and counselor of top management.&#13;
Planning at lower levels exhibits similar characteristics and planning&#13;
staff work very closely with line managers to facilitate the formulation&#13;
and monitoring of line manager plans (see Table 1).&#13;
(b) Integrating Planning With Other Managerial Systems&#13;
In complex organizations, planning alone will never produce the&#13;
massive mobilization of resources and people and will never generate the&#13;
high quality of strategic thinking and response required for success in a&#13;
turbulent environment. Strategic management has, as an ultimate objective,&#13;
the development of organizational responsibilities and administrative&#13;
systems which link strategic and operational decision making at all&#13;
hierarchical levels and across all businesses and functional lines of&#13;
authority in an institution. At this stage of management development, the&#13;
conflicts between long term development and short term performance would be&#13;
explicitly managed and resolved. In our survey, the leading organizations&#13;

have integrated their planning processes with the following management&#13;
systems: organizational structure, resource allocation, communication and&#13;
information systems, and incentive structures. The following sections&#13;
point to some of the lessons learned.&#13;
(i) Link to Organizational Structure&#13;
The planning process is a primary vehicle for systematically&#13;
identifying the major tasks faced by an organization. The organization is&#13;
segmented into responsibility centers (strategic business units and&#13;
operating units) which allows for proper decentralized authority and&#13;
accountability at all levels of the structure. Hence, a common result of&#13;
periodic strategic exercises in many organizations has been to restructure&#13;
them to facilitate the development and implementation of the long term&#13;
directions of the business of the organization; structure follows&#13;
strategy. (Merrill Lynch, Hewlett-Packard, Volvo, First Chicago, GM, IBM,&#13;
Bechtel). The process of adjusting the basic organizational structure&#13;
should be distinguished from ad-hoc organizing and from the detailed or&#13;
micro organizational structuring. The basic restructuring is to reflect&#13;
the major segmentation of the businesses the firm is engaged in by defining&#13;
an hierarchical order which reveals the priorities top management assigns&#13;
to the firm's central activities.&#13;
Organizing for the strategic mode may take various forms, short&#13;
of complete reorganization. The SBU manager may be assigned a permanent&#13;
coordinating role. A second option is to assign to a committee (normally&#13;
composed of the CEO and the top operational managers) the task of&#13;
developing and implementing the necessary strategic programs of SBU's. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
their role as members of the SBU management committee, managers are&#13;
supposed to act on behalf of the institution's ultimate interests, and not&#13;
as parochial defenders of their own areas of operational responsibility. A&#13;
third and most extreme option is to adopt a matrix form of organization for&#13;
dealing with operational and strategic responsibilities.&#13;
In general, strategic planning has been used to foster&#13;
decentralization among large corporations. The development of a strategic&#13;
planning process and the periodic repositioning of the overall organization&#13;
have facilitated, or have been explicitly used to facilitate the delegation&#13;
of authority to more manageable units of the organization. "You cannot&#13;
delegate without a strategic framework". As strategic decisions are taken&#13;
regarding the portfolio of businesses the firm should be in and the long&#13;
term direction of each individual business, the organizational structure is&#13;
realigned to facilitate the allocation of resources among its businesses,&#13;
and to support the implementation of each business strategy. Thus,&#13;
strategic planning has been used to clearly define authority,&#13;
accountability and objectives at each level of the organization.&#13;
(ii) Link to Resource Allocation&#13;
Strategic planning is used to define a strategic framework for&#13;
resource allocation among competing claims, both among businesses and&#13;
between short term performance and long term (institutional) development.&#13;
In the private sector, the use of portfolio matrices has facilitated the&#13;
allocation of strategic funds for potential investments, R &amp; D, and other&#13;
developmental expenses in accordance with clearly-selected portfolios and&#13;
business strategies. Resource allocations often reflect the generic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
strategies selected for each business: invest to increase market share,&#13;
invest to hold position, invest to gradually give up share, and divest to&#13;
exit. A common approach is to allocate the strategic funds directly to the&#13;
SBU's based on the overall priority of each SBU, leaving to the SBU&#13;
managers the assignment of those resources among the individual projects&#13;
(developmental activities) generated at the SBU level. An alternative&#13;
approach is based on central examination of each project (program)&#13;
emanating from the business (operating unit) level and the use of some&#13;
common criterion such as net present value as the basis for funding. In&#13;
many leading organizations, the former approach has been used to provide&#13;
tentative allocation of strategic funds among SBU's according to their&#13;
strategic position in the portfolio. This approach guarantees a strategic&#13;
fit between the allocation of resources and the strategic positioning of&#13;
each SBU.12/&#13;
Although non-profit/public sector organizations may not be able&#13;
to apply these specific criteria and tools, there are some broad concepts&#13;
and lessons that may be transferable. One principle is the progressive&#13;
delegation of resource allocation to SBUs, in accordance with the overall&#13;
strategy of the organization and the priority of the business each SBU is&#13;
in. Only major single investments beyond a certain level would be&#13;
evaluated by levels higher than the SBU management. Another is to clearly&#13;
distinguish and scrutinize the strategic from the operating budgets and to&#13;
devote the attention of top management to improving the allocation of the&#13;
strategic budget. A third is to provide clear performance criteria or&#13;
returns to the organizations from investment in these strategic programs.&#13;
12/ Central approval on a project-by-project basis can often lead to&#13;
incongruencies between the perceived priority of a business and&#13;
resources allocated to it (due to the different behavior regarding the&#13;
generation of projects on the part of the managers in charge of each&#13;
SBU).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Managers at all levels are held responsible for their performance in&#13;
managing these strategic expenses (and not only for the operating budget).&#13;
Finally, strategic planning is distinguished by its emphasis on&#13;
providing strategic criteria for resource allocation (derived from the&#13;
institutional strategy) that depart from marginal, ad hoc or trend&#13;
increases. It ensures that resource allocation decisions are taken in full&#13;
view of the strategies of each business and the long term consequences of&#13;
resource redeployments. Strategic planning tools, such as portfolio&#13;
matrices, are used to examine the contribution of each business in light of&#13;
the institution's competitive position (specific strengths) and the future&#13;
attractiveness (evolution, growth) of this business, and to shift resources&#13;
accordingly. Thus strategic planning enables institutions to concentrate&#13;
their resources on the most promising activities and to withdraw resources&#13;
from old and less productive ones.  "Resources can be productive only if&#13;
they are concentrated; fragmentation inhibits results" (Peter Drucker).&#13;
"Sloughing off yesterday" is particularly important in turbulent times and&#13;
for public service institutions.  They have to think through the changed&#13;
circumstances in which they operate. Precisely because results in service&#13;
organizations are not easily measured, there is a need for organized&#13;
abandonment of marginal and resource-consuming activities of the past. In&#13;
turbulent times an institution needs to be able both to withstand outside&#13;
contingencies and to avail itself of sudden unexpected opportunities.&#13;
Although commonly neglected as a resource for strategic&#13;
allocation purposes, managerial and staff skills, and their knowledge about&#13;
the clients and the environment, are now increasingly recognized as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
scarcest organizational resources. Financial resources are easier to&#13;
measure and redeploy. As Texas Instruments put it, "financial resources&#13;
can be borrowed, but the scarcest resources for us to find are&#13;
entrepreneurial managers and innovative engineers to run our most&#13;
challenging businesses". Not surprisingly, in professional services&#13;
organizations and high-tech companies the highest priority for the&#13;
attention of top management is the recruitment, placement and development&#13;
of human resources. (IBM, Price Waterhouse, Salomon, Citicorp, SRI).&#13;
(iii) Link to Communication and Information Systems&#13;
Various levels of planning must be supported by appropriate&#13;
information systems. The clear delineation of levels (hierarchy) of&#13;
strategies, objectives and responsibilities have been used to structure the&#13;
information flows and communication channels within strategically-managed&#13;
organizations. For strategic planning purposes the focus of the&#13;
information system is reoriented to ensure that the organization is able to&#13;
scan its environment, to detect trends and to provide timely feedback to&#13;
top management on emerging problems. Information systems for top&#13;
management levels are focused primarily on the critical assumptions&#13;
governing strategy formulation and strategic issue resolution. Information&#13;
systems are designed to discriminate relevant information to be made&#13;
available to different levels of the management hierarchy. Similarly,&#13;
information systems developed for lower levels of the management hierarchy&#13;
are shaped by their decision making needs. Information systems are&#13;
designed to provide early detection of opportunities and threats and&#13;
continuous feedback on clear performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Many of the strategically managed organizations have used their&#13;
information system capability to enhance their understanding of their&#13;
clients and improve their ability to provide "value added" to their&#13;
clients (understand the user's total economics). For example, Citicorp has&#13;
used its superior information network and information technology as the&#13;
basis for its competitive advantage and hence its competitive strategy.&#13;
Many organizations have built an extensive network of information channels&#13;
to detect and meet their clients' needs; this has become a strategic&#13;
strength and a decisive competitive advantage (Sears, Salomon, American&#13;
Express, Wang, Merrill Lynch). They have empowered lower level management&#13;
to take actions based on such information. In addition, they devised ways&#13;
to ensure timely detection of patterns of such needs and to bring them to&#13;
the attention of top management for strategic response. Systems are also&#13;
developed to provide information (intelligence) on the objectives,&#13;
strategies and plans of other influential actors in the environment&#13;
(competitors, potential collaborators, strategic allies). Significant&#13;
attention is also given to measure the organization's performance. From a&#13;
strategic point of view, for example, it is not enough to know the firm's&#13;
own cost structure; rather, it is the industry cost structure and the&#13;
firm's relative position in it that is relevant. Service-oriented&#13;
organizations, in particular, have developed an impressive array of&#13;
channels (including local representatives, user surveys, etc.) to assess&#13;
their performance and comparative advantages vis-a-vis other competitors&#13;
and have used these information systems to formulate their own strategies.&#13;
(American Express, American President Lines, Abbott Labs, American&#13;
Airlines).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
Strategic management integrates strategic planning and&#13;
communication systems for the purpose of translating information into&#13;
meaningful messages to both internal and external audiences&#13;
(stakeholders). It develops clear and well defined communications&#13;
strategies. Communications are actively used to facilitate understanding&#13;
of institutional strategies, objectives and plans. The primary thrust of&#13;
these communication processes is the articulation of the central objectives&#13;
and programs the organization is intended to pursue in a way which is&#13;
effective for key external and internal audiences. The purpose is to&#13;
increase the level of understanding and the degree of commitment of the&#13;
organization to its stakeholders and vice versa.&#13;
(iv) Link to Incentive Structure&#13;
Well designed planning processes should include the definition of&#13;
performance measurements which are the essence of management control. In&#13;
operational planning, the continuity between planning, performance&#13;
measurement and control is well understood and more commonly practiced.&#13;
This is not the case, however, in strategic planning. Very often, firms&#13;
resort to the budgeting and financial control systems (developed in stage 1&#13;
of the evolution of strategic planning), thus falling into the trap of&#13;
short-term accounting-driven control instruments. Therefore, the ability&#13;
of the organization to implement, monitor, evaluate and control strategic&#13;
commitments is almost entirely lost. Strategically managed organizations&#13;
devote considerable attention to devising measures of performance and&#13;
control for strategy implementation. Much more creativity is required for&#13;
measuring the long term impact of the chosen strategic plan, and monitoring&#13;
the progress of strategic programs and the deployment of strategic funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Both the budget and the reporting systems are often designed to express&#13;
this dichotomy between operational (for ongoing businesses, short term) and&#13;
strategic accountability (GE, TI).&#13;
Rewards and motivational systems are also devised to allocate&#13;
appropriate weights between short and long term performance. Most&#13;
organizations suffer from the use of short term measures of performance to&#13;
reward high-level managers, who are mainly responsible for imsplementing&#13;
strategic actions (Japanese companies are noted for tempering this bias and&#13;
for emphasizing rewards for long term performance as well). Strategically&#13;
managed organizations are trying to develop more balanced reward systems.&#13;
Among other systems, the strategic factors approach involves the&#13;
identification of the critical success factors governing the future&#13;
performance (profitability) of the business and the assignment of proper&#13;
weights depending on the inherent characteristics of the organizational&#13;
(business) unit and its agreed upon strategy. Some relevant factors might&#13;
include: product quality measures, client-satisfaction/market demand&#13;
measures, productivity levels, product development measures, and personnel&#13;
development measures. More subtle and richer varieties of motivational&#13;
systems are ultimately derived from managing the culture of the firm (see&#13;
the following section).&#13;
In our discussions during the survey, it was often emphasized&#13;
that performance measurement, accountability and incentives are integral to&#13;
the successful implementation of strategies and to the introduction of an&#13;
effective strategic planning process. The difficulty of devising such&#13;
systems was commonly acknowledged, particularly for non-profit service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
organizations. However, it is a necessity for the strategically managed&#13;
organization.&#13;
In summary, the integration between the structure and systems of&#13;
organizations should ensure the continuity of decisions across all&#13;
hierarchical levels, not only in an operational mode, but also in a&#13;
strategic one. Organizational structures are developed not only to allow&#13;
for the efficient execution of day-to-day operational requirements, but&#13;
also to facilitate the implementation of the strategic commitments of the&#13;
organization. Similarly, resource allocation systems are designed to&#13;
distinguish between processes for allocating strategic funds and operating&#13;
funds. Managers are expected to "wear two hats", the first as an operating&#13;
manager concerned with today's operating results and the second as a&#13;
strategic manager concerned with longer range results (TI). Information&#13;
and communication systems are also restructured to guide strategic decision&#13;
making and strategic performance, and to foster an externally-oriented&#13;
outlook. Finally, performance measures, monitoring and evaluation systems&#13;
and incentives are realigned to ensure that strategy formulation and&#13;
implementation are taken seriously.&#13;
B. Strategic Issue Management&#13;
(a) Purpose&#13;
There are three primary reasons for the emergence of strategic&#13;
issue management as a core capability of strategic management. The first&#13;
is to focus management attention on resolving strategy-derived issues as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
they arise from implementing a selected strategic posture. The early&#13;
expectation of strategic planners was to revise strategies annually and&#13;
comprehensively. But experience showed this was impractical and&#13;
unnecessary. Impractical because comprehensive strategy revision is an&#13;
energy and time absorbing exercise which, if conducted annually, overloads&#13;
management or deteriorates into ritual. Annual comprehensive revisions may&#13;
also cause vacillations in managerial behavior and prevent a fair test of&#13;
the strategic posture. Unnecessary, because a comprehensive strategy is a&#13;
long term thrust which takes several years to implement. As this&#13;
understanding grew, organizations began to space comprehensive revisions of&#13;
strategies several years apart (Merrill Lynch, American Express, Sears).&#13;
In the beginning of the annual planning cycle, a review of last year's&#13;
progress focuses attention on business areas (SBU's) which have encountered&#13;
important strategic issues (changes in basic assumptions underlying their&#13;
business strategies, new threats and opportunities, difficulties in&#13;
strategy implementation). In this context, issue analysis becomes the&#13;
heart of an on-going process of planning and implementation of a&#13;
comprehensive and long term strategic posture.&#13;
A second reason for issue management is to resolve&#13;
environmentally-derived issues. Strategic issues would arise from&#13;
environmental scanning, identification of trends, and emerging&#13;
environmental threats. These signals are examined in terms of their impact&#13;
on future organizational goals and performance. In this context, issues&#13;
can be thought of as the stresspoints resulting from the clash between the&#13;
organization and its continuously shifting environment, Issues are not&#13;
always threats, but may also pose unusual opportunities. For example, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
decision of IBM to enter the exploding personal computer market was a major&#13;
issue.&#13;
The third reason for the growing importance of issue management&#13;
has been the growing incidence of surprise events which come from&#13;
unexpected sources and impact quickly on the organization. The combination&#13;
of speed and novelty of such issues make them less amenable to a regular,&#13;
calendar-driven planning cycle. Time is of the essence; early detection of&#13;
these issues, and their resolution at the appropriate level (top&#13;
management) is critical to the quality and effectiveness of institutional&#13;
response. In this context, it becomes desirable to separate issue&#13;
resolution from the annual planning cycle.&#13;
The above suggests that issues may arise both in the context of&#13;
comprehensive strategy development in an annual planning process and the&#13;
context of continuous surveillance of the environment. They can therefore&#13;
be partly addressed within an agile and issue-focused annual strategic&#13;
planning process. However, there is a growing differentiation between the&#13;
two processes, particularly in enterprises whose basic strategic thrusts&#13;
are clear and relatively stable, but whose environments are turbulent.&#13;
Regardless of variations among the organizations surveyed, almost&#13;
all of them have orderly systems for issue identification, analysis, and&#13;
management. It was often reported that top management, which constitutes&#13;
the "issue management team", is spending more than half of its time on this&#13;
process. Top management time is considered the scarcest resource of an&#13;
organization; the role of planning staff is to structure the time and focus&#13;
the attention of the top team on managing the fundamentals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 - -&#13;
(b) What is a strategic issue?&#13;
There is no generic list of strategic issues that can be relevant&#13;
to all types of organizations. There are, however, three basic sources of&#13;
information about impending strategic issues: trends in the external&#13;
environment, trends in the internal environment, and trends in&#13;
organizational performance. Large and complex organizations have&#13;
developed advanced capabilities for environmental surveillance, for&#13;
tracking internal developments, and for monitoring institutional&#13;
performance. Particular attention is given to possible major future&#13;
discontinuity which might have a major impact on the organization.&#13;
The following criteria might be used in identifying and screening&#13;
strategic issues for top management consideration:&#13;
a.   present or potential impact on institutional&#13;
performance/strategy implementation;&#13;
b.   urgency;&#13;
c.   impact on other issues/organizational units.&#13;
(c) What is a Strategic Issue Management (SIM) Process?&#13;
Strategic issue management anticipates, assigns priorities and&#13;
systematically manages the resolution of issues. An SIM process is a&#13;
disciplined procedure for early identification, fast response, and&#13;
systematic follow-up on changes both within and outside the institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Early identification can be assured in the following ways:&#13;
(i) Unlike the annual strategic planning process, SIM is a&#13;
continuous "real-time" process. In many organizations, this&#13;
means a periodic (monthly) review and updating of a key&#13;
strategic issues list.&#13;
(ii)  It also means continuous surveillance, both inside and&#13;
outside the organization, to detect emerging threats and&#13;
opportunities and the continuous sifting of signals for top&#13;
management attention.&#13;
Fast response to trends can be assured in the following ways:&#13;
(i)  A staff group facilitates the consolidation and screening of&#13;
issues, elicits issue identification from relevant sources&#13;
throughout the organization, frames these issues in a&#13;
standard format that facilitates the examination of options&#13;
and action, and chairs task forces to examine&#13;
cross-departmental issues.&#13;
(ii)  The responsibility for managing the process is assumed by a&#13;
senior management group which has the resources and&#13;
authority to initiate prompt action without unnecessary&#13;
delays. In practice, this group is often the executive&#13;
management committee (Kodak), the strategic planning&#13;
committee (Sears), or the policy committee (IBM). In other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
organizations such as Bechtel, there are several overlapping&#13;
strategic issue management committees that address issues&#13;
confronting different businesses or key functional areas.&#13;
Such committees are empowered with the authority to take&#13;
actions on all the strategic issues in their areas.&#13;
(iii) Particularly among entrepreneurially-managed organizations,&#13;
SIM cuts across hierarchical levels and assigns&#13;
responsibility for individual issues directly to units which&#13;
are best equipped to deal with the issue. When an issue is&#13;
not particular to a managerial unit (most often), and ad hoc&#13;
project (task force) is formed, resources are directly&#13;
assigned to the project, and progress is monitored and&#13;
reported directly to senior management.&#13;
(iv) The SIM is action-oriented. In many organizations this&#13;
means that the assigned responsibilities are not for&#13;
planning the response but for acting on the issue. The&#13;
usual separation between planning and implementation periods&#13;
is not visible and experimentation is often the mode for&#13;
testing options for issue resolution (particularly among&#13;
bureaucracies). Unless explicitly guarded against, SIM may&#13;
degenerate into "paralysis by repeated analysis".&#13;
Systematic follow-up can be assured in the following ways:&#13;
(i) A "staff" group is made responsible for maintaining an up to&#13;
date display of the key issues list, their priorities and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
the status of the task forces (change projects). The group&#13;
is also responsible for ensuring that completed studies are&#13;
fully implemented, or, when necessary, adapted throughout&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(ii)  Particularly for bureaucracies and socio-political&#13;
organizations, many issues are complex and unstructured and&#13;
cannot be resolved "in one shot". Moreover, many task force&#13;
recommendations and action projects are left half done and&#13;
never meet their original objectives. In such cases, there&#13;
is a need to revisit issues and to resolve them in a&#13;
progressive and persistent manner. Moreover, urgent issues&#13;
may be addressed by task forces before their dimensions and&#13;
implications are fully understood. The early stages will&#13;
progressively make clear the strategic dimensions of the&#13;
issue: the extent of its impact and its urgency. The SIM&#13;
process provides the focus and discipline to manage a&#13;
complex agenda of issues and to follow up on a large number&#13;
of on-going task forces and organizational change projects.&#13;
(iii)  Senior management usually exercise strategic control over&#13;
the task forces or project teams, and give them sufficient&#13;
autonomy, guidance, and support. The design, use, and&#13;
management of task forces have become important tools for&#13;
managing organizational change and enhancing responsiveness&#13;
to fast changing external environments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
(d) Modalities of the SIM Process&#13;
Strategic issue management and the strategic planning process&#13;
must be linked together in at least two ways. The first is through the&#13;
inclusion of issues of moderate urgency in the annual planning process.&#13;
Issues generated from the SIM process are thus incorporated into the annual&#13;
planning guidelines and addressed by the relevant SBUs. The second is&#13;
through the issues and strategies generated by the annual planning process&#13;
itself which can be consolidated and analyzed as high priority&#13;
institutional issues for SIM consideration.&#13;
Various tools and formats have been developed to assist in SIM.&#13;
The objectives of these tools are to assess the impact and urgency of&#13;
trends and to analyze their interdependence. Trends and issues usually&#13;
arise and form a cluster of interdependent problems. Cross-impact analysis&#13;
may be used to identify clusters of events/trends which are likely to&#13;
impact on the organization so they could be confronted or exploited. The&#13;
recent trend is to use more creative and interactive processes for issue&#13;
identification, such as scenario building (Shell, NCR, SRI). In this&#13;
context, scenarios are used to span the plausible envelope of uncertainties&#13;
that bear upon the strategic issues or decisions of the organizations.&#13;
They can help clarify likely threats and opportunities and the significant&#13;
developments that managers and planners need to watch and review on a&#13;
regular basis. Such processes could improve on the generation of strategic&#13;
issues for senior management consideration. Such interactive methods can&#13;
be designed to induce change in the corporate culture by encouraging new&#13;
ways of thinking about the future, by seeking to stretch the search for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 - -&#13;
plausible futures, and by surfacing assumptions and basic beliefs for&#13;
examination by top management.&#13;
Corporations naturally take varying approaches to issues&#13;
management. Some companies have created new positions or groups of issues-&#13;
managers, separate from the corporate planners. At some, an issues manager&#13;
organizes a committee of middle managers and relevant staff to do the&#13;
analysis, with the results sent to top executives. At others, like&#13;
Hewlett-Packard and Wang, the corporate planner or the advisor to the CEO&#13;
organizes issue-oriented task forces.  Other companies, such as Arco and&#13;
Sears, have large staffs of full-time issues managers. In some cases,&#13;
issues managers try to build a consensus among operating units before the&#13;
issues get to top corporate management. The common use of "issue&#13;
management" is to alert executive management to emerging trends, threats&#13;
and opportunities, and to help mobilize the company's resources to deal&#13;
with them. It is seen as a "pre-crisis approach". "Single-line numbers&#13;
forecasting, typically done by economic planners, did not predict the oil&#13;
crisis or the environmental revolution. We need a wider, more qualitative&#13;
approach to supplement the traditional forecasting techniques" (Arco).&#13;
Perhaps the most important prerequisite for the effective&#13;
functioning of a SIM process is the role and group dynamics of top&#13;
management. At first glance, SIM appears to be an easy system to put in&#13;
place and to manage; it is lean, with a minimum of paperwork and mechanics;&#13;
it is complementary to and compatible with periodic planning processes; and&#13;
it addresses pressing problems with a minimum of routines.  However, SI!H-&#13;
not simple to operate and requires support from top management and the&#13;
organizational culture; it is not the staff's but the top managers'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
process. One common source of difficulty is the refusal of the top&#13;
management group to submit itself to the discipline of SIM. While periodic&#13;
planning is frequently used for organizing "others", SIM requires top&#13;
management to become part of the process. Another often mentioned&#13;
difficulty is the resistance of top management to accept new and unfamiliar&#13;
issues as relevant to running their business. One way to engage managers&#13;
in the process of generating these issues is to involve top management in&#13;
scenario development. To enhance its acceptability, the SIM may start&#13;
first by addressing those issues that are ranked highest by few key members&#13;
of the top management group. One or more top managers may periodically put&#13;
on "staff hats" and become engaged on a part-time basis in managing the&#13;
"issue agenda", with the support of the planning staff.&#13;
In companies which emphasize consensus management and where&#13;
"issue management" is effective, the chairman usually play a crucial role&#13;
in maintaining the process honest and open while ensuring final resolution&#13;
of issues and accountability for implementation. In such cases, the&#13;
powerful members of the top management group assume the role of "patrons"&#13;
of the process and use it collectively to drive the organization. Issues&#13;
are then considered on their merits and examined collectively by the group;&#13;
"once they step into those meetings, they take off their territorial hats&#13;
(functional turfs) and put on their institutional hats". In some cases,&#13;
corporations have sought external help from process consultants to ensure&#13;
the smooth and effective use of this process and to help build "a team&#13;
spirit" and to develop a climate that is safe for risk taking and open to&#13;
candid examination of the gut issues facing the organization. Without&#13;
engendering a supportive climate for confronting issues and "thinking the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
unthinkable", task forces and planning staff would tend to obfuscate rather&#13;
than clarify the strategic issues and options, and top management would&#13;
tend to inhibit innovative and non-marginal responses.&#13;
C. Culture Management&#13;
(a) Managing the Corporate Culture&#13;
Strategy needs not only to be congruent with the organizational&#13;
structure and the key administrative processes but also has to be&#13;
integrated within and supported by the corporate culture. The findings of&#13;
"In Search of Excellence" and numerous other studies suggest the critical&#13;
role of the style of top management and shared values (or superordinate&#13;
goals) in shaping the organization's strategic and operating behavior. The&#13;
style of management, reflected in the way it collectively spends time and&#13;
attention and uses symbolic behavior, provides tangible evidence of what&#13;
management considers important.  In this sense, it is not what management&#13;
says is important, it is the way management behaves. The mix of staff&#13;
(demographics) and skills (disciplines and experiences) also shape the&#13;
corporate culture. Culture is transmitted and shaped in many ways:&#13;
statements of philosophy and vision, deliberate role modeling and coaching&#13;
by leaders, explicit rewards and promotion criteria, symbolic events, what&#13;
leaders attend to and control, what criteria are used for recruitment,&#13;
selection, promotion, leveling off and "excommunication" of people,&#13;
information and communication systems, etc. Some leading corporations have&#13;
conducted cultural analysis and cultural audits to unveil the operating and&#13;
behavioral principles governing the organization, and how the organization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
relates to its clients, how it manages time, how its members relate to each&#13;
other, etc. In general, our survey has underlined that a supportive&#13;
culture is fundamental in moving strategic planning away from being a&#13;
mechanical and abstract activity towards becoming a driving force and a way&#13;
of life in an organization.&#13;
One common and simple differentiation between organizational&#13;
cultures is whether it is inward or outward looking. Outward-looking&#13;
cultures prevent complacency and rigidity by adhering to an obsession with&#13;
some facet of their performance in the marketplace such as "excellence in&#13;
servicing the customer". Inward-focused culture, by contrast, place a&#13;
premium on internal priorities and procedures. Another dimension is the&#13;
strength of a culture, which may be defined as the extent to which it has&#13;
an influence on behavior. Among the key determinants of cultural strength&#13;
are how long people have lived and worked in it (culture is formed from&#13;
experience and learning), how many shared values and basic beliefs exist&#13;
and how widely they are shared, and how clear are the priorities among&#13;
these values when conflict arises.&#13;
Cultural characteristics have fundamental implications for the&#13;
openness of the organization to influence and/or adjust to the&#13;
environment. a case in point is how does the strength of an organizational&#13;
culture influence its ability to play a catalytic role or engage in joint&#13;
ventures with other autonomous institutions. Sufficient cultural strength&#13;
is needed to withstand external adversity and to sustain values that&#13;
conflict with those in the external environment. On the other hand, strong&#13;
but inward-looking cultures could militate against cooperation, make it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
difficult to compromise and may become counterproductive as circumstances&#13;
change. The basic guiding rule is to develop a strong culture that derives&#13;
its stability or source of change from the needs of the customer.&#13;
The growing awareness of the corporate culture as a constraint or&#13;
a driving force is generally accepted, even by some of the most hard-headed&#13;
corporations (GE, IBM, HP, 3M, Volvo). There is a growing trend among&#13;
strategically managed organizations to shape their culture to become&#13;
supportive of strategic thinking and entrepreneurial behavior. Senior&#13;
Management is engaged in shaping appropriate and strong cultures to meet&#13;
the challenges of their business; IBM culture "is so pervasive that leaving&#13;
the company is like emigrating". To start with, the first step of the&#13;
strategic planning process (the definition of the mission or purpose of the&#13;
firm) is not used as a rhetorical exercise in issuing empty platitudes.&#13;
Rather, statements of corporate missions become the joint output of a&#13;
visionary leader and the product of much involvement and conviction by the&#13;
major stakeholders. They are stated and communicated in a way that goes&#13;
beyond the pragmatic functions of the organization. They become essential&#13;
for creating the "spirit" and vision that energize the organization and&#13;
give it a sense of purpose.&#13;
Survey findings suggest that in strategically managed&#13;
organizations top management has assumed a central role in communicating&#13;
the basic strategic roles of an organization to its various stakeholders.&#13;
Strategy would be unlikely to become a driving and motivating force if it&#13;
were treated as a top secret and highly confidential matter that could be&#13;
trusted only to a select few. Top management not only serve as the key&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
architect for shaping the strategy of the firm, but equally important, it&#13;
devotes substantial time and effort to communicating the organization's&#13;
strategic thrusts to all levels of the organizations. This aspect of&#13;
cultural management has recently received significant attention from&#13;
American firms, particularly after recognizing the strengths that their&#13;
Japanese counterparts have enjoyed in this area, and the significant&#13;
competitive advantage resulting from that strength. At progressive&#13;
Japanese corporations, top management views its role as one of managing the&#13;
culture and of recruiting, rewarding and coaching other managers to ensure&#13;
that these managers can formulate and implement strategies that are&#13;
appropriate to the chosen culture and the environment. It is interesting&#13;
to note, moreover, that many European firms, particularly the Scandinavian&#13;
ones, have placed a strong emphasis on developing corporate cultures that&#13;
are congruent with their strategies and on using these cultures as the main&#13;
driving force for implementation.&#13;
In most of the strategically managed organizations we visited,&#13;
the processes for defining missions and selecting strategies are led by top&#13;
management, and particularly by the CEO. A significant amount of the time&#13;
of top management is spent not only on strategy development and objective&#13;
setting, but also in simplifying, clarifying and communicating objectives&#13;
and strategies throughout the organization (Volvo, SAS, IBM, GE). In some&#13;
of the professional organizations, such as the Norwegian Management School,&#13;
the process involved as much bottom-up as top-down communication and&#13;
interaction before missions, strategies and priorities ultimately emerged.&#13;
The process was guided by a leader who engaged the imagination and energies&#13;
of a highly professional organization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 - -&#13;
The above concern with strategizing and communicating choices in&#13;
an open way may present a dilemma for public and political organizations&#13;
which are subject to diverse external interest groups and scrutiny. The&#13;
Harvard Business School (HBS) suggests an example where mission and&#13;
strategy formulation were managed differently for its different&#13;
constituencies. What is important, even in this example, is that strategic&#13;
planning is conducted openly among the top management as a team and that,&#13;
once a strategy is decided, it must be communicated effectively and&#13;
purposefully to the various concerned constituencies. In the case of HBS,&#13;
the planning process had to move around the rather individualistic aspects&#13;
of the institution's culture and to avoid threatening the autonomy of its&#13;
major stakeholders (the faculty).&#13;
More fundamentally, strategic management attempts to transform&#13;
the institution and its systems rather than to introduce strategic planning&#13;
as an appendage to traditional, hierarchical, bureaucratic institutions.&#13;
Effective strategic planning requires willingness to deal with ambiguity&#13;
and to address non-marginal choices. "If you don't like to take chances,&#13;
you won't do well here" (Citicorp). People management is given centre&#13;
stage; team work, involvement and commitment are nurtured and rewarded.&#13;
Management is engaged in nurturing creativity and a passion for&#13;
excellence. The eleventh Commandment at 3M is "thou shalt not kill a new&#13;
product idea". The Hewlett-Packard way is "a chance to learn by making&#13;
mistakes". Communication is actively used to secure understanding and&#13;
ensure identification of all staff with institutional objectives and&#13;
strategies. This does not involve the production of thick planning&#13;
documents; it involves the creation of various forums and professional&#13;
group interactions to reach all members of the organization (Salomon).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
Senior management is open, accessible, and in touch; "management by walking&#13;
around" (Hewlett-Packard) is more than a popular idea. The most&#13;
fundamental aspect of this transformation is to create organic&#13;
entrepreneurial networks.&#13;
Many leading corporations have been engaged in creating flexible&#13;
"entrepreneurial networks" of small, self organizing business units that&#13;
employ participative forms of leadership (such as GE, HP, SAS, Solomon and&#13;
other high technology or service-oriented firms). The corporation is&#13;
slowly being transformed from a hierarchical pyramid into a loosely&#13;
connected system of individual entrepreneurs who collaborate in solving&#13;
their strategic problems at the grassroots level. In this organizational&#13;
context, strategic decision making is becoming more "participative" because&#13;
managers must interact more directly to foster the knowledge and "spirit"&#13;
that ultimately nurture innovation and excellence. Executives are&#13;
increasingly focusing their efforts on encouraging collaboration,&#13;
developing new institutional roles, resolving critical issues, facilitating&#13;
the contacts with external constituencies and fostering synergy.&#13;
Executives are also providing more personal leadership to unit managers by&#13;
offering advice and ensuring accountability. Rather than being the boss in&#13;
the traditional sense, the executive is becoming more of a coach, teacher&#13;
and catalyst..."We are trying to reshape GE in the minds of its employees&#13;
as a band of small businesses...to take the strength of a large company and&#13;
act with the agility of a small company". This institutional model is also&#13;
conducive to an external orientation that fosters collaboration with&#13;
clients, playing catalytic roles, and forging strategic ventures with other&#13;
actors in the environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
The strategically managed organization described above can be&#13;
thought of as a "mega-strategy" or a higher level strategy that transcends&#13;
strategic planning to create a new type of organization especially good at&#13;
fostering strategic change and entrepreneurial innovation. As such,&#13;
strategic management is an ideal that has been realized only partially in&#13;
some of the leading organizations we surveyed. Therefore, organizations&#13;
can only strive constantly towards the pursuit of this vision of&#13;
management. Change towards this mode takes a significant period;&#13;
consolidation and integration of strategic planning into the systems and&#13;
culture of the organization is a long-term and continuous process.&#13;
(b) Planning and Managing "Capability Transformation"&#13;
The above discussion has focused on strategic management as an&#13;
institutionalized capacity for managing strategic change and fulfilling&#13;
future objectives and strategies. This section is concerned with planning&#13;
the development of specific capabilities within an organization to fulfill&#13;
a selected strategy. In this context, a strategy is a long term thrust&#13;
which implies substantial changes in roles and capabilities, and may&#13;
involve several years of implementation. The section concludes with some&#13;
ideas about managing institutional resistance to changes in strategies and&#13;
capabilities.&#13;
Strategic management concerns itself simultaneously with both the&#13;
strategy and the kinds of capabilities needed to support this strategy.&#13;
Explicit consideration and planning for these capabilities are essential&#13;
when the selected (necessary) strategy implies a significant dis,continuity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
or departure from historical strengths and historical management&#13;
capability. The experience of most organizations which have practiced&#13;
strategic planning has. shown that the implementation of strategy does not&#13;
automatically follow strategy formulation. When some firms diversified&#13;
from within (internal development) into new products and markets, the&#13;
organization exhibited resistance to the new departures; costs were&#13;
underestimated, benefits were overestimated, and delays frustrated the&#13;
planners and managers. Other corporations which grew and diversified by&#13;
acquisitions have often been disappointed; new acquisitions turned&#13;
unprofitable, cultures clashed between the parent and acquired firms, and&#13;
the synergies anticipated from mergers failed to materialize. Moreover,&#13;
the experience of many organizations suggested that the treatment of&#13;
strategy planning and implementation as two sequential and independent&#13;
processes is an artificial convenience which neglects the fact that the way&#13;
planning is done has a determining effect on the eventual implementability&#13;
of planning decisions.&#13;
The measures used to plan "capability transformation" are similar&#13;
to those discussed above (under integrating planning with other managerial&#13;
systems and with the culture). The main difference here is in making&#13;
specific changes in planning and budgeting systems, in communication and&#13;
information, in controls and rewards, and in the culture, to support the&#13;
long term strategic thrusts of the organization. Another difference is in&#13;
developing specific skills and attitudes among the managerial cadre and the&#13;
staff to carry out their new roles and tasks and to develop the new&#13;
instruments and action programs for implementing the selected strategy.&#13;
People management and management development systems (selection, placement,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
training, reward) assume paramount importance for overall corporate&#13;
capability realignment with strategy. The organizational structure of the&#13;
institution must be also realigned to support its strategy and intended&#13;
behavior. Roles, authority structures and accountabilities are redefined&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
Four generic options are available to deal with the question of&#13;
compatibility between strategy and culture:&#13;
(i) ignore the culture, which has often led to disappointing&#13;
results;&#13;
(ii) manage around the culture by changing implementation&#13;
(choosing the "second best" solution);&#13;
(iii)  change the strategy to fit the culture, perhaps by reducing&#13;
performance expectations; this is often the adopted option&#13;
in strategically planned organizations;&#13;
(iv)  change the culture to fit the strategy; this is the emerging&#13;
choice among strategically managed organizations. This is a&#13;
difficult task to accomplish and must be led by the CEO and&#13;
coordinated with all the necessary and mutually reinforcing&#13;
internal changes in management systems and organizational&#13;
structure. In the most progressive and entrepreneurially&#13;
managed organizations, culture is used as the driving force&#13;
for managing change; other management systems and structures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
follow the cultural transformation, or are used to reinforce&#13;
it, (Volvo, SAS).&#13;
The process of "capability transformation" almost inevitably&#13;
faces resistance. Like resistance to the introduction of strategic&#13;
planning, resistance to capability transformation is not a superficial&#13;
phenomenon; it has a logic of its own, and it cannot be removed by&#13;
exhortation from top managers. It occurs whenever an organizational&#13;
strategy implies a discontinuous departure from historical behavior, power&#13;
structure, skill mix and institutional and managerial roles. Resistance&#13;
manifests itself in procrastination, slow change performance lag,&#13;
bureaucratizing change instruments, paralysis by analysis, lack of&#13;
implementation follow up, etc. It also manifests itself in the elimination&#13;
of significant and bold options.&#13;
Strategically-managed organizations have become increasingly&#13;
sophisticated in developing procedures for the effective management of the&#13;
transformation process from the historical to the new capability-strategy.&#13;
To assure an optimal transition to the new capability, the change process&#13;
is managed in a way that anticipates, minimizes and controls resistance.&#13;
As a first step in managing change, a preliminary diagnosis is conducted of&#13;
the nature of change in capability needed to support the strategy. This&#13;
diagnosis also determines the units which will be affected by the change,&#13;
the key groups and individuals who will support/resist change, the reasons&#13;
for their positions, and their relative importance for the success of the&#13;
proposed change. The result of this diagnosis is a "readiness assessment"&#13;
or a "resistance map".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
Using this map, measures can be taken to build a supportive&#13;
environment and to eliminate unnecessary resistance that may be due to&#13;
misperceptions and fears. Progressive organizations invest significant&#13;
time and effort to ensure adequate communication and information about the&#13;
strategy, with special attention to the affected units and groups.&#13;
Varieties of measures are used to build a pro-change power base, such as&#13;
forming coalitions and offering incentives. In addition, behavioral&#13;
features may be designed into the plan for change such as including in&#13;
decision making all individuals who will be involved in implementing the&#13;
change. To the extent time permits, change is started with groups who are&#13;
committed to the change; rewarding and recognizing them can facilitate the&#13;
spread of change to other units. Participants in the change process should&#13;
be provided with the necessary new concepts and skills. Action programs&#13;
and "capability change" projects are often formulated to support and&#13;
sustain the new strategy.&#13;
In our survey, we observed that progressive organizations have&#13;
placed increasing attention on building implementability into planning.&#13;
More attention is given to this in European firms, particularly in&#13;
Scandinavia (Volvo, SAS, Norwegian Management School) than in the U.S. Top&#13;
management invests considerable effort to ensure behavioral acceptance of&#13;
new strategies. Exemplary behavior by top management in its daily work is&#13;
considered crucial in communicating its commitment to the new strategy.&#13;
The Japanese approach is similar: concern with behavioral acceptance of&#13;
new strategies from the very beginning of the decision process; and early&#13;
launching of experiments and change projects before planring is completed,&#13;
resulting in parallel planning/implementation activity. (WANG, with a&#13;
Chinese CEO, came closest to this approach).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Our review of external planning practices indicates that leading&#13;
organizations have evolved their planning processes, transformed the focus&#13;
and modalities of these processes and integrated them into other management&#13;
systems and structures over time. The evolution of planning practices also&#13;
suggests that time is of the essence and that effective organizations must&#13;
learn to plan as well as plan to learn. Particularly since 1980, and in&#13;
response to an accelerating rate of change and increasing competition, some&#13;
leading organizations have adopted a new mode of strategic planning, called&#13;
"strategic management". Viewed as an ideal, strategic management is only&#13;
partially realized in progressive organizations. These organizations have&#13;
become committed to strive constantly towards the realization of this form&#13;
of management. Strategic management has come to be seen as an essential&#13;
goal for organizations to learn and develop, to maintain their excellence,&#13;
to remain responsive, even to survive.&#13;
Survey findings indicate that present planning practices at the&#13;
leading organizations have built upon and transformed earlier forms of&#13;
planning. Starting with budgeting and financial controls, organizations&#13;
have developed measures for setting productivity targets, transparent cost&#13;
structures, appropriate base for unbundling and pricing their services,&#13;
responsibility centers, and internal incentives and markets to enhance&#13;
competitiveness. Lacking a long-term perspective, however, the main&#13;
pitfall of this planning mode is excessive myopia and an absence of&#13;
meaningful incentives and performance indicators for strategic adaptation.&#13;
Long-range planning was then adopted and was driven by multi-year forecasts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
of demand. While this mode may have been appropriate in a period of fast&#13;
growth and in a stable environment, it proved inadequate as the environment&#13;
grew less certain and more competitive, and as markets and clients could&#13;
not be taken for granted. Planners have focussed their attention on&#13;
forecasting techniques and on predicting rather than creating future&#13;
demand.&#13;
Subsequently, planning had to become externally oriented and&#13;
strategic planning emerged with some powerful concepts and tools to provide&#13;
this orientation. In particular, the businesses of a corporation are&#13;
segmented into distinctive strategic business areas and the organization is&#13;
restructured along strategic business units (SBUs) that are responsible for&#13;
developing the firm's position in one or more of these areas. Segmentation&#13;
has become a common tool for giving a clearly organized view of present and&#13;
future environments and for differentiating the strategies of the&#13;
organization to meet the increasing diversity of the roles it should play&#13;
and the clients it should serve. Portfolio matrices are employed to&#13;
position each business (domain) in accordance with the attractiveness of&#13;
the industry and the competitive strength of the firm in this particular&#13;
business. These tools provide a common framework for establishing&#13;
priorities among businesses in the portfolio and for developing distinctive&#13;
strategies for their repositioning in view of the changing structure of the&#13;
industry and the critical success (internal) factors that must be&#13;
influenced. Strategy formulation processes were progressively&#13;
differentiated into corporate, business (SBU) and functional levels, with&#13;
each level determining the broad directions and thrusts of the next. The&#13;
overall strategic planning process has become an encompassing tool for&#13;
engaging all business (SBU) and functional managers in formulating their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
qwn strategies, and subsequently their plans and budgets, in response to&#13;
the corporate mission, internal scrutiny of strengths and weaknesses,&#13;
environmental scanning of threats and opportunities, and the overall&#13;
corporate posture. Scenarios have been used to provide a common world view&#13;
and a coherent set of planning assumptions for the development of a&#13;
corporate strategy and subsequently, the business (SBU) and functional&#13;
strategies.&#13;
Strategic planning tools and processes have rendered the strategy&#13;
formulation process transparent, encouraged differentiation of business&#13;
strategies to meet the needs of diverse environments and clients, and&#13;
provided feedback on and accountability for strategy management at&#13;
organizational levels closer to the market. Over time, it introduced a&#13;
discipline for long-term thinking, increased awareness about the diversity&#13;
and fast changing character of the environment and possible threats and&#13;
opportunities from competitors. In general, it educated operating managers&#13;
in strategic thinking and prepared them for more general management&#13;
functions. However, tendencies towards bureaucratization, ritualization&#13;
and isolation of the strategic planning function prompted its&#13;
transformation into a new mode, called strategic management.&#13;
Strategic management involves a strategic planning process that&#13;
is issue-focused, selective, opportunity seeking, and highly interactive.&#13;
It puts more emphasis on qualitative and creative thinking and uses&#13;
strategies as frameworks for guiding all choices rather than as "blueprint"&#13;
plans for detailed controls. It complements the cyclical and formal&#13;
processes with ad-hoc and flexible means of organizing and responding on a&#13;
continuous basis. In addition to changing the structure, strategic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
management is striving to transform the modalities of the strategic&#13;
planning process. In particular, the role of institutional planners is to&#13;
facilitate and foster superior strategic decisions and creative choices by&#13;
providing information, tools, perspectives, interactive processes and&#13;
stimulation to executive and line managers. This implies close and&#13;
informal working relationships between planners and managers, at times as&#13;
advisors and "process consultants", and at times as advocates, stimulators&#13;
and even intellectual challengers (see Table 1, page 50).&#13;
The strategic planning process is also integrated with other&#13;
management structures and processes. At many progressive organizations the&#13;
strategic planning process is used to realign the organizational structure&#13;
in terms of emerging or redefined strategic business areas and to&#13;
facilitate decentralization. It is linked to strategic resource allocation&#13;
and is used to provide a framework for the allocation of strategic&#13;
resources (including staff) according to clear priorities among businesses&#13;
and selected strategies for their repositioning. The strategic planning&#13;
process is also linked to the organization's information and communication&#13;
systems and is used to shape the orientation and focus of these systems; a&#13;
premium is put on understanding the client and the overall industry&#13;
structure, and on communicating well defined objectives and strategies to&#13;
both internal and external audiences. Finally, strategic planning is&#13;
linked to the incentive structure and control systems to ensure that the&#13;
institution can motivate, monitor, evaluate, and control strategic&#13;
commitments and can balance rewards for the opportunistic and short-term&#13;
with the strategic and longer-term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
Strategic management introduces a new dimension to planning&#13;
commonly called "strategic issue management". Strategic issue management&#13;
focuses top management attention on key issues arising from implementation&#13;
of the strategic posture of the institution (strategy-derived), from&#13;
emerging environmental threats and opportunities (environmentally-derived)&#13;
and from unexpected (surprise) events. The processes employed for issue&#13;
management must be simple and flexible and must assure early identification&#13;
of issues, fast response, action-orientation, and systematic follow up. At&#13;
strategically-managed companies, the issue management team is the top&#13;
management, with the chief corporate planner acting as agenda manager. The&#13;
debate on issues is conducted in an open and candid way and in deliberating&#13;
and acting on the issues, team members assume overall corporate, rather&#13;
than territorial responsibilities. The corporate planners facilitate the&#13;
identification and examination of the issues, organize task forces and&#13;
mobilize institutional resources to further clarify or act on the issues&#13;
and ensure selectivity and persistance in addressing the difficult&#13;
strategic issues facing the institution.&#13;
Strategic management emphasizes culture and people management,&#13;
"transformational" leadership, communication and clarity of mission and&#13;
objectives, entrepreneurship and risk taking, and support for learning and&#13;
external interaction. It fosters an organizational climate that&#13;
facilitates the implementation of the strategic thrusts of the institution&#13;
and that induces strategic behavior in general. It nurtures an&#13;
outward-looking and strong culture and transmits the fundamental values of&#13;
the institution through role modeling, recognition, symbolic events,&#13;
communication systems and incentives. It offers meaning and a sense of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
involvement and mission; it gives staff confidence (to innovate, for&#13;
instance) stemming from stable expectations about what really counts. It&#13;
combines a firm central direction (value driven) with maximum individual&#13;
autonomy and attention to the client.&#13;
Finally, strategic management plans and manages capability&#13;
transformation to realign present capability and culture with the chosen&#13;
strategic thrusts. It acknowledges that resistance to strategic thinking&#13;
and to capability realignment with environmental change are not superficial&#13;
phenomena to be removed by exhortation. It manages change in a way that&#13;
anticipates, minimizes and control resistance. It diagnoses the nature of&#13;
required capability changes, determines their impact on different groups,&#13;
develops a "resistance map" and then engages in building coalitions for&#13;
these changes. It empowers participants with the necessary concepts and&#13;
skills to initiate their change experiments and provides appropriate&#13;
incentives and a supportive environment to sustain their commitment. Early&#13;
launching of experiments and "capability change" projects is used to create&#13;
"facts" and demonstration effects, to provide feedback to planning, and to&#13;
enable the institution to learn as it plans.&#13;

A METHODOLOGICAL NOTE&#13;
Table 1 covers the organizations visited by the review team,&#13;
which comes to about 90 organizations, equally distributed between the USA&#13;
and Europe., Interviews were short and limited to the chief planners&#13;
(usually a V.P.); in a few cases it involved the CEO. The coverage was&#13;
intended to provide more breadth than depth; follow up was expected for&#13;
in-depth interviews with various levels of managers and planners within few&#13;
selected comparator organizations.&#13;
All organizations covered by the survey were asked to describe&#13;
their basic planning approach and their experience with institutionalizing&#13;
planning. In particular:&#13;
Â°      1. What is the basic purpose(s) of planning?  What are its&#13;
contributions (value added) to the organization? Who are the&#13;
primary users/audience of the planning process?&#13;
2. What planning approach is adopted to achieve these purposes?&#13;
3. What mechanisms, concepts, modalities and means are used to&#13;
implement the adopted approach:&#13;
(a) Do you distinguish among strategic planning, long-range and&#13;
operations planning and where does the organizational&#13;
responsibility lie for each?&#13;
(b) What is the time cycle and steps involved in the planning&#13;
process?&#13;
(c) What are the means of communicating and documenting plans&#13;
and coordinating the strategic planning, long-range&#13;
planning, and operations planning elements?&#13;
4. How was formalized planning introduced into the organization and&#13;
how did it evolve? What factors have influenced its evolution&#13;
and effectiveness (contributing, hindering)?&#13;
5. What common pitfalls should be avoided in planning practices?&#13;
How to maintain a high pay off for organizational planning?&#13;
Figure 1 suggests some of the key dimensions which the Bank&#13;
shares with the categories of organizations surveyed. We have found that&#13;
these dimension have significant impact on the planning environment and on&#13;
the scope and focus of the planning process. The following Figures and&#13;
Tables define these dimensions.&#13;

Figure 2 suggests some of the linkages between the&#13;
characteristics of the organization and its business and the environment&#13;
and their implications for the scope and focus of the planning function and&#13;
hence the basic approach to planning used. Table 2 suggests the major&#13;
impact of various business characteristics on the role of (need for) the&#13;
planning function. Table 3 highlights some of these characteristics and&#13;
their relevance to the Bank. The following points describe the impact of&#13;
key business and organizational characteristics on the planning process:&#13;
Impact of Business and Organizational Characteristics on Planning Processes&#13;
. When managers operate under consensus and/or entrepreneurial&#13;
approaches, a centrally-imposed planning process will be resisted&#13;
and resented.&#13;
. When organizations have no supportive culture for strategic&#13;
thinking, planners must create effective demand for their&#13;
services and demonstrate "value added" early on in introducing&#13;
planning tools and processes.&#13;
, An organization's position in the market can affect its role and&#13;
approach to planning - e.g. leadership means orienting planning&#13;
to influence the market rather than only adapt to it.&#13;
, Professional service organizations typically generate new ideas&#13;
and strategic direction based on a combination of what their&#13;
staff and managers are good at and what clients appear to need.&#13;
. The organization's "basis for success" must be an integral part&#13;
of the planning process: (1) in providing feedback on past&#13;
decisions; (2) in comparing strategic alternatives.&#13;
. Bottomrup planning probably won't work in a bureaucratic or&#13;
rigidly hierarchical organization.&#13;
. Where there is a high risk of error with major consequences, the&#13;
planning approach should incorporate contingency and "hedging"&#13;
devices, take an adaptive role, and be willing to detect and&#13;
acknowledge deviations early on.&#13;
. A stable customer base (usually associated with hard products and&#13;
repetitive services) permits the planning process to rely on the&#13;
market place for jpredicting future trends in sales volumes and&#13;
customer preferences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
&#149; Lead-time characteristics of organizations dictate:  (1) the&#13;
planning horizon; (2) the type of market information that is&#13;
needed for strategic business decisions; (3) the reliability of&#13;
projection of future markets and competitive conditions.&#13;
&#149; Where feedback on performance and the results of past strategic&#13;
decisions is unclear or slow, the planning process is usually&#13;
bureaucratic and budget driven. In such cases, planners may use&#13;
"performance indicators" as surrogates for measuring the actual&#13;
criteria for success.&#13;
&#149; Emphasis on performance measurement enhances the potential for&#13;
successfully introducing planning in an organization because it&#13;
heightens managers' sense of accountability.&#13;
Highly volatile and uncertain conditions of supply and demand may&#13;
mean it's best to use strategic planning to influence "position"&#13;
in the market.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This paper reviews the recent experience
            of strategic planning and management in large institutions,
            primarily in the private sector. The main conclusions are:
            (a) planing practices have undergone fundamental
            transformation in response to accelerated changes in the
            complexity of institutions, the diversity of their business,
            and the uncertainty and competitiveness of their
            environment; (b) planning has evolved towards increasing
            emphasis on understanding the external environment and
            competitors, providing a strategic framework for resource
            allocation, and integrating the strategies, structures,
            systems, skills and values of an institution to fulfill a
            clearly defined mission; (c) strategic planning practices
            have employed various tools to promote environmental
            analysis, differentiate among market segments, and formulate
            a hierarchy of atrategies for corporate, business and
            functional levels; and (d) strategic management has emerged
            as the latest form of planning in response to tendencies
            towards bureaucratization and centralization of the
            strategic planning function.
