            Telecom subsidies : output-based contracts
            for rural services in Peru
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In Peru private telecommunications
            operators bid for the minimum government subsidy to provide
            pay phone service to the poor in targeted rural areas. Part
            of the subsidy is paid on award, part once the equipment is
            installed, and the rest in semiannual installments for
            several years, contingent on compliance with performance
            standards. The winning bidders get a nonexclusive concession
            defining their rights and obligations. Early pilot results
            show that the private investment mobilized is twice the
            subsidy provided.
