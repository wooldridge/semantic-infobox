            Critics of the aid industry have accused
            it of acting like a cartel (Easterly 2002). The accusation
            has some bite-globally the industry remains somewhat
            concentrated, and for the typical recipient country, highly
            concentrated. Yet the most striking fact about the industry
            is how relentlessly competitive pressures are building.
            There has been a constant stream of new entrants, a steady
            fall in global and local concentration, and a clear tendency
            for donors to break out of historical patterns of aid and
            compete with one another. Could greater competition improve
            the efficiency of the aid system?
