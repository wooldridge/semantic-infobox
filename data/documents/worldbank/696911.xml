SECTION A: PROJECT DESCFIPTION&#13;
I. COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
A.   The Economy.&#13;
I .    Ghana, a country of about 16 million people, is well endowed with natural resources.&#13;
The economy has traditionally depended on primary production and exports of cocoa and&#13;
minerals. Agricultural production, primarily rain fed and small scale, is concentrated on staple&#13;
food crops and cocoa. Ghana ranks among the world's largest producers and exporters of&#13;
cocoa. About 60 percent of the Ghanaian labor force is employed in agriculture which&#13;
accounts for about 45 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The service sector, consisting&#13;
largely of trade and public sector services, is the second largest employer, accounting for over&#13;
25 percent of the labor force and about 40 percent of real GDP. The industrial sector accounts&#13;
for about 16 percent of GDP and employment; it is relatively diverse and well developed by&#13;
Sub-Saharan African standards.&#13;
2.    Compared to other West African countries, Ghana once enjoyed a relatively high&#13;
standard of living, but poor economic management during the 1970s and the early 1980s led to&#13;
a prolonged economic downturn. Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, high inflation,&#13;
and an overvalued nominal exchange rate, caused a substantial real appreciation of the&#13;
currency, leading to external payments imbalance. To mitigate the situation, policymakers&#13;
imposed a wide range of administrative controls on prices, imports, foreign exchange use and&#13;
the distribution of goods and services. This policy mix contributed to a downward economic&#13;
spiral from 1970 to 1982.&#13;
3.    After a devastating economic performance throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, the&#13;
Government introduced an Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in 1983 in order to: (a) restore&#13;
and sustain macroeconomic stability; (b) improve the efficiency of public sector resource&#13;
management; and (c) create an incentive framework to enhance efficiency, encourage savings&#13;
and investment, and provide an enabling environment for private sector development.&#13;
4.    The Government has been implementing a program of wide-ranging financial reforms.&#13;
It has abolished interest rate controls and sectoral credit ceilings, improved the legal framework&#13;
governing banking activities, and introduced uniform accounting and auditing standards for all&#13;
banks. The central bank is strengthening the supervision of banks. A program to restructure&#13;
the finances and management of distressed banks has been completed. The country has&#13;
established a small stock exchange, which is expected to be a vehicle for floating shares of&#13;
public enterprises to be divested.&#13;
5.    Ghana has a market-determined exchange rate system and a relatively low-tariff trade&#13;
regime, free of quantitative restrictions. In April 1990, the Government introduced an&#13;
interbank market supported by a weekly wholesale auction of foreign exchange, with a view to&#13;
encouraging such transactions among banks. More than half the foreign exchange in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
interbank market is supplied by the Central Bank. Foreign exchange transactions at exchange&#13;
bureaus were also legalized in 1990. The spread between the interbank exchange market and&#13;
the bureaus has continued to fall, and is currently less than 10 percent. The Government&#13;
abolished the import licensing system in 1989. Tariffs on imports have been reduced&#13;
substantially, and excise taxes on imports have been set at par with locally produced goods.&#13;
Export taxes, except that on cocoa, have been abolished. Tariff and pricing policy in the power&#13;
and energy sectors has also been improved.&#13;
6.    The Government has succeeded in mobilizing greater public revenues through tax&#13;
reform, improved tax collections, and rationalization of consumption taxes and user charges.&#13;
Public investment has grown from negligible levels at the beginning of the ERP to about 9&#13;
percent of GDP in 1993, and the focus has changed from direct investment in productive&#13;
activities to rehabilitation of economic and social infrastructure, especially roads and human&#13;
resources development. To better rationalize the public investment program, the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MOF) has established a committee, with representatives from sector ministries, which&#13;
coordinates investments and policies across sectors.&#13;
B. Current Macroeconomic Environment.&#13;
7.    Since the election-related fiscal shock of 1992, Ghana's macroeconomic situation has&#13;
remained fragile. After a number of years of strong macroeconomic performance, there was a&#13;
marked reversal in fiscal performance during the run-up to the 1992 elections when large wage&#13;
awards were granted to civil service and other public sector employees. In addition, delays in&#13;
passing increases in imported oil costs to consumers gave rise to large revenue losses. As a&#13;
result, the overall budget balance reverted from a surplus position of 1.5 percent of GDP in&#13;
1991 to a deficit of 4.8 percent in 1992 and the growth in money supply increased rapidly.&#13;
8.    There has been a remarkable turnaround in the fiscal balance from a deficit of 4.8&#13;
percent of GDP in 1992 to one of 0.8 percent in 1994. If divestiture receipts are included, the&#13;
fiscal balance was in surplus of 2.2 percent in 1994. However, in 1994 the Bank of Ghana&#13;
(BOG) was again unable to curtail monetary growth because of unplanned borrowing by the&#13;
parastatal Ghana National Petroleum Company to cover losses on oil trading and other&#13;
activities. Despite stepped-up open market operations, money supply grew by 46 percent in&#13;
1994, most of it in the last quarter. With GDP growth lower than expected due to untimely&#13;
rains, inflationary pressures intensified and the average inflation rate for the first seven months&#13;
of 1995 reached 40 percent.&#13;
9.    Ghana's external position, after deteriorating in 1992-93, improved substantially in&#13;
1994. The external current account deficit rose from 3.6 percent of GDP in 1991 to 9.2 percent&#13;
of GDP in 1993. From around mid-1993 onward, BOG limited its intervention in the foreign&#13;
exchange market, thereby allowing a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate. This policy, in&#13;
conjunction with the strengthening of the fiscal situation and strong export performance,&#13;
contributed to a reduction in the current account deficit in 1994 to 4.9 percent of GDP. Ghana&#13;
experienced a shortfall of US$200 million (or nearly 4 percent of GDP) in long-term&#13;
concessional aid in 1994, but the impact on the overall balance of payments was mitigated by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
receipts from the divestiture program and short-term external borrowing by the Cocoa Board.&#13;
Consequently, Ghana's foreign exchange reserves position improved to over four months of&#13;
imports by the end of 1994, compared with only three months at the end of 1993.&#13;
10.   The 1995 macroeconomic program, aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability, is&#13;
supported by a three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility approved by the IMF Board&#13;
on June 30, 1995. Implementation of the macroeconomic program is on track. Available data&#13;
show that Ghana overperformed in the first quarter of 1995. Net domestic financing of the&#13;
Government budget was below the IMF's program estimate by 1 percent of GDP. Net foreign&#13;
assets of the Central Bank were better than programmed, and broad money growth was lower&#13;
than targeted. Nevertheless, price increases intensified in 1995, largely reflecting the strong&#13;
monetary expansion in the last quarter of 1994 and the one-off revenue measures involving&#13;
increases in petrol and indirect taxes. Thus, for the 12-month period ending May 1995, the&#13;
consumer price index rose by 50 percent, compared to 34 percent at the end of 1994. However,&#13;
inflation is expected to abate if the program remains on track for the remainder of 1995.&#13;
11.   At the core of the 1995 macroeconomic program--as agreed under the Policy&#13;
Framework Paper (PFP) 1995-97--are measures designed to secure a fiscal surplus of 1.2&#13;
percent of GDP and a money supply growth of 14 percent. Real GDP is projected to grow at 5&#13;
percent. Sales tax (including on services), removal of exempted zero-rated tax status for&#13;
imports, increases in petroleum tax, and re-imposition of withholding tax on interest earnings&#13;
are among the revenue measures. Wage increases have been restrained to 35 percent in 1995.&#13;
Notwithstanding an outbreak of civil disturbances in mid-May 1995, which led to the&#13;
withdrawal of the value added tax, the original PFP fiscal targets are expected to be met.&#13;
C. Financial Sector.&#13;
12.   Comparative financial indicators confirm that Ghana's financial system is not very&#13;
deep. Broad money holdings (M2) are equivalent to about 17 percent of GDP, as compared&#13;
with 79 percent in Malaysia, 46 percent in Indonesia, 37 percent in Kenya, and 30 percent in&#13;
Zimbabwe. Reflecting their mistrust of banks, Ghanaians keep nearly half of their total money&#13;
in currency rather than in bank deposits, as compared to about 10 percent in Indonesia,&#13;
Thailand, and Malaysia, and 20 percent in Kenya, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Currency holdings&#13;
outside of banks are also large relative to total monetary aggregates. The table below shows&#13;
that the currency intensity of the economy (C/M2) recorded a steady rise, instead of decline,&#13;
from 28 percent to 38 percent over the past 5 years. In Ghana, not only is the ratio high but the&#13;
rate of growth of currency in circulation is explosive--four times in the past four years.&#13;

Inflation&#13;

13.   A number of factors have contributed to the low level of participation in the formal&#13;
financial system. Confidence was undermined when the confidentiality of bank accounts was&#13;
violated in the early 1980s and later bank-portfolios underwent large scale restructuring. In&#13;
addition, during the 1970s and 1980s, inflation drove individuals to shift their financial assets&#13;
into real form to avoid losing the value of their resources. Until recently, low or negative real&#13;
deposit rates and high transaction costs offered few incentives for holding wealth in banks or&#13;
otherwise dealing with the formal financial system.&#13;
14.   Low confidence in the financial system has contributed to Ghana's low recorded&#13;
savings and investment rates. In fact, gross national savings never rose above 15 percent of&#13;
GDP. After falling to under 5 percent in 1983, the savings rate recovered but remained below&#13;
10 percent. This level compares quite unfavorably with East Asian countries where savings&#13;
rates of 30 percent are common. Similarly, recorded investment rates are far below levels&#13;
required to push Ghana into an accelerated growth mode. However, evidence from household&#13;
surveys suggests that actual savings are much higher than records show, but that most are kept&#13;
in such nonfinancial forms as inventories or building materials, which are generally not&#13;
captured in Ghana's national accounts statistics. It is clear that individuals are reluctant to save&#13;
with formal financial institutions, which hinders effective financial intermediation and&#13;
depresses the rate of return on capital.&#13;
15.   Meanwhile, almost all the savings entering the formal financial system have served to&#13;
satisfy the public sector borrowing requirement, with less than a third of outstanding credit&#13;
going to the private sector. The incentives created by macroeconomic policy have thus&#13;
maximized the banks' role as financiers of the government and minimized their role as&#13;
financiers of the private sector. In view of the credit demand generated by an accelerated pace&#13;
of divestiture of public enterprises and stronger private sector growth, it is imperative for the&#13;
government to shift to a fiscal surplus over the next several years. As this happens, the stock of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
government debt will fall and the financial system will play a much larger role in investment&#13;
finance, thereby further strengthening confidence in the financial system.&#13;
D. Financial Sector Reform.&#13;
16.   Under the ERP, the government began implementing a program of wide-ranging&#13;
financial reforms. It abolished interest rate controls and sectoral credit ceilings. By&#13;
introducing a weekly auction of treasury bills, it began to lay the foundation for a system of&#13;
indirect monetary control. Under the first Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FINSAC I),&#13;
prudential regulations were strengthened and actions taken to improve bank supervision.&#13;
Seven banks were restructured, with some non-performing assets transferred to a newly created&#13;
government agency, the Non-Performing Assets Recovery Trust. Banks were allowed to set&#13;
lending and deposit rates freely, and the new banking law guaranteed client confidentiality.&#13;
17.  In 1989, seeking to improve the country's regulatory and supervisory framework, Ghana&#13;
enacted a new banking law. Specifically, this law defined capital adequacy and minimum&#13;
capital requirements, prudential lending guidelines, and financial reporting procedures;&#13;
imposed sufficient and explicit safeguards against, and penalties for, excessive risk taking; and,&#13;
standardized and broadened requirements, which are now far more rigorous. Together, these&#13;
provisions have improved the ability of regulatory authorities to monitor the financial condition&#13;
of banks.&#13;
18.  In addition to the enactment of the new banking law, banking sector reform introduced&#13;
the following new features: the upgrading of BOG's examination and supervision functions&#13;
and introduction of a new, comprehensive system of returns; improvements in bank&#13;
examination skills through twinning arrangements and specialized training; introduction of&#13;
annual examinations; standardization of accounting practices guided a Manual ofAccounting&#13;
for banks, prepared by BOG; and removal of no explicit entry and exit restrictions in the&#13;
banking sector. Under the Private Enterprise and Export Development (PEED) Project&#13;
Ghana's international payments system, its links to the global Society for Worldwide Interbank&#13;
Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) system, but left the domestic payments system to be&#13;
addressed in the future.&#13;
19.   Under the ongoing FINSAC 11, the focus has been on reducing policy distortions in the&#13;
financial system by encouraging positive real interest rates. Competition in the banking system&#13;
is to be increased through the divestiture of public sector shareholdings in banks. To improve&#13;
the legal and regulatory framework applicable to non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), a new&#13;
Non-Bank Financial Institutions Act has been introduced, although this subsector has so far&#13;
played a relatively small role in the financial system as a whole.&#13;
20.   Despite these financial reforms, further actions are needed to strengthen confidence in&#13;
the sector--and therefore increase the level of savings and intermediation by formal financial&#13;
institutions. Regulation and supervision must be strengthened to build public confidence in the&#13;
financial system and to become an effective intermediary and promote investments in the&#13;
private sector rather than the purchase of government paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
E. Rural and Informal Finance.&#13;
21.   Rural financial markets in Ghana consist of formal institutions, such as branches of&#13;
commercial banks and rural banks, and informal institutions, such as susu collectors (informal&#13;
deposit takers). Both play an important role in intermediating between savers and investors.&#13;
Thus far, Ghana's rural financial institutions have not been able to provide people in the&#13;
countryside with adequate access to savings or credit, particularly in the agricultural sector.&#13;
The Rural Finance Project, which has closed recently, addressed some of the issues related to&#13;
rural finance institutions. The project contributed to financial restructuring of rural financial&#13;
institutions, including privately owned rural banks and credit unions, by enabling them to&#13;
mobilize more deposits and increase the flow of credit to the dominant sector of the economy.&#13;
The ongoing Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Project is addressing some issues related to&#13;
the financing needs of small and medium enterprises.&#13;
F. Divestiture.&#13;
22.   Recently there has been positive change in the Government's attitude towards the&#13;
private sector. The policy environment for the private sector has improved. The public-private&#13;
sector dialogue initiated in 1991 has been broadened and strengthened through the Private&#13;
Sector Roundtable and the Private Enterprise Foundation. Changes in policies include the&#13;
Statutory Corporations Act under which public corporations are converted into companies with&#13;
salable shares and a new, more liberal Investment Act that was approved in November 1994.&#13;
23.   After many years of hesitation, Ghana's privatization program has begun to pick up&#13;
steam. The sale of Ashanti Goldfields Corporation (AGC) marked an important threshold in&#13;
generating broad-based support for privatization and in signaling the Government's support for&#13;
the private sector. The subsequent sale of the Government's minority holdings --to&#13;
international fund managers--in seven companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange has&#13;
reinforced that support. The Divestiture Implementation Committee (DIC) has recently sold&#13;
ten more State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) to the private sector. New and more transparent&#13;
procedures for divestiture, including the subcontracting of the implementation of divestiture to&#13;
private firms, have been approved by the Cabinet. The divestiture of three commercial banks&#13;
now being implemented by international financial advisors will strengthen the process. The&#13;
recent decision to seek private participation in the telecommunication sector is expected to&#13;
mark another important threshold. The Government has also announced its decision to open&#13;
the power sector to private participation. It is important now to sustain these positive signals&#13;
and ensure that the lingering doubts of the past on private sector development do not reappear.&#13;
G. Private Sector Development.&#13;
24.   As a part of the ongoing commitment to strengthening and deepening the nascent&#13;
private sector, two projects are being implemented. The first, PEED, in cooperation with&#13;
United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Trade and Investment&#13;
Program, is supporting the general area of export finance and its attendant needs. The second&#13;
project, the Private Sector Development (PSD) Credit, is aimed at strengthening the technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
capacity of both public sector research and development as well as the private sector itself. In&#13;
addition, technical assistance is being provided to strengthen the institutional capacity of the&#13;
commercial judicial system.&#13;
II. THE REMAINING AGENDA&#13;
A. Current Problems.&#13;
25.   Ghana has achieved significant economic progress in the last ten years as a result of the&#13;
broad-based adjustment strategy adopted under the ERP. However, there is concern that the&#13;
economy has not yet been able to generate higher growth. This is, in part, due to the fact that&#13;
Ghana has not yet achieved much success in the mobilization and allocation of domestic and&#13;
foreign capital, which are key factors in stimulating private sector-led growth.&#13;
26.   Firstly, on the domestic front, both gross domestic savings (GDS) and gross domestic&#13;
investment (GDI) as proportions of GDP have fallen below 10 percent since 1980, much lower&#13;
than in the developing countries in Asia. However, household survey data show that&#13;
significant amounts of household savings (about 10 percent to 15 percent of GDP) are held in&#13;
the form of non-financial assets, which results in an inefficient use of scarce savings. Also, the&#13;
formal financial sector has been unable to mobilize adequate amounts of equity and medium -&#13;
to -long term financing. The recently completed Ghana Financial Sector Report (Report&#13;
Number GH-1 3423, dated December 29, 1994) concludes that one factor that has contributed&#13;
significantly to the low formal savings and investment rates ispoorfinancial intermediation in&#13;
the economy. Ghana also lacks an efficient domestic payments system necessary to provide&#13;
fast and convenient transactions to the entire financial system. Despite improvements in the&#13;
banking industry, the creation of effective institutions to intermediate financial flows between&#13;
domestic savers and investors has been hampered by the weakness of NBFI. These NBFI often&#13;
play very important roles in increasing the mobilization of savings, particularly the term&#13;
savings necessary to promote equity and term financing. Since Ghana has been achieving&#13;
significant progress under the broad macroeconomic and banking sector reform programs, it is&#13;
now necessary for it to turn its attention to the development of a competitive, efficient and well&#13;
supervised non-bank financial sector to improve the mobilization of domestic capital, which in&#13;
turn would encourage increased savings mobilization from the formal and informal sectors.&#13;
27.   Secondly, in an era where it is increasingly desirable for declining official flows to be&#13;
replaced by private flows, the economy has begun to attract interest from both direct and&#13;
portfolio foreign investors and from the large number of Ghanaian residents abroad. This is&#13;
evident from the success of the local and foreign portions of Ashanti Goldfields Corporation&#13;
(AGC) share issues and the sale of GOG minority holdings to foreign portfolio investors. Yet,&#13;
Ghana lacks the well developed institutional infrastructure necessary to take advantage of these&#13;
developments to build true "emerging market" status for its economy. Ghana must now seek to&#13;
develop the institutions, instruments and incentives necessary to attract sustainableforeign&#13;
private investmentflows into its economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
28.   The Ghana Financial Sector Report concluded that effective financial&#13;
intermediation will require: (a) the promotion of greater competition and more&#13;
innovation in the sector (involving divestiture and well supervised entry and exit); (b) the&#13;
strengthening of the financial and legal infrastructure (including human resource&#13;
development, better payments system, especially cash management, and improved&#13;
information on enforcement of contracts); and (c) the integration of the formal and&#13;
informal financial sectors. While previous IDA operations have gone a long way in&#13;
addressing problems in the banking sector, improving their financial infrastructure, and&#13;
promoting competition in the banking industry, issues related to the non-bank financial&#13;
sector have not been explicitly addressed until now.&#13;
29.   In the Ghanaian payment system, check clearance and settlement is still slow and&#13;
manual. Checks are not standardized. Risks are insufficiently covered because there are gaps&#13;
in the legal infrastructure governing payments, clearing and settlement. There are&#13;
inefficiencies in the flow of Government funds due to inadequate information flows. The&#13;
technological infrastructure needed for modem money and securities markets needs to be put in&#13;
place, and skills enhanced for that purpose. Modernization of the domestic payments system&#13;
would lead to improvements in the efficiency of financial transactions, monetary management&#13;
and the receipt and disbursal of public finances. The first step would be a review of possible&#13;
alternative designs for the payments system incorporating the needs of all major users, such as&#13;
the financial institutions (commercial banks, securities institutions, etc.), BOG, and&#13;
Government Agencies such as the Customs, Excise and Prevention Service (CEPS) and the&#13;
Internal Revenue Service (IRS).&#13;
B. The Non-Bank Financial Sector.&#13;
30.   Currently, the non-bank financial sector in Ghana is small, contributing only about 24&#13;
percent of the total financial assets in the country, with 11 percent in the government-owned&#13;
Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) and 4 percent on the stock exchange. As&#13;
a comparison, in South Korea, NBFI accounted for 61 percent of total financial assets in 1992,&#13;
up from 49 percent in 1987. Though the non-bank financial sector is diverse, apart from&#13;
SSNIT, the other NBFI are small and do not appear to be developing as expected. The Ghana&#13;
Stock Exchange (GSE) has only 18 companies listed, but is expected to benefit from the&#13;
excellent response to the recent privatization of AGC and seven other companies in which&#13;
GOG has minority interests. There are sixteen insurance companies but the industry is&#13;
dominated by two state-owned firms. Other NBFI include five recently established merchant&#13;
banks, the Home Finance Company (HFC), building societies, one unit trust, one venture&#13;
capital company, two discount houses, and three leasing companies. Except for SSNIT and&#13;
HFC (which follow commercial management practices) and two major insurance sector&#13;
institutions, other NBFI are privately owned. With appropriate technical support, these NBFI&#13;
could be strengthened to make financial intermediation more effective so that this sector can&#13;
realize its potential for mobilizing and investing the capital required to generate higher growth&#13;
in the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
31.   The non-bank financial sector faces many of the same obstacles as the formal banking&#13;
sector. State dominance and a poor regulatory environment have limited the role of private&#13;
NBFI, which in turn has inhibited the development of new financial instruments that could&#13;
allow portfolio managers to hedge risks in an unstable macroeconomic environment.&#13;
Macroeconomic instability and lack of confidence in the formal financial system have also&#13;
limited their ability to mobilize savings. As a result, NBFI have been largely unable to provide&#13;
equity and long-term finance to the private sector.&#13;
32.   In many countries, savers use contractual savings institutions (life insurance companies,&#13;
occupational pension schemes, national provident funds, and funded social security systems)&#13;
and collective savings institutions (mutual funds and unit trusts) to diversify risks. Because of&#13;
their size, the portfolios of these institutions are typically managed by specialists. Small savers&#13;
thus benefit from the expertise provided by fund managers and often achieve returns on their&#13;
savings in excess of commercial bank deposit rates. Because of their long term and generally&#13;
predictable liability structure, contractual savings institutions can also be a good source of&#13;
long-term financing for private investment. Most countries which have diversified financial&#13;
sectors, private sector corporations raise funds through the issuance of corporate bonds and&#13;
shares which are supported by contractual savings institutions. In Ghana, however, contractual&#13;
savings institutions have not yet sufficiently developed to perform these functions effectively.&#13;
33.   GOG is concerned about the inadequacy of financial services available to consumers,&#13;
both individual and small and micro enterprises, both in urban and rural areas. It would,&#13;
therefore, like to review alternatives for expanding financial intermediation in informal, rural&#13;
and small sectors, including informal and formal institutions, banks and non-bank institutions.&#13;
C. The Institutional Framework.&#13;
34.   With the exception of pension funds, capital market institutions, HFC and insurance&#13;
companies, the operations of NBFI are governed by Ghana's NBFI Law, 1993. Enacted as part&#13;
of the financial sector reform, this law provides an adequate framework for diversifying the&#13;
financial system and creating competition for banks. It confers on BOG the power to license&#13;
and regulate the nine specific categories of NBFI such as, leasing companies, mortgage&#13;
financing companies, savings and loans, finance houses, credit unions, discount houses,&#13;
acceptance houses, venture capital funding companies and building societies.&#13;
35.   Under the NBFI Law, BOG also has executive powers to issue subsidiary legislation&#13;
and rules to regulate the operations of NBFI in general, or of a particular category of NBFI as&#13;
listed in the Law. BOG has therefore drafted a set of regulations to flesh out some of the&#13;
general provisions of the 1993 Law. Key features of the proposed regulations include:&#13;
(a)   A standardized set of explicit and transparent terms and conditions of licensing&#13;
covering all requirements mentioned generally under the NBFI Law. The&#13;
licensing terms allow BOG the right to conduct on-site inspections, which was&#13;
not stated explicitly in the NBFI Law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
(b)   While the 1993 Law sets the minimum capital at ¢ 100 million, BOG's&#13;
operating guidelines reduced the minimum capital requirements to C 20-50&#13;
million for savings and loan companies, and C 5-10 million for credit unions,&#13;
depending on the size of total deposits. This reduction in minimum capital&#13;
requirements was welcomed because it eases entry into the NBFI sector at the&#13;
early stage of its development and encourages competition.&#13;
(c)    To establish the distinction between banks and non-banks, BOG proposes that,&#13;
in accordance with the Law, only banks will accept demand deposits and offer&#13;
checking facilities, and that NBFI impose a minimum period of deposit of three&#13;
months unless prior exemption is obtained from BOG.&#13;
(d)   NBFI must put transfers from net profits into a reserve fund and maintain&#13;
mandatory levels of funding identical to that required of banks. This prudential&#13;
requirement contributes to the financial safety and soundness of NBFI.&#13;
(e)    NBFI must follow the same procedures for loan-loss provisioning and the&#13;
recognition of interest as income on non-performing loans as banks. This&#13;
assures soundness without giving either banks or NBFI unfair advantages.&#13;
(f)    BOG suggests a basis for computing risk assets identical to that prescribed&#13;
under the Banking Act, and requires a capital adequacy ratio of at least 10&#13;
percent. The capital adequacy ratio of 10 percent, however, is higher than the 6&#13;
percent capital adequacy ratio required of banks.&#13;
36.   The proposed regulations leave the legal status of non-bank financial enterprises that&#13;
fall below the minimum capital requirements unclear. It is, however, not in the interest of the&#13;
authorities to regulate and supervise small scale financial activities below a certain threshold.&#13;
At the same time, the authorities recognize that these activities are an integral part of the&#13;
informal financial system, as will be discussed in subsequent chapters. It is the government's&#13;
position to encourage informal operators to join the formal system by supporting their efforts to&#13;
build up their businesses in order to qualify for registration under the Law.&#13;
37.   Other legislation covers specific types of transactions undertaken by NBFI. For&#13;
example, the 1993 Finance Lease Law lays down a procedure for executing financial leases and&#13;
establishes explicit rights and obligations of the lessor and lessee. By providing adequate&#13;
protection to the lessor, the law promotes leasing activity in Ghana. A key feature of this law&#13;
is the mandatory registration of lease agreements with an authority designated by BOG. At&#13;
present, all finance leases have to be registered in the Deeds Registry under the control of the&#13;
Registrar General, so that the lessor's prior claim on the leased asset is properly recorded and&#13;
publicized. The Securities Industry Law, 1993, has been recently revised, but the Insurance&#13;
Law, 1989, and the Reinsurance Law, 1990, will be reviewed under this Project. Thus, the&#13;
next steps is to build on the initiatives outlined above in order to strengthen and revitalize the&#13;
institutions and the infrastructures in the non-bank financial sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
III. PROJECT DESIGN&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Approach.&#13;
38.   The proposed credit has two objectives. The first objective is to promote the growth of&#13;
an efficient, competitive, well regulated, non-bank financial sector and an efficient payments&#13;
system in order to: (a) increase the mobilization of domestic savings in both formal and&#13;
informal sectors; (b) facilitate the flow of international capital into Ghana through better&#13;
financial intermediation; and (c) supply financial services competitively to the economy. The&#13;
second objective is to create an environment conducive to greater private sector activity and&#13;
support the successful implementation of the divestiture program for SOE and the three largest&#13;
state-owned commercial banks.&#13;
39.   The project seeks to strengthen institutions and introduce instruments which would&#13;
create conditions to encourage substantial amounts of savings held in informal, non-financial&#13;
assets to move to the formal financial sector where they can be used more productively.&#13;
Different institutions in the non-bank financial sector are at different stages of development and&#13;
specific interventions have been designed in each sub-sector to support the institutions,&#13;
instruments and incentives required to: (a) create sound legislative and regulatory frameworks&#13;
for each sub-sector; (b) develop appropriate organization structures; (c) achieve improvements&#13;
in operational efficiency; (d) increase competition and support divestiture where necessary; (e)&#13;
build local capacity; (f) develop instruments necessary for increased savings mobilization to&#13;
ensure efficient and secure financial intermediation; and (g) promote institutions and&#13;
instruments to improve the provision of financial services to the informal and rural sectors so&#13;
that institutions in these sectors can be strengthened and become part of the formal financial&#13;
sector.&#13;
40.   The project design is summarized in Table 2, which shows the technical assistance&#13;
planned. Specifically, for each beneficiary, the project would support one or more of the&#13;
following: (a) legislative reforms; (b) regulatory reforms and strengthening of regulatory&#13;
capacity; (c) organization structuring; (d) institution building; (e) building local capacity&#13;
through technical, managerial and market development training; (f) greater competition and&#13;
divestiture of GOG shareholding; and (g) market and product development.&#13;
41.   Project design builds on the findings of the Ghana Financial Sector Report and ongoing&#13;
financial sector work under other projects, such as FINSAC II, PEED, the Private Sector&#13;
Adjustment Credit (PSAC), etc. A summary of these linkages is provided in Table 3.&#13;

B. Relation with Other Multilateral Assistance.&#13;
42.   The Bank plays an important role in improving the regulatory environment and building&#13;
local capacity through technical assistance, which in turn creates an appropriate environment&#13;
for the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and other private investors to take equity or&#13;
debt positions in NBFI. IFC will be particularly involved in the reform of insurance industry to&#13;
ensure that the emerging structure is conducive to attracting international private capital.&#13;
C. Project Risks.&#13;
43.   This is a low risk project. There are two main risks associated with the project, one&#13;
exogenous and one endogenous. The exogenous risk is that if GOG allows any laxity in fiscal&#13;
and monetary policies, it could lead to further currency depreciation and increased inflationary&#13;
pressure. Moreover, the current high interest rate levels on BOG Treasury Bills undermine&#13;
NBFI incentives to intermediate and lend to the private sector. The Government, however, has&#13;
recently tightened its fiscal and monetary policies in line with the understandings with the&#13;
Bank and IMF to address this issue, and ongoing parallel dialogue is expected to lead to&#13;
increased price stability and, thus, to a lower interest rate structure.&#13;
44.   The endogenous risk is that reform of three or four sub-sectors simultaneously might&#13;
stretch the absorptive capacity at the industry and ministry levels, and at the level of some&#13;
specific beneficiaries. At the industry and ministry level, this risk is being addressed through a&#13;
decentralized implementation arrangement, with adequate independence and autonomy for&#13;
each beneficiary, supported by assistance from the Project Coordination and Implementation&#13;
Team (PCT) supervised by an expert on NBFI. This project advisor, supported by a consultant&#13;
familiar with the Bank's procurement and disbursement procedures, would assist individual&#13;
beneficiaries in procurement, disbursement, accounts and audits, and other reporting&#13;
requirements. The fact that each beneficiary was successfully able to formulate the Terms of&#13;
Reference (TOR) for each component, with assistance from the project team, is an indicator&#13;
that the beneficiaries have adequate in-house capacity to undertake the reform effort. Also, the&#13;
mid-term review includes conditions that require timely implementation, thereby allowing for&#13;
corrective actions and minimizing the risk.&#13;
D. Project Benefits.&#13;
45.   This technical assistance project will strengthen the capacity of NBFI by enhancing the&#13;
human resource base of the institutions under the project, by improving the payments system&#13;
(including a nationwide cash management system) and by promoting greater competition&#13;
among NBFI through adequate supervision, privatization of insurance companies and entry of&#13;
new firms. This is expected to accelerate innovation in financial services, including increased&#13;
availability of term financing (equity and loans), which is currently a critical constraint to&#13;
private sector growth.&#13;
46.   Strengthening the financial infrastructure and increasing competition will help improve&#13;
domestic resource mobilization and make financial intermediation more effective, which in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
turn would make the allocation of investible resources more efficient. The Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) envisages numerous policies and programs that would decrease Ghana's&#13;
reliance on public savings and foreign aid as sources of investment financing in order to rely&#13;
increasingly on private domestic savings and foreign capital. CAS projections forecast&#13;
Ghana's dependence on aid to decline over the medium term--gross national savings are&#13;
projected to grow from 7 percent of GDP in 1994 to 15 percent in 2000 and GDI from 16&#13;
percent to around 20 percent of GDP during the same period. Most of the projected growth in&#13;
savings (private savings to rise from 2.5 percent to 10 percent of GDP) and investment would&#13;
originate in the private sector, provided adequate policies are in place.&#13;
47.   Even by sub-Saharan standards, Ghana's recorded savings and investment rates are&#13;
much lower than that of comparable developing countries, though micro level survey data&#13;
reveal that household savings rates are substantially higher. For reasons outlined earlier, savers&#13;
in Ghana tend to hold savings in the form of non-financial real assets, such as building&#13;
materials or inventories which are generally neither captured in the national accounts nor are&#13;
these savings available to contribute productively to sustained growth. The reluctance of&#13;
individuals to save within the formal financial sector hampers effective financial intermediation&#13;
and depresses growth because savings are not invested in activities with the highest rates of&#13;
return. Ghana's financial system is not deep. This is reflected by low broad money holdings&#13;
(M2) of about 17 percent of GDP compared to 79 percent in Malaysia, 37 percent in Kenya and&#13;
30 percent in Zimbabwe. Ghanaians also keep nearly half of their monetary assets in currency,&#13;
compared to currency-to-deposit ratios of 10 percent in Thailand and Malaysia, and about 20&#13;
percent in Kenya and Zimbabwe.&#13;
48.   This project will also indirectly contribute to poverty reduction, the central objective of&#13;
the Bank's program in Ghana. One-third of Ghana's population, or about five million people,&#13;
live below the poverty line. Three-fourths of the poor live in rural and semi-urban areas and it&#13;
is in these areas that access to financial services is the most difficult. Although Ghana's&#13;
informal financial sector is large, with an estimated 45 percent of all private sector financial&#13;
savings mobilized through informal channels, its capacity to intermediate between savers and&#13;
investors is limited in part by the poor linkages between the informal and the formal sectors.&#13;
This is because formal providers of financial services are concentrated geographically in a few&#13;
urban centers and because formal financial institutions discourage small and micro clients even&#13;
in areas where they are present. But the informal sector's capability to mobilize savings and its&#13;
information base are valuable assets which formal institutions would like to access if the&#13;
technology could be identified and demonstrated. There may be other opportunities for&#13;
profitable interlinkages between the informal and the formnal sectors, such as bringing savings&#13;
generated by susu collectors (informal deposit takers) into the formal sector or allowing traders&#13;
to access formal credit by simplifying the use of collateral. It is thus necessary to establish&#13;
institutions and introduce instruments that can most appropriately satisfy the savings and credit&#13;
needs of those segments of the population which are not currently serviced by the formal&#13;
financial sector, particularly the creation of the infrastructure to link rural and semi-urban areas&#13;
to urban areas and the informal financial sector to the formal sector. Improving access to&#13;
financial services is expected to generate new sources of livelihood for this segment of the&#13;
population and thus contribute to poverty reduction. To the extent that diagnostic work on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
small scale and informal finance (supported by the project) will lead to the implementation of&#13;
new mechanisms for mobilizing savings and providing credit to the poor and micro-enterprises,&#13;
the project will have contributed to reducing poverty more directly at a later date.&#13;
IV. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
49.   The project addresses identified gaps in the non-bank financial sector including Capital&#13;
Markets Institutions such as GSE, Securities Regulatory Commission (SRC), and BOG, and&#13;
the Contractual Savings Institutions such as National Insurance Commission (NIC), SIC,&#13;
Ghana Reinsurance Organization (GRO), and SSNIT. The project also provides for Associated&#13;
Financial Infrastructure (domestic payments system) and Capacity Building in the NBFI&#13;
sector for the School of Administration at the University of Ghana, Institute of Chartered&#13;
Accountants of Ghana (ICAG) and HFC, and Diagnostic Studies at MOF to enable GOG to&#13;
prepare strategies for future action in expanding the provision of financial services to rural and&#13;
informal sectors.&#13;
A. Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE).&#13;
50.   Created five years ago, GSE is a well managed institution. As illustrated by the&#13;
successful initial public offering of the shares of AGC and the sale of GOG's minority holding&#13;
in seven companies to foreign portfolio investors in 1994, GSE benefits from the interest of the&#13;
international investment community in emerging markets. However, because of the small&#13;
number of companies listed and the low volume of transactions, the exchange is still not self-&#13;
sustaining. An effective stock exchange would be critical for the successful implementation of&#13;
the accelerated divestiture program. To the extent that the companies to be privatized will have&#13;
shares traded publicly on the exchange, the privatization program should bring significant&#13;
additional volume to GSE and the industry. It should also help enhance the image of GSE&#13;
among the international investment community in order to attract foreign investments into the&#13;
country and build greater awareness about GSE among the investing public. However, GSE&#13;
would need to prepare itself to handle a larger number of transactions while at the same time&#13;
bringing its operations to internationally accepted standards, particularly in terms of settlement&#13;
time and number of failed deliveries.&#13;
51.   Since its creation, GSE has benefited from several technical assistance (TA) programs.&#13;
Under FINSAC 11, TA components included public education on the role of GSE, training of&#13;
staff and other market operators and the creation of a small fund of US$30,000 for use as&#13;
working capital credit to small and medium sized firms wishing to raise capital through the&#13;
stock exchange. It will benefit from the Long Term Debt Study currently underway as part of&#13;
the PEED. This NBFI Credit will build on the technical assistance already provided to GSE&#13;
through support for the following components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Institution Building.&#13;
Under this component, support will be provided for the following:&#13;
52.   Clearing and settlement of securities. Many market operators have identified the&#13;
absence of a modern, centralized clearing and settlement system as one of the major&#13;
weaknesses of GSE. The official settlement period is 14 days compared with the international&#13;
norm of 5 days or less, and yet the proportion of failed deliveries, i.e., deliveries not completed&#13;
within the 14 day settlement period, is high despite the low transaction volume. With the&#13;
anticipated increase in the volume of transactions, the risk of a major failure in the system&#13;
would also increase. An IFC financed study of a centralized clearing and settlement system&#13;
provides a blueprint for the system and identifies various options which may be pursued. The&#13;
clearing and settlement system would also cover government bonds and other fixed-income&#13;
securities. Technical assistance is now needed to select the option, complete the design,&#13;
procure the equipment, set up the appropriate procedures within GSE, and train staff. This&#13;
component would include a consultant for five months to identify the most cost effective&#13;
option and assist GSE in selecting the vendor and negotiating the acquisition of the system on a&#13;
turnkey basis. The cost of this component is US$1.425 million over a three-year period.&#13;
Appropriate coordination with BOG would also be maintained during the design and&#13;
implementation of this component to ensure full compatibility with the system proposed to be&#13;
installed for the modernization of the payments system.&#13;
53.   Improving Operational Efficiency. GSE lacks adequate computer and&#13;
telecommunications equipment to cope with an increase in the volume of transactions. It is&#13;
proposed that under this component support would be provided to GSE to procure computers,&#13;
office equipment and reference material. The cost of this component is US$0.2 million over a&#13;
three-year period.&#13;
54.   Issue and trading of equity securities and links with other stock exchanges in&#13;
Africa. GSE lacks the in-house skills required to give advice to its members, potential&#13;
investors, corporate issuers and the local banking community in areas such as the structuring of&#13;
new security issues, trading and settlement, securities law, security portfolio management and&#13;
new product development. Under this component an equity specialist would be hired to&#13;
strengthen the technical capacity of GSE and other market participants in these areas and assist&#13;
the stock exchange in implementing various components of this credit. To increase the supply&#13;
of securities in the capital markets, the equity specialist would assist GSE and its members in:&#13;
(a) identifying likely candidates for public placement among enterprises in the divestiture&#13;
program, recommending which of the three lists on GSE, if any, would be most appropriate or&#13;
whether an indirect mechanism such as the PT (discussed under MOF) should be used instead;&#13;
(b) structuring new equity issues; (c) upgrading rules, regulations and practices of GSE to&#13;
international standards; (d) reviewing options to establish links with the other stock markets in&#13;
the region, such as dual listing of stocks, issue of depository receipts and other forms of&#13;
cooperative arrangements; and (e) designing and implementing the educational and&#13;
promotional campaign planned by GSE to promote the role of the securities industry in the&#13;
development of the private sector. The equity specialist would participate in building the local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
implementation capacity by working in close cooperation with local counterparts at GSE. In&#13;
addition, to enhance local capacity building, specific efforts would be made to assign some of&#13;
the tasks defined in the TOR to one or more local consultants and specialists, whenever the&#13;
relevant skills are available in the country. The cost of this component is US$0.3 million for&#13;
24 man-months of consultant spread over a 36-month period.&#13;
Building Local Capacity.&#13;
55.   Under this component support will be provided for strengthening the GSE training&#13;
program. GSE organizes and offers several training programs on its premises, however, there&#13;
is a need to increase the training capacity of the exchange and ensure that the proposal to&#13;
strengthen existing training facilities at GSE is the most cost effective option. The cost of the&#13;
program, including development and production of training material, is US$0.5 million over a&#13;
three-year period. A special effort would be made to hire local consultants and specialists&#13;
whenever the appropriate skills exist in the country.&#13;
Market and Product Development.&#13;
56.   Distribution of Securities. This component would provide financing for: (a) the&#13;
educational campaign designed by the Equity Specialist (above) to increase the awareness and&#13;
understanding by the local population of the role of the securities market in the context of the&#13;
divestiture of public enterprises and the development of the private sector; (b) the training of&#13;
other financial institutions in the distribution of securities; and (c) the dissemination of&#13;
information on public offerings of shares to non-resident Ghanaians and foreign investors.&#13;
Agreement was reached on the outlines for the above programs to administered by GSE. The&#13;
cost of this component is US$0.7 million over a 36-month period, including US$0.3 million for&#13;
the cost of the educational campaign and US$0.4 million for the training of financial&#13;
institutions.&#13;
B. Securities Regulatory Commission (SRC).&#13;
57.   Although a Securities Regulatory Commission is provided for in the Securities Industry&#13;
Law 1993, it has not yet been established, and the Governor of BOG is exercising the functions&#13;
of the SRC temporarily. SRC has a very important role in the supervision and regulation of the&#13;
securities industry, including the screening, licensing and supervision of market operators; the&#13;
formulation of detailed regulations and code of conduct; and the surveillance of securities&#13;
trading with the objective of ensuring the integrity and transparency of the market and&#13;
protecting the interest of investors. Therefore, it is important to set up the SRC on a priority&#13;
basis and to appoint an independent Commissioner. This project will support the following&#13;
components to enable BOG and the Government to establish and operationalize SRC.&#13;
Strengthiening Regulatory Capacity and Organization Structuring.&#13;
58.   Under this component, a consultant would be appointed at SRC to prepare regulations&#13;
and procedures for the Commission with the legal advice of a Securities Lawyer (see below) to&#13;
propose an organizational structure, assist in selecting staff, and recommend specifications of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
computer and communications equipment. The cost of this component is US$0.1 million over&#13;
12 months. Legal support to the consultant would be provided by a lawyer specialized in&#13;
securities law ("the Securities Lawyer"). The Securities Lawyer would provide 12 man-&#13;
months of support on legal matters: (a) to the Consultant (above) retained to set up the&#13;
Commission; (b) to the Residential Advisor (below) who will provide day-to-day advice and&#13;
training to the staff of SRC; and (c) to GSE in matters of securities law. The cost of this&#13;
component is US$0.15 million over 30 months.&#13;
Institution building.&#13;
59.   Procurement of computer and communications equipment. The consultant retained&#13;
above will also assist in the procurement of the appropriate computer and communication&#13;
equipment. Procurement will be on a turn-key basis and will include the training of the SRC&#13;
staff and the implementation of the operating system. The cost of this component is&#13;
US$0.5 million.&#13;
Building local capacity.&#13;
60.   Resident advisor for Legislative reform and Training of staff. Once the&#13;
commission is set up, a resident advisor would provide technical advice to SRC, GSE and other&#13;
market participants for a period of 24 months. He will provide technical inputs to the&#13;
Securities Lawyer who will draft the regulations, procedures and code of conduct which the&#13;
SRC will implement. He will propose a detailed training program for the SRC, its staff and the&#13;
other market operators. The program will include courses in Accra and in capital market&#13;
centers abroad and information and familiarization trips to two or three major stock exchanges&#13;
abroad. The cost of this component is US$0.5 million over two years, including the cost of the&#13;
resident advisor (US$0.25 million over two years) and the cost of the training programs&#13;
(US$0.25 million).&#13;
C. Bank of Ghana.&#13;
61.   The NBFI Department at the BOG. Under the Financial Institutions (Non-Banking)&#13;
Law, 1993, BOG is responsible for licensing, regulating and supervising the nine different&#13;
types of NBFI providing a variety of services. These include deposit taking institutions such as&#13;
savings and loan institutions, credit unions and building societies; and financial intermediaries&#13;
specializing in leasing, mortgage financing and acceptances. BOG is in the process of&#13;
establishing the NBFI Department to regulate and supervise institutions covered by the law.&#13;
Regulations regarding the above institutions are being drafted in consultation with members of&#13;
the industry, however, some gaps remain in the effort to build in-house expertise for&#13;
satisfactory licensing and supervision of the non-bank financial sector.&#13;
Organization Structure.&#13;
62.   A consultant would be appointed to assist the resident advisor (below) to define the&#13;
resource requirements of the NBFI Department in terms of the organizational structure, needs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
assessment for an Management Information System (MIS) system and other equipment. The&#13;
cost of this study would be US$0.05 million over three months.&#13;
Institutional Building.&#13;
63.   This Credit would support procurement of equipment including computers, etc., based&#13;
on the requirements identified by the consultant above. The MIS system, including all the&#13;
hardware and software, must be fully compatible with the computer system currently being&#13;
installed in some parts of BOG under FINSAC II. The cost of this component is US$0.15&#13;
million, including hardware, software, and installation costs.&#13;
Regulatory Reforms&#13;
64.   With the assistance of an existing consultant, BOG has already started drafting&#13;
regulations for some categories of NBFI for circulation for comments by interested parties&#13;
(operating guidelines for S &amp; L were published in May 1995). However, the contract of this&#13;
consultant, who had been financed under FINSAC 11, is over and therefore under this Credit, a&#13;
Resident Advisor would be hired, probably a financial lawyer, in the Department for two years&#13;
to assist in making it fully operational. The Resident Advisor would provide day-to-day&#13;
technical advice, would review existing legislation, draft new regulations for each category of&#13;
NBFI and define organizational training needs (including a training plan for local and overseas&#13;
technical training for staff in the Department). The cost of this component is US$0.4 million.&#13;
Building Local Capacity.&#13;
65.   Local training programs, using local and foreign resource persons, would be prepared&#13;
based on the needs assessment conducted by the Consultant (hired under Organization&#13;
Structure component). In areas such as regulation of leasing companies and some other&#13;
specialized subjects, where overseas training may be the best and most cost-effective solution,&#13;
efforts would also be made to build local capacity for follow-up skills enrichment programs.&#13;
The Resident Advisor would actively assist in transferring skills and building local capacity.&#13;
This component will cost approximately US$0.325 million.&#13;
D. National Insurance Commission (NIC).&#13;
66.   Regulation, supervision and licensing in the insurance industry is the responsibility of&#13;
the NIC. But NIC has not been able to provide appropriate regulation and supervision for the&#13;
industry due to a shortage of financial resources, office space and qualified professional staff.&#13;
With assistance in the form of a loan from the insurance industry, NIC has agreed to acquire&#13;
office space from the DIC. While this credit would provide TA support to NIC, its move to&#13;
acceptable premises is a precondition for the successful implementation of the proposed&#13;
program to provide effective regulation and supervision of the insurance industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Organization Structure and Support to Insurance Supervision.&#13;
67.   Under this Credit support would be provided to NIC to hire a resident advisor, probably&#13;
an insurance supervision expert, for a two-year period. The advisor will initially assess needs&#13;
for the establishment of the commission, including design and implementation of an&#13;
organization structure, data collection and evaluation systems, as well as in training programs&#13;
for NIC staff, with special emphasis on the creation of adequate internal capacity in insurance&#13;
supervision. The advisor will also be responsible for the revision of the Insurance Law and&#13;
drafting of the Insurance Regulations. For this purpose, he would recruit the services of a&#13;
consultant team (discussed below) and would coordinate its activities. The advisor will support&#13;
NIC in implementing mechanisms and procedures for the enforcement of regulations, such as&#13;
liquidation of companies that do not satisfy capital adequacy guidelines. The advisor will&#13;
participate actively with NIC staff in on-site and off-site supervision and enforcement activity.&#13;
This component would cost US$0.375 million.&#13;
Legislative and Regulatory Reforms.&#13;
68.   Support would also be provided to NIC to hire a team of consultants, one expert in&#13;
insurance regulations and the other in drafting legal documents, for a period of six months.&#13;
This team would report to the advisor (above) and would submit the revised insurance&#13;
legislation to the government and the parliament for approval. Subsequently, the team would&#13;
undertake the preparation of updated regulations as well as the guidelines for prudential&#13;
supervision. This component will require twelve man-months of the consulting team at a cost&#13;
of US$0.2 million.&#13;
69.   While NIC agrees that it must move to a system of prudential supervision based on&#13;
monitoring the insurer's liquidity, solvency and risk-based capital adequacy, it had suggested&#13;
that NIC retain its veto power over policy wording and premium rate setting, because the&#13;
Ghanaian insurance industry was still in the early stages of development. Many consumers&#13;
were not well educated nor were they aware of their rights, and thus relied on NIC to protect&#13;
their interests. The team drafting the revised law and the regulations together with the Advisor&#13;
would consider this aspect when legislations are going to be reviewed. One option would be to&#13;
allow NIC to retain these veto powers for a certain number of years (say five years).&#13;
Companies would file proposed rate or wording changes with NIC but would not need NIC&#13;
approval to proceed, nor would requests for clarifications from NIC be reasons for delaying&#13;
product introduction. However, NIC would have the authority to query or even cancel a&#13;
proposed wording or rate change based on clearly specified objections, such as attempts by a&#13;
company to take undue advantage of customers, anti-competitive behavior, etc.&#13;
70.   A review of reinsurance legislation would also consider the following three options to&#13;
replace the current requirement that 20 percent of each insurance policy issued by every&#13;
primary insurer be reinsured with GRO: (a) this requirement simply be annulled with no&#13;
regulation on the amount of reinsurance required; (b) insurers be required to place a specified&#13;
percentage of their reinsurance business locally with one or more reinsurance companies&#13;
within Ghana on the basis of the overall portfolio rather than for every policy individually; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
(c) require companies to place a certain percentage of their reinsurance with local reinsurers on&#13;
first refusal basis, allowing them to take the business overseas if local reinsurance rates are&#13;
higher than rates available overseas. Legislation should be broad in its scope while the&#13;
regulations would be specific in their definition, linking this particular requirement to the&#13;
insurance capacity in the industry.&#13;
Institution Building.&#13;
71.   Under this Credit an MIS expert (data processing system for insurance supervision)&#13;
would be hired at NIC for four months to assess MIS needs and to procure hardware and&#13;
software. The cost of this component is US$0.5 million including the services of the MIS&#13;
expert, computer hardware and software and MIS training of NIC staff.&#13;
Building Local Capacity.&#13;
72.   The local capacity building need of NIC would be handled partly through Industry&#13;
Training Center, after the conversion of SIC's training center into an industry wide training&#13;
facility, and partly through programs at University of Ghana. The Resident Advisor would&#13;
assist in the preparation of a plan for overseas and local training for NIC staff which would cost&#13;
US$0.2 million.&#13;
.The Insurance Industry Structure.&#13;
73.   The insurance industry in Ghana consists of one large corporation, SIC, two medium&#13;
sized private companies, several small companies, and one state-owned reinsurance&#13;
organization, GRO. SIC dominates the industry (with nearly two-thirds of the total market) on&#13;
the basis of a monopoly on all GOG and SOE business (which accounts for nearly 40 percent&#13;
of the industry premiums) and GRO enjoys a monopoly with an obligatory legal cession of 20&#13;
percent on every insurance policy written.&#13;
E. State Insurance Corporation.&#13;
74.   GOG's program for the accelerated divestiture of state-owned enterprises and banks&#13;
could affect a substantial portion of SIC's business. SIC is to be reorganized with special&#13;
emphasis on new product development, more aggressive marketing and quick response to&#13;
clients prior to divestiture, expected by 1998. In view of the importance of SIC to the stability&#13;
of the insurance industry and the large number of employees at SIC, it has been agreed that SIC&#13;
would be restructured before divestiture. This is necessary to make SIC's operations more&#13;
efficient so that after restructuring of the industry it will be able to compete effectively on a&#13;
level playing field with other insurance companies.&#13;
Organizational restructuring.&#13;
75.   Under this Credit, an insurance industry expert would review options for strengthening&#13;
the organizational structure of SIC to help it operate more efficiently in a liberalized&#13;
environment, once its monopoly is removed. The consultant would work closely with the MIS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
expert (below) to identify the skills and equipment requirement and the organization structure&#13;
appropriate for SIC to operate as an internationally competitive private sector insurance&#13;
provider. This consultant is expected to take two months to complete the diagnostic phase and&#13;
then return for a period of four months (after the study has been approved) to assist SIC in the&#13;
implementation of the action plan. The estimated cost of this component is about US$0.1&#13;
million.&#13;
Institution Building.&#13;
76.   Through computerization and upgrading of the technical operations in the underwriting&#13;
department, this credit would support SIC's ongoing computerization program by using a&#13;
specialized MIS expert for 3 months to: (a) evaluate the existing computerization plan&#13;
specially with the view to establishing a local area network and designing an MIS; and (b)&#13;
evaluate the hardware and software needs of the corporation and prepare an implementation&#13;
strategy for the computerization program. The total cost of this component including the cost&#13;
of an MIS expert for three months, hardware/software, and computer is US$1.95 million,&#13;
which includes US$0.2 million retroactive financing for equipment already contracted for&#13;
purchase provided procurement has been made in accordance with the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
Preparing SICfor divestiture.&#13;
77.   This credit would support the services of Divestiture Specialists (individual firm or&#13;
consortium of experts) to assist GOG in its efforts to divest its shareholding in SIC. The&#13;
responsibility for policy decisions (timing, etc.) related to the divestiture of SIC rests with&#13;
MOF but DIC and SEC would be involved in the execution of the divestiture process,&#13;
including the selection of Divestiture Specialists. The Divestiture Specialists will undertake a&#13;
valuation of the firm, assess an appropriate sale price, devise a sale program and assist in the&#13;
effective implementation of the divestiture exercise. The Divestiture Group would comprise&#13;
investment bankers, lawyers and accountants to prepare SIC for divestiture, prepare required&#13;
documentation and solicit interested parties. The cost of this component is US$0.25 million.&#13;
78.   In the event SIC is privatized before the expected date, it was agreed that the&#13;
Government, in consultation with IDA, would have the option of reallocating the funds for the&#13;
local capacity building, market and product development components to one of the other&#13;
beneficiaries under the project. It was also agreed that should the Government decide to&#13;
implement the privatization component of SIC before the institution building component&#13;
(including computerization), the prospective buyer would be given the option of buying SIC&#13;
"as-is" or having GOG implement the computerization program, the cost of which would be&#13;
reflected in the sale price.&#13;
Building Local Capacity.&#13;
79.   The local capacity building component of SIC would be handled through the industry&#13;
training center (after the present SIC's training center is converted into the industry wide&#13;
training center). The consultant (hired under Organizational Restructuring component) would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
assist in the preparation of the local and overseas training program for SIC staff. The budget&#13;
for the overseas and local training program (excluding computer training) for SIC staff is&#13;
US$0.2 million.&#13;
Improved marketing strategyfor new insurance products and product development.&#13;
80.   Under this credit, an advisor would be appointed for one year to develop new products&#13;
and markets with special focus on attracting business from industries such as mining, timber&#13;
and cocoa and on developing new life insurance products which are attractive under&#13;
inflationary conditions. The results of this initiative will be available equally to all insurance&#13;
and reinsurance companies. However, the effort would be coordinated at SIC only because it&#13;
provides the commercial environment necessary for successful product development. The&#13;
advisor will work closely with NIC and the industry training center. The estimated cost of this&#13;
component is US$0.125 million.&#13;
F. Ghana Reinsurance Organization (GRO).&#13;
81.   GRO operates on commercial principles but nearly 60 percent of its gross revenues are&#13;
derived from its monopoly. Under GOG's privatization plan, GRO is expected to be divested&#13;
by 1998 after removing the monopoly in its favor and converting it into a limited liability&#13;
company. Under this corporate plan there would be no need to restructure GRO before&#13;
privatization. However, the changing environment in the industry warrants that GRO diversify&#13;
its markets and undertake a skills enrichment program to ensure long-term sustainability in an&#13;
industry where rules are to change in favor of a level playing field. The first step, however,&#13;
would be the conversion of GRO into a limited liability company, according to the Companies&#13;
Code.&#13;
Institution Building.&#13;
82.   Under this credit, an MIS expert would be hired for 3 months to implement a plan to&#13;
upgrade the technical operations of GRO, including procurement and installation of hardware&#13;
and software packages and training for staff at a cost of US$0.325 million. The expert would&#13;
be available for two phases: first phase of one month to define the need and prepare&#13;
procurement documents; and, second phase to prepare reports after receiving bids from vendors&#13;
and preparation of training program.&#13;
Preparing GROfor privatization.&#13;
83.   This Credit would support the appointment of a Divestiture Group, comprising&#13;
investment bankers, lawyers and accountants, to assist GRO in incorporation as a private&#13;
limited liability company (and assist in any required amendment to the GRO Law, 1984 by&#13;
proposing revised legislation), prepare the offer documents, and seek suitable investors. The&#13;
responsibility for policy decisions (timing, etc.) related to the divestiture of GRO rests with&#13;
MOF but DIC and State Enterprises Corporation (SEC) would be involved in the execution of&#13;
the divestiture process, including the selection of Divestiture Specialists. In line with the need&#13;
to increase capital, GOG may consider the issue of new shares in addition to, or instead of,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
selling its existing shares to the private investors (thus increasing GRO capital by diluting&#13;
GOG holdings). The cost of this component is US$0.25 million.&#13;
84.  In the event GRO is privatized before the expected date, it was agreed that the&#13;
Government, in consultation with IDA, would have the option of reallocating the funds for the&#13;
local capacity building, market and product development components to one of the other&#13;
beneficiaries under the project. It was also agreed that should the Government decide to&#13;
implement the privatization component of GRO before the institution building component&#13;
(including computerization), the prospective buyer would be given the option of buying GRO&#13;
"as-is" or having GOG implement the computerization program, the cost of which would be&#13;
reflected in the sale price.&#13;
Building Local Capacity.&#13;
85.   The local capacity building component of GRO would be handled through conversion&#13;
of SIC's training center into industry training center and the Resident Advisor would assist&#13;
GRO in the preparation of a training plan for overseas training of its staff, the cost of which is&#13;
included in the market and product development component below.&#13;
Market and Product Diversification.&#13;
86.   Under this Credit a Resident Advisor, an expert on reinsurance marketing, would be&#13;
hired for a period of one year to help GRO diversify its markets and to develop new products.&#13;
The Resident Advisor would also evaluate the risks and rewards resulting from the entry of&#13;
GRO into the local primary insurance market. He would also participate in local capacity&#13;
building programs within the company and in the implementation of a twinning arrangement&#13;
with an internationally known reinsurance company for up to eighteen months, to assist in&#13;
market development, skills transfer and if direct underwriting is to be added to GRO's&#13;
business, then assistance in introducing these services. The twinning arrangement, the skills&#13;
transfer and overseas training program, and the Resident Advisor would be US$0.475 million.&#13;
G. Social Security And National Insurance Trust (SSNIT).&#13;
87.   SSNIT, which is a statutory body governed by the Social Security Law, 1991, has&#13;
administered the social security plan since it was restructured in 1991. It collects social&#13;
security contributions and makes payments under three main benefits: (a) old age pension; (b)&#13;
disability pension; and (c) lumpsum survivors benefit. It operates a partially-fumded, defined-&#13;
benefit scheme to which all establishments (except the armed forces which is exempt and self-&#13;
employed individuals whose participation is voluntary) are required to contribute a total of 17.5&#13;
percent of the salary of every employee (5 percent by the employee and 12.5 percent by the&#13;
employer). SSNIT's operations were review recently by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, in a study&#13;
financed by FINSAC II. The review concluded that SSNIT was an efficiently managed&#13;
institution and based on acceptable assumptions, SSNIT was expected to remain solvent for the&#13;
next 20 years. This conclusion was supported by the triennial actuarial review of SSNIT&#13;
carried out by the US Social Security Administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
88.   SSNIT's role in stimulating the development of financial markets was restricted by&#13;
Government regulations but these were removed in 1991. Consequently, unlike most other&#13;
countries, where prudential guidelines govern the investment portfolio of the social security&#13;
fund in an attempt to limit exposure to risk and ensure liquidity and solvency, SSNIT is now&#13;
free to determine its portfolio. Therefore, SSNIT has formulated guidelines for the&#13;
management of its investment portfolio. A copy of these policy guidelines have been provided&#13;
to the Bank for suggestions on strengthening them.&#13;
89.   SSNIT is managed by a Board of Directors appointed by GOG according to the&#13;
provisions of the Social Security Law, 1991. SSNIT's net assets, as of December 31, 1994,&#13;
were C 297 billion and income for the year 1994 was C 111 billion, making it the largest NBFI&#13;
and the second largest financial institution in the country (after Ghana Commercial Bank). As&#13;
the single largest investor in Ghana, SSNIT plays a very important role in stimulating the&#13;
development of the capital markets and in providing long-term finance to the Ghanaian&#13;
economy. Under this project assistance would be provided to SSNIT for skills enhancement&#13;
and product and market development.&#13;
Capacity Building.&#13;
90.   While SSNIT conducts most of its operational training in-house, there is a need to&#13;
utilize external training for specific categories of management and operational staff,&#13;
particularly in strengthening investment management and actuarial skills. Since training for&#13;
actuaries is usually provided on-the-job, SSNIT would like to make arrangements for&#13;
attachments of four-to six months for selected staff at social security, reinsurance or insurance&#13;
companies in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. In&#13;
addition, funding would be provided to cover the cost of the triennial actuarial review, which&#13;
uses specialized actuaries and accountants, so that it may be used to build skills locally through&#13;
transfer of technology. Local and overseas training would also be provided for investment&#13;
managers and other staff in specific areas. The cost of this component is US$0.75 million over&#13;
a four year period.&#13;
Market and Product Development.&#13;
91.   SSNIT currently has roughly 670,000 contributors, which is estimated to represent only&#13;
about 10 percent of the Ghanaian work force. Even though the law covers all employees, the&#13;
majority of the workers are not in the system currently because they work in the informal&#13;
sector. The current defined benefit scheme based on a 17.5 percent contribution is not viewed&#13;
as satisfying the needs of these people in the informal sector. Hence SSNIT is interested in&#13;
designing social security schemes and life insurance programs that would respond to the needs&#13;
of this category of workers. While SSNIT has started collecting some data that might be useful&#13;
for this purpose, it would like to benefit from experiences that other countries have had in this&#13;
area. Under this credit, provision is being made for SSNIT to exchange experiences and know-&#13;
how through a twinning arrangement or through the use of consultants experienced in the&#13;
design and operation of social security and pension fund schemes for workers in the small and&#13;
informal sectors. The cost of this component is US$0.5 million over a two year period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
H. Associated Infrastructure and Capacity Building.&#13;
92.   One of the key objectives of the project is the creation of local capacity to enable the&#13;
non-bank financial sector in Ghana to develop the skills-base required to sustain its projected&#13;
growth. Capacity building is necessary at three different levels. Firstly, the foundation of&#13;
skills development is at the undergraduate and graduate levels, where greater exposure must be&#13;
provided to concepts relating to the non-bank financial sector. Secondly, there should be&#13;
opportunities to build on the above foundation with formal, professional training in various&#13;
sub-sectors of the non-bank financial sector, for instance, similar to the activities of the&#13;
Institute of Bankers in Ghana in the banking sector. Thirdly, there is a need for skills&#13;
upgrading for professionals already working in the non-bank financial sector.&#13;
93.   To support capacity building at these three levels, the project would provide technical&#13;
assistance and institutional support for: (a) GSE's in-house training facility in the form of&#13;
training material and equipment (discussed above under GSE); (b) SIC's training center for its&#13;
strengthening as a center for the entire insurance industry; (c) HFC for the capacity building&#13;
and institutional strengthening through twinning arrangements; (d) School of Administration at&#13;
the University of Ghana in the form of equipment, training material, and trainers for financial&#13;
sector issues; (e) institution building support for ICAG; and (f) a diagnostic review by MOF to&#13;
design a sustainable structure for the Management Development and Productivity Institute&#13;
(MDPI).&#13;
I. Insurance Industry Training Center.&#13;
94.   Agreement has been reached with SIC, NIC, GRO and other members of the industry to&#13;
convert SIC's existing training center, which offers training courses for new employees,&#13;
advanced courses for middle management, and other specialized courses for insurance agents,&#13;
into an industry-wide facility owned on a cooperative basis by all interested participants on a&#13;
voluntary basis. Similar to the structure created for the National Banking College, SIC would&#13;
sell or lease the facility jointly to interested industry participants on the basis of a fair sharing&#13;
of the cost, based on some appropriate formula, such as size within the industry and planned&#13;
utilization. The training center could be managed by a managing committee, whose members&#13;
would represent each major owner. This managing committee would be responsible for hiring&#13;
managers to operate the center and for supervising the management of the center. Operating&#13;
and investment expenses would require prior approval of the managing committee representing&#13;
the owners, who would share any portion of the operating expenses which may not be covered&#13;
by revenues generated from fees and charges for training programs etc. Capital investments&#13;
would also be financed jointly.&#13;
New Ownership Structure of the Training Center.&#13;
95.   Legal assistance would be provided to SIC to implement the actual spin-off of the&#13;
center from SIC into a cooperatively owned, independent center. This would require services&#13;
of a local lawyer for three months at a cost of US$30,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
Institution Building.&#13;
96.   This Credit would support hiring of a consultant, an insurance training expert, for a&#13;
period of one year to review and expand various training programs offered at the center for new&#13;
employees, middle management and agents, for seminars and for advanced courses and for&#13;
some essential upgrading of the facilities at the SIC training center. The consultant would also&#13;
review the possibility of providing preparatory courses to students appearing for the Fellow of&#13;
Chartered Institute of Insurance (FCII) and the Associate of the Chartered Institute of Insurance&#13;
(ACII) examinations, would prepare plans for procuring textbooks and audio-visual equipment&#13;
and would assist in the development of training material. The cost of this component is&#13;
US$0.55 million, including US$0.2 million for the insurance industry training expert and&#13;
upgrading of existing facilities, and US$0.35 million for training material and equipment.&#13;
J. Home Finance Company.&#13;
97.   Due to the current relatively high inflation and interest rates, most financial assets and&#13;
liabilities in Ghana are short term. However, two modes of term finance have become&#13;
increasingly popular in Ghana--leasing, with 2-5 years financing, and inflation linked mortgage&#13;
loans for housing, with 15-20 years financing. The institutions providing these types of&#13;
financing are regulated by BOG within the framework of the Financial Institutions (Non-&#13;
Banking) Law, 1993. Also, due to high inflation and high interest rates, nominal housing loans&#13;
are not good instruments to resolve the long term housing needs of the population. Building&#13;
societies, structured after the British model, mobilize only small amounts of resources and&#13;
commercial banks concentrate mostly on short-term finance. HFC has initiated an innovative&#13;
housing finance scheme, based on linking mortgage loan repayments to inflation rates. HFC&#13;
has recently mobilized additional capital by offering 25 percent of its capital to the public.&#13;
HFC shares will now be traded in the GSE. HFC is also planning to issue linked bonds secured&#13;
by its mortgages to the public, which would also be quoted on the GSE.&#13;
Institution Building.&#13;
98.   Under this credit support would be provided to HFC to procure and install hardware&#13;
and software for inflation-linked loans for use by HFC and by first-tier mortgage finance&#13;
institutions at a cost of US$0.5 million.&#13;
Capacity Building.&#13;
99.   This credit would support HFC on its proposal for training of its professional staff, and&#13;
transfer of technology through twinning arrangements with similar institutions in three&#13;
countries: Malaysia, where a similar second-tier mortgage financing is active; Israel, where&#13;
inflation-linked mortgage financing is popular; and India, where HFC has identified solutions&#13;
to the issue of construction finance for contractors. It is estimated that a total of two years of&#13;
twinning arrangements with the three institutions, including provision for experts to visit&#13;
Ghana for training programs and seminars, is expected to cost US$0.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
K. University of Ghana School of Administration.&#13;
100.  University of Ghana School of Administration offers a two year diploma, Bachelor's&#13;
and Master's degrees in Business and Public Administration. Specialization includes finance,&#13;
accounting and insurance. In addition to the degree courses, the school conducts a variety of&#13;
executive development programs for the private sector companies, including courses tailored to&#13;
the needs of a particular company. This credit would support a proposal submitted by the&#13;
School Of Administration on the resources required for a three-year program to expand and&#13;
improve its executive development programs and would be linked to number of student-days of&#13;
executive development training provided by the School of Administration. This component&#13;
includes equipment, training material and training at a total cost of US$0.6 million.&#13;
L. Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ghana (ICAG).&#13;
101.  ICAG has received support under FINSAC I and II. While its revenues from&#13;
membership subscription and examination fees do not cover the cost of supporting student&#13;
training programs, it is expected that proposed cost reductions and increased fees would enable&#13;
it to cover its current operating deficit. Meanwhile, to continue the support provided by&#13;
FINSAC, support would be provided to ICAG for a one-time assistance of US$75,000 for&#13;
training equipment and material.&#13;
M. Management Development and Productivity Institute.&#13;
102.  Before an assistance program can be designed for the Institute, it is necessary to&#13;
undertake a comprehensive review of the objectives of the Institute in the context of other&#13;
similar institutes in Accra, its target audience and its mission statement. Based on these goals&#13;
and the target audience identified, MDPI would be able to prepare a plan for sustainable growth&#13;
over a specified time frame and identify the associated financial requirements. It was agreed&#13;
with GOG that the Implementation Agency, MOF, would use a training specialist to conduct a&#13;
diagnostic review and prepare an implementation plan for MDPI. The cost of this component&#13;
is US$50,000.&#13;
N. Payment Systems.&#13;
103.  The need for payment systems reform and modernization has been mentioned in some&#13;
of the earlier reports of the Bank, such as "Ghana: Accelerated Growth Study" and "Ghana&#13;
Financial Sector: Bringing Savers and Investors Together". These reports had pointed out that&#13;
lack of efficient payment systems was impeding public expenditure management on the one&#13;
hand, and sterilizing a quarter of M2 as float on the other (a detailed description of the&#13;
payments system in Ghana is given in Attachment 1). A diagnostic study of payment systems&#13;
in Ghana and areas for reform and modernization were clearly identified and agreed upon with&#13;
the Government.&#13;
104.  Payment Systems and Postal Giro Studies. In order to make a thorough and in-depth&#13;
assessment of the user needs that would guide the installation of an optimum payments&#13;
infrastructure covering cash and non-cash payments and to evaluate the alternatives available&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
within the constraints of the Ghanaian situation, a payments system study by a firm of&#13;
international repute would need to be commissioned by BOG. The general principles guiding&#13;
such a study are given in Attachment 1. In order to provide payments and funds transfer&#13;
facilities in those places that do not have adequate banking coverage and to introduce a degree&#13;
of competition in these services, postal giro services should be introduced in Ghana. The&#13;
satellite-based data communication capability that will shortly become available in the private&#13;
sector would be used to link 100 postal locations through the very small aperture terminal&#13;
(VSAT). Computer hardware and software would be provided for accounts maintenance, and&#13;
human resources geared up for this new service. Since this effort will require substantial&#13;
groundwork on the part of Ghana Posts and Telegraph (GP&amp;T), GP&amp;T will be asked to initiate&#13;
work on the design and staff training needs of a postal giro. A separate study will be&#13;
commissioned for this purpose. The cost for the above two studies is estimated at US$0.5&#13;
million.&#13;
105.  Legislative Reform. To put payments, clearing and settlement on a sound footing and&#13;
enhance confidence in the use of non-cash payment instruments, it is necessary to develop&#13;
appropriate legislative and regulatory framework. For this purpose, a firm of legal consultants&#13;
would be retained by BOG to study models of such laws in developed economies and define&#13;
the most desirable features for the Ghanaian system. The cost of this component is US$0.2&#13;
million.&#13;
Institution Building&#13;
106.  Establishing Financial Data Communications Infrastructure. A data&#13;
communications network is the backbone which enables transition from paper to electronic&#13;
modes of payment, clearing and settlement, and hence to greater speed and security in&#13;
payments. The emerging preferred technology for the purpose is VSAT using adequately&#13;
leased bandwidth from one of the commercial satellites with a footprint over the targeted area.&#13;
The major expense here is for setting up a satellite hub, which would be borne by private firms&#13;
licensed by GOG to provide satellite-based communications services. Some of these&#13;
companies hope to have hubs on the ground by the end of 1995. The funding needs would now&#13;
relate to computer hardware and software required by the users to link to the network, and in&#13;
some cases VSAT dishes and related equipment (as specified in the following paragraphs under&#13;
Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) for high value funds transfer and networked automated&#13;
teller machine (ATM) capability). GOG is interested in ensuring that the network is designed&#13;
to permit cost-effective expansions of the network as and when needed to satisfy the needs of&#13;
other sectors of the economy, such as education, etc.&#13;
107.  RTGS for High value Funds Transfer. The two objectives here would be to allow&#13;
immediate transaction settlement in the high-value funds market, and provide a basis for&#13;
Delivery vs. Payment (DVP) ability in the securities markets. RTGS implies that high-value&#13;
funds transfers among banks (for trading on their own account or on clients) are settled on the&#13;
books of the central bank on a transaction by transaction basis. DVP implies that payments for&#13;
completed securities trades are settled almost simultaneously. Both measures reduce credit and&#13;
liquidity risks in financial markets to a minimum.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
108.  The network requirements for an RTGS can be met by using the VSAT capability now&#13;
being installed, or by leased lines from GP&amp;T if the network is expected to be limited to Accra.&#13;
The former is preferable as it could induce new financial services providers to locate outside&#13;
Accra. The RTGS would then require a host computer at BOG and associated customized&#13;
software. The cost of this component would be US$1.5 million.&#13;
109.  Networked ATM capability. One of the measures which can address the reluctance of&#13;
savers to deposit relatively small amounts in banks (Attachment 1) is the use of ATM.&#13;
However, ATM are expensive, and no one bank may find it profitable to install more than a&#13;
few strategically located ATM. The satellite-based networking capability makes it possible for&#13;
banks to have a shared ATM network with minimum capital investment by each bank. The&#13;
requirement here would then relate to the central computer facility and related software for&#13;
executing and settling ATM transactions across banks. It is conceivable that the private&#13;
network providers may in due course offer such a facility and hence promote the installation of&#13;
a larger number of ATM. The design of this network would also assist in improving&#13;
availability of cash, service quality and security for users keeping in mind the very high usage&#13;
of cash in Ghana.&#13;
110.  Computerization and Automation of Clearinghouses. The objective here would be&#13;
to speed up the clearing and settlement of checks to make them more attractive as payment&#13;
instruments and thus reduce the dominance of cash. The measures required here would&#13;
supplement the ongoing computerization of BOG under FINSAC II through financing of&#13;
components such as computerization of the clearing house which are not covered by FINSAC&#13;
II, and related issues. As far as settlement is concerned, the requirement would be to install&#13;
relatively small computers (pentiums at other centers, a mini-computer at Accra), necessary&#13;
software and printers at the 11 clearinghouses across the country. These would be used for:&#13;
(a) settlement of local clearing; and (b) communication of intercity clearing effects over the&#13;
network already envisaged in BOG plan. The cost of this component is US$0.5 million.&#13;
111.  To speed up the clearing process, BOG has already initiated work on the introduction of&#13;
magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) checks. Together with the introduction of MICR&#13;
checks, banks will install encoders on their premises, and there will be need for reader-sorters&#13;
to capture information off the checks for settlement purposes. The estimated requirement for&#13;
reader-sorters at Accra (which has sufficient volumes to justify automation) would be US$0.85&#13;
million.&#13;
Building Local Capacity.&#13;
112.  In order to develop human resources to manage the new systems suggested above,&#13;
training and skills enhancement will be required, in addition to the training provided by&#13;
equipment and software vendors, at two levels: (a) decision-making levels; and (b) operational&#13;
levels. At the decision making level two workshops could be organized by the National&#13;
Payments Council: (a) a workshop to understand the critical role of data communications&#13;
technology in funds transfers and the expansion of efficient financial services; and (b) a&#13;
workshop to understand the operational requirements that go into the provision of services such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
as ATM, electronic funds transfer and computerized clearing and settlement. At the&#13;
operational level training would have to imparted in about 5 batches of 20 each to personnel of&#13;
the financial industry who operate the electronic systems to be installed. This training would&#13;
cover ability to use communications software, data management and electronic transfer. The&#13;
cost of this component is US$0.25 million.&#13;
113.  In order to provide continuous support and expert advice on implementation of the&#13;
payment systems modernization project in all its ramifications, a payment systems expert will&#13;
be posted at BOG for a period of two years. The cost of this component is US$0.25 million&#13;
over the two years.&#13;
0. Ministry of Finance (MOF).&#13;
114.  Financial Services for the Informal and Rural Sectors. MOF plans to undertake a&#13;
diagnostic review with the objective of addressing constraints to the availability of financial&#13;
services for small savers and borrowers in urban and rural areas. The methodology of the&#13;
review would be: (a) to collate and recap the substantial amount of literature that is already&#13;
available on this subject in Ghana and at the Bank; (b) to assess the needs of target groups and&#13;
institutions for access to savings and credit, some of which have been identified below; (c) to&#13;
analyze some of the internationally acclaimed success stories of institutions (such as BKK in&#13;
Indonesia, Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and other examples from Thailand, India, Brazil and&#13;
Latin America) which have demonstrated the ability to reach significant numbers of people&#13;
who traditionally have the least access to financial services, both savings and credit; and (d) to&#13;
use the above reviews to investigate the feasibility of adapting one of these successful&#13;
institutions to the Ghanaian environment on a pilot basis.&#13;
115.  This review would assess the needs of institutions and mechanisms which provide&#13;
financial services for small and micro productive enterprises and initiatives by those in the&#13;
poorest segments of the society, both in the agricultural sector and the non-agricultural sector,&#13;
such as artisans, small traders, hairdressers, tailors, peasant farmers, etc. This review would&#13;
cover informal savings and credit mechanisms such as susu collectors, small and micro&#13;
entrepreneurs (Council of Independent Business Association as well as the National Bureau of&#13;
Small Scale Industries), relatively "formal" institutions such as community banks and S&amp;Ls,&#13;
cooperative institutions, small scale finance institutions such as Women's World Banking, etc.,&#13;
formal sector rural banks and non-bank institutions, as well as consumers such as teachers,&#13;
workers, civil servants, students, etc.&#13;
116.  This project would provide technical assistance for the diagnostic review and the design&#13;
of the pilot program. It would also provide technical assistance for the follow-on pilot&#13;
initiative based on the design recommended by the diagnostic studies. The cost of this&#13;
component is estimated at US$3.75 million, comprising US$0.75 million for six to twelve&#13;
months of detailed diagnostic reviews and preparatory exercises, including seminars and other&#13;
participatory planning activities needed to design the pilot program for Ghana, and US$3.0&#13;
million for the implementation of the pilot project, which would be used for technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
assistance to promote financial intermediaries, including support for institution building, start-&#13;
up costs such as promotion and necessary regulatory and supervisory changes.&#13;
117.  This component will be guided by the Financial Sector Oversight Committee in the&#13;
Office of the Presidency and would be coordinated on a day-to-day basis by an advisor to be&#13;
appointed at MOF for two years. The Bank's Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest would&#13;
also participate in this component by providing technical support for the diagnostic review and&#13;
the follow-on pilot program.&#13;
118.  Privatization Trust (PT). The creation of a PT is another instrument to foster the&#13;
public placement of the shares of public enterprises to be privatized under the accelerated&#13;
divestiture program. A detailed description of the PT is given in Attachment 2. Under the PT&#13;
scheme, the government would place blocks of minority shares of the public enterprises being&#13;
divested with a trust which would be managed by a private portfolio manager. The shares&#13;
would be held in the trust for a period not exceeding three years and would then be sold to:&#13;
(a) the personnel of the public enterprise being privatized; (b) the Ghanaian public; and&#13;
(c) institutional investors. Once the privatization program is completed and all the shares held&#13;
in the PT are sold, the trust would be liquidated.&#13;
119.  The management of the PT portfolio by the Management Company would be controlled&#13;
and supervised by a Board of Trustees, which may be composed of five members as follows:&#13;
(a) one high level representative from MOF; (b) one high level representative from DIC;&#13;
(c) two chief executive officers of private sector enterprises; and (d) an independent financial&#13;
expert. Once appropriate approvals are received, a financial expert and a lawyer would be&#13;
retained to work closely with the Implementation Agency, MOF, to help set up the Trust and&#13;
draft the legal documentation for establishing the Trust. The cost of this component is&#13;
US$0.45 million, including US$0.15 million in total for the financial expert and the lawyer and&#13;
US$0.3 million as a provision for the payment of the management fees during the initial set-up&#13;
period before the proceeds from the first sales of shares are received by the PT. This&#13;
component would be implemented in close coordination with the DIC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
120.  Though the project has eleven beneficiaries, the program design has been kept as&#13;
simple as possible. With very few exceptions, the program for each beneficiary is independent&#13;
from that of other beneficiaries. This structure of parallel but unrelated programs minimizes&#13;
complexity in the implementation of the project. Nevertheless, the role of the implementing&#13;
agency is critical in view of coordination required for the effective supervision of the large&#13;
number of beneficiaries.&#13;
A. Project Implementation.&#13;
121.  It has been agreed with GOG that MOF will be the implementing agency for this&#13;
project. For this purpose, a Project Coordinating and Implementation Team consisting of one&#13;
advisor with experience in private sector NBFI and one support staff has been established at&#13;
MOF under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister of Finance. Each beneficiary will appoint&#13;
one representative to PCT to assist in project administration and implementation. The project&#13;
would provide US$0.6 million to establish the PCT (including US$0.1 million as operating&#13;
costs for recurrent expenditures such as fuel cost, office supplies, vehicle and equipment&#13;
maintenance). The PCT will be chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. While each&#13;
beneficiary would have primary responsibility for the implementation of its own components,&#13;
the PCT would be responsible for coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the&#13;
project, and for reporting to IDA as defined in the draft Project Implementation Manual to be&#13;
adopted by the time of credit effectiveness. The PCT would be the vehicle for coordination,&#13;
contact, follow-up and reporting between IDA and the beneficiaries.&#13;
122.  The PCT would require accounting and financial management services to oversee the&#13;
project's financial aspects which would be provided by an independent accounting firm, on a&#13;
part-time basis. All project accounts, the Special Accounts, the Statements of Expenditure and&#13;
the financial statements of the project beneficiaries would be audited at the end of each fiscal&#13;
year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, based on accounting data produced by the&#13;
independent accounting firm. While each beneficiary would have primary responsibility for&#13;
procurement related to its components, its representative to PCT would update Procurement&#13;
Schedules and provide reports on related activities to ensure compliance with IDA&#13;
requirements. The PCT would hire the services of a procurement and disbursement specialist&#13;
(familiar with Bank processes and guidelines) to assist the beneficiaries in the preparation and&#13;
evaluation of bid documents to ensure consistency with Bank guidelines. Agreement has- been&#13;
reached with the borrower on the standard processing time for procurement of goods and&#13;
consultants (see section C.3 for details on standard processing time for procurement of goods&#13;
and consultants).&#13;
123.  Semi-annual project implementation reviews would be conducted by IDA together with&#13;
each beneficiary to review the implementation of all components, including the status of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
procurement and disbursement. Supervision reviews, including a joint IDA-GOG mid-term&#13;
review, would monitor the overall project execution, key project activities, project&#13;
implementation schedule, and supervision plans. They will also identify implementation issues&#13;
and develop solutions. Following project completion, scheduled for December 31, 1999, a&#13;
project implementation completion report would be prepared by IDA and GOG. Though MOF,&#13;
through PCT, would have the overall responsibility for coordination, it will utilize outside&#13;
resources for the execution of the project. Consultants, contractors and suppliers would be&#13;
selected in accordance with Bank guidelines, on the basis of proven experience in the financial&#13;
sector. In line with the Bank's Africa Regional guidelines, wherever possible, local consultants&#13;
will be used. Where foreign consultants are used for lack of requisite local skills, special&#13;
attention will be given to promote transfer of skills to the domestic industry using local&#13;
counterpart teams. Consultant and advisor contracts would include provisions for training and&#13;
transfer of skills (e.g., through shared management) to local counterparts to carry on with the&#13;
program independently. Each beneficiary would therefore appoint counterparts who would&#13;
work closely with the advisor and would also make adequate preparations before the arrival of&#13;
the advisor in order to ensure the effective utilization of his services.&#13;
124.  Beneficiaries' contribution to Supervision. The PCT is responsible for overall&#13;
project implementation in matters relating to financial control, implementation, procurement,&#13;
and maintenance of records on transactions on all the project components. They will be&#13;
required to submit or contribute to the following:&#13;
(a)   Semi-annual progress reports should cover utilization of the funds and status of&#13;
completion of the studies and implementation of recommendations made under&#13;
these studies. The information contained in these reports will be used to&#13;
formulate specific TOR for each supervision mission.&#13;
(b)   Project review meeting with the participation of the various project agencies to&#13;
be held during the semi-annual supervision missions each year. The heads of&#13;
beneficiaries assisted by the representative on PCT would be responsible for&#13;
coordinating information and supervision pertaining to the implementation of&#13;
their component. Mission briefing on arrival and wrap-up meetings will be&#13;
attended by the implementing agency managers.&#13;
(c)   Audited reports on the special accounts, statements of expenditures, project&#13;
accounts and financial statements to be submitted within six months after the&#13;
end of each fiscal year by the Government.&#13;
125.  Mid-term review. It will be an important dimension of the mid-term review to assess&#13;
the overall success of the various components, not simply by using accounting standards but&#13;
more by evaluating and surveying the beneficiaries of the programs. The mid-term review will&#13;
review the following:&#13;
(a)   the adequacy of institutional arrangements and implementation of the various&#13;
components of the project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
(b)   progress with implementing all components of the project including training&#13;
programs; progress will be viewed in relation to established monitoring&#13;
indicators; and&#13;
(c)   procurement status for all project components.&#13;
126.  Specifically, the mid-tern review will also review and assess the following:&#13;
(a)   implementation of clearing and settlement system at GSE;&#13;
(b)   diagnostic review of financial services for informal and rural sectors&#13;
component;&#13;
(c)   payment systems study for BOG;&#13;
(d)   restructuring and divestiture of SIC by 1998; and&#13;
(e)   strengthening and divestiture of GRO by 1998.&#13;
At least 45 days prior to the mid-term review, the Government should transmit to IDA a report&#13;
describing the status of the items listed above.&#13;
127.  Supervision Missions. Two supervision missions per year will take place with the first&#13;
mission within three months of Board Presentation to review pre-effectiveness and project&#13;
launch; conditions of effectiveness; annual work program for the first year of project review;&#13;
and review of procurement documents.&#13;
B. Onlending Terms of financing for the beneficiaries.&#13;
128.  The proceeds of this NBFI Credit would be extended by the borrower (GOG) to the non&#13;
revenue generating beneficiaries in the form of grants and in the form of loans to revenue&#13;
generating entities such as SIC, GRO and HFC, only for the components dealing with&#13;
hardware, software and equipment. However, each beneficiary would finance five percent of&#13;
the cost of each component as the beneficiary's share of the project cost.&#13;
129.  Onlending to beneficiaries by GOG would be in cedis based on a variable "reference&#13;
interest rate" (RIR), based on a market determined average cost of 180-day deposits mobilized&#13;
by three banks (to be agreed at the time of drawing up the on-lending agreements), reflecting&#13;
the cost of domestic funds to the banking sector. The RIR would be adjusted twice a year, each&#13;
January 1 and July 1, to establish the interest rate applicable for the next interest period.&#13;
Repayment of principal by beneficiaries due on each January I and July I would be on the&#13;
basis of amortization schedule established on the date of the drawdown of the loan. Loan&#13;
maturities for beneficiaries will not be greater than ten years with up to three years of grace.&#13;
The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the Government for a fee implicit in the&#13;
difference between the nominal cost of the IDA Credit and the interest paid to it by the&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
C. Project Costs and Financing Plan.&#13;
130.  The estimated project cost is US$24.9 million equivalent, of which approximately&#13;
US$3.125 million is for GSE, US$1.25 million for SRC, US$0.925 million for BOG's NBFI&#13;
Department, US$1.275 million for NIC, US$2.625 million for SIC, US$1.05 million for GRO,&#13;
US$1.25 million for SSNIT, US$1.0 million for HFC, US$1.255 for School of Administration,&#13;
Insurance Industry Training Center and ICAG, US$4.05 million for Payment Systems,&#13;
US$4.85 million for MOF (of which, US$3.75 million for provision of financial services to&#13;
informal and rural sectors component, US$0.45 million for PT, US$0.6 million for PCT and&#13;
US$50,000 for MDPI ), and US$2.245 million for unallocated and contingencies. Out of&#13;
US$24.9 million, IDA is expected to provide US$23.9 million and the remaining US$1 million&#13;
will come from the beneficiaries (US$0.5 million) and GOG (US$0.5 million).&#13;
D. Procurement.&#13;
131.  Two types of procurement would be undertaken through the Credit: (a) consultant&#13;
services for 9 beneficiaries; and (b) goods, primarily computer software and hardware and&#13;
communications and office equipment for 11 beneficiaries.&#13;
132.  Selection and appointment of consultants for studies, technical assistance, and support&#13;
of project execution would be carried out in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines: Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency" (August&#13;
1981), on the basis of proven experience in the financial sector.&#13;
133.  Training within the country and abroad including twinning arrangements would be&#13;
carried out on the basis of IDA approved programs which would identify the nature of training,&#13;
personnel to be trained, the duration of training, institutions where training would be&#13;
conducted, estimated cost of training, etc. Such programs would be submitted to IDA every six&#13;
months for review and clearance.&#13;
134.  Procurement of goods would follow the Bank Guidelines for Procurement (January&#13;
1995 edition). The Project Implementation Manual provides a detailed procurement schedule&#13;
for goods. To the extent possible and practicable, the procurement of goods would be done by&#13;
grouping the various items in bid packages estimated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or more.&#13;
Packages in this category would be required to follow International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures using IDA Standard Bidding Documents. National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
would be undertaken for goods estimated to cost more than US$50,000 but less than&#13;
US$ 100,000 each aggregating not more than US$2.165 million using a standard bidding&#13;
document for goods satisfactory to the IDA. IDA review of the first draft of bid documents for&#13;
NCB is expected to become the standard for future contracts. Goods which cannot be grouped&#13;
in packages valued at US$50,000 or more, national/international shopping procedures would be&#13;
followed aggregating not more than US$875,000.&#13;
135.  IDA review of procurement procedures would be as follows: (a) for consulting&#13;
services, IDA would conduct prior review for all contracts exceeding US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
for individuals and US$100,000 equivalent for firms; (b) for procurement of goods IDA would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
review ex ante contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 or more and the first two NCBs; and&#13;
(c) all other procurement documentation is subject to expost review. This review process&#13;
would result in a prior review of approximately 70 percent of all IDA financed contracts for&#13;
goods. At negotiations, standard processing time for key procurement activities was discussed&#13;
with the borrower and is to be finalized before Board Presentation.&#13;
136.  For procurement monitoring and reporting requirements, each beneficiary would&#13;
nominate a representative to the PCT at MOF. Each beneficiary would have the primary&#13;
responsibility for the procurement and reporting requirements associated with its components.&#13;
On behalf of the beneficiary, this representative on PCT would be responsible for updating&#13;
Procurement Schedules, and preparing reports on related activities to ensure compliance with&#13;
IDA requirements.&#13;

E. Disbursements.&#13;
137.  The Project would be disbursed over a period of four years, from the effectiveness of&#13;
the project, (tentatively July 1, 1996 to June 30, 2000). This is consistent with the standard&#13;
disbursement profile for TA projects in Ghana. Disbursements are expected to occur as&#13;
planned because the implementing agency, MOF, will closely monitor project progress through&#13;
the PCT. A disbursement schedule appears in Table 5.&#13;

138.  To facilitate project implementation a Special Account (SA) will be opened in US&#13;
dollars at a commercial bank, acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocation will amount to&#13;
US$400,000 to cover four months of eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness of the Project,&#13;
an amount of US$200,000, representing 50 percent of the authorized allocation, will be&#13;
deposited in the SA. The remaining balance will be made available when the aggregate&#13;
amount of withdrawals from the Credit Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special&#13;
commitments reached the equivalent of US$5 million. The SA would be used for payments&#13;
below 20 percent of the authorized allocation.&#13;
139.  The SA will be replenished monthly. All replenishment applications are fully&#13;
documented except for contracts for: (a) equipment and consulting services (firms) amounting&#13;
to less than US$ 100,000; and (b) consulting services (individuals) amounting to less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent which may be claimed on the basis of SOE. Expenditures for training&#13;
and studies would be disbursed on the approved programs by IDA.&#13;
F. Accounts and Audits.&#13;
140.  All project accounts, the SA, the Statement of Expenditure and the financial statements&#13;
of the project beneficiaries will be audited at the end of each fiscal year by an independent&#13;
auditor acceptable to the Bank, based on accounting data produced by an outside accounting&#13;
firm. Copies of the audit reports will be forwarded to the Bank within six months of the end of&#13;
each reporting period. The PCT will ensure that the outside firm provides the audits before the&#13;
June 30th deadline. Separate auditors opinion would also be required for project accounts,&#13;
SOE and the SA.&#13;
141.  The PCT at MOF will be responsible for maintaining project accounts and a project&#13;
information system satisfactory to the Bank, which would provide annual accounts as well as&#13;
quarterly updates on disbursements categories and commitments. In order to achieve this,&#13;
MOF would contract out the project accounting to a private firm. In addition, the PCT will&#13;
monitor the Credit and its impact, and will prepare a semi-annual report providing information&#13;
on activities and participation in each of the project areas including capital markets, contractual&#13;
savings industry, associated financial institutions and capacity building.&#13;
142.  To enable the Bank to monitor the progress of project implementation, and to ensure&#13;
conformity to project objectives, the beneficiaries will furnish the Bank and the PCT at MOF&#13;
with semi-annual reports detailing progress of their respective components. These reports&#13;
should continuously evaluate actual implementation progress and actual disbursement against&#13;
planned targets, analyze the reasons for any variances, and alert the PCT and the Bank about&#13;
any changes anticipated in reaching planned targets. In addition, these beneficiaries will&#13;
prepare a Project Completion Report for the entire project six months after the completion of&#13;
disbursements, covering all related activities during project implementation and describing the&#13;
Project's costs and benefits. Formats and schedules regarding procurement, disbursement, and&#13;
auditing and accounting arrangements have been discussed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
G. Terms and Conditions.&#13;
143.  Prior to credit effectiveness, the following will take place: (a) employment of an&#13;
independent accounting firm and an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank;&#13;
(b) employment of a technical advisor within the Project Coordination and Implementation&#13;
Team; (c) adoption of Implementation Manual by the borrower; and (d) subsidiary loan&#13;
agreements to be signed between GOG and the three revenue earning beneficiaries (SIC, GRO&#13;
and HFC) and subsidiary grant agreements with at least three beneficiaries.&#13;

Inflation&#13;
Source: Bank of Ghana&#13;
144.  The table above shows that the currency intensity of the economy (C/M2) recorded a&#13;
steady rise, instead of decline, from 28 percent to 38 percent over the past 5 years. In newly&#13;
industrialized economies like Malaysia and Thailand the ratio of currency to money supply has&#13;
settled below 10 percent. In Ghana, not only is the ratio high but the rate of growth of&#13;
currency in circulation is explosive--4 times in the past 4 years.&#13;
Impact.&#13;
145.  The large volumes of currency with the non-bank public blunts the capabilities of the&#13;
instruments of monetary control. While BOG has been trying to contain inflationary pressures&#13;
by mopping up liquidity through Open Market Operations and hiking up the Bank Rate, M2&#13;
continues to grow due to increase in currency in circulation.&#13;
146.  The economy pays a high cost in terms of printing, distribution, and security measures&#13;
for currency. The Cedi 1 000 and 5000 notes were issued in the past year. Prior to that, printing&#13;
of huge volumes of small denomination notes meant large outgoes of foreign exchange, and it&#13;
still does. The more BOG spends on printing currency, the greater the loss in seigniorage.&#13;
147.  The overwhelming dominance of cash in the economy is seriously constraining&#13;
government's ability to widen the tax base, improve revenue collection, and hence bridge the&#13;
budgetary deficit through efficiency measures on the resources side. When most payments in&#13;
an economy are in cash, it is extremely difficult to estimate incomes and revenues and to trace&#13;
completed transactions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
148.  Financial deepening in the economy has been slow precisely due to the large amounts&#13;
of cash holdings of the public. The Ghana Financial Sector Report estimated that absorption of&#13;
33 percent of non-financial savings into the financial system could lead to a 100 percent&#13;
increase in the growth rate of financial savings.&#13;
149.  The use of cash is risky and inconvenient for end-users. The storage and transit of large&#13;
amounts of cash exposes the normal public to continuous hazards, and bag-snatching incidents&#13;
are reported frequently. Moreover, soiled and mutilated notes often become unusable or non-&#13;
exchangeable, thereby inflicting capital losses on small holders.&#13;
Causes.&#13;
150.  Historical and evolutionary factors are often cited as being the cause of cash dominance&#13;
in the Ghanaian economy, especially the fact that confidence has not been fully restored since&#13;
the early 1 980s when the confidentiality of bank accounts was violated. However, confidence&#13;
would have been quickly restored if the causes mentioned below had been addressed.&#13;
151.  The currency in circulation records a significant jump in the 4th quarter of each year,&#13;
which coincides with the cocoa buying season. While the Cocoa Akuafo Check System&#13;
ensures a good record of disbursal of funds by the produce buying companies, it contains no&#13;
incentives for farmers to leave their funds in the banks. Last season farmers are reported to&#13;
have waited up to 3 weeks to cash their checks, and the situation at bank branches was riotous.&#13;
The banking system has not responded to the specific needs of the cocoa farmers inspite of&#13;
cocoa being the major produce of Ghana. In many places farmers still travel more than 25&#13;
miles to cash cocoa checks. And the chaotic situation prevailing at the time of encashment of&#13;
checks only enhances the cocoa farmers' mistrust and perception of high transaction costs in&#13;
dealing with banks.&#13;
152.  The lack of sufficient infrastructure and high transaction costs are one of the most&#13;
important reasons for large cash holdings among the public. Though on average the population&#13;
served per bank branch in Ghana is 40,000, the distribution of bank branches is relatively&#13;
skewed towards the urban centers. Moreover, the long waits at bank counters for small&#13;
transactions, and long distances to bank branches in upcountry centers, make cash holdings&#13;
more convenient and attractive.&#13;
153.  There is disbursal of government payments in cash. While some of the recurrent&#13;
expenditures such as payroll are reported to be credited to bank accounts, the report of the&#13;
Controller and Accountant General points out that several major Government disbursals&#13;
continue to be made directly from the bank.&#13;
154. Inflationary expectations and lack of real returns on savings in banks contribute to large&#13;
cash holdings. As a matter of fact inflationary expectations are reported to have led to an&#13;
increase in dollarization in the economy. On the other hand, finance companies like Pyram,&#13;
which offered unsustainable returns, have quickly attracted very large deposits, at the risk of&#13;
affecting the trust in the entire financial system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
Institutional Infrastructure.&#13;
155.  Ghana has 15 commercial banks with about 275 branches. There are about 125 rural&#13;
banks, which are single unit operations, with a very small base, essentially functioning as&#13;
community institutions. Of the 275 branches of commercial banks, half belong to the GCB,&#13;
and about 25 percent are located in the Greater Accra region. The efficiency and reach of&#13;
payments services today depends substantially on the efficiency of the GCB.&#13;
156.  GCB has just emerged from a major restructuring, and launched its first&#13;
computerization effort. Moreover, it is slated for early divestiture, which can be expected to&#13;
lead to some consolidation of its branch network. Since the next largest institutions--Social&#13;
Security Bank (SSB), Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), Stanchart and Barclays--have&#13;
branches ranging from 20 to 30 each, no one institution can be said to be in a position to&#13;
spatially cover the whole country as well as have the technological infrastructure to provide&#13;
swift and safe payment services across regions. This will necessarily have to be an inter-&#13;
institutional effort.&#13;
157.  There is no Post Office Savings Bank in Ghana, and the regionwise distribution of post&#13;
offices was not immediately available. However, in case the coverage of bank branches is&#13;
found deficient, the institution of postal giro as a supplementary measure can be considered&#13;
when an iii-depth study of the payment systems is taken up.&#13;

Source: BOG Quarterly Bulletins&#13;
Checks, Clearance and Settlement.&#13;
158.  Table II shows that the daily volume of checks cleared in Ghana has risen at roughly 15&#13;
percent per annum, compared to about 50 percent annual rise in the case of value of checks.&#13;
This clearly indicates that check-writing has not increased in any appreciable measure among&#13;
the common people. On the other hand, the increase in the average value per check written&#13;
clearly demonstrates the predominance of institutional checks and the effect of inflation.&#13;
Unfortunately, checks have major drawbacks as instruments of large-value time-critical funds&#13;
transfers.&#13;
159.  The time taken for local checks to clear in Accra is presently D+3 (3 days in addition&#13;
to date of presentation), and anywhere between 2 to 3 weeks for outstation checks. This&#13;
applies to high as well as small value checks, thereby making the process substantially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
inefficient. Especially in the case of money market and securities market operations, where&#13;
transactions can take place back to back, a 3 day clearance will result either in high credit and&#13;
replacement risks or inability to transact. In the case of intercity checks, the long times for&#13;
clearance may partly be responsible for government's efforts to route its disbursals through the&#13;
treasury branches in cash.&#13;
160.  The work relating to settlement is still manual at the Accra Clearing House, as well as&#13;
the 10 other centers where BOG manages the local clearinghouse. It is important that&#13;
settlement work be computerized as a first step, as later the clearinghouses can be linked by a&#13;
communications network to expedite clearance of intercity checks.&#13;
161.  As yet there is no standardization of the check instrument in Ghana. This makes the&#13;
existing instruments unfit for automated processing, as well as susceptible to fraud and&#13;
forgeries. It is understood that some efforts have been initiated to introduce MICR checks.&#13;
This should be done expeditiously in standardized format, and automated processing&#13;
introduced.&#13;
Risks and Legal Infrastructure.&#13;
162. In Ghana there is not, as yet, a comprehensive unified law governing payment, clearing&#13;
and settlement systems. The rule relating to bouncing of checks provides for a fine not&#13;
exceeding Cedi 500,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both. However, this rule does not seem&#13;
to have improved the confidence in checks due to the difficulty of enforcement through civil&#13;
procedure. In order to encourage the growth of non-cash modes of payment it is important that&#13;
legal enactment exist in two major areas: (a) an integrated law on negotiable instruments&#13;
defining the rights and obligations of payer, payee, collecting bank, paying bank,&#13;
correspondent bank, clearinghouse, central bank; deterrents for fraud and forgeries and their&#13;
simple enforcement; rapid dispute redressal mechanism; and, (b) Enactment on the&#13;
admissibility of electronically stored and transmitted information as evidence in law.&#13;
163.  The rules relating to clearing and settlement are contained in the Bankers Clearing&#13;
House Regulations and Rules. However, this document is substantially incomplete, especially&#13;
in relation to the issue of settlement risks. Settlement risk is the risk that a bank which has an&#13;
adverse clearing on any given day, has insufficient reserves to cover the net deficit and meet&#13;
cash reserve requirements, and is also unable to borrow from the market to cover the liquidity&#13;
gap. The only option then is to reverse that bank's entries. This can lead to the problem of&#13;
some other banks facing liquidity crises as they do not get credit on the checks presented on the&#13;
deficit bank. The only eventuality in which settlement risk is eliminated is when the central&#13;
bank provides temporary overdrafts to cover the net deficit of the member bank. However,&#13;
since this leads to uncontrolled expansion in money supply, it is the least preferred solution.&#13;
164.  The options available for minimizing settlement risk are those gleaned from various&#13;
methods adopted across the world: (a) only major banks with benchmark levels of net worth&#13;
and assets be admitted as members, and the rest seek a correspondent relationship with these&#13;
settlement banks; (b) based on periodic reviews of volumes presented for clearing, each&#13;
member bank be required to maintain collateral with the clearing house equivalent to a certain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
ratio of average daily volumes; (c) settlement lags be reduced to the minimum level possible;&#13;
and (d) liquidity-pooling and loss-sharing arrangements be made among settlement banks (in&#13;
case membership is restricted) so that settlement failure is avoided by decoupling illiquidity&#13;
from insolvency problems.&#13;
Flow of Funds in the Government Sector.&#13;
165.  On the receipts side, payments improvements could leverage substantially greater&#13;
efficiencies in the collection of revenue. In the case of internal revenue the IRS offices in 43&#13;
districts and eight in Accra directly receive cash and checks and then deposit these with GCB&#13;
or Coop Bank, who transfer funds to BOG every third day. This implies avoidable cash and&#13;
check handling by IRS, inconvenience to taxpayers who have to withdraw funds from banks&#13;
and pay-in at IRS, and risk of dishonored checks. In the case of CEPS, the revenue is paid&#13;
directly into the bank (SSB) in most cases. However, due to its extensive operations, CEPS&#13;
finds it extremely difficult to consolidate accounts and collection data. It estimates a US$6&#13;
million computerization effort and use of a communications network to overcome these&#13;
problems.&#13;
166.  On the payments side while some of the recurring payments such as payroll are being&#13;
routed through the banks, substantial payments continue to be made by the 1 10 treasury offices&#13;
throughout the country. This not only entails avoidable cash handling by the treasury but&#13;
results in poor feedback on disbursals thereby seriously limiting cash-flow monitoring at the&#13;
budget office.&#13;
Financial Markets.&#13;
167.  Financial markets are being encouraged to grow in Ghana. However, if the transfer of&#13;
high value funds remains slow, it will act as a constraint on their operations and growth. For&#13;
example, when a discount house accepts a 90 day deposit from a corporate customer, the check&#13;
for the deposit takes 3 days to clear. Who is to bear the loss of income for 3 days? It is&#13;
important that a high-value funds transfer system be put in place to facilitate money market&#13;
transactions.&#13;
168. In the securities markets, government and BOG paper is still exchanged physically for&#13;
securities trades. This inefficient system will have to give way to immobilization followed&#13;
later by dematerialization of scrips, especially if the scrips are listed on the stock exchange as&#13;
proposed. It is understood from market participants that sometimes scrips are not even issued&#13;
by BOG, and the securities are sold and bought by market participants. It was precisely the&#13;
growth of this kind of market practices that led to the "securities scam" in India in 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
Technology &amp; Communications.&#13;
169.  A quick survey of the use of technology in banks in Ghana revealed that almost all&#13;
banks use computers to some extent, though the foreign banks were the most extensive users.&#13;
For example, Social Security Bank has 45 computers installed at 18 of its 38 branches, and 191&#13;
of its 942 employees are computer literate. Barclays has 111 computers installed at 21 of its 28&#13;
branches and 193 of its 708 employees are familiar with computers. This, coupled with the&#13;
fairly extensive computerization plans of BOG, presents an encouraging picture of the&#13;
movement towards better technology use in banking in Ghana.&#13;
170.  While the computerization efforts in the banking sector in Ghana are encouraging, the&#13;
communication infrastructure is severely deficient. The present telecom network, especially&#13;
outside Accra, has very limited capacity. The Bank supported telecom project would increase&#13;
telecom lines by about 50,000 by the end of 1998. While it would mean a step forward, it&#13;
would neither be sufficient nor timely for the needs of the financial sector. If the data&#13;
communications needs of the financial, corporate and public sector are to be met, Ghana will&#13;
need a vertebrate data communications network which can be leveraged for the integration of&#13;
markets and efficiency in information processing throughout the country.&#13;
Organization and Human Resources.&#13;
171.  The relative progress in familiarity with computers among employees in the banking&#13;
sector in Ghana is encouraging. But the understanding of payment systems issues, especially&#13;
their importance in enhancing the efficiency of the financial sector and necessity of risk-&#13;
containment measures, is little understood even among decision-makers. Development&#13;
assistance in this area is necessary, as is the need for a body (committee or council) that can&#13;
address payment systems issues comprehensively. This council, consisting mainly of chief&#13;
executives of banks, BOG, SSNIT, other financial institutions, GSE, IRS, CEPS etc., would&#13;
address a far broader canvass of issues than the Clearing House Committee. It would have&#13;
ownership of technical, legal and operational reforms.&#13;
172. To successfully leverage technology for modernizing the payment systems in Ghana, a&#13;
well thought out program of training in payments and communication software will have to be&#13;
implemented for personnel in the banking and public financial sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
Attachment 2: Privatization Trust&#13;
Introduction.&#13;
173.  A PT is a financial instrument which has been found to be a useful tool to facilitate the&#13;
privatization of public enterprises. It is being used in the privatization program in Zambia and&#13;
is in the course of being implemented in the privatization program in Madagascar. The&#13;
experience with similar divestiture programs in Africa and elsewhere has shown that the sale of&#13;
controlling majorities in public enterprises to strategic investors should be implemented&#13;
expeditiously in order to preserve the viability of the enterprises concerned. On the other hand,&#13;
enough time should be allowed to: (a) avoid straining the limited absorption capacity of&#13;
emerging stock markets through too many new public placements reaching the market at the&#13;
same time; (b) permit the creation of new investment vehicles for collective savings such as&#13;
unit trusts and voluntary pension funds; and (c) address legal and operational issues relating to&#13;
the sale of minority shares to the personnel of the privatized enterprises.&#13;
Role of the PT.&#13;
174.  The PT would be run by a private portfolio manager and controlled by an autonomous&#13;
board of trustees ("the Board of Trustees") which the Government would utilize to&#13;
"warehouse" blocks of minority shares of the public enterprises being divested for a short&#13;
period not to exceed three years. The PT would be managed by a private portfolio&#13;
management company (the "Management Company") under a management contract (the&#13;
"Management Contract") signed with the Government. The minority shareholdings held in the&#13;
PT would be liquidated according to a liquidation plan to be part of the Management Contract&#13;
through sale to: (a) the Ghanaian public through a public offering on GSE; (b) institutional&#13;
investors such as unit trusts, pension funds, insurance companies through private placements;&#13;
and to (c) the personnel of the public enterprises being divested.&#13;
Benefits of using a PT.&#13;
175.  Using a PT in the privatization program would:&#13;
(a)   reconcile the need to keep the period during which a public enterprise is on the&#13;
divestiture list as short as possible while at the same time creating the conditions&#13;
of a broader participation in the privatization program by the public, the local&#13;
securities industry and the company personnel;&#13;
(b)   provide comfort to the purchasers of the controlling majority ("the Strategic&#13;
Investors") of the divested companies to the effect that the Government will not&#13;
use the minority shares to exercise its influence on the management of these&#13;
companies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
(c)   permit an increase in the number of companies listed on the GSE and in the&#13;
daily volume of transactions; and&#13;
(d)   gain time for the broadening of the local securities market, the launching of new&#13;
instruments of contractual saving, the development of local institutional&#13;
investors (unit trusts, insurance companies, pension funds) and for the&#13;
strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework.&#13;
Management Company.&#13;
176. The Management Company would be a professional portfolio manager to be selected&#13;
by the Government for an initial period of two years on the basis of ICB. It would have the&#13;
responsibility of managing the PT in accordance with the Deed of Trust and with the&#13;
Management Contract.&#13;
177. The Management Company would be a Ghanaian company with its principal office in&#13;
Ghana and organized as a licensed bank or non-bank financial institution under Ghanaian law.&#13;
In the performance of its duties, the Management Company could be assisted at its own&#13;
expense by local or international financial experts (firm or individuals) whom it would have&#13;
retained prior to submitting to the public tender. The names, full identity and detailed&#13;
infornation on relevant competence, experience and references of such financial experts would&#13;
be provided in the offer.&#13;
Board of Trustees.&#13;
178.  The Board of Trustees represents the interest of the state as beneficial owner of the&#13;
shares in the PT portfolio. It would be responsible for:&#13;
(a)   supervising the management of the PT by the Management Company and&#13;
ensuring that such Management Company manages the PT portfolio in&#13;
accordance with the Management Contract and the Deed of Trust;&#13;
(b)   approving the annual sales plans;&#13;
(c)   ensuring that the sales prices of the shares to the Authorized Buyers have been&#13;
determined by the Management Company in accordance with the calculation&#13;
formula set forth in the Management Contract; and&#13;
(d)   approving the quarterly and annual financial accounts, management reports and&#13;
auditors' reports.&#13;
179. The Board of Trustees would be composed of five members appointed by the&#13;
Government as follows: (a) a representative from MOF; (b) a representative from DIC; (c) two&#13;
chief executive officers of private sector enterprises; and (d) a financial expert recognized as an&#13;
authority in his field, either professor of finance or partner in a firm of auditors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
Management Contract.&#13;
180.  The Management Contract would be signed between the Government and the&#13;
Management Company for an initial period of two years. It would set out the responsibilities&#13;
of the Management Company, which include:&#13;
(a)   preparing annual sales plans to be submitted to the Board of Trustees for&#13;
approval. The annual sales plans would set forth the program of sales per&#13;
quarter, the shares to be sold, the estimated revenues from the sales and the&#13;
mode of divestment (public offering, private placement and sale to company&#13;
personnel);&#13;
(b)   selling the shares in accordance with the annual sales plan;&#13;
(c)   exercising the rights and responsibilities of shareholders at annual and&#13;
extraordinary shareholders' meetings;&#13;
(d)   exercising the rights and responsibilities of board members when the PT is&#13;
represented on the board of the companies in which it holds shares with the&#13;
objective of protecting and maximizing the value of the PT investment;&#13;
(e)   maximizing the sales price of the shares sold through private placement to&#13;
institutional investors;&#13;
(f)   calculating a sales price for the shares sold to the Ghanaian public and to&#13;
company personnel in accordance with the calculation formula set forth in the&#13;
Management Contract; and&#13;
(g)   holding the financial accounts of the PT and submitting quarterly and annual&#13;
financial accounts and management reports to the Board of Trustees.&#13;
Remuneration of the Management Company.&#13;
181.  The remuneration of the Management Company ("the Management Fee") would consist&#13;
of two parts: a fixed tranche and a variable tranche based on the capital gain achieved in the&#13;
sale of PT shares to institutional investors. The fixed part of the Management Fee would&#13;
consist of a monthly amount to be determined as a result of the international competitive&#13;
process. Although actual amounts will vary depending on the size of the portfolio to be&#13;
managed and the degree of competition among candidates at the time of the bidding, the fixed&#13;
part of the Management Fee might typically be equal to a range of between 1.5 percent and 3&#13;
percent of the value of the PT portfolio. The variable tranche would be equal to 15 percent to&#13;
20 percent of the capital gain on the sale of PT shares through private placements to&#13;
institutional investors.&#13;
182.  The Management Fee would be financed out of the sales proceeds of PT shares sold and&#13;
dividend payments from the PT portfolio. The fixed part of the Management Fee would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
guaranteed by the Government in case such sales proceeds and dividend payments would be&#13;
inadequate to cover the amounts due, which is a situation which might occur during the first&#13;
few months of existence of the PT, when the sale of shares from the PT portfolio has not&#13;
started yet. Back-up financing of the fixed part of the Management Fee up to a maximum&#13;
amount of US$300,000 would be provided to the MOF as a component of the proposed&#13;
assistance project.&#13;
Acquisition of the shares by the PT.&#13;
183.  The PT would receive in trust from the Government minority shares of public enterprise&#13;
being divested only at the time when a Strategic Investor has acquired the controlling majority&#13;
of the shares, in most cases at least 51 percent of the total number of shares issued and&#13;
outstanding. In no case would the PT be allowed under the Management Contract and the&#13;
Deed of Trust to receive shares in companies in which the controlling majority is still held by&#13;
the Government. Under no circumstances should the Management Company be put in the role&#13;
and legal position of exercising the responsibilities of a controlling shareholder.&#13;
Sale of the shares by the PT.&#13;
184.  The Management Contract would provide that the Management Company has the&#13;
obligation to sell any shares received by the PT no later than 3 years after the date of transfer to&#13;
the trust. However, if the conditions of the market are favorable for a sale, the sale could take&#13;
place before the end of a 3 year period, provided such sale has been included in the annual&#13;
sales plan approved by the Board of Trustees. On the basis of the accelerated divestiture&#13;
program being implemented over a period not exceeding three years, the PT should have a&#13;
maximum duration of 6 years. The PT would be liquidated after all the shares which it&#13;
acquired are sold, or at the end of the sixth anniversary of the creation of the trust at the latest.&#13;
185.  The Management Company would be obligated to sell the shares held in the PT&#13;
portfolio to the following categories of buyers ("the Authorized Buyers"):&#13;
(a)   the personnel of the company of which the shares are sold, up to an amount not&#13;
exceeding 15 percent of the total number of shares issued and outstanding;&#13;
(b)   the Ghanaian public through public placements; and&#13;
(c)   institutional investors regularly licensed under the Banking Law, the Securities&#13;
Industry Law or the Financial Institutions (Non-Banking) Law of 1993, through&#13;
private placements.&#13;
186.  Although the final percentage of allocation of the PT among the Authorized Buyers&#13;
might vary and should be determined in the laws and decrees governing the government&#13;
divestiture program, a typical allocation would be as follows: (a) 10 to 15 percent to the&#13;
company personnel; (b) 25 to 30 percent to the Ghanaian public, and (c) 10 to 15 percent to&#13;
institutional investors. This typical allocation is based on the assumption that the minority&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
shares held by the PT represent approximately 49 percent of the total outstanding shares of the&#13;
companies concerned. Actual allocation might be different if more or less than 51 percent of&#13;
the outstanding shares has been sold to the Strategic Investor.&#13;
Sale to company personnel.&#13;
187.  The sales price to the company personnel would be equal to the product of: (a) 80&#13;
percent of the sale price to the Strategic Investor; and (b) a coefficient reflecting the increase in&#13;
the cost of living index from the date of the sale to the Strategic Investor to the date of the sale&#13;
to the company personnel.&#13;
188.  Any employee who has worked for at least 12 months in the enterprise would be&#13;
eligible for the purchase of company shares. The maximum number of shares which could be&#13;
purchased by any single employee should be such that the total purchase price of these shares&#13;
does not exceed 20 percent of his annual gross salary. The employee would have the&#13;
possibility to purchase the shares on credit, without interest, over a 24 month period. Payment&#13;
of the price would be made in 24 equal monthly installments to be withheld on his salary at the&#13;
end of each month. Delivery of the shares would take place only after full payment of the sales&#13;
price.&#13;
Sale of shares to the Ghanaian public.&#13;
189.  All Ghanaian citizens would be eligible to purchase a fixed number of shares (a typical&#13;
number would be 10 shares) on a cash basis at a price equal to the product of: (a) 80 percent of&#13;
the sale price to the Strategic Investor; (b) a coefficient reflecting the increase in the cost of&#13;
living index from the date of the sale to the Strategic Investor to the date of the public&#13;
placement; and (c) a coefficient reflecting any increase in the value of the shares over and&#13;
above the increase in the cost of living index as determined by an update to be performed by&#13;
independent auditors of the valuation report initially made for the sale to the Strategic Investor.&#13;
Financial control of the PT.&#13;
190.  The Management Company would be obligated to produce and submit the following&#13;
reports to the Board of Trustees for approval:&#13;
(a)   annual sales plan, including the program of sales per quarter, the shares to be&#13;
sold, the price at which such shares would be sold, the estimated proceeds from&#13;
the sale and the categories of Authorized Buyers to which the sales would be&#13;
made;&#13;
(b)   quarterly financial accounts of the PT including detailed information on the&#13;
shares acquired and sold by the PT, the funds received as proceeds from sales&#13;
and dividend payment and paid to the Treasury and on the shares held in the PT&#13;
portfolio at the beginning and at the end of the period;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
(c)   annual financial accounts of the PT providing the same information as the&#13;
quarterly accounts but on an annual basis; and&#13;
(d)   quarterly and annual management reports of activities providing comments on&#13;
the transactions completed and the major events which have affected the value&#13;
of the PT portfolio during the period.&#13;
191.  As attachment to the quarterly and annual management reports, the Management&#13;
Company would submit to the Board of Trustees for review and approval quarterly and annual&#13;
auditors' reports on the quarterly and annual financial accounts of the PT and the Management&#13;
Company by independent auditors. Such independent auditors would be appointed by the&#13;
Board of Trustees.&#13;

            Ghana - Non-Bank Financial Institutions
            Assistance Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Non-Bank Financial Institutions
            Assistance Credit Project has two objectives.  The first is
            to promote the growth of an efficient, competitive, well
            regulated, non-bank financial sector and an efficient
            payments system in order to: 1) increase the mobilization of
            domestic savings in both formal and informal sectors; 2)
            facilitate the flow of international capital into Ghana
            through better financial intermediation; and 3) supply
            financial services competitively to the economy.  The second
            objective is to create an environment conducive to greater
            private sector activity and support the successful
            implementation of the divestiture program for state owned
            enterprises (SOE) and the three largest state-owned
            commercial banks.  The project addresses identified gaps in
            the non-bank financial sector including: capital markets
            institutions such as the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE),
            Securities Regulatory Commission (SRC), and the Bank of
            Ghana (BOG), and contractual savings institutions, such as
            National Insurance Commission (NIC), State Insurance
            Corporation (SIC), Ghana Reinsurance Organization (GRO), and
            Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT).  The
            project also provides for associated financial
            infrastructure (domestic payments system) and capacity
            building in the non-bank financial institutions sector and
            diagnostic studies at the Ministry of Finance to enable the
            Government of Ghana to prepare strategies for future actions
            in expanding the provision of financial services to rural
            and informal sectors.
