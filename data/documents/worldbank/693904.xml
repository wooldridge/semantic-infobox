TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
I.    This Technical Annex accompanies the Memorandum of the President for a proposed El&#13;
Ninio Emergency Assistance Loan to Peru. The proposed Project will support the Government's&#13;
on-going efforts to mitigate the potentially severe impact of the 1997-98 El Nifo event. In the&#13;
event of such an occurrence, the Loan will support reconstruction and other restoration activities.&#13;
BACKGROUND TO THE "EL NIMO" EVENT&#13;
2.    The El Niho Phenomenon. Local fishermen along the coasts of Peru and Ecuador have&#13;
observed for decades the periodic appearance of a warm ocean current that would extend&#13;
southward along the west coast of South America. As it occurred around Christmas they termed&#13;
this current "El Nifio", or Spanish for the Christ child. Over the years, the term "El Nifio" has&#13;
come to be reserved for these exceptionally strong warm intervals that have disrupted the local&#13;
fishing industry and have brought heavy rains and flooding to this coastal region. It has also been&#13;
increasingly recognized as a phenomenon which has an impact throughout the world, bringing&#13;
drought to South-East Asia, Southern Africa and North-Eastern Brazil while bringing heavy&#13;
rainfall to the normally arid coastline of the Americas.&#13;
3.    In the scientific community, El Nino is more formally known as the El Niflo-Southern&#13;
Oscillation (ENSO), as climate scientists now link the advent of these warm ocean currents to a&#13;
related atmospheric event called the "Southern Oscillation". The ENSO then is described as a&#13;
disruption of the ocean atmosphere system in the tropical Pacific, during which trade winds relax&#13;
in the western Pacific, with a resulting rise in sea surface temperature and a drastic decline in the&#13;
primary productivity of the food chain, which affects commercial fisheries in the region. Rainfall&#13;
follows the warm water eastward, with associated flooding in Peru and drought in Indonesia and&#13;
Australia. The eastward displacement of the atmospheric heat source overlaying the warmest&#13;
water results in large changes in the global atmospheric circulation, which in turn forces changes&#13;
in weather in regions far removed from the tropical Pacific. There is now a growing body of&#13;
evidence suggesting that this ENSO phenomenon contributes to, or is responsible for, anomalous&#13;
weather patterns throughout the world, sometimes of disastrous proportions.&#13;
4.    The El Nifno phenomenon occurs every few years, though not on a predictable cycle and&#13;
with varying magnitude and impact. Observations of conditions in the tropical Pacific are&#13;
considered essential for the prediction of the short term (a few months to one year) climate&#13;
variations. To provide the necessary data, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency&#13;
(NOAA) operates a network of buoys which measure temperatures, currents and winds in the&#13;
equatorial bands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.    During the last century more than a dozen El Nifio events have affected the South&#13;
American Coast (See Table 1). Most of them raised water temperatures not only along the coast&#13;
but in a belt stretching 5000 miles across the Equatorial Pacific. The weaker events raised sea&#13;
temperatures only 1-1 1/2°C and had only minor impacts on the fisheries; the stronger events, like&#13;
the El Nifio of 1982/83, raised temperatures 5-10°C and had a major impact not only on the local&#13;
weather and marine life but also, it is believed, on climatic conditions around the globe.&#13;

6.    Compared to the 1982-83 episode, the 1997 El Nin'o has accelerated rapidly to a level (of&#13;
sea surface temperatures) already as high as those reached at the peak of the 1982-83 cycle. A&#13;
comparison of sea surface temperatures in the months leading to the 1972-73, 1982-83 and the&#13;
1997-98 El Nifio events is shown in the chart accompanying the Memorandum of the President&#13;
for this operation. Based on the behavior to date and statistical correlations with trends in the&#13;
past, it can be predicted with a high degree of confidence that the phenomenon will persist well&#13;
into the first half of 1998 and lead to significant economic and social dislocation. A recent&#13;
Climate Outlook Forum convened on October 28, 1997 in Lima, Peru reaffrmed that the El Nifho&#13;
event was expected to remain strong over the forecast period of December 1997-March 1998.&#13;
The Forum was comprised of representatives of Meteorological Services and climate researchers&#13;
from universities and international research institutes. A statement issued by the Forum is&#13;
available in the Project files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7.    The Impact of the 1982-83 El Nifio. The 1982-83 El Nifno has been the strongest such&#13;
event of this century with devastating impact on many countries of the world, with widespread&#13;
incidents of drought, flooding and severe storms in 5 continents, and economic losses estimated&#13;
by some to be in excess of US$14 billion. The Western countries of Latin America, in particular,&#13;
were most severely affected as the 1982-83 El Niflo event is estimated to have led to up to 100&#13;
inches of rain over six months in the coastal desert regions of Northern Peru and Ecuador, and&#13;
severe drought in the Andean highlands with an estimated US$2 billion in direct and indirect&#13;
losses to fisheries, agriculture, transportation, housing, and other sectors of the economy. In&#13;
Peru, the Government has estimated direct losses of up to US$ 1 billion, with subsequent&#13;
estimates of reconstruction efforts over several years costing almost as much additionally. The&#13;
IMF estimates of the El Niiio impact on the Peruvian economy accounted for half of the 12&#13;
percent decline in the GDP observed in 1982.&#13;
8.    The social impact of the 1982-83 El Nifio was also severe in Peru. Over 200 lives were&#13;
lost and there was significant social dislocation caused by the immediate needs to deal with floods&#13;
and droughts, incidences of breakout of disease with damage to potable water and sanitation&#13;
facilities. The change in temperature patterns typical of the El Niio event disrupted fishing as&#13;
some fish migrated southward towards Chile or withdrew deeper into the ocean, crop cycles were&#13;
disrupted because of an increase in temperatures, and key economic and social infrastructure&#13;
services of electricity, roads, telephones, schools, hospitals and housing suffered damage'. In the&#13;
Andean highlands in the south (Altiplano hereafter) , the drought conditions led to shortages of&#13;
food for humans and shortages of forage for livestock. This led to a large-scale slaughter of cattle&#13;
for meat leading to cattle shortages in later years2. In the southern department of Puno, for&#13;
example, the Ministry of Agriculture estimates that crop production fell by 70%, while livestock&#13;
sales increased by 25% in the 1982-83 episode, as people were forced to sell or decimate&#13;
livestock due to the lack of forage and shortage of food for human consumption. The decimation&#13;
of livestock herds, the lack of food in local markets and a shortage of seeds for the next year's&#13;
crop impacted the local economy for several subsequent years and also contributed to a mass&#13;
migration from rural communities to urban centers in search of employment.&#13;
9.    The 1997-98 El Nin'o. The return of El Nifno was first detected in the Eastern Pacific in&#13;
May of this year. By July, it was clear that the phenomenon was as intense as that of 1982-83.&#13;
Off the coast of Peru, the sea-surface temperature rose sharply in the period, March-June 1997.&#13;
Compared to the 1982-83 episode, the one that began in 1997-98 has already accelerated rapidly&#13;
to a level (of sea surface temperatures) as high as reached at the peak of 1982-83 cycle.&#13;
Although these temperature anomalies started earlier than in 1982-83, they could, if sustained&#13;
through the summer months of the Southern Hemisphere (December-April), give rise to rainfall&#13;
on a scale experienced in 1982-83. IBRD Map No.29186 accompanying the Memorandum of the&#13;
President to this operation shows the sea temperature anomalies observed off the coast of Peru in&#13;
September 1997. It is for this reason that the Peruvian government declared a state of emergency&#13;
In 1982-83, for example, 620 kilometers of roads, including 350 km. of the Pan American highway, the main&#13;
artery of the country, were out of service due to heavy rains; 47 bridges and 4 airports were also damaged, as&#13;
was 600 km. of the electricity distribution system. Additionally, 101 health centers and 875 educational&#13;
institutions suffered damage leading to prolonged loss of livelihoods and social services.&#13;
2 It is estimated that 2.6 million heads of livestock were lost in the course of the 1982-83 El Niflo event.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
in June 1997 to enable it take, sufficiently in advance, the needed preventive steps to mitigate the&#13;
adverse socio-economic impact on the most vulnerable region of the country.&#13;
10.   Reliability of Forecasts. The gross features of the El Ninio events, and some of its&#13;
climate impacts, can be predicted in advance by ocean-atmosphere models. However, the&#13;
predictive capability of these models is still limited by an insufficient understanding of the intrinsic&#13;
mechanism responsible for these events. In general, forecasts of shorter lead time i.e. three&#13;
months, have shown themselves to be more reliable. Forecasts are currently showing that&#13;
temperature anomalies off the Northern Peruvian coast will continue at least until March 1998.&#13;
As a result, it is reasonable to suppose, particularly in the northernmost reaches of the coastal&#13;
plain (Tumbes and Piura), that the rainfall pattern may be similar to that in 1982-83. The duration&#13;
of the rainfall from this 1997-98 El Niflo event, however, may eventually be less than in 1982-83&#13;
(when it continued for over 6 months until June/July) since the 1997-98 El Nifno formed earlier.&#13;
11.   Though there remains an element of uncertainty in the intensity of the El Nifno events,&#13;
there is, nevertheless, considerable consensus that vulnerable regions such as Northern Peru&#13;
should take the essential preventive measures to mitigate the impact of any flooding caused by a&#13;
likelihood of a sustained period of heavy rainfall, as occurred in 1982-83, and which some still&#13;
think could be exceeded by the 1997-98 El Niflo event. Equally, the Altiplano regions in southern&#13;
Peru should begin to rehabilitate water management facilities and put in place contingent&#13;
strategies to deal with drought mitigation measures. Such preventive measures are particularly&#13;
important in Peru, as the departments that are the most vulnerable to the extreme weather&#13;
patterns brought about by El Nifno also contain some of the highest percentages of economically&#13;
vulnerable groups. The Altiplano in particular is one of the poorest regions in the entire Latin&#13;
America and the majority of the population has little economic security to withstand the effects of&#13;
any incidence of loss of crops or other livelihood caused by drought. The poorer population&#13;
groups in the Northern Coastal area also have very simple dwellings whose construction materials&#13;
have little ability to withstand torrential rains as are being forecast. Table 2 shows the incidence&#13;
of poverty in some of the departments of the country which are expected to be the most&#13;
vulnerable to extreme weather patterns due to El Nifio.&#13;

12.    The Government's Strategy for Dealing with the 1997-98 El Nifio. Given the current&#13;
scenarios of the potential impact of the 1997-98 El Niiio event, the Government of Peru is taking&#13;
decisive steps to mitigate the impact of a potential emergency situation. On June 19, 1997 a state&#13;
of emergency was declared in 9 of the country's 24 departments, a number which has&#13;
subsequently increased to 14. These departments are: in the North - Tumbes, Piura, Cajamarca,&#13;
Lambayeque, La Libertad y Ancash; and in the South - Arequipa, Moquegua, Tacna, Puno,&#13;
Ayacucho, Apurimac, Huancavelica and Cusco. IBRD Map No. 29188 accompanying the&#13;
Memorandum of the President illustrates the departments in which the Government has declared a&#13;
state of El Nifio emergency.&#13;
13.   A key element of the Government's strategy is a strong emphasis on preventive actions to&#13;
mitigate the loss of human life and damage to infrastructure.&#13;
(a)    As part of this prevention strategy, the Government has already begun the&#13;
rehabilitation and strengthening of key infrastructure facilities in the flood-prone&#13;
North - dredging riverbeds, strengthening river defenses, cleaning/constructing&#13;
storm drainage, strengthening bridges, and the constructing of temporaly housing&#13;
in elevated locations. In the drought-prone Altiplano (high plains), the&#13;
Government is rehabilitating and strengthening water management infrastructure&#13;
and taking steps to ensure the production and distribution of forage and seeds to&#13;
minimize the impact of potential drought conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
(b)   The subsequent rliedf phase, to be implemented largely by the National Institute of&#13;
Civil Defense (INDECI), is expected to consist of standard disaster response&#13;
activities in the immediate aftermath (90-100 days) of the disaster being declared.&#13;
This is likely to include evacuation, temporary, and in some cases permanent,&#13;
resettlement of households from flood affected areas, and the distribution of food,&#13;
medicines and other essentials.&#13;
(c)   Finally, the reconstruction phase, to be coordinated through the Ministry of&#13;
Economy and Finance, is expected to last two to three years and would be focused&#13;
on reconstruction of economic and social infrastructure.&#13;
14.   The Bank's Response. The Government requested Bank financial support for emergency&#13;
activities just prior to the Annual Meetings and the Bank fielded a mission almost immediately to&#13;
assess the Government's program and modalities of Bank support. This mission, and its&#13;
subsequent follow-up, assisted the Government in refocusing the design of a program of&#13;
prevention activities, in defining the eligibility criteria and the project management arrangements&#13;
for the subsequent reconstruction phase, and an institutional strengthening component. A similar&#13;
request for financing was made to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) with whom close&#13;
coordination has been maintained throughout the preparation of the Emergency Assistance&#13;
project.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
15.   Project Objectives. The principal objectives of the proposed project would be to:&#13;
(a)   Help reduce the loss of human life and a deterioration of living standards that&#13;
might result from the floods and/or droughts caused by the 1997/98 El Niio event.&#13;
(b)   Help reduce the loss of, or damage to, economic and social infrastructure that&#13;
might result from similar events.&#13;
(c)   Help increase Peru's capacity to forecast and respond to future El Nino&#13;
phenomena.&#13;
16.   Project Design Alternatives Considered. An unusual feature of this particular&#13;
emergency operation is that, even though a potential emergency situation has been forecast with a&#13;
high degree of probability, its severity and scope are not yet known at the time of project design&#13;
and approval. Given this uncertainty, and at the same time, the immediate need for funding&#13;
preventive activities, the project team considered several design options.&#13;
(a)   Restructuring a part of the existing portfolio to include the needed prevention&#13;
works. In subsequent consultation with the Government, it was decided not to&#13;
restructure project operations in the existing portfolio as the diversion of funds of&#13;
the proposed magnitude from their originally designated uses was likely to put at&#13;
risk the basic development objectives of these operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
(b)   Processing a new operation only for the preventive phase, while preparing another&#13;
project for the reconstruction phase to be approved once the effects of the El Nifno&#13;
event became clearer. The option of a two-operation approach was also dropped&#13;
as it was realized that given the uncertain nature and timing of the El Ninlo's&#13;
impact, it was important for the Government to have access to adequate financial&#13;
resources to ensure timely response to both immediate and/or evolving emergency&#13;
disaster situations. The Government gave considerable importance to these two&#13;
considerations.&#13;
(c)   On a more technical level, a strategic design choice was made for the drought&#13;
prevention program. The original project design called for livestock management&#13;
through culling of camelid herds and transportation of bovine and ovine livestock&#13;
from drought prone areas to less vulnerable areas. In consultation with the Food&#13;
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de&#13;
Maizy Trigo (CMIMYT) and the World Bank, the Government has now decided&#13;
to focus its drought prevention efforts on ensuring availability of some water, and&#13;
minimal production of forage and seeds to ensure maintenance of livestock herds&#13;
and the availability of seeds for the next crop.&#13;
17.   Description. Given the nature of the El Nino event, the proposed operation is designed&#13;
to be implemented in three distinct phases: (a) a prevention phase of about six months (July-&#13;
December 1997), in which project activities are now well defined; (b) an emergency phase in&#13;
which the Bank will provide limited support, and (c) a reconstruction phase, estimated to require&#13;
two to three years, whose scope and content cannot yet be defined prior to the emergency&#13;
occurring, but for which eligibility criteria have been drawn up and agreed to. In addition, the&#13;
project includes an institutional strengthening component.&#13;
(a)   The prevention component consists of two sub-components:&#13;
(i)   Flood-protection measures in northern coastal Peru, including river&#13;
dredging, strengthening of river defenses, cleaning/construction of storm&#13;
drainage canals in urban and rural areas, bridge strengthening, construction&#13;
of temporary housing, and protection of archeological sites.&#13;
(ii)    Drought-mitigation measures in southern Peru's Altiplano, including water&#13;
management measures such as rehabilitation of wells, pumps, and small&#13;
irrigation systems, production of forage to mitigate the effects of a drought&#13;
on livestock and a seed production program to ensure the availability of&#13;
seeds for the next planting season.&#13;
(b)   In the emergency phase, the Bank will provide limited support, largely for the&#13;
provision of certain emergency equipment such as mobile bridge structures, mobile&#13;
power plants and water tanks, pumps and metallic protection structures needed&#13;
urgently during the flood disaster.&#13;
(c)   The reconstruction phase. Given that the full impact of the El Nino will only be&#13;
ascertained in the first few months of 1998, it is not possible to define this phase&#13;
completely at this time. The eligibility of financing for any reconstruction activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8-&#13;
would thus be contingent on damages sustained due to El Nifio related&#13;
phenomena. It is likely to consist of the following three sub-components:&#13;
(i)    Rehabilitation and reconstruction of key public infrastructure such as a)&#13;
hospitals, health posts, schools; (b) roads and bridges; (c) irrigation and&#13;
drainage systems; (d) water supply and electricity; and (e) river training,&#13;
defenses and embankments. Investment sub-projects to be financed under&#13;
the reconstruction phase would have to meet eligibility criteria agreed upon&#13;
with the Government (paragraph 21).&#13;
(ii)    Resettlement of families in flood prone areas This sub-component will&#13;
support the provision of infrastructure facilities and public services for the&#13;
permanent relocation of about 6,000 families identified to be living in areas&#13;
that are recurrently flood prone and/or whose relocation is considered&#13;
essential to carrying out the Government's emergency preparedness efforts.&#13;
(iii)   Labor-intensive rural public works program. A labor-intensive rural public&#13;
works program aimed at providing a safety net to vulnerable groups&#13;
affected by the drought, who might otherwise migrate out of the Andean&#13;
highlands to the coastal areas in search of employment. These works&#13;
would also strengthen sustainable agricultural capacity of drought-prone&#13;
areas in the long run.&#13;
(d)   Institutional support This sub-component will finance:&#13;
(i)   Specialized expertise, training and equipment to a range of Peruvian&#13;
institutions responsible for collecting information, and predicting,&#13;
monitoring and mitigating the effects of future El Nino events.&#13;
(ii)    The preparation of a comprehensive government strategy for disaster&#13;
forecasting and management.&#13;
(iii)   Technical assistance, to the Office of Investments in the Ministry of&#13;
Economy and Finance to enable it to carry out project implementation&#13;
effectively, including necessary support for the planning and&#13;
implementation of the resettlement activities.&#13;
A.   The Emergency Prevention Component (approx. US$ 100 million)&#13;
18.   Flood Control Component (approx. US$ 90 million). This component will finance&#13;
measures in northern coastal Peru to undertake rehabilitation and maintenance works to minimize&#13;
damage to people and property by keeping flood water away from the flood prone areas. The&#13;
design of this component is based on the premise that the water flow due to the likely heavy&#13;
rainfall associated with El Ninio will be significantly higher than normal and may well lead to water&#13;
flow patterns different from the "normal behavior" of rivers and streams the potentially&#13;
devastating impact of which may require actions beyond routine maintenance works. The works&#13;
to be financed through this component include river dredging, strengthening of river defenses,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
cleaning/construction of storm drainage canals in urban and rural areas, bridge strengthening,&#13;
construction of temporary housing, and protection of archeological sites. Appendix 1 provides a&#13;
list of these preventive flood control works being undertaken in the Northern coastal area.&#13;
19.   The flood control system against the impact of the 1997-98 El Niflo includes two main&#13;
sub-components: (i) controlling water encroachment from outside the protected areas through&#13;
overflowing rivers, drainage canals and runoffs from upland areas, and (ii) controlling the surplus&#13;
water accumulating within the protected areas due to heavy rainfall or due to the water coming&#13;
from external sources.&#13;
20. Controlling Waters Originating from Outside the Flood Prone Areas. In the northern&#13;
region, there are likely to be three major external sources of water coming into the region: rivers&#13;
(including ravines), flooded drainage canals and runoff from upland areas. River banks and&#13;
drainage channel flooding occur because rivers and channels have insufficient carrying capacity to&#13;
handle the high flows. Thus, the preventive works in this area have been designed to increase the&#13;
flood carrying capacity of the water courses by dredging river beds (Piura and Tumbes rivers);&#13;
the upgrading of the levees and riverbanks (Motupe, Olmos, Chancay, Cascajal, Moche, Viru y&#13;
Lacramarca and other rivers and ravines ); construction of cutoff channels (La Leche and Zana&#13;
rivers); placing facing against slopes in the ravines and drains to strengthen them and to prevent&#13;
scour and erosion (typically rip-rap protection, "gavione" mattresses, poly-ethylene sand-cement&#13;
sacks; and the clearing of the obstructions in the water courses (including the cleaning and&#13;
reinforcing capacity of the culverts, ditches, and bridges of the roads system). Special&#13;
consideration is being given to bridges and culverts which can cause abrupt constriction of&#13;
streams and at the same time constitute obstacles in the path of the flood. Runoff from upland&#13;
areas is being handled by interceptor channels coupled with small levees.&#13;
21.   Control of Waters Originatingfrom Within the Flood Prone Areas. The design of the&#13;
flood control system in the Northern area also takes into account the role of heavy rainfalls in the&#13;
development of flood conditions. In this case, the flood protection measures being undertaken&#13;
include improvement to the rain-storm drainage systems in the urban and rural areas, installation&#13;
of pumping facilities to evacuate the accumulated water quickly, cleaning and strengthening of&#13;
sewage systems, the protection of public buildings ( archeological places, health posts, hospitals&#13;
and schools), and transport facilities (airports and ports). Although the planning authorities have&#13;
given first priority to these measures to control water accumulation within the protected areas, the&#13;
effectiveness of these measures will depend critically on the effectiveness of the measures&#13;
described above to additionally control water coming into the area from rivers, drainage canals&#13;
and runoffs.&#13;
22.   Drought Mitigation Measures (approx. US$ 10 million). The Government's&#13;
emergency program for drought areas covers seven departments, namely, Apurimac, Arequipa,&#13;
Ayacucho, Cusco, Moquegua, Puno, and Tacna. Most of the activities proposed in this&#13;
component will be focused on the department of Puno, which is expected to be the hardest hit&#13;
department. The principal activity is livestock production, the main products being milk, meat,&#13;
and wool (both sheep and alpaca). Pasture production is mainly in rainfed areas, and is based on&#13;
low yielding native pasture. Crop production is almost entirely at subsistence levels and is&#13;
characterized by extremely low productivity levels (yields/hectare). These areas are dominated by&#13;
minifundio and low levels of productivity. Farms are segmented and highly dispersed, availability&#13;
of working capital is scarce and this has been one of the principal factors why irrigation schemes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
have not prospered. It is also a principal reason why the farming community cannot develop&#13;
preventive measures to combat the expected drought due to the El Ninlo phenomenon, and&#13;
significant preventive rehabilitation needs to be undertaken.&#13;
23.   Rehabilitation of Existing Water and ImWgation Systems. As a drought prevention&#13;
measure in the Sierra Sur, it is necessary to ensure that existing water resources are operative for&#13;
human, animal consumption and where possible for small irrigation systems.&#13;
(a)   Rehabilitation of deep tubular wells. This component will support the&#13;
rehabilitation of tubular wells that are currently not functioning to enable them to&#13;
be used for irrigation in small areas. Of the 100 existing wells in Puno, for&#13;
example, only 25 are now operational and the other 75 need to be rehabilitated at&#13;
an estimated unit cost of US$14,000. Activities to be financed include cleaning of&#13;
the existing wells, repairs and replacement of pumps, and tests for pump capacity&#13;
and quality of water. The rehabilitation of these wells will be carried out by the&#13;
lnstituto Nacional de Recursos Naturales (INRENA) and the Programa de Aguas&#13;
Subterrineasy Tecnificaci6n de Riesgo (PRASTER), which are local agencies,&#13;
currently working on drought prevention measures in Puno in collaboration with&#13;
the Comites de Regantes of each of the wells under repair. It is estimated that this&#13;
component will benefit 1,370 families and provide potential irrigation for 2,300&#13;
hectares of land.&#13;
(b)   Rehabilitation of Small Wells. This sub-component will finance the rehabilitation&#13;
of a series of shallow wells in Puno that can be used to provide water for human&#13;
and animal consumption. This sub-component will rehabilitate the existing 3500&#13;
wells and install 3500 manual pumps throughout the department of Puno. It is&#13;
estimated that the cost of rehabilitating and installing each pump will be US$225.&#13;
The work is being carried out by the Direcci6n Regional del Ministerio de&#13;
Agricultura.&#13;
(c)   Rehabilitation of Existing Irrigation Infrastructure. This sub-component will&#13;
finance the rehabilitation of 94 existing irrigation systems across 7 departments&#13;
that are currently not fully operational for reasons of incomplete works and lack of&#13;
maintenance. PRONAMACH has already started on the rehabilitation of a number&#13;
of these irrigation schemes throughout the Sierra Sur as part of its drought&#13;
prevention work. The sub-component is expected to benefit 8,163 families and&#13;
provide irrigation to 6,215 hectares.&#13;
24.   Forage Production Program. This component will support a program of forage&#13;
production in the irrigated areas of Puno, to guard against a repeat of the 1982-83 experience of&#13;
the forced sale of livestock and the slow recuperation of the herd, because of the lack of forage.&#13;
The program is run by the Ministry of Agriculture, coordinated in the field by the Instituto&#13;
Nacional de Investigaci6n Agropecuaria (INIA) and implemented by various government&#13;
agencies in collaboration with farmers in the existing irrigation schemes. The strategy being&#13;
implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture is to sow annual forage crops such as barley and oats&#13;
along with a small amount of perennial pastures. The agreement between the Ministry and the&#13;
farmers stipulates that the harvest will be divided in equal parts between the parties. It is estimated&#13;
that under irrigation yields of green forage can reach 30 tons/hectare. The total projected harvest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
is calculated to provide forage for the equivalent of 50,000 cattle or 300,000 sheep, or 200,000&#13;
camelids for a period of seven months which are estimated to be periods of severe shortages of&#13;
forage in the case of a drought. It is estimated that sowing should be completed by December 31,&#13;
1997.&#13;
25. Seed Production Program. One of the ingredients in hastening recovery from a drought&#13;
is the need to ensure an ample supply of good quality seed for the subsequent sowing season.&#13;
This sub-component will finance the implementation of such a measure with a seed production&#13;
program consisting of crops that provide the basic foods and forage for the area, namely,&#13;
potatoes, quinua, canihua, barley, oats, faba beans and tarwi. This program would be&#13;
implemented by INIA, and the Universidad Nacional Agraria (UNA) which have as a main part&#13;
of their research strategy to provide seed for the basic food crops of Peru. Sowing will start&#13;
immediately in October 1997. It is proposed to finance the sowing of 2,660 hectares, all under&#13;
irrigation, with a total seed production of 20,157 tons at an estimated cost of US$2.73 million.&#13;
B. Emergency Operations.&#13;
26.   The emergency phase is expected to consist of standard disaster response activities in the&#13;
immediate aftermath (90-100 days) of the disaster being declared. This is likely to include&#13;
evacuation, temporary, and in some cases permanent, resettlement of households from flood&#13;
affected areas, and the distribution of food, medicines and other essentials. The Bank's&#13;
involvement in this phase will be limited. It is likely to be implemented through the National&#13;
Institute of Civil Defence with assistance from other agencies and NGOs with a comparative&#13;
advantage in such activities. The Bank may, however, provide limited support, largely for the&#13;
provision of certain emergency equipment such as mobile bridge structures, mobile power plants&#13;
and water tanks, pumps and metallic protection structures needed urgently during the flood&#13;
disaster.&#13;
C. Reconstruction Phase. ( in the order of US$330 million).&#13;
27.   Given that the full impact of the El Nino will only be ascertained in the first few months of&#13;
1998, it is not possible to define completely up-front this component. It is, however, likely to&#13;
consist of the following three components.&#13;
28.   Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of Economic and Social Infrastructure. While the&#13;
specific activities to be included in this phase cannot be identified up-front, the following types of&#13;
infrastructure services will be eligible:&#13;
(a)   hospitals, health posts, schools;&#13;
(b)   roads (primary, secondary and rural), bridges and the urban street system;&#13;
(c)   irrigation and drainage systems;&#13;
(d)   water supply and electricity; and&#13;
(e)   river defenses, river training construction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
29.   The specific works to be financed under the reconstruction phase cannot be defined until&#13;
the full extent of any damages resulting from excessive rainfall in the coastal region and/or the&#13;
drought in the Altiplano are known. This will not be feasible until the beginning of 1998 at the&#13;
earliest. As a consequence, the works to be financed under the reconstruction phase must meet&#13;
the following eligibility criteria:&#13;
(a)   they must be located in the officially declared emergency regions;&#13;
(b)   prior existence before the El Ninio event;&#13;
(c)   they must form an integral part of the emergency operation;&#13;
(d)   demonstration of clear cause and effect relationship between the El Nifno events&#13;
and the damage;&#13;
(e)   acceptable technical, economic and environmental rationale for rehabilitation;&#13;
(f)   the existence of an appropriate and capable agency to execute the work;&#13;
(g)   involvement of the direct beneficiaries and stakeholders in the identification and&#13;
design of the sub-project; and&#13;
(h)   to the extent possible, the integration of labor intensive technologies in sub-project&#13;
design and execution.&#13;
30.   Though these works to be financed will not be known with certainty until early 1998, all&#13;
rehabilitation works for financing under the Bank project, must be presented to the Bank within&#13;
one year of the effectiveness date of the project.&#13;
31.   Resettlement of Families at Risk in the Flood Prone Areas (approx. US$ 28 milion).&#13;
El Ninlo is expected to cause heavy rains resulting in flooding of towns and cities in the north&#13;
coast of Peru, causing landslides in sloping terrains and inundation in low-lying areas. Perhaps as&#13;
many as 60,000 people or 12,000 families are likely to be displaced as a result of destabilization of&#13;
slopes and flooding of low areas in three departments of the north coast: Tumbes, Piura and&#13;
Lambayeque. Civil defense authorities (INDECI) together with Regional Governments and the&#13;
National Commission for Formalization of Informal Properties (COFOPRI) have estimated that of&#13;
these 60,000 people, as many as 30,000 people (6,000 families) would need to be resettled&#13;
permanently from their current place of residence. The other 30,000 persons or 6,000 families&#13;
may need to be temporarily resettled in case of floods that may make their place of residence&#13;
unsafe for a short period of time. The following table displays the expected numbers of families&#13;
which will require reconstruction programs to return to their sites of origin and those which will&#13;
require permanent resettlement programs in the evacuation sites. In some communities, portions&#13;
of the population will require reconstruction while others will require resettlement. These&#13;
numbers are estimates and will be refined during completion of the necessary studies in the field&#13;
prior to approval of plans.&#13;

32.   Three broad phases of resettlement are expected during the course of the impact of the El&#13;
Nifno phenomenon - Evacuation of Families At-Risk, the Emergency itself and the Reconstruction&#13;
and Resettlement phase. All families at risk will be involved in the first phase, whereas the second&#13;
and third phases distinguish among those families able to return to sites of origin and reconstruct&#13;
or repair their homes and those who must be resettled permanently in new locations.&#13;
(a)   Phase 1: Evacuation of Families At-Risk. The first phase entails the immediate&#13;
evacuation of populations at risk of flooding or landslide and their transfer to&#13;
temporary housing (communal barracks) in stable areas at higher locations,&#13;
together with temporary provision of potable water, electricity, latrines, health&#13;
services and communal kitchens. Due to the emergency conditions, INDECI and&#13;
the Regional Governments have already selected the sites for temporary transfer in&#13;
all three Departments, land leveling and zoning into lots has begun in Tumbes and&#13;
some parts of Piura, and installation of temporary housing has started in Tumbes.&#13;
It is expected that all evacuation sites will be ready to receive affected families by&#13;
December, 1997. Evacuation will be carried out by INDECI. In several instances,&#13;
Government has determined that the at-risk population will not be able to return to&#13;
their original homes, and, therefore, evacuation sites will be laid out from the&#13;
beginning as permanent new settlements (individual family lots). In these cases,&#13;
COFOPRI will provide property titles and registry services to affected families&#13;
transferred during the succeeding phases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
(b)   Phase 2: Emergency. During the expected emergency, the response to which will&#13;
be met by other institutions, the 01 will carry out needed planning studies for the&#13;
reconstruction and resettlement operations, including social and environmental&#13;
assessments of the alternative solutions (reconstruction in original sites or&#13;
permanent resettlement in evacuation areas). The social assessments, containing&#13;
reconstruction plans and resettlement plans, as well as environmental management&#13;
plans, will be completed by June 30, 1998.&#13;
(c)   Phase 3: Reconstruction and Resettlement. Reconstruction plans will be&#13;
implemented for those areas that can be stabilized by civil works like drainage&#13;
canals and retention walls. For areas such as coastal and riverine floodplains,&#13;
unstable river banks, and steep canyons which cannot be stabilized with civil works&#13;
in a cost effective manner, resettlement plans will be implemented to permanently&#13;
resettle populations in areas to which they were evacuated during the emergency.&#13;
The proposed operation will support preparation of site-specific Resettlement&#13;
Action Plans, including definitive installation of infrastructure, provision of public&#13;
services, community participation in operation and maintenance of public works&#13;
and services, capacity building to assist economic productivity of affected families,&#13;
social development programs targeting especially vulnerable groups (e.g.&#13;
fishermen, women, youth), and environmental management programs for the&#13;
resettlement areas. In the areas of origin that are evacuated permanently,&#13;
additional environmentally and socially sustainable management plans will be&#13;
formulated to ensure settlements are not regenerated once the emergency is over.&#13;
33.   To implement this resettlement program, the 01 will contract a Reconstruction and&#13;
Resettlement Team (RRT) at the end of the Evacuation Phase at the latest to provide technical&#13;
assistance and to supervise and monitor implementation of this component. This RRT will consist&#13;
of an anthropologist/sociologist, a social worker and an economist, each with prior experience&#13;
with resettlement operations. The team will be responsible for carrying out a Social Assessment&#13;
(SA) which will provide the basis for resettlement and reconstruction planning during the&#13;
Emergency Phase. The SA will consist of baseline socioeconomic data on the affected&#13;
population, formulation of a process of consultation with affected populations and institutions&#13;
concerned, analysis of the socioeconomic issues to be encountered in the operations, an analysis&#13;
of vulnerability to identify special needs, and the resettlement and reconstruction plans themselves&#13;
based on the foregoing assessment.&#13;
34.   The Regional Governments concerned, COFOPRI and the 01 will then review,&#13;
adjust/revise as needed, finalize and submit for the no objection of the Bank the proposed plans,&#13;
which will then be officially issued no later than June 30, 1998. Resettlement and reconstruction&#13;
plans will be implemented by Regional Governments supported by COFOPRI. The RRT will&#13;
assist the relevant institutions in the implementation of these operations and provide the OI with&#13;
bi-monthly monitoring reports and semi-annual evaluation reports. The project will support&#13;
appointment of the RRT, strengthening of COFOPRI offices in the field, and appointment of&#13;
short-term consultant specialists as may be needed in addition to office, communications and&#13;
transport equipment needed to implement the resettlement and reconstruction programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
35.   The Borrower and the Bank have agreed upon the overall resettlement policy and legal&#13;
framework, the institutional responsibilities for implementation of resettlement operations, the&#13;
design criteria which will be utilized for the operations, and the financial responsibilities and&#13;
estimated budgetary requirements (see Appendix 6). These agreements will guide the&#13;
resettlement planning process and form the basis for Bank review and approval of final&#13;
resettlement plans.&#13;
36.    The following table displays cost estimates for each department. Estimates are based on&#13;
the expected costs of permanent resettlement and the assumption that costs of reconstruction in&#13;
sites of origin will be similar.&#13;

37.    The total cost of this resettlement operation is estimated to be US$ 28,204,000 (Table 4).&#13;
Of this, the Bank will finance up to an estimated US$17 million for the provision of infrastructure&#13;
services to the resettlement facilities for those families that will be permanently resettled, in&#13;
addition to technical assistance for strengthening capacity of the OI and COFOPRI to deal with&#13;
resettlement issues (this is described in the institutional strengthening component below). These&#13;
basic infrastructure services may include potable water supplies, provision of electricity, internal&#13;
and access roads, drainage systems, and sanitation services. The Borrower will finance from its&#13;
own resources the provision of replacement land and houses, mobilization and transfer of the&#13;
population, public services such as education and health, and all recurrent administrative,&#13;
personnel, equipment and vehicle costs of the Government agencies and institutions contributing&#13;
to the design and implementation of different aspects of the resettlement program. The estimated&#13;
costs of these elements is US$ 11 million (US$ 5.5 million for land and housing, US$ 2.4 million&#13;
for public services, US$1 million for transfer, and US$ 2.1 million for administrative costs).&#13;
3 A 120 m2 lot will be allocated at no cost to each affected family. Lands are municipal government property&#13;
today, which will be transferred to COFOPRI for allocation and titling to the affected families.&#13;
4 A basic module house with one room of 1 1 m2 will be provided free of cost to each family. Communal kitchens&#13;
and latines will be provided in each area. Total cost is US$ 453 per family.&#13;
Land leveling, division into lots, and provision of water supply, electricity, access and internal roads are&#13;
calculated at US$ 100,000 per hectare.&#13;
6 Studies and consultants include US$ 300,000 for the OI Resettlement and Reconstruction Team, US$ 150,000 for&#13;
consultants to conduct Environmental Audits and Environmental Assessments, and US$ 280,000 to establish&#13;
regional offices of COFOPRI to issue titles to land and houses, US$ 200,000 to establish a social work unit in&#13;
COFOPRI field offices, and US$ 250,000 to finance restoration of mangrove forests in protected areas by&#13;
Pronatura of Peru.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
38.   Labor intensive rural public works program. In the event of a severe drought in the&#13;
Altiplano, this component would also finance a labor intensive rural public works program aimed&#13;
at providing a safety net to vulnerable groups affected by the drought and who would otherwise&#13;
migrate out of the Altiplano to the coastal areas in search of employment. These works would&#13;
also strengthen sustainable agricultural capacity of drought prone areas in the long run. Such a&#13;
rural public works would be designed on the following principles:&#13;
(a)   that it be undertaken only in the event of a drought in the Altiplano;&#13;
(b)   that it be well targeted;&#13;
(c)   that it be time limited and not become permanent;&#13;
(d)   that the works undertaken be only on public (rather than private) infrastructure;&#13;
(e)   that it be implemented through an agency with demonstrated capacity for such&#13;
works in the Altiplano; and&#13;
(f)   that it be monitored through the Office of Investments.&#13;
39.   The details of the design of such a rural public works program and the implementing&#13;
mechanisms will be agreed upon with the Government and the agreement on the regulations&#13;
governing the implementation of such a program will form a condition for the disbursement of this&#13;
component.&#13;
D.    Institutional Support Component. (approx. US$ 7 million)&#13;
40.   This component will finance: (a) specialized equipment, technical assistance and training&#13;
aimed at strengthening the capacity of selected Peruvian institutions to forecast and respond to&#13;
future El Nin'o episodes; (b) the preparation of a comprehensive Government strategy for disaster&#13;
forecasting and management; and (c) project management and other consulting services in support&#13;
of MEF's Office of Investments, as required to adequately carry out project implementation. It is&#13;
worth noting that, in spite of the short-term emergency nature of this operation, this component&#13;
aims to increase the long-term sustainable impact of Bank involvement.&#13;
41.   Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building. This subcomponent aims to&#13;
strengthen the capacity of selected Peruvian institutions responsible for forecasting, preventing,&#13;
mitigating and monitoring the effects of, and carrying out relief activities in connection with this&#13;
year's and future El Nino episodes. The Bank will finance specialized equipment, technical&#13;
assistance and training for four institutions that have been identified in close consultation with the&#13;
Ministry of Economy and Finance7: Instituto Geofisico del Perui (IGP), Instituto del Mar del Peru&#13;
(IMARPE), Instituto Nacional de Defiensa Civil (INDECI) and Servicio Nacional de&#13;
Meteorologia e Hidrologil (SENAMHI). Each one of these institutions has prepared preliminary&#13;
requests for Bank financing. The technical and institutional soundness of the four requests will be&#13;
reviewed by GOP and the Bank, with the benefit of qualified external reviewers, during the early&#13;
7 These institutions are statutory memrbers of the "Estudio Regional del Fen6meno del Milo" (ERFEN) which was&#13;
established by the intergovernmental Comisi6n Permanente del Pacifico Sur, and was recently ratified by&#13;
GOP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
stage of project implementation. In reviewing the four requests, GOP and the Bank will take into&#13;
account the proposals made by these institutions for close cooperation and operational&#13;
coordination among them during project implementation and beyond, as well as the total amount&#13;
of resources available for this subcomponent. The end result of the review will be a consolidated&#13;
list of equipment, technical assistance and training which would be financed by the Bank. The&#13;
following paragraphs reflect the nature and scope of the above-mentioned preliminary requests,&#13;
which are described in greater detail in Appendix 5.&#13;
(a)   Instituto Geofisico del Perui (IGP). To strengthen Peru's capacity to forecast&#13;
climate changes, including El Nino, IGP aims to use free-of-charge scientific&#13;
models recently developed by the scientific community worldwide (including the&#13;
USA's National Center for Atmospheric Research) as inputs to regional models of&#13;
climate change over Peru and high-resolution models of sea surface temperature&#13;
off the Peruvian coast. Other inputs include real-time observations of Peru's&#13;
atmosphere and coastal ocean which would be collected by automatic instrument&#13;
platforms and manual measuring operations. These will also provide the basis for&#13;
short and long-term weather forecasting. While IGP would be responsible for this&#13;
sub-component, it may choose to enter into specific "sub-contracting" agreements&#13;
with other institutions such as the Universidad de Piura (UdeP) and the Direcci6n&#13;
de Hidrografiay Navegaci6n (DHN), and possibly Instituto del Mar del Peru&#13;
(IMARPE). It is likely that IGP would ask: (a) DHN, and probably IMARPE, to&#13;
maintain and operate maritime and coastal instruments; and (b) UdeP to build and,&#13;
with DHN's assistance, operate a wind profiler, a sea-state radar in Lobos de&#13;
Afuera island, and a boundary layer radar. Regional forecasts would be made&#13;
available to the Instituto de Defensa Civil (INDECI), the Ministry of Agriculture,&#13;
other sector ministries and the general public via Internet. Real-time observations&#13;
of the atmosphere would be shared with SENAMIJI. Ocean state parameters and&#13;
predictions would be made available to IMARPE.&#13;
(b)   Instituto del Mar del Peru (IMARPE). Fishing is a major economic activity in&#13;
Peru. The Instituto del Mar del Peru (IMARPE) is responsible for carrying out&#13;
research and monitoring the impact of several factors (such as climate changes and&#13;
fishing intensity) on the biomass off Peru's coast. This sub-component would help&#13;
IMARPE strengthen its operations. It would finance specialized equipment for 3&#13;
coastal laboratories, advanced graduate training in relevant disciplines and&#13;
specialized foreign assistance for management of pelagic species, data processing&#13;
and forecasting, and integrated coastal zones.&#13;
(c)   Instituto Nacional de Defensa Civil (INDECI). INDECI is responsible for&#13;
designing and implementing disaster prevention and relief activities in Peru. It&#13;
encourages the public and the private sector to carry out analyses of risks and&#13;
vulnerability, and aims to improve the availability of human and logistical resources&#13;
nationwide. Bank financing under this sub-component would allow INDECI to&#13;
procure equipment needed to receive data from weather satellites, water level&#13;
controls and alarm systems to be used in rivers, enhancements to existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Geographic Information System, and an integrated countrywide communication&#13;
system.-'&#13;
(d)   Servicio Nacional de Metereologia v Hidrologia (SENAMHI). The Servcio&#13;
Nacional de Metereologia e Hidrologia (SENAMHI) has identified, as its main&#13;
requirements: (a) improving and expanding its existing meteorological,&#13;
hydrological and environmental data collection stations; (b) improving its&#13;
communication systems; and (c) improving its climatologic data base.&#13;
42.   Comprehensive Strategy for Disaster Forecasting and Management. This&#13;
subcomponent will finance technical assistance to Government aimed at preparing a&#13;
comprehensive strategy for disaster forecasting and management. An action-oriented study will&#13;
be conducted, whose main objectives will be: (a) to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of&#13;
existing Peruvian institutions dealing with disaster forecasting, prevention, mitigation, monitoring&#13;
and relief; (b) to'compare them against best practice available worldwide; and (c) to recommend a&#13;
comprehensive strategy for eventual adoption by Government. The draft terms of reference for&#13;
this study are attached as Appendix 4.&#13;
43.   TechnicalAssistancefor the Project Coordinaton Unit. The project will also finance&#13;
technical assistance to the Office of Investments in the Ministry of Economy and Finance which&#13;
will be coordinating the implementation of this project (project implementation arrangements are&#13;
described in greater detail below). In particular, this sub-component will finance project&#13;
management consultants whose main responsibilities would be to:&#13;
(a)   Provide a recommendation to the tri-partite approval committee based on a&#13;
technical evaluation of the sub-projects presented for reconstruction;&#13;
(b)   Ensure compliance of the proposed reconstruction works with the eligibility&#13;
criteria;&#13;
(c)   Ensure that the procurement procedures followed are in conformity with Bank&#13;
guidelines;&#13;
(d)   Ensure that the reconstruction sub-projects are undertaken in accordance with the&#13;
environmental guidelines set out in the Project Operating Manual;&#13;
(e)    Support the Borrower in preparing disbursement requests; and&#13;
(f)    Prepare quality progress reports on project implementation to be sent to the Bank.&#13;
44.   The mobilization of the project consultants, through a signed contract with the Borrower,&#13;
would be a condition for disbursement of the reconstruction phase.&#13;
INDECI has also requested financing of items to be used during the emergency (blankets, clothes, shelters, hand&#13;
tools, portable power generators, portable water tanks, fuel, kitchen and eating utensils, rescue equipment,&#13;
food, medicines, etc.) This is likely to be provided through a complementary project being prepared by the&#13;
Inter-American Development Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
45.   In addition, the Project will also finance technical assistance to the OI and to other entities&#13;
involved in the resettlement program (approx. US$1.7 million) to support the planning and&#13;
implementation of the resettlement activities. This sub-component will finance: (i) strengthening&#13;
of COFOPRI field offices through personnel, equipment and vehicles to enable it to carry out&#13;
surveys of families that are being displaced, (ii) costs of the COFOPRI titling process and the&#13;
provision of social work assistance to affected persons, and (iii) costs of studies and surveys by&#13;
specialist consultants and other personnel to carry out the Environmental Assessments.&#13;
Environmental Imnact&#13;
46.   El Nifno potentially represents a major environmental disaster. The project is designed to&#13;
reduce the social and economic impacts of the disaster, to provide for emergency assistance&#13;
during the event, and to support socially and environmentally sustainable reconstruction and&#13;
recovery following the disaster. Environmental impacts will be associated with both the&#13;
prevention and reconstruction stages, and will be addressed through Environmental Audits with&#13;
the objective of designing and implementing Environmental Management Programs for each of&#13;
the project components and major sub-components as needed.&#13;
47.   Environmental Assessments. Environmental Assessments (EAs) will be conducted for&#13;
emergency prevention measures implemented from July 1997 to December 31, 1997. The 01 will&#13;
contract a qualified and experienced environmental firm or entity to conduct the assessments. The&#13;
assessments will consist of: (a) analysis of the environmental impact of project components and&#13;
major sub-components (e.g. drainage works, resettlement sites, etc.); (b) assessment of the&#13;
designs of mitigation or management programs to address the environmental impacts identified;&#13;
and, (c) evaluation and verification of compliance with applicable environmental criteria and&#13;
standards of proposed environmental management programs as integral elements of the project&#13;
components and sub-components.&#13;
48.   Environmental assessments will also be required for certain projects and sub-projects of&#13;
the reconstruction phase, the exact locations and magnitudes of which cannot be identified at this&#13;
moment. Therefore, all proposed reconstruction phase investments will be screened for potential&#13;
environmental impacts according to criteria agreed between the Bank and the Borrower. Where&#13;
environmental assessments are required, these together with their resulting Environmental&#13;
Management Plans (EMPs) will be submitted to the 01 for approval prior to beginning any works.&#13;
The Bank will review and express its no objection to the first 10% of such works, and thereafter&#13;
spot check for performance.&#13;
PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
49.   The costs of the prevention phase are estimated to be approximately US$ 100 million, of&#13;
which funds from the proposed Loan would finance up to US$30 million. An additional US$30&#13;
million would be financed by the Inter-American Development Bank with the rest being met from&#13;
Government resources and others. The costs for the reconstruction phase cannot be estimated&#13;
with any degree of certainty at this time; based on the experience of the 1982-83 event, it is&#13;
estimated that the costs of reconstruction may be of the order of US$500 million if the 1997-98 El&#13;
Nifio event is of "moderate" to "severe" intensity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20 -&#13;
50.   The proposed Loan is expected to finance about one third of the cost of reconstruction&#13;
activities subject to a maximum of US$150 million for the overall project (including the&#13;
prevention activities). The IDB has made a similar amount available for prevention, emergency&#13;
relief and reconstruction activities. The Government also plans to mobilize additional financing&#13;
from the bilateral donors such as Japan for possible reconstruction activities.&#13;
51.   At the end of the first six months of Loan effectiveness, the Bank and the Government will&#13;
assess jointly the size of the damage of the El Nifno. If the damage is significantly less than&#13;
anticipated at the time of the presentation of this project, the Bank reserves the right to cancel all&#13;
or part of the Loan.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
52.   Project Implementation Arrangements. The implementation arrangements in the&#13;
prevention phase have been coordinated at the highest levels of the Government with the active&#13;
involvement of President Fujimori since the emergency was first declared in June 1997. Given the&#13;
scale of the works and the short lead time until the arrival of heavy rains (i.e. December 1997),&#13;
most of the works have been undertaken directly by the concerned sector ministries and/or other&#13;
public sector bodies, including the National Institute of Civil Defense, by force account, i.e. using&#13;
their own work forces. These works have been coordinated by the National Commission for&#13;
Emergency Assistance (CONAE) under the Ministry of the Presidency (MIPRE) during July and&#13;
August and subsequently by the Council of Ministers. Municipal authorities, and to a smaller&#13;
extent, local communities have been involved in drawing up of the emergency prevention&#13;
program, though their involvement in the implementation of the works has been limited due to the&#13;
complexity and urgency of the programme.&#13;
53.  In the reconstruction phase, decisions on the sub-projects to be financed will be made by a&#13;
three person Committee within the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) comprising Vice-&#13;
Minister of Finance, Director-General of Budget and the Head of the Office of Investments (OI).&#13;
A strong decision-making body with authority to make resource allocation decisions is critical to a&#13;
rapid response to the reconstruction effort, while ensuring that only eligible sub-projects damaged&#13;
by the El Nifno events are financed. Responsibility for implementation of the sub-projects will&#13;
remain with those individual Ministries and/or public sector entities under whose authority the&#13;
relevant works fall. They in turn may designate capable public sector institutions or&#13;
regional/municipal entities to carry out the different civil works. Bank financing will be limited to&#13;
institutions with proven implementation capacity and/or familiarity with Bank procedures.&#13;
54.   The Office of Investments (01) of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) will serve&#13;
as the link between the tripartite project approval Committee and the implementation agencies.&#13;
The principal functions of the Office of Investments will be to:&#13;
(a)   coordinate the implementation of the reconstruction program across multiple&#13;
public sector agencies;&#13;
(b)   undertake a technical evaluation of sub-project requests, including their eligibility&#13;
for Bank financing and concordance with other Bank guidelines on procurement,&#13;
environment and resettlement;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(c)   based on this technical evaluation, provide a recommendation on the sub-project to&#13;
the tripartite Committee;&#13;
(d)   monitor the implementation of the reconstruction program, including due attention&#13;
to the resettlement activities and the environment audits;&#13;
(e)   ensure a timely flow of budget resources to implementing agencies;&#13;
(f)   prepare the disbursement requests to the different financing institutions;&#13;
(g)   maintain acceptable accounting, auditing and financial management standards;&#13;
(h)   provide timely reports to financing institutions in regard to project implementation;&#13;
(i)   hire, as needed, specialized consulting services to assist in project implementation;&#13;
and&#13;
(j)   ensure the establishment of an adequate financial management system including&#13;
accounting, internal control, financial reporting and audit arrangements acceptable&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
55.   The Office of Investments will hire a Project Coordinator and a small complement of staff&#13;
including specialists in procurement, environment, and social sectors. It will additionally be&#13;
supported by a project management consulting firm, which would be hired prior to any&#13;
disbursements for reconstruction works. This consulting firm will provide the necessary expertise&#13;
in the technical and economic evaluation of reconstruction investments, monitor implementation,&#13;
assist in establishing a satisfactory financial management system and assist in the supervision of&#13;
procurement and execution of works by the implementing agencies.&#13;
56.   The works to be financed under the reconstruction phase cannot be defined until the&#13;
beginning of 1998 at the earliest, but would need to meet the eligibility criteria defined above.&#13;
The 01 will also monitor the implementation of the rural public works program, in the event of&#13;
drought conditions. The details of the design and operating rules for the rural public works&#13;
program will be agreed upon with the Government prior to any disbursements on this program.&#13;
57.   Procurement Arrangements. The Project will follow the Bank's procurement&#13;
guidelines for goods, services and consultant services. Given the nature of the project in which&#13;
the nature of the works and repairs is not pre-defined, there is no procurement plan. The methods&#13;
and thresholds are fixed on the basis of estimates, flexibility and coordination with the Inter-&#13;
American Development Bank.&#13;
(a)   Civil works. Civil works estimated to cost above US$ 5 million will be procured&#13;
through ICB procedures. There would be few works of such size. Works&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$5 million will be procured through NCB procedures&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. Smaller works estimated to cost less than US$3 million&#13;
will be procured through shopping procedures based on price quotations from at&#13;
least three qualified contractors. Additionally, direct contracting procedures will&#13;
be used for small repair works estimated to cost less than US$100,000 up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$1 million. Rehabilitation of deep and shallow wells and&#13;

land plowing in the drought areas will be financed on the basis of flat rates per&#13;
completed units on the basis of certifications issued by an independent entity&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. Preventive infrastructure works carried out by force&#13;
account by ministries and agencies in the flood areas from June to December 1997,&#13;
will be financed retroactively on the basis of certifications issued by an&#13;
independent entity satisfactory to the Bank up to an aggregate amount of US$30&#13;
million. In addition, small rural works would be carried out through direct&#13;
contracting with the communities (on the basis of unit prices) for individual&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than US$ 20,000, up to an aggregate of US$10&#13;
million.&#13;
(b)   Goods. Goods, including inputs for the production of seeds as well as tools and&#13;
materials for the job generation component, costing less than US$350,000 will be&#13;
procured through shopping procedures. Mobile bridge structures, mobile power&#13;
plants and pumps, metallic mesh structures (gaviones) and selected items costing&#13;
less than US$1 million and which may be urgently required during the peak of the&#13;
emergency will be procured directly from qualified suppliers up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$5 million.&#13;
(c)   Consultant Services. Consulting Services urgently required to implement key&#13;
components of the Project, including the hiring the technical auditors and project&#13;
management support, in contracts costing less than US$500,000 will be procured&#13;
on a sole source basis with firms and on terms and conditions acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Other consulting services, including project supervision during the&#13;
reconstruction phase will be procured using QCBS procedures or by extending the&#13;
contracts of the technical audits depending upon their performance. The&#13;
procurement aspects of the PPF were defined in the corresponding agreement.&#13;
(d)   Miscellaneous. The smaller purchases of sundry items and payment of fees and&#13;
utilities will be made using administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
58.   Review by the Bank. All ICB procedures will be subject to prior review as well as the&#13;
first three NCB procedures for works. All direct contracting of goods and services, except for&#13;
the smaller works below US$100,000 up to the aggregate amount of US$ 1 million, and the&#13;
selected goods for the emergency in packages costing less than US$1 million up to the aggregate&#13;
amount of US$5 million, are subject to prior review by the Bank. The direct contracting of&#13;
consultants as well as the hiring of other consultant services for firms costing more than&#13;
US$100,000 and individuals costing more than US$50,000 will be subject to prior review by the&#13;
Bank. The works and activities subject to certification, including the forage component, well&#13;
rehabilitation and preventive infrastructure works to be included in the force account and&#13;
retroactive financing component, will not require prior review by the Bank, provided that the&#13;
certifications issued by the independent entity accompany the withdrawal applications. Table 5&#13;
summarizes the prior review by the Bank.&#13;

59.   Disbursement Arrangements. The completion date for the project is determined to be&#13;
June 30, 1999 and the Closing Date December 31, 2000. The loan would be disbursed as shown&#13;
in Table 6. Given the availability of a Special Account (SA), the minimum withdrawal application&#13;
for direct payment from the Loan Account would be 20 percent of the initial deposit to the&#13;
Special Account. Withdrawal applications would be fully documented except for contracts for:&#13;
(a) consulting firms costing less than US$100,000; (b) individual consultants costing less than&#13;
US$ 50,000; and (c) works costing less than US$ 5,000,000 and goods costing less than US$&#13;
350,000. These will be reimbursed on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The&#13;
relevant documentation will be retained at the OI for ex-post review by IBRD staff during&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;

60.   The 01 will open a Special Account in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. To&#13;
facilitate disbursements, the authorized allocation for the Special Account would be US$ 15&#13;
million. However, the initial deposit will be US$5 million until the disbursed amount from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Loan Account reaches US$30 million. The Special Account will be replenished by submitting&#13;
withdrawal applications to the Bank on a monthly basis. In addition, the OI will open a Project&#13;
Account to receive the Government counterpart funds to the project.&#13;
61.   Financial Management and Reporting Requirements The Office of Investments will&#13;
be responsible for putting in place a financial management system which will meet the Bank's&#13;
requirements for accounting, personnel, internal control, financial reporting and audits. The OI&#13;
will also submit quarterly reports on project activities to the Bank and participate in project&#13;
reviews with the Bank in June and December of each year of project execution.&#13;
62.   Monitoring The project monitoring indicators are tailored to the rather unusual features&#13;
of this operation, that all disaster prevention works will have been carried during project&#13;
processing (before Board presentation) and that individual reconstruction sub-projects will only&#13;
be identified once the damage caused by the El Ninio event becomes known.&#13;
63.   Because the prevention component is well advanced and on schedule, neither input&#13;
indicators, such as timely availability of resources, nor output indicators, such as actual execution&#13;
of physical works compared to original schedule or actual costs compared to original contract&#13;
costs, are of much use in monitoring the project ex-post. For these works, attention will be paid&#13;
to outcome indicators -- the cost-effectiveness and success of the prevention works in reducing&#13;
the loss of human life and social/economic infrastructure. These indicators will be analyzed in the&#13;
context of the losses incurred as a result of the severe El Niio in 1982-83 when little or no&#13;
preventive works were undertaken.&#13;
64.   Progress under the reconstruction component is more easily amenable to traditional&#13;
monitoring indicators. These indicators will be developed in detail as part of the Operational&#13;
Manual, which will be acceptable to the Bank and will include input, output and outcome&#13;
indicators.&#13;
(a)   The main input indicators would be used to monitor the efficiency with which&#13;
MEF's Office of Investments carries out its coordinating work: resource&#13;
availability (timeliness of local counterpart funds), skills (adequate staffing of unit),&#13;
procurement (amount of time required for various phases of sub-project&#13;
procurement), contract administration (amount of time required to pay sub-project&#13;
contractors), adequate accounting, financial, management and reporting practices,&#13;
appropriate internal controls, etc.&#13;
(b)   The main output indicators would monitor the compliance of the sub-projects with&#13;
the eligibility criteria spelled out in the Operational Manual, and efficiency and&#13;
speed with which they were carried out.&#13;
(c)   The main outcome indicators, which will be observed only in future years, will&#13;
reflect the extent to which reconstructed infrastructure will be able to withstand&#13;
future El Nifio events.&#13;
65.   Finally, the institutional strengthening component will be monitored in terms of output and&#13;
outcome indicators. The main output indicators will reflect the timely execution of the various&#13;
phases of the consultant's work as set forth in the Terms of Reference -- these will be finalized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
shortly after loan effectiveness. The main outcome indicators will be: Government's early&#13;
adoption of a comprehensive strategy for disaster forecasting and management; and the&#13;
effectiveness of the new strategy and institutional setup to respond to future disasters.&#13;
66.   Supervision Plan The detailed implementation schedule for the emergency operation will&#13;
remain uncertain until the full impact of the 1997-98 El Ninio event is known. Notwithstanding&#13;
the uncertainty, a supervision plan for the first phase until mid 1998 has been drawn up, with later&#13;
plans being outlined in broader terms until the anticipated loan closing date of December 31,&#13;
2000. Three general principles will govern the initial phase of the supervision plan:&#13;
(a)   Close supervision by a core project team, drawn mainly from headquarters because&#13;
of the needed expertise in procurement (review/approval of certification audits of&#13;
prevention works undertaken by force account during July-December 1997),&#13;
financial management to assess the adequacy of the systems in place, resettlement&#13;
(review of resettlement plans) and the institutional strengthening component.&#13;
(b)   Involvement of the field office in Peru in (a) monitoring on a monthly basis, overall&#13;
progress in implementation, in particular status of compliance with disbursement&#13;
conditions, and (b) undertaking visits to affected regions as needed using either&#13;
Resident Mission staff or local consultants.&#13;
(c)   Joint supervision with the IDB project team to ensure close coordination and&#13;
synergies in overall supervision effort.&#13;
67.   The estimated supervision effort in the first 7 months of supervision (December 1997-June&#13;
1998) would be 22 staff weeks of mainly Bank headquarters staff and some local staff .&#13;
Supervision activities in this period will likely to include a project launch workshop and a full&#13;
supervision mission complemented by field visits from local staff and consultants.&#13;

First full supervision mission  March 1998   Flood, drought, institutional,&#13;

Second supervision mission  June-July 1998   Flood, drought, institutional&#13;
68.   The supervision plan for the period July 1998 until December 2000 when the project is&#13;
scheduled to close would be determined by the scope and duration of the disaster emergency&#13;
which may not be known until mid 1998. On the assumption of a moderate to severe El Nifio&#13;
event (which has guided reconstruction estimates in this report), the main objectives of the&#13;
supervision plan would be as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(a)   Two superviision mission per year from headquarters on average 20 staff weeks per&#13;
year.&#13;
(b)   Increasing delegation to Resident Mission to expedite decision making on&#13;
operational issues, including procurement, once the necessary expertise is recruited&#13;
and/or established in the Resident Mission (by mid 1998). Field visits to affected&#13;
areas would be undertaken from the Resident Mission.&#13;
(c)   Close Bank-IDB coordination throughout.&#13;
(d)   Determination in consultation with the Government, and no later than December&#13;
1998, the impact of the disaster emergency, and whether there is a need for partial&#13;
or complete cancellation of undisbursed funds.&#13;

(e)   progreso fisico de la obra, la fecha de inicio, la fecha de terminaci6n;&#13;
(f)   nombre del supervisor o entidad encargada de la supervisi6n;&#13;
(g)   en la medida de lo posible, las partidas presupuestarias imputadas; y&#13;
(h)   un c6digo unico de obra que servira para prop6sitos de registro, archivo y&#13;
comprobaciones de auditoria, supervisi6n o verificaci6n por parte del Banco&#13;
Mundial.&#13;
3.    El inventario podra incluir obras con un valor superior a un monto minimo que sera&#13;
determinado por los Consultores, con vista a las metas financieras de reembolso y financiamiento&#13;
retroactivo que el Cliente le informara oportunamente, pero en ningun caso inferiores al&#13;
equivalente de [US$100,000] equivalente. Si al momento de iniciarse las actividades, el Cliente&#13;
dispone del inventario, los Consultores solamente deberan conocer y familiarizarse con tal&#13;
inventario y usarlo como referencia para las siguientes actividades.&#13;
Segunda actividad: Determinaci6n de la Prioridad de las Obras para Certificaci6n&#13;
4.    Una vez concluido el inventario general, los Consultores determinaran la prioridad para la&#13;
selecci6n de las obras que seran objeto de certificaci6n, generalmente escogiendo las obras de&#13;
mayor valor en primera instancia. En la determinaci6n de la lista preliminar de obras sujetas a&#13;
certificaci6n, los Consultores deberan tomar en cuenta:&#13;
(a)   que las obras hayan sido contratadas en alguna forma;&#13;
(b)   que un porcentaje estimado del [25%] de las obras en tal lista podrian no reunir la&#13;
informaci6n o condiciones apropiadas para producir una certificaci6n final en el&#13;
corto plazo;&#13;
(c)   que el Banco Mundial podria contribuir al financiamiento parcial de las obras por&#13;
un monto que oscilaria entre [50% y 60%] del costo certificado; y&#13;
(d)   que el costo certificado podria diferir substancialmente respecto al costo estimado&#13;
o documentado de las obras. Los consultores deberan informar al Cliente sobre la&#13;
fista preliminar a examinar.&#13;
Tercera actividad: Formacion de los Equipos de Trabajo&#13;
5.    Una vez establecido el orden de prioridad para el trabajo de certificaci6n, los Consultores&#13;
procederan a establecer equipos de trabajo para cada una de las Regiones, Provincias u obras, u&#13;
otra forma de organizaci6n que los Consultores consideren a su juicio apropiado para la ejecuci6n&#13;
oportuna de las tareas, asegurando que la metodologia y estandar de calidad de la Certificaci6n a&#13;
ser emitida es uniforme. Antes de la movilizaci6n y el trabajo de campo, los Consultores deberan&#13;
informar al Ministerio de Economia y Finanzas sobre la formaci6n de los Grupos de Trabajo. En&#13;
cada caso, los equipos deberan estar encabezados por profesionales en ingenieria de reconocida&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32-&#13;
reputaci6n y acompafiados de expertos en contabilidad y otras disciplinas. Los Consultores&#13;
deberan proporcionar a sus equipos una estrecha supervision de los equipos para asegurar su&#13;
independencia de criterio y las normas de desempefno.&#13;
Cuarta actividad: Trabajo de Campo y Producci6n de Certificados&#13;
6.    Una vez completado el trabajo de campo y revisi6n de pruebas documentales, los&#13;
Consultores deberan compilar y procesar la informaci6n recopilada, ampliar la base de datos y&#13;
establecer una lista borrador de obras certificables. Si los numeros satisfacen las metas, los&#13;
Consultores deberan proceder con la etapa final de certificacion que consiste en la emisi6n del&#13;
borrador de la lista final y los correspondientes Certificados que podran constituir las solicitudes&#13;
de desembolso.&#13;
7.    Si por el contrario, los resultados de la visita al campo y el procesamiento de la&#13;
informaci6n derivada anticipa insuficiencia en los montos que seran sujetos de certificaci6n, los&#13;
Consultores deberan informar prontamente al Cliente y al Banco Mundial sobre esta situacion y&#13;
proponer las soluciones para aumentar el nuimero de actividades o acciones que conduzcan a&#13;
incrementar los desembolsos de la porci6n retroactiva del financiamiento.&#13;
C.    Metodolofia de Revisi6n v Certificaci6n&#13;
8.    Los Consultores deberin emplear tecnicas de metrado de cantidades de las obras,&#13;
comprobacion de registros y datos de costos disponibles en las zonas donde se efectuan o&#13;
efectuaron las obras. Tales tecnicas deberin ser consistentes con pricticas internacionalmente&#13;
reconocidas de ingenieria y de auditoria tecnica que aseguren un alto nivel de confiabilidad y&#13;
precision, que a su vez, aseguren al Cliente y al Banco Mundial que ha habido un uso adecuado,&#13;
econ6mico y eficiente de los recursos empleados dentro de las circunstancias de emergencia del&#13;
Proyecto.&#13;
9.    En las visitas de campo, los Consultores deberan comprobar la exdstencia de las obras,&#13;
mediante tareas que pudieran incluir, pero no limitarse a, la combinaci6n de las siguientes&#13;
tecnicas:&#13;
(a)   comprobaciones fisicas;&#13;
(b)   mediciones topogrificas;&#13;
(c)   pruebas de laboratorio geotecnicos;&#13;
(d)   entrevistas a los directores de las obras, personal tecnico, supervisores,&#13;
interventores, contratistas, operadores y beneficiarios;&#13;
(e)   comprobaciones de facturaciones realizadas por contratistas y proveedores; y&#13;
(f)   comprobaciones de registros y libros de contratistas y proveedores, en el niumero&#13;
y la naturaleza que los Consultores juzguen apropiado para rendir un testimonio&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
fidedigno, que a su vez, permita una determinaci6n precisa y una descripci6n&#13;
certificada sobre los volumenes y caracteristicas de las obras.&#13;
D.    Valuacion de las Obras v Costo Certificado&#13;
10.   Una vez determinada las caracteristicas fisicas y volumetricas de las obras seleccionadas,&#13;
los Consultores procederan a establecer un costo certificado. Este costo certificado individual&#13;
debera elaborarse y mantenerse en forma confidencial por lo menos hasta la revisi6n del borrador&#13;
de la lista final de obras certificadas por parte del Cliente.&#13;
11.   En la elaboraci6n del costo certificado, los Consultores tendran en cuenta los precios de&#13;
mercado, la naturaleza de emergencia de las obras, la lejania de las obras, la experiencia de los&#13;
Consultores, las contribuciones en especie, el costo del combustible, el trabajo comunal y&#13;
voluntario, la contribuci6n material, intelectual y administrativa de los organismos ejecutores,&#13;
incluyendo las intervenciones por parte del Cuerpo de Ingenieros de las FF.AA., los registros&#13;
contables y presupuestarios y toda otra informacion que a juicio de los Consultores ileve a una&#13;
determinaci6n de un valor certificable de las obras para los prop6sitos de reconocimiento de&#13;
inversiones por parte del Banco Mundial tomando en cuenta que el Banco no financia impuestos o&#13;
trabajos ejecutados por intervenciones militares.&#13;
12.   Los Consultores mantendran una memoria de calculo de sus estimaciones que llevaron a la&#13;
determinaci6n del valor certificado por cada una de las obras. El Cliente tendri acceso, por&#13;
pedido o inspecci6n, a tales memorias de calculo y podra solicitar a los Consultores que excluyan&#13;
cualquier obra de la certificaci6n final, cuando, en opinion del Cliente, el costo a ser certificado&#13;
resulte excesivamente diferente por exceso o defecto de sus propios registros o noci6n de costo.&#13;
13.   En ningiun caso, el Cliente podri pedir que se corrija el monto certificado, excepto cuando&#13;
a juicio del Cliente, la discrepancia se pueda deber a omisiones significativas, en cuyo caso, a&#13;
juicio del Cliente, se podra discutir con el Banco Mundial la conciliaci6n de tales discrepancias.&#13;
14.   Los Consultores presentaran un borrador de listado de obras certificadas, en el plazo abajo&#13;
sefialando, con indicacion del monto certificado en el formato acordado con el Banco Mundial. El&#13;
Cliente dispondra de tres dias para opinar sobre el borrador y presentar a los Consultores una lista&#13;
de exclusiones y una lista de discrepancias senialando errores significativos.&#13;
15.   En el termino de dos dias a partir de la recepcion de las listas de exclusiones y&#13;
correcciones, los Consultores procederan a emitir:&#13;
(a)   una lista final de obras certificadas acompaniadas de su certificado individual para&#13;
cada obra, eliminando la obras excluidas por el Cliente y efectuando las&#13;
correcciones que a su juicio si pudieran obedecer a errores, empleando el formato&#13;
acordado con el Banco Mundial para prop6sito de reconocimiento y desembolso; y&#13;
(b)   una lista obras con las discrepancias sefialadas por el Cliente junto con su opini6n&#13;
sobre errores sefialados, memoria de costos y toda informaci6n que considere&#13;
conveniente presentar para la conciliaci6n de discrepancias con el Banco Mundial&#13;
arriba apuntada.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
16.   Una vez emitida la lista final, los Consultores podran emitir suplementos a la lista final de&#13;
obras certificadas conforme las discrepancias se resuelven o para incorporar obras adicionales de&#13;
conformidad con el progreso de su trabajo para complementar las metas financieras que resulten&#13;
despues de efectuados los primeros desembolsos.&#13;
17.   Los costos certificados seran expresados en d6lares equivalentes al tipo de cambio&#13;
promedio del mes en que se realizaron los trabajos y tales calculos deberan ser reflejados en las&#13;
hojas de calculo de cada obra.&#13;
18.   Los Consultores mantendrAn registros ordenados y consistentes con la hoja de inventario y&#13;
la lista final disponibles para los auditores, inspectores que el Cliente o el Banco Mundial designen&#13;
para sus prop6sitos de comprobaci6n, muestreo o desembolso.&#13;
19.   Los Consultores no estAn obligados a ofrecer explicaciones detalladas al Cliente sobre la&#13;
imposibilidad de certificar obras incluidas en el listado preliminar, pudiendo limitarse a indicar&#13;
que, en su opini6n, la informaci6n compilada o disponible al momento de su asignaci6n era&#13;
insuficiente para certificar las obras realizadas de conformidad con estos Terminos de Referencia.&#13;
Los Consultores podran sin embargo ofrecer al Cliente recomendaciones de las acciones que los&#13;
organismos ejecutores podrian tomar para elevar el nivel de informaci6n disponible sobre obras&#13;
especificas que puedan ser certificadas con posterioridad.&#13;
E.    Porcentaie de Financiamiento&#13;
20.   Eni base al listado final de obras certificadas, los Consultores deberan incluir en el&#13;
certificado individual de las obras una recomendaci6n del porcentaje de financiamiento por parte&#13;
del Banco Mundial y la Contraparte Nacional.&#13;
21.   Al presentar su recomendaci6n de financiamiento, los Consultores tomaran en cuenta:&#13;
(a)   el uso y depreciaci6n de maquinaria o el valor de otros insumos que pudiesen&#13;
haberse sido objeto de financiamiento separado;&#13;
(b)   el monto de los impuestos nacionales o de importaci6n que los OMF no pueden&#13;
financiar;&#13;
(c)   la contribuci6n del Cuerpo de Ingenieros de las FF.AA. o de otras fuentes de&#13;
ayuda o financiamiento que pudiesen estar asociados al costo de cada una de las&#13;
obras;&#13;
(d)   el grado de conexi6n de las obras con el Fen6meno de El Nifio y la emergencia; y&#13;
(e)   la elegibilidad de los bienes y servicios por fuente de financiamniento.&#13;
22.   No obstante la referida recomendaci6n, el Cliente podra considerar y solicitar a las fuentes&#13;
de financiamiento porcentajes por encimna o por debajo de tal recomendaci6n en base a razones&#13;
que discutira con los Consultores, y cuya opini6n, sera dada a conocer al Banco Mundial en cada&#13;
caso.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
F.    Certificaci6n de las Obras&#13;

Certificaciones parciales o condicionadas no seran consideradas como certificados validos.&#13;
G.   Auditorias tecnicas v sugervisi6n de obras.&#13;
25.   La participaci6n de los Consultores en el proceso de certificaci6n no impediria a los&#13;
consultores participar en las contrataciones de servicios de ingenieria y supervisi6n o de auditoria&#13;
tecnica de otras obras dentro de los alcances del Proyecto de Emergencia.&#13;
H.   Forma de Pago.&#13;
26.   Se negociari con los Consultores una forma de pago proporcional al costo certificado de&#13;
las obras, que podri ser variable por Regi6n o por tipo de obra vial, hidraulica fluvial, agricola,&#13;

APPENDIX 3&#13;
DROUGHT COMPONENT SIERRA SUR&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    While drought is a constant threat to agricultural production in the Sierra Sur, records&#13;
show that its effects are strengthened in El Ninio years, with particular devastation during the last&#13;
strong El Niiio of 1982-83. During that year, according to data from NOAA, damages to the&#13;
economy of the Altiplano of Peru and Bolivia were estimated to be US$250 million.&#13;
2.    During 1982-83 estimates for the Department of Puno (Ministerio de Agricultura) show&#13;
that crop production was reduced by 70%, while livestock sales increased by 25%. These&#13;
increased sales were forced due to the lack of forage. Because of the decimation of livestock&#13;
herds and the lack of food in local markets, the social effects of the drought were devastating,&#13;
resulting in mass migration from rural communities to urban centers in search of employment.&#13;
3.   In areas such as Puno, which has a very fragile natural resource base, the effects of the&#13;
drought had consequences for several years, with the lack of seed for sowing, and the slow&#13;
recuperation of animal herds.&#13;
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DROUGHT AREA&#13;
4.    The Government's emergency program for drought areas covers seven departments,&#13;
naamely, Apurimac, Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cusco, Moquegua, Puno, and Tacna. Social and&#13;
production data for Puno, are shown in Table 1, which is the department most likely to be&#13;
affected by the drought and in which much of the Govemment's drought prevention and&#13;
alleviation program is focused.&#13;
5.    The sector is dominated by minifundio and low levels of productivity. Farms are&#13;
segmented and highly dispersed. For example, it is not unusual that a farmer may have two&#13;
hectares of crops which are divided into ten different units, and scattered throughout his&#13;
community. Availability of working capital is scarce and this has been one of the principal factors&#13;
why irrigation schemes have not prospered. It is also a principal reason why the farming&#13;
community cannot develop preventive measures to combat the expected drought due to the El&#13;
Nino phenomenon, and why the government has to step in with temporary measures to produce&#13;
forage in these irrigated areas.&#13;
&#13;

6.    The principal activity is livestock production, the main products being milk, meat, and&#13;
wool (both sheep and alpaca). Pasture production is mainly in rainfed areas, and is based on low&#13;
yielding native pasture. Crop production is almost entirely at subsistence levels and is&#13;
characterized by extremely low productivity levels (yields/ha).&#13;
THE PROPOSED DROUGHT EMERGENCY PREVENTION PROGRAM&#13;
7.    Because of the lack of capacity of the minifundio to embark on a program of emergency&#13;
measures to combat the expected drought, for the reasons given above, it is necessary for the&#13;
government to initiate a series of short term activities to alleviate the possible effects of the&#13;
drought. It is important to understand that these are stop gap measures, and until a coherent&#13;
strategy is developed for agriculture in the Altiplano and Sierra Sur, in which the roles of State&#13;
and private sector are clearly defined, and appropriate policies put in place, emergencies such as&#13;
this will continue to be the responsibility of the government. It is important therefore that in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
agricultural sector study being prepared by the GOP and the World Bank, these drought affected&#13;
areas receive due attention.&#13;
8.    The following activities are proposed for financing;&#13;
(a)   the rehabilitation of existing wells and irrigation systems;&#13;
(b)   a forage production program; and&#13;
(c)   a seed production program.&#13;
(a) Rehabilitation of Existing Wells and Irrigation Systems.&#13;
9.    As a drought prevention measure in the Sierra Sur, it is necessary to ensure that existing&#13;
water resources are operative for human and animal consumption and where possible for small&#13;
irrigation systems.&#13;
10.   Rehabilitation of deep tubular wells. In the department of Puno, there are a series of&#13;
deep tubular wells that are not functioning for various reasons, among which are lack of&#13;
maintenance and the lack of appropriate equipment. Such wells can be rehabilitated, and used for&#13;
irrigation purposes on small areas. Of the 100 existing wells only 25 are now operational and the&#13;
remaining 75 need to be made operational. These wells vary in depth from 30 to 80 meters and&#13;
have a capacity of between 25 and 45 liters per second. The rehabilitation of these well will be&#13;
carried out by the Instituto Nacional de Recursos Naturales (INRENA) and the Programa de&#13;
Aguas Subterrdneasy Tecnificaci6n de Riego (PRASTER), which are local agencies. Both&#13;
agencies are now working on drought prevention measures in Puno in collaboration with the&#13;
Comites de Regantes of each of the wells under repair. The distribution of the work and the&#13;
budget are presented in Table 2. Among the activities to be financed are cleaning of the existing&#13;
wells, repairs and replacement of pumps, and tests for pump capacity and quality of water.&#13;

11.   Rehabilitation of Small Wells. Also in the department of Puno, there are a series of&#13;
shallow wells which can be used for human and animal consumption. These need to be equipped&#13;
and made functional. This sub-component will rehabilitate existing wells and install 3500 manual&#13;
pumps throughout the department of Puno. It is estimated that the cost of rehabilitating and&#13;
installing each pump will be US$225. The work is already being carried out by the Direccion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

12.   Rehabilitation of Existing Irrigation Infrastructure. Throughout the Sierra Sur there&#13;
exist several irrigation systems that are not fully operational for the following reasons; incomplete&#13;
works such as lateral canals, deterioration and lack of maintenance. In some cases these problems&#13;
are exacerbated by the lack of credit for farmers to fully exploit the installed irrigation system,&#13;
and the absence of effective user organizations. PRONAMACH has already started on the&#13;
rehabilitation of a number of these irrigation schemes throughout the Sierra Sur as part of its&#13;
drought prevention work. This work covers 94 irrigation projects spread throughout the 7&#13;
departments that have been declared in a state of emergency. This sub-component is summarized&#13;
in Table 4.&#13;

(b) Forage Production Program&#13;
13.   One of the most devastating effects of the major drought of 1982-83, which coincided&#13;
with the El Nifno phenomenon, was the forced sale of livestock and the slow recuperation of the&#13;
herd because of the lack of forage. Because of the lack of capital in the minifundio in the irrigated&#13;
areas, farmers are not in a position to embark on a new forage program and the experience of&#13;
1982-83 is likely to be repeated in the event of a drought.&#13;
14.   Therefore as a prevention measure, the Ministry of Agriculture has embarked on a forage&#13;
production program in the irrigated areas of Puno. The program is being coordinated in the field&#13;
by the Insfituto Nacional de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) and is being implemented by&#13;
various government agencies in collaboration with farmers in the existing irrigation schemes. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
strategy being implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture is to sow annual forage crops such as&#13;
barley and oats along with a small amount of perennial pastures. The agreement between the&#13;
Ministry and the farmers stipulates that the harvest will be divided in equal parts between the&#13;
parties. It is estimated that under irrigation yields of green forage can reach 30 tons/hectare. The&#13;
total projected harvest is calculated to provide forage for the equivalent of 50,000 cattle or&#13;
300,000 sheep, or 200,000 camelids for a period of seven months which are estimated to be&#13;
period of severe shortages of forage in the case of a drought. The areas selected and the crops&#13;
being sown are shown in Table 5.&#13;
15.   The program was reviewed in the week of October 13, 1997. About 2,000 hectares have&#13;
been ploughed and about 500 hectares have been sown to oats and barley. It is planned that&#13;
sowing should be finished by December 31. The Ministry of Agriculture has bought 100 new&#13;
tractors to complete this task. At the moment, about 72 tractors are filly operational. The other&#13;
tractors are not filly equipped as yet.&#13;
16.   The project was judged to be technically feasible, since the soils on which the project is&#13;
planned are relatively productive if irrigation is assured. Other aspects of the technology package&#13;
to be applied i.e. crops, varieties, fertilizer, seeding density etc. are also thought to be adequate.&#13;
However, the mission had misgivings as to the logistical scale of the activity, and has&#13;
recommended and agreed with the Ministry of Agriculture to cut back the area sown from the&#13;
planned 20,000 hectares to 10,000 hectares. It was felt that the quality of the work could not be&#13;
assured on the bigger area.&#13;

(c) Seed Production Program&#13;
17.     Based on the experience ofthe 1982-83 drought and other drought hit areas around the&#13;
world the rate of recuperation of crop production is slow. One of the ingredients in hastening this&#13;
recuperation is an ample supply of good quality seed for the subsequent sowing season. For such&#13;
an eventuality, a seed production program needs to be put in place immediately. Such a seed&#13;
production program would consist of crops that provide the basic foods and forage for the area,&#13;
namely, potatoes, quinua, canihua, barley, oats, faba beans and tarwi.&#13;
18. This program would be implemented by INIA, and the Universidad Nacional Agraria&#13;
(IJNA) which have as a main part of their research strategy to provide seed for the basic food&#13;
crops of Peru. Sowing was starting in October 1997. It is proposed to finance the sowing of&#13;

Environmental Impact&#13;
19.   The overall environmental impact of this operation should be positive. The rehabilitation&#13;
of the irrigation schemes is in areas that have sufficient water resources and will not put extra&#13;
pressure on the existing water resources. Moreover, increased productivity in the irrigation&#13;
schemes should reduce farming pressure on more fragile environments such as hillsides.&#13;
Likewise, the forage production program will be conducted on stable soils, in irrigated areas. The&#13;
pesticides that will be used will be herbicides, and will be used in doses that are recommended for&#13;
efficient use. Increased forage production will alleviate the effects of overgrazing in more fragile&#13;
environments during the drought period. The rural public works program will be geared&#13;
specifically towards those works that preserve the natural resource base, such as the repair of&#13;
terraces and the improvement of rainfall infiltration.&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
20.   All of the activities that are proposed for financing in this drought component for the&#13;
Sierra Sur, are designed with the long term sustainability of the agricultural system and its natural&#13;
resource base in mind. The repair of the irrigation systems should improve productivity on the&#13;
more stable soils and relieve the pressure on the more fragile hillside soils. These works should&#13;
also improve the efficiency of existing water resources. The forage production program will&#13;
allow farmers to maintain their herds and therefore avoid their forced sale and subsequent&#13;
deterioration. This forage program should also mitigate the effects of overgrazing in the event of&#13;
a drought and the subsequent deserfification which is a latent problem in the Altiplano. The seeds&#13;
program will bring new seeds to the agricultural system, which should result in stable yields. The&#13;
rural public works program is oriented in its entirety to stabilizing the soil resources of the&#13;
hillsides with its emphasis on repair and building of terraces, and the construction of infiltration&#13;
canals.&#13;

APPENDIX 4&#13;
PREPARATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE DISASTER FORECASTING.&#13;
PREVENTION. RELIEF AND MITIGATION STRATEGY&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
There are, at present, many public sector agencies and NGOs involved in one way or&#13;
another, and with varying degrees of efficiency, in disaster forecasting, mitigation, prevention,&#13;
monitoring and relief There does not appear to exist, however, a clear-cut, comprehensive&#13;
strategy and institutional setup in this regard. As a result, there is not one single top-level&#13;
institution which, cutting across sectors, would be effectively responsible for designing and&#13;
implementing disaster-related activities. The actual roles of the different public sector agencies&#13;
are sometimes parallel or overlap with each other, and do not necessarily reflect their legal&#13;
mandates. And the relationship between the public sector agencies and NGOs is not always as&#13;
effective as would be desirable, even though it would be important for Government to avail itself&#13;
of the skills and experience that some NGOs have amassed over time, as well as their close&#13;
contacts with local populations. This sub-component will help the GOP design a comprehensive&#13;
strategy for disaster forecasting and management.&#13;
The objectives of this study are:&#13;
(a)    To evaluate existing institutions and current practices in disaster forecasting,&#13;
prevention, mitigation, monitoring and relief in Peru,&#13;
(b)   To compare the existing situation in Peru against worldwide best practice, and&#13;
(c)   To recommend a comprehensive strategy for eventual adoption by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
Methodology.&#13;
(1)   The consultant will identify all the institutions that currently play a significant role in&#13;
disaster forecasting, prevention, mitigation, monitoring and relief in Peru. These institutions may&#13;
be public sector agencies °, non-governmental organizations" or private sector entities .&#13;
10 For instance, the Instituto Geoflsico del Peri (IGP), the Servicio Nacional de Meteorologla e Hidrologia&#13;
(SENAMI), the Insfituto Nacional de Defensa Civil (INDECI), the Instituto del Mar del Pera} (MARPE),&#13;
the Consejos Transitorios de Administraci6n Regional (CTARs) and/or other authorities at the regional level,&#13;
the municipalites, the districts, the Comites de Emergencia, Colegio de Ingenieros del PerM, Colegio de&#13;
Arquitectos del Perm, public universities.&#13;
For instance, the PREDES, rTDG, Cruz Roja Peruana, Caritas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
The consultant will meet with managers and/or staff of each one of these institutions,&#13;
collect and fully familiarize her/himself with relevant written information.&#13;
The consultant will prepare a descriptive inventory (diagnostic) of each one of those&#13;
institutions, identify their specific institutional objectives (in connection with disaster forecasting,&#13;
prevention, mitigation and relief), and ascertain the actual experience each one of them has had in&#13;
these four "aspects'13 in connection with recent disasters, particularly since the early 1980's.&#13;
The consultant will also ascertain, for each institution, the resources available to them to&#13;
carry out its tasks, and the efficiency (cost-effectiveness) with which they use resources in order&#13;
to attain their stated objectives.&#13;
The consultant will actively seek to understand, for each institution, exactly: (a) what and&#13;
how it is supposed to do according to its written mandate; (b) what and how it actually does --&#13;
which may or may not be fully consistent with its written mandate; (c) which of its activities&#13;
overlap, duplicate or are in conflict, with those of other institutions; and (d) any relevant&#13;
constraints, institutional or other, under which it operates.&#13;
(2)    The consultant will carry out a comparison between the institutional setup and practices&#13;
currently existing in Peru and the best practice available elsewhere in the world. The consultant&#13;
will ensure that comparisons are based on facts and clear evidence.&#13;
(3)    The consultant will submit an interim report on her/his findings resulting from steps (1)&#13;
and (2). The purpose of this interim report would be to elicit Government's views and reactions&#13;
before going ahead with the next and final step of the process.&#13;
(4)    The consultant will prepare action-oriented recommendations for submission to&#13;
Government. The recommendations will be formulated in a manner that makes them amenable to&#13;
discussion, debate and decision making within Government with a view to their eventual adoption&#13;
as Government's own comprehensive strategy for disaster forecasting and management.&#13;
In preparing her/his recommendation, the consultant will keep in mind a number of&#13;
important considerations:&#13;
(a)    the consultant should indicate how the recommended institutional setup will ensure&#13;
that there will be an effective authority that will be able to carry out disaster-&#13;
related activities across sectors, regions and levels of government;&#13;
(b)    the amount of recommended institutional restructuring and inevitable dislocation&#13;
will be kept to a minimum;&#13;
12For instance, private universities, private insurance industry.&#13;
13 As part of the review of prevention and mitigation activities, the consultant will take a look at institutions&#13;
responsible for preparing, and recommending adoption of, building codes (use of hazard resistant building&#13;
techniques and standards this is particularly relevant in a country like Peru with significant frequency of&#13;
seismic phenomena), and regulations regarding prudent land use planning (particularly in flood-prone&#13;
measures).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49 -&#13;
(c)   where applicable, recommendations will be clearly labeled as short-term, medium-&#13;
term or long-term;&#13;
(d)   it would be important to clearly identify areas where cost effectiveness and&#13;
institutional efficiency and coordination may be improved;&#13;
(e)   resource requirements, for start up and on a recurrent basis, will be identified;&#13;
(f)   if, as is likely to happen, the consultant calls for the private sector, local&#13;
communities and NGOs to play a role in disaster management, the&#13;
recommendations should elaborate on the modalities under which they will&#13;
coordinate with public sector agencies; and&#13;
(g)   specialized skllls requirements in disaster forecasting, prevention, mitigation,&#13;
monitoring and relief will be identified, and training programs will be proposed.&#13;
Oualifications of the consultant.&#13;
The consultant should be familiar with best practice worldwide in the area of disaster&#13;
forecasting, prevention, mitigation and relief. The consultant should be fluent in Spanish and have&#13;
an adequate knowledge of the South American context.&#13;
&#13;

APPENDIX 5&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING AND CAPACITY BUILDING&#13;
1.    This sub-component aims to strengthen the capacity of Peruvian institutions responsible&#13;
for collecting data, predicting, monitoring, and better responding to future El Ni o episodes. In&#13;
contrast with the emergency nature of this operation, this component is expected to increase the&#13;
likely long-term, sustainable impact of Bank involvement.&#13;
2.    In consultation with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, four institutions have been&#13;
targeted to receive support under this component. All of them are statutory members of the&#13;
"Estudio Regional del Fen6meno de El Nino" (ERFEN), which was established by the            k&#13;
intergovernmental Comision Permanente del Pacifico Sur, and was recently ratified by GOP.&#13;
The four institutions, which are responsible for a wide range of activities, include: Instituto&#13;
Geofisico del Peru (IGP), Instituto del Mar del Perui (IMARPE), Instituto Nacional de Defensa&#13;
Civil (INDECI), and Servicio Nacional de Metereologia e Hidrologia (SENAMII). Bank&#13;
financing will be used to procure data collection and processing equipment, specialized foreign&#13;
technical assistance, and training. The following is a summary of the proposals presented by these&#13;
entities:&#13;
3.    Instituto Geofisico del Perui This sub-component would help the Instituto Geofisico del&#13;
Peru (IGP) strengthen Peru's capacity to forecast climate changes, including El Nirio. In order to&#13;
do this, IGP aims to use free-of-charge models recently developed by the scientific community&#13;
worldwide (including the USA's National Center for Atmospheric Research) as inputs to regional&#13;
models of climate change and to high-resolution models of sea surface temperature prediction off&#13;
the Peruvian coast. Other inputs required in this regard include real-time parameters of Peru's&#13;
atmosphere and coastal ocean which would be collected by automatic instrument platforms as&#13;
well as manual measuring operations. These will also provide the basis for short and long-term&#13;
weather forecasting.&#13;
4.    IGP would be responsible for the execution of this sub-component and may choose to&#13;
enter into specific "sub-contracting" agreements with two institutions with which it already has&#13;
entered into broad collaboration agreements, namely, the Universidad de Piura (UdeP) and the&#13;
Direcci6n de Hidrografiay Navegaci6n (DHN). Similarly, it may also choose to enter into an&#13;
agreement with the Instituto del Mar del Perui (IMARPE). Among other things, the above-&#13;
mentioned sub-contracting agreements would have to specify the responsibilities of the&#13;
subcontractors but clearly indicate that the IGP retains full responsibility for sub-component&#13;
implementation.&#13;
5.    Among other things, IGP would ask: (a) DHN, and probably IMARPE, to maintain and&#13;
operate maritime and coastal instruments; and (b) UdeP to build and, with DHN's assistance,&#13;
operate a wind profiler, a sea-state radar in Lobos de Afuera island, and a boundary layer radar.&#13;
6.    Regional forecasts would be made available to the Instituto de Defensa Civil (INDECI),&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Fisheries and the general public via Internet. Real-&#13;
time observations of the atmosphere will be shared with SENAMHI. Ocean state parameters and&#13;
prediction will be made available to IMARPE.&#13;

8.   Instituto del Mar delPerui  The Instifuto del Mar del Perti (ARPE) is responsible for&#13;
continuously carrying out research and monitoring the impact that of several factors (such as&#13;
fishing intensity and climate changes) on the biomass off Peru's coast. This is very important in a&#13;
country where fishing represents a significant sector of the economy. This sub-component would&#13;
help IMARPE strengthen its operations. Financing requested, with notional estimates includes:&#13;

(iv)  Integrated coastal zones (30 person-days), estimated cost US$ 19,000,&#13;
including fee, subsistence and travel.&#13;
9.    Instituto Nacional de Defensa Civil. 5 The Instituto Nacional de Defensa Civil&#13;
(INDECI) is responsible for designing and implementing disaster prevention and relief activities in&#13;
Peru. It encourages the public and the private sector to carry out analyses of risks and&#13;
vulnerability, and aims to improve the availability of human and logistical resources nationwide.&#13;
Financing requested, with notional estimates includes,&#13;
(a)   Equipment needed to receive data from weather satellites (US$ 42,800), including&#13;

APPENDIX 6&#13;
RESETTLEMENT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The agreed objectives of the Project's resettlement operations are to remove people from&#13;
areas at risk of flooding and landslide, relocate them to environmentally and socially sustainable&#13;
settlements, and provide them opportunities to improve their standards of livelihood in the new&#13;
resettled locations.&#13;
The resettlement policy to be applied in the case of the above mentioned displacement of&#13;
population shall be consistent with the principles contained in the World Bank Operational&#13;
Directive 4.30 (Involuntary Resettlement) and the document entitled "LATEN Guidelines for&#13;
Review of Projects Where Resettlement Needs are Not Known in Detail at the Time of&#13;
Appraisal."&#13;
Policy Framework&#13;
The following would be some of the policies and elements of the resettlement operations:&#13;
(a)   Persons entitled to resettlement shall be those, regardless of tenure status, whose&#13;
houses and/or lands are in areas at risk of flooding or landslide and who appear on&#13;
the census of affected families conducted by COFOPRI and included in the&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan approved by the Bank;&#13;
(b)   All affected persons will be resettled at no cost to the affected family;&#13;
(c)   All affected persons will be provided a replacement house and plot better than or&#13;
equivalent to their previous house and lot (it is currently planned that this be a&#13;
house lot of about 120 square meters and a modular house of about 11 square&#13;
meters);&#13;
(d)   The resettlement areas will be provided with communal kitchens and latrines,&#13;
potable water standpipes, public lighting and access and internal roads, all in&#13;
adequate conditions of operation;&#13;
(e)   The affected persons will be promptly provided freehold titles to lots and houses&#13;
which will be recorded in the respective property registry at no cost to the affected&#13;
person;&#13;
(f)   Each affected person will have access to low-interest credit from the Borrower to&#13;
improve and/or expand their modular houses;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
(g)   All affected persons, and specifically those that are considered most vulnerable in&#13;
socioeconomic terms, such as female-headed households and ethnic minorities, will&#13;
be provided special assistance to increase their income-generating capacities;&#13;
(h)   All areas that are evacuated will be devoted to reforestation or other public uses in&#13;
order to prevent any further human settlement including invasion by squatters;&#13;
(i)    To the extent that affected persons to be resettled are squatters on public lands at&#13;
risk of flooding or landslide, compensation will be provided for loss of assets in the&#13;
form of replacement lot, modular house and basic infrastructure. In other cases,&#13;
lost assets will be valued at their replacement cost as to permit continuation of the&#13;
social and economic function they had before they were adversely affected.&#13;
Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
(1)   INDECI and the local governments will be responsible for the mobilization and physical&#13;
transfer of the affected people to resettlement sites. All logistical arrangements needed for timely&#13;
and orderly moving of such affected people and their belongings both before and during the&#13;
emergency rests with these local institutions.&#13;
(2)   Regional Governments will be responsible for the development of resettlement sites&#13;
including land leveling, survey and division into house plots, and installation of modular houses,&#13;
communal infrastructure and public services. For such purposes, such Regional Governments will&#13;
establish, and thereafter maintain, regional coordinating committees composed of representatives&#13;
of major line agencies of government, INDECI, non-governmental organizations and the private&#13;
sector to oversee and coordinate resettlement and reconstruction works.&#13;
(3)   COFOPRI (the Borrower's National Commission for Formalization of Informal&#13;
Properties) will be responsible for conducting and updating a census of the areas to be evacuated,&#13;
for assisting affected families to select plots acceptable to them, for issuing freehold title to house&#13;
plots and modular houses in resettlement areas, and for recording titles in the property registry.&#13;
To accomplish these tasks, COFOPRI will establish, and thereafter maintain, offices in each&#13;
department (departamento) staff with key professionals, including a civil engineer, a lawyer and&#13;
an administrative officer. In addition, COFOPRI will establish, and thereafter maintain, in each&#13;
department office a social work unit to provide social communications for all affected persons and&#13;
special assistance for vulnerable households to increase their income-earning capacities.&#13;
(4)   The 01 will be responsible for technical assistance and guidance to all entities and agencies&#13;
involved in the resettlement program, timely and efficient allocation of financial resources to&#13;
responsible agencies, ensuring timely delivery of social assessments, environmental audits and&#13;
environmental assessments necessary for detailed planning of the resettlement operations in&#13;
preparation for the Bank's no objection a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) containing site-specific&#13;
detailed plans and thereafter implementation of the RAP, monitoring performance of responsible&#13;
government agencies at all levels, and periodic reporting of results to the Borrower and the Bank.&#13;
For these purposes, the 01 will establish a Resettlement and Reconstruction Team composed of&#13;
an anthropologist/sociologist, social worker, civil engineer and an administrator all with prior&#13;
experience with resettlement operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Financing Arrangements&#13;
The total cost of the definitive resettlement operations in northern Peru is estimated&#13;
approximately to be US$ 28,805,000.&#13;
The Bank is requested to finance, through the loan: (a) institutional strengthening of the&#13;
01 as regarding environmental and resettlement operations as well as COFOPRI's departmental&#13;
offices, including contracting of technical teams and purchase of equipment and vehicles; (b)&#13;
studies to be performed by consultants in connection with environmental and resettlement&#13;
operations; and (c) basic infrastructure for the definitive resettlement areas. The estimated cost of&#13;
these elements of the project is US$ 18,780,000 (US$1,780,000 for institutional strengthening,&#13;
and studies and US$17,000,000 for infrastructure).&#13;
The Borrower will finance, out of its own resources the provision of replacement land and&#13;
houses, mobilization and transfer of population, public services such as education and health, and&#13;
all recurrent administrative, personnel, equipment and vehicle costs of government agencies and&#13;
institutions contributing to design and implementation of components of the resettlement&#13;
operation. The estimated cost of these elements of the project is US$10,025,00 (US$ 5,493,000&#13;
for land and housing, US$ 2,380 for public services, US$ 95,000 for transfer, and US$ 2,056,000&#13;
for administrative costs).&#13;

            Peru - El Nino Emergency Assistance Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The principal objectives of the El Nino
            Emergency Assistance Project are to (a) reduce the loss of
            human life and deterioration of living standards that may
            result from the floods and/or droughts caused by the 1997-98
            El Nino event; (b) minimize the loss of, or damage to,
            economic and social infrastructure that may result; and (c)
            enhance institutional capacity to forecast and respond to
            future El Nino phenomena. The operation's components
            are tied to three distinct phases - prevention, emergency,
            and reconstruction - and include an institutional
            strengthening component. The prevention phase consists of 1)
            flood construction measures on the northern coast, including
            river dredging, strengthening river defenses and bridges,
            clearing and building storm drainage canals in all areas,
            building temporary housing, and protecting archeological
            sites; and 2) drought mitigation measures in the Andean
            highlands including water management, producing forage for
            livestock, and a seed production program. The emergency
            phase provides limited support, to provide certain emergency
            requirements such as mobile bridge structures, plants, pumps
            and metallic protection structures. The reconstruction phase
            will likely rebuild key public infrastructure; resettle
            families in flood prone areas and equip them with
            infrastructure facilities and public services; and operate a
            labor-intensive rural works program. Institutional support
            consists of equipment, technical assistance, and training.
