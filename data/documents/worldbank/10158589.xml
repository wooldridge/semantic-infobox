Poor financial performance can mostly be               Even for indicators which are as fundamental&#13;
attributed to high levels of nonrevenue water          as coverage, no utility could provide data&#13;
(NRW) or low level of tariffs or to both. An           which could be labeled highly reliable, and&#13;
improvement in financial performance                   different methods have been adopted for&#13;
necessitates reduction in NRW to                       measurement. It is defined in terms of&#13;
acceptable levels and rationalization of the           percentage of the city covered by some&#13;
tariff structure.                                      utilities, whereas other utilities define&#13;

Most of the utilities, barring Bangalore and           covered with water supply pipelines. While&#13;

consumers on a flat rate basis. Thus, there is         reliability, neither is perceived to be highly&#13;
no link between consumption and the                    reliable. Moreover, the absence of standard&#13;

a volumetric system of charges will require            meaningful comparisons.&#13;
the utilities to develop a proper metering as&#13;
well as billing and collection system.                 In the case of some indicators, the issue of&#13;
                                                       reliability can be addressed by introducing&#13;
Data reliability issues                                minor infrastructure improvements. For&#13;
The reliability of data for key indicators is          instance, the production data from the three&#13;
low. None of the participating utilities has "A"       utilities ­ PHEO-BHU, Indore Municipal&#13;
category systems for measuring coverage,               Corporation (IMC) and RMC ­ are not reliable&#13;
metering and the number of hours of supply.            as they use methods such as rated capacity of&#13;
Three of the participating utilities do not have       pumps and their hours of operation to estimate&#13;
"A" category data systems even for                     the level of production. The mere introduction&#13;
measuring water produced.                              of flow meters will allow the utilities to measure&#13;
                                                       their production levels accurately.&#13;
The data collection systems vary across&#13;
utilities and are generally weak. As a result,         In the case of other indicators, greater effort&#13;
the data collected are not always reliable.            will be required on the part of the utilities. For&#13;
For instance, many cities do not have a                instance, the estimate of the NRW is as high&#13;
policy to install meters for all connections.          as 50 percent of the total water produced.&#13;
The proportion of metered connections                  But this estimate of NRW itself has low&#13;
varied from almost negligible metering in              reliability in the absence of large-scale&#13;
Indore to 95 percent metering in Hyderabad.            metering. Only two utilities, BWSSB and&#13;
In the absence of metering, no reliable                HMWSSB, pursue a policy of providing&#13;
estimate of consumption data is possible. In           meters to all direct service connections.&#13;
the case of utilities which had a high                 Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company&#13;
proportion of metered water consumption,               (JUSCO), which has only 0.5 percent of&#13;
the reliability of the data was not high, as           connections metered, uses intermediate level&#13;
meters were not tested regularly for                   meters to estimate the total consumption by&#13;

Performance measurement and benchmarking             The data provided by the utilities have been&#13;
would not be meaningful if the data collected        graded on a four-point scale A-D with grade&#13;
have gaps or are unreliable. Data                    A indicating the highest reliability and Grade&#13;
inadequacies result from the lack of                 D the least reliability. This scale devised by&#13;

                                                       Number of direct service connections&#13;
The discussion begins by stating for                   The population covered by direct&#13;
each indicator the reliability attached to             connections can be estimated by multiplying&#13;
the different methods adopted/deployed                 the total number of connections by the&#13;
by the utilities for measuring the                     normative assumptions of the number of&#13;
performance indicators.                                persons living per household. However, in&#13;
                                                       many Indian cities, the number of&#13;
Coverage                                               connections is not identical with the number&#13;

In most of the utilities covered in this study,        connection supplying water to multiple&#13;
&#13;
data on coverage were not easily available.            households, as in the case of multi-storied&#13;
&#13;
The problem of data availability exists at two         apartments or multiple families living in a&#13;

area. The population of the service area is            Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Dehradun,&#13;
&#13;
known only for the year in which the Census            Indore and Rajkot have used this method. It&#13;
&#13;
was conducted, that is, the year 2001.                 gives a reasonable estimate of the&#13;
&#13;
Utilities estimate the growth rate; this               population served by direct connections. It is&#13;
&#13;
estimate varies across departments in the              not accurate, as some connections would be&#13;
&#13;
same utility. Secondly, utilities find it difficult    serving multiple households. Thus, data&#13;
&#13;
to estimate the population covered by                  about the estimates of population covered by&#13;
&#13;
their services. To estimate the population             direct connections in these cities can be&#13;
&#13;
covered, three data points would                       assigned Grade B status.&#13;
&#13;
be required:&#13;
· Population covered by direct connections;            In other cases, especially in large&#13;
&#13;
· Population covered by public water                   metropolitan cities such as Bangalore,&#13;
&#13;
   points; and                                         Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune, application&#13;
&#13;
· Population covered by tankers.                       of this method would not be possible. These&#13;
                                                       cities are characterized by large-scale&#13;
In the long run, it is expected that the utility       vertical developments. For example, Indore&#13;
would attempt to shift all consumers to                with a population about two-thirds of the&#13;
&#13;
direct service connections. Therefore, it is           population of Pune has 50 percent more&#13;
&#13;
critical that the utility adopts a                     connections than Pune.&#13;
&#13;
methodology to measure coverage by&#13;
direct service connection as reliably as               Geographical coverage&#13;
&#13;
possible. The data on population, covered              Some cities provide estimates of population&#13;
&#13;
by public water points and tankers, can be             served by the geographical coverage of their&#13;
&#13;

the total service area. This is the simplest    methodology has been qualified as Grade&#13;
form of an estimate and suffers from several    D. Chennai had adopted this method to&#13;
approximations. The most common one is          estimate the coverage ratio.&#13;
that the population densities are not uniform&#13;
across a service area of the utility. The core  Property coverage&#13;
&#13;
area that is densely populated will most likely A correct way to estimate population&#13;
&#13;
have a water supply network. Newly              coverage would be to estimate the number&#13;
&#13;
developing peripheral areas will have a lower   of properties in the service area and the&#13;
&#13;
density and may not have a complete             number of properties provided with a direct&#13;
&#13;
network. Therefore, this method can             service connection. Thus, the ratio of the&#13;

introduce errors. Since this is the simplest    number of properties provided with direct&#13;
&#13;
form of an estimate, it is being categorized    service connection to the total number of&#13;
&#13;
as Grade D type data.                           properties in the service area would be a&#13;
                                                reliable estimate of the population covered&#13;
As a refinement of this method, some utilities  by direct service connections.&#13;
estimate the population that resides in the&#13;
geographical area covered by the network.       To follow this method, the utility would need&#13;

This is then divided by the total population of to have a database of the total number of&#13;

Utility Data Systems Analysis&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
In Bangalore, Chandigarh, Chennai, Dehradun,       The utility, which has all its connections&#13;
Hyderabad, Jamshedpur and Pune, the                metered, is placed in category Grade A. But&#13;
volume of water produced is accurately             none of the 10 utilities has adopted this&#13;
measured with the help of flow meters. Hence,      practice. At the second level, the utility may&#13;
the data from these cities have been placed in     not have all connections provided with&#13;
Grade A. In Indore and Rajkot, the                 meters, but can install meters at the next&#13;
methodology adopted has its own limitations        level of aggregation. For instance, the utility&#13;
as the efficiency of the pump or the treatment     may provide a meter at an appropriate&#13;
plant is difficult to estimate. The data provided  intermediate level in the distribution network.&#13;
by these utilities are accordingly placed in       This system would not be able to provide&#13;
Grade D. In Bhubaneswar, about half of the         consumption data at the consumer end, but&#13;
water produced is measured using flow              at least at a bulk level. The data collected&#13;

the measurement of the other half of water         Grade B. Bangalore, Chandigarh,&#13;
produced, prompts Bhubaneswar's placing in         and Hyderabad have been placed in&#13;
the Grade D category. Indore and Rajkot            this category.&#13;
estimate the volume of water produced using&#13;
the number of hours of pump operation and the      Jamshedpur makes up for the small number&#13;
&#13;
pump's rated capacity. The production data         of metered connections by installing meters&#13;
&#13;
provided by Indore and Rajkot are thus             at select intermediate distribution points to&#13;
&#13;

Grade A. These five cities segregate the               Grade C. Pune does not maintain data on&#13;
complaints into various categories based on            the number of complaints. Hence, Pune has&#13;

As mentioned in the earlier section, the cities                          grade below the best than that can be made&#13;
have adopted different methods to compute                                available. Only Chandigarh and Rajkot report&#13;
their service coverage ratios. The reliability of                        a good mix of high coverage and reliable&#13;
the data on service coverage varies for the                              data (Grade B). Chandigarh has reported the&#13;
different methods deployed by the utilities. In                          highest coverage at 100 percent followed by&#13;
the case of Bangalore, Chennai and                                       Rajkot at 98 percent. Bhubaneswar scores&#13;
Hyderabad, the water supply coverage is                                  low on coverage (45 percent) and high in&#13;
reported to be in excess of 90 percent. In the                           reliability of the data provided (Grade B).&#13;

service connections and public water points.                                 In Bhubaneswar, less than 1 percent of the&#13;
The Census 2001 estimation of six people                                     connections are metered. The metered water&#13;

7The estimate of coverage is based on the assessment of geographical areas covered by the sewerage network and hence is low on the reliability scale.&#13;
8Only about half of the production volumes are measured with the help of flow meters and hence the total production data have low reliability. In the&#13;
absence of large-scale metering, the consumption data have very low reliability.&#13;

serves 7.28 people. The Census data estimate 4.5 persons living per household and not 7.28 as assumed by MCC. Thus, MCC coverage data&#13;
maybe overstated and be low on reliability. Further, about 0.15 million customers have been covered by public water points. This number is&#13;
calculated by multiplying the number of public water points (1,200) by an estimated number of people being served per public water point (125).&#13;

12The production levels have been calculated based on flow meter readings made at all bulk production points and estimates of water supply from small&#13;
tube wells, hence the data reliability level is high. But due to limited metering, the reliability of consumption data is very poor. Accordingly, the UFW&#13;

Summary                                        percentage of water and sewerage&#13;
The service coverage for water supply is       connections has increased from 14 percent&#13;
estimated to be 95 percent and that for        in 2004 to 22 percent in 2006.&#13;
sewerage is estimated to be 65 percent of&#13;
the service area. The average hours of daily   HMWSSB also ranks high in terms of&#13;
supply in the best case is about 30-45         metering with 95 percent of the connections&#13;
minutes on alternate days. In 2006, there      metered but there is no proper record to&#13;
was a deterioration in the quality of water as ascertain the functionality of meters installed.&#13;
only 87 percent of the samples passed the      The proportion of NRW to the total water&#13;
test for residual chlorine. In other years,    produced is very high at 50 percent. During the&#13;
almost 97 percent of the samples passed        period 2004-06, water production increased by&#13;
this test. HMWSSB has probably the most        45 percent while consumption increased by&#13;
elaborate system for documenting               only 27 percent. This can also be observed&#13;
complaints received from its customers. The    from the fact that UFW as a percentage of&#13;
complaints are categorized into 24 different   water produced has increased from 42 percent&#13;
heads. The number of complaints as a           to 50 percent in the same period.&#13;

Coverage&#13;
JUSCO supplies water to its customers                                          Most of the water connections provided by&#13;
mainly through direct service connections                                      JUSCO are unmetered; a metering policy is&#13;
and public water points. In the event of                                       currently under formulation. In 2006, about&#13;

supplies water through tankers. Its water                                      metered, corresponding to 70 percent of the&#13;

This includes bulk industrial consumers and                                    industrial connections with bulk&#13;

service connections and public water points.                                   2.25 percent of the meters were recorded as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16As per JUSCO's definition of coverage, a person is considered `covered' by the water supply system if she/he is within easy access to water&#13;
services (either with direct service connection or within 200 m of a standpost or served by other sources of potable water provided by the utility, for&#13;
example, overhead storage or tanks).&#13;
17Both production and consumption data provided by JUSCO are fairly reliable. JUSCO has installed electromagnetic flow meters at all the water&#13;
treatment facilities to assess production levels. Meters installed at select public water points are used to measure the volume of water consumed&#13;
and these data are extrapolated to measure consumption levels at all public water points. JUSCO also measures losses in the conveyance system&#13;
through the electromagnetic flow meters installed at the abstraction, inlet and outlet of the treatment facilities. (With 1 percent consumption&#13;
metering, it is difficult to defend consumption data as reliable whatever aggregate/bulk metering one may do.)&#13;
18The production data presented here also include nonpotable industrial water supply.&#13;

19It may be noted that the reservoir levels are measured only at the end of the distribution cycle and not before the commencement of pumping.&#13;
This results in an error in assessing the supply/production levels, especially if the reservoir is not filled completely before the commencement of the&#13;
pumping process. Thus, the data reliability level for water production is very low. Due to very limited metering, the reliability of consumption data is&#13;
also very poor. Accordingly, the UFW/NRW estimates may be highly inaccurate.&#13;

                Legislature in 1964, by which it was made responsible for making provisions&#13;
                for water supply, sewerage and disposal of sewage in the Bangalore&#13;
                metropolitan area. Currently, the main focus of service of&#13;
                BWSSB is Bangalore. BWSSB is expected to progressively provide water&#13;
                and sewerage services to other parts of the Bangalore metropolitan area.&#13;
                BWSSB sources water mainly from two sources: the Cauvery (850 MLD)&#13;
                and Arkavathy (100 MLD), respectively. The Cauvery source is located&#13;
                about 100 km away from the city.&#13;

                      IMC is responsible for providing civic services in the city of Indore. Water&#13;
                      supply and sewerage is one the many services it provides to its citizens. The&#13;
                      PHED, a state government department, had been responsible for providing&#13;
                      water services to the city earlier. Currently, the employees of PHED, stationed&#13;
                      in Indore, are under the administrative control of IMC, but their salaries are still&#13;
                      paid by the state government. Besides, IMC has employees on its rolls who&#13;
                      are responsible for providing O&amp;M services other than operating the water&#13;
                      treatment plant. PHED is also responsible for providing O&amp;M services.&#13;
&#13;
                      IMC provides water supply to Indore city from two perennial sources ­ Yashwant&#13;
                      Sagar Dam on the Gambhir river (26 MLD) and Narmada river (180 MLD).&#13;
                      Besides, the rain-dependent Bilawali Tank (4 MLD) and ground water (13 MLD)&#13;
                      are the other two sources of water. Narmada river is at a distance of 70 km from&#13;
                      the city. But of the 180 MLD sourced, 140 MLD is supplied to Indore city while the&#13;
                      balance 40 MLD is sold en route to towns and villages.&#13;

  Institutionalizing Benchmarking&#13;
&#13;
  The Water and Sanitation Program­South               2006, in New Delhi. The roundtable&#13;
  Asia in partnership with the Ministry of             brought together city officials, experts and&#13;
  Urban Development, Government of India,              practitioners, to disseminate and discuss&#13;
  undertook a project on Benchmarking                  the results from the aforementioned&#13;
  Urban Water Utilities.                               initiatives and brainstorm on the&#13;
                                                       development of a common performance&#13;
  WSP-SA completed Phase I of the project              measurement framework for cities&#13;
  in 2005. Building on Phase I, the focus in           under the urban renewal mission.&#13;
  Phase II was to improve the quality of&#13;
  data, to highlight the information gaps,             In a significant outcome, Ministry of Urban&#13;
  and explore institutional mechanisms to              Development committed to institutionalize&#13;
  undertake performance benchmarking on                benchmarking by linking it to the urban&#13;
  a sustainable basis. As part of Phase II,            renewal mission and other centrally-&#13;
  data on water and sanitation services was            sponsored programs. The key issue being&#13;
  collected from ten Jawaharlal Nehru                  explored is the use of such a&#13;
  National Urban Renewal Mission                       benchmarking program to monitor and&#13;
  (JNNURM) cities and a detailed analysis              evaluate progress under the urban&#13;
  carried out to arrive at the performance             renewal mission in achieving urban water&#13;
  trends and data gaps.                                and sanitation services. As a preliminary&#13;
                                                       step, the Ministry constituted a Core Group&#13;
  To take forward the key messages from                on Benchmarking with a mandate to&#13;
  Phase I and Phase II, the Water and                  develop a framework of Service Level&#13;
  Sanitation Program-South Asia, in                    Benchmarks for water supply, wastewater&#13;
  collaboration with the Ministry of                   management, and solid waste&#13;
  Urban Development, the Institute of                  management. WSP-SA, alongwith CRISIL,&#13;
  Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI),               PROOF and ICAI, is working with the&#13;
  and PROOF organized a roundtable                     Ministry to finalizing this framework and is&#13;
  discussion on performance measurement                supporting adoption of the same at various&#13;

            Phase II : benchmarking urban water
            utilities in India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            sector in India suffers from chronic inefficiencies,
            including limited coverage and poor service quality. To
            address these shortcomings, the focus of interventions in
            the sector has predominantly been directed at the
            supply-side factors, such as capital investments the
            creation of infrastructure. This, however, has not resulted
            in improved service delivery. The weak service orientation
            is exacerbated by the lack of reliable information on the
            performance of utilities. This limits a utility's
            ability to understand and gauge its performance, and also
            constrains any inter-utility comparison. The second phase of
            benchmarking also focused on data collection systems
            prevailing in the utilities, and a multiyear analysis of
            performance. This report presents the findings of the data
            collection and analysis exercise as part of the second phase activity.
