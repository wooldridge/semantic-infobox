Produced by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Urban Development and Local Government Unit of the Sustainable&#13;
Development Network, the Urban Development Series discusses the challenge of urbanization and&#13;
what it will mean for developing countries in the decades ahead. The Series aims to explore and delve&#13;
more substantively into the core issues framed by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s 2009 Urban Strategy Systems&#13;
of Cities: Harnessing Urbanization for Growth and Poverty Alleviation. Across the ï¬?ve domains of&#13;
the Urban Strategy, the Series provides a focal point for publications that seek to foster a better&#13;
understanding of (i) the core elements of the city system, (ii) pro-poor policies, (iii) city economies,&#13;
(iv) urban land and housing markets, (v) sustainable urban environment, and other urban issues&#13;
germane to the urban development agenda for sustainable cities and communities.&#13;

                 The benefit transfer methodology is often used when         As noted earlier, the actual methodology that can be&#13;

                 The benefit transfer methodology will never yield           ex post cost-benefit analysis along the lines described&#13;
                 better estimates than original (primary) studies. How-      above. Nonetheless, a compilation of the types of in-&#13;

                 may be sufficient to make some decisions. If the origi-     useful picture of the projectâ&#128;&#153;s effects, assuming that&#13;
                 nal studies from which benefit or cost numbers are          data relating to at least the most important impacts&#13;

                 methodology will not yield reliable estimates of the        non-market benefits in the overall pattern of heritage&#13;
                 costs and benefits for the site under study. A key ob-      project impacts, particular attention should be paid&#13;

restoration of four pilot sites that were to serve as&#13;
prototypes for future cultural heritage investments&#13;
and public-private partnerships. The four pilot sites&#13;
were Old Town Tbilisi, Sighnaghi, Uplistsikhe, and&#13;
Shatili. Collectively these sites received US$1.9 mil-&#13;
lion. Of these four sites, it is Old Town Tbilisi that&#13;
contains the area of Kala that is the subject of this&#13;
evaluation (see figure 4.2).&#13;
&#13;
Targeted investments undertaken to revitalize Old&#13;
Town Tbilisi and preserve its architectural legacy&#13;
included funding to renovate historic buildings and&#13;
museums, restore facades, reset the cobblestone pave-&#13;
ment, install street lights, and landscape public parks.&#13;
By the end of the project, the conservation and res-&#13;

            Investment in urban heritage : economic
            impacts of cultural heritage projects in FYR Macedonia and Georgia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Although World Bank projects in the
            cultural heritage field are subject to the usual assessments
            that are applied to any project implementation, little is
            known about the subsequent performance of these projects in
            the years post-completion. This study was undertaken to
            provide some empirical evidence for the economic impacts of
            cultural heritage investment. Two case studies were chosen
            for this purpose, in the historic town centers of Skopje,
            former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Tbilisi, Georgia,
            respectively. The economic principles those are important
            for the analysis of cultural heritage investment decisions
            make use of concepts such as scarcity, opportunity cost, and
            public preferences. The study confirms the positive impacts
            of the investments. In the Macedonian case, the project
            helped to stimulate an ongoing investment of US$2.5 million
            in the project site, the Skopje old bazaar. Tourist numbers
            increased compared to the control site in Prilep; between
            2005 and 2010, daily tourist numbers in the Skopje Old
            Bazaar increased by 90 percent compared to a slight decline
            in Prelip. Employment also grew more rapidly in the target
            site than in the control area. This study leads to some
            lessons for the design of heritage projects and for the
            conduct of an ex post economic impact evaluation.
