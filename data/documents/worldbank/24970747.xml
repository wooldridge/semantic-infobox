Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between the Bank&#13;

equivalent) to the Trust Fund.&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1    The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee under&#13;
general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be considered a&#13;
waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of&#13;
which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time, including its&#13;
procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and combat&#13;
fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist&#13;
activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken&#13;
under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does&#13;
not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules&#13;
and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be commingled with&#13;
other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the "Holding&#13;
Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the Holding&#13;
Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall&#13;
convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate&#13;
fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;
may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their disbursement in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds administered by&#13;
the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund to be used for the same&#13;
purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿3.     Trust Fund Fees&#13;

equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions significantly differ from&#13;
what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration Agreement, or if other&#13;
circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the&#13;
terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions&#13;
that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors&#13;
under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;

of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a&#13;
combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion&#13;
thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4    If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's external&#13;
auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an external audit is&#13;
necessary. If such an audit is agreed to be necessary and if all donors to the Trust Fund concur with the relevant&#13;
Donor's request for such an audit, the Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for&#13;
such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such&#13;
audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits of the Bank's&#13;
applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be&#13;
borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial,&#13;
compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by September&#13;
30, 2021 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds deposited in the Trust Fund for&#13;
the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to the extent such&#13;
date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all the Donors.&#13;
Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each&#13;
Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata&#13;
basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited&#13;
in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;

that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the Bank and any consultants and/or&#13;
other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to&#13;
the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return to the Donor its pro-rata share in&#13;
the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement, unless otherwise agreed between the Bank&#13;
and the Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
