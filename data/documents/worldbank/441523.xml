Corporate Distress in East Asia&#13;
The effect of currency and interest rate shocks&#13;
Stijn Claessens,   This Note reports the results of a study that quantified the effect of currency and interest rate&#13;
end Giovanni       shocks in East Asia on the liquidity and solvency of nonfinancial corporations in the region. In a&#13;
and Giovanni&#13;
Fenri              survey of the five countries most affected by the East Asian financial crisis-Indonesia, the&#13;
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand-the study found that 63 percent of&#13;
firms are illiquid (with earnings less than their debt service) and 31 percent technically insolvent&#13;
(with financial obligations exceeding their equity).' Among solvent firms, about half are illiquid&#13;
and at risk of insolvency unless their liquidity constraints are relieved. Worst affected is&#13;
Indonesia, with 77 percent of firms illiquid (table 1). Malaysia has the fewest insolvent firms-&#13;
5 percent-but even so, 63 percent of firms are illiquid. Nonperforming loans in the five countries&#13;
could amount to 7 to 30 percent of GDP, and the share of nonperforming assets could be as high&#13;
as 64 percent of GDP in Korea, and more than a third of the combined GDP in these countries.&#13;
The study also sheds light on the high interest rate debate for each country. There is a clear&#13;
tradeoff: higher interest rates will damage profits but could help to stabilize the currency, thus&#13;
limiting the burden of external liabilities.&#13;

            Corporate distress in East Asia : the
            effect of currency and interest rate shocks
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A study of the five countries most
            affected by the East Asian financial crisis - Indonesia, the
            Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand
            -- shows that more than 60 percent of firms are illiquid and
            30 percent are technically insolvent. Among solvent firms,
            about half are at risk of insolvency unless their liquidity
            constraints are relieved. Worst affected is Indonesia, with
            77 percent of firms illiquid and 65 percent insolvent,
            followed by Korea and Thailand. Extrapolations using these
            findings suggest that non-performing loans in the five
            countries could amount to 7 to 30 percent of Gross Domestic
            Product (GDP) and non-performing assets to more than a third
            of their combined GDP.
