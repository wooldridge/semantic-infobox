1. SECONDARY EDUCATION AND TEACHER DEVELOPMENT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
Project Context&#13;
1.1      Over the last 25 years, Indonesia has focused on increasing access to educational&#13;
opportunities. As a result, from 1969 to 1994, the participation rates in junior secondary edu-&#13;
cation (grades 7-9, SMP) increased from 15 percent to 54 percent, and in senior secondary&#13;
education (grades 10-12, SMA) from 9 percent to 34 percent. Currently, about 28,600 secon-&#13;
dary schools enroll about 11.3 million students, 56 percent boys and 44 percent girls. Most of&#13;
the junior secondary schools offer the general education curriculum; about one-third of the&#13;
senior secondary schools offer specialized curricula in home economics and in vocational-&#13;
technical education. Private schools enroll about one-third of all junior secondary students&#13;
and more than half of the senior secondary student population. About 1.6 million students&#13;
attend Islamic schools.&#13;
1.2       REPELITA VI (the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, 1994-1999) stipulates&#13;
the following education strategies: (i) improving access and equity to education for every per-&#13;
son; (ii) strengthening linkages among educational inputs, processes, and products to ensure&#13;
relevance and quality; and (iii) budgeting more efficiently and making greater use of trained&#13;
staff. In pursuit of those strategies, the Government has started implementing an obligatory&#13;
nine years of basic education (i.e., six years of primary education and three years of SMP) as&#13;
well as programs to improve the quality of education. In addition to expanding enrollments in&#13;
existing schools, education would be delivered to difficult-to-reach areas through innovative&#13;
means. This includes organizing small schools (SMP keci!) in remote locations with fewer&#13;
teachers but flexible teaching assignments and transmitting secondary education lessons to&#13;
working people in widely dispersed locations through the various media of distance education&#13;
(SMP terbuka, "open SMP"). The coverage of secondary education, especially at the junior&#13;
level, is expected to expand significantly as a result. Qualified teachers will be in demand to&#13;
train the new generation of better skilled workers needed by the rapidly growing economy.&#13;
1.3      In quantitative terms, the teacher training system has the capacity to produce the&#13;
secondary school teachers to meet the needs of the expansion. However, the system as a&#13;
whole suffers from inefficiency, and the individual training institutions suffer from qual-&#13;
ity deficiencies--these limit the gains to society from an expanded secondary education&#13;
system. A project to improve teacher education would have significant benefits. First,&#13;
LPTKs would improve their efficiency by upgrading their program content, qualifications and&#13;
effectiveness of staff, facilities, and linkages with the schools they serve. Second, LPTKs will&#13;
then become more cost-effective as they use their resources more efficiently. Further, the&#13;
benefits of the improved institutions would extend to the new secondary school teachers&#13;
(about 25,000 yearly) who would be reached by the project, and the secondary school stu-&#13;
dents taught by those teachers (about two million yearly).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2            Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
The Existing Teacher Training System&#13;
1.4      There are three types of public LPTKs: the institute with education and other&#13;
faculty departments (IKIP), the institute with an education faculty department only (STKIP),&#13;
and the education faculty affiliated with a university (FKIP). The institutions vary by owner-&#13;
ship (public, private), size, location, quality, and other characteristics (Annexes 2 and 3). The&#13;
31 public LPTKs, consist of 10 IKIPs and two STKIPs located in urban centers and 19 FKIPs&#13;
located in rural areas. Together these public institutions produced approximately 20,000&#13;
teacher in 1994 and are the largest providers of secondary school teachers. The public LPTKs&#13;
are superior to their private counterparts in facilities, funding and public perception. IKIP&#13;
Bandung, the nearest to Jakarta, has a large faculty and student body and is known as the&#13;
center for mathematics and science education. STKIP Singaraja in Bali is small but has close&#13;
links to local secondary schools. The 211 private LPTKs are of uneven quality and produced&#13;
24,000 graduates in 1994. Their graduates compete with the public LPTKs for teaching posi-&#13;
tions in public secondary schools (Annex 4).&#13;
1.5      LPTKs are considered an integral part of a higher education system which itself is&#13;
changing. A newly created Higher Education Strategy Commission is addressing key issues&#13;
such as low staff motivation and morale, inefficient utilization of existing resources, and sys-&#13;
temic rigidity. Four elements would constitute the cornerstones of the emerging reform: (i)&#13;
institutional autonomy, (ii) accountability, (iii) accreditation, and (iv) evaluation. Projects&#13;
following this "new paradigm" for higher education are being developed (some of them for&#13;
World Bank financing), which would affect both public and private LPTKs. Tertiary institu-&#13;
tions will become subject to accreditation based on a self-evaluation process, and competi-&#13;
tion for resources will gradually be introduced. A semiautonomous National Accreditation&#13;
Board (BAN) has been established, and the Higher Education Council, chaired by the Direc-&#13;
tor-General of Higher Education, will be established in 1996 to take charge of higher educa-&#13;
tion policy formulation and budget allocation.&#13;
B. MAJOR ISSUES IN SECONDARY TEACHER EDUCATION&#13;
Efficiency Issues&#13;
1.6      Overstaffing at LPTKs. Although the Government has embarked on a "zero&#13;
growth" policy in the public sector, the education sector has been spared, and 25,000 teaching&#13;
positions were approved for 1996, including 8,000 new positions. The Directorate-General of&#13;
Higher Education (DGHE) has generally maintained zero growth in LPTK staffing, canceling&#13;
programs of study where enrollments no longer warrant their existence. (On exception, new&#13;
faculty are recruited from among university graduates, to strengthen subject content knowl-&#13;
edge, especially in mathematics and science.) Nonetheless, certain public IKIPs are over-&#13;
staffed. When study programs have been eliminated for lack of student demand, the resulting&#13;
excess teaching staff, enjoying civil service status, are kept on the payroll to share teaching&#13;
loads with others or to do other academic work. This has resulted in a low student-teacher&#13;
average ratio of 9.9:1 for public LPTKs, a figure that masks wide variations, from 4:1 at&#13;
STKIP Gorontalo to 12:1 at IKIP Jakarta. Raising the ratio to 12:1, the current student-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                            3&#13;
teacher ratio at universities, would free up to 2,400 lecturers who would then have no teach-&#13;
ing assignment and would be available for reassignment.&#13;
1.7       Limited access to inservice training. The upgrading of teachers to SI level&#13;
through various inservice training programs, including those offered by the Open University&#13;
(Universitas Terbuka, UT), is in need of support. During the period of rapid expansion of sec-&#13;
ondary education in the 1970s and 1980s, diploma programs and crash courses were opened by the&#13;
Government in order to overcome teacher shortages. As a result, about three-quarters of the jun-&#13;
ior secondary and more than half of the senior secondary school teachers are underqualified&#13;
because the minimum qualification for secondary school teachers today is an SI (bachelor's)&#13;
degree (Annex 1). While LPTKs have been commissioned since 1992 to provide three-year post&#13;
secondary diploma (D-III) upgrading courses for junior secondary teachers, less is being done for&#13;
the upgrading of teacher qualification from D-III to SI. Various universities are now offering ex-&#13;
tension courses to allow for S I upgrading, which the teachers pay for themselves. Since these pro-&#13;
grams require fees and are campus-based (except for the bachelor-level students at UT) teachers&#13;
who work in outlying areas or who cannot afford the fees are unable to participate. In addition,&#13;
many of the self-instructional modules for the upgrading programs were produced quickly and not&#13;
field-tested, so there are doubts about quality and effectiveness. By this standard, a fair sized in-&#13;
service program will be required to upgrade these teachers under the new standards in order&#13;
not to lose the investments already made on these individuals.&#13;
Institutional Quality Issues&#13;
1.8       Underqualified faculty. LPTK faculty qualifications are generally low. To meet&#13;
the demands for teaching staff in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the LPTKs recruited new&#13;
faculty members directly from their own graduating classes with the Sl degree. As a result,&#13;
only 23 percent of the LPTK teaching staff have the S2 (master's) or S3 degree (doctorate),&#13;
and many lecturers have no classroom teaching experience in secondary schools. While fac-&#13;
ulty at U.S. teacher education institutions typically hold the S3 degree, the current Indonesian&#13;
objective is to achieve the S2 qualification for at least 50 percent of all faculty at tertiary level&#13;
institutions. Fellowship programs have already been put in place, and taking into account&#13;
those currently taking graduate studies, the proportion would increase to 37 percent (Annex&#13;
5).&#13;
1.9        The teacher educators themselves need help to improve their subject-specific&#13;
pedagogical knowledge and skills. Under the current LPTK curriculum, the subject-education&#13;
courses are too general and do not sufficiently address the question of how to teach specific&#13;
concepts and skills, and how to assess and provide feedback to students. The links among&#13;
LPTKs are weak, and LPTK links with international teacher education institutions are few.&#13;
1.10      Rigid preservice curriculum. The SI curriculum needs improvements in scope,&#13;
quality, and relevance to local teaching situations, especially at the junior secondary level.&#13;
Through the Basic Science Team (BST) composed of educators from the Bandung Institute of&#13;
Technology and IKIP Bandung, efforts began in 1989 to strengthen subject matter content&#13;
courses in mathematics and science teacher education programs. Similar efforts are needed&#13;
for the other subject areas. Further, LPTK students graduate with a major in the one subject&#13;
content area that they would teach in school; however, those SMPs with small enrollments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4            Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
need teachers who can teach more than one subject (horizontal flexibility). In 1992, some&#13;
LPTKs have begun experimenting with a curriculum that would allow the graduates to teach&#13;
at both SMP and SMAs (vertical flexibility), an initiative that needs support. In the area of&#13;
pedagogy, the current courses are oriented toward the senior secondary students, ignoring the&#13;
pedagogy needs of early adolescents, which are different.&#13;
1.11     Facilities not up to standard. Equipment for the teaching of mathematics and&#13;
science subjects are inadequate. Measured against the minimum standard for equipment set&#13;
by the BST for teaching the mathematics and science curricula (para. 3.4), there is wide&#13;
variation among the institutions in the supply and quality of equipment as well as storage fa-&#13;
cilities, maintenance capacity, and general condition of laboratories. Because training and&#13;
guidance are inadequate, the available equipment are often underutilized and inappropriately&#13;
maintained.&#13;
1.12     Reference and other library books at LPTKs are out of date. Many of the titles&#13;
purchased under the Second Teacher Training Project (Loan 2101 -IND), completed in 1990,&#13;
are at least five years old. The writing and translating of key works in education to Bahasa&#13;
Indonesia is needed to give teacher educators and trainees, most of whom cannot read foreign&#13;
languages, a wider access to new materials. Moreover, teacher educators do not have access&#13;
to the textbooks, teachers' manuals, and curriculum guides currently used in secondary&#13;
schools, leaving them out of touch with the national curriculum as it is applied in the class-&#13;
room.&#13;
1.13     Faculty offices are crowded or lacking altogether. In many IKIPs, as many as 20&#13;
lecturers share a single room. There is insufficient space to provide them with their own desks&#13;
where they can prepare their lessons or counsel their students. There is rarely any space avail-&#13;
able for staff meetings or for group discussions with students. Such conditions work against&#13;
instilling professionalism among faculty, collegiality, and commitment to their home institu-&#13;
tion.&#13;
1.14     LPTKs uninformed of their "market." Research on effective schools show the&#13;
importance of a supportive and cooperative relationship between the teacher training institu-&#13;
tion and the schools it serves. Currently, Indonesian teacher education programs do not em-&#13;
phasize exchanges between schools and LPTKs. Often, teacher trainees are trained without a&#13;
concrete understanding of what happens in schools on a day-to-day basis. For example, train-&#13;
ees have very little guidance during teaching practicum, and little opportunity for spending&#13;
time observing or researching in schools. International studies have shown that essential&#13;
changes in the performance of student teachers occur from week 8 to week 10, a finding that&#13;
supports the need for a minimum of one semester for the student teaching experience. The&#13;
current training context is not conducive to producing proficient trainees who identify&#13;
strongly as teachers and have a solid, practical command of their profession.&#13;
1.15     Inadequate preparation of teacher candidates. The higher education entrance&#13;
examination scores indicate that a great number of the LPTK recruits have not mastered the&#13;
secondary school course content. It is well established that the entry-level characteristics of&#13;
students are critical to their future learning. LPTKs, however, rarely develop an understanding&#13;
of the entry characteristics of their students. In turn, many graduates are deficient in their subject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff ppraisal Report                              5&#13;
content competency. In order to improve the quality of the graduates, it is necessary that the&#13;
new students' performance be assessed and that guidance and training on learning strategies&#13;
and study habits be provided.&#13;
1.16      Career information systems need to be developed. Up to the mid-1980s, nearly all&#13;
of those who qualified in a secondary school teaching subject had a clear career path. Since&#13;
then, the absorptive capacity of secondary schools has declined. It is difficult to attract teach-&#13;
ers to the rural and remote areas. Teacher shortages still persist in some specia!ized subjects&#13;
(e.g., art and music) in provinces where the local LPTK does not run an appropriate training&#13;
program, and new recruits come from elsewhere. But in most of the subject areas, teaching&#13;
positions are filled (many graduates are said to be either unemployed or have nonteaching&#13;
employment). The Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) delegates the recruitment of&#13;
teachers for the provinces to the respective Kanwils (provincial education authorities). The&#13;
appointments of public school teachers, who are national civil service employees, are proc-&#13;
essed centrally in Jakarta. Since they are not regularly linked to the Kanwil office, most&#13;
LPTKs do not have timely information on employment, cannot provide employment counsel-&#13;
ing to their students, and do not follow up on the placement of their graduates.&#13;
1.17      Weak educational research. LPTK lecturers undertake research mainly to up-&#13;
grade their qualifications or to gain credit points for promotion. In many institutions, little of&#13;
this research relates to secondary schools. This is also because teachers themselves are sel-&#13;
dom exposed to classroom research and have rarely thought about themselves as researchers.&#13;
1.18      Research to improve instruction is needed. In addition to a well-functioning as-&#13;
sessment system for diagnosing the characteristics of the entering SI students, LPTKs should&#13;
promote studies related to improving classroom teaching. Current LPTK research provides&#13;
little feedback for use by lecturers in improving teacher effectiveness or by practicing teach-&#13;
ers in improving their instruction. LPTKs are often criticized that courses fail to exemplify&#13;
good pedagogy and remain unchanged from year to year.&#13;
1.19      Sharing of experiences and scholarly exchanges is limited. Many LPTKs publish&#13;
a journal with articles from their own teaching staff, but these do not receive wide circulation&#13;
outside the institution. Establishing a national journal on teacher education, particularly with&#13;
a focus on teaching techniques and research on schools, would reach a wider audience and&#13;
would serve as a forum for issues in Indonesian teacher education.&#13;
1.20      Inadequate accreditation systems. Currently there is no external validation of the&#13;
exit quality of graduates of the public LPTKs or of the programs offered. Courses of study and&#13;
their corresponding tests are designed, and administered, by the lecturers themselves. Although&#13;
there are comprehensive exams and thesis exams for those students who write theses, these do not&#13;
cover all students. The diplomas awarded as a result of the aggregate of courses are recognized and&#13;
accepted as the qualification for entry into the ranks of civil service employment. Under the Sec-&#13;
ond Teacher Training Project (Loan 2101 -IND), a system of self-evaluation and peer valida-&#13;
tion was developed and piloted. Separately, under the ongoing Second Higher Education&#13;
Development Project (Loan 331 I-IND) a self-evaluation model is being developed which is&#13;
concerned with input, process, and product. The results of these two self-evaluation models&#13;
can be considered as the bases of self-improvement and future direction-setting by the insti-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6            Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
tutions concerned. Both of these systems provide a model which could become part of the&#13;
new program under the BAN.&#13;
C. GOVERNMENT POLICIES ON TEACHER EDUCATION&#13;
1.21     The Government has made several important changes in teacher education poli-&#13;
cies in recent years. In 1989 a policy was established requiring all new primary school teach-&#13;
ers to be trained at the D-11 level (two-year postsecondary school) instead of the upper&#13;
secondary level as before. The Bank is currently assisting the implementation of this policy&#13;
through the Primary Teacher Development Project (Loan 3496-IND). The policy requires all&#13;
practicing primary school teachers (except those near retirement) to be upgraded to the D-11&#13;
level through distance or face-to-face education. In addition DGHE has phased out all di-&#13;
ploma courses for the preservice education of secondary school teachers (lower and upper),&#13;
so all new teachers at that level now need to have a SI degree. Practicing lower secondary&#13;
school teachers are now being officially upgraded to D-III level at the Government's expense.&#13;
So far there has been no regulation requiring current secondary school teachers to upgrade to&#13;
the SI level, although many have begun to upgrade using their own funds&#13;
2. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. PREVIOUS BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1      Over the last 25 years, the Bank Group has been involved in financing 33 educa-&#13;
tion and training projects in Indonesia (US$2,072.5 million), among which 21 projects&#13;
(US$1,406.0 million) have been implemented through the MOEC, including four projects&#13;
with substantial teacher training content (Annex 7). Bank lending has assisted the Govern-&#13;
ment from the start-up stages of alleviating shortage of technical personnel, to an increased&#13;
emphasis on quality issues, and then to a wider sectoral emphasis on investment programs&#13;
and policy reforms in education.&#13;
2.2      The Fourth Education Project (Loan 1237-IND), 1976-84, assisted the technical&#13;
faculties of IKIPs Padang and Yogyakarta providing buildings, furniture, and equipment for&#13;
2,750 students and domestic and overseas degree and nondegree fellowships to 186 teaching&#13;
staff, to improve their pedagogical skills and the mastery of subject matter content. The First&#13;
Teacher Training Project (Loan 1433-IND), 1977-84, provided classrooms, educational&#13;
equipment and instruments, books, and learning centers; implemented the 1976 primary&#13;
teacher education (SPG) curriculum and developed courses for the upgrading of SPG teachers&#13;
and administrative staff; the 1979 LPTK curriculum was produced; various subject matter&#13;
programs (including Bahasa Indonesia, English, mathematics) were improved; and courses&#13;
for upgrading IKIP academic and administrative staff were conducted. In the Second Teacher&#13;
Training Project (Loan 2101-IND), 1982-90, equipment was supplied to various teacher&#13;
training programs in Jakarta,  Yogyakarta, and Malang; the accompanying fellowship&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                            7&#13;
program trained six doctors, 124 masters, and 150 others who attended short courses; build-&#13;
ings, books, and educational equipment were provided to nine IKIPs and two FKIPs; 54&#13;
doctors, 111 masters were trained; and various programs for IKIPs were developed, including&#13;
a sandwich program for three graduate faculties, refresher programs, and short-term upgrad-&#13;
ing courses for lecturers and administrators. The Primary School Teacher Development Proj-&#13;
ect (Loan 3496-IND), ongoing since 1992, would produce well-trained primary school&#13;
teachers through the development of a tertiary-level diploma course. Placing graduates is&#13;
proving difficult because of the current zero-growth policy in hiring civil servants and the&#13;
continued hiring of unqualified teachers.&#13;
B. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.3       The following lessons have been learned from preceding Bank-assisted teacher&#13;
training projects in Indonesia. The project performance audit report (PPAR) "Indonesia&#13;
Fourth Education Project" (Report No. 6312, 1986) and the implementation completion report&#13;
(ICR) noted the difficulty in managing multiple project implementation units (PlUs) and the&#13;
need to keep funding operation and maintenance after the end of the project. The PPAR&#13;
"Indonesia Fifth Education (First Teacher Training) Project" (Report No. 6315, 1986) noted&#13;
the lack of training in the use of equipment procured by the project, minimizing the potential&#13;
benefit of that investment. And the ICR "Indonesia Second Teacher Training Project" (Report&#13;
No. 10217, 1991) noted the lack of coordination among units of the MOEC charged with&#13;
implementing the project; inadequate staffing for project management; the lack of English-&#13;
language competency of the teaching staff, minimal usefulness of project-procured library&#13;
books and references; and the lack of systematic mechanism for the selection, monitoring,&#13;
reentry, and utilization of project fellowship awardees.&#13;
2.4       Other recent Bank-supported teacher training projects point to the following les-&#13;
sons: (i) the need for intensive Bank supervision in the early stages of implementation and a&#13;
suitable balance of skills on supervision missions; and (ii) the importance of expert advice to&#13;
the counterparts so that the local staff can gain from training opportunities&#13;
2.5       The above lessons have been taken into account in the design of the proposed&#13;
project. The PIU for this project will be under the administrative supervision of the Govern-&#13;
ment's project unit for teacher education (PIMPRO), analogous to and supported by the PIU&#13;
for the ongoing Primary School Teacher Development Project (Loan 3496-IND), and would&#13;
have four senior education professionals assisting the Project Manager (para. 3.26). Coordi-&#13;
nation among project implementation subunits would be assured by the Project Development&#13;
Team of the office of the Project Manager, which would include representatives of the Direc-&#13;
torate-General of Primary and Secondary Education (DGPSE) and the Open University&#13;
(UT). Predeparture training, especially in the English language (para. 3.14), and training in&#13;
the use of equipment (para. 3.4) are integral parts of their respective components. Further, the&#13;
project would support the translation to Bahasa Indonesia of selected education books in in-&#13;
ternational languages (para. 3.5), to widen readership in the teacher education institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. BANK STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
Bank Strategy&#13;
2.6      The proposed project supports the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indo-&#13;
nesia which was presented to the Board on March 21, 1995. In terms of education and train-&#13;
ing, the Bank's strategy calls for continuing to assist Indonesia in meeting its development&#13;
objectives through a lending program that would address critical issues in human resource&#13;
development, especially those related to educational quality. This means increasing expendi-&#13;
tures on education and better distribution of teachers, staff training, and learning materials. At&#13;
the same time, the strategy calls for adaptation of approaches as appropriate to the transition&#13;
underway in Indonesia. In education and training, this means focusing the assistance to re-&#13;
gional and provincial levels and engaging the participation of beneficiaries at those decentral-&#13;
ized locations.&#13;
2.7      The proposed project actively pursues both elements of the strategy. On the one&#13;
hand, it directly addresses the educational issues of the quality of teacher formation and the&#13;
efficiency of teacher deployment. On the other hand, by taking the individual teacher training&#13;
institution as the unit of development, the project diverts attention from the DGHE in Jakarta&#13;
to focus more sharply on the LPTKs which are dispersed at 31 locations in the wide archipel-&#13;
ago. As was attempted during project preparation, project implementation would be through&#13;
preparation efforts and proposals by the individual institutions (with the help of technicians&#13;
and managers from the center, as needed), most of which are in the provinces.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.8      The Bank's unique comparative advantage is its having assisted in the formula-&#13;
tion, implementation, and evaluation of education projects throughout the developing world&#13;
and in Indonesia for over two decades. The Bank is a trusted partner in education develop-&#13;
ment in Indonesia and is being called upon at this stage of the country's development to in-&#13;
tensify assistance in strategic initiatives in all levels of education. Lessons from ongoing&#13;
projects in basic education are being considered in preparing a series of secondary education&#13;
projects focused on expansion and quality improvements at provincial levels. The ongoing&#13;
project in primary school teacher education provides invaluable experience on coordinating&#13;
many governmental agencies to make teacher training responsive to the needs of teachers in&#13;
schools. And an ongoing project in university research provides the impetus for the prepara-&#13;
tion of a new project aimed at improving undergraduate education along the lines of the "new&#13;
paradigm" of higher education (para. 1.5).&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The primary objective of the proposed project is to enhance teaching-learning proc-&#13;
esses in secondary schools through the improvement of teacher education in 31 public&#13;
LPTKs. The project would support activities in these institutions that promote quality and&#13;
efficiency in the preservice and inservice programs (including curricular, resource and staff&#13;
development); build educational research capacity; and enhance effective management. Fur-&#13;
ther, the project would support activities to establish sustainable linkages between LPTKs and&#13;
secondary schools and to define a wider mandate, toward conversion to university status for&#13;
selected LPTKs.&#13;
B. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
3.2      To achieve the above objectives, the project would have the following compo-&#13;
nents: (i) improving preservice and inservice teacher education; (ii) strengthening linkages to&#13;
secondary schools; (iii) raising the qualifications of teacher educators; (iv) building educa-&#13;
tional research capacity; and (v) preparing for a wider mandate. In addition, the project would&#13;
actively promote the participation of female educators and strengthen the project implementa-&#13;
tion capacity of DGHE.&#13;
Component 1: Improving Preservice and Inservice Teacher Education&#13;
(Base cost: US$30.6 million)&#13;
3.3      Curriculum improvement The SI curriculum would be further developed for&#13;
verticalflexibility (to allow students to shift between teaching in junior secondary and teach-&#13;
ing in senior secondary), horizontalflexibility (to enable graduates to teach more than one&#13;
subjects), and externalflexibility (to enable graduates to compete for employment outside the&#13;
education sector). Under this project, a team for English and another for the social sciences&#13;
(history, geography, economics, moral education) would be organized to further develop&#13;
flexibility in their respective subject areas. Comparable to the Bandung-based Basic Science&#13;
Team (BST), which was organized to improve the science and mathematics curricula, each&#13;
team would include a representative from the LPTK, the university, and the secondary school.&#13;
Representatives from the curriculum department of the MOEC's research and development&#13;
agency (Balitbang Dikbud) would also be involved as resource persons. A third team, for&#13;
subject-specific pedagogy, would be organized to recommend curriculum changes in peda-&#13;
gogy courses (general as well as subject-specific) for horizontal and vertical flexibility. This&#13;
team would have four members, to represent the pedagogy of language, mathematics, sci-&#13;
ences, and social sciences. The teams would be based at IKIPs known for their strong English&#13;
language, social science, and pedagogy programs, respectively. Based on the success of the&#13;
above teams, a fourth team, for Bahasa Indonesia, could be organized at project midtern,&#13;
following assessment of feasibility. The curriculum teams would call national meetings to&#13;
initiate the process; conduct the analysis and planning of curriculum development; visit SMPs&#13;
and SMAs to assess content and pedagogical competency needed to teach at those levels and&#13;
share the assessment with LPTKs; and organize for processing feedback, curriculum revision,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10          Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
and implementation at LPTKs. At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that not&#13;
later than July 1, 1996, the curriculum teams for English, social sciences, and subject-specific&#13;
pedagogy would be established; each such team would be established in an IKIP selected on&#13;
the basis of its strong English, social sciences or subject-specific pedagogy program, respec-&#13;
tively; and thereafter such teams would be maintained until the completion of the project&#13;
[para. 6.1 (a)].&#13;
3.4       Science equipment The BST (para.3.3), which would coordinate the implemen-&#13;
tation of this subcomponent, maintains a standard list of equipment which meets the curricu-&#13;
lar requirements in LPTK biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Based on this list,&#13;
the 10 IKIPs and two STKIPs have checked their current laboratory stock and identified the&#13;
items needed, to bring their respective institutions up to standard. The BST would review&#13;
each request, assess the condition of storage facilities, and verify the availability of recurrent&#13;
budgets for the provision of maintenance and consumables. It would develop a final list with&#13;
the requesting institution to be recommended for procurement under the project. The BST&#13;
would also conduct for LPTK staff workshops in the use and maintenance of the equipment.&#13;
These workshops would help teacher education candidates develop maintenance skills that&#13;
help make their teaching efficient.&#13;
3.5       Secondary textbooks and education references. Two complete sets of current&#13;
SMP and SMA textbook series published by Balai Pustaka of the Government and by major pub-&#13;
lishers in the private sector would be provided to all 31 public LPTKs to provide both faculty and&#13;
students access to the textbooks and other curriculum materials that are currently being used in&#13;
schools. In addition, a set of about 100 titles consisting of the latest international references in&#13;
education and other books on subject content and teaching methods would be provided to the li-&#13;
braries of each of the LPTKs. The writing of about 25 titles and the translation of about 75 foreign&#13;
publications would also be supported. These titles would help lecturers to promote active learning&#13;
among their students through discussion, problem-solving, self-study, and homework. Proposals&#13;
for writing or translation would be solicited by the PIU which would organize a team to select the&#13;
awardees.&#13;
3.6       Student support services. A student support center would be established in each&#13;
LPTK to provide tutorial services and assistance on study skills development, to help entering&#13;
students gain the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in their beginning-level&#13;
subject-matter courses. The LPTK would assign office space for the center which would have&#13;
a director and tutors, preferably faculty members during their off hours. The tutors would be&#13;
compensated accordingly, an incentive that would provide faculty members with an alterna-&#13;
tive to a second occupation and increase their time for interaction with students on campus.&#13;
3.7   Inservice education for secondary school teachers. To upgrade the qualification of&#13;
teachers, the majority of whom still have lower than S I qualifications, scholarships would be&#13;
awarded to applicants who show promise in contributing to school renewal, student teaching and&#13;
LPTK-school partnerships (Type 1); or are motivated but come from low-income families or re-&#13;
mote geographical areas (Type 2). Care would be taken to actively seek and include motivated&#13;
female teachers with leadership qualities for candidacy. Based on recent experience with D-III to&#13;
SI upgrading, the typical scholarship would cover about 20 academic credits over about two se-&#13;
mesters, full-time in residential courses (tatap muka) or about three semesters part-time or through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                          11&#13;
distance education offered at UT. A total of 18,000 scholarships would be awarded (14,000 to&#13;
SMP teachers, 4,000 to SMA teachers, or about 5 percent of teachers with D-III qualification),&#13;
with preference to Type I awards. The recipients would be chosen from nominations by individual&#13;
LPTKs through annual requests from the Kanwil; the number of recipients would be proportional&#13;
to the estimated number of teachers with D-111 qualification. Tutors for the distance education pro-&#13;
gram would be provided by LPTKs at the tutorial centers of UT. Short, on-campus face-to-face&#13;
and laboratory sessions would be arranged annually for about 600 distance education trainees who&#13;
live in remote locations.&#13;
3.8       Learning materials development. To support the upgrading programs, current&#13;
materials on subject-specific pedagogy developed for the face-to-face and distance education&#13;
programs of UT would be updated. The updating would consist of: (a) compiling feedback on the&#13;
effectiveness of the materials, revision of content consistent with improvements in the Sl&#13;
curriculum (para. 3.3), correcting errors; (b) editing for clarity of writing and presentation; (c)&#13;
trying out the revised materials in UT classrooms and revising the materials further on the basis of&#13;
users' comments and observations; (d) designing, typesetting, and illustrating the new edition; and&#13;
(e) printing the new edition. About 100 modules and accompanying guides for self-study, which&#13;
are used in regular classroom courses or for distance learning, would be updated under the project.&#13;
UT teams consisting of specialists in subject-specific pedagogy, SMP or SMA teachers, and&#13;
textbook or module development consultants would undertake the updating.&#13;
3.9       Offices and conference rooms. Modest study accommodation for lecturers and&#13;
small, departmental conference rooms would be provided to the IKIP or STKIP departments&#13;
exhibiting urgent need for space. The office area would average 6 sq. m. per staff. Individual&#13;
offices may be allocated to senior staff (guru besar, lektor kepala), shared offices to four or&#13;
more junior staff. The conference room area would average 12 sq. m. The review and revision&#13;
of space-use plans, including the partitioning of underutilized buildings, would be preferred&#13;
over new construction. The project would provide offices for up to 3,600 faculty members&#13;
(about 36 percent of the total teaching staff of the 12 target institutions), the estimated number&#13;
of faculty members who would need office space. Conference rooms would be provided&#13;
where space is available near the departmental office concerned.&#13;
Component 2: Strengthening Linkages to Secondary School&#13;
(Base cost: US$5.4 million)&#13;
3.10   Supporting school linkages. To strengthen teaching practicum and linkages to sec-&#13;
ondary schools, a five-member team composed of three representatives from LPTKs with&#13;
relatively good teaching pract: ims and two members from other LPTKs would be estab-&#13;
lished with assistance from th 'LU. The team, in consultation with Kanwils and secondary&#13;
school teachers, would draft suggestions for improving the content of the student teaching&#13;
experience and for providing incentives for schools, teachers, and LPTK staff. Such incen-&#13;
tives which include suggestions for improving student teaching experiences would be shared&#13;
in regional meetings with representatives of all LPTKs, Kanwils, and secondary school teach-&#13;
ers.&#13;
3.11   A small-grant system would be established to finance activities specifically focused&#13;
on improving student teaching and field experiences for teacher trainees, including selection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12          Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
and training of supervising teachers, early introduction of field experiences prior to student&#13;
teaching, and evaluation and grading of student teachers. To be eligible for the small grants,&#13;
proponents must show that the LPTK and schools jointly developed the proposal. One of the&#13;
grants would support the design of an assessment system for student teachers. The final prod-&#13;
uct would be a handbook for implementing the student teaching practicum, to be implemented&#13;
under normal and sustainable conditions, without project funding. At negotiations, the Gov-&#13;
ernment provided assurances that not later than July 1, 1996, the LPTK teaching practicum&#13;
team would be established and thereafter maintained until the completion of the project; not&#13;
later than July 31, 1997, the draft handbook for the implementation of the student teaching&#13;
practicum would be furnished to the Bank for comments; and, promptly thereafter, the hand-&#13;
book taking into account the comments of the Bank would be finalized [para. 6.1(b)].&#13;
3.12. To improve efficiency in the training system, DGHE would also take measures that&#13;
would optimize LPTK staff assignment and deployment and at the same time enhance LPTK&#13;
linkage to schools. The following would be considered: (a) teachers who entered LPTKs&#13;
without previous secondary teaching experience would be assigned to secondary schools&#13;
(manily SMP) or to the inservice training programs (D-III and SI upgrading) conducted by&#13;
the UT, as teachers and tutors, respectively (or for equivalent field service), for an appropriate&#13;
period of time; and (b) those teaches who have had the necessary experience would be as-&#13;
signed to SMPs or to the UT program, also for an appropriate period, to renew their secon-&#13;
dary school or equivalent experience. Other options for deployment to the field are the fol-&#13;
lowing: assignment as tutors in the open SMP (SMP terbuka), assignment as trainors in the&#13;
various inservice training programs, and recognizing the field service with academic equiva-&#13;
lence, an incentive for LPTK faculty. The measures could involve the provision of appropri-&#13;
ate training. The project would support DGHE efforts through the provision of local technical&#13;
assistance and coverage of regular administrative costs. At negotiations, the Government&#13;
provided assurances that not later than March 31, 1997, an action plan for the deployment of&#13;
about 2,400 excess LPTK faculty members to secondary schools and to UT would be pre-&#13;
pared and furnished to the Bank for comments; such plan would include: proposed incentives,&#13;
requirements that faculty members who have not had previous experience teaching at secon-&#13;
dary school level complete a specified period of time teaching at secondary schools, require-&#13;
ments that all faculty members have periodically required teaching experience at the secon-&#13;
dary school level, and proposal to increase the average student/teacher ratio of the LPTKs to&#13;
12 students per teacher; and that promptly thereafter all measures required to carry out the&#13;
action plan, taking into account the Bank's comments thereon, would be taken [para. 6.1(c)].&#13;
3.13     Partnerships with foreign institutions. As recommended by the project prepa-&#13;
ration study teams which visited teacher education institutions abroad, LPTKs would use&#13;
grant funds to form partnerships with foreign institutions which have well-developed, col-&#13;
laborative, field-based programs with schools. The partnership would include exchange of&#13;
staff and teachers consultancies as well as the interchange of ideas and interactions between&#13;
LPTKs and schools (Annex 8). The PIU would assist the LPTKs interested in establishing&#13;
formal agreements with foreign institutions. At negotiations, the Government provided assur-&#13;
ances that grants would be made in accordance with the procedures and on the conditions ac-&#13;
ceptable to the Bank [para. 6.1 (d)].&#13;

Component 3: Raising the Qualifications of Teacher Educators&#13;
(Base cost. US$32.4 million)&#13;
3.14      The Government has set the target of raising the qualification level of teaching&#13;
staff at tertiary level to 50 percent holding graduate degrees. To help teacher education&#13;
institutions achieve that target, the project would support around 1,600 fellowships at the&#13;
master's level and about 150 fellowships at the doctorate level. This would raise the number&#13;
of academic staff with graduate qualifications to about 6,800. Applications for fellowships&#13;
would be in the form of institutional proposals from all 31 participating LPTKs. The proposal&#13;
would include the list of candidates and detailed analysis of staff needs, showing, among&#13;
other things, staff-to-student and gender ratios and staff qualification levels (bachelor's,&#13;
master's, doctor's) for each teaching department; and justification for each fellowship, in&#13;
terms of the teaching and research needs of the appropriate department. For the doctorate&#13;
program, the research topic would be submitted with the proposal. The LPTKs would be&#13;
encouraged to include qualified women, particularly those with exemplary educational&#13;
leadership as candidates. During appraisal, the Government's criteria for the selection of&#13;
fellowship awardees were reviewed and found satisfactory to the Bank. At negotiations, the&#13;
Government provided assurances that fellowships would be provided in accordance with&#13;
selection criteria agreed with the Bank [para. 6.1 (e)].&#13;
3.15      Master's program. Of the 1,600 master's-level graduate fellowships, 1,450&#13;
would be undertaken at national institutions. The majority would focus on subject content.&#13;
Following the model established at Gadjah Mada University and Bandung Institute of&#13;
Technology for the science subjects, national universities were chosen as the target&#13;
institutions for master's programs in the nonscience subjects. The selection was based on an&#13;
assessment of the strength of the university department in particular subject areas. The&#13;
universities selected are: Indonesia (Ul), Pajajaran (UNPAD), Gajah Mada (UGM), Bogor&#13;
(IPB), Diponegoro (UNDIP), Airlangga (UNAIR), Brawijaya (UNIBRAW), Hasanuddin&#13;
(UNHAS), and Sumatera Utara (USU). The other 150 fellowships would be awarded, after&#13;
competition, to international institutions, for specialist study programs not available in&#13;
country or where capacity is limited. Participating LPTKs would be assisted in developing&#13;
procedures for selecting candidates and, if necessary, in providing remedial programs,&#13;
especially to improve the candidates' competency in English or other international languages.&#13;
3.16      Doctorate program. Many doctorate fellowships would involve the study of&#13;
subject-specific pedagogy (e.g., physics education and mathematics education) inasmuch as&#13;
most recruits would have already demonstrated their subject-content competence by complet-&#13;
ing an appropriate master's qualification. To bring advanced scholars into contact with the&#13;
international academic community, 100 of the 150 doctorate fellowships would be undertaken&#13;
overseas. Selection of overseas universities would be based primarily on the university's in-&#13;
ternational reputation in the respective field, but previous experience in running doctorate&#13;
programs for Indonesian students would also be considered. Some of the doctorate fellow-&#13;
ships would be on subject content rather than subject-specific pedagogy, for those institutions&#13;
preparing to offer noneducation degrees and transition to universities under a broader man-&#13;
date (para. 3.22). At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that all measures&#13;
would be taken to ensure that teaching staff, returning from overseas and local degree pro-&#13;
grams are offered teaching positions appropriate for the training received [para. 6. 1 (f)].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14          Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
3.17      Refresher courses and faculty workshops. Building on the success of the Sec-&#13;
ond Teacher Training Project (Loan 2101 -IND), this project would support a similar interna-&#13;
tional professional development program in the form of short-term fellowships for teacher&#13;
educators. Participants would be selected on the basis of a written proposal for a study topic.&#13;
The study topics would be expected to relate directly to the courses taught by the participant&#13;
in his or her LPTK. About 150 participants would be selected from among faculty members&#13;
who already hold the S2 degree but do not qualify for (or for personal reasons unable to ac-&#13;
cept) a doctoral fellowship. A limited number of international universities would be selected&#13;
as host institutions, likely the same ones as for the doctorate fellowship program (para. 3.16).&#13;
Proposals involving the production of materials suitable for use in subject-specific pedagogy&#13;
courses at the LPTK would be preferred over those of a general nature. On their return from&#13;
study, participants would produce their final manuscript which would be reproduced in lim-&#13;
ited numbers and distributed to all LPTKs. The authors would be encouraged to make ar-&#13;
rangements on their own for the commercial publishing of their work. In addition, to upgrade&#13;
the subject-specific pedagogical knowledge of subject education lecturers, eight regional&#13;
workshops for lecturers in content-specific pedagogy for each major teaching subject would&#13;
be organized. These staff development workshops would be conducted by instructors with&#13;
S2 qualifications in subject-specific pedagogy.&#13;
Component 4: Building Educational Research Capacity&#13;
(Base cost: US$2.9 million)&#13;
3.18      The proposed project has a variety of activities (paras. 3.19-21) to create a syner-&#13;
gistic environment for a stronger research culture and a capacity for research both in the&#13;
LPTKs and the secondary schools. Secondary school teachers and LPTK faculty would&#13;
jointly conduct school-based action research to improve classroom teaching and learning&#13;
while LPTK faculty would conduct educational research to improve curriculum and instruc-&#13;
tion. The project would support both international and national Masters and Doctorate degree&#13;
candidates to return with research skills and contribute to a critical mass of scholars who will&#13;
be able to build and develop the research culture. The project would encourage the develop-&#13;
ment of data collection instruments and scientific research skills as student assessment is con-&#13;
ducted and monitoring and evaluation of the project implementation is conducted in the&#13;
LPTKs. The project supports funding for the publication of research at all levels. Publications&#13;
in national and international refereed journals are encouraged in the project to encourage bet-&#13;
ter quality in educational research.&#13;
3.19      Entry-level student assessment. A procedure would be developed for assessing&#13;
entry-level mastery of the core subjects: natural sciences, mathematics, social sciences,&#13;
Bahasa Indonesia, and English. The procedure would include tests of subject matter mastery&#13;
as well as guidelines for scoring and using the results, all of which would be developed and&#13;
tested at different LPTKs. When ready for wider use, they would be introduced to the other&#13;
LPTKs. The tests would be used at the beginning of the relevant introductory courses, to&#13;
identify students needing special help (including peer tutoring) and for making decisions on&#13;
how best to teach their introductory courses (para. 3.6). A short list of possible tests or&#13;
guideline developers would be compiled and criteria for selection specified. The terms of&#13;
reference would be sent to LPTKs; those institutions submitting promising preliminary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                          15&#13;
proposals would be invited to a training and proposal writing workshop. In selecting the final&#13;
proposals, preference would be given to those which include outstanding SMA teachers as&#13;
members of their test construction teams. An IKIP-based research management team (with&#13;
the PIU research coordinator and a representative of Balitbang Dikbud as members) would&#13;
plan the activity, manage the teams of test developers, standardize the assessment procedure&#13;
guidelines, and ensure high product quality and outcomes. At negotiations, the Government&#13;
provided assurances that not later than October 1, 1996, the development of a test for new&#13;
undergraduate degree student assessment at LPTKs would commence; and not later than July&#13;
31, 1997, the testing of such students using such test would commence [para. 6.1(g)].&#13;
3.20      Quality assurance. The diagnostic tests to assess the entry-level subject&#13;
knowledge of new S 1 students would also be used as the tests to assess the exit-level&#13;
knowledge of all SI graduates, to ensure that the new teacher has mastered the content of the&#13;
subject he or she would teach in secondary school. In addition, an instrument to assess the&#13;
teaching skills of student teachers would be developed and used to assess the same sample of&#13;
student teachers during their student teaching experience. The development of an assessment&#13;
of teaching skills would be undertaken jointly by the LPTKs and a collaborating secondary&#13;
school and would be developed under the small grant program for strengthening the teaching&#13;
practicum and linkages to schools (para. 3.10). Together the two instruments would be used&#13;
to assess the quality of student output of LPTKs in the latter years of the project  At&#13;
negotiations it was agreed with the Government that not later than June 30, 1998, an action&#13;
plan for raising admission standards at selected IKIPs, based on the analysis of the testing of&#13;
new undergraduate degree students at LPTKs, would be furnished to the Bank for comments;&#13;
and thereafter, the action plan would be carried out, taking into account the comments of the&#13;
Bank on such [para. 6.1 (h)].&#13;
3.21      Research on the improvement of instruction. Grants would be provided in support&#13;
of proposals for studies related to the improvement of instruction in LPTKs. All proposals would&#13;
include a new course outline, instructional approaches, learning materials, or other kinds of&#13;
teaching resources that would be used to improve the quality of the researchers' own courses in&#13;
such ways as: (a) investigating common problems, errors, and misconceptions among SI&#13;
students; (b) studying ways of organizing and providing the laboratory component of a&#13;
science course; (c) developing and trying out innovative forms of student assessment;&#13;
(d) creating and trying out instructional materials; (e) experimenting with approaches to help&#13;
teachers become more research oriented; (f) developing and piloting new approaches to&#13;
foreign language instruction; and (g) trying out systems of student evaluation of LPTK&#13;
courses. About five study grants would be awarded each year. The typical study would be for 12-&#13;
18 months. Joint or collaborative studies would be encouraged. At the completion of each batch of&#13;
studies, regional seminars would be held where researchers can review each other's results and&#13;
products. A compilation of results would be published in special editions of educational journals.&#13;
This program would be managed by the IKIP-based research team. The grants would be made in&#13;
accordance with the procedures and on the conditions acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16          Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
Component 5: Preparing for a Wider Mandate&#13;
(Base cost: US$1. I million)&#13;
3.22      Planning for a wider mandate. The 10 IKIPs would be asked to consider conver-&#13;
sion to universities. Two or three IKIPs would be selected as institutions which would be assisted&#13;
in developing S I content programs in preparation for a future move to university status. These two&#13;
or three institutions would be expected to begin the process of developing full-fledged subject-&#13;
content departments and degrees, which would continue beyond the implementation period of this&#13;
project. During the project period, the selected institutions would design more flexible programs to&#13;
allow graduates to prepare for nonteaching jobs in selected areas. Selection of the two or three in-&#13;
stitutions would be based on institutional capacity in terms of staffing (numbers of staff with S2 or&#13;
S3 qualifications), facilities, and experience in program implementation. The proposals from insti-&#13;
tutions would be verified through visitation and dialogue with appropriate Higher Education Con-&#13;
sortium which would make final recommendations with the DGHE. This activity would be consis-&#13;
tent with projects envisioned by the Government within the "new paradigm" for higher education&#13;
(para. 1.5), including a quality improvement project in undergraduate education being prepared for&#13;
Bank financing. At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that not later than Oc-&#13;
tober 1, 1996, in accordance with selection criteria acceptable to the Bank, at least two IKIPs&#13;
for future conversion to university would be selected [para. 6.1 (i)].&#13;
3.23      Preparing for accreditation. The procedures and instrumentation for institu-&#13;
tional self-study and peer validation developed under the Second Teacher Training Project&#13;
(Loan 2101-IND) would be refined as models for continuous self-evaluation and improve-&#13;
ment for LPTKs. The procedures would also be consistent with the process of accreditation&#13;
being developed by the BAN. A task force, with members from both public and private&#13;
LPTKs, would coordinate the institutional self-study and peer validation activities which&#13;
would include promoting the program, refining the instruments and procedures for applica-&#13;
tion in public and private LPTKs, training in self-evaluation, and training evaluation report&#13;
writers and peer validators. It would also include holding periodic meetings with BAN. At&#13;
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that until completion of the project, a pol-&#13;
icy on zero growth in the appointment of faculty members to LPTKs would be maintained&#13;
except for fields of specialization in which there is a proven acute shortage of teachers; and&#13;
not later than October 1, 1996, the task force to coordinate the institutional self-study and&#13;
peer-evaluation activities would be established [para. 6.1 (j)].&#13;
3.24      Career planning. The proposed project would provide seed money to promote&#13;
the development of effective career information systems at the 10 IKIPs and two STKIPs.&#13;
The employment information gathered would be sensitive to the needs of women. Proposals&#13;
to the PIU from guidance-counseling faculty members in the LPTKs would include plans for&#13;
establishing links with major local private-sector firms. Preference would be given to pro-&#13;
posals which include plans for establishing a graduate follow-up system which includes in-&#13;
formation of particular interest to women. The systems to be developed would include both&#13;
teaching and nonteaching career opportunities. The information system would be made avail-&#13;
able to SI students early in their study programs to help them make informed choices about&#13;
the kinds of emphasis they would like to make in their studies.&#13;
&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                        17&#13;
C. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.25     The Director-General of Higher Education, assisted by the Director of Academic&#13;
Affairs, would have overall responsibility for the project. He would coordinate the activities&#13;
of the proposed project with those of the ongoing Primary School Teacher Development&#13;
Project (Loan 3496-IND) in respect to the involvement of LPTKs.&#13;
3.26     A Central Project Implementation Unit (CPIU) would be established in DGHE,&#13;
under the Government's project unit for teacher education development (PIMPRO) and paral-&#13;
lel to the PIU for the ongoing project (see Chart). The CPIU would be headed by a full-time&#13;
Project Manager who would be assisted by a Program Development Team, a Project Benefit&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation (PBME) unit (para.3.27), and management consultants. Senior&#13;
staff specialists, including qualified women specialists, would cover the key project areas of&#13;
curriculum development, staff development and inservice training, research and management&#13;
development, and procurement. Responsible for overall coordination of project activities and&#13;
liaison with the Bank, the Project Manager would: monitor and coordinate disbursement of&#13;
the loan; provide semiannual progress reports to the Director-General and to the Bank; pro-&#13;
vide advice to Local Project Implementation Units (LPIUs) and project coordinators; submit&#13;
withdrawal applications to the Bank; arrange for timely technical audits and audits of project&#13;
accounts; participate in the management of local and international staff development pro-&#13;
grams and of project-supported studies and evaluations; and prepare the periodic, midterm,&#13;
and completion reports. At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that the Central&#13;
and Local Project Implementation Units would be established with competent staff in ade-&#13;
quate numbers and maintained until the completion of the project [para 6.1 (k)].&#13;
3.27      The PBME unit would undertake the monitoring and formative evaluation of the&#13;
project in accordance with the agreed performance indicators (Annex 15) and the required&#13;
technical audits (para. 4.15). Additionally, the PBME would monitor closely the annual and&#13;
unit costs of the project, develop the methodology for measuring the magnitude of project&#13;
benefits, and during the project's midterm review, present an analysis of project costs and&#13;
benefits. The PBME would establish working relationships with the MOEC's national level&#13;
planning bureau and the research and development agency (Balitbang) or contract qualified&#13;
consultants to assist with monitoring and evaluation, especially in regard to the measurement&#13;
of project impact.&#13;
3.28     At each of the 12 IKIPs/STKIPs, LPIUs would be established. An LPIU project&#13;
officer would be appointed, provided with the necessary support staff, and given responsibil-&#13;
ity for managing project activities at his/her institution, according to rules and procedures&#13;
provided by the Project Manager. At each of the 19 FKIPs, the rector would designate a fac-&#13;
ulty dean as coordinator for the project. LPTK rectors and managers would be provided&#13;
training in institutional planning and organizational development, early during project imple-&#13;
mentation (project launch workshop) and at about midterm (preparation for REPELITA VII).&#13;
The LPIU project officer and the coordinator for the project in 19 FKIPs will also work with&#13;
the Coordination Forum (Annex 9).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18          Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
3.29     Technical assistance. In all project components, the technical assistance re-&#13;
quirements would be satisfied largely through the provision of national consultants (485.8&#13;
staff months). International consultants (18 staff months) would be recruited only in areas in&#13;
which local expertise is limited or lacking altogether. International expert assistance is de-&#13;
signed as institution building rather than "substitutive" services directly rendered as part of&#13;
implementation activities. (The technical assistance summary is in Annex 10)&#13;
3.30     Status of project preparation. A complete inventory of project preparation&#13;
documents including lists of science equipment and library books, the criteria for the selection&#13;
of fellowship awardees, and the TORs for project studies have been prepared by the Govern-&#13;
ment and thorough discussions have been conducted with the Bank. Implementation sched-&#13;
ules for each project component as well as a detailed implementation schedule for start-up&#13;
operation have been satisfactorily prepared (para. 3.3), along with TORs for consultants to be&#13;
engaged during first year. The Project Manager and the four senior staff would be appointed&#13;
immediately following negotiations. The criteria for selection of awardees to the small re-&#13;
search grants of the project as well as payment and accounting procedures have been estab-&#13;
lished. Evidence of Governmental budgetary provision for activities to be implemented dur-&#13;
ing fiscal year 1996-97 and the report verifying the extent of renovation of faculty offices and&#13;
conference rooms at each teacher education institution were provided at negotiations.&#13;
3.31     Implementation schedule. The proposed project would be implemented over a&#13;
period of five years, from April 1, 1996 to March 31, 2001. The detailed schedules of imple-&#13;
mentation of all project activities (Annex 11), costs by year and component (Annexes 12),&#13;
procurement (Annex 13), and disbursement (Annex 14) would serve as the basis for project&#13;
implementation and would be updated annually by the Project Manager of the CPIU in coop-&#13;
eration with the LPIU project officers and FKIP project coordinators. The closing date of the&#13;
project would be September 30, 2001.&#13;
3.32     Fund channeling. No new development budget item (DIP) would be created for&#13;
the project. Project funds for the CPIU office operation, for national workshops and interna-&#13;
tional fellowships, and for the procurement of books and journals and of limited quantities of&#13;
equipment, furniture and consumable materials, and first-year funds for domestic fellowships&#13;
and grants would be located in the DIP of the DGHE. Project funds for LPIU operating costs,&#13;
local training and workshops, local journals and library books, science equipment, furniture,&#13;
consumable materials, civil works, scholarships for the D-III upgrading program, and grants&#13;
from the second year onward would be located in the respective DIPs of the beneficiary&#13;
LPTK. Project funds for domestic fellowships for the S2 program from the second year on-&#13;
ward would be located in the DIP of the target university concerned.&#13;
D. PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
3.33     Performance indicators. The project's performance indicators (Annex 15) were&#13;
discussed and agreed with the Government during negotiations. The implementation progress&#13;
of the project would be assessed through monitoring activities and formative evaluation using&#13;
the detailed performance indicators. Additionally, outcome indicators have been identified to&#13;
guide development impact evaluation. The PBME (para. 3.27) would undertake the monitor-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                         19&#13;
ing and formative evaluation as well as the required technical audits (para. 4.15). The above&#13;
indicators would also form the basis of technical supervision by the Bank. (The supervision&#13;
plan is summarized in Annex 16.)&#13;
3.34      At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that policies and procedures&#13;
adequate to enable monitoring and evaluation on an ongoing basis of the project and the&#13;
achievement of the objectives thereof would be maintained in accordance with indicators sat-&#13;
isfactory to the Bank and under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; a report would be&#13;
prepared and furnished to the Bank on or about December 31, 1998 integrating the results of&#13;
the above monitoring and evaluation activities, the progress achieved in the carrying out of&#13;
the project during the period preceding the date of said report, and the measures recom-&#13;
mended to ensure the efficient carrying out of the project and the achievement of the objec-&#13;
tives thereof during the period following such date; that by April 1, 1999, or such later date as&#13;
the Bank shall request, the report would be reviewed with the Bank; and that all measures re-&#13;
quired to ensure the efficient completion of the project and the achievement of the objectives&#13;
thereof would be taken, based on the conclusions and recommendations of the said report and&#13;
the Bank views on the matter [para.6.1 (1)].&#13;
3.35      Progress reports. The Government agreed to prepare semiannual progress re-&#13;
ports and submit them to the Bank by March 31 and before October 1 of each year. Data from&#13;
the detailed performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation (Annex 15) would be in-&#13;
corporated in the progress report.&#13;
3.36      Annual and midterm reviews. The timing of the annual review would be coor-&#13;
dinated with the annual budget preparation cycle and would involve the rectors of the IKIPs&#13;
and STKIPs, deans of FKIPs, and officials of the DGHE. The midterm review and assess-&#13;
ment will be in 1999. At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that not later&#13;
than October 1 in each year, commencing October 1, 1997, and until the completion of the&#13;
project, a report on the implementation of the budget for the project for the past and current&#13;
fiscal year, together with the proposed budget for the following fiscal year would be fur-&#13;
nished to the Bank for comments; and thereafter, the proposed budget for the following fiscal&#13;
year would be revised, taking into account the Bank's comments [para. 6.1 (m)].&#13;
3.37      Impact on Poverty. Recent statistical information on age, income, place of resi-&#13;
dence, and school attendance show that in 1992, the largest number (from 75 to 90 percent)&#13;
of 13-year olds not enrolled in junior secondary schools belong in the lowest four income&#13;
deciles and live in rural areas. These populations are specially identified in the Government's&#13;
program of secondary education expansion through SMP kecils and SMP terbuka (para 1.2).&#13;
In turn, this project would improve the quality of teachers for the planned expansion. Project&#13;
interventions would therefore have a specially beneficial effect to students who are poor and&#13;
living in rural areas.&#13;
3.38      Impact on women. The proposed project actively seeks to increase the number of&#13;
qualified women in leadership positions in the education sector. Proficient female teachers&#13;
with good leadership skills would be given priority in the project's scholarship awards for&#13;
upgrading teachers to bachelor's degree level (para. 3.7). Project fellowships for LPTK&#13;
faculty to master's degree studies have been weighted in favor of Indonesian universities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20            Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
partly to enable women to compete for fellowships to in-country programs which are looked&#13;
upon as more socially acceptable for Indonesian women and their families. Project&#13;
fellowships for short-term refresher courses and those for doctorate studies would set aside&#13;
awards proportionate to the number of women in the teacher education faculties, to encourage&#13;
qualified women to play more strategic roles in teacher education and policy formulation&#13;
(para. 3.13). Priority in the award of research grants would also be given to female teacher&#13;
proponents, and school-based research on girls would be a required topic (paras. 3.16-17).&#13;
Women will be appointed to the project's management and monitoring units (para. 3.26).&#13;
3.39      Impact on the environment. The environmental impact of the proposed project&#13;
is expected to be neutral (environment category "C") as there would be only minor civil&#13;
works undertaken by the project. Where appropriate, environmental awareness would be in-&#13;
cluded in new curricula and instructional materials used in the teacher education programs.&#13;
4. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT, AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT CosTs&#13;
4.1       Summary of costs The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 87.1 million&#13;
equivalent (Rp. 195.6 billion), including contingencies and identifiable taxes and duties. Ta-&#13;
bles 4.1 and 4.2 summarize the estimated costs by project component and by category of ex-&#13;

4.2        Bases of cost estimates. Base costs are estimated using November 1995 prices.&#13;
Civil works costs are based on average square meter renovation costs for Government&#13;
buildings. Science and office equipment and furniture costs are based on current prices for&#13;
similar imported or locally available items. Learning and teaching materials costs are based&#13;
on similar items recently procured in other education projects in Indonesia. Costs for&#13;
international and domestic consultants are in line with recent education projects for&#13;
appropriately qualified experts. The unit cost for domestic fellowships is about US$4,000 per&#13;
staff-year for the master's degree programs and US$5,000 per staff-year for the doctorate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22           Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
programs. Overseas training and fellowships range from US$15,000 per staff-month for&#13;
short-term training to US$25,000 per staff-year for master's programs and US$30,000 per&#13;
staff-year for doctorate programs. Operational costs are consistent with current Government&#13;
figures and recent education projects. Costs for short-term, in-country training vary widely,&#13;
depending on the type of training and its location, and average between US$50-70 per&#13;
training day. Scholarship grants are about US$450 per staff-year. Research grants range from&#13;
US$45,000-100,000 per staff-year depending on the scope and the program. Costs for link&#13;
grants are set at US$3,300 per staff-year for those with domestic partnerships and&#13;
US$123,000 per staff-year for those with foreign institutions. Project operating costs have&#13;
been agreed between the Bank and the DGHE.&#13;
4.3       Contingency allowances. Physical contingencies (US$2.4 million) represent&#13;
3 percent and price contingencies (US$8.1 million) 11 percent of baseline costs. Physical&#13;
contingencies of 10 percent have been allowed. Price contingencies have been calculated at&#13;
6.0 percent per year for local costs and 2.6 percent per year for foreign costs. No price con-&#13;
tingencies have been allowed for link grants and research grants.&#13;
4.4       Foreign exchange costs. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$37.2 mil-&#13;
lion (representing about 43 percent of total project costs) based on the following percentages:&#13;
(i) overseas fellowships, 90 percent; (ii) equipment and international consultants, 80 percent;&#13;
(iii) link grants, 50 percent; (iv) civil works, furniture, research grants, and learning and&#13;
teaching materials, 30 percent; and (v) domestic consultants, domestic studies, scholarship&#13;
grants, consumable materials, local training, project operating costs, 10 percent.&#13;
4.5       Taxes and duties. Identifiable taxes and duties are estimated at US$1.7 million&#13;
(Rp. 3.9 billion) based on the current 10 percent value added tax on all goods and materials,&#13;
and it would be financed 100 percent by the Government of Indonesia.&#13;
B. FINANCING&#13;
4.6       Financing plan. The total project cost of US$87.1 million equivalent would be&#13;
financed by a proposed loan of US$60.4 million, covering about 70 percent of total project&#13;
costs. The Government would finance from its annual budget the remaining costs of US$26.7&#13;
million equivalent, approximately 30 percent of the total project cost including taxes.&#13;
4.7       Sustainability. The GOI's commitment to its nine-year basic education plan en-&#13;
sures necessary support to teacher training and for the project to sustain its impact. This has&#13;
been confirmed by the decision of MENPAN to allocate 25,000 new positions to MOEC for&#13;
hiring in academic year 1996-97 while in other government agencies the zero-growth policy&#13;
in hiring civil servants is strictly enforced. As secondary education expands in the future, the&#13;
sector's capacity to absorb new graduates from LPTKs will be continuously strengthened.&#13;
4.8       Successful implementation of the project would not only strengthen the quality of&#13;
the teacher education programs, but would also increase the cost-effectiveness and improve&#13;
the institutional capacity of the LPTKs. Under the project, quality assurance and accreditation&#13;
mechanisms would ensure that the LPTKs would continuously conduct self-examination and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                          23&#13;
strive for quality enhancement. The project would improve cost-effectiveness of the LPTKs&#13;
and make teacher education's link to secondary schools a permanent feature of the LPTKs&#13;
through practice teaching and school-based action research. Both features would further en-&#13;
hance the sustainability of the project impact.&#13;

4.9       To sustain the efforts under the project, additional recurrent funds will be required&#13;
to maintain science equipment and new facilities, continue linkages to secondary schools and&#13;
pay salary increases to teaching staff trained under the project. The amount required is esti-&#13;
mated to be about US$2.3 million, 3.5 percent of the recurrent expenditure of the&#13;
IKIPs/STKIPs, and even lower if the FKIPs are taken into account. Indeed this amount would&#13;
be more than offset by the amount of cost savings realized by raising student-teacher ratio to&#13;
12:1 (paras. 1.6 and 3.12), US$4.7 million per year by redeploying excess teaching staff and&#13;
one-time US$7.9 million by scaling down construction of office accommodations as a result&#13;
of reduced teaching staff (Annex 17). Therefore, the project is unlikely to cause a financial&#13;
burden to the Government.&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.10      The loan proceeds would be used to finance procurement of goods and services&#13;
under all project components. Unless otherwise noted, the procurement would be in accor-&#13;
dance with the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January&#13;
1995), for the following:&#13;
(a)   Civil works (about US$4.0 million equivalent). There would be no major new&#13;
construction; most of the contracts would be for minor renovation or extensions.&#13;
Because of the geographical dispersion of project sites, contracts for civil works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24          Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
would be awarded on the basis of national competitive bidding (NCB) proce-&#13;
dures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for civil works valued at less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.2 million, may be&#13;
procured through a procedure similar to national shopping. Under this procedure,&#13;
the small works would be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic con-&#13;
tractors in response to a written invitation.&#13;
(b)   Equipment, furniture, consumable materials (US$15.0 million). The pro-&#13;
curement of science equipment and a small amount of consumable materials&#13;
would be handled by local education institutions where the goods are being de-&#13;
livered, after approval from the Basic Science Team, which serves as a technical&#13;
advisory board for science equipment. A small amount of office equipment and&#13;
consumable materials would be procured by the CPIU. All goods contract pack-&#13;
ages valued at or above US$200,000 would be awarded under international com-&#13;
petitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Local manufacturers would be granted a 15&#13;
percent domestic margin of preference. Contract packages valued less than&#13;
US$200,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$7.6 million, would be awarded&#13;
through NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contract packages valued at&#13;
less than US$50,000 and equipment of specialized nature for which NCB is not&#13;
practical, up to an aggregate limit of US$4.6 million including taxes, may be&#13;
purchased through prudent national shopping on the basis of three price quota-&#13;
tions.&#13;
(c)   Learning and teaching materials (US$2.0 million). This includes library books&#13;
and periodicals, research and study papers, manuals, guides produced and&#13;
printed locally, and small quantities of foreign journals and books. Printing&#13;
services would be procured through NCB while already printed books and&#13;
teaching materials would be procured through national shopping procedures or,&#13;
with the Bank's prior agreement, after negotiations, directly from publishers and&#13;
local distributors or book jobbers up to an aggregate amount of US$0.8 million.&#13;
(d)   Consultant services and studies (US$1.6 million). Consultants would be se-&#13;
lected and contracted in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consult-&#13;
ants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency&#13;
(August 1981).&#13;
(e)  International and domestic fellowships (US$34.7 million). Placement of can-&#13;
didates in foreign and domestic institutions would be made on the basis of the&#13;
relevance and quality of the programs offered, costs, and prior experience, ac-&#13;
cording to Government administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(f)   Grants (US$5.9 million). Grants would be awarded on a competitive procedure&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Awards would be based on criteria for relevance of the&#13;
topic and qualifications of the parties selected, according to operating guidelines&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. Small equipment items and consumables are allowed&#13;
through prudent shopping under the grants (paras. 3.11 and 3.13) operating&#13;
guidelines acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                         25&#13;
(g)   Scholarships (US$10.0 million). Tuition scholarships to local universities or&#13;
other training institutions would be awarded to selected secondary school teach-&#13;
ers who have lower than SI qualifications by direct contracting in accordance&#13;
with the agreed criteria.&#13;
(h)   Local training (US$9.4 million). Contracts for training would be awarded to lo-&#13;
cal providers in accordance with the Government's administrative requirements&#13;
and procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(i)   Project operating costs (US$4.5 million). Project operating expenses for the&#13;
central and local implementation units, including honoraria, travel allowances,&#13;
office consumables, and other operational costs, e.g., meetings and administra-&#13;
tive support would be met, following Government administrative procedures ac-&#13;
ceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.11      Review by the Bank would be as follows:&#13;
(a)   All ICB procurement would be based on the Bank's Standard Bidding Docu-&#13;
ments. The Bank would carry out prior review of : (i) standard bidding docu-&#13;
ments for civil works and goods contracts to be awarded under NCB procedures;&#13;
and (ii) letters of invitation for consultant services, to ascertain their conformity&#13;
with Bank guidelines. The approved documents would be used as master docu-&#13;
ments for all future bidding.&#13;
(b)   All civil works contracts valued at or over US$500,000, if any, and goods con-&#13;
tracts valued at or over US$200,000 would be subject to prior review by the&#13;
Bank, whereas all other contracts for civil works and goods would be subject to&#13;
random postreview. However, the first contract for civil works estimated to cost&#13;
the equivalent of US$100,000 or more and the first contract for goods estimated&#13;
to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or more, would be subject to prior review.&#13;
Roughly 20 percent of civil works contracts, and 25 percent of goods contracts&#13;
are likely to be covered by prior review. The IKIPs which would be handling the&#13;
civil works contracting have previous experience with two Bank-financed proj-&#13;
ects; the DGHE office, where the CPIU would be located, has been implement-&#13;
ing several Bank-financed projects. Based on such experiences with civil works&#13;
contracting and the mandatory screening of The Basic Science Team for science&#13;
equipment procurement, these prior review percentages are sufficient. In addi-&#13;
tion, standard bidding documents would be used for both ICB and NCB proce-&#13;
dures, and regular random post review would be carried out by the World Bank&#13;
Resident Mission and supervision missions.&#13;
(c)   Consultant contracts valued at or over US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals would be subject to prior review by the Bank. All other consultant&#13;
contracts would be subject to random post review. However, all consultants'&#13;
terms of references and sole-source selection of consulting firms would be sub-&#13;
ject to prior review.&#13;
(d)   Fellowships would be subject to random post-review by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26            Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
(e)   Annual training plans for each year would be included in the annual report for&#13;
discussion with the Bank.&#13;

D. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.12     The proposed loan of US$60.4 million equivalent would be disbursed over a pe-&#13;
riod of about five years (Annex 14). The project is expected to be completed by March 31,&#13;
2001, and the Loan would be closed six months later on September 30, 2001. The disburse-&#13;
ment schedule is based on the implementation schedule and the disbursement profile for edu-&#13;
cation projects in Indonesia. Disbursement is accelerated somewhat to reflect the establish-&#13;
ment of the Special Account and the timely implementation history of DGHE. Disbursements&#13;
estimated for the first semester of FY96 are based on the proposed initial deposit into the&#13;
project Special Account. Disbursements would be made as follows:&#13;
Civil works                    US$ 1,800,000      50% of total expenditures&#13;
Equipment (except under grants),  US$ 10,800,000  100% of foreign&#13;
furniture, and learning, teaching,                expenditures&#13;
and consumable materials                          100% of local expenditures&#13;
(ex-factory cost)&#13;
65% of local expenditures&#13;
for other items procured&#13;
locally&#13;
Consultant services and        US$  900,000       70% of total expenditures&#13;
studies&#13;
International fellowships      US$17,800,000      100% of total expenditures&#13;
Domestic fellowships           US$ 6,700,000      50% of total expenditures&#13;
Scholarships                   US$ 6,300,000      70% of total expenditures&#13;
Grants                         US$ 3,800,000      70% of grant amount&#13;
Local training                 US$ 4,300,000      50% of total expenditures&#13;
Project operating costs        US$ 2,000,000      50% of total expenditures&#13;
Unallocated                    US$ 6,000,000&#13;
4.13     Disbursements from the loan for the following contracts would be made against&#13;
full documentation: (i) civil works contracts valued at or more than US$500,000 and the first&#13;
contract valued at or more than US$100,000; (ii) goods contracts valued at or more than&#13;
US$200,000 and the first contract valued at or more than US$50,000; and (iii) consultant&#13;
services contracts with individual consultants valued at or more than US$50,000 and consult-&#13;
ing firm contracts valued at or more than US$100,000. All other disbursements would be&#13;
made against statements of expenditure (SOE) for which relevant documents would be re-&#13;
tained by DGHE and made available for review as requested by visiting Bank missions. To&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28          Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
facilitate disbursements, a Special Account in an amount of US$4.0 million would be estab-&#13;
lished at Bank Indonesia. This Special Account would be held in the name of the Directorate-&#13;
General of Budget, Ministry of Finance, following established procedures. The Special Ac-&#13;
count would be used for all eligible foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment to the&#13;
Special Account would be made on a monthly basis or when 20 percent of the initial deposit&#13;
has been used, whichever occurs first.&#13;
E. ACCOUNTS, AUDITS AND REPORTS&#13;
4.14     The PIU would prepare the financial report. The financial statements and financial&#13;
report for each fiscal year would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
including a separate audit opinion on SOE expenditures. Certified copies of the financial re-&#13;
port on the project for each Government fiscal year, together with the auditors' statements,&#13;
would be furnished to the Bank as soon as available, but not later than six months after the&#13;
end of each Government fiscal year starting March 31, 1997. DGHE would also monitor pro-&#13;
gress in project implementation each semester and submit reports to the Bank by March 31&#13;
and September 30 of each year. Within six months after the completion of disbursement,&#13;
DGHE would submit an implementation completion report (ICR) to the Bank.&#13;
4.15     DGHE has the primary responsibility to monitor all project activities and routine&#13;
monitoring would be done through annual reviews. The PBME unit (para 3.26) would con-&#13;
duct the technical audit of key project activities. The above audits would cover activities in&#13;
progress and post review of completed actions to examine whether implementation of the&#13;
various project components are technically appropriate and to recommend corrective meas-&#13;
ures, if necessary. Documents, studies, and data sets as well as an inventory of the Govern-&#13;
ment's project preparation documents are listed in Annex 18. At negotiations, the Govern-&#13;
ment provided assurances that technical audits of project implementation would be carried&#13;
out, in a manner acceptable to the Bank, in each fiscal year during implementation of the&#13;
project and a copy of such audit would be furnished to the Bank for comments as soon as&#13;
available but not later than six months after the end of each such year [para. 6.1 (n)).&#13;
5. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1    Research from developing countries shows a positive correlation between high quality&#13;
teachers and high student achievement. The correlation between teacher quality and student&#13;
achievement is even higher for under-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds.&#13;
As Indonesia increases its intake of secondary school students through the new nine-year uni-&#13;
versal basic education policy, a socially and economically diverse body of students will enter&#13;
secondary schools. Higher quality teachers would be in place through this project to meet the&#13;
educational challenges they pose. Studies from Latin America show substantial rates of return&#13;
to investments in raising the quality of teachers because of subsequent higher earnings of&#13;
their students. Evidence of the benefits of teacher development are clearly confirmed in inter-&#13;
national and Indonesian educational research as presented above. Systems of monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                          29&#13;
evaluation would ensure that the project interventions translate into increased competence to&#13;
teach for LPTK graduates and improved learning for secondary school students. Country data&#13;
are currently insufficient for a sensitive cost-benefit analysis. However, the project will col-&#13;
lect data to assess benefits (including project impact and cost-effectiveness) through the Proj-&#13;
ect Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (PBME).&#13;
5.2    This project specifically benefits an estimated new 25,000 secondary school teachers&#13;
per year, and approximately two million secondary school students. Project interventions will&#13;
benefit the professional capacity of teacher educators, leading to improvements in educational&#13;
quality as well as student achievement. The LPTK institutions would benefit through im-&#13;
provements in curriculum, linkages with schools, staff development, facilities, and research&#13;
capacity. Project interventions will benefit the professional capacity of teacher educators,&#13;
leading to improvements in educational quality as well as student achievement. The following&#13;
activities will contribute directly to these outcomes: in-country and overseas fellowships, im-&#13;
proved preservice and inservice programs, linking teacher training institutions to secondary&#13;
schools, and building research capacity. The project will also benefit the student staff ratio in&#13;
the public teacher education institutions, contributing to internal efficiencies in per-pupil&#13;
spending.&#13;
5.3    The project would improve cost-effectiveness of LPTKs by raising the student-&#13;
teacher ratio of the LPTKs to 12:1 (paras. 1.6 and 3.12), saving US$ 4.7 million annually by&#13;
reassigning, on a rotational basis, about 2,400 excess teaching staff to secondary schools and&#13;
UT every year and a one-time US$7.9 million by scaling down construction of office accom-&#13;
modations. This measure would also help LPTK teaching staff renew their secondary school&#13;
teaching experience . The project will meet the external demand for teachers created as a re-&#13;
sult of the expansion in junior secondary enrollment. Project interventions will enhance&#13;
training, to enable graduates to find employment in secondary schools or elsewhere, through&#13;
tutoring during formal coursework, mentoring during practice teaching, and making informa-&#13;
tion on teacher supply and demand available to their own institution, schools, and the provin-&#13;
cial teacher recruitment authorities.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
5.4    The proposed project is subject to several risks. First are risks related to the complex&#13;
institutional environment in which the project would be mounted. Effective coordination&#13;
among numerous Government institutions would be required for optimal project implementa-&#13;
tion, including supportive efforts by the Ministry of Finance and BAPPENAS (maintaining&#13;
expected Government expenditure levels), the DGPSE (providing access to secondary&#13;
schools as training sites and cooperating teacher-mentors), the State Ministry for Administra-&#13;
tive Reform (maintaining the expected recruitment levels for new teachers), and the DGHE&#13;
(strengthening management support for teacher education and instituting effective systems for&#13;
public-private institutional accreditation). The Coordination Forum (Annex 9) which includes&#13;
representation of the above agencies has been revitalized to enhance a close coordination. Fi-&#13;
nally, there is the risk that the attention to project targets would overshadow the more impor-&#13;
tant quality improvement objectives of the project. Comprehensive monitoring mechanism&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30           Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
would be instituted and the project would be reviewed frequently so that the qualitative fea-&#13;
tures are not only maintained but emphasized.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
This annex, following the East Asia and Pacific Region's checklist on economic&#13;
analysis of education projects, summarizes the arguments and evidence on the&#13;
effectiveness and sustainability of the proposed project under the following topics:&#13;
Indonesia's education priorities, analysis of project alternatives, the project's fiscal impact,&#13;
economic benefit, and institutional soundness. Paragraph numbers and annexes cited here&#13;
refer to those of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).&#13;
Are the Government's priorities in education appropriate?&#13;
To improve its competitiveness in international markets, principally in low-cost,&#13;
labor-intensive industries, Indonesia must be able to draw upon a well-educated and easily&#13;
trainable work force. Educational policy for the past two decades has therefore focused on&#13;
the provision of basic education at the primary level in order to upgrade the skills of the&#13;
general population and make them more employable. The result has been a remarkable,&#13;
near-universal enrollment in primary schools. In 1994, the Government started&#13;
implementing obligatory basic education from six to nine years in order to raise&#13;
educational levels needed for the training of a more highly skilled workforce demanded by&#13;
the high growth economy.&#13;
Indonesia's policies which emphasize basic education are well crafted, and the&#13;
country's objectives are in accord with international research evidence on the benefits of&#13;
basic education and its ability to contribute to economic development. Stronger grounding&#13;
in educational fundamentals also enables individuals to continue to develop their own&#13;
skills, productive capacities, attitudes and to pursue better career options in an evolving&#13;
labor market. Basic education also benefits society through indirect effects on health,&#13;
fertility, and life expectancy'. As a result of the decision to expand basic education, junior&#13;
secondary enrollment is expected to expand significantly, and more teachers will be&#13;
needed.&#13;

What are the International experiences in teacher development?&#13;
A World Bank review of 32 studies2 concluded that trained teachers make a significant&#13;
difference in student achievement in developing countries. Among the teacher-related&#13;
factors which positively correlated with student achievement are teacher qualifications,&#13;
teachers' classroom experience, years of education, and teachers' level of skill or&#13;
knowledge. One Indonesian research3 cited in the review found that upgrading teachers'&#13;
skills and knowledge leads to both significant and cost-effective improvements in student&#13;
outcomes. Research on public secondary school teachers in neighboring Thailand and&#13;
Malaysia also shows positive correlation between high quality teachers and high student&#13;
achievement. The correlation is even higher for underachieving students from&#13;
disadvantaged backgrounds4. In addition, studies from Latin America show substantial&#13;
returns to investments in raising the quality of teachers in terms of student's length of&#13;
schooling completed and subsequent higher earnings5.&#13;
Teacher education as a critical alternative. When governments stretch their&#13;
scarce educational resources to cover growing student enrollments, per-pupil spending&#13;
shrinks, impairing the quality of education. Over the last 30 years, enrollment has&#13;
expanded more rapidly than investments in education. Under these circumstances, a well-&#13;
trained teacher can be the most valuable and often most cost-effective investment in the&#13;
educational system that a government can make6. Compared to all other school inputs&#13;
such as classroom  space, textbooks, equipment, and teaching materials, teachers are&#13;
unique because of their ability to maximize the potential of other inputs and utilize them&#13;
actively to enhance students' learning'.&#13;
Complementarity of teacher education with other educational inputs. The&#13;
other principal inputs for expanding secondary education and improving quality (facilities,&#13;
textbooks, and materials) are being provided. Student places for the nine-year basic&#13;
education program would be provided through the series of province-based secondary&#13;

education projects currently being developed also with Bank assistance. Textbooks and&#13;
learning materials, the input consistently associated with improvements in student&#13;
achievement, are being provided through the Book and Reading Development Project&#13;
(Loan No. 3887-IND). This project, which would provide training for teachers, would&#13;
complete the provision system. Research shows that while certain individual inputs raise&#13;
achievement better than others, where resources are sufficient, optimal results are brought&#13;
about by the combined effects of educational inputs'.&#13;
What investment alternatives were considered, and what criteria were used to choose&#13;
some and reject others?&#13;
Interventions selected for the project were reviewed and assessed in terms of their&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness based on international and Indonesian evidence on teacher&#13;
quality as described below:&#13;
Investing in private teacher education institutions. Although there are 211 private&#13;
teacher education institutions in Indonesia that produce about 29,000 secondary school&#13;
teachers yearly, the training in those institutions is considered far inferior to the quality&#13;
levels achieved by the public sector institutions. To upgrade instructional capability to the&#13;
levels that would enable those institutions to prepare teachers for the expanded nine-year&#13;
basic education would require financial, technical, and development time investments&#13;
unacceptable to the Government which aims at reaching their expansion targets in 10-15&#13;
years. In contrast, the 31 public institutions (12 stand-alone teacher education institutes&#13;
and 19 education faculties or colleges affiliated with public universities) which produce&#13;
about 20,000 teachers yearly, have better facilities, teachers and resources as well as&#13;
higher standards of admission and self-assessment. They are therefore in a much better&#13;
position to undertake the curricular, management, and other institutional 'te-tooling" to&#13;
improve teacher training for the Government's planned expansion. In fact, selected public&#13;
institutions are already in the process of institutional improvement: reforms in science and&#13;
mathematics teaching are being initiated from Bandung (para. 3.3), and a new preservice&#13;
education program, mostly at public training institutions for primary school teachers, has&#13;
been developed by the Bank-financed Primary School Teacher Development Project (Loan&#13;
No. 3496-IND). Therefore, the alternative to fund private LPTKs was rejected for the&#13;
current project.&#13;
Attracting quality candidates to teaching. To keep up with the rapid expansion of&#13;
basic education, many developing countries, particularly in Asia, have 'hnass-produced"&#13;
teachers, frequently sacrificing quality of training to obtain the needed numbers of teachers&#13;
in abbreviated training time. The historic high regard in Asia for teaching has thus been&#13;
eroded, partly as a result of the 'Watering down" of teacher training standards, mostly by&#13;
more lucrative opportunities in the productive sectors. Teaching jobs around the world are&#13;
failing to attract the more academically qualified students not only because of the low&#13;

Factors," Comparative Education Review 24 (2): 206-220.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6: Page 4 of 8                               43&#13;
social status of the profession but also because of unattractive entry level salaries and poor&#13;
working conditions especially in the rural areas. In China and the Philippines, where&#13;
national entrance examinations are required for admission to university, lower scoring&#13;
examinees tend to apply to teachers colleges, where they are more likely to be accepted.&#13;
Similar behavior has been observed in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand,&#13;
Malaysia, and Korea. Interventions for the improvement of quality of training would seem&#13;
sensible, in order to attract bright students to the profession. Larger issues of&#13;
compensation and working conditions, admission standards into LPTKs were reviewed&#13;
and assessed during project preparation as follows.&#13;
Raising teachers' salaries. In developed countries such as the United States, it is&#13;
argued that salaries are the most important determinant of teacher quality. Salary&#13;
schedules are designed to reward years of formal education and degrees earned,&#13;
experience and certification. For financially strapped developing countries, however,&#13;
significantly raising teacher salaries relative to those of other professions is not a real&#13;
option9. It was assessed during preparation that for Indonesia which tie the teacher salary&#13;
scale to certain grades of the uniform salary schedule of the civil service, it would be&#13;
unrealistic (at this time) to expect that teachers' salaries can be improved without&#13;
disrupting those of the rest of the national civil service system.&#13;
Provide inservice training only. An option for raising teacher quality in countries&#13;
where salary scales for teachers are inseparable from those of civil servants is to recruit&#13;
from the less well-educated and invest more in inservice training, using a variety of&#13;
programs including on-campus training at teacher training institutions, distance education,&#13;
seminars and programs to upgrade the quality of existing teachers. It was judged that this&#13;
option, while cost-effective for the short-term, sacrifices the long-term sustainability of&#13;
quality teacher training particularly during a national expansion of secondary education.&#13;
Including preservice programs (more efficiently provided) and inservice programs in the&#13;
project interventions would be a more cost-effective choice for Indonesia's current stage&#13;
in secondary school teacher development.&#13;
Raising admission requirements. One way to improve the quality of teachers is to&#13;
simply raise the academic requirements for entrance to the teacher training institutions.&#13;
This option needs to be approached with caution. Leaders in Korea, a country with a&#13;
highly competitive system of entrance examinations, are beginning to question whether&#13;
theirs is really the best method of recruiting teachers, since tests fail to detect important&#13;
aspects of teacher aptitude such as personality and commitment to a teaching career.&#13;
Thailand has established a three-part entrance test that covers subject knowledge, attitude&#13;
toward the teaching profession, and general knowledge. Malaysia has a two-part&#13;
examination that screens candidates through a scholastic aptitude test and requires the&#13;
successful takers to undergo an interview. In Indonesia, the entrance examination scores&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6: Page 5 of 8&#13;

of applicants to teacher training are so low (betraying inadequate preparation at secondary&#13;
school) that simply raising the cut-off mark for admission would merely eliminate most&#13;
applicants who are otherwise trainable. Nevertheless, a few public teacher education&#13;
institutions are sought by students for excellence in selected fields, so that competition for&#13;
admission to those institutions has become very keen. The project supports the alternative&#13;
of raising admission standards incrementally, improving the quality of student intake over&#13;
time, without risking any rash elimination of potential pools of candidates.&#13;
Relating classroom experience to teacher training. Research suggests that the&#13;
length of teaching experience is a key teacher characteristic determining student&#13;
achievement. Indonesia teacher training candidates need more practical teaching&#13;
experiences with mentor classroom teachers, and less lecturing by faculty who have had&#13;
little or no classroom teaching experience. Research in the Middle East and in parts of&#13;
Africa have found that experienced teachers are more participatory and less authoritarian&#13;
in their teaching practices. Other research show that student teachers come closer to the&#13;
patterns of teachers with more experience in the classrooms at exit compared to student&#13;
teachers who practice with less experienced teachers. The optimum level of classroom&#13;
experience for teacher trainers ranges from 10 to 20 years"0. This option has been selected&#13;
for the proposed project as part of improving preservice teacher education.&#13;
Are the selected alternatives sensitive to effective teaching practices?&#13;
The proposed project invests in a new mix of teacher education inputs, including&#13;
those critical to the training of teachers for the expanded nine-year basic education&#13;
program: curriculum development and strengthening the teacher education institution's&#13;
linkage to secondary schools. Among the Govern ment's innovative approaches to increase&#13;
the participation rate in secondary education are the SMP kecil (very small junior&#13;
secondary schools established to serve remote rural areas) and SMP terbuka (junior&#13;
secondary instruction through distance education to reach those living in areas where the&#13;
population is sparse and widely dispersed). Teaching for these types of schools requires&#13;
teacher flexibility with regard to subject matter assignments and instructional techniques,&#13;
areas not adequately covered in the current teacher education curriculum which prescribes&#13;
training along rigid, disciplinary lines. The proposed project would develop curricula in&#13;
subject areas and in pedagogy that would be responsive to the new educational demands.&#13;
At the same time, the proposed project would assist the teacher education&#13;
institution to create and strengthen linkages with secondary schools. The faculty of the&#13;
teacher education institution would collaborate with secondary school teachers in&#13;
conducting research about secondary education in their own schools, send student-&#13;
teachers to secondary schools for teaching practicum, and the faculty themselves would&#13;
periodically renew their teaching experience in secondary schools. These activities would&#13;
enable the 'teacher producers" to 'know their market," i.e., become rooted in the realities&#13;

and be responsive to the needs of secondary schools in their area, for which they prepare&#13;
teachers.&#13;
Is the investmenr fiscally wise? Are its fiscal implications bearable?&#13;
Efficiency gains and sustainability. The Government has decided to raise the&#13;
student-staff ratio at public teacher education institutions from its current average of&#13;
9.9:1 to the university average of 12:1. Full implementation of this policy would free up&#13;
to 2,400 teacher educators who, on a rotational basis, would be asked to return to&#13;
secondary schools as teachers or to serve as tutors in the field for the various distance&#13;
education courses of the Open University (UT). The savings to the national education&#13;
system for not having to hire additional secondary school teachers or distance education&#13;
tutors is estimated at US$4.7 million per year. In addition, with the project, the rotation of&#13;
excess teaching staff would preclude the need for additional office and conference space at&#13;
teacher education institutions, the provision of which would cost about US$7.9 million.&#13;
The savings would be greater because corresponding maintenance and operating costs&#13;
would also be reduced. On the other hand, the incremental recurrent costs (salaries for&#13;
new staff, operating expenditures, and building and equipment maintenance) to be&#13;
generated by the project is about US$2.3 million, equivalent to only 3.5 percent of the&#13;
annual recurrent budget of the education ministry's higher education directorate-general.&#13;
(The assumptions and calculations of the above are discussed in (Annex 17.)&#13;
Cost recovery. The fee policy for the teacher training system is sound. Teacher&#13;
education institutions charge tuition and other fees and are able to generate modest&#13;
incomes from consulting and similar service contracts. Public teacher education&#13;
institutions are able to recover about 13 percent of their total annual budget, only slightly&#13;
lower than the 17 percent average recovery of all higher education institutions in&#13;
Indonesia. As a percentage of annual total recurrent expenditure, however, the fees&#13;
charged by public teacher education institutions averaged 19 percent over the last five&#13;
years (1991-95), the same level estimated for all of higher education in 1994.&#13;
What economic returns can be expectedfrom this project?&#13;
Cost-benefit analysis. Evidence of the benefits of teacher development are clearly&#13;
confirmed in international and Indonesian educational research as presented above. Lack&#13;
of Indonesian data has prohibited a cost-benefit analysis to date; however, the project will&#13;
collect data during its life to assess benefits (including project impact and cost-&#13;
effectiveness) through the Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (PBME), a subunit&#13;
of the central Project Implementation Unit (PIU).&#13;
Rates of return. Indonesia is joining East Asia's high-growth countries that invest&#13;
heavily in both primary and secondary education in an effort to enhance the quality of&#13;
labor. While circumstances in each country differ, the general pattern has been that in&#13;
economies with less than universal basic education, rates of return are greatest for primary&#13;
education, followed by secondary education. The social rates of return to secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46                              Annex 6: Page 7 of 8&#13;
schools in Asia is approximately 13 percent"1. Other analyses"2 show that economies with&#13;
universal primary education that have undergone rapid growth tend to have a higher rate&#13;
of return to secondary than to primary education. The social rates of return to junior&#13;
secondary education in Indonesia have been estimated at 11-14 percent in urban areas,&#13;
higher than the benchmark of 10 percent return for capital investment. These rates for&#13;
urban areas imply that the returns in rural areas may be even higher'3. During the course&#13;
of implementation of the proposed project, data will be collected for calculating the rates&#13;
of return to teacher education.&#13;
Internal efficiency. Project interventions will raise the professional capacity of&#13;
teacher educators, leading to improvements in educational quality as well as student&#13;
achievement. The following activities will contribute directly to these outcomes: in-&#13;
country and overseas fellowships, improved preservice and inservice prograrns, linking&#13;
teacher training institutions to secondary schools, and building research capacity. These&#13;
interventions are positively correlated with improved student performance'4. The project&#13;
will also raise the student staff ratio in the public teacher education institutions,&#13;
contributing to internal efficiencies in per-pupil spending.&#13;
External efficiency. The project will meet the external demand for teachers created&#13;
as a result of the expansion in junior secondary enrollment. Project interventions will&#13;
enhance training, to enable graduates to find employment in secondary schools or&#13;
elsewhere, through tutoring during formal coursework, mentoring during practice&#13;
teaching, and making infornation on teacher supply and demand available to their own&#13;
institution, schools, and the provincial teacher recruitment authorities.&#13;
Are the project's institutional arrangements sound?&#13;
The Government's higher education directorate-general of the education ministry&#13;
has the requisite management experience, having managed many education development&#13;
projects, including 10 World Bank-supported projects in postsecondary education, four of&#13;
them in teacher education, since 1976. Currently, there are three Bank-financed&#13;
postsecondary projects under active implementation, including the Primary School&#13;
Teacher Development Project (Loan No. 3496-IND). For the proposed project, a central&#13;

project implementation unit would be established at the directorate-general, and small&#13;
local implementation units would be organized at the public teacher education&#13;
institutions (paras. 3.25-27).&#13;
To address the issue of teacher demand and supply determination, which has&#13;
serious implications on teacher education, recruitment, and deployment, the Govemment&#13;
has established a Coordinating Forum that would bring together the various&#13;
governmental authorities involved, principally the directorates-general of primary and&#13;
secondary and of higher education. A Joint Secretariat will be established with an action&#13;
plan for ensuring that secondary schools, teacher education institutions, provincial-level&#13;
education authorities are brought into the dialogue (Annex 9).&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
Strengthening Linkages Between LPTKs and Secondary Schools&#13;
1.    The study teams which visited teacher education institutions abroad in 1995 found&#13;
that there are strong links between the institutions and the schools. Teacher educators&#13;
routinely have had teaching experience in schools prior to teaching at the university level&#13;
and in some instances are required to update their experience every five years by spending&#13;
as much as a year as a classroom teacher. The pre-service teacher education programs&#13;
include early field-based experiences connected to courses throughout the pre-service&#13;
student's program and it is not unusual for a teacher candidate to spend several months in&#13;
school settings prior to the student teaching experience (which is at least one semester&#13;
full-time in length and in some cases a fuill year).&#13;
2.    Often teacher education programs are collaboratively designed by school teachers&#13;
and college faculty with each group having equal input into the teacher education&#13;
curriculum. School teachers may teach courses in the preservice teacher education&#13;
program as well as in the in-service programs. In turn, teacher educators are active in the&#13;
schools as researchers, in the in-service teacher education programs, and in the&#13;
professional deveiopment activities for school renewal.&#13;
3.    In Indonesia such exchanges between schools and LPTKs are rare. For the&#13;
improvement of the secondary schools themselves as well as the improvement of the&#13;
teacher education programs at LPTKs, it is important that supportive, cooperative&#13;
relationships be developed between the schools and LPTKs. Activities supported under&#13;
the project would include: (i) a study team to design a program for implementing a one&#13;
semester student teaching experience in LPTKs, (ii) small grants to support partnerships&#13;
between LPTKs and schools, (iii) grants to support school-based action research, and (iv)&#13;
support for establishing partnerships between an LPTK and a foreign institution which has&#13;
a strong field-based teacher education program.&#13;
Study Team&#13;
4.    The PIU would identify a five (5) member team composed of three representatives&#13;
from an LPTK which has a strong student teaching program and two (2) members from&#13;
two other LPTKs.&#13;
5.    The study team would be responsible for formulating concrete suggestions for a&#13;
practical plan to implement a one semester, full-time student teaching experience in&#13;
LPTKs. The study team would address issues such as the number of classes the student&#13;
teachers would be responsible for teaching each day, how the student teacher is oriented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50                         Annex 8: Page 2 of 4&#13;
to the school, the selection of cooperating teachers, incentives for cooperating teachers,&#13;
number of formal observations by LPTK supervisor, incentives for LPTK staff, student&#13;
teaching experience at two levels (one at SMP and one at SMA), and guidelines for&#13;
conferences among the student teacher, cooperating teacher and LPTK supervisor. This is&#13;
not an inclusive or exclusive list of suggestions. The main objective of the study team is to&#13;
come up with a concrete plan for a full-time, one semester student teaching experience&#13;
that can be implemented under normal and sustainable conditions independent of outside&#13;
funding sources.&#13;
6.    To accomplish the task, the study team would establish a meeting plan and work&#13;
schedule which would include visits to schools to obtain input from administrators and&#13;
teachers. They would also be responsible for sharing the plan with LPTKs, Kanwils, and&#13;
teachers at regional meetings to obtain feedback for revision. The final product would be&#13;
a handbook for the student teaching experience which would be distributed to all LPTKs.&#13;
Suggested Activities:&#13;
*  correspondence to the LPTKs and Kanwils from appropriate Directorate describing&#13;
the purpose of the study team&#13;
v  selection of team members&#13;
*  field visits to LPTKs, Kanwils, SMPs, and SMAs for input&#13;
*  drafting handbook&#13;
*  regional meetings to share draft&#13;
X  revision for field trials&#13;
&#149;  field trials for handbook&#13;
*  regional meetings to share feedback on trial handbook&#13;
*  revision and dissemination of handbook&#13;
Small Grants to Facilitate LPTK-School Linkages&#13;
7.    Grant funds would be available to 31 LPTKs and partnership schools based on a&#13;
collaborative proposal submitted by the partnership. The grants would facilitate the&#13;
implementation of programs which focus specifically on improving field-based experiences&#13;
for pre-service teachers conducted by LPTKs and schools. Proposals would be expected&#13;
to include, but not be limited to, activities such as: how to select and train supervising&#13;
teachers; systems for field experiences prior to student teaching; evaluating and grading&#13;
student teachers; and, developing conferencing skills. A required criteria for a funded&#13;
proposal is parity between the LPTK and the school(s). The Director General of Higher&#13;
Education and the Director General of Primary and Secondary Education (the Director of&#13;
General Secondary School in particular), would invite all LPTKs and Kanwils to explore&#13;
developing LPTK-school linkages and potential LPTK-school partnerships.&#13;
Representatives from the potential partnerships would be invited to a proposal writing&#13;
workshop. Proposals would be developed by the partnerships and submitted to the PIU&#13;
for selection. An important aspect of successful proposals would be mechanisms for how&#13;
the partnership would be sustained after grant funds have expired. At least one of the 31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8: Page 3 of4                              51&#13;
grant proposals (more than one if appropriate) would be specifically for developing a valid&#13;
evaluation system for the assessment of student teaching performance which would be&#13;
used under Quality Assurances (Component 4).&#13;
Suggested Activities:&#13;
*  DGHE shares small grant plan with DGPSE&#13;
*  invitation to LPTKs, Kanwils, schools to form partnerships&#13;
*  small funds (from grant funds) provided to LPTKs/Kanwils to explore partnerships&#13;
*  partnerships invited to proposal workshop&#13;
*  proposal workshop&#13;
*  proposal development by LPTK-school partnership&#13;
*  proposals submitted to PIU for selection&#13;
*  grants awarded to partnerships&#13;
*  monitoring and evaluation&#13;
*  publication/sharing of results&#13;
School-based Action Research&#13;
8.    There has been little school-based action research collaboration between LPTK&#13;
faculty and secondary school teachers. Small grants would provide funds to lecturer-&#13;
teacher teams in the conduct of school-based action research. The program would run for&#13;
three years, with awards going to five teams per year, with preference to those focusing&#13;
on the SMP level. Grants would be for one year, with the possibility of extending to a&#13;
second year. Each year would have a theme:&#13;
- year I secondary school students' learning problems, errors and misconceptions;&#13;
D year 2 problems and issues related to student teaching; and&#13;
3 year 3 problems and adjustments of novice teachers during induction years.&#13;
9.    All proposals would be required to identify teacher partners for whom important,&#13;
substantive research and action roles are specified. Proposals would be encouraged from&#13;
lecturers who are involved in their LPTK-school linkage program. Support would be&#13;
provided for the publication of research results in international or local journals so that&#13;
action research methods and findings would be widely disseminated and used. This&#13;
program would be managed by a Research Management Unit set up at one of the LPTKs&#13;
similar to the research management unit established under the Primary School&#13;
Development Project.&#13;
Suggested Activities:&#13;
*  foreign and national consultants for drafting TOR (guidelines for proposals)&#13;
*  training and proposal workshops&#13;
*  selection of recipients&#13;
*  funds for research&#13;
*  mid-term workshops&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52                             Annex 8: Page 4 of 4&#13;
* monitoring&#13;
* local workshops&#13;
* regional workshops&#13;
* publication facilitation&#13;
10.   These activities would be repeated for a total of 3 cycles, 5 school-based action&#13;
research proposals each year for a total of 15.&#13;
Partnerships with Foreign Institutions&#13;
11.   To further strengthen experienced-based teacher education programs and linkages&#13;
to schools, LPTKs would have the opportunity to form a partnership with a foreign&#13;
institution which has well established, collaborative teacher education programs with&#13;
schools. The project would support eight partnerships which include, but not be lirnited&#13;
to, activities such as the exchange of faculty between institutions, short study tours for&#13;
faculty and school teachers in partnership institutions, short study tours for faculty and&#13;
school teachers in partnership institutions, seminars, and workshops.&#13;
Suggested Activities:&#13;
- PIU develops guidelines for partnerships&#13;
* DGHE informs LPTKs of partnerships and guidelines&#13;
* meetings to explain proposals&#13;
* small funds given to LPTKs to negotiate partnership and write proposal which would&#13;
include a formal agreement between LPTK and proposed foreign institution&#13;
- proposals submitted to PIU for selection&#13;
* funds to successful LPTKs for implementation&#13;
* monitoring by PIU&#13;

Secondary School Teacher Development Project&#13;
Coordinating the Training, Recruitment, and Appointment of Teachers&#13;
Background&#13;
Shortly after the nine-year basic education policy, including junior secondary education&#13;
with the six-year primary education, was introduced in 1989, the Ministry of Education and&#13;
Culture (MOEC) issued Decree No. 0461/U/1990 to: (i) raise the quality of educational&#13;
programs; (ii) raise the quality of teachers as well as the quality of the students who train to&#13;
become teachers; and (iii) develop a coordination mechanism to balance teacher supply and&#13;
demand. Although Indonesia's educational policy during 1969-1994 had been successful in&#13;
increasing the enrollment rate of primary education a disequilibrium in teacher supply and&#13;
demand had become a problem particularly in primary education due to: (i) an over-complex&#13;
process of teacher recruitment and placement involving multiple Government agencies both at&#13;
the central and local levels, and (ii) a change in management responsibility which moved teacher&#13;
training from the Directorate-General of Primary and Secondary Education (DGPSE) to the&#13;
Directorate-General of Higher Education (DGHE). The decree was issued specifically to avoid&#13;
problems in teacher supply and demand during the expansion of secondary schools in order not&#13;
to repeat the problems faced by primary education.&#13;
The Coordination Forum&#13;
Under this decree, a Coordination Forum was established in 1990 among the three&#13;
agencies of MOEC that are directly involved in the development and deployment of teachers:&#13;
DGHE, DGPSE, and the Secretariat-General of MOEC. The Coordination Forum functions the&#13;
deployment and development of teachers including the related aspects of trainee recruitment,&#13;
post-training appointment, placement, as well as inservice training and career development of&#13;
teachers.&#13;
(a)   Central Policy Coordination Forum. Also known as the Central Directional&#13;
Forum (CDF), is a body of national representatives for policy and program&#13;
development. Representatives include the following:  Secretary General of&#13;
MOEC; Director-General, Director, and Secretary of DGHE; Director-General,&#13;
Director, and Secretary of DGPSE; Chairperson and Secretary of the Office of&#13;
Education and Culture Research &amp; Development; Director of General Secondary&#13;
Education; Director of Academic Affairs; Director of Private Higher Educational&#13;
Institutions; Chairperson of Personnel Bureau; Chairperson of Planning Bureau;&#13;
Chairperson of Finance Bureau; Chairperson of Education and Training Center;&#13;
Chairperson of Information Center. As appropriate, the Coordination Forum can&#13;
invite the Chairpersons from the following agencies on an ad-hoc basis: Civil&#13;

Administrative Reform (MENPAN). A Joint Secretariat supports the activities of&#13;
the CDF.&#13;
(b)   The Provincial Coordination Forum for Policies of Program Implementation).&#13;
The PCDFPI investigates the problems related to imbalances in teacher supply and&#13;
demand and teacher development within the region according to the directives of&#13;
the central administration the policies developed. The Head of the Provincial&#13;
Office of MOEC, Head of Provincial Administration of MOEC, Rectors of&#13;
LPTKs, Head of the Units of Distance Learning Programs, and related units at the&#13;
provincial level are represented in this forum.&#13;
(c)   District(Kabupaten) /Municipal Coordination Forum for Program&#13;
Implementation (DMCFPI). The Office of MOEC and related units at the district&#13;
level are represented in this forum.&#13;
Functions of the Coordination Forum&#13;
The function of the Coordination Forum is to identify and discuss various alternatives to&#13;
the problems related to teacher supply and the development of teacher training programs such as:&#13;
(a)   Student admission, and student distribution in LPTKs in accordance with the&#13;
actual demand of teachers.&#13;
(b)   Implementation of preservice training, including teaching practicum for&#13;

(c)   Scholarship provision in accordance with students' needs and academic&#13;
performance;&#13;
(d)   Teacher placement and inservice training;&#13;
(e)   Staff and career development, including in-service and continuing education in&#13;
subject matter and pedagogy.&#13;
In the Coordination Forum relevant MOEC units at the central, provincial, and&#13;
kabupaten/municipal levels meet to discuss educational policy, make recommendations and to&#13;
coordinate activities related to the supply, deployment, and development of teachers. Decision-&#13;
making authority and responsibility for implementation remain in the relevant units of MOEC.&#13;
The Joint Secretariat&#13;
The task of the Joint Secretariat is to identify problems in teacher distribution and to&#13;
recommend policy alternatives. The Executive Unit of the Joint Secretariat will consist of the&#13;
Chairman, Executive Secretary, and two assistants although it can count on the support of related&#13;
Government units. The Secretariat will be chaired by the Director of Academic Affairs of DGHE&#13;
who reports directly to the Director General of DGHE (who also heads the Secondary School&#13;
Teacher Development Project). Logistical assistance to the Joint Secretariat will also be provided&#13;
&#13;

by DGHE. (The Bank-assisted project will have a strong link to the Coordination Forum through&#13;
the leaders of the Joint Secretariat).&#13;
A larger Plenary Joint Secretariat will include the members of the executive board and the&#13;
following 10 representative of the Government: Secretary of DGHE, Secretary of DGPSE,&#13;
Directorate of Teacher and Technical Manpower Training, Directorate of Primary Education,.&#13;
Directorate of General Secondary Education, Directorate of Secondary Education, Directorate of&#13;
Secondary Vocational Education, Directorate of Academic Affairs, Bureau of Personnel, Bureau&#13;
of Educational Planning and BAPPENAS.&#13;
The Role of Central Project Implementation Unit (PIU)&#13;
Within the Secondary School Teacher Development Project the PIU is expected to&#13;
function as a facilitator of CDF and PCDFPI once project implementation commences. When&#13;
deemed necessary, the Secondary School Teacher Development Project will support the meetings&#13;
in the central office as well as regional meetings. The PIU and the Joint Secretariat will work&#13;
together. Reports prepared by the Joint Secretariat as the result of the Coordination Forum&#13;
meetings will be shared with the World Bank through the PIU.&#13;
Current Status and Outputs&#13;
The issues raised during the preparation of the Secondary School Teacher Development&#13;
Project highlighted the need for  the Coordination Forum. Two recent meetings of the&#13;
Coordination Forum have advanced the dialogue between DGHE and DGPSE.&#13;
The Coordination of In-Service Training. Two Core Meetings took place to discuss&#13;
inservice training, an area where there is a lot of overlap. Attending the meeting of November 8,&#13;
1995 were the Director Generals of DGHE and DGPSE and their staffs. The Coordination Forum&#13;
developed a work plan at this meeting which includes:&#13;
(a)   forming the Joint Secretariat,&#13;
(b)   identifying problems faced by both Directorates,&#13;
(c)   prioritizing problems, and&#13;
(d)   establishing a plan of action.&#13;
A second meeting was conducted on December 27, 1995. The participants were the same&#13;
as the previous meeting. A decision was reached that overlapping inservice training would be&#13;
avoided between DGHE and DGPSE.&#13;
Organization of 8 Regional Forums. There will be 27 Coordination Forums to represent&#13;
each of the 27 provinces. In order to conduct more efficient meetings, a plan will be adopted to&#13;
group the 27 provinces into 8 regions (Attachment During fiscal year 1996/1997 one meeting of&#13;
each of the eight Regional Coordination Forums is scheduled to take place. The agenda for the&#13;
Regional Forums will focus on teacher allocation and placement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Teacher Allocation. The key task of each Coordination Forum at the province level will be&#13;
to realistically identify the number of teachers needed the public secondary schools in each field of&#13;
study. This information will be obtained from each Kanwil and discussed with the LPTK in the&#13;
Regional Forums. The demand for secondary school teachers will be determined by regions&#13;
according to actual intake into the LPTKs. Criteria for the recruitment of teachers will also be&#13;
elaborated in the regional meetings. Policy recommendations stemming from these meetings&#13;
include fellowship for students from rural or remote areas (Attachment).&#13;
Action Plan for the Coordination Forum.&#13;
The action plan for the Coordination Forum will deal with the following problems:&#13;
(a)   Planning and management of a national information system on teacher openings&#13;
and surpluses,&#13;
(b)   Limiting the number of new entrants to LPTKs based upon the demand of&#13;
teachers. Such indicators as the entrants' field of study, their geographic region of&#13;
origin, and the government's capability to provide a teaching appointment will be&#13;
used to improve the selection process,&#13;
(c)   Implementing improved pre-service education and teaching practicums to fulfill&#13;
the expectation and need of the schools,&#13;
(d)    Sharing educational resources among the MOEC agencies,&#13;
(e)    Evaluating, assigning, and placing new graduates of the teacher development&#13;
programs, and&#13;
(f)   Conducting effective staff development workshops using in-service training and&#13;
continuing education.&#13;

Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Presented in this annex is an overview of monitoring and evaluation for the&#13;
project, including indicators by project component and sub-components to guide&#13;
summative and formative evaluations as well as monitoring and supervision. The&#13;
Ministry of Fducation and Culture (MOEC) will establish a Project Benefit Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation (PBME) unit at the Central Project Implementation Unit. This unit will be&#13;
comprised of one or two staff who would perform project monitoring and coordinate&#13;
evaluation activities. Collecting and supplying data for monitoring and evaluation will be&#13;
the responsibility of the Central Project Implementation Unit for the overall project and&#13;
Local Project Implementation Unit for activities at institutional sites.&#13;
Following are the detailed performance indicators. Part I displays the project&#13;
overview with performance indicators for summative evaluation to be used at project&#13;
completion. Part II, displays detailed performance indicators for monitoring, formative&#13;
evaluation and supervision for use during project implementation.&#13;
Definitions&#13;
Monitoring is the process of tracking project activities to determine if they are&#13;
being implemented as planned. Information from supervisory visits, routine visits and&#13;
reports from  sites and task teams,  and periodic project reviews are sources for&#13;
monitoring information which can be fed into the evaluation process particularly at the&#13;
formative stage to allow for adjustment of activities and timeframes.&#13;
Formative evaluation occurs during development and implementation of a project&#13;
or set of activities which are part of a project. It is used to determine how well the&#13;
individual activities are being accomplished compared to themselves. Formative&#13;
evaluation provides immediate feedback for improvement and correction. This type of&#13;
evaluation is invaluable to curriculum design and development which takes place over&#13;
several years and involves continuous revision and refinement.&#13;
Summative evaluation occurs at project completion. It attempts to provide an&#13;
answer to how well the overall objective(s) was accomplished. In formative and&#13;
summative evaluation the same instruments may be used. It is how the results are fed&#13;
back into the system that determines the distinction between the two types of evaluation.&#13;

Project Efficiency and Sustainability&#13;
Improving Efficiency of LPTKs&#13;
Raising student-teacher ratio of the LPTKs&#13;
1.    The need to improve the efficiency of public LPTKs in Indonesia is demonstrated&#13;
with two frequently used indicators: student-teacher ratio and unit cost. As of 1994-95,&#13;
the 30 public LPTKs (excluding FKIP of the Open University) enroll 138,577 students in&#13;
their diploma and degree programs, and employ a total of 13,971 teaching staff, averaging&#13;
9.9 students per teaching staff. In contrast the overall student-teacher ratio of the entire&#13;
public higher education sector in Indonesia stands around 12:1, about 21% higher than the&#13;
LPTKs. This ratio varies widely among both the IKIPs/STKIPs and the FKIPs. While it is&#13;
12:1 for IKIP Jakarta, it is 5:1 and below for IKIP Manado and STKIP Gorontalo (Table&#13;
1). The ratio for the 19 FKIPs on average is slightly higher than the IKIPs/STKIPs, and&#13;
has an even larger variation.&#13;

2.    One measure of unit cost in education is the per student expenditure. Table 1 also&#13;
displays the per student total expenditure and routine budget for the IKIPs/STKIPs. The&#13;
institutions with the lowest student-teacher ratios have the highest per student total&#13;
spending and routine budget. Except for IKIP Ujung Pandang, all the other institutions&#13;
whose student teacher-ratios are below 8.7:1 have higher-than-average per student&#13;
spending. Since LPTKs spend more than half of their expenditures on staff salaries, the&#13;
low student-teacher ratio and high unit cost indicate that resources can be saved by raising&#13;
the student-teacher ratio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17: Page 2 of 5                          89&#13;
3.    A very important factor to consider is quality when the efficiency of the LPTKs is&#13;
examined. If an institution with above-the-average resources used such resources&#13;
appropriately to improve its quality of teaching and research, and support well-designed&#13;
activities to provide students with a better educational experience, the high per student&#13;
spending might be justified. This is not the case with the LPTKs. Although there is no&#13;
systematic measurement of the quality of programs of the 12 public IKIPs/STKIPs and the&#13;
19 FKLPs, general perception suggests that the IKIPs/STKIPs with highest per student&#13;
spending do not necessarily offer the strongest programs. As a matter of fact, some of the&#13;
institutions with perceived high quality programs, such as IKIPs Bandung and Malang,&#13;
have lower-than-average per student spending. This points to the direction where the&#13;
efficiency of the LPTKs can be improved and resources saved.&#13;
4.    The Government has decided to raise the student-teacher ratio of the LPTKs to&#13;
12:1 over the period of the project, the average level for public universities in Indonesia.&#13;
The long term target is 15:1. The excess teaching staff would be assigned to secondary&#13;
schools and the Open University's inservice teacher training programs. This redeployment&#13;
would greatly enhance the capacity of the secondary schools since currently the majority&#13;
of the teachers in these schools are underqualified. It would also increase the access to&#13;
tutoring for the distance inservice teacher training programs of the Open University. These&#13;
programs provide courses to primary and secondary school teachers to upgrade their&#13;
qualifications and are rapidly expanding. In 1994-95 alone, they took 12,600 such&#13;
teachers. Currently, it offers programs in three areas of study: English, math and sciences.&#13;
The University hires lecturers from other universities as tutors, meet with the inservice&#13;
teachers twice a week to answer questions and help them learn.&#13;
5.    The redeployment will generate cost savings, measured by the wages that would&#13;
be paid for the positions the excess teaching staff would be assigned to. Currently, the&#13;
annual salary of a typical teaching staff in an IKIP or a university is Rp. 5.66 million&#13;
(US$2,520), the amount paid to civil servants in category G-III (d) on government salary&#13;
schedule. This figure is appropriate for calculating the cost savings for assigning excess&#13;
teaching staff to the Open University's tutoring positions. SI degree holders who become&#13;
secondary school teachers earn a starting salary of Rp. 3 million (US$1,336) per year. The&#13;
total amount of cost savings can be estimated based on these figures, if we had&#13;
information on the proportions of the excess teaching staff to be assigned to the Open&#13;
University and to secondary schools. Such information is not available at present. Table 2&#13;
demonstrates the estimated cost savings, assuming half of the teaching staff would become&#13;
tutors at the Open University and half would become secondary school teachers. The table&#13;
shows that the redeployment would save a total of US$4.7 million per year if the student-&#13;
teacher ratio of the LPTKs is raised to 12:1. The savings would almost double when the&#13;
ratio is raised to 15:1 in the future.&#13;
&#13;

6.    Another unquantifiable, nevertheless important, benefit is more and stronger&#13;
linkages between the LPTKs and the secondary schools, which is among the primary goals&#13;
of the project.&#13;
Improving the efficiency of the project&#13;
7.    The reduction of the LPTK teaching staff will also improve the efficiency of the&#13;
project. Originally, it was estimated that office space and conference rooms were in&#13;
shortage for 6,000 LPTK teaching staff. It was proposed that about US$11.0 million&#13;
would be invested in building new offices and renovating existing facilities on an equal&#13;
basis in order to eliminate the shortage. Now that about 2,400 LPTK teaching staff would&#13;
be on assignment at secondary schools or the Open University, the number of spaces&#13;
needed would decrease from 6,000 to 3,600. As a result, the total estimated cost for&#13;
providing the offices and conference rooms by renovation would be reduced to about&#13;
US$3.1 million, generating nearly US$7.9 million in savings. The actual amount of savings&#13;
would be even larger after taking into account the maintenance expenditures that would be&#13;
necessary otherwise.&#13;
Sustainability of Project Interventions&#13;
Institutional sustainability&#13;
8.    Indonesia's human resource development strategy will provide very important&#13;
basis for the impact of the proposed project to sustain. Achieving the compulsory nine-&#13;
year basic education and improving quality are high priorities for the GOI. Recognizing&#13;
the critical role of quality teachers in achieving goals of educational development, the&#13;
Government will provide necessary support to the teacher training sector. The&#13;
Government's commitment to basic education and teacher training has been confirmed by&#13;
MENPAN's decision to allocate 25,000 new positions to MOEC for hiring in 1996-97&#13;
while in other government agencies the zero-growth policy in hiring civil servants is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17: Page 4 of 5                       91&#13;
strictly enforced. As secondary education expands, the capacity to absorb the new&#13;
graduates from LPTKs will be continuously strengthened.&#13;
9.    The LPTKs with strengthened capacity would also ensure that the impact of the&#13;
project will be sustained. The proposed project would provide assistance to the LPTKs to&#13;
establish quality assurance and accreditation mechanisms. These measures would enhance&#13;
the ability of the LPTKs for self-examination and ensure that the institutions will&#13;
continuously strive for quality improvement. The project would make teacher education's&#13;
link to secondary schools through practice teaching and school-based action research a&#13;
permanent feature of the LPTKs, enhancing the sustainability of the project impact. By&#13;
raising the student-teacher ratio, the LPTKs would free up resources that could be used to&#13;
provide other inputs to improve instruction and research, thereby contributing to the goals&#13;
of the project.&#13;
Financial sustainability&#13;
10.   The total cost of the proposed project is Rp. 197 billion, or US$88 million, of&#13;
which US$61 million would be provided by the Bank. This amount would be invested&#13;
over a five-year period. The average annual investment represents 2.6% of the DGHE's&#13;
total budget. Investment in some of the activities would require additional recurrent&#13;
expenditure in order for their effect to be sustained. These activities are: (a) purchase of&#13;
equipment and library books, and providing offices and conference rooms; (b) upgrading&#13;
staff qualifications; and (c) supporting linkages to schools and research.&#13;
11.   Under the project, a total of US$19.9 million (or averaging nearly US$4 million&#13;
annually) would be invested in purchasing science equipment and library books, and&#13;
providing offices and conference rooms. Currently, funds for maintenance and operation&#13;
(OPF) of the LPTKs equal about 23% of the investments. If the LPTKs continue this level&#13;
of OPF spending, the new investment would require an additional US$0.9 million in&#13;
recurrent expenditure.&#13;
12.   The project would also provide scholarships to 1,750 LPTK lecturers to pursue&#13;
graduate studies toward S2/S3 degrees. LPTK lecturers with 5-year working experience&#13;
are usually in Group 111(b) on the government wage schedule. Assuming some of them&#13;
receive project scholarships to study toward an S2/S3 degree and others remain teaching&#13;
with an SI degree. Ten years later, those with an S2/S3 degree would move up the rank&#13;
faster and be most likely in Group IV (a). According to the same wage schedule,&#13;
individuals within this category and with 15 years of seniority would be paid Rp. 6.1&#13;
million. Those with an SI degree would most likely be in Group 111(d) and paid Rp. 5.7&#13;
million per year. The difference in annual salaries for 1,750 teaching staff would total&#13;
about Rp. 745 million, or US$0.3 million.&#13;
13.   The project would provide an annual average of US$1.1 million (total of US$5.7&#13;
million) to strengthen linkages to secondary schools (excluding that for establishing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

partnerships with foreign institutions) and strengthening educational research. In order for&#13;
the effects of these activities to be sustained, the same level of funding should be provided&#13;
by the Govermnent upon project completion.&#13;
14.   Table 3 shows that the estimated incremental recurrent expenditures total US$2.3&#13;
million in order for the project to sustain its impact. This amount represents about 3.5&#13;
percent of the current recurrent expenditure of the 12 IKIPs/STKIPs -- even lower if the&#13;
FKIPs are taken into account -- and about 0.6 percent of the DGHE recurrent budget&#13;
(Table 4). The incremental increase is small and unlikely to cause a financial burden to the&#13;
LPTKs or the DGHE.&#13;

15.   Indeed, the incremental increase in recurrent expenditure would be more than&#13;
offset by the savings realized by raising student-teacher ratio to 12:1: US$4.7 per year&#13;
from redeploying about 2,400 excess teaching staff to secondary schools and the Open&#13;
University and a one-time US$7.9 from scaled-down construction of office&#13;
accommodations. The Government has been urged to increase recurrent commitments to&#13;
individual LPTKs as a result of these savings and as an incentive for further increasing the&#13;
student-teacher ratio to 15:1.&#13;

            Development Project

        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the Secondary
            School Teacher Development Project is to enhance
            teaching-learning processes in secondary schools through the
            improvement of teacher education in 31 public teacher
            training institutions (LPTKs). The project will support
            activities in these institutions that promote quality and
            efficiency in the preservice and inservice programs; build
            educational research capacity; and enhance effective
            management. Further, the project will support activities to
            establish sustainable linkages between LTPKs and secondary
            schools and to define a wider mandate, toward conversion to
            university status for selected LTPKs. To achieve the above,
            the project will have the following components: 1) improving
            preservice and inservice teacher education; 2) strengthening
            linkages to secondary schools; 3) raising the qualifications
            of teacher educators; 4) building educational research
            capacity; and 5) preparing for a wider mandate.
