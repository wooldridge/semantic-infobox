TECHNICAL ANNEX FOR AN&#13;
EMERGENCY ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT&#13;
TO THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
A. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) has maintained&#13;
general macroeconomic stability since 1995, following a period of volatility and&#13;
deterioration of fiscal and external balances, that developed in the years after&#13;
independence in 1991. Inflation, which averaged well over 600 percent during 1992-94,&#13;
was held to an average of 2 percent during 1996-00, even with the impact on prices of a&#13;
new VAT in 2000. The fiscal deficit, which averaged almost 8 percent of GDP during&#13;
1992-94, was brought into approximate balance for the years 1996-2000. The disciplined&#13;
improvement in fiscal policies, coupled with a series of initial structural reforms and&#13;
price and trade liberalization, contributed to a turnaround in GDP growth, from an&#13;
average contraction of 3.7 percent per annum during 1992-94 to an average 3.0 percent&#13;
annual expansion during 1996-2000.&#13;
2.    2000 was the fifth consecutive year of growth for the economy of FYR&#13;
Macedonia; the fiscal accounts of general government registered a substantial surplus for&#13;
the first time; and inflation continued to be modest. Despite a setback related to the&#13;
Kosovo crisis in 1999, with trade disrupted and a slowdown in economic activity that&#13;
undercut tax revenues, the outcome for 2000 was strong, with economic growth&#13;
exceeding 4 percent. Compared with 1998, the country exported 6 percent more goods&#13;
and held more than twice as much in international reserves in US dollar terms during&#13;
2000. The government collected 6 percent of GDP more in revenues in 2000 than 2 years&#13;
before and retained almost 3 percent of GDP as a fiscal surplus.&#13;
3.    Policy reforms that had been stalled since before the elections of 1998 were taken&#13;
up in 2000-01. Sale or closure of remaining state owned enterprises progressed including&#13;
the sale of the country's largest bank. A VAT was put in place. Reforms of labor&#13;
regulations and the pension system and of company and banking laws were legislated.&#13;
Perhaps of greatest significance for the medium term, FYR Macedonia was the first&#13;
country in the Balkans to negotiate a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the&#13;
European Union, granting trade preferences and establishing a path for future closer&#13;
relations with European institutions. This progress allowed the government to secure a&#13;
three-year IMF arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and the&#13;
Extended Fund Facility and the Bank's Second Financial and Enterprise Sector&#13;
Adjustment Loan/Credit in late 2000.&#13;
The Emergency Situation and Its Impact&#13;
4.    The recently-ended civil conflict in FYR Macedonia has created an emergency&#13;
situation. Following a NATO-brokered ceasefire put in place on July 6, 2001, an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
internationally mediated peace agreement was signed on August 13, 2001 by the main&#13;
political parties in FYR Macedonia, representing ethnic Macedonians and ethnic&#13;
Albanians.  The parliament has ratified the peace agreement, by amending the&#13;
constitution to strengthen minority rights, a process partly coordinated with disarmament&#13;
assisted by NATO. The international community has expressed its strong backing of the&#13;
peace agreement and its willingness to provide financial resources in support of peace&#13;
building. Assessment of damages from the conflict is ongoing, with some preliminary&#13;
estimates emerging from the Government, UNHCR, the European Commission, and&#13;
others. The displacement of more than 140,000 persons by the conflict has created social&#13;
strains and humanitarian costs, and disruptions to the economy have undermined growth&#13;
and budget revenues while expenditure needs have risen sharply. The EU, UNHCR and&#13;
other UN agencies, some bilateral donors, and NGOs have already been providing&#13;
humanitarian aid, and an international donors' conference is expected to be scheduled&#13;
soon.&#13;
5.    The ethnic Albanian insurgency has severely undermined the country's&#13;
macroeconomic scenario for 2001, as trade and private financial flows have weakened&#13;
and foreign and domestic investment have plummeted. Security expenses coupled with&#13;
declining tax revenues have worsened the government's budget position by more than&#13;
8 percent of GDP for this year. The balance of payments has deteriorated sharply&#13;
because of trade disruptions and general uncertainty.  Official reserves losses are&#13;
projected to exceed US$ 200 million for the year. Despite some action by the authorities&#13;
to address the fiscal deficit and tighten monetary policy since the middle of the year,&#13;
issues of macroeconomic stability have reemerged and may not dissipate quickly since&#13;
the rebuilding of a stable multi-ethnic society is likely to take substantial time and&#13;
funding, with lingering uncertainty in the interim.&#13;
B. WORLD BANK RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS&#13;
6.    A Transitional Support Strategy (discussed by the Board on September 13, 2001,&#13;
Report no. 22628-MK), sets out a plan for rapid Bank intervention in the post-conflict&#13;
period. It was triggered on November 16, 2001 by the ratification of the August 2001&#13;
peace agreement. The Strategy covers primarily FY02 and adds a new post-conflict&#13;
agenda to existing objectives. The new priorities are: balance of payments needs;&#13;
reconstruction needs; strengthening of social cohesion and preventing of further conflict;&#13;
and decentralization of government functions to local governments. These supplement&#13;
ongoing support to economic transition and development priorities, including: alleviation&#13;
of poverty and development of human capital; private sector growth and job creation; and&#13;
enhancing the efficiency of the state. The Strategy proposed an emergency recovery&#13;
assistance project to assist with urgent financial needs.&#13;
C. THE PROPOSED EMERGENCY ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives and Rationale&#13;
7.    The proposed Emergency Economic Recovery Project, an emergency recovery&#13;
assistance credit, would help restore economic activity disrupted by the recent emergency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
through enhanced access by the private sector to critical imports. This operation is a key&#13;
component of the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy for the country.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
8.    The Credit will support the restoration of assets and production levels&#13;
immediately after the civil disturbances that seriously disrupted the borrower's economy&#13;
during 2001 by providing immediate financing for a positive list of imports identified as&#13;
necessary to an effective recovery program while supporting macroeconomic objectives&#13;
by providing financing for the budget. It will also encourage resource mobilization from&#13;
the donor community as a whole by setting an example of rapid assistance. The project&#13;
will provide assistance for a broad range of imports by the private sector, especially&#13;
imported production inputs and imported capital equipment, through the use of a positive&#13;
list. While this type of operation does not include conditionality linked to macroeconomic&#13;
policies, IDA/Bank monitoring of economic developments and close collaboration with&#13;
the IMF (under a staff-monitored program now in discussion) will help ensure adequate&#13;
macroeconomic and fiscal diligence on the part of the Government.&#13;
9.    The proposed credit would finance 100 percent of the delivered cost of eligible&#13;
imports by the private sector on the positive list, excluding import duties and taxes. No&#13;
disbursements will be made to cover used or luxury goods, military equipment, nuclear&#13;
reactors, or other dangerous or banned products. To accommodate the emergency nature&#13;
of the operation, accelerated and simplified processing has been used in preparing the&#13;
project.&#13;
10.   The project is not expected to have significant environmental impact since no&#13;
physical rehabilitation or civil works are included. To minimize the small potential risk&#13;
from indirect financing of private sector imports, products deemed to pose an&#13;
environmental risk, in view of limited institutional oversight capability, are excluded&#13;
from the positive list of imports to be financed. These exclusions consist of dangerous or&#13;
banned products. No safeguard policies of the Bank are triggered by this project.&#13;
11.   The IDA Credit is proposed to be SDR 11.6 million (US$ 15 million equivalent),&#13;
based on an assessment of the country's requirements after considering other sources of&#13;
financing. As proposed in the Transitional Support Strategy, in recognition of the highly&#13;
exceptional nature of FYR Macedonia's access to IDA resources, the operation will have&#13;
a final maturity of 20 years, with 10 years of grace, and carry the standard IDA service&#13;
charge of 75 basis points. No acceleration clause will be included in the credit&#13;
agreement.&#13;
Benefits and Risks&#13;
12.   The import financing under the proposed credit will provide timely support to the&#13;
balance of payments and to the budget to allow for critical imports and to allow for&#13;
necessary govenment expenditure despite smaller private external financing flows and&#13;
lower budget revenues. The major risk is that growth may fail to recover, with continued&#13;
pressure on the fiscal deficit, which would require additional resources from the&#13;
international donor community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization and Management&#13;
13.   The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance in close collaboration&#13;
with the National Bank, both of which will sign an implementation agreement, detailing&#13;
responsibilities with respect to the Project. The management of the Project will be very&#13;
similar to that used for an earlier emergency operation, the Emergency Recovery Credit&#13;
(MK-PE-65834). The Project will finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of&#13;
private sector imports from a positive list agreed with the Government during&#13;
negotiations. General withdrawal procedures will be used for disbursements.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
14.   Consistent with the emergency nature of this recovery assistance, implementation&#13;
arrangements have been simplified. To ensure due diligence and sound governance, tie&#13;
arrangements would seek to ensure:&#13;
(a) that the Credit proceeds are used only to finance imports of items contained in the&#13;
list of imports permissible under the Credit;&#13;
(b) proper procedures on procurement and accounting and complete documentation&#13;
of transactions; and&#13;
(c) provision of management information using suitable monitoring and audit tools.&#13;
15.   The Ministry of Finance and the National Bank will sign an implementation&#13;
agreement, satisfactory to IDA, defining the assistance to be provided by each entity.&#13;
The Ministry of Finance will:&#13;
(a) authorize the National Bank to administer and execute the Project;&#13;
(b) create monthly progress reports and assist in the creation of monthly financial&#13;
management reports; and&#13;
(c) appoint independent private auditors to carry out the final audit at completion of&#13;
the Project.&#13;
16.   The National Bank will:&#13;
(a) manage project accounts using appropriate financial management systems and&#13;
provide accountable and timely financial information on project financing and&#13;
expenditures;&#13;
(b) prepare disbursement requests;&#13;
(c) maintain documentation in connection with eligible imports and make&#13;
documentation available to independent auditors and IDA representatives;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
(d) prepare and submit monthly financial management reports; and&#13;
(e) facilitate the work of the independent auditor.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
17.   The Credit proceeds would finance private sector imports against documentation&#13;
evidencing that the imported goods were on the positive list of imports agreed during&#13;
negotiations. This list is based on major items imported by the private sector in the last&#13;
two years. Used or luxury goods, military equipment, nuclear reactors, and other&#13;
dangerous or banned products are not included on the positive list. Credit proceeds&#13;
would be limited to goods from eligible countries under the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines (Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995,&#13;
revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999), and are also&#13;
participating countries under current IDA Guidelines. No more than 50 percent of the&#13;
Credit would be used in the aggregate for the import of any single item on the positive&#13;
list of imports. To avoid high overhead transaction costs for IDA, financing would be&#13;
restricted to contracts $20,000 or above.&#13;
18.   In addition to the foregoing, the Credit would only finance imports procured by&#13;
the private sector in accordance with procedures presented in Table 1. Prior review&#13;
thresholds (which require procurement documentation to be submitted to the Bank ex&#13;
ante) will be set at the same level as the thresholds for procurement method.&#13;
Table 1. Summary of Procurement Procedures for Items on the Positive List&#13;
Procurement Category                     Procurement Method&#13;
Through established commodity markets, or&#13;
Commodities for private sector contracts  other channels of competitive procurement as&#13;
valued at or more than $5 million.      defined in Clause 2.65 of IDA's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
Commodities for private sector contracts  Based on established commercial practices.&#13;
valued at less than $5 million.&#13;
Goods for private sector contracts valued at or   Simplified ICB procedures under Clauses 2.63&#13;
more than $3 million.                   and 2.64 of IDA's Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
Goods for private sector contracts valued at    Based on established commercial practices.&#13;
less than $3 million.&#13;
Note: Imports valued at less than $20,000 would not be eligible for financing&#13;
19.   There is no Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) currently available&#13;
for the country. However, a draft CPAR was prepared in October 2001 and is pending&#13;
finalization. The private sector is free to import almost any material into the country, and&#13;
goods imports in the year 2000 exceeded US$ 1.8 billion. Commercial practices of&#13;
private sector firms are based on open competition and are generally consistent with a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
competitive market place. Most procurement decisions by private sector firms are based&#13;
on comparison of at least three offers or price quotations. Typically, firms obtain&#13;
multiple quotations from traditional suppliers of the items and base their purchase&#13;
decisions on the principle of best value for money. Oil imports by the biggest importer in&#13;
FYR Macedonia are based on the spot oil price in the world market. Because of this&#13;
judgment that private sector importing is generally profit-oriented and, therefore,&#13;
efficient, it is determined that current commercial practices would be acceptable without&#13;
any additional stipulation. The thresholds for IDA prior review are based on typical&#13;
contracts of medium and large companies, which were generally more than US$ 3&#13;
million, while oil import contracts were generally more than US$ 5 million.&#13;
20.   The National Bank, which in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance is the&#13;
executing agency for the proposed Project, has prior experience in coordination of&#13;
disbursements against imports and is capable of ensuring compliance with the agreed&#13;
procurement arrangements.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
21.   The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of the&#13;
delivered cost of imports by the private sector, excluding import duties and taxes, subject&#13;
to the agreed positive list. Disbursements in respect of expenditures under contracts for&#13;
goods for the private sector costing less than US$ 3 million equivalent and under&#13;
contracts for commonly traded commodities for the private sector costing less than US$ 5&#13;
million would be made against Statements of Expenditure, for which supporting&#13;
documentation would be retained by the National Bank and made available for review by&#13;
IDA financial management and procurement specialists and project auditors. General&#13;
withdrawal procedures will be used. The project would be implemented over a six-month&#13;
period and with completion scheduled for June 30, 2002, although it is expected that the&#13;
Credit will be mostly disbursed in the first two months after effectiveness. The Closing&#13;
Date for this credit would be December 31, 2002.&#13;
22.   Retroactive Financing.  Retroactive financing in the amount of SDR 2.32&#13;
million (US$ 3.0 million equivalent), 20 percent of the credit amount, would be provided&#13;
to finance expenditures incurred up to four months before credit signing.&#13;
Financial Management and Monitoring&#13;
23.   Overall Status. There is already a project financial management system in place&#13;
at the Department of Foreign Relations of the National Bank which would satisfy the&#13;
Association's financial management requirements for the project as required under&#13;
OP/BP 10.02. However, since the Credit is expected to entail only a limited number of&#13;
disbursements and to be fully disbursed in about two months from effectiveness, records&#13;
and accounts could be maintained without an elaborate accounting system. Even so, a&#13;
minimum requirement must be that arrangements are made to ensure that the customs&#13;
certificates needed to support Association disbursements under the Credit are properly&#13;
recorded and maintained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
24.   Monthly Financial Reporting. Since the project is to be disbursed over a short&#13;
period of time, it has been agreed that monthly reports will be submitted to IDA within&#13;
15 days after the end of each calendar month, including a summary list of goods imported&#13;
supported by customs certificates used for withdrawals and a statement of the Deposit&#13;
Account for the Credit.&#13;
25.   End of Project Reporting. Project Financial Statements covering the entire&#13;
project period are to be prepared in the same format as for monthly reports. They will be&#13;
submitted to IDA together with the Audit Report no later than four months after the last&#13;
disbursement.&#13;
26.   Audit Arrangements. The Ministry of Finance has selected independent private&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA for a special audit upon completion of the Project. It has been&#13;
agreed that the terms of reference for the audit will include the following tasks:&#13;
(a) assessment of adequacy and reliability of procedures used to prepare customs&#13;
certificates or similar certificates;&#13;
(b) examination of customs certificates on which the Credit disbursements have&#13;
been made;&#13;
(c) assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems to&#13;
monitor expenditures and other financial transactions;&#13;
(d) verification that expenditures submitted to the Association are eligible for&#13;
IDA financing (including verification of eligibility of country of origin of the&#13;
goods financed and verification that the goods are on the positive list), and&#13;
identification of any ineligible expenditures; and&#13;
(e) issuance of an opinion as to the degree of compliance with IDA's procedures&#13;
for flow of funds and especially that conversions of Credit proceeds into local&#13;
currency have been carried out in a proper and transparent manner.&#13;
E. ACTION PLAN&#13;
27.   During negotiations, the Government delegation and Association representatives&#13;
reached speedy agreement on the remaining details of financial management, reports, and&#13;
auditing, of procurement thresholds, and disbursement procedures to be followed. A set&#13;
of performance monitoring indicators was agreed during negotiations. These indicators&#13;
include the behavior of economic production levels and the response of resource&#13;
mobilization from the donor community. The indicators were selected to allow the&#13;
Association to track the impact of the Project without being unduly burdensome to the&#13;
Government.&#13;

            Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -
            Emergency Economic Recovery Credit Project

        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Economic Recovery Credit
            Project for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will
            help restore economic activity disrupted by the recent
            emergency through enhanced access by the private sector to
            critical imports. The Credit supports the restoration of
            assets and production levels immediately after the civil
            disturbances that seriously disrupted the Borrower's
            economy during 2001 by providing immediate financing for a
            positive list of imports identified as necessary to an
            effective recovery program while supporting macroeconomic
            objectives by providing financing for the budget. It also
            encourages resource mobilization from the donor community as
            a whole by setting an example of rapid assistance. While
            this type of operation does not include conditionality
            linked to macroeconomic policies, IDA/Bank monitoring of
            economic developments and close collaboration with the IMF
            will help ensure adequate macroeconomic and fiscal diligence
            on the part of the Government.
