&#13;
1.      On September 16, 2004 the Board o f Executive Directors approved the Second&#13;
Structural Adjustment Credit for Serbia and Montenegro (Republic o f Montenegro) (SAC 2,&#13;
IDA Credit No. 3983-YF) in the amount of SDR 12.3 million (US$ 18 million equivalent).&#13;
The Credit, which was declared effective on January 27, 2005, has two equal tranches o f&#13;
SDR 6.15 million (US$9 million equivalent). The first tranche was disbursedon December&#13;
27, 2004. All conditions for the release o f the second tranche have been met. The closing&#13;
date for the Credit is September 30,2006.&#13;
&#13;
2.      This memorandum summarizes the progress in the execution o f the reform program&#13;
andthe actions taken by the Government of the Republic of Montenegro to meetthe specific&#13;
conditions for the release o f the second tranche. The memorandum concludes that the&#13;
conditions for the release o f the second tranche have been met and satisfactory progress has&#13;
beenmade inthe policy areas mentioned inthe Letter o f Development Policy (LDP). Inlight&#13;
of this satisfactory performance, the Government o f the Republic o f Montenegro i s being&#13;
informed that the secondtranche o fthe Credit i s being released for disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
                                     I. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
3.      On May 21, 2006, Montenegro held a national referendum in which 55.5 percent o f&#13;
the registered voters voted for independence. The referendumpaved the way for Montenegro&#13;
as a new independentstate, ending the loose federation with the Republic o f Serbia that had&#13;
been inplace since 2002. The Republic of Montenegro officially declared its independence&#13;
on June 3,2006.&#13;
&#13;
4.      On July 17, 2006, the Government o f Montenegro submitted its application for&#13;
membership in IBRD, IDA, IFC, and MIGA. On July 19, 2006, the Bank country&#13;
management sought approval o f the Executive Directors for continued Bank Group activities&#13;
in Montenegro, pending the finalization of Montenegro's membership.               The Board&#13;
subsequently granted approval for the continuation o f Bank Group activities inMontenegro&#13;
during the interimperiod.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The Second Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC 2) has provided financial support to&#13;
the Government of the Republic of Montenegro's stabilization program, and helped&#13;
implementcritical structural reforms insupport oftransition, fiscal consolidation and growth.&#13;
The operation intended to achieve these objectives through specific reforms in (i)the&#13;
financial sector; (ii) energy sector; (iii) pension and health sectors; and, (iv) public&#13;
                      the                     the&#13;
administration.&#13;
&#13;
                         11.     RECENT   ECONOMICPERFORMANCE&#13;
&#13;
6.      The Republic of Montenegro inherited a legacy of four decades o f inefficient&#13;
economic management and institutional policies that stifled private sector-led growth. For&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                         2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
nearly a decade following the breakup o f the former Socialist Federal Republic o f&#13;
Yugoslavia, regional conflicts and international isolation crippled the economy and delayed&#13;
the start of the transitionto a market economy. Since 1997, however, Montenegro, with the&#13;
support o f the international community,'                   has been engaged in a long series o f&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization, and market-oriented structural reforms.&#13;
&#13;
7.       With the implementation of currency and fiscal policy reforms, Montenegro has&#13;
succeeded to rein in inflation and bring about considerable macroeconomic stability. In&#13;
parallel, it also implemented a number o f structural reforms, including price and trade&#13;
liberalization, privatization, public administration reform, financial sector reform, pension&#13;
reform, and labor market and business environment reforms, which have supported modest&#13;
economic growth and transition. The government has recently updated its Economic Reform&#13;
Program for 2005-2007 to guide the implementation o f the remaining structural reforms.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Recent macroeconomic developments have been favorable. Real economic&#13;
growth, although still sluggish, has steadily improved (from 2.3 percent in 2003 to 3.7&#13;
percent in2004 to an estimated 4 percent in2005). Inflation was reduced from 25 percent at&#13;
the end of 2000 to about 2.4 percent at the end of 2005, mainly due to the adoption of the&#13;
euro as sole legal tender ("euroization").             I t s principal human welfare indicators such as&#13;
poverty, life expectancy, and adult literacy have remained moderate and stable.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Fiscal developments have been broadly favorable. Montenegro's consolidated&#13;
government budget deficit was reduced from about 5 percent of republican GDP in 2002 to&#13;
about 2 percent in 2005. The fiscal consolidation i s approximately equally split between&#13;
expenditure reducing and revenue increasing measures. The introduction of VAT in 2003&#13;
has supported a relatively high revenue-to-GDP ratio while reductions in transfers and&#13;
interest payments helpedlower public expenditures. Going forward, further cuts inthe wage&#13;
bill, transfers to households and public enterprises, and interest payments are needed to&#13;
reduce the remaining deficit and to create a fiscal room for increased public investment.&#13;
&#13;
10.      The recorded current account deficit (before grants) has declinedfrom about 20&#13;
percent of GDP in 2002 to 11 percent in 2005 but it remains largeS2Montenegro's&#13;
merchandise exports are not diversified and remain largely dominated by the export o f&#13;
aluminum, which accounts for almost 50 percent o f merchandise exports. Imports remain&#13;
high at around 56 percent o f GDP in 2005. While it is not unusual for transition countries&#13;
such as Montenegro to run a high current account deficit to facilitate capital replacement,&#13;
there i s a need for Montenegro to adjust to a lower current account deficit especially inview&#13;
o f a continuing shift from grants to non-concessional loan financing. With regard to debt,&#13;
Montenegro's total public debt remains moderate at about 42 percent o f GDP, with foreign&#13;
debt accounting for about 33 percent of GDP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
' Main  donors in Montenegro include the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the&#13;
European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR), World Bank, and the United Nations Development Program&#13;
(UNDP).&#13;
 Montenegro's Balance of Paymentsdata are unreliable. For 2002-04, imports are probably overestimated since&#13;
a significant proportion is actually "exported" onwards to Serbia. Also some o f the financing items in the&#13;
capital account, such as the FDI data, may not be reliable.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.     Looking ahead, Montenegro faces the challenge of increasing growth within the&#13;
framework of "euroization". Sluggish growth and relatively highunemployment appear to&#13;
be symptomatic of inadequate structural flexibility in the economy, including in labor&#13;
market, business environment, and infrastructure.     Further structural reforms focused on&#13;
these areas will therefore be crucial to speeding up growth and reducing unemployment,&#13;
while further enhancing macroeconomic stability through a tighter and sustainable fiscal&#13;
policy. The Bank programs continue to support these goals.&#13;
&#13;
               111.    PROGRESS INIMPLEMENTING THE REFORMPROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
12.     In 2003, the Government of the Republic of Montenegro formally adopted its&#13;
Economic Reform Agenda (ERA) covering the period 2003-2007, and a Poverty Reduction&#13;
Strategy (PRSP) aimed at reducing poverty. The ERA established a broad strategic vision o f&#13;
a liberalized, market-based economy, on which subsequent economic reforms have been&#13;
based. The ERA has recently been updated to guide the economic reform program for the&#13;
period2005-2007.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The Government o fthe Republic of Montenegrohas achieved satisfactory progress in&#13;
carrying out structural reforms under its past and current development lending operations,&#13;
SAC 1and SAC 2. Under SAC 1, the Government implementeda reform program covering&#13;
reforms in(i) public expenditure management; (ii)   pensions; (iii) energy sector; (iv) labor&#13;
                                                                  the&#13;
markets; and (v) the business environment. The enactment o f a law on pension disability&#13;
insurance adjusted key parameters o f the pension system to better align entitlements to&#13;
available resources. The revised labor law significantly increased labor market flexibility.&#13;
The enactment of new enterprise, bankruptcy, and secured transaction laws created a more&#13;
favorable business environment. The enactment of a new energy law provided a basis for the&#13;
development o f a regulatory framework, together with energy industry restructuring and&#13;
liberalization.&#13;
&#13;
14.     SAC 2 built on and consolidated a number o f reforms supported under SAC 1 as well&#13;
as programs supported by other donors. The operation covered four broad policy areas: (i)&#13;
consolidating reforms in the financial sector; (ii)implementing the restructuring o f the&#13;
energy sector; (iii)continuing the implementation o f pension reforms and initiating deeper&#13;
health sector reforms;     and (iv)strengthening the transparency,       accountability, and&#13;
effectiveness o f public administration. The financial sector reforms helped promote growth&#13;
through increased (and increasingly efficient) financial intermediation. Pension, health and&#13;
public administrationreform primarily supported fiscal consolidation. Energy sector reforms&#13;
supported both growth and fiscal consolidation by overcoming episodes o f supply shortfall&#13;
and ensuringthe financial self-sufficiency o f energyutilities.&#13;
&#13;
             IV.    PROGRESS   AGAINSTSECOND TRANCHE          RELEASE CRITERIA&#13;
&#13;
15.     The Government has maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework as&#13;
agreed with the Bank and the IMF. The IMF had a single program for Serbia and&#13;
Montenegro, but program performance has been separately monitored for each republic, the&#13;
Republic o f Serbia and the Republic o f Montenegro. The IMF successfully concluded the&#13;
Sixth and final review o f the extended three year facility (2002-2006) for Serbia and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Montenegro inFebruary 2006. The most recent IMF mission to the Republic o f Montenegro&#13;
 inJune 2006 concluded that the macroeconomic program is broadly on track.3 As outlined&#13;
 above, the macroeconomic environment o f Montenegro remains stable, with declining fiscal&#13;
 deficits, low and stable inflation (2-3 percent), and steadily improving growth.&#13;
&#13;
  16.     Progress against specific secondtranche release criteria as set out inSchedule 2 o f the&#13;
 Development Credit Agreement i s described below:&#13;
&#13;
          Condition 1. A newly established Government o f Montenegro agency or department&#13;
          of the Ministry o f Finance has contracted out the management and disposition of, or&#13;
          otherwise sold by public auction, the unimpaired assets transferred from the Central&#13;
          Bank o f Montenegro to the Government o f Montenegro, all under terms and&#13;
          conditions and inaccordance withprocedures satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
  17.     This condition has been met. An asset management unit was established at the&#13;
 Montenegrin Ministry of Finance (MOF) in2004 inaccordance with procedures satisfactory&#13;
 to the Association.     Since 2004, the unit has recovered about euros 8 million (euros 4.1&#13;
 million in 2004, 2 million in2005, and 2 million in 2006) or about % percent o f GDP. The&#13;
 unit is working to ensure further asset recovery through organizing auctions of loans and&#13;
 equities, and real estate properties.&#13;
&#13;
          Condition 2.       Following the implementation by Podgoricka Banka o f pre-&#13;
          privatization measures and a restructuring o f the Podgoricka Banka Board o f&#13;
          Directors, all shares in Podgoricka Banka directly owned by the Government o f&#13;
          Montenegro have been offered for cash sale through an international tender, in&#13;
          accordance with best international practices, and under terms and conditions and in&#13;
          accordancewithprocedures satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
  18.     This condition has been met. Preparation for the sale of Podgoricka Banka (PB)&#13;
 started in September 2004. Following a competitive selection procedure, an international&#13;
privatization advisor was engaged by end-January 2005 to assist the authorities putting upthe&#13;
bank for sale. Due diligence was completed by the end o f the first quarter of 2005, reflecting&#13;
the audit results for 2004. The bank was offered for sale through international tender on June&#13;
24, 2005. The tender closed by September 30, 2005, after which France's Societe Generale&#13;
bought the majority share inPodgoricka Banka for euros 14.2 million.&#13;
&#13;
          Condition 3. The Financial Intelligence Unit has applied for membership in the&#13;
          Egmont group and the Government o f Montenegro has submitted to the Association&#13;
          satisfactory evidence that the FIUhas begun to perform functions incompliance with&#13;
          the Egmont group definition o f a Financial Intelligence Unit and in a manner&#13;
          satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
  19.     This condition has been met. An anti-money laundering law was adopted in2004.&#13;
The Montenegrin Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) submitted application for membership to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
~~       ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Montenegro applied for membership in the IMF in July 2006, and membership decisions are under&#13;
consideration, A successiveIMFprogram couldbe defined after membership decisionsare made.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Egmont Group in February 2005. The application was considered during the Egmont&#13;
Group's June 2005 annual meeting, and Montenegro became the member o f the Egmont&#13;
Group in Washington on June 29, 2005. In addition, the Montenegrin Government made&#13;
amendments to the anti-money laundering law to include prevention o f financing o f terrorist&#13;
activities, which were subsequently endorsed by the Montenegrin Parliament. Membership&#13;
intheEgmont Group includes exchange ofconfidentialinformationonmoney laundering.&#13;
&#13;
         Condition4. A restructuring planfor the Electric Power Company ofMontenegro&#13;
         (EPCG) has been implemented, ina manner satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
20.      This condition has been met. The decision to functionally unbundle EPCG was&#13;
made by the EPCG Board in December 2004. Since then, the functional unbundling of&#13;
EPCG's generation, transmission, distribution and supply businesses have moved forward.&#13;
The different businesses have been established as cost centers, and a decentralized&#13;
management structure has beenput inplace. Currently, EPCG i s working on the drafting of&#13;
unit level business plans, rationalizing functions within cost centers, and upgrading&#13;
employees' skills. A system o f transfer pricing i s being put in place, which will facilitate&#13;
accounting separation from the year 2007 onwards. Going forward, it i s intended that the&#13;
EPCG businesses will be legally separated (Le., established as subsidiaries within a holding&#13;
company structure) by 2007 at the latest.&#13;
&#13;
         Condition5. The Podgorica Aluminum Plant (KAP) and EPCGhave signed a multi-&#13;
         year power purchase agreement which provides for a phased tariff increase in the&#13;
         mediumterm, andwhich is satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
21.      This condition has been met. The Government of the Republic of Montenegro and&#13;
IDA agreed atarget power purchaseprice, which was defined inthe PrivatizationStrategy of&#13;
KAP. Potential bidders for KAP were advised to use the target price as a minimum.Requests&#13;
for expressions o f interest inKAP were issued in2004. Negotiations betweenthe prospective&#13;
owner o f KAP and the Government o f Montenegro were completed in December 2005. In&#13;
September 2006, KAP and EPCG signed a multi-year Power Purchase Agreement covering&#13;
2006-2010. According to this Agreement, KAP pays 20.44 /MWh for a maximum o f&#13;
1,204,762 MWh power supplied (which represents about 2/3 o f the power needs o f KAP) in&#13;
2006. However, from 2007 onwards power price will be determined by the LME formula4&#13;
that depends on international prices and the DollarEuro exchange rate. In2009 and 2010, the&#13;
quantity o f electricity which EPCG delivers to KAP will be reduced to 903,570 MWh and&#13;
601,555 MWh, respectively. The LME formula pricing will also be adjusted for the changes&#13;
inthe price index ofpower energy on Leipzig Stock Exchange duringJanuary 2006-January&#13;
2009, thereby allowing for a phasedelectricity tariff increase over the mediumterm.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4The formula is as follows: PE= PC + ((LME-1550)*0.024)(middle exchange rate USD), where PC= USD&#13;
24.39 per M W h converted into euros at the middle exchange rate from the quotation list o f the European&#13;
Central Bank on the invoice day. Ifthe calculation is lower than EUR 20.44, the floor price of EUR20.44 shall&#13;
be applied; LME=average primary aluminum price at the London Metal Exchange inthe month for which the&#13;
invoice is submitted for supplied power; and the middle exchange rate is based on the quotation list o f the&#13;
European Central Bank on the invoice day.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Condition 6. The Republic of Montenegro has enacted a law on consolidated&#13;
         reporting and control o f social security contributions, personal income tax and surtax,&#13;
         satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
22.      This condition has been met. The law on consolidated reporting and control o f&#13;
social security contributions, personal income tax and surtax was approved by the&#13;
Government, and subsequently enacted by the Montenegrin Parliament in May 2005. The&#13;
law harmonizes provisions on social security contribution control and collection, currently&#13;
scattered inseveral pieces o f legislation. The implementation o f the law i s scheduledto start&#13;
in2006.&#13;
&#13;
         Condition 7. The Republic of Montenegro has enacted a law on medicinal products,&#13;
         satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
23.      This conditionhas beenmet. The Law on MedicinalProducts andMedical Devices&#13;
was enacted on December 14, 2004.             The Law brings Montenegro's pharmaceutical&#13;
regulation into line with international practice and EU requirements. Prior to its enactment,&#13;
three amendments were presentedto the Law with respect to the use o f languages o f ethnic&#13;
minorities for medicines labeling.&#13;
&#13;
         Condition 8. The Government of Montenegro has adopted an implementation plan&#13;
         related to the Law on Medicinal Products, Law on State Administration, Public&#13;
         Procurement Law, Health Care Law, and Health Insurance Law, and other related&#13;
         laws, covering changes required in the organization and operation o f the Ministry of&#13;
         Health, Montefarm, and the Medicines Agency within the Ministry o f Health,&#13;
         satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
24.      This condition has been met. The Ministryof Health (MOH) took a leading role in&#13;
drafting the Implementation Plan. All laws were examined, and most recent reforms inthe&#13;
health sector involving functional or organizational changes in the MOH, Montefarm (the&#13;
government pharmaceutical agency) and the Medicines Agency were consolidated into the&#13;
Implementation Plan. A draft Implementation Plan, which consisted o f a schedule for&#13;
developing by-laws and regulations as well as obtaining facilities, staff, and budget for the&#13;
proposed new Medicines Agency, was prepared by the Ministry o f Health in April 2005.&#13;
The Parliament of Montenegro subsequently adopted the Plan on October 5,2005. The plan&#13;
i s satisfactory to IDA, and its implementationwill be facilitated by the IDA-supportedHealth&#13;
Project inMontenegro.&#13;
&#13;
         Condition 9. The Republic of Montenegro has adopted the Budget Law for 2005&#13;
         which ensures adequate budgetary transfers to the health and pension systems, and&#13;
         has adopted an indicative three year fiscal framework, all satisfactory to the&#13;
         Association.&#13;
&#13;
25.      This condition hasbeenmet. In2004, state budget transfers to the HealthInsurance&#13;
Fund (HIF) and the Pensions Fund (PIO) amounted to euros 1.72 million and euros 37.72&#13;
million, respectively. These transfers were inadequate. In2005, with the support o f SAC 2,&#13;
the Budget Law planned to transfer to the Health Insurance Fund(HIF) and Pensions Fund&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(PIO) euros 7.23 million, and euros 61 million respectively-a significant increase relative to&#13;
2004. The execution o f the 2005 Budget has resulted in the actual transfer o f euros 6.5&#13;
million to the HIF and euros 44.4 million to the Pensions Fund. These were adequate&#13;
budgetary allocations.&#13;
&#13;
        Condition 10. A new salary system for civil service has been introduced with the&#13;
        2005 Republic o f Montenegro Budget, which has increased the base pay to real pay&#13;
        ratio to at least 80 percent and provides for an effective de-compression o f salaries in&#13;
        the core civil service, andis satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
26.     This condition has been met. The implementation of the new Law on Salaries o f&#13;
Civil Servants and Employees was introduced with the 2005 Republican budget.                The&#13;
implementation o f the Law has been linked to the implementation o f the Law on Civil&#13;
Servants and Employees, which required that new ranking structure be introduced in&#13;
Ministries and agencies (called "systematization").     Most Ministries and agencies have had&#13;
their new Systematization Acts adopted and approved by the Government.                With the&#13;
exception o f the Ministry o f Interior, Ministryo f Economy, and Ministry o f Culture, all other&#13;
ministries and agencies have implemented the new Law on Salaries.             The Ministry o f&#13;
Interior, in accordance with the Law on Civil Servants and Employees, i s creating a special&#13;
civil service ranking structure at present, which upon completion would be followed by&#13;
implementationo f the new Law on Salaries, as prescribed by the Article 9, paragraph 2 o f the&#13;
Law on Salaries. The Government remains committed to full implementation o f the new&#13;
Salary Law in all ministries and agencies with the 2006 budget. The 2005 budget has also&#13;
satisfactorily increasedthe base pay to real pay ratio to 90 percent, beyondthe program target&#13;
of 80 percent.&#13;
&#13;
        Condition 11. The Republic of Montenegro Civil Service Agency (CSA) has been&#13;
        established and staffed, competencies o f the CSA in relation to other ministries and&#13;
        agencies o f the Government of Montenegro have been clearly defined and a human&#13;
        resources management system has become operational, all o f the above actions being&#13;
        satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
27.     This condition has been met. The Government created a Civil Service Agency&#13;
(CSA) in September 2004 to strengthen the reform management and create specialized&#13;
expertise. The CSA, reporting to the Ministry o f Justice, i s responsible for human resource&#13;
management and development. After initial difficulties getting started, the CSA i s now&#13;
