THE "GRADUATION" ISSUE IN TRADE POLICY TOWARD LDCs&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1979&#13;
This paper, completed in February 1979, starts from the premise&#13;
that developed and developing countries have a common interest in maintain-&#13;
ing a reasonably open international trading system based on agreed rules&#13;
and constraints on national behaviour. Under the present system developing&#13;
countries are accorded certain forms of preferential treatment, but it&#13;
becomes increasingly difficult to justify such treatment as a country's&#13;
development progresses, and there is a risk of the system being weakened&#13;
unless arrangements are devised for "graduating" selected countries into&#13;
the developed group. The paper explores the issues at stake for the LDCs&#13;
and suggests how the graduation problem might be handled in the GATT.&#13;

THE "GRADUATION" ISSUE IN TRADE POLICY&#13;
TOWARD LDCs&#13;
Introduction&#13;
In the context of this paper 'graduation' refers to the phasing&#13;
out and ultimate elimination for the more economically advanced LDCs of the&#13;
differential treatment in trade that they now receive and the progressive&#13;
alignment of their own trade policies with the generally applicable rules&#13;
of the international trading system.&#13;
Best known of the types of differential treatment now enjoyed by&#13;
developing countries are the broad right to infant-industry protection and&#13;
the preferential access they receive in the markets of developed countries.&#13;
In addition, LDCs are not bound by the prohibition of subsidies on exports&#13;
of non-primary products, are relieved of the obligation to offer reciprocal&#13;
concessions for negotiated tariff reductions, and are de facto virtually&#13;
free from the obligation to refrain from imposing quantitative restrictions&#13;
for protective purposes. Most developing countries, including some of the&#13;
most economically advanced LDCs, are also free to impose exchange controls&#13;
on current transactions and to engage in discriminatory currency arrangements&#13;
without the permission of the IMF.&#13;
The whole question of the treatment of LDCs in trade matters became&#13;
one of the most difficult issues in the multilateral trade negotiations that&#13;
have just concluded. A major effort was made in the "Tokyo Round" not only&#13;
to reduce tariffs, but to negotiate a series of codes that would strengthen&#13;
and rationalize the international rules and their administration in a number&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
of key non-tariff areas, including such sensitive subjects as subsidies and&#13;
safeguards against market disruption. In these negotiations the U.S. took the&#13;
lead in linking its support for special treatment for LDCs to the inclusion of&#13;
provisions for phasing out such treatment for the more advanced LDCs as&#13;
warranted by their progress in development.&#13;
This linkage was confirmed by the major trading nations in the&#13;
framework of understanding on the principal elements of the Tokyo Round&#13;
announced in Geneva on July 13, 1978. Of special importance will be "the&#13;
provision of an enabling clause providing a basis for special and differential&#13;
treatment in favor of developing countries--particularly the least developed&#13;
countries--as well as for their increasing acceptance of responsibilities&#13;
under the trading system as their development proceeds."&#13;
The Case for Graduation&#13;
The general case for graduation is that special and differential&#13;
treatment, if applied indiscriminately to all LDCs, regardless of their state&#13;
of development and international competitiveness, will have adverse effects on&#13;
both developed and developing countries. By creating a permanent two-tier&#13;
trading system, it would undermine the current efforts to strengthen inter-&#13;
national discipline over national trade policies and to foster the kind of&#13;
open markets in which all countries, and especially those in the developing&#13;
world, have a major stake.&#13;
The least developed countries have a particular interest in the&#13;
graduation issue. In their early efforts to industrialize, the small size of&#13;
ii,i-r domestic markets often precludes a minimum efficient scale of operation.&#13;
They must therefore find export markets. While their main markets will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
continue to be in the industrial countries, the natural export markets for&#13;
some of their simple manufactured products may lie not in the advanced&#13;
industrial world but in the middle-income countries among the LDCs. 1/&#13;
Unless the latter avoid restrictive import practices and progressively assume&#13;
their full GATT obligations, the growth and industrialization efforts of&#13;
the poorer countries will be frustrated.&#13;
Graduation would also afford the least developed countries increased&#13;
opportunities to export to developed countries. Their competitiveness in&#13;
developed country markets would be enhanced by the phasing out of export&#13;
subsidies by the middle-income countries as well as by the gradual removal of&#13;
the latter from the preferential tariff quotas extended to them under some&#13;
general preferential schemes such as that of the European Community.&#13;
Middle-income LDCs would also benefit from the increased opportunities&#13;
for intra-LDC trade resulting from graduation. In addition, some countries&#13;
1/   For two reasons, however, one would not expect to find strong support in&#13;
existing trade data for the potential of LDC markets for the exports of&#13;
least developed countries. The first is related precisely to one of the&#13;
rationales for graduation--namely, the high degree of protection of LDC&#13;
markets through such measures as import quotas and exchange controls in&#13;
addition to steep effective tariffs. The second reason may not be unrelated&#13;
to the first. It is "the absence of a clearly formulated foreign trade&#13;
strategy" in the least developed countries geared to exploiting potential&#13;
export opportunities. "Targets for the growth in exports and imports,&#13;
when stated, are rather simplistic extrapolations of recent performance,&#13;
adjusted for random occurrences." (UNCTAD, "Exploratory Mission on&#13;
Foreign Trade Policy and Planning in the Least Developed Countries:&#13;
Terminal Report", TD/B/AC.17/9, June 2, 1978). In order to realize&#13;
the potentiality of LDC markets for the least developed countries,&#13;
therefore, changes are needed in both the conditions of access to those&#13;
markets and the production and foreign trade policies of the least&#13;
developed countries themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
in this category would find that the existence of an internationally&#13;
established system of graduation would facilitate a policy of trade&#13;
liberalization they wish to adopt in their own interest. Many middle-&#13;
income countries have reached a point where they are highly competitive&#13;
in a wide range of manufactured products0 Economic rationality would&#13;
dictate a gradual phase-out of import restrictions and export subsidies which&#13;
impose unnecessary costs on their economies. A major obstacle, however, is&#13;
the vested interest in the existing foreign trade regime of domestic economic&#13;
groups that wield effective political power. A system of graduation would&#13;
provide the cover of international obligations that could be invoked by LDC&#13;
governments in countering the influence of such groups0&#13;
To the extent that graduation results in a liberalization of the&#13;
trading regimes of LDCs whose manufactured exports have been growing rapidly,&#13;
it would facilitate resistance to mounting protectionist pressures in the&#13;
industrial countries0 Such pressures to restrict competition from "low-wage&#13;
countries" are reinforced when highly successful LDC exporting countries&#13;
persist in subsidizing their exports and limiting access to their own markets&#13;
in ways that would be proscribed if they adhered to the rules applicable&#13;
generally to the nations of the industrial world0&#13;
Origin and Rationale for Special and Differential Treatment&#13;
The demand for special trade treatment for LDCs began in the 1950s&#13;
as part of the more general drive for a radical change in the allegedly&#13;
inequitable economic structures imposed on the LDCs in the course of the&#13;
reconstruction of a liberal world economic order at the end of World War 1I.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Insofar as trade was concerned, the LDCs found two aspects of the&#13;
then existing economic order ideologically objectionable. One was the&#13;
injustice of "equal treatment of unequals" as implied by the GATT most-&#13;
favored-nation principle and the rule of reciprocity in trade negotiations.&#13;
Although special dispensation for developing countries to protect new&#13;
industries was included in GATT from the beginning and strengthened in 1955,&#13;
this provision was regarded as a mere exception to the main body of rules&#13;
which were based on the principle of equal treatment of all countries.&#13;
The second ideological objection was directed to the liberal,&#13;
orientation of the GATT and IMF rules which were taken to imply a non-&#13;
interventionist role for government in international trade and payments&#13;
except for carefully circumscribed conditions. Laissez-faire ran counter&#13;
to the prevailing LDC view that trade should not simply accommodate passively&#13;
to the existing world distribution of resources, but should become an "engine&#13;
of development" through active efforts on the part of governments to use&#13;
trade policy as a means of bringing about a redistribution of world resources&#13;
in favor of the developing countries.&#13;
Apart from these broad ideological predilections, special trade&#13;
treatment for LDCs can be justified on more specific economic grounds. The&#13;
strongest rationale is the infant-industry justification based primarily on&#13;
external economies and increasing returns to scale realized as a result of&#13;
temporary protection of the home market. This argument has been used not&#13;
only to justify the imposition of new protective measures, but also as the&#13;
rationale for not reducing existing tariffs, nor even binding them against&#13;
future increase as reciprocity for concessions received in trade negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
by extension, Li.. infant iriustr; argument can also be used to&#13;
justify preterential treatmwent in foreign marke-s. In this case the new&#13;
industry may be regarded as an infant exporter that neede a period of&#13;
protection in foreign markets from third-country competitors who already&#13;
enjoy established positions in those markets. An ancillary argument for&#13;
trade preferences for LDCs is that they constitute a form of economic aid&#13;
to the extent that the LDCs can appropriate part of the difference between&#13;
the protected price in the preference-giving country and the world market&#13;
price, a difference that would otherwise accrue to the foreign treasury.&#13;
Special and differential treatment has also been de facto accorded&#13;
to LDCs to permit their widespread use of quantitative import restrictions.&#13;
Outside of agriculture, quantitative restrictions are permitted by GATT&#13;
only in defense of the balance of payments. This general exception, dating&#13;
from the beginning of GATT in 1948, is widely recognized as obsolete for&#13;
countries on flexible exchange rate regimes. But even for those countries,&#13;
including many LDCs, whose currencies are in one way or another pegged, micro-&#13;
measures such as quantitative import restrictions on particular products are&#13;
a questionable response to the macro problem of a deteriorating payments&#13;
situation. Despite the legalities, therefore, no developed country has&#13;
resorted to the balance-of-payments exception to justify the imposition of&#13;
import quotas on particular products since the early sixties, well before&#13;
the general move to flexible rates. Such quotas have been used by developed&#13;
countries, however, as safeguard measures in cases of alleged market disruption.&#13;
Nevertheless, LDCs continue freely to resort to quantitative import&#13;
restrictions with protective effects, invoking a balance-of-payments justifi-&#13;
cation whenever pressed to defend such measures. As applied to developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
countries, the GATT balance-of-payments exception is drawn in especially&#13;
broad terms, permitting them "to apply quantitative restrictions for&#13;
balance-of-payments purposes in a manner which takes full account or the&#13;
continued high level of demand for imports likely to be generated by their&#13;
program of economic development" (Article XVIII, 2).&#13;
Finally, developing countries are subject to differential treat-&#13;
ment with respect to export subsidies. Unlike most of the developed countries,&#13;
they have not subscribed to the outright ban on export subsidies for non-&#13;
primary products (Article XVI, 4). Importing countries are free to offset&#13;
export subsidies, however, by imposing countervailing duties (Article VI)&#13;
when material injury is caused to an established domestic industry. Under&#13;
a grandfather clause, the right of the U.S. to countervail is not subject to&#13;
the injury test, but in practice the U.S. has until recently only sparingly&#13;
imposed such offsetting levies on subsidized exports from developing countries.&#13;
Export subsidization for developing countries may be defended on&#13;
two grounds. First, there is the need to correct distortions due to government&#13;
policies resulting in cost disadvantages for exporters--overvalued exchange&#13;
rates, tariffs on imported inputs and the related high cost of domestically-&#13;
produced inputs, and the general bias against exports in favor of producing&#13;
for the home market resulting from policies of protection.    Additionally, an&#13;
argument can be made by analogy to one of the justifications for tariff&#13;
preferences--namely, the disadvantages that LDCs need to overcome in attempting&#13;
to penetrate a foreign market with its established sources of supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8-&#13;
The Two Sides of the Problem&#13;
The foregoing forms of special and differential treatment fit&#13;
broadly into two categories: those that provide special protection for the&#13;
LDCs' domestic market, and those that accord special access to the markets&#13;
of the developed countries. In the former category fall non-reciprocity in&#13;
tariff negotiations, the broadly-drawn right to infant-industry protection,&#13;
and the de facto exception for LDCs from the general prohibition of quantita-&#13;
tive import restrictions. The second category would include the various&#13;
schemes of the developed countries under the general system of preferences&#13;
(GSP) , and any special informal consideration given to LDCs when counter-&#13;
vailing duties are imposed against subsidized exports.&#13;
As their development strategies have changed- the LDCs have over&#13;
the years shifted their emphasis from the first to the second category of&#13;
measures. In the 1950s the trade problem of the developing countries was&#13;
regarded essentially as the need to conserve foreign exchange and build a&#13;
base of domestic industries by sheltering the home markets from imports.&#13;
Hence the demand for greater leeway than granted to other GATT members to&#13;
impose import restrictions to shield the domestic market. As the inevitable&#13;
limits of import substitution began to be experienced, the emphasis shifted&#13;
to strategies of export promotion and demands for special treatment in the&#13;
markets of the developed countries.&#13;
There is also a practical implication to the shift in emphasis.&#13;
The measures required by the LDCs to protect their domestic markets could&#13;
be taken on their own initiative and, given the broad exceptions in GATT,&#13;
were rarely challenged in any formal way. In fact, there developed a tacit&#13;
acceptance by all GATT members that LDCs were essentially not constrained from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
taking whatever measures they wished to protect their domestic markets from&#13;
imports originating not only in developed countries but in other developing&#13;
countries as well. On the other hand, differential access to developed-&#13;
country markets required positive action by the developed countries themselves&#13;
rather than passive acquiescence, and when granted by the latter, was subject&#13;
to explicit terms and conditions.&#13;
Just as special and differential treatment for LDCs has comprehended&#13;
these two aspects, so should the concept of graduation be conceived as a&#13;
dual principle. It should include not only the phasing out of more favorable&#13;
treatment in the markets of developed countries, but also the phasing in of&#13;
LDC compliance with the generally prevailing rules of the international&#13;
trading system based on a balance of rights and responsibilities.&#13;
A further distinction can be made between "special" and "differential"&#13;
treatment. Unlike differential treatment, special treatment can be taken to&#13;
mean favorable treatment applied on a non-favored-nation basis. In includes,&#13;
for example, deeper-than-formula tariff cuts on products of special interest&#13;
to LDCs, or faster staging of concessions on such products. As these "special"&#13;
measures do not create a vested LDC interest in retaining existing trade&#13;
restrictions (in contrast to GSP), they are compatible with the goal of an&#13;
open world economy and need not be considered in the context of the graudation&#13;
issue.&#13;
Graduation in Practice&#13;
If a system of LDC graduation from differential treatment in trade&#13;
is to be considered, what principles should be applied to give effect to the&#13;
system? Perhaps it would be best to start by look at how graduation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
mechanisms in existing intrnational institutions operate and the kinds&#13;
of distinctions thev make among LDCs based on their level of development.&#13;
GATT itself provides little help in this regard. The principle&#13;
of differential treatment for LDC trade is recognized in two places:&#13;
Article XVIII (Governmenta' .Assistance to Economic Development) and Part IV&#13;
(Trade and Development) comprising Articles XXXVI-XXXVIII. Article XVIII&#13;
provides special dispensation to countries "in the early stages of development"&#13;
to use tariffs and quotas uL protect infant industries or to defend the&#13;
balance of payments. But no precise criteria of country eligibility are&#13;
included. Nor have such criteria evolved in case law as the article has&#13;
rarely been formally invoked. The principle of graduation, therefore, is&#13;
at best implicit in Article XVIII.&#13;
Part IV comprises a series of commitments that developed countries&#13;
are to undertake toward LDCs, but without any formal definition of LDCs. The&#13;
only hint of a graduation concept is in Article XXXVII (4) where LDCs agree&#13;
"tto take appropriate action in implementation of the provisions of Part IV&#13;
for the benefit of the trade of other less developed contracting parties"&#13;
insofar as such action is consistent with their individual development,&#13;
financial and trade needs. Here there is at least the notion that&#13;
distinctions should be drawn among LDCs in the sense of more favorable&#13;
treatment for those least developed.&#13;
In addition to these provisions for differential treatment in the&#13;
General Agreement itself, two waivers of the most-favored-nation principle&#13;
were granted in 1971 by the signatories of GATT to permit preferential&#13;
treatment of LDC trade. One waiver was granted to permit LDCs to extend&#13;
preferential trade treatment among each other by signing the Protocol&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Relating to Trade Negotiations among Developing Countries. No provision&#13;
was made, however, for graduation out of the special privileges accorded&#13;
in this Protocol. The other waiver was adopted to permit the industrial&#13;
countries to apply the General System of Preferences (GSP) to the LDCs.&#13;
The GSP arrangements do in practice include principles of graduation.&#13;
Under the GSP waiver ten OECD countries and the European Community&#13;
have instituted regimes of preferences for imports of manufactured products&#13;
from LDCs. While the lists of beneficiaries are not uniform in all the schemes,&#13;
they generally include all countries that declare themselves to be LDCs,&#13;
with a few exceptions based largely on political considerations (e.g. North&#13;
Korea). Individual developing countries as such do not graduate from&#13;
GSP schemes; only certain products or portions of their trade in such products&#13;
become ineligible for preferential treatment when they no longer meet&#13;
certain criteria of competitive need.&#13;
In the case of the US, for example, an LDC loses its GSP preference&#13;
in a particular product for the next year when either of two tests of&#13;
competitive need is met: when that country's exports of the product to the&#13;
US exceed 50 percent of total US imports of the product; or when US imports&#13;
of that country's product exceed a specified dollar ceiling adjusted to&#13;
reflect the growth of the US economy ($33.4 million in 1978).&#13;
Unlike the US system in which an LDC product meeting either of the&#13;
two criteria loses its preferential treatment entirely, the EC scheme is a&#13;
tariff-quota system. Imports receive the benefit of reduced tariffs until&#13;
the product quota has been filled. Individual LDCs are assigned maximum&#13;
country amounts ranging from 15 percent to 50 percent of the product ceiling.&#13;
All exports of a product above the maximum country amounts are subject to&#13;
the regular mfn duty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
The GSP gradua L1on mechanisms have a two-fold purpose. One is&#13;
to safeguard the preference-giver against preferential imports of particular&#13;
products from countries that have presumptively demonstrated their&#13;
international competitiveness in those products. The other purpose is to&#13;
ensure a wide dispersion among LDCs of the benefits from preferential trade&#13;
measures. Under the US scLeme, for example, about 300 products were removed&#13;
in 1977 when exported from particular developing countries because those&#13;
countries had exceeded the ceilings. About 75 percent of the removals were&#13;
accounted for by nine of the most advanced of the developing countries, thus&#13;
providing a differential advantage in those products to less advanced&#13;
developing countries that have a potential or incipient capability for&#13;
exporting similar products.&#13;
The Bretton Woods institutions also apply principles of graduation&#13;
in their operations. In the case of the IMF, a distinction is drawn between&#13;
member countries subject to Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement and&#13;
those subject to Article XIV. Article VIII countries are prohibited, unless&#13;
authorized by the Fund, from imposing restrictions on payments and transfers&#13;
for current international transactions and from engaging in discriminatory&#13;
currency arrangements or multiple currency practices. Countries under&#13;
Article XIV status, on the other hand, may maintain such restrictive or&#13;
discriminatory practices and "adapt them to changing circumstances" if&#13;
the practices were in effect at the time they joined the IMF.&#13;
A member of the Fund is expected to graduate from Article XIV to&#13;
Article VIII status when a reasonable expectation exists that the country's&#13;
balance of payments position will be satisfactory over the medium term.&#13;
Although a country availing itself of the dispensation of Article XIV is&#13;
required to consult regularly with the Fund as to its exchange restrictions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
the decision to relinquish Article VIII rests solely with the individual&#13;
country concerned.&#13;
All industrial member countries of the Fund have acceptpd Article&#13;
VIII status as have also a number of developing countries, especially in&#13;
Latin America. But graduation out of Article XIV status and acceptance of&#13;
the obligations of Article VIII has been resisted by other LDCs despite&#13;
recent records of rapid growth in both their exports and GNP. Among such&#13;
non-graduated LDCs are Brazil, Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, and Turkey.&#13;
These countries therefore retain the right to impose exchange restrictions&#13;
on current transactions without the approval of the Fund.&#13;
The international development banks have long applied a principle&#13;
of differentiation among developing countries in the terms and conditions on&#13;
which they lend. In the case of the World Bank, presumptive per capita income&#13;
guidelines exist for graduation from eligibility for both soft and hard loans.&#13;
The normal upper limit for IDA eligibility is $550 (at 1976 prices), though&#13;
the great bulk of IDA resources has gone to countries below half that amount.&#13;
Such countries as Taiwan, Korea, and Turkey, as well as most countries in&#13;
Latin America, no longer qualify for IDA credits. While the Bank has no&#13;
definite income ceiling for hard loans, there is a presumption against lending&#13;
to countries with per capita incomes above $2000 on the premise that such&#13;
countries are likely to have access at reasonable terms to private capital.&#13;
Singapore, for example, is no longer eligible for IBRD loans.&#13;
As managed by the World Bank, LDC graduation is a phased process.&#13;
Poor countries may initially borrow only at soft IDA terms and then move to&#13;
an intermediate stage of borrowing a blend of soft and hard loans. As&#13;
countries move to higher levels of development, they qualify only for hard&#13;
loans and ultimately do not borrow from the Bank at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
That this surv of present practice reveals is that effect! c&#13;
graduation procedures of some sort exist in only two spheres--inte iuatio1,'&#13;
lending and the general system of preferences (GSP)o   And in the r^4e   I&#13;
GSP, graduation applies strictly to individual products, not t) I,?&#13;
a whole.  Thus, no clear s.andards or effective pressures exist It, th&#13;
entire field of international trade and payments whereby couiiiries   r&#13;
required to assume progressively the full obligations of a rivtite   ra!&#13;
partner. Not surprisingly, in the two spheres mentioned aboje whri, t&#13;
graduation procedures exist, the initiative for and control of th    ,&#13;
graduation rests with parties other than the beneficiaries of the    oiil*1&#13;
the preferences.&#13;
Graduation and the Multilateral Trade Negotiations&#13;
The multilateral trade negotiations (MTN), the results of whicl Iih'a'&#13;
been submitted to governments for approvals, have been a complex exercise&#13;
designed both to liberalize trade and improve the international trading SysT1,&#13;
by strengthening the rules and introducing a greater degree of discipline and&#13;
fairness in their application. With respect to the developing countries,&#13;
the objective has been to take fully into account their special needs for&#13;
differential treatment while nudging them gradually to assume greater&#13;
obligations under the GATT as their economies develop.&#13;
Basically, the negotiation has consisted of these major parts:    a&#13;
traditional exchange of tariff reductions and bindings; a so-called "franiework'&#13;
negotiation intended to strengthen the legal and institutional structure of&#13;
the GATT so as to enable it to enhance its contribution to trade expansion in!&#13;
harnmonious trade relations; and the negotiation of a series of codeq' doility&#13;
mainly with non-tariff measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
The negotiation on tariffs is expected to achieve an average&#13;
reduction of between 30 and 35 percent in the level of duties of the&#13;
participating countries. In addition, some degree of harmonization of rates&#13;
on particular products is in prospect based on a formula guideline under&#13;
which the percentage of reduction increases with the ad valorem level of the&#13;
duty.&#13;
Except for a few LDCs, the role of the developing countries has been&#13;
essentially passive in the tariff negotiations for three reasons. First,&#13;
under the special LDC rule of non-reciprocity in trade negotiations (Article&#13;
XXXVI:8), the developing countries have not felt obliged to participate&#13;
through offers of tariff reductions or bindings on their part. Second, most&#13;
LDCs have felt that, even if they were inclined to participate, their bargaining&#13;
power would be inadequate to affect the course of the negotiations materially.&#13;
A developed country prefers to negotiate a reduction in its tariff on a&#13;
particular product with the principal supplying country for that product&#13;
(although subsequently generalizing the reduction to all other GATT members).&#13;
As most LDCs do not qualify as principal suppliers of dutiable products, their&#13;
scope for negotiating reciprocal reductions is in practice severely limited.&#13;
Finally, some LDCs have sought to limit the scope of the negotiations&#13;
because of the prospective narrowing of margins of preference under GSP that&#13;
would result from tariff reductions by the developed countries on a most-favored-&#13;
nation basis. The latter position is particularly unfortunate because of the&#13;
substantial potential benefits for LDCs of legally-bound, reciprocal tariff&#13;
reductions as compared to the limited benefits they now receive from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
unilateral, temporary,    :d sharply restricted tariff preferences under&#13;
GSP. 1/&#13;
The concept of graduation is central to the effort to address&#13;
these problems in the framework group whose mandate has been to improve and&#13;
make more equitable the f-:lctioning of GATT. The basic idea is to adopt an&#13;
"enabling clause" which would trade off a broad legitimization of special and&#13;
differential treatment for LDCs in return for acceptance by them of the idea&#13;
of graduation in more explicit terms than can now be found in GATT. At&#13;
present, GSP as well as preferential arrangements among LDCs are permitted&#13;
under ad hoc waivers of the GATT mfn clause. Such arrangements, as well as&#13;
differential treatment in the new codes of non-tariff measures, would receive&#13;
general sancltion in the enabling clause. But the latter would also include&#13;
a qualifyinj provision recognizing that preferences and other forms of&#13;
differentia treatment accorded by developed countries should be modified in&#13;
response "tb the development, financial and trade needs of developing&#13;
countries". 2/&#13;
lhe enabling clause would also subject the rule of non-reciprocity&#13;
in trade negotiations and other special dispensations for LDCs to a&#13;
graduatior, provision. It would declare that:&#13;
1/   MFN t.ir;ff reductions apply to all goods in the affected category.&#13;
Under GSP, however, the volume of exports benefitting from margins of&#13;
preference~ is generally subject to limits. Even more important, however,&#13;
is the uncertainty surrounding GSP which acts as a deterrent to potential&#13;
LDC investment in export industries.    GSP margins are not guaranteed and&#13;
may be unilaterally withdrawn at anly time by the country granting them.&#13;
MFN tar iff redtc II onrs, on the other hand, are "bound" and cannot be&#13;
arbitrarily changed.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

"Less developed contracting parties expect that their&#13;
capacity to make contributions or negotiated concessions&#13;
or to take other mutually agreed action under the&#13;
provisions and procedures of the General Agreement wouid&#13;
improve with the progressive development of their economies&#13;
and improvement in their trade situation, and they would&#13;
accordingly expect to participate more fully in the&#13;
framework of rights and obligations under the General&#13;
Agreement through participation in the operation of the&#13;
GATT system". 1/&#13;
Beyond the tariff and "framework" negotiations, the MTN comprises&#13;
a series of codes or agreements in the following fields: customs valuation;&#13;
government procurement; standards and technical regulation; subsidies and&#13;
countervailing duties; and safeguards against "market disruption". Except for&#13;
customs valuation, the intention has been to include in each code differential&#13;
treatment for developing countries along with the principle that the provisions&#13;
of the code would become increasingly applicable to LDCs as their development&#13;
progresses.&#13;
The codes are intended to extend, tighten and rationalize rules of&#13;
trade conduct already in the GATT. As LDCs are now de facto relieved of&#13;
virtually all major GATT obligations, the question arises as to what incentive&#13;
exists for LDCs to sign the codes and thereby specifically acknowledge their&#13;
ultimate obligations to abide by the rules. The general answer is that both&#13;
1/   Ibid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
a carrot and a stick are being applied. The carrot ia the formal&#13;
legitimization of differential treak'ment that would be included in the codes.&#13;
For example, the code on subsidies and countervailing duties would recognize&#13;
that subsidies are an "integral" tool of development policy   a principle not&#13;
now included in the GATT.&#13;
The stick derives from the intention of the principal negotiators&#13;
that the codes would be applied on e'conditional mfn basis, meaning that only&#13;
those countries which sign would benefit from their provisions. Where the&#13;
latter go beyond what is already in the GATT, non-signatories of the code&#13;
would become subject to discrimination. Again taking the example of the&#13;
subsidy code, only signatories would benefit from a U.S. undertaking in the&#13;
code to apply an injury test Edben contervailing against subsidized imports.&#13;
In the absence of the code, the U.S. is now relieved of the GATT obligation to&#13;
apply an injury test under a grandfather clause exempting pre-existing national&#13;
legislation in conflict with the GATT provisions0 In practical terms this&#13;
means that non-signatories of the code might, at the conclusion of the MTN,&#13;
become immediately subject to U.S. countervailing dutieo if they subsidize&#13;
their exports to the U.S. market. The strength of the inducement for LDCs to&#13;
adhere to the subsidy code is thus mainly due to the opecial U.S. circumstances&#13;
surrounding the injury test0 1/ Whether the conditional mfn sanction would be&#13;
equally effective in inducing LDC adherence to @Ko&#142;f.otter codes is open to&#13;
question.&#13;
1/   These circumstances were presuimably an important consideration in the&#13;
recent decision of Brazil to adhere to the code on subsidies and to&#13;
phase out its export subsidies over the next four years. Under the&#13;
new code Brazil would not be subject to U.S. countervailing duties&#13;
on its domestic subsidies (i.e. subsidies tied to domestic production&#13;
rather than exports) unless they can be shown to cause injury to U.S.&#13;
industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Perhaps the most important deficiency of the MTN approach is&#13;
its failure to come to grips with the need to put pressure on the most&#13;
advanced and rapidly growing LDCs to liberalize their own quantitative&#13;
import restrictions and other restrictive import measures such as exchange&#13;
controls and prior deposit requirements. In a draft declaration designed&#13;
to tighten the GATT conditions for the use of trade restrictions for&#13;
balance-of-payments purposes, only a hortatory reference in the preamble&#13;
is made to its applicability to LDCs: "The less developed contracting&#13;
parties must take into account their individual development, financial,&#13;
and trade situation when implementing restrictive import measures taken&#13;
for balance-of-payments purposes". 1/&#13;
At this stage it is difficult to render firm judgments on the&#13;
approach to graduation being taken in the multilateral trade negotiations.&#13;
The quotations cited are from late-stage MTN working documents. In the&#13;
absence of the definitive results and-more precise information as to the&#13;
extent of LDC adherence to the codes, any evaluation must be regarded as&#13;
highly tentative.&#13;
From what has been said, however, the MTN approach to the&#13;
graduation issue would appear to be exceedingly complex and highly&#13;
fragmented. Different formulations of the graduation requirement apply&#13;
to the various areas of trade policy such as reciprocity, government&#13;
procurement, subsidies, and safeguards. And the requirements are by and&#13;
large couched in vague and general terms. Whatever the formal requirements,&#13;
moreover, their effectiveness depends on the procedures for implementing&#13;
them, and these are not spelled out at all.&#13;

Payments Purposes" (from text available as of January 1979).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Next Step on Graduatior&#13;
In order to rationalize the process of graduation on a pragmatic&#13;
basis, a new Committee on Graduation should be established in the GATT.&#13;
Its purpose would be to develop criteria of both a qualitative and&#13;
quantitative nature on th. basis of which individual more developed LDCs&#13;
would be encouraged to forego progressively their special trade privileges&#13;
and increasingly accept the obligation to abide by the rules applying to&#13;
mature international trading partners. Relevant considerations might&#13;
include the capacity of a country to manage its economy efficiently as&#13;
well as such quantitative criteria as per capita income, the ratio of&#13;
manufacturing to total production, the trend in exports of manufactured&#13;
products, the balance of payments on current account, and the country's&#13;
reserve asset position. A graduating country would, of course, retain&#13;
the right to invoke emergency restrictions for balance-of-payments&#13;
purposes and any other safeguard provisions available generally to GATT&#13;
contracting parties.&#13;
It is not envisaged that the new Committee would have powers&#13;
Df decision as to the trading status of individual LDCs. Rather its&#13;
Eunctions would be to define and clarify the criteria for graduation and&#13;
to consult informally with individual advanced LDCs with a view to&#13;
ancouraging and assisting eligible countries to overcome whatever&#13;
)bstacles they perceive to embarking on the process of graduation.&#13;
Two types of assistance could be rendered by the Committee.&#13;
.he first would be to help the candidate develop a plan and schedule&#13;
.or graduation and to enlist the cooperation of other GATT contracting&#13;
'arties, particularly the developed countries, in facilitating a smooth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
transition to the LDC's new status. In this way the staging of the&#13;
progressive phasing out of a country's preferential access to foreign&#13;
markets could be coordinated with the phasing in of the conformity of&#13;
the country's own practices with the GATT rules on such matters as&#13;
import quotas, subsidies and the new code on government procurement.&#13;
With such coordination it would be possible to avoid, for example, the&#13;
possible shock to an LDC industry resulting from the elimination of an&#13;
export subsidy and the simultaneous withdrawal of GSP preferences on the&#13;
products of the same industry. Instead, these two aspects of graduation&#13;
would be separated in time.&#13;
The second type of assistance that the Committee could provide&#13;
would be to help mobilize the cooperation of the IMF and the World Bank&#13;
in support of the graduation process. The progressive dismantlement of&#13;
trade restrictions and exchange controls can expose a country to two&#13;
types of risks. One is the short-term risk of a sharp deterioration in&#13;
the balance of payments, a risk that is of course reduced the longer the&#13;
period over which the liberalization process is staged. Nevertheless,&#13;
a country's willingness to undertake the risk would be strengthened if&#13;
it had the advance assurance of IMF standby credits to assist in the&#13;
transition to a more liberal trading regime.&#13;
The second type of risk is more long-term. It is that some&#13;
protected and subsidized firms or industries would not be able to survive&#13;
when exposed to more intense international competition. A need would thus&#13;
be created to assist in reorienting the domestic economy towards a new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
industrial structuje in line with the country's comparative advantage.&#13;
As the process of adaptation to a country's resource endowments is not a&#13;
one-shot affair but a continuous process, the country may want to set up&#13;
a capital fund for the rationalization and adaptation of domestic&#13;
industry. A long-term loan from the World Bank to assist in the financing&#13;
of such a fund woul'd materially strengthen the willingness of a country&#13;
to expose its industries to external competitive pressures. Although&#13;
financing for this purpose requires essentially program lending, it&#13;
should be possible to cast the operation in the form of a project loan&#13;
for the country's industrial readaptation fund.&#13;
More important than the specifics of the arrangements at&#13;
this stage, however, would be the acceptance of the legitimacy of graduation&#13;
and the serious need for progress in this matter which the establishment&#13;
of the new GATT committee would imply.&#13;
Summary and Conclusions&#13;
The underlying premise of this paper is that a strong mutuality of&#13;
interest exists among developed and developing countries in preserving a&#13;
reasonably open international trading system based on agreed rules and&#13;
constraints on national behavior. It is further assumed that such a&#13;
system cannot withstand the pressures to which it is increasingly becoming&#13;
exposed when the rules apply to one group of about twenty OECD countries&#13;
while all other countries, regardless of their stage or rate of development,&#13;
are substantially and indefinitely free of such international constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
What is needed, therefore, is some system for graduating selected&#13;
countries from the second to the first group. By graduation we have in&#13;
mind a procedure whereby newly industrializing countries with rapidly&#13;
expanding exports progressively relinquish differentially favorable&#13;
treatment, bring their own trade policies gradually into accord with&#13;
regular GATT and IMF obligations, and pledge themselves to adhere to&#13;
those obligations in the future.&#13;
Our review of current practice demonstrates that, except for&#13;
the limited graduation for individual products under GSP arrangements, no&#13;
established procedure exists at present whereby a country, once declared&#13;
to be in the "developing" group, emerges from that category in terms of&#13;
the application of international trade rules. This situation contrasts&#13;
markedly with that prevailing in the field of international development&#13;
lending where the World Bank, for example, has long applied principles&#13;
of graduation based on per capita income.&#13;
Nor are the principles of graduation currently emerging from&#13;
the multilateral trade negotiations (MTN) very promising. They are&#13;
largely hortatory, couched in general terms, highly fragmented in their&#13;
application, and lacking in clear and regularized procedures for&#13;
implementation.&#13;
As a supplement to whatever does result from the MTN, it is&#13;
suggested that a new Committee on Graduation should be established in&#13;
the GATT. Its functions would be: to develop criteria for graduation;&#13;
to encourage qualifying countries to embark on the process; to enlist&#13;
the cooperation of other countries in facilitating a smooth transition&#13;
to the new status for the graduating country; and to help mobilize the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
cooperation of the World Bank and the IMF in assisting a country to&#13;
overcome any shorL-term balance-of-payments deterioration and longer-term&#13;
structural problems associate4 with any aspect of its graduation program0&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This paper, completed in February 1979,
            starts from the premise that developed and developing
            countries have a common interest in maintaining a reasonably
            open international trading system based on agreed rules and
            constraints on national behaviour. Under the present system
            developing countries are accorded certain forms of
            preferential treatment, but it becomes increasingly
            difficult to justify such treatment as a country's
            development progresses, and there is a risk of the system
            being weakened unless arrangements are devised for
            graduating selected countries into the developed group. The
            paper explores the issues at stake for the LDCs and suggests
            how the graduation problem might be handled in the GATT.
