THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA&#13;
ROAD SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
SECTION A&#13;
Project Description&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Since the late 1980s, Uganda has been one of the fastest growing economies in Africa.&#13;
This is due to the implementation of a series of structural and institutional reforms. The&#13;
Government has developed a comprehensive policy and institutional reform program designed to&#13;
deregulate the economy, eliminate direct state involvement in all but the essential public services,&#13;
and improve institutional efficiency. The Government has embarked on a major privatization&#13;
program, a comprehensive civil service reform and public expenditures reform for both&#13;
development and recurrent budgets, and a decentralization process. These elements of the&#13;
Government's reform program provide the background for the design of the proposed Project.&#13;
2.    As part of the overall strategy to promote growth and poverty alleviation, the Government&#13;
has prepared a 10-year Road Sector Development Program (RSDP). Consistent with the goals of&#13;
its reform program, the RSDP pursues important institutional reform objectives, including the&#13;
privatization of road management and the restructuring of the Ministry of Works, Transport and&#13;
Communications (MOWTC) towards a regulatory role, including consumer protection in safety&#13;
and environmental matters. Furthermore, a US$1.5 billion road expenditure program has been&#13;
identified in support of market integration and export facilitation. One of the primary objectives is&#13;
to support the institutional reform objectives of the Government in the road sector, and to facilitate&#13;
the implementation of the investment components of the RSDP.&#13;
3.    Overall, the Government has made some progress in addressing the major issues identified&#13;
in past consultation with IDA. The areas where progress has been slower include: (i) financial&#13;
restructuring of Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) and elimination of arrears from the&#13;
Government in compensation for the unremunerative services rendered; (ii) definition of a policy&#13;
for the restructuring and/or privatization of the flag airline; (iii) establishment of an autonomous,&#13;
and user financed, Road Agency; and (iv) program management and project implementation&#13;
capabilities, particularly in the road sector.&#13;
4.     Of the sector issues identified above, the ones related to the road sector would be addressed&#13;
under the project as agreed with the Government during preparation of the RSDP. Specifically, the&#13;
project would address the following main issues affecting the performance of MOWTC:&#13;
(i) allocation of responsibilities and decision-making process within the existing organizational set-&#13;
up of MOWTC; and (ii) lack of staff incentives, in view of the uncompetitive remuneration regime.&#13;
5.    The creation of an autonomous Road Agency, by June 1, 2000 would be pursued under the&#13;
project through a study commencing in December 1997 for the establishment of the Agency. The&#13;
study will cover the statutory, legal and regulatory framework required for the establishment and&#13;
operation. It would also assess the funding arrangements for the road sector and for the operation&#13;
of the Road Agency, including the possibility of a user-managed road fund. Prior to the&#13;
establishment of the Agency, consultant services for a transitional institutional arrangement in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
form of a Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU) would be carried out. This institutional&#13;
arrangement is intended to ensure a more effective program management and project&#13;
implementation capability in the road sector, thus creating the conditions for the effective&#13;
implementation of the proposed First Road Sector Project and indeed of the RSDP.&#13;
Project Rationale and Objectives&#13;
6.    A primary objective of the Bank's assistance strategy to Uganda is to reduce poverty,&#13;
through a medium-term strategy focused on private investment-led growth. Lowering transport&#13;
costs, and improving reliability of access to infrastructure, is assumed in the Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) as a key element to facilitate business development. In this context, the CAS sets&#13;
up 12 stabilization and structural reform objectives, of which six have important linkages with the&#13;
proposed project. These areas are indicated below.&#13;
7.    Strengthen the Budgetary Processes. The project would foster the development and&#13;
implementation of a Management Information System for the road sector. The system would&#13;
provide, inter-alia, more timely and reliable information on the implementation of a rolling three-&#13;
year road expenditure program. As such, the road budget can be appropriately linked to the rolling&#13;
three-year Transport Sector Investment and Recurrent Expenditure Plan (TSIREP) and to the&#13;
Budget Framework Paper (BFP), thus contributing to a more effective monitoring framework.&#13;
Furthermore, and through linkages to the road planning system, it would allow for a more rigorous&#13;
definition of priority recurrent and capital spending areas, including the trade-off between them.&#13;
8.    Civil Service Reform. The average annual road expenditure level under the Government&#13;
10-Year RSDP is forecasted to increase by almost three times, with respect to current spending&#13;
levels. This expansion would introduce a major challenge in terms of the needed increase in&#13;
managerial capability within MOWTC, at a time of reductions in civil service to levels&#13;
commensurate with essential functions required of Government. The technical assistance to RAFU&#13;
and the Study on the autonomous Road Agency would be targeted at fostering improved&#13;
managerial capability through performance-based management and the contracting-out of services&#13;
which can be more efficiently provided by the private sector. Furthermore, the Study would&#13;
address the future role of MOWTC after the spin-off of its road execution functions. Consistent&#13;
with the objectives being pursued by the civil service reform program, it is anticipated that&#13;
MOWTC's new role would concentrate on technical and economic regulatory functions, sector&#13;
planning, safety and environmental protection, and budget programming and execution.&#13;
9.    Parastatal Reform/Privatization. By addressing the restructuring of road execution&#13;
functions along business principles through the Road Agency Study, and by fostering the&#13;
contracting out to the private sector of activities which can be competitively provided, the project&#13;
would contribute to the corporatisation of an important sector of economic activity and to private&#13;
sector development. Corporatisation and privatization, in turn, are expected to lead to major&#13;
efficiency gains in road development and maintenance.&#13;
10.   Strengthen the Decentralization Process. Through the Feeder Road Study, the project&#13;
would address issues related to the analysis, financing and execution of rural infrastructure&#13;
improvements in a decentralized context. This would include the identification and prioritization of&#13;
projects, the definition of cost-effective feeder road development standards, and the implementation&#13;
of technical and financial accountability mechanisms. Therefore, this effort would contribute to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
the decentralization program, particularly through strengthening project preparation and&#13;
implementation capabilities at subnational levels of Government,&#13;
11.   Increase Agricultural Output and Improve Environmental Protection. The project would&#13;
lay the basis for cost-effective investments in connecting main roads and in feeder roads. Such&#13;
investments have been identified in the CAS as an important element to foster market access,&#13;
agricultural output growth and diversification. The project would also contribute to a more&#13;
systematic implementation of national environmental policies in the transport sector, through&#13;
capacity building and technical assistance to a new Environmental Liaison Unit within MOWTC.&#13;
12.   Rehabilitate Economic Infrastructure. The feasibility and detailed engineering studies for&#13;
the physical components under the Project are mostly targeted at the cost-effective rehabilitation&#13;
and improvement of main road connections. By focusing on institutional strengthening of planning&#13;
and implementation capacities and on increased private sector participation, studies under the&#13;
Project would also address areas identified in the CAS as key to the rationalization of&#13;
infrastructure management.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
13.   The project would consist of the following components:&#13;
(a)  institutional development and capacity building;&#13;
(b)  sector policy and management studies;&#13;
(c)  infrastructure preparation studies;&#13;
(d) external auditing.&#13;
(a)   Institutional Development and Capacity Building&#13;
14.   This component would include institutional development and capacity building activities to&#13;
support the rationalization of road administration. A Study on Private/Public Partnership in Road&#13;
Management commencing in December 1997 would define the future role and organization of an&#13;
autonomous Road Agency, including the feasibility of introducing a user-based funding system.&#13;
Recommendations of this Study would cover, inter-alia, the statutory, legal, regulatory, and&#13;
financing framework for the establishment and operation of the Agency. The future role of&#13;
MOWTC, after the spin-off of its road execution functions, would also be covered under the&#13;
Study. In addition, capacity-building and training requirements for the new institutional set-up,&#13;
including the assessment of MOWTC's financial management capability, would also be identified&#13;
under the Project. This would contribute to ensure that the road sector has a well functioning&#13;
capacity system in place before starting implementing an expanded investment program.&#13;
15.   Consultant services would be provided under this component for staffing of RAFU and its&#13;
Management Divisions to be created as part of the Nucleus for the Road Agency for a period of&#13;
three years until the Road Agency is institutionalized. RAFU, through its management division(s)&#13;
would constitute the nucleus for the future Road Agency during the transition period and would be&#13;
(i) in charge of road network development and management; (ii) plan and manage network&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
maintenance; and (iii) oversee the implementation of the Program, with emphasis on technical and&#13;
financial monitoring and performance evaluation. Terms of Reference for a Study on the operation&#13;
of the Divisions during the transitional period have already been prepared and proposals invited&#13;
from a short-list of consulting firns. Basically, this Study has three main objectives: (i) design of&#13;
the precise organizational arrangements for the creation and operation of the Units, including the&#13;
interrelationships among them and between them and the existing institutional set-up of MOWTC;&#13;
(ii) quantify the funding requirements for the operation of the Units during the transitional period;&#13;
and (iii) recommend an Action Plan for the implementation of the Study recommendations leading&#13;
to the creation of the Agency by June 1, 2000.&#13;
16.   In addition, and in order to enable MOWTC to implement the sector elements of national&#13;
environmental policy, finance would be provided for capacity building for a new Environmental&#13;
Liaison Unit.&#13;
(b)   Sector Policy and Management Studies&#13;
17.   Studies under this component would cover sector-wide assessments of road safety and of&#13;
network management. A Road Safety Audit Study would collect basic data, and analyze it with a&#13;
view to identify priority actions to reduce the economic and social costs imposed by road accidents.&#13;
These actions would address road engineering design, technical regulations affecting vehicle&#13;
operation, and behavioral measures targeted at road users and pedestrians. A Road Network&#13;
Policy Study would assess issues related to the classification of the road network, and to the&#13;
definition of engineering standards and administrative responsibilities as a function of the role of&#13;
the various types of roads. To strengthen MOWTC's capabilities in planning and financial&#13;
management, the development of a management information system would also be included under&#13;
the component. Recommendations of the Studies would lead to the systemic formulation of action&#13;
plans to be implemented under the proposed follow-up operation, First Road Sector Project&#13;
(FRSP).&#13;
(c)   Infrastructure Preparation Studies&#13;
18.   Financing would provide under the project for the review supporting the preparation of&#13;
engineering design, economic feasibility, and environmental impact studies for the paving of 528&#13;
km of gravel roads and for the strengthening of about 15 5 km of paved roads integrating the&#13;
10,000 km classified road network. These roads have been identified through an economic-based&#13;
prioritization exercise carried out for the preparation of the RSDP, using the Bank's developed&#13;
Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM-I1). A further 500 km of feeder roads would be&#13;
identified, and the engineering designs (including basic environmental impact assessment) prepared,&#13;
through a Feeder Road Study.&#13;
(d)    External Auditing&#13;
19.   This component will support external audit in respect of the project accounts.&#13;
Project Costs and Financing&#13;
20.   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$33.0 million equivalent, excluding taxes&#13;
and duties broken down by component as detailed above. Of the total cost, about US$29.9 million&#13;
or 90% would be in foreign costs. Total costs include about US$2.9 million in physical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
contingencies or about 10% of total base costs; and US$1.0 million in price contingencies or about&#13;
4% of total base costs plus physical contingencies. Price contingencies have been calculated on the&#13;
basis of estimated international inflation of 2.3% from FY1997/98. This inflation rate has been&#13;
used for both foreign and domestic costs as it has been assumed that any difference between&#13;
domestic and international price will be offset by equivalent adjustment in Uganda's foreign&#13;
exchange rate. A summary of the cost estimates is provided in Table 1 below.&#13;

Environmental Issues&#13;
21.    This is considered a Category "C" project, with no environmental risks. The project&#13;
comprises basically of studies and technical assistance. There are no social, gender or resettlement&#13;
issues associated with the project.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement&#13;
22.    Experience from past projects in Uganda indicates that the main risk has been limited&#13;
capacity of the implementation agency, in particular, the ability of the implementing agency to&#13;
efficiently address problems related to contract management, contract administration, and financial&#13;
and technical monitoring. There are substantial delays in the processing and awarding of&#13;
contracts, thus incurring substantially higher costs at the initial stages of commencement, delayed&#13;
completion and loss of investment. The lessons from the modest success of technical assistance&#13;
provided to develop the implementation and planning capacity of MOWTC is that major policy&#13;
changes need full commitment by Government to ensure success. The success of any effort to&#13;
improve public agency performance depends on Government willingness to grant it financial and&#13;
managerial autonomy and that, in the absence of such a commitment, assistance to strengthen such&#13;
agency is 1ikely to accomplish little. The main institutional and policy changes, including&#13;
reorganization and institutional strengthening of road administration, as well as changes in the&#13;
decision-making process, should be undertaken upfront, before commitment to a proposed major&#13;
investment project. Other lessons are that updating of engineering designs before commencement&#13;
of projects are necessary to avoid substantial changes in the field, delays in implementation and&#13;
cost overruns that have made major negative impacts on road development to date. The need to&#13;
develop appropriate monitoring indicators to be used as part of project implementation has also&#13;
emerged as an important lesson in fostering policy and strategic reforms. These lessons have been&#13;
incorporated in the present project design and will also be included in the design of future projects&#13;
through sustained consultations between IDA, GOU, MOWTC and the local communities.&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
23.    The high risk rating allocated to the institutional structure/Road Agency results mainly&#13;
from the risks associated with the mobilization of Government funding for its sustained operation,&#13;
and with the development of the necessary capacity to carry out the RSDP, given the incentive&#13;
problem and the likely competition for qualified human resources in the sector across the Region.&#13;
Although this risk would be further assessed under the Study for the creation of the Agency, it is&#13;
anticipated that by adopting a market-based remuneration system, and by extending contracts on a&#13;
long-term basis, the appropriate staff would be attracted.&#13;
24.    There are three key elements in a strategy to manage this risk. The first is an early-&#13;
warning system, the second is the development of sustained awareness of high-level decision-&#13;
makers to the implementation of reform, and the third is the involvement of the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MOF). The early-warning system would comprise a series of key decisions to be taken by the&#13;
Government as follows: (i) appointment/employment of the Head of Nucleus for RAFU by Board&#13;
Presentation; (ii) approval of an Action Plan recommended by the Study on the Transitional&#13;
Arrangements for the Establishment of the Road Agency (TAERA) by the Credit effectiveness; (iii)&#13;
compliance with key dated targets under the Action Plan during implementation of the project, and&#13;
prior to appraisal of the proposed follow-up First Road Sector Project; and (iv) allocation of&#13;
counterpart funds. The awareness element would be derived from the fact that high-level decision-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
makers are publicly committed to the achievement of the physical elements of the RSDP, and that&#13;
they accept that the existing delivery system would not be capable of implementing an expanded&#13;
road expenditure program. Regarding the involvement of the MOF, it is anticipated that their&#13;
support in ensuring a sustained flow of funds for the future operation of the Agency would be&#13;
secured once they are provided with the evidence of the costs and benefits of the proposed&#13;
institutional arrangement. To this extent, the Bank would work closely with the Government over&#13;
the next three years of project implementation to find workable solutions to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of the reform process leading to the creation of the Road Agency.&#13;
Agreed Actions&#13;
25.   During negotiations, the following agreements were reached with the Government: (i)&#13;
MOWTC shall submit to IDA, audited financial statements within six months of the end of each&#13;
fiscal year; (ii) performance indicators for monitoring the effectiveness of the project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
26.    The following are conditions of effectiveness: (i) the terms and conditions of employment&#13;
of the staff of RAFU as recommended under the Transitional Arrangements for the Establishment&#13;
of a Road Agency (TAERA) study have been drawn up, and the key staff selected; (ii) approval by&#13;
the Government of Uganda of the Action Plan recommended by the Study on the Transitional&#13;
Arrangements for the Establishment of the Road Agency; (iii) the consultants for the studies under&#13;
the project have been selected; (iv) the Head of RAFU has been selected and appointed; and (v) the&#13;
budgeting, accounting and auditing systems for the Project have been established.&#13;

SECTION B&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
27.   The overall responsibility for the project implementation will be vested in the MOWTC.&#13;
The project will be implemented as a part of the Govermment's reform program of Road Sector&#13;
Institutional Development and Capacity Building. MOWTC shall set up a Road Agency&#13;
Formation Unit (RAFU) as the nucleus of the Proposed Road Agency. RAFU, through the&#13;
management division(s) identified under the TAERA study would be established outside the present&#13;
institutional set up of MOWTC but would be accountable to the Permanent Secretary of MOWTC.&#13;
These Management Divisions would take over direct responsibility for implementing the project&#13;
and the RSDP. The Ministry of Local Government (MOLG), through its engineering desk and in&#13;
consultation with the Districts, would provide technical inputs for the Feeder Road Study. A&#13;
Project Inplementation Plan (PIP) was agreed during negotiations.&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
28.   The project would be implemented in accordance with the implementation and procurement&#13;
schedules in the PIP. The PIP would serve as a Handbook to assist project implementation&#13;
agencies in the execution of the project. Annex 4 shows the table of contents for the PIP. The PIP&#13;
contains the following information:&#13;
(i)    detailed description of the project components, budget and implementation&#13;
timetable;&#13;
(ii)   schedule of procurement actions including target dates for each step,&#13;
including standard procurement documents;&#13;
(iii)  schedule of disbursements for each component, including financial&#13;
reporting and audit requirements;&#13;
(iv)   detailed description of the roles and responsibilities of the implementing&#13;
agencies;&#13;
(v)    key monitoring and performance indicators for each component; and&#13;
(vi)  schedule of progress reporting and formal of quarterly reports.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
29.   The consulting services would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants by the World Bank and by the World Bank as an Executing Agency,&#13;
January 1997. Most of the contracts will be awarded following Quality- and Cost-Based Selection&#13;
(QCBS) procedures. Individuals will be hired based on paragraph 5.01 of the guidelines. Audit&#13;
services will be procured by least cost selection from amongst independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
the Association. During project implementation, IDA financed contracts estimated to cost more&#13;
than US$100,00 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals would be subject to prior review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
However, all sole source contracts and extension above these limits of contracts which were&#13;
initially not subject to prior review would be now subject to prior review. The terms of reference&#13;
would require IDA's clearance. The Government would submit signed copies of the contracts to&#13;
IDA before requesting disbursement. MOWTC has adequate staff to handle the procurement; they&#13;
will undertake a training on procurement and familiarize themselves on the current procurement&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
30.   Standard procurement processing times have been discussed with the borrower and the PIP&#13;
has been prepared on this basis. The borrower would update the procurement plan annually.&#13;

34.   MOWTC will maintain appropriate records and accounts for expenditures under the&#13;
project, including SOEs, as well as the Special Account, in accordance with internationally&#13;
acceptable accounting standards; that such records and accounts would be audited by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA; and that the borrower would provide a certified copy of the auditor's&#13;
report, including a separate opinion on the SOEs, and the Special Account to IDA within six&#13;
months of the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
35.   MOWTC and IDA would carry out project monitoring to ensure that the project is&#13;
implemented in accordance with the project implementation plan. It would be based on quarterly&#13;
progress reports to be produced by the implementing agencies. The contents and formats of the&#13;
reports was agreed with the governmenTt during negotiations. IDA would monitor project&#13;
implementation through field visits, implementation support missions, reviews of progress reports&#13;
and consultations with the borrower and implementing agencies. Performance indicators (Annex&#13;
7), discussed and agreed with MOWTC during negotiations, would form the basis for performance&#13;
evaluation. Estimates of the timing of IDA missions, areas of focus, skills requirements and inputs&#13;
are provided in Annex 2. By January 1, 1999, the Government would convene a mid-term review&#13;
to review the overall status of project implementation, adherence to the PIP, and to determine any&#13;
required changes in design and implementation arrangement needed to ensure achievement of the&#13;
project's developmental objectives.&#13;

UGANDA TRANSPORT SECTOR POLICY&#13;
I.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
The following describes the Govemment of Uganda's medium term Strategy for the&#13;
Transport Sector and is to serve as the agreed framework within which the Government&#13;
intends to implement the First Road Sector Project (1997 - 2001) which is the first 5-year&#13;
phase of the 10-Year Road Sector Developmeint Programme (1997 2006).&#13;
2.    GENERAL PRINCIPLES&#13;
Th.e Government's medium term transport strategy hinges on the promotion of cheaper,&#13;
efficient and reliable transport services as the means of providing elctive support to&#13;
increased agricultural and industrial production, trade, tourism, social and administrative&#13;
services. This would ensure an efficient transport sector and would play a critical role for&#13;
the development of an integrated and self-sustaining economy to promote growth in&#13;
Government's strategy for the alleviation of poverty and the economic integration of the&#13;
country as a whole.&#13;
To implement this sector policy empbasis will be placed on the prornotion of active&#13;
public sector participation and the provision of a technically sound, economically&#13;
justified and financially sustainable infrastructure.&#13;
The Government will not, as a rule, directly participate in the provision of transport&#13;
services, except in the case of strategic activities. Its role with respect to the supply of&#13;
transport services is to provide policy guidelines and to clearly defi4e by law and&#13;
efficiently exercise its non-economic regulatory povers ensuring the establishing of a&#13;
level playing field for the competitive provision of services.&#13;
In this context, the Govemment will continue the policy of defacto free access to the&#13;
transport sector market and of letting the market forces determine the tariffs. The&#13;
Government will also continue to place emphasis on the implementation of Axle Load&#13;
Control and transport safety measures for minimisation of road damages and accidents&#13;
respectively. These will be co-ordinated with neighbouring countriies through the East&#13;
African Co-operation Arrangement and the Northem Comdor Transit Agreement to&#13;
ensure efricient and safe use of the road infrastructure.&#13;
However, the Government will continue to play a dominant role in the provision and cost&#13;
effective development of transport infrastructure. In order to sustain this effort,&#13;
appropriate priority is given to the preservation of existing infiastntcture assets. For&#13;
roads, the implementation of Govenunent strategy would also lead 'to an incrased&#13;
participation of the private sector in the preparation, execution and supervision of road&#13;
works, in tandem with efforts to develop the domestic construction and consulting&#13;
industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
3.   ISSUES AND ACTIONS&#13;
3.1 Transport Planning&#13;
Govermment has already commenced on the process of establishing a long-term multi-&#13;
modal transport master plan to guide tie rational and complementary development of all&#13;
the transport modes, namely: road, rail, water and air transport. The process will examine&#13;
the realistic complementality and the appropriate maintenance and improvement&#13;
measures of the various transport modes in terms of safety, efficiency, and cost&#13;
effectiveness for the mobility of people and their goods.&#13;
The Government will coniinue to select and prioritise transport sect6r investmnents and&#13;
recurrent expenditure in a rational manner. This is particularly necessary at this stage,&#13;
when many ongoing and new projects are competing for very limited resources.&#13;
Govenunent will continue to utilise the Public Investment Plan to define its priority&#13;
investment reqfuirements.&#13;
The Public Investment Plan is reviewed annually and additions to this plan is made only&#13;
after thorough analysis of the socio/economic and technical feasibiliiy and viability of the&#13;
project and the resource package availability, safety precautions and: environmental&#13;
consideration.&#13;
3.2   The Road Network&#13;
The key element in the implementation of the Government's Transport Sector Strategy is&#13;
the 10-Year Road Sector Development Progranme (RSDP) (1997 - 2006).&#13;
The RSDP, to be reviewed and updated on an annual basis, focuses on (I) providing an&#13;
efficient, safe and sustainable road network in support of market integration and poverty&#13;
alleviation over a 10-Year period from Fiscal Year 1996/97 - 2005/06, (ii) improving&#13;
managerial and operational efficiency of road administration; and (iii) developing the&#13;
domestic construction industry. The RSDP has been developed aftet a thorough&#13;
optimisation and rationalisation process by viewing road network maintenance and&#13;
improvement as a single process aimed at mniininsing total transport costs in the road&#13;
sector.&#13;
Realistic and efficient implementation mechanisms have been developed to ensure&#13;
maximum implementation efficiency of the programme's managerial and operational&#13;
functions. The full RSDP for the main roads component is estimated to cost&#13;
approximately USS1,500 million and its expenditure and financing programme reflects&#13;
invescment requirements and economic priorities in the context of the macro-economic&#13;
constraints as expressed in terms of domestic cotnterpart fimding and inflows of donor&#13;
assistance. The RSDP has the following three major components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
i)    Main Road Maintenance and rehabilitation to optimise the investment in roads&#13;
and to reinstate and preserve the road network to required level of services;&#13;
ii)   Improvement of parts of the main road network to meet trafie demand safety and&#13;
environmental requirements; and&#13;
iii)   Capacity building in road administration and the local construction industry.&#13;
The RSDP will be implemented in two phases each of 5 years.&#13;
The First Road Sector Project (FRSP) covers the first 5 years of the RSDP from fiscal&#13;
year 1996/97 to 2000/2001.&#13;
3.2.1 Main Roads Maintenance and Rehabilitation&#13;
With respect to main roads maintenance, the outstanding operations of the Four Year&#13;
National Priorities Main Roads Maintenance Program for FY95-98 is being phased out&#13;
into FRSP.&#13;
Financing the mainEenance of main roads is basically the Government's responsibility.&#13;
Accordingly, under the FRSP Government will finance all routine maintenance costs with&#13;
effect from FY 98/99 and seek donor support for continued road rehabilitation and&#13;
periodic maintenance operations. The table below indicates the financing plan of the&#13;
FRSP Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Component.&#13;

Until the envisaged establishment of the user financed Road Authonity / Agency by June&#13;
1, 2000, the Goverunent will continue to release budgeted main roads maintenance funds&#13;
through normal budget procedure.&#13;
3.2.2 Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance&#13;
With respect to the rehabilitation of feeder roads countrywide, the Govermnent is&#13;
pursuing in the first instance improvement of selected roads to all weather road surface&#13;
standard. Priority will be given to those roads which could first unlbck areas with&#13;
potentiaUy high agricultural surplus. Social considerations such as improved access to&#13;
schools and health centres would be supplementary considerations.&#13;
The strategy for feeder roads rehabilitation and maintenance will be reviewed and&#13;
updated under the RSDP to bring it in line with the recent constitutional and legislative&#13;
changes. The responsibility for maintaining feeder roads is already vested in the&#13;
respective districts. The Central Govemnment will continue to match the District&#13;
contributions for local costs of routine manual maintenance through block grants to the&#13;
districts, Plans are underway to develop a prioritised feeder and urban roads' investment&#13;
plan siniiar to that of the main roads.&#13;
3.2.3 Road Improvement Programme&#13;
Under the RSDP, parts of the road network will be upgraded and iniproved as&#13;
economically justified to standards commensurate with the projected traffic demand,&#13;
safety and environmental protection requiremnents. The programme puts emphasis on&#13;
drawing up of a feasible, integrated maintenance and improvement programme for the&#13;
road network in consistence with the overaLl national development oojectives. Under the&#13;
programme various parts of the road network will receive the following measures: (i)&#13;
capacity improvement to ease congestion; (ii) strengthening of weak pavements: (iii)&#13;
upgrading from gravel to bitumen standards; (iv) upgrading of about 2000 km of priority&#13;
feeder roads to the classified road network standards; (v) strengthening of bridges and (vi)&#13;
provision of road safety facilities. A new by-pass of Kampala will also be constructed.&#13;
3.2.4 Institutional Arrangements&#13;
The role of the Government in the development and management of transport&#13;
infrastructure is mostly discharged through MOWTC, and in the case of rural feeder and&#13;
community roads, by the Ministry of Local Government (MOLO).&#13;
In line with Government policy of rationalising the management of sector agencies and of&#13;
reforming the civil service, the potential of the commercialisation of road administration,&#13;
including the involvement of users and other stockholders in road management and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
fnncing, is being assessed. As a result, the Government has already decided to establish&#13;
an autonomous Road Agency/Authority by June 1, 2000.&#13;
The Agency will be responsible for the management, operation, development and&#13;
maintenance of the road network in Uganda. However, as an immediate step towards the&#13;
establishment of the Road Agency/Authority, the Government will establish a Road&#13;
Agency Formnaion Unit (RAFUT). The RAFU consisting of management division(s) will&#13;
be created as a transitional institutional set up until the establishment of the Road&#13;
Agency, and will be established outside the present organisational set-up of the MOWTC&#13;
but accountable to the MOWTC. The division(s) will be staffed by Uganda Experts&#13;
supportcd by Management Consultants personnel commercially hired, and will form the&#13;
nucleus of the future Road Agency/Authority.&#13;
3.2.5 Domestic Construction Industry&#13;
Govemrnment recognises the shortage of technical and management skills in the local&#13;
construction industry both in the public and prvate sectors. The MOWITC Public Works,.&#13;
Training Centre and the Training Production Unit will be strengthened in order to meet&#13;
the training needs of both the public and private sectors of the industry.&#13;
Efforts to develop the domestic construction industry include implementation of&#13;
measures conducive to market creation through contracting out of road works including&#13;
maintenance. Currently, all manual routine maintenance and 60% of mechanised&#13;
maintenance and all periodic maintenance is by contract.&#13;
Targets for the share of contractor executed road maintenance works as contrasted to&#13;
Force Account Works are as tabulated below:&#13;
Private Sector share of the total road maintenance operations budget&#13;
1996/97     1997/98     1998/99    1999/2000    2000/01&#13;
65%         70%         75%          85%         85%&#13;
To improve the domestic contractors access to equipment measures tQ facilitate&#13;
equipment pooling on a commercial basis and ptant acquisition through leasing&#13;
alTangements will be implemented.&#13;
3.3   Commercial Orientation and Improved Financial Autonomy for Uganda&#13;
Railways Corporation (URC)&#13;
Considerate progress has been made in recent years in rehabilitating Uganda Railways&#13;
Corporation's system. However, recent developments in other areas of Goverrunent&#13;
policy will constrain the future size and pattern of URC operadons. Firstly, the extensive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
rehabilitation of the trunk road network has significantly reduced road transport costs.&#13;
Secondly, Government's policy of liberalising the marketing and export of agricultural&#13;
commodities is likely to lead to a reduction in the role of large parastals and to smaller&#13;
consignments. Thirdly, the liberalisation of coffee and fuel trasit traffic would affect&#13;
URC's competitiveness with truckers. It will become increasingly important that for&#13;
URC to effectively compete witti other transport modes, it has to be a viable conunercial&#13;
organisation. Particularly with the continued operations of profitable extemal ferry&#13;
services on Lake Victoria.&#13;
The Goverxment considers URC a strategic transport agency which should remain in the&#13;
public sector but operate as a commercially oriented, increasingly fiuancially autonomous&#13;
entity. It is imperative that a level playing field for the competition provision of services&#13;
is set. This has involved a concemn towards an equitable user taxation policy and the&#13;
provision of targeted service subsidies, wherever deemed required anxd as spelt out in the&#13;
Performance Agreement signed between URC and the Government in 1994. A study on&#13;
the Comparative Taxation and Cost Recovery in the Road and Rail Modes of Transport is&#13;
to be initiated in the RSDP. Government has also taken steps to pay TRC subsidies for&#13;
operating non-commercial services as from July 1994 to September 1996 when the&#13;
opation of loss making services were stopped.&#13;
Government recognises the urgent need to strengthen the import/export route of the&#13;
railways. Plans are underway to secure funds to rehabilitate the penranent way between&#13;
Kampala and Malaba. Government will also explore the possibility of rehabilitating the&#13;
Kampala-Kasese railway line. Considering the role that Railways play in regional&#13;
integration and development, these projects are priority regional projects and candidates&#13;
for regional funding.&#13;
3.4   Air Transportation&#13;
Government's current Air Transportation Policy takes into account changes in the global&#13;
air transport industry that include liberalisation, privatisation, globalisation, anti-trust&#13;
immunities and airline mergers. In broad terms the policy aims at promoting and helping&#13;
the achievemcnt of Uganda's strategic goal of providing safe and efficient air transport&#13;
services.&#13;
In this regard, the Civil Aviation Authority was established in 1994 with the aim to&#13;
provide a safe, secure and efficient aviation industry; and create an enabling environment&#13;
through appropriate legislative and institutional framework to enhance private sector&#13;
participation in all aspects of air transport.&#13;
In line with the Public Enterpnses and Reform and Divestiture Statute. of 1993, the&#13;
national airline, Uganda Airlines has already been slated for privatisation. Consistent&#13;
with this statute and with the various international commitments such as Yammouskro&#13;
Declaration which recommend pooling of its market with markets of other countries in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
the region in order for its industry to become viable, Govemnment is presently working&#13;
out the most viable Divestiture Plan.                      .&#13;
