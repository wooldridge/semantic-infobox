CHINA: ECONOMIC LAW REFORM PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Section A: Detailed Project Description&#13;
Project Obiectives and Overview&#13;
1.    The Project would support China's economic law reform by: (a) assisting in&#13;
the preparation of economic legislation in priority areas; (b) enhancing training&#13;
methods and curricula for law teachers, legal practitioners and legal, judicial&#13;
and other personnel in government departments in the theory and practice of the&#13;
new legal framework; and (c) strengthening the key legal institutions responsible&#13;
for legislation and implementation of economic laws.   Project assistance in the&#13;
first two areas, legislation and training, would be provided through support of&#13;
a program of sub-projects in each area. Institutional support would be provided&#13;
directly to the National People's Congress (NPC) Commission on Legislative&#13;
Affairs (CLA), which is responsible for reviewing all laws submitted to the NPC&#13;
for consistency and technical drafting, as well as for the development of the&#13;
legal profession (lawyers' examination and continuing legal education) and for&#13;
the development of legal information systems. Sub-projects would have no equally&#13;
suitable financing available from UNDP or other external financing agencies.&#13;
LeQislative sub-projects&#13;
2.    Sub-projects under the legislative component would support the preparation&#13;
of laws (and their supplementary regulations and implementing rules) included in&#13;
the NPC five-year (1993-98) legislative agenda, which would assist in the&#13;
development of a market economy (about 54 laws are considered in this category).&#13;
Each sub-project would consist of a package of assistance, designed to provide&#13;
comparative legal experiences and advice on legislative drafting in a specific&#13;
field of law.   Each package would include as necessary:   acquisition and&#13;
translation of materials (particularly foreign laws and regulations); employment&#13;
of international and local legal experts to advise on drafting outline and&#13;
detailed provisions; seminars to discuss initial directions and subsequent&#13;
drafts; and short, focussed study tours by drafting group members to investigate&#13;
specific issues arising in the drafting process. Sub-projects could assist all&#13;
stages of the drafting process, from analysis of need, initial drafting,&#13;
revisions and final debate and review, as appropriate in each area, and all&#13;
relevant levels of the legislative process (line agency, State Council, NPC)&#13;
would be expected to benefit from the assistance so as to develop common&#13;
understandings during the course of the drafting process.&#13;
3.    An initial set of seven legislative sub-projects has been prepared by the&#13;
implementing agencies in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, as Project&#13;
Coordinating Agency, and appraised by and agreed with the Association. Proposed&#13;
credit allocations, subject to final adjustment, are shown below. Subsequent&#13;
sub-projects would be proposed by the implementing agency concerned and, if&#13;
approved by the Project Coordinating Agency in consultation with the core&#13;
legislative agencies, recommended to IDA for its agreement. The initial set of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
sub-projects are described in paragraphs 4 to 11 below. An indicative list of&#13;
other potential sub-projects is given in paragraph 12.&#13;
4.    NPC Commission on LeQislative Affairs (CLA). (Sub-project cost estimate:&#13;
$530,000; Credit financing $320,000).  Assistance would be provided to CLA in&#13;
preparation of legislation in two major areas:   unification of contract law&#13;
(economic contract law, foreign economic contract law and technology contracts);&#13;
and property law.   The unification of the existing contract laws has been&#13;
recommended for some time, and is a high priority in the legislative program.&#13;
Work on the contract law has already begun and is expected to take some time, in&#13;
view of the broad task involved.   The need for better legal regulation of&#13;
property rights (includinq quarantees) is also well-established.  The property&#13;
law is being considered as a separate law, since a comprehensive civil code is&#13;
not even in the legislative agenda ending in 1998.  Civil law and financial law&#13;
expertise will be required to make best use of comparative practice in this area.&#13;
5.    NPC Economic and Finance Committee (EFC).  (Sub-project cost estimate:&#13;
$980,000; Credit financing $700,000). Assistance would be provided to EFC in the&#13;
preparation of legislation in five of the ten areas of legislation for which EFC&#13;
has drafting responsibility under the NPC five-year plan; there are many other&#13;
laws for which EFC has review responsibility. The areas are: bankruptcy law,&#13;
futures market law, state property law, partnership enterprise law, sole&#13;
enterprise law and basic tax law. In view of the already considerable expertise&#13;
in the area of foreign exchange, an EFC request for assistance in the drafting&#13;
of the regulations on foreign exchange has been deferred for later consideration.&#13;
6.    The current bankruDtcv law applies only to state enterprises; bankruptcy&#13;
procedures for other enterprises have a minimal footing in civil procedure&#13;
provisions.  A revised bankruptcy law, applying one set of modern bankruptcy&#13;
rules to all enterprises regardless of ownership, would be an important step&#13;
forward.   The legal rights and responsibilities for the use,  transfer and&#13;
disposition of state-owned assets are also in urgent need of definition. While&#13;
work on futures market legislation is advanced, compatibility with external&#13;
markets and procedures heightens the need for foreign comparative assistance.&#13;
The two enterprise laws, partnership and sole proprietorship, would help to&#13;
complete the range of organizational options under the new legal system, now that&#13;
the company law has come into force. There would be some scope for combining&#13;
comparative interventions in these two areas, however, as expertise and issues&#13;
were likely to have substantial overlap. The basic tax law which EFC is drafting&#13;
will be a tax law of general principles, which will be coordinated with the five&#13;
free standing specialized tax laws for which MOF has requested assistance (see&#13;
para. 10 below).&#13;
7.    State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC).  (Sub-project cost estimate:&#13;
$170,000; Credit financing $100,000). Assistance would be provided to SETC in&#13;
the drafting of the anti-monovolv law, which is under SETC leadership with a&#13;
drafting group comprising SETC officials and those from the State Administration&#13;
of Industry and Commerce (SAIC). There is a need to explore not only developed&#13;
country models of anti-monopoly law and practice (eg., the U.S. and EC), but also&#13;
the experience of other transition economies in tailoring anti-monopoly&#13;
provisions to their economic circumstances. The possibility of establishing a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
national Fair Trade Commission is also under consideration.&#13;
8.    State Commission for the Restructuring of the Economic System (SCRES).&#13;
(Sub-project cost estimate: $87,000; Credit financing $75,000) Assistance would&#13;
be provided to SCRES in the preparation of the shareholding cooperative&#13;
enterprise law.    The proposed shareholdinc cooperative enterprise law is an&#13;
attempt to address an existing phenomenon and offer legal definition and control.&#13;
Some study of cooperative laws of other countries would be useful, although it&#13;
will also be important to utilize corporate legal experts to ensure that the&#13;
resulting form of organization is compatible and can fairly compete with entities&#13;
under the company law and other laws.&#13;
9.    Ministry of Justice (MOJ).  (Sub-project cost estimate: $190,000; Credit&#13;
financing $140,000) Assistance would be provided to MOJ for revisions of the&#13;
lawyers' law, which was drafted before the great changes taking place in Chinese&#13;
legal practice in the last year, and for the preparation of implementing rules&#13;
and standards. Implementing legislation, necessary to carry out the stipulations&#13;
of the law, will include:   Implementing Rules for the Law of the People's&#13;
Republic of China on Lawyers, Standards for Lawyers' Professional Ethics and&#13;
Discipline, Lawyers' rules, and Lawyers' compensation provisions.   In all of&#13;
these areas, comparison with legal practice in other jurisdictions would be&#13;
essential in designing a new system for China's legal profession.&#13;
10.   Ministry of Finance (MOF).  (Sub-project cost estimate: $420,000; Credit&#13;
financing $300,000) Assistance would be provided to MOF's Legal Department for&#13;
the drafting of 6 items of legislation:   the state debt law and five free-&#13;
standing tax laws (enterprise income tax, value-added tax, business tax,&#13;
consumption tax and resource tax).   The state debt law,  being drafted in&#13;
conjunction with MOF's Debt Management Department, will cover issuance,&#13;
circulation and primary and secondary market regulation for state treasury bonds.&#13;
The five tax laws, being drafted in conjunction with MOF's Tax Policy Department,&#13;
will be coordinated with the basic tax law under preparation by EFC, and the tax&#13;
policy components of the proposed Fiscal and Tax Reform Implementation Project.&#13;
Assistance for tax law drafting should be able to take advantage of the&#13;
interrelationships among tax laws, so that, for example, in inter-related areas,&#13;
an expert visiting China or a study tour could cover several topics, and, of&#13;
course, collection of materials could be comprehensive.&#13;
11.   Ministry of Foreiqn Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).  (Sub-project&#13;
cost estimate: $150,000; Credit financing $140,000) Now that the Foreign Trade&#13;
Law has been enacted and come into force, MOFTEC is finalizing the necessary set&#13;
of more than 10 implementing regulations on foreign trade, for issuance on an&#13;
urgent basis. In addition to anti-dumping, countervailing duty and safeguard&#13;
regulations which are well-advanced, assistance is also being provided for&#13;
regulations to cover the administration of import and export of commodities and&#13;
technology, issuance of import and export licenses and business licenses, among&#13;
others.    It  is  crucial  that  the  provisions  of  these  regulations  meet&#13;
international standards, such as GATT, to ensure China's entry into GATT and the&#13;
world trade community. Therefore, outside expertise will be an essential element&#13;
of the drafting process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12.   Other Potential Legislative Sub-proiects.  Several items have been deferred&#13;
for later consideration: CLA's proposal on administrative procedure law; EFC's&#13;
proposal on foreicn exchange regulations; and SCRES' proposal on regulations for&#13;
trading of property rights. Possible assistance to BLA in legislative drafting&#13;
has also been deferred, as UNDP is currently considering BLA's request for&#13;
further support. Moreover, it is the intent of the Project to ensure that BLA&#13;
drafters are included, where possible, in the assistance to principal drafting&#13;
agencies, rather than proposing an entirely separate exposure to comparative&#13;
experience at the time of review of legislation.&#13;
13.   The State Planning Commission (SPC) proposed assistance to the drafting of&#13;
the fixed assets investment law.  Further consideration needs to be given to&#13;
whether any funding should be provided for this proposal to re-orient the law&#13;
based on market principles.   In addition,  a MOFTEC proposal for study of&#13;
conflicts of laws in Hong Kong and Macao has been deferred for later&#13;
consideration.&#13;
Training Sub-prolects&#13;
14.  Sub-projects under the training component would provide support for key&#13;
activities which would either: (a) have a broad impact on legal and other&#13;
professionals teaching, training or implementing economic laws; or (L where the&#13;
impact is more limited, demonstrate instead innovative approaches to meeting the&#13;
changing needs of the legal profession and legal system in the market economy.&#13;
Particular focus would be given to the development of new forms of teaching&#13;
materials and training methods and to the development of legal information&#13;
systems. Sub-projects would be expected to assist short-term needs in practical&#13;
training of legal personnel as well as long-term strengthening of the legal&#13;
training system, such as through curriculum development. Training sub-projects&#13;
would be expected to address primarily in-country training and would not be&#13;
limited to training at the national level in Beijing.&#13;
15.   Three initial sub-projects have been prepared by the implementing agencies&#13;
in consultation with MOF, as Project Coordinating Agency, and appraised by and&#13;
agreed with the Association.   Proposed credit allocations,  subject to final&#13;
adjustment, are shown below. Subsequent sub-projects would be proposed by the&#13;
implementing agency concerned and, if approved by the Project Coordinating Agency&#13;
after review by an expert panel, recommended to IDA for its agreement.   The&#13;
initial sub-projects are described in paragraphs 16-21 below. An indicative list&#13;
of other potential sub-projects is given in paragraph 22.&#13;
16.   Beiiing Lawyers Training Center.   (Sub-project cost estimate: $720,000;&#13;
Credit financing $500,000) The Beijing Lawyers Training Center is jointly funded&#13;
by the Beijing Municipal Justice Bureau and the Beijing Lawyers Association, but&#13;
its management is under the Lawyers Association. The sub-project would provide&#13;
assistance in preparing and purchasing teaching materials, equipping audio-&#13;
visual, simultaneous translation and other facilities, inviting foreign experts&#13;
in selected topics and physical improvements (which would be entirely locally-&#13;
funded). The course topics would include 10 core courses to be given over two&#13;
years:   company law (including relevant foreign law), intellectual property&#13;
rights, financial markets laws, international investment, anti-dumping and anti-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
subsidy laws, international trade rules, legal profession and law firm&#13;
management, bankruptcy, international commercial arbitration, and drafting of&#13;
foreign legal documents.&#13;
17.   The market for this training would be the more than 3,000 lawyers currently&#13;
practicing law in Beijing. The Beijing Municipal Justice Bureau requires all&#13;
lawyers to take about 160 hours per year of additional training in order to&#13;
maintain their lawyers' licenses, as well as at least two training sessions&#13;
(about 2 days each) in professional ethics. These requirements can be fulfilled&#13;
at the Center, as well as by courses given elsewhere, such as MOJ's Senior&#13;
Lawyers Training Center, universities and foreign language courses.&#13;
18.   International Business Management Institute.  (Sub-project cost estimate:&#13;
$520,000; Credit financing $400,000) The International Business Management&#13;
Institute (IBMI) is a national adult training institution of higher learning,&#13;
established under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)&#13;
in 1980. IBMI provides a variety of training programs in foreign trade-related&#13;
matters to managers of foreign trade enterprises and state enterprises with&#13;
foreign trading rights and to commercial counsellors in China's diplomatic&#13;
service, and has a teaching staff of about 100, including full-time and part-time&#13;
faculty. The sub-project would provide assistance to educate those foreign trade&#13;
managers and officials in the newly-enacted Foreign Trade Law and the many&#13;
regulations which will be issued under it. The proposed Foreign Trade Law course&#13;
would also include subjects in international trade law which are essential for&#13;
enterprise managers to export Chinese products and import foreign products&#13;
efficiently, with a view towards China's entry into GATT.&#13;
19.   The proposed course would be offered five times each year, and would cover&#13;
about 5 or 6 topics, for about 50 students.  Assistance would be required in&#13;
purchasing and compiling teaching materials, training teachers, inviting foreign&#13;
experts in international trade for some of the courses (and videotaping their&#13;
lectures for use in other courses) and, to the extent required, specialized&#13;
computer and audio-visual equipment needed for this course.&#13;
20.   China National Lawyers Correspondence Training Center.  (Sub-project cost&#13;
estimate: $590,000; Credit financing: $470,000) The Center was established by&#13;
MOJ in 1985 in Beijing to provide basic legal education and training to a wide&#13;
range of people who do not have opportunities to receive a formal legal education&#13;
but are interested in studying law. The Center has a broad impact in terms of&#13;
the number of its students and the geographic areas covered by its training&#13;
programs. Since 1985, a total of 400,000 people have received training from the&#13;
Center, around 45,000 students are registered each year. The graduates of the&#13;
Center receive  the Da Zhuan  (two-year college)  diploma.   The Center has&#13;
established 30 central stations (one for each province) and 345 guidance stations&#13;
under the Justice Bureau at regional/city level.   Some of the stations are&#13;
located in remote and poor areas or minority nationality areas, where no other&#13;
forms of legal training are available.&#13;
21.   The training program consists of 14 courses including philosophy, political&#13;
economy, literature, legal philosophy, constitution, Chinese legal history,&#13;
criminal law, criminal procedure, civil law, civil procedure, economic law,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
family law, international law, notary and lawyer systems. Training is provided&#13;
through correspondence materials and audio-visual materials, and teachers make&#13;
a circuit of the guidance stations to give lectures and answer questions.&#13;
Financially, the Center is a self supported educational organization, which does&#13;
not receive any budget from the government. Tuition which is currently charged&#13;
at 260 RMB/person has been the major financial source of the Center. While only&#13;
a portion of the Center's activities are related to economic laws, its unique&#13;
function in making basic legal knowledge available to members of the general&#13;
public as well as some in-service training for lawyers would merit Project&#13;
support.&#13;
22.   Other Potential Training Sub-prolects. Several other training sub-projects&#13;
are under consideration, but proposals are not yet ready for review.   These&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   Training in Fiscal Legislation for Local-level Officials:  The MOF Legal&#13;
Department has proposed specialized training of provincial and local&#13;
government finance department/bureau officials in the newly-enacted fiscal&#13;
laws. As this work would be undertaken by MOF's Training Institute, which&#13;
already provides training for these officials in other subjects,&#13;
preparation of a separate proposal for a training sub-project will require&#13;
further internal discussion and coordination within MOF. A well-prepared&#13;
proposal in this area would address the need for better implementation of&#13;
law at the local level.&#13;
(b)   Legal Curriculum Development:  The MOJ Education Department has requested&#13;
assistance under the Project for the preparation of a modern law teaching&#13;
curriculum, focussed on topics in economic law. MOJ is working with MOF&#13;
to prepare a revised proposal focussing on the first set of books to be&#13;
prepared.   Possible topics for the first set include:   international&#13;
economic law, foreign-related economic law, negotiable instruments,&#13;
company law, contract law, real estate law, bankruptcy law, securities&#13;
law,  insurance law and tax law.   An interagency review committee is&#13;
expected to be established to review draft texts, including those drafters&#13;
of  some  of  the  new  laws  who  had gained  substantive  knowledge  of&#13;
comparative legal principles and practice as well as pedagogic experts who&#13;
could recommend new types of teaching methods (case studies, for example)&#13;
to be followed. It would be consistent with the recommendations of the&#13;
training needs assessment to expose the principal authors to new teaching&#13;
methods before they begin preparation of the materials.&#13;
(c)   State Education Commission (SEdC):  SEdC  has  proposed  introducing  a&#13;
training program in economic law, to be offered at Beijing Law Faculty and&#13;
Fudan Law Faculty in Shanghai.   Further work is necessary to develop a&#13;
proposal which addresses the management of the program, the respective&#13;
roles of the SEdC and the law faculties, and the detailed planning and&#13;
implementing of the training program itself. The list of topics proposed&#13;
(including international trade and financial law, company law, tax laws,&#13;
intellectual property law and real estate law) falls squarely within the&#13;
objectives of the proposed Project, so that if a well-designed proposal&#13;
could be prepared it would be eligible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d)   Judicial  Training  Institute:    Training  for  senior  judges  has  been&#13;
supported by other donors in the past. Preparations are in progress for&#13;
the establishment of a new Judicial Training Institute.  To the extent&#13;
that other (grant) financing is not available, a proposal for assistance&#13;
under the Project may be forthcoming.&#13;
Institutional Support&#13;
23.   The institutional support component would provide assistance to the CLA,&#13;
BLA and MOJ.&#13;
(a)   CLA (Cost estimate $200,000): CLA has principal responsibility for&#13;
reviewing all draft legislation submitted to the NPC and its&#13;
Standing Committee, whether prepared at the NPC or by line agencies&#13;
under BLA's supervision.   Modernizing CLA's office technology to&#13;
enable draft legislation to be revised, prepared and circulated&#13;
quickly and efficiently, often under the pressure of legislative&#13;
sessions, would be assisted through provision of office equipment,&#13;
computers and printers. CLA's existing capacity for comparative law&#13;
research would be strengthened by the addition of legal databases&#13;
for countries of especial comparative relevance for the new laws&#13;
under preparation.&#13;
(b)   BLA (Cost estimate: $620,000):  BLA has developed its own Chinese&#13;
law database, with support under the UNDP Legislative Drafting&#13;
Project.     This  database  includes  NPC  laws,  State  Council&#13;
regulations, administrative rules of central ministries, and&#13;
provincial  regulations  and  administrative  rules.    To  ensure&#13;
effective coverage of legislation and to strengthen drafting&#13;
capacity at the Ministerial and provincial level, the database would&#13;
be extended through provision of workstations and network&#13;
connections to 30 central departments and agencies; provincial level&#13;
government legislative bureaus may also be included. Assistance to&#13;
BLA in developing and maintaining the database and network would be&#13;
provided. In the future, other entities such as law faculties and&#13;
law firms could be provided access to this system, on a commercial&#13;
basis.&#13;
(c)   MOJ   (Cost estimate: under finalization):   MOJ is undertaking a&#13;
reform of the lawyers examination system, to upgrade the quality and&#13;
consistency of testing. A new procedure for developing and using&#13;
testing material is under study, as is a modernized testing&#13;
administration. Assistance would be provided to provide comparative&#13;
experience and technical support.&#13;
Section B: Prolect Administration and Implementation&#13;
Proiect Implementation Plan&#13;
24.   A Project Implementation Plan was agreed with MOF during the appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Its principal contents are set out below.&#13;
25.   Project Coordinating Agency.  The World Bank Department of MOF would be the&#13;
overall Project Coordinating Agency, responsible for the day-to-day project&#13;
coordinating work.   This project coordination would be carried out by the&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training Division, and would include:&#13;
(a)   sub-project Preparation and review--working with potential sub-project&#13;
entities to plan and prepare sub-projects and reviewing sub-project proposals for&#13;
consistency with Project objectives, eligibility criteria, internal consistency,&#13;
relevance of content, reasonableness of cost estimates and cost-sharing&#13;
arrangements and adequacy of implementation arrangements;&#13;
(b)   sub-project approval--consulting with IDA on draft sub-project proposals&#13;
and furnishing final proposals as agreed by MOF to IDA for approval;&#13;
(c)   sub-project implementation- -assisting sub-project entities in applying Bank&#13;
guidelines on procurement and disbursement to the hiring of foreign experts,&#13;
procurement of equipment and materials, planning of study tours and organization&#13;
of seminars;&#13;
(d)   sub-proiect monitoring--preparing (and furnishing to IDA) annual work plans&#13;
and semi-annual Project progress reports, along with the semi-annual sub-project&#13;
progress reports prepared by sub-project entities; preparing for the Project mid-&#13;
term review; and assessing the impact of each sub-project upon completion and the&#13;
impact of the Project as a whole in a Project Completion Report;&#13;
(e~) overall Proiect implementation--assisting agencies under the institutional&#13;
support component; preparing and presenting withdrawal requests to the Bank,&#13;
managing the Special Account, maintaining Project accounts and records and&#13;
ensuring their required annual audit; and convening periodic (at least semi-&#13;
annual) meetings of the Legislative Advisory Group (see para. 27).&#13;
MOF would employ a legal consultant in Beijing to assist in the preparation,&#13;
review and supervision of sub-projects as outlined above, to be financed out of&#13;
the proceeds of the Credit. Terms of reference and the selection process for&#13;
the legal consultant were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
26.   The entity implementing each sub-project and the agencies under the&#13;
institutional support component would be responsible for basic preparation and&#13;
implementation. Semi-annual progress reports would be prepared and furnished by&#13;
these entities to MOF for consolidation and comment.&#13;
27.   Legislative Sub-project Approval Process.  MOF would consult with other&#13;
relevant agencies in the selection of sub-projects and review of their&#13;
implementation. For legislative sub-projects, a Legislative Advisory Group would&#13;
be constituted, inter alia, of senior representatives of the CLA and the EFC,&#13;
BLA, and SCRES.   MOF would convene meetings of the Legislative Advisory Group&#13;
as needed, but at least every six months, at intervals which would allow input&#13;
from this Group into the semi-annual progress reports and MOF's annual work&#13;
plans. The participation of the Legislative Advisory Group would ensure that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
legislative sub-projects met the eligibility criteria  (para.2).  During the&#13;
annual work plan review (para. 29), MOF and IDA would agree on laws eligible for&#13;
assistance in each year. Detailed sub-project proposals would be prepared as&#13;
outlined in para. 25 and retained by MOF for review by IDA supervision mission.&#13;
However, MOF would request IDA approval of legislative sub-projects using a&#13;
simplified approval sheet.&#13;
28.   Training Sub-project Approval Process.   For training sub-projects, MOF&#13;
would maintain a list agreed with the Bank of experts in legal education and&#13;
training (including international and comparative expertise as needed), and would&#13;
request at least three experts to review each training sub-project proposal.&#13;
Selection of the three experts to review each proposal would depend on expertise&#13;
and avoidance of any conflicts of interest. MOF would invite experts to be kept&#13;
on a roster, under standard agreement on a timely review and on reasonable&#13;
compensation on a per review basis. Fees for review by these experts would be&#13;
eligible for financing under the Credit. Agreement on a roster and contractual&#13;
arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
29.   Monitoring and Progress Reporting.  Annual work plans would be prepared by&#13;
MOF and furnished to IDA for discussion and concurrence. Each work plan would&#13;
include: sub-projects under preparation (brief summary of content, tentative&#13;
amount and status of preparation); sub-projects in implementation (listing of&#13;
planned activities, by sub-project, with commentary); sub-projects scheduled for&#13;
completion and evaluation.   Work plans for 1994 and 1995 were agreed at&#13;
negotiations; proposed work plans for each year thereafter would be provided to&#13;
IDA for review and approval by October 31 of the preceding year. To aid in this&#13;
process, MOF would require sub-project entities to provide sub-project work plans&#13;
as part of sub-project proposals, updated in semi-annual sub-project progress&#13;
reports. The information from these plans would be consolidated into the overall&#13;
Project work plans prepared by MOF.&#13;
30.   Semi-annual Project progress reports would be prepared based on sub-project&#13;
progress reports and actual implementation experience, highlighting activities&#13;
undertaken, disbursements, Project progress and implementation issues.  Semi-&#13;
annual Project progress reports (incorporating sub-project semi-annual progress&#13;
reports) (para. 25) would be provided to IDA by March 1 and September 1 in each&#13;
year.   Key indicators for Project monitoring would be the preparation and&#13;
eventual enactment of well-drafted and well-considered laws and regulations&#13;
resulting from legislative sub-projects and the development of new training&#13;
mechanisms and effective training courses resulting from training sub-projects.&#13;
A mid-term review of Project progress and prospects would be jointly undertaken&#13;
by MOP and IDA by December 31, 1996, and a Project Completion report would be&#13;
prepared by MOF within six months after the Closing Date (June 30, 1999). The&#13;
Project Completion Date is December 31, 1998.   Agreement on a semi-annual&#13;
Project progress report form and a model sub-project progress report form was&#13;
confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
31.   Supervision Arrangements.    IDA staff (task manager, assisted by other&#13;
staff and consultants with specialized expertise) responsibilities during the&#13;
course of Project implementation would include:  (a)  review of draft and final&#13;
sub-project  proposals,   providing  comments  and  guidance  on  revisions;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(b)   approval of sub-project proposals and allocation of Credit funds, and&#13;
advising MOF of approvals and allocations; (c)  review and approval of annual&#13;
work plans and review and comment on semi-annual Project progress reports;&#13;
(d)   participation in mid-term review; (e) providing guidance to sub-project&#13;
entities on substantive aspects of sub-project implementation, including&#13;
selection of experts, study tour destinations and review of legislation produced&#13;
under sub-projects; and (f) undertaking semi-annual supervision missions in the&#13;
spring and fall of each year to discuss progress (following receipt of semi-&#13;
annual Progress report) in preparation and implementation of sub-projects and to&#13;
reach agreement on annual work plans.  IDA staff would also participate in a&#13;
Project Launch Workshop, to be organized by MOF shortly after Credit&#13;
effectiveness (fall 1994), to familiarize sub-project entities and potential sub-&#13;
project entities with Project objectives and procedures.&#13;
Proiect Administration&#13;
32.   Proiect Cost and Financing Plan.  The total Project cost is estimated at&#13;
$13.3 million. The foreign cost is an estimated $10 million. The local cost is&#13;
expected to be Y28.5 million ($3.3 million), not including taxes and duties, from&#13;
which the Project, related imports and overseas consultants' fees and&#13;
remuneration are exempt. The Project cost is based on the initial sub-project&#13;
cost estimates and recent experience with other free-standing technical&#13;
assistance projects in China.&#13;
33.   The Project would be financed in part by a Development Credit of SDR 6.9&#13;
million ($10 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity.&#13;
The Credit would finance the cost of foreign and local consultants, in-country&#13;
training, overseas study tours and equipment for training and institutional&#13;
support.  Local financing of Y28.5 million (about $3.3 million), amounting to&#13;
approximately 25% of Project costs, would be provided by the Government and&#13;
implementing  entities  and agencies.    Credit  funds  would be provided  to&#13;
implementing agencies on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association,&#13;
which would include provision of Credit proceeds on a grant basis to agencies&#13;
financed by the government budget.&#13;
34.   Procurement.  Goods (equipment and materials) would be procured through&#13;
local shopping procedures (for contracts below $100,000 equivalent) and local&#13;
competitive bidding procedures (for contracts between $100,000 and $200,000&#13;
equivalent).   Proprietary teaching materials,  books and journals would be&#13;
procured directly from the supplier, under procedures satisfactory to the&#13;
Association.    Qualified international and local consultants would be engaged&#13;
under the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants.   Contracts for goods&#13;
over $200,000 would be subject to international competitive bidding procedures&#13;
including preference for domestic manufacturers.   All goods contracts over&#13;
$200,000 would be subject to prior review as would the first three consultants'&#13;
services contracts under each Sub-project and all other consultant contracts over&#13;
$15,000 equivalent.&#13;
35.   Disbursement.   Disbursement would be made for:  (a) goods, at 100% of&#13;
foreign expenditures, 100t of local expenditures (ex-factory) and 75t of&#13;
expenditures for other items procured locally; and (b) consultants' services,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
training and study tours, 100% of expenditures.   A Special Account with an&#13;
initial deposit of $900,000 would be established in a commercial bank, managed&#13;
by MOF.   Disbursement against contracts  for goods not exceeding $100,000&#13;
equivalent and for consultants' services not exceeding $15,000 equivalent and for&#13;
study tours would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs).&#13;
Retroactive financing of up to SDR 200,000 may be required for more urgent&#13;
expenditures under pre-approved legislative sub-projects incurred after June 27,&#13;
1994.&#13;
36.   Accounting and Audit Arrangements.  The Project accounts and the Special&#13;
Account would be maintained by MOF. The Project accounts, including the Special&#13;
Account and the documentation for SOEs, would be subject to an annual audit by&#13;
an independent auditor satisfactory to IDA, expected to be the Audit&#13;
Administration of China. The audit report, including a separate opinion on SOEs&#13;
and the Special Account, would be furnished to IDA within six months of the end&#13;
of the Government's fiscal year.&#13;

CHINA: ECONOMIC LAW REFORM PROJECT&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
TRAINING PLAN&#13;
1.    Training under the Project would be provided under the selected training&#13;
sub-projects.    The training institutions would provide  training in China&#13;
primarily in Chinese laws and in those international laws and practices which are&#13;
essential to the market economy in China, such as international trade law.&#13;
Training institutions are expected to include non-governmental training centers&#13;
(such as the Beijing Lawyers Training Center), governmental training institutes&#13;
(such as IBMI), as well as training offered at existing law faculties and&#13;
universities.&#13;
2.    Training sub-projects are intended to promote new training methodologies&#13;
suited to the representation of clients and enforcement of laws in market&#13;
transactions, which is different from the role of lawyers and officials in the&#13;
former planned economy. This would be accomplished through the preparation of&#13;
new teaching materials, as well as through the training of trainers in new&#13;
methods.&#13;
3.    Most of the trainers are expected to be local professionals, but where the&#13;
subject matter includes foreign laws, foreign experts would be invited to teach&#13;
the courses. An effort would be made to make use of videotape and audiotape to&#13;
record such courses, with permission, so that foreign lecturers could receive the&#13;
widest possible audience.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Economic Law Reform Project will
            assist China in improving the legal framework to support
            economic reform by: (a) strengthening the preparation of
            economic legislation in priority areas; (b) enhance training
            methods, curricula and opportunities for law teachers, legal
            practitioners and legal, judicial and other government
            personnel in the theory and practice of the new legal
            framework; and (c) strengthening the key legal institutions
            responsible for legislation and the implementation of
            economic laws. The project will consist of three parts:
            sub-projects to support preparation of legislation;
            sub-projects to support legal training; and institutional support.
