            Franchising in health : emerging models,
            experiences, and challenges in primary care
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A franchise is a type of business model
            in which a firm (the franchiser) licenses independent
            businesses (franchisees) to operate under its brand name. A
            firm might choose to expand its business through franchising
            because the arrangement shifts capital investment and
            day-to-day managerial responsibilities to independent
            businesses, overcoming two major constraints to rapid
            growth. The franchiser typically has established a
            successful product line and so is able to provide
            specialized business strategies to franchisees in exchange
            for a fixed fee or royalty payment. Franchisers in the
            health sector, often supported by international donors and
            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), establish protocols,
            provide training for health workers, certify those who
            qualify, monitor the performance of franchisees, and provide
            bulk procurement and brand marketing.
