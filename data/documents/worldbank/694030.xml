This report is based on the findings of the pre-appraisal/appraisal mission that visited Pakistan in&#13;
March/April 1996, and reflects revisions to accommodate overall cuts to the project prior to ECNEC&#13;
approval in May 1997. The appraisal mission comprised: A.M. Jeria (Mission Leader and Task&#13;
Manager); I. Appasamy (Operations Analyst); A. Naqvi (Education Specialist); M. Sutton (Education&#13;
Specialist, Consultant); N. Abbas (SAP Multi-Donor Support Unit, Pakistan); K. Hovde (Community&#13;
Participation/NGOs Specialist, Consultant); I. Bokhari (Education, Consultant); and J. Malmborg&#13;
(Architect, Consultant). S. Shakil (Aga Khan Education Services) assisted with specific aspects of project&#13;
components in NA. The support during project preparation of the Aga Khan Development Network, the&#13;
Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development Fund and the SAP Multi-Donor Support Unit is&#13;
gratefully acknowledged. D. Ricks (SASED) provided invaluable support in the production of project&#13;
documentation. Project processing was supervised by M. Nishimizu (then Director, SAI), F. Ahmed&#13;
(then Project Advisor and Acting Director, SAl) and B. Herz (then Chief, SAlPH). The peer reviewers&#13;
for the project were: W. Heneveld (LCSHD); V. Greaney (SASED); and C. Valdivieso (PRMGE).&#13;

Project Description:  Pakistan's social indicators are considerably worse than most other comparable&#13;
countries. Northern Pakistan, comprising the Northern Areas (NA) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir&#13;
(AJK), is particularly disadvantaged. Nearly four million people live in these regions, 90 percent in&#13;
rural villages scattered over a vast area of exceptionally mountainous terrain. The NA are among the&#13;
1 British Department for International Development (DFID - formerly British ODA) has proposed&#13;
financing a portion of project activities in the Northern Areas, amounting to approximately US$ 3.1 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
most backward areas in Pakistan in terms of educational indicators, particularly for girls. The&#13;
percentage of school-age children in school (participation rate) is estimated to be 74 percent for boys&#13;
and 35 percent for girls at the primary level, and 54 percent for boys and 18 percent for girls at the&#13;
middle levels. Access in AJK is much better, although girls still lag behind. The quality of&#13;
education, however, is poor in both regions: although there is little systematic information on&#13;
learning levels, both the NA and AJK fell below country averages on a recent test of mathematics and&#13;
Urdu at the primary level. Nearly 58 percent of teachers in elementary schools in NA lack teaching&#13;
credentials; most teachers in both regions work simultaneously with several grades yet virtually none&#13;
have any training in multigrade instruction or in the use of supporting materials. Low levels of non-&#13;
salary recurrent spending have contributed to impoverished and structurally unsound classroom&#13;
environments. More than 30 percent of schools in AJK are classified as "dangerous" or "shelterless."&#13;
Management systems and skills are weak in both regions, and, until recently, community participation&#13;
in the education system has been limited or non-existent.&#13;
The project would cover education from Katchi (kindergarten) to grade 8, with emphasis on the&#13;
primary years and girls' education. The project's main objectives are to: (a) improve the quality of&#13;
education in order to increase learning achievement and completion rates in elementary education; (b)&#13;
increase access, equity and retention of students, particularly girls; (c) strengthen institutional capacity&#13;
to manage and supervise education programs; and (d) encourage greater community and NGO&#13;
participation. The project would follow a program approach, which requires agreements between the&#13;
Government and The International Development Association (IDA) on the elementary education&#13;
policies, strategies, programs and budgets, including directions for reform, over the life of the&#13;
project. Statements of strategies and priorities were developed by both NA and AJK during the&#13;
course of project preparation. Although priorities and strategies differ by region, common themes&#13;
include: investments in teacher training, materials development, and the introduction of continuous&#13;
assessment techniques; replacement of dangerous classrooms and construction of school buildings for&#13;
currently shelterless schools, and (in the NA) community-run schools; upgrading of management tools&#13;
and skills; and commitment to increased community participation in school management issues.&#13;
Project support would be linked to satisfactory implementation of the agreed program, and annual&#13;
operational plans and targets tied to annual reviews.&#13;
Benefits: The project would directly or indirectly benefit over one million children over the five&#13;
years of project implementation, through a combination of improvements in school quality and access.&#13;
In the NA, it is expected that the project would expand overall enrollments at the elementary level by&#13;
approximately 28 percent over current levels and double the number of girls in school. An increased&#13;
level of literacy improves economic productivity and income-earning potential for both sexes; for&#13;
girls, literacy is known to have a positive effect on lowering population growth and infant mortality.&#13;
Further benefits expected from the project include: (a) improvements in learning achievement&#13;
through better trained teachers, more appropriate materials, and a more hospitable learning&#13;
environment; (b) lower teacher absenteeism, improved school maintenance, and improved system&#13;
accountability through community participation in school management; (c) a reduction in dropout rates&#13;
(particularly for girls) and higher overall completion rates through a combination of improvements in&#13;
the learning environment, community sensitization and monitoring, the recruitment of female&#13;
teachers, and improved access at the middle levels; (d) improved availability of qualified female&#13;
teachers (in the NA); and (e) improvements in system management and resource allocation through&#13;
better information and planning practices and more qualified staff.&#13;
Risks: During preparation, an effort has been made to analyze and reduce project risks.&#13;
Nevertheless, risks remain especially given the remoteness of the regions and their lack of experience&#13;
(ii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
with projects. The project faces risks related to (a) design; (b) implementation; (c) financial&#13;
environment; and (d) political factors. With regard to project design, the heavy emphasis on&#13;
community participation presents both potential benefits and risks. Reliance on community&#13;
participation in construction may mean that construction moves more slowly. In AJK there is likely&#13;
to be substantial institutional resistance to meaningful community involvement in school affairs, while&#13;
in the NA the reliance on community schools as the principal means for increasing access to education&#13;
risks overburdening communities and furthering inequities between the communities that can&#13;
contribute a lot, and those that can contribute very little to their children's education. The project has&#13;
attempted to mitigate these risks through the use of pilots, drawing on local expertise whenever&#13;
possible, and supporting and further developing the community school program. While the risks still&#13;
exist, we believe the potential benefits outweigh them. The absence or poor quality of basic data in&#13;
both areas also means that estimates of system needs may be considerably off. The project design has&#13;
attempted to take this risk into account by adopting a more flexible approach with Annual Reviews.&#13;
Implementation risks include the executing agencies' relatively weak institutional capacity, little or no&#13;
experience with Bank procedures and managerial requirements, heavy internal bureaucracy, and the&#13;
possible turnover of key managers and staff. The project addresses the first two of these risks&#13;
through keeping project components as simple as possible, relying whenever possible on locally&#13;
available expertise, strengthening critical Department of Education (DOE) departments or areas, and&#13;
including technical assistance and training. While the project cannot change the Government's rules&#13;
of business, it seeks to avoid some levels of bureaucracy through dealing directly with the AJK and&#13;
NA Governments as much as possible, rather than channelling everything though a federal level&#13;
coordination unit. The last risk -- turnover of key managers and staff -- can without doubt have the&#13;
most negative effects on project implementation. Actions taken or to be taken to reduce this risk&#13;
include making sure the project is broadly discussed and supported within the existing institutions as&#13;
part of project preparation, planning for the provision of ongoing training and technical assistance,&#13;
and using Annual Reviews as a forum for raising overall concerns with the Government.&#13;
The principal financial risk to the project is the possible deleterious effects of federal budget cutbacks&#13;
on overall budgetary allocations to the NA and AJK, and within these, specifically to education. A&#13;
Social Action Program (SAP)-type project is the logical framework for addressing these issues. Risks&#13;
related to political factors include interference in site selection for construction of schools and in&#13;
teacher appointments, as well as changes of Government, a possible flare-up of sectarian violence in&#13;
the NA, or a change in the overall status of AJK. The first of these two risks will be addressed&#13;
through the use of school mapping results for the rational selection of school sites and through the use&#13;
of merit-based criteria in the hiring of teachers. Over the remaining risks, of course, the project has&#13;
no control. Given the high priority of improving education in these neglected areas, the risks overall&#13;
are considered acceptable.&#13;

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN&#13;
NORTHERN EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
I. SECTORAL BACKGROUND AND ISSUES&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.1        Pakistan's strong economic performance over the past two decades has contributed to a&#13;
significant reduction in poverty, as measured by consumption indicators. Many years of neglect of&#13;
the social sectors, however, have led to social indicators that are considerably worse than most other&#13;
countries at similar levels of development.2 Only 35 percent of the population is estimated to be&#13;
literate, and there are wide gender disparities in education, health, and earnings potential. In 1991,&#13;
only 46 percent of primary and 21 percent of secondary school-age children were estimated to be&#13;
enrolled at the primary and secondary levels, respectively -- half the average enrollment rates for all&#13;
low-income countries. A population growth rate of 3 percent also threatens per capita consumption&#13;
gains and increases pressure for schooling. In an effort to redress the prior neglect of social services,&#13;
the Federal Government in 1993 adopted a Social Action Programme (SAP), which is partially funded&#13;
with assistance from donors, including IDA.&#13;
1.2        Northern Pakistan, consisting of the Northern Areas (NA) and Azad Jammu and&#13;
Kashmir (AJK), is particularly disadvantaged and has received a very small share of the country's&#13;
increased wealth. Both areas remain overwhelmingly rural with limited access to communications and&#13;
road infrastructure. Ninety-one percent of the NA's 0.8 million people live in rural areas, most in&#13;
small villages scattered over a vast area of exceptionally mountainous terrain. Eighty-nine percent of&#13;
AJK's approximately 3.5 million people also live in rural areas.4 Poverty is pervasive and access to&#13;
basic social services is often limited or unavailable. Infant and child mortality are significantly above&#13;
national levels. Average annual income in Pakistan in 1991 was approximately Rs. 10,300, but only&#13;
about Rs.5,600 in NA and Rs.7,300 in AJK.5  With the exception of modest general support&#13;
through SAP, hardly any external donor assistance for the social sectors has reached these two remote&#13;
regions.&#13;
1.3        As in the rest of Pakistan, the provision of education in both the NA and AJK is divided&#13;
into three main cycles: primary schools provide the entire primary cycle (grades K-5)6; middle&#13;
schools provide both primary and middle (grades 6-8) cycles, and high schools provide primary,&#13;
middle and secondary (grades 9-10) cycles. Government administration of the educational system also&#13;

(UNDP 1996).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

follows a similar pattern to the rest of the country, although there are important differences between&#13;
AJK and the NA in terms of decision-making authority. Both areas have a central institution (the&#13;
Directorate of Education, in the case of the NA; the Department of Education in AJK) responsible for&#13;
policy making and planning and district offices responsible for direct school supervision, data&#13;
collection, and some decisions on personnel (five district offices in the case of the NA, and seven in&#13;
AJK7). Both the NA and AJK are also considered "special areas" within Pakistan and are&#13;
represented at the federal level by the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Northern Areas and States and&#13;
Frontier Regions (KANA/SAFRON). AJK has considerable autonomy in governmental affairs,&#13;
however, including its own president and parliament, and the ability to sanction civil service posts&#13;
(including teachers). The NA administration answers directly to the KANA/SAFRON Ministry,&#13;
although a local council with limited political powers was authorized in 1994.&#13;
B. Overview of Education in the Northern Areas&#13;
1.4         The Northern Areas are among the most backward areas of Pakistan in terms of&#13;
educational indicators. The literacy rate of 14.7 percent reported by the 1981 Census (24 percent for&#13;
males and 3 percent for females) was well below the then national average of 26 percent. Enrollment&#13;
at the primary level covers just over half of school-age children, and girls enrollments seriously lag&#13;
behind those of boys. As of 1994, there were 50,799 boys and 23,228 girls enrolled in primary&#13;
schools, representing approximately 74 and 35 percent of the corresponding school-age population.8&#13;
At the middle level, these numbers were 15,832 boys and 4,989 girls, or approximately 54 percent&#13;
and 18 percent of the corresponding school age population, respectively. These statistics, however,&#13;
also mask significant inequalities between the five administrative districts. In Diamer district, for&#13;
example, girls' enrollment at the primary level is only about 14 percent of the corresponding school-&#13;
age population (see Annex 1 for additional information on education statistics).&#13;
1.5        There is little objective information on learning levels in the NA, but the information&#13;
available suggests that the quality of education offered is extremely low. Existing Government exams&#13;
for grade 8 completers and matric (grade 10) level do not offer much information about true learning&#13;
levels, since tests can be passed through rote memorization and there are problems with the security&#13;
of test administration. The Aga Khan Education Service (AKESP), the largest NGO provider of&#13;
educational services in the region, administers a screening test for potential teachers that is geared to&#13;
mastery of approximately a grade 4 level of content. Failure rates for this exam are very high, even&#13;
for holders of matric and higher certification. In mid-1995, the Multi-Donor Support Unit (MSU) for&#13;
the SAP program supported a national achievement survey of mathematics, general knowledge and&#13;
7 Two additional districts were created in AJK in late 1995. All statistical information presented on AJK in&#13;
this report, however, shows only the five original districts.&#13;
8 These numbers do not include data on private school. enrollments (other than AKESP) which are not&#13;
available for 1994. According to 1992-93 data, however, private enrollments made up 5 percent of total&#13;
enrollments. It is likely, therefore, that the estimated participation figure for boys, in particular, is slightly&#13;
higher, as boys' enrollment in private schools outstrips that of girls.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

comprehension among grade 5 students and teachers. Scores of both students and teachers in the NA&#13;
were the lowest in the nation, with girl students scoring the lowest of all.9&#13;
1.6         The Government is the largest provider of educational services in the NA, with direct&#13;
responsibility for 782 schools (primary through high school), and about 84 percent of enrollments.'0&#13;
AKESP is the second largest provider, accounting for 126 schools and 16 percent of enrollment, but&#13;
35 percent of female enrollment (all levels). AKESP schools originated as girls schools, although&#13;
many currently admit boys at the primary level. AKESP, however, only operates schools in two of&#13;
the five administrative districts (Gilgit and Ghizer). The army and the private sector operate 52&#13;
schools, the vast majority in Gilgit district (34). As of 1992-93, enrollment in independent private&#13;
schools was estimated at approximately five percent of total enrollments -- this percentage may have&#13;
increased slightly over the past three years. While some are being run by small NGOs and "welfare&#13;
organizations," many are also run by private entrepreneurs on a for-profit basis.&#13;
1.7         Under the aegis of the SAP program, during 1995 the Government in cooperation with&#13;
the Aga Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP) also sponsored the establishment of 250 "community&#13;
schools," distributed equally across the five districts. These schools are established in partnership&#13;
with village organizations (VOs), which assume the responsibility of hiring a teacher, finding&#13;
classroom space, and overseeing the non-academic aspects of school administration. The&#13;
Government, in turn, sets up an account of Rs. 100,000 in the name of the school, the interest from&#13;
which (approximately Rs. 1,400 per month) pays the salary of the teacher. The Directorate of&#13;
Education also retains responsibility for setting the criteria for teacher eligibility, and for academic&#13;
supervision. The vast majority of these schools have been established either as girls schools or&#13;
coeducational primary schools. Nearly half of the teachers hired through the program thus far are&#13;
female, compared to the regular Government system where only 14 percent are female. As of early&#13;
1996, enrollment in community schools stood at 12,088 students (about 16 percent of total primary&#13;
enrollment in 1994). " About 64 percent of community school enrollments were female.&#13;
C. Overview of Education in Azad Jammu and Kashmir&#13;
1.8        In contrast to the NA, literacy in AJK is estimated in 1995 to be at 43 percent of the&#13;
population, although only 12 percent for females. Access at the primary level is also comparatively&#13;
good, although enrollment of girls still lags behind that of boys. As of 1994-95, there were 231,851&#13;
boys and 191,210 girls enrolled at the primary level, corresponding to approximately 101 percent and&#13;
87 percent of the school-age populations."2 At the middle level, 74,715 boys and 42,203 girls were&#13;
9 The Northern Areas is the only region, in fact, in which girls scored lower than boys, reflecting the&#13;
serious gender equity issues in the region.&#13;
10 1994 data. This breakdown of enrollments does not include information on private providers other than&#13;
AKESP.&#13;
11 Note that while the majority of these appear to be new enrollments, there clearly has also been some&#13;
shifting in enrolLment between government, AKESP, and community schools. 1994 was therefore chosen as a&#13;
more reliable base year for statistical monitoring purposes.&#13;
12 Note that AJK has a significant number of "under-age" children enrolled at the primary level, so actual&#13;
coverage rates are undoubtedly lower.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
enrolled, corresponding to approximately 75 percent and 44 percent of the corresponding school age&#13;
populations. Participation rates appear to be fairly even across districts at the primary level, although&#13;
there are important differences at the middle level particularly for females.&#13;
1.9        AJK's relatively good record on access is the direct result of the AJK Government's&#13;
decision to give high priority to the expansion of educational services over the past two decades. The&#13;
Government is overwhelmingly the largest provider of educational services, and is directly responsible&#13;
for 5,669 schools (primary through high school), about 97 percent of primary enrollments, 87 percent&#13;
of middle school enrollments, and 87 percent of high school enrollments. A small but growing&#13;
private sector accounts for the remaining enrollments, and approximately 306 schools.'3 Most of the&#13;
private schools are located in urban areas, and cater to the demands of high and middle-income&#13;
families. Most are also coeducational, although boys enrollments greatly outstrip those of girls,&#13;
which may be a reflection of families' priorities in the face of relatively high fees (the average fee is&#13;
estimated to be about Rs.200 per month).&#13;
1.10       Despite AJK's achievements with regard to access, however, learning levels appear to be&#13;
at or below national averages. In the recent MSU sponsored survey of student achievement among&#13;
class five students and teachers, girls in AJK scored 52 percent and boys 48 percent, compared to&#13;
national averages of 62 percent and 59 percent.&#13;
D. Education Finance&#13;
1.11       Government spending on education has been extremely low in the NA and AJK. Low&#13;
historical spending in the NA has resulted in low literacy levels, poor education assets and low&#13;
student completion and achievement. The education sector expenditures in NA and AJK represent a&#13;
small part of the total Federal (GOP) expenditures -- only about one percent in 1995-96. Both areas,&#13;
however, rely very heavily on GOP transfers for financing their expenditures. All funding for the&#13;
NA -- both development and non-development, is allocated through the KANAISAFRON Ministry.&#13;
The AJK government internally generated resources cover only 35 percent of its overall expenditures&#13;
while GOP finances the other 65 percent. In 1995-96, allocations to education amounted to about 20&#13;
and 24 percent of total public sector allocations in NA and AJK respectively (development and non-&#13;
development).&#13;
1.12       During the past five years, education development expenditures have declined in AJK.&#13;
Education Development Expenditures as a share of the Annual Development Plan (ADP) averaged&#13;
14.0 percent in 1991-92 and are estimated at 8.4 percent in 1995-96. In the NA, elementary&#13;
education has received some support through the SAP budget. However, these funds represent&#13;
extremely small and insufficient amounts when compared with the sector's acute needs. Recurrent&#13;
spending on the elementary level has lagged behind with net gains going to the secondary and higher&#13;
levels. Elementary Non-development (recurrent) Expenditures increased at an average annual rate of&#13;
14.2 percent in the NA, while Secondary (and College) Non-Development Expenditures grew at an&#13;
annual average rate of 16.7 percent. In AJK, Elementary Non-Development Expenditures increased&#13;
at an average rate of 8.6 percent, while College Non-Development Expenditures grew at an average&#13;
annual rate of 14.1 percent (for additional information on education finance, see Annex 2).&#13;
13 Enrollment percentages are based on data from the private schools association in Muzaffarabad and are&#13;
rough estimates only.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.13       One of the most critical problems in the education recurrent expenditures is the&#13;
dominance of the salary component. In AJK there are virtually no budgetary provisions for non-&#13;
salary inputs, such as repairs, maintenance, instructional materials, and so on. Recently, a provision&#13;
of equipment (furniture, sports goods) amounting to Rs.35 million for 4,119 primary schools was&#13;
included in the ADP. One of the reasons for the high proportion of dangerous schools is the&#13;
combined effect of poor quality construction and inadequate allocation of funds for maintenance and&#13;
repairs. In the NA, non-salary inputs in the elementary education non-development expenditures have&#13;
increased; while they represented on average 4.5 percent of elementary expenditures over the past five&#13;
years, non-salary inputs totalled approximately 12.0 percent of the elementary non-development&#13;
allocations in 1995-96. This level of non-salary allocations needs to be sustained.&#13;
1.14       According to the best available estimates of parental expenditures on education, the&#13;
parents of children in government-run primary schools spend approximately Rs.500-600 yearly on&#13;
items including school books, uniforms, supplies and a nominal monthly school fee (Rs.5). Students&#13;
in AKESP schools pay an additional fee of Rs.50 per month. AKESP fees are kept low in large part&#13;
through subsidization of the Aga Khan Foundation, and their schools also offer fee remission for low-&#13;
income students. Independent private schools rely solely on tuition for operating expenses and their&#13;
fees tend to be quite high (Rs.200 per month or more).&#13;
E. Main Sector Issues&#13;
1.15       The major issues confronting the elementary education sub-sector in the NA and AJK&#13;
include: (a) low quality of education and poor student achievement due to a combination of untrained&#13;
or poorly trained teachers, limited and/or inappropriate instructional materials and harsh physical&#13;
conditions; (b) limited access, particularly for girls; (c) low management capacity due to a lack of&#13;
reliable information, a shortage of trained and technical staff, and political constraints; and (d) limited&#13;
system accountability to parents and/or experience in mobilizing parents and community members in&#13;
support of education.&#13;
School Quality Issues&#13;
1.16       Physical Conditions of Schools. Inadequate design and lack of maintenance funds have&#13;
led to very poor physical conditions in the great majority of schools in both AJK and the NA. In&#13;
AJK, out of a total of 5,228 Government schools, 661 have serious structural deficiencies rendering&#13;
them dangerous to children, and 1,126 are classified as "shelterless" -- either managing in a rented or&#13;
donated building not suited for the purpose or without any shelter whatsoever. In the NA, 267 out&#13;
of 691 Government primary and middle schools are in need of interventions ranging from minor&#13;
repair work to reconstruction of existing buildings and construction of facilities for schools with no&#13;
facilities at all. In both AJK and the NA, most of the older Government schools have insufficient&#13;
classroom space. Newer schools have been built following a standard design that does not allow for&#13;
climatic differences between regions. Many schools have broken furniture, or no furniture at all,&#13;
forcing students to squat on the floor. Very few schools have running water or sanitation, a factor&#13;
that has elsewhere been found to be important in the retention of girls.&#13;
1.17       Teachers and Teaching Practices. Teachers in both the NA and AJK work in&#13;
extraordinarily difficult conditions. In addition to the poor physical conditions of schools, the vast&#13;
majority of teachers in both regions must singlehandedly cope with students spanning several grades&#13;
and age groups in one classroom, without materials other than a textbook. They must teach a range&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
of subjects in Urdu (not their native language, nor that of their students), and are supposed to be able&#13;
to teach Arabic and more recently English as well. Many have had little academic training, and/or no&#13;
formal teacher training, and for those that have, the standard teacher training often proves irrelevant&#13;
to the realities of their teaching situation. For the majority of teachers, supervision or other academic&#13;
support is infrequent, or non-existent. The result is that teachers' content knowledge and classroom&#13;
management skills are generally poor. Often the lower grades are ignored or put under the charge of&#13;
an older student -- a practice that may exacerbate early dropout.&#13;
1.18        There are currently 1,547 teachers teaching in Government-run primary and middle&#13;
schools in the NA, the vast majority ef whom (86 percent) are male.'4 Many lack teaching&#13;
credentials appropriate to the level at which they teach. Only 44 percent of primary teachers in the&#13;
Government system hold the Primary Teaching Certificate (PTC), while 11 percent of primary and 36&#13;
percent of intermediate teachers have not attained the requisite levels of academic education, which&#13;
are "matriculation" following grade 10 for primary teachers and senior secondary completion (grade&#13;
12) or its equivalent for middle school teachers."5 In view of the evidence that parents are often&#13;
more willing to send girls to primary schools where the teacher is female, the predominance of male&#13;
teachers is a problem. The NA administration has been actively promoting the hiring of female&#13;
teachers for community schools through the SAP program: about 50 percent of teachers hired under&#13;
the program thus far are female. In a number of cases, however, the Directorate of Education has&#13;
had to relax academic and training standards for community school appointments -- very few&#13;
community school teachers have had any formal teacher training.&#13;
1.19        Three main factors mitigate against increasing the educational and training levels of&#13;
current and future teachers in the NA: (a) the supply of training places; (b) the scarcity of teachers in&#13;
the system; and (c) for women, constraints on travel as well as access to middle and higher education.&#13;
There is currently one College of Education for men located in Gilgit, while a small female "college"&#13;
operates in a rented building as an unsanctioned branch of the male college without hostel facilities.&#13;
With a theoretical total capacity of around 200 trainees per year, the current college based system&#13;
cannot begin to meet the needs for teacher training. The Directorate of Education and AKESP also&#13;
have collaborated over the last 12 years in running a relatively low-cost and well-regarded Field&#13;
Based Teacher Development (FBTD) program. The FBTD Program is particularly beneficial for&#13;
female teachers, as it obviates the need for dislocation from the family and community, but under the&#13;
current model capacity is also very limited. The small number of teachers in the Government system&#13;
also constrains the utilization of training capacity as with few substitute teachers available, supervisors&#13;
are understandably reluctant to release in-service teachers for a year long training course.'6&#13;
14 An additional 460 posts (primary through high school levels) were sanctioned as of early 1996, but these&#13;
posts have yet to be filled.&#13;
15 Academic preparation may in fact be worse than these statistics suggest, as it is possible to sit for the&#13;
matriculation exam as a "private candidate" without actually having completed grade 10. Given problems with&#13;
the design and security of the matriculation exam, it is possible for candidates with very low levels of content&#13;
knowledge to pass it.&#13;
16 Note that until 1995, no additional teaching posts had been authorized for the NA since 1986, despite an&#13;
overall increase in enrollment and the building of a number of new schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
1.20       In contrast to the NA, the much larger teaching force in AJK is better balanced in terms&#13;
of gender and has higher formal qualifications. Male teachers represent about 61 percent of a total of&#13;
11,451 teachers at the primary level, and 64 percent of a total of 5,596 at the middle level. There&#13;
is, however, an imbalance between males and females with regard to training: 37 percent of female&#13;
teachers in primary schools are untrained, compared with 8 percent of males, while in middle schools&#13;
the percentages of untrained teachers are 22 percent for females and only 12 percent for males. The&#13;
reasons behind this large gap are unclear, although the greater difficulty for female teachers to attend&#13;
lengthy teacher training courses far from home may be part of the explanation.&#13;
1.21       AJK has a very large system of college-based certification training for elementary school&#13;
teachers, at the same time as it has almost no capacity for in-service/refresher training. Ten of&#13;
Pakistan's 90 Government Colleges of Elementary Training are in AJK, with one male and one&#13;
female teacher training college in each of five administrative districts (two more districts have&#13;
recently been established in AJK). The theoretical capacity of these 10 colleges is 1,000-1,500&#13;
graduates (PTC and Certificate of Teaching (CT)) per year, far more than the system can absorb or&#13;
justify on the basis of current student-teacher and gross enrollment ratios. In addition, there are an&#13;
Agro-Technical College (for male primary teachers), a College of Education (for male secondary&#13;
teachers) and the Institute for Teacher Training and Research in the district of Poonch. As in the&#13;
NA, the quality of teacher training in AJK is poor; colleges have few resources beyond staff, and&#13;
courses are geared far more towards passing theoretically-biassed certification exams than towards&#13;
improving content mastery and practical teaching skills. A limited amount of in-service training in&#13;
the form of short "refresher" courses has functioned sporadically through the Education Extension&#13;
Center (EEC) founded in 1981, but the EEC has never had sufficient funds, staff, or expertise to&#13;
develop into an institution capable of planning and coordinating in-service training on a more systemic&#13;
basis.&#13;
1.22       Curriculum and Educational Materials. Like the rest of Pakistan, both AJK and the NA&#13;
follow the broad outlines of the curriculum defined by the Federal Ministry of Education. The&#13;
provinces and regions do have some autonomy, however, in further defining learning competencies&#13;
that are expected to be mastered at each grade level. Neither AJK nor the NA has thus far made an&#13;
attempt to define such competencies, which in turn would serve to guide materials development,&#13;
teacher training programs and assessment activities. In practice, changes in curriculum, teacher&#13;
training, and materials development have been quite disjointed: AJK, for example, recently&#13;
introduced the teaching of English as a compulsory subject from grade 1 despite the fact that the vast&#13;
majority of primary school teachers in the system have no training in English as a Second language&#13;
(ESL) or language teaching in general. Both AJK and the NA participated in a UNICEF-funded&#13;
national program which promoted an integrated curriculum and local textbook development for grades&#13;
one to three. The books developed under this program are now in use in AJK and one district of the&#13;
NA, although there has been little reliable evaluation of their impact and very little training of&#13;
teachers in their use. UNICEF funding for the project ended in 1993.&#13;
1.23       From a practical standpoint, the textbooks used in the classroom in effect become the&#13;
curriculum. Parents are responsible for purchasing textbooks, and distribution of textbooks is done in&#13;
both the NA and AJK by private distributors. This system appears to be working well. Separate&#13;
teaching guides have been developed in the NA through the joint Government/AKESP FBTD&#13;
Program and by the Government in AJK for the new integrated textbooks, but few teachers appear to&#13;
have them or be using them. The Northern Areas FBTD Program does train teachers to develop low-&#13;
cost materials themselves, but this area of training is very underemphasized in the college-based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
training in both regions. Prior to the development of the integrated textbooks (for grades 1-3 in AJK&#13;
and grades 1-2 in the NA) both regions used the textbooks developed by the Punjab Textbook Board&#13;
for all grades. These textbooks continue to be used in most of the NA, and from grade 3 on in AJK.&#13;
The books are not designed to support specific local minimum competency levels, and most contain&#13;
cultural and other references alien to Northern Pakistan which in some instances may make them less&#13;
effective as teaching/learning tools. Nor are materials (textbooks or others) incorporating multigrade&#13;
teaching techniques available in either the NA or AJK.&#13;
1.24       Assessment of Student Learning. There are currently four main types of assessment in&#13;
AJK and the NA: (a) examinations that determine grade-wise promotion; (b) middle and high school&#13;
entrance exams (largely in AJK); (c) PTC and CT certification examinations; and (d) classroom-based&#13;
diagnostic assessment. No institutionalized form of achievement testing currently exists in either the&#13;
NA or AJK, or, indeed, Pakistan at large. With regard to promotion, both areas rely largely on&#13;
single, year-end examinations to determine students' success or failure in each grade of elementary&#13;
school. The grade 10 exam (matric) is set nationally; all others are set locally. This "pass/fail"&#13;
system of examinations is not only unfair to students, but it provides no diagnostic feedback to&#13;
teachers. Effective teaching requires not only that students are given more opportunities to prove&#13;
themselves, but also that teachers learn and use skills for continuous assessment which provides&#13;
feedback on their own effectiveness. Most diagnostic assessment currently is teacher-dependent and&#13;
appears to consist of informal checks on students and practice in the prevailing end-of-the-year exam&#13;
style with a great deal of emphasis on memorization. The teacher training curriculum includes a unit&#13;
on examinations, but teacher educators consider it inadequate preparation for the purpose. All types&#13;
of high-stakes exams are characterized by serious questions about their validity, reliability and&#13;
security.&#13;
1.25       With regard to teacher certification exams, both AIK and the NA hold local authority for&#13;
constructing and administering the PTC and CT examinations. In the NA, the exams are set by the&#13;
College of Education, while in AJK, the exam setting authority has recently been moved from the&#13;
colleges of education to the Examinations Board, in part to counteract abuses. Pass rates for exams&#13;
are very high, and at least in the NA are considered "too theoretical," giving much higher weight to&#13;
academic than to practical knowledge. Effective transformation of teacher training will necessitate&#13;
revision of the certification exams to reflect the new principles on which teacher training is based.&#13;
Access, Equity and Efficiency&#13;
1.26       Access. Access is clearly a major problem in the NA. Extreme topography and&#13;
weather as well as transport problems make it difficult for children to travel even relatively short&#13;
distances from home to school. The very low participation rates also appear to reflect more of a&#13;
supply than a demand constraint. Whereas AJK is permitted to, and did appoint, new teachers (many&#13;
have gone to teach in shelterless schools), in the NA no new teachers were appointed from 1986-&#13;
1995. In the NA, with agriculture no longer able to sustain a growing population and the Karakoram&#13;
Highway beginning to open up other economic opportunities, the demand for education is growing.&#13;
In a recent AKRSP survey of communities' investment priorities, education consistently appeared at&#13;
or near the top of the list, and pressure to upgrade existing primary schools to middle level has been&#13;
intense. The Government's recent experience with the applications for funding of community schools&#13;
has also served to dispel a number of myths regarding parents' willingness to educate girls: even in&#13;
some of the most traditional areas (Diamer district, for example), communities have come forward&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
with requests to establish primary schools for girls, and there is increased willingness elsewhere to&#13;
permit co-education at the primary level, particularly if the teacher is female.&#13;
1.27       Although less dramatic a problem than in the NA, access is also still a problem in AJK,&#13;
particularly for girls. Fewer girls than boys enroll in Katchi (kindergarten) class. While it is possible&#13;
that lower levels of enrollment for girls may reflect a parental preference for educating boys,&#13;
particularly among the very poor, it is likely that these statistics also reflect the smaller number of&#13;
girls' schools at the primary level. There are also fewer girls' schools than boys schools at the&#13;
middle and high school levels, and student/teacher ratios for girls' primary schools are also higher&#13;
than those of boys' schools (42:3 versus 33:5).&#13;
1.28       Equity. The main equity issue in both the NA and AJK is that of gender, and the&#13;
discrepancies between male and female participation rates, as well as teachers. Particularly in the&#13;
NA, however, there are also problems of equity between districts. The long-term presence of AKESP&#13;
in Gilgit and Ghizer districts, for example, has offered opportunities for girls' schooling which have&#13;
been lacking in other districts. There are also inequities in both AJK and the NA in the distribution&#13;
of education resources between urban and rural areas. Urban schools tend to be better supplied and&#13;
staffed than their rural counterparts.&#13;
1.29       Efficiency. Both the NA and AJK educational systems have a certain amount of "built-&#13;
in" inefficiency through the existence of very small schools (less than 20 students) in some of the&#13;
rural areas (such schools make up about six percent of schools in the NA). In theory, inequity as&#13;
well as inefficiency could be alleviated by having girls and boys within the same village attend the&#13;
same school, instead of separate boys and girls' schools. In practice, however, the successful&#13;
implementation of such a policy depends upon prevailing cultural norms. In the NA, for example,&#13;
co-education at the primary level is increasingly accepted in most districts, particularly if the teacher&#13;
is female. The Directorate of Education in the NA has been encouraging co-education at the primary&#13;
level, although it has permitted communities to open separate girls schools where the idea is still&#13;
unacceptable. In AJK, separate schooling has been the norm, although there is some willingness to&#13;
consider mixed schooling at the primary level in the future.&#13;
1.30       The internal efficiency of the educational system also appears to be low. Although&#13;
neither the NA or AJK collect systematic data on repetition and dropout, rough estimates indicate that&#13;
in AJK at least, there is a bottleneck in the transition from Katchi class to grade 1. Steady dropout&#13;
and/or repetition continues through primary school at an average of about seven percent of the student&#13;
population in subsequent grades. In the NA, the estimated percentage of dropout/repetition per grade&#13;
is lower on average for boys (five percent) but much higher for girls (about 11 percent). A second&#13;
important bottleneck in both the NA and AJK appears in the transition of girls from grade 5 (primary)&#13;
to grade 6 (middle). This second bottleneck reflects either parental unwillingness to send daughters&#13;
longer distances to middle schools or the simple lack of availability of middle schools for girls, as&#13;
well as cultural (early marriage) and economic (the relative tradeoffs between education and home&#13;
labor) factors.&#13;
Institutional and Managerial Issues&#13;
1.31        Lack of Information for Planning. Educational planning in both AJK and the NA suffers&#13;
from deficiencies common in much of the rest of the country. Decisions are often made in the&#13;
absence of relevant information or analysis either because: (a) the information is not available at all,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
or not available in an accessible format; and/or (b) the decision maker does not have sufficient&#13;
training to comfortably use the information that is available, or request additional information when&#13;
needed; and/or (c) even if the relevant information were clear and available, other pressures&#13;
(including political ones) take precedence. As in many places, education system information also&#13;
often moves in a single direction from the school to the central level, with collection done because it&#13;
is required and not because it is useful. With little or no feedback and few incentives for accurate&#13;
data collection the quality of the data collected is poor.&#13;
1.32       Under the general guidance of the Federal Academy for Educational Planning and&#13;
Management, both the NA and AJK have installed fledgling Education Management Information&#13;
Systems (EMIS). In the NA, this consists of a central unit of three people that is so ill-equipped and&#13;
ill-trained that it is essentially non-functional.'7 In AJK, things have progressed a bit further. The&#13;
central unit has managed to construct a data base covering a selection of basic education statistics for&#13;
the past three years, and data entry has been done at the district, as well as the central level. The&#13;
data being collected, however, is exclusively that mandated by the federal Government and does not&#13;
include additional information useful to the running of AJK's own system. Nor has any of the data&#13;
collected in AJK been thus far verified for accuracy.&#13;
1.33       Both AJK and the NA also lack some crucial baseline data. Neither village-level&#13;
population estimates nor inter-school distance coordinates are available, making it enormously difficult&#13;
to ensure adequate site selection for the building or expansion of schools. Neither AJK nor the NA&#13;
collect data on repetition and dropout rates, and there is no information available on student&#13;
achievement other than the recent results of a general test (not geared specifically to AJK or the NA)&#13;
sponsored as part of SAP monitoring activities.&#13;
1.34       Shortage of Technical and Female Staff. Although their overall staffing situations are&#13;
quite different, both the NA and AJK lack expertise and trained staff in a number of important areas.&#13;
T'hese include educational planning, curriculum and materials development, student assessment&#13;
techniques, computer systems and programming, and school construction. In the NA in particular,&#13;
most technical functions have been carried out at the central level by one or two staff, with help&#13;
provided by staff seconded most often from high schools. Projects such as the development of the&#13;
integrated textbooks for grades 1 and 2 have been done through volunteer committees. The advantage&#13;
to this model is diminished bureaucracy and a willingness to work with whomever is interested and&#13;
willing; the disadvantage is lack of continuity and an inevitable lack of specialization. Even in AJK&#13;
where the educational system is much larger and more established, the Curriculum Research&#13;
Development Center (CRDC) which does materials development is a two-person operation, and the&#13;
Department of Education has had trouble filling positions and keeping system analysts and&#13;
programmers for the EMIS cell.&#13;
1.35       With regard to female administrative staff, AJK and the NA stand far apart. AJK does&#13;
have a cadre of female administrators, although there are far fewer than their male counterparts.&#13;
There are very few women in direct supervisory positions, which means that most girls schools and&#13;
female teachers are supervised by men. The NA, in contrast, currently have no female staff&#13;
17 The Federal Education Management Information System (FEDEMIS)'s own collection of data in the NA&#13;
has also been badly flawed in recent years. The 1994 round of data collection, for example, was done in&#13;
January when schools were closed and many villages inaccessible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
employed in administrative or supervisory positions other than the headmistress of the female College&#13;
of Education.&#13;
1.36       Inadequate Supervision. Academic supervision of schools is hampered by a combination&#13;
of the long distances between schools, difficult transport conditions, a high ratio of schools to&#13;
supervisory staff at the district level, and a culture in which supervision is viewed as more of an&#13;
inspection than a guidance function. Most schools are visited a maximum of twice a year, often for&#13;
no more than two hours at a time. These visits are for the most part a formality in which educational&#13;
issues are very seldom discussed, or are occasionally made in order to inquire into a complaint.&#13;
Institutional incentive structures are also such that supervisors are for the most part former high&#13;
school teachers, many of whom may never have taught at the primary level or have not done so in&#13;
many years.&#13;
1.37       Inefficient Allocation of Resources. Inefficient allocation of resources is a far greater&#13;
problem in AJK than in the NA, doubtless in part because the educational system in the NA has&#13;
historically been so resource-poor. Many of the problems identified center on the issue of staffing.&#13;
For example, although AJK has a reasonably good overall student/teacher ratio at the primary level,&#13;
many schools, particularly in the rural areas, have overcrowded classrooms with a single teacher&#13;
while urban schools tend to have a much more favorable student/teacher ratio. This is largely a&#13;
problem of the distribution of the teaching staff, and the difficulties accompanying the transfer of&#13;
teachers to far-flung areas where they face additional difficulties in housing and transport. Political&#13;
connections have often been viewed as outweighing professional qualifications in the appointment of&#13;
teachers. Another major area of waste is in teacher training. As mentioned earlier, there is fairly&#13;
clear evidence that AJK has a surfeit of trained teachers and overcapacity in the teacher training&#13;
colleges. In a major recruitment of primary teachers in 1988, 25,000 people applied for 1,500 posts.&#13;
Of these, about 10 percent, or 2,500 already held teaching credentials.&#13;
1.38       Recently, the AJK Government has taken some important steps towards improving&#13;
efficiency in resource allocation. In the hiring of 500 new teachers in late 1995, for example, the&#13;
Government committed itself to hiring new teachers on the basis of merit (with academic and&#13;
professional qualifications carrying specific weight in a point system). This action has received&#13;
widespread commendation. The Government has also begun a slow phase out of Government-&#13;
subsidization of upgrading of professional credentials, and has taken preliminary steps to reassign a&#13;
surfeit of posts for "teachers in training" in the teacher training colleges back into the elementary&#13;
schools.&#13;
Community Participation and Links with NGOs&#13;
1.39       The NA and AJK differ markedly in regard to levels of community organization and&#13;
experience with NGO/Government cooperation. In the NA, AKESP and the Directorate of Education&#13;
have traditionally shared information and coordinated activities and investments in the Gilgit and&#13;
Ghizer districts, particularly in regard to teacher training. Implementation of the SAP program in the&#13;
NA is also characterized by a high degree of cooperation between the Government and the Aga Khan&#13;
Development Network (AKDN) (consisting of four organizations dedicated to health, education,&#13;
community organizing, and housing). AKRSP has a 15-year history of community organizing&#13;
through the establishment of village organizations (VOs) in all five districts, and was instrumental in&#13;
the design the community schools model. This program is currently one of the most interesting and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
ambitious models for community-Government partnership in education in Pakistan (see also Annex 3&#13;
on Community Participation and NGOs in the NA and AJK).&#13;
1.40       In AJK, in contrast, the NGO sector is far less developed, consisting for the most part&#13;
of small "welfare organizations" working on issues ranging from promoting activities for youth to&#13;
some health and literacy work. With the possible exception of health, there has been little experience&#13;
of cooperation between NGOs and Government agencies. While communities in AJK have supported&#13;
education for their children in a variety of ways (including the donation of buildings to "shelterless"&#13;
schools), such support has usually been provided on an ad-hoc basis, and there are currently no&#13;
formal mechanisms for direct parental and community input into schooling issues.&#13;
F. Government and Donor Strategies in Basic Education&#13;
1.41       The two central problems with Pakistan's education system as a whole are the low&#13;
proportion of girls in school and the poor quality of basic education as reflected in the widespread&#13;
low achievements of children who do go to primary school. Government and donor spending on&#13;
education has thus far managed to expand education facilities, but has been less successful in&#13;
improving quality. The current challenge facing both the government and donors is how to make a&#13;
substantial change in education quality, while at the same time maintaining progress towards universal&#13;
elementary education. IDA's own operational strategy in education has moved from discrete, input-&#13;
oriented projects towards an increased emphasis on policy reform, institutional development,&#13;
management, and governance issues, measures to expand the numbers of girls in school, and finding&#13;
means to expand public sector support for communities and NGOs. The federal Government's main&#13;
funding and policy instrument for basic education is currently the Social Action Program, or SAP.&#13;
The SAP has evolved into a framework for action to improve the planning, programming, budgeting&#13;
and implementation of all on-going and new programs and projects in the social sectors, with an&#13;
emphasis on the integration of donor inputs. The SAP is supported by IDA and other donors through&#13;
an umbrella policy-based Social Action Program Project (SAPP) for FY94/96 to cover basic services&#13;
in health, education, population, and water and sanitation.'8 SAPP concentrates on the major issues&#13;
of program design, implementation and particularly recurrent cost funding that cut across the social&#13;
sectors. In education, SAPP has generally bolstered recurrent and development spending on primary&#13;
education, and has provided leverage on a number of general policy issues, such as increases in&#13;
educational coverage for girls and improvements in educational monitoring systems. SAPP retains&#13;
essentially a national and macro focus, however, and is not, as a single instrument, well suited to&#13;
supporting provincial or area-specific initiatives and reforms. To complement SAPP, the Government&#13;
and donors (including IDA) are also supporting provincial-level education projects in all four of&#13;
Pakistan's provinces.&#13;
1.42       At the level of the NA and AJK Governments, proposals to address the education sector&#13;
issues outlined above are contained in statements of educational priorities and strategies developed by&#13;
each administration during project preparation (see Annexes 4 and 5). These statements are a first&#13;
attempt to articulate regional priorities within the education sector and broadly reflect discussions held&#13;
between policy makers, a wide range of Department and Directorate of Education (DOE) staff,&#13;
teachers, NGOs, and other stakeholders during project preparation workshops held in each region.&#13;
18 Pakistan Social Action Program Project, Credit No. 2593-PAK, approved in March 1994. A follow-on&#13;
project, SAPP II, is currently being prepared.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Details of the policy agenda vary somewhat between the two regions (given the different stages of&#13;
development of the educational systems), but key aspects of each include, for the NA: (a) continued&#13;
priority given to expanding access for girls, and to the preparation and hiring of female staff; (b)&#13;
efforts to improve the quality of existing schools through staff training and infrastructure&#13;
improvements; and (c) strengthening existing partnerships with communities and NGOs. In AJK, key&#13;
aspects include: (a) prioritization of quality improvements at the elementary level; (b) progress in&#13;
rationalization of staff hiring, deployment, and training policies; and (c) efforts to promote increased&#13;
community participation in education. An important element to both regions' strategies would be&#13;
commitment to increase non-salary recurrent expenditures.&#13;
G. IDA Strategy and Rationale for Project Investment&#13;
1.43       Northern Pakistan is an area where the needs are great, but which has received little&#13;
donor attention in the past. The project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
discussed by the Board on December 19, 1995, and reviewed on April 19, 1997, particularly in its&#13;
emphasis on improving conditions for rural women and girls. As occurs in the other Provinces, the&#13;
proposed project would also help complement, support, and inform the work of SAPP. Because AJK&#13;
and the NA are still technically considered "disputed areas," many donors are not permitted by their&#13;
own rules to consider investments there. IDA funding can therefore help fill a void. Through work&#13;
in support of elementary education in the four Provinces of Pakistan, IDA is also in a relatively&#13;
strong position to ensure that lessons (both positive and negative) learned in other projects are made&#13;
available to the NA and AJK.  Finally, both AJK and the NA are at stages in the development of&#13;
their educational systems where IDA support could make a significant difference: in AJK,&#13;
consolidating already impressive advances in access with improvements in system quality, equity, and&#13;
management; and in the NA, supporting an innovative effort to expand educational access in&#13;
cooperation with the community and NGOs.&#13;
H. Lessons from Experience&#13;
1.44       The main lessons from sector work in education and project experience in Pakistan as&#13;
well as other countries have been incorporated into the project. These lessons are outlined below:&#13;
1.45       Regional Focus. Past projects involving a Federal Coordinating Unit and multiple&#13;
provinces (such as Primary Education II), have experienced serious implementation delays, largely&#13;
due to the adding of bureaucratic layers whereas the provinces are legislatively and financially&#13;
responsible for elementary education. Although the federal Government does have a more direct role&#13;
in the NA than in AJK or other provinces, the project attempts to reduce bureaucratic delays by&#13;
making regional agencies responsible for implementation and avoiding the creation of a separate,&#13;
federal level coordinating unit. As with all other projects, federal ministries would, however, be kept&#13;
informed of project progress (principally the Ministry of Education and the KANA/SAFRON&#13;
Ministry).&#13;
1.46       Education of Girls. Several studies and surveys in Pakistan have confirmed the&#13;
beneficial impact of female education on the total fertility rate, infant and child mortality, child&#13;
immunization rates, nutritional status and children's school attendance.&#13;
1.47       Program Management. Experience under several projects has shown that project&#13;
management structures established outside the normal administrative hierarchy of provincial or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
regional Departments of Education fail to institutionalize gains into the regular system. The project&#13;
has therefore opted against the setting-up of a specialized Project Implementation Unit (PIU), and has&#13;
adopted a more programmatic approach to minimize the burdens of "special" project monitoring.&#13;
1.48       Technical Assistance. A strong technical assistance package has proven to be a crucial&#13;
factor in the relatively good implementation progress of several recent projects (notably the&#13;
Balochistan Primary Education Project), particularly where the choice has been made to strengthen the&#13;
existing system rather than establish a project implementation unit (PIU). The project will support&#13;
both short and longer-term TA packages in both the NA and AJK.&#13;
1.49       Annual Reviews. Annual reviews have become a tool for successful planning and&#13;
implementation reviews under both the SAPP and other social sector projects. The annual review sets&#13;
realistic targets for the following year based on implementation records of the past year. In other&#13;
projects, rigid adherence to PC-1 targets established at project appraisal have become a major&#13;
constraint to implementation; these targets are often outdated, and do not reflect the changing realities&#13;
or needs that may arise over time. Annual reviews under the proposed project would also permit&#13;
coordination with future SAP reviews.&#13;
1.50       School Site Selection. One of the most intractable problems in school construction is the&#13;
selection and approval of sites. School mapping exercises and use of EMIS systems to verify school-&#13;
site selection criteria has begun to improve the situation in several recent projects, away from the&#13;
interference of politics. Agreement by both the NA and AJK Governments to conduct a school&#13;
mapping exercise and use the resulting information as the basis for school site selection is an&#13;
important aspect of the proposed project.&#13;
1.51       Community Participation. Both international research in education and recent sector&#13;
work in Pakistan have shown that community participation in school management can have a positive&#13;
effect on learning outcomes as well as on project sustainability. The proposed project incorporates&#13;
substantial community participation in the NA, and in AJK supports a pilot experiment to promote&#13;
community participation.&#13;
1.52       Teacher Training and Materials Provision. Research in Pakistan has shown that&#13;
certification of teachers appears to make little difference with regard to students' achievement levels,&#13;
while higher academic attainment of teachers contributes positively to learning achievement. Clearly&#13;
these results are in part a reflection of the very poor quality of teacher training. While the proposed&#13;
project does support certification (which is important to teachers), it also attempts to influence teacher&#13;
training content and methodologies to bolster basic skills (including academic). With regard to&#13;
materials provision, the main emphasis in this project would be on improving the teaching tool&#13;
teachers are most familiar with -- the textbook.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Approach and Objectives&#13;
2.1        As with other recent IDA-funded social sector projects in Pakistan, the proposed project&#13;
would follow a "program approach." This approach requires an agreement between the Government,&#13;
IDA, and any other donors on the overall sector policies and strategies, including directions for&#13;
reform, during the life of the project."9 In both the NA and AJK, the agreed program would&#13;
comprise the full range of activities in the elementary education sector, complementing the increased&#13;
community and NGO involvement in the provision and improvement of elementary schooling.&#13;
Program activities, implementation plans, monitoring indicators and budget requirements for both the&#13;
NA and AJK are consistent with the regional statements of educational priorities and strategies, and&#13;
have been discussed between the regional Governments, federal Government, and IDA. The&#13;
proposed project would support all incremental activities in the elementary sector, on a time-slice&#13;
basis. The proposed project would operate under the umbrella of the national SAP, with the detailed&#13;
project work in each region contributing to the development of broad SAP annual plans. SAP&#13;
conditionality, financing and disbursements would be complementary to those for the project.&#13;
Satisfactory progress on the FY1997-98 SAP operational plan was a condition of Board Presentation&#13;
which was fulfilled at Negotiations (para. 5.2(p)).&#13;
2.2        Project support would be linked to satisfactory implementation of the agreed program&#13;
and annual operational plans and targets tied to annual reviews. Each year, progress made during the&#13;
previous year would be reviewed, and the education sector program for the coming financial year (in&#13;
terms of budget requirements, reform measures to be implemented, and schedule of activities) will be&#13;
defined in detail. IDA would need to have seen adequate progress during the previous year, ensure&#13;
compliance with any overarching SAP agreements and approve each annual plan before releasing&#13;
project funds for that year. With this approach, the Governments should have more flexibility in&#13;
implementing the program than through a more traditional project approach, but they will be&#13;
responsible for meeting performance targets in order to receive annual funding. Agreement that: (a)&#13;
annual sub-programs would be prepared and agreed with IDA, covering both Government and non-&#13;
government inputs, activities, policy reforms and financial commitments; and (b) any major proposed&#13;
change to the approved program would be agreed in advance with IDA was reached at Negotiations&#13;
(para. 5.2(b)). IDA approval of each sub-program will be a condition of disbursement for the project&#13;
in both the NA and AJK (para. 5.3(b)).&#13;
2.3        The proposed Northern Education Project (NEP) would cover education from Katchi to&#13;
grade 8, with emphasis on the primary years and on girls' education. The project's objectives are:&#13;
(a) to improve the quality of education, increase learning achievement and improve completion rates&#13;
in elementary education; (b) to increase access, equity, and retention of students, particularly girls; (c)&#13;
to strengthen institutional capacity to plan and manage educational programs; and (d) to encourage&#13;
greater community and NGO participation. Operational indicators to be used to track progress on&#13;
19 The British Department for International Development (DFID - formerly ODA) has proposed to finance&#13;
selected program activities in the NA as part of the Northern Education Project (NEP). Please see Chapter III&#13;
of this report for additional details.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
these objectives are presented in Annex 6. The project's overall objectives are the same for both the&#13;
NA and AJK, although the project would place more or less emphasis on the different objectives&#13;
according to local circumstances and the priorities set forth in the statements of educational priorities&#13;
and strategies for each region. Prior to Negotiations, final and formally approved copies of the&#13;
statements of educational priorities and strategies dated August, 1996 were provided to IDA (para.&#13;
5.1 (a)), and adherence to these statements was confirmed during Negotiations (para. 5.2(a)).&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
2.4         The project would consist of four main components: (a) Improving Education Quality&#13;
(US$8.2 million equivalent; 25 percent of base costs); (b) Increasing Equitable Access (US$16.3&#13;
million equivalent; 50 percent of base costs); (c) Strengthening Institutional Capacity (US$4.4 million&#13;
equivalent; 13 percent of base costs); and (d) Community Participation (US$3.8 million equivalent; 12&#13;
percent of base costs).&#13;
Improving Education Quality&#13;
2.5         This component would support policy changes, strategies and activities designed to&#13;
improve educational quality, including: (a) changes in teacher recruitment and training; (b)&#13;
curriculum and educational materials development; and (c) the development of assessment capacity.&#13;
While described separately, these three subcomponents are all interrelated and interdependent.&#13;
(a) Teacher Training&#13;
2.6        Teacher training initiatives would differ for the NA and AJK, reflecting the areas'&#13;
different needs. In the NA, the priority strategies would focus on meeting the basic training and&#13;
certification needs of brand new teachers and a tremendous backlog of untrained teachers as well as&#13;
longer term investments to expand the potential pool of teachers, particularly women. In AJK, the&#13;
project would emphasize updating the skills and content knowledge of teachers already in the&#13;
classroom through the establishment of an in-service (INSET) training capacity.&#13;
2.7        In the NA, the project would support an expansion of the joint Government-AKESP&#13;
FBTD program as well as college-based training. The FBTD program is a ten-year-old, intensive,&#13;
practicum based program for increasing teachers' content knowledge and broadening their base of&#13;
pedagogical skills. The fundamental aim is to improve teaching, rather than to award credentials.&#13;
Many uncertified teachers, however, have attained their teaching credentials as "private candidates"&#13;
for certification exams, following the completion of FBTD. Under the project approximately 2,140&#13;
Government and community school teachers would be trained under the FBTD program, through a&#13;
combination of AKESP and Government-run centers.&#13;
2.8        With regard to expanding professional, academic and training opportunities for women&#13;
in the NA, the project would support the construction, equipping, and staffing of two female&#13;
elementary colleges of education, one in Gilgit, and one in Skardu, as well as existing non-formal and&#13;
distance education strategies. The colleges would have a combined capacity of approximately 150&#13;
students and would have hostel facilities. They would be expected to be fully operational by the&#13;
1999/2000 academic year. Approximately 1,600 teachers would be expected to be trained by the new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
and existing colleges of education over the life of the project.20 Given the acute shortage of girls'&#13;
secondary schools in the NA, the project would also support an existing low-cost strategy for&#13;
improving academic levels for girls through the distance education program developed by Allamna&#13;
Iqbal Open University (AIOU). The AIOU program provides self-study materials for middle and&#13;
high school students through local centers.&#13;
2.9         As a corollary to efforts to improve the availability of female teachers, the NA&#13;
Government would also be expected to continue the current policy of promoting the recruitment of&#13;
female teachers at the primary level, both in regular Government and community schools. Under the&#13;
current community schools program, communities must appoint a female teacher if there is a qualified&#13;
female available in the village.&#13;
2.10        In AJK, given the current over-capacity in the college-based teacher training system, the&#13;
project would support policy changes to improve resource allocation and management, as well as the&#13;
establishment of an in-service training capacity. Relevant policy changes would include: (a) efforts&#13;
to give more control to principals of the teacher training colleges with regard to the selection of&#13;
teachers and students; (b) measures to identify and provide training opportunities to remaining&#13;
untrained teachers and a gradual phase-out of Government-paid "on-service" PTC and CT training in&#13;
the teacher training colleges2"; (c) reallocation of "excess" posts away from the teacher training&#13;
colleges back into the regular system; and (d) continued Government commitment to the appointment&#13;
and promotion of teachers on a strictly merit basis.22&#13;
2.11        Recognizing that teachers and educational administrators require recurring opportunities&#13;
to update their knowledge and skills, the project would also support the development of a&#13;
comprehensive and flexible system for short (two-day to two-week) in-service "refresher" courses in&#13;
AJK, under the auspices of the Educational Extension Center (EEC). The first priority of the EEC&#13;
would be to provide two-week courses on teaching the Integrated Curriculum, to all primary school&#13;
teachers. These courses would be offered at the teacher training colleges during summer holidays. In&#13;
accordance with capacity, the EEC would develop and provide specialized courses in English,&#13;
Mathematics, continuous assessment techniques, multigrade teaching strategies, and other identified&#13;
needs of elementary school teachers. The EEC would also provide some training in academic and&#13;
managerial subjects to administrative staff.&#13;
20 The project would also support investments in books, materials and teacher training in the existing male&#13;
College of Education to complement investments made on the female side.&#13;
21 "On-service" training is used to distinquish college-based PTC and CT (pre-service) training is used to&#13;
distinguish college-based PTC and CT (pre-service) training for teachers that already have government teaching&#13;
positions. "In-service" training in this report is selected, usually short-term training offered to already certified&#13;
teachers.&#13;
22 Given the poor quality of pre-service training currently in AJK and the fact that there will be a&#13;
continued need for some pre-service training, there is clearly scope for investments in quality improvements for&#13;
a sub-set of the teacher training colleges (GCETs). Given overall cuts to this project, it was not possible to&#13;
fund such investments. This is an area that could conceivably be supported through SAP financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
(b) Curriculum and Materials Development&#13;
2.12       The project would support similar strategies in both the NA and AJK with regard to&#13;
curriculum and educational materials development, although the choice, phasing and implementation&#13;
of activities would vary in accordance with current institutional capacity. The main thrust of this&#13;
strategy would be to strengthen local capacity for textbook and materials development, in order to&#13;
ensure that elementary education in both regions is conveyed through well-designed and locally&#13;
relevant textbooks, and that a wider variety of learning materials are available and used in&#13;
elementary classrooms. Common components of this strategy would include: (a) development of lists&#13;
of learning competencies by grade-level, which would in turn guide the materials development,&#13;
teacher training, and assessment activities; (b) revision and gradual introduction of existing locally&#13;
developed textbooks; (c) development of textbooks for additional grades (as feasible); (d) development&#13;
of teacher materials with specific purposes, such as support of multigrade materials and/or&#13;
development and use of low-cost teaching aids; and (e) the provision of some supplemental learning&#13;
materials to schools (in conjunction with teacher training efforts).&#13;
2.13       In the NA, where there is limited experience with textbook design, the project would&#13;
support the continuation of activities begun under the UNICEF integrated curriculum project.&#13;
Textbooks developed for grades one and two would be revised, and additional textbooks and&#13;
annotated teachers' guides would be developed for grades three, and as implementation capacity&#13;
permits, grades four and five. In AJK, where there is greater institutional capacity, it is expected that&#13;
textbook development could proceed through grade eight. The Curriculum Research Development&#13;
Center (CRDC) in AJK would also undertake field-based research on teaching/learning practices in&#13;
the elementary schools. In order to facilitate the work of the CRDC and EEC, the project would&#13;
support the construction of a new office building to be shared by both agencies.&#13;
(c) Assessment&#13;
2.14       The overall lack of technical expertise in student assessment calls for investments in&#13;
training and technical assistance in both the NA and AJK. In both areas, there would be two main&#13;
foci to assessment activities: (a) baseline and end-of-project achievement testing; and (b) introduction&#13;
of continuous assessment concepts and practices to teacher trainers and curriculum developers. The&#13;
first activity would form an integral part of program/project monitoring and evaluation. A criterion-&#13;
referenced test of mathematics and Urdu competency would be developed and administered to a&#13;
sample of grade four students at the end of the first program year, and a comparable test would be&#13;
administered in the final year of the program to determine whether measurable improvements in&#13;
student learning have been made during the intervening period. Tests would be based on learning&#13;
competency lists developed for grades one to three. As this form of testing is complex and relatively&#13;
new to Pakistan, technical assistance will be required.&#13;
2.15       The second strategy would be the development of capacity to train and support teachers&#13;
in the use of continuous assessment techniques. This would be done because: (a) this is an area that&#13;
can provide immediate support for improved teaching practice; and (b) as teachers and teacher&#13;
educators become familiar with continuous assessment concepts and techniques, the effects are likely&#13;
to spill over into improved promotional examinations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
Increasing Equitable Access&#13;
2.16       This component would support efforts to improve the quantity, physical quality, and&#13;
gender balance of elementary schools operating in the NA and AJK through: (a) reconstruction of&#13;
dangerous schools and construction of new school buildings for currently shelterless schools; and (b)&#13;
in the NA, participatory construction of buildings for community schools. Reflecting current system&#13;
needs, the relative emphasis on system expansion would be greater in the NA than in AJK.&#13;
Construction strategies would also differ. In the NA, the project proposes a construction strategy&#13;
whereby construction of all school buildings would be done with community participation. This&#13;
strategy has been used successfully by the Aga Khan Housing Board in the Northern Areas for over a&#13;
decade, and is considered viable. Community participation in construction activities is expected to&#13;
lower overall construction cost by about 30 percent. In AJK, which lacks both institutional&#13;
experience and positive models for community participation in construction, a more conventional&#13;
approach is proposed.&#13;
2.17       Overall infrastructure needs have been estimated on the basis of available information&#13;
and sample-based infrastructure surveys undertaken during project preparation. A prior condition to&#13;
investments in infrastructure in either the NA or AJK, however, is the conduct of a school mapping&#13;
exercise. Prior to Negotiations, copies of a signed contract for the first stage of a school mapping&#13;
exercise in each region were provided to IDA (para. 5. l(d)). Once baseline information has been&#13;
established, future planning would be based on a yearly school census conducted as part of ongoing&#13;
system monitoring through the education management information system (EMIS).&#13;
2.18       The project would also support the establishment of a maintenance capacity in each&#13;
school receiving interventions for the improvement of its physical infrastructure. During the life of&#13;
the project, maintenance funds would be provided annually by the Department or Directorate of&#13;
Education for use by the school (through PTAs, school committees, village education committees or&#13;
head teachers). These funds would be expected to be matched either in cash or kind by the local&#13;
committees, which would also bear responsibility for performing or contracting regular maintenance&#13;
tasks.' Larger issues of the non-salary resources available for infrastructure maintenance for the&#13;
entire elementary education system would be taken up during Annual Reviews.&#13;
(a) Dangerous and Shelterless Schools&#13;
2.19       In both the NA and AJK, all construction of school facilities (whether brand new or&#13;
reconstructed) supported by the project would be based on a revised design developed with the&#13;
assistance of external consultants. This design would be developed to address issues of space and&#13;
function, flexibility, seismic hazard, thermal conditions, lighting and acoustics. In the NA,&#13;
approximately 18 schools which are currently in such poor condition as to be considered dangerous&#13;
would be completely reconstructed, and approximately 22 currently shelterless Government-run&#13;
schools would receive new school buildings. In AJK, approximately 225 schools which are currently&#13;
classified as dangerous would be replaced, and about 125 new school buildings for currently&#13;
shelterless schools would be built (final determination of the numbers and locations of schools selected&#13;
for construction interventions would be made on the basis of the completed school mapping exercise).&#13;
In both AJK and the NA, priority for the construction of shelterless schools and classrooms would be&#13;
23 Costs for maintenance are included under the Community Participation component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
given to mixed primary and/or girls schools (primary and elementary levels). In view of the&#13;
importance parents accord to safety and privacy in decisions regarding schooling for girls, sanitary&#13;
units and boundary walls would also be provided for all girls schools receiving construction&#13;
interventions.&#13;
(b) Community School Construction&#13;
2.20       The DOE in the Northern Areas has embraced the establishment of community schools&#13;
as the main strategy for expansion of access to schooling in the region. Many such schools, however,&#13;
are currently housed in private homes ill-suited to the physical requirements of schooling. The&#13;
proposed project would support the participatory construction of approximately 450 school buildings&#13;
to serve community schools. In order to qualify for receipt of construction support, a community&#13;
school would minimally have to: (a) meet school mapping criteria for a minimum school-age&#13;
population base, as well as distance to neighboring schools; (b) have been in existence for at least two&#13;
years, during which time the school must have demonstrated an ability to maintain a minimum&#13;
number of students enrolled and ensured continuity of the teacher; and (c) be run by a village&#13;
education committee willing to provide land, labor, and local building materials in accordance with&#13;
program requirements.24 As with the provision of school buildings to currently shelterless schools,&#13;
priority would be given to mixed and/or girls schools.25&#13;
Strengthening Institutional Capacity&#13;
2.21       This component would support ongoing and planned efforts to: (a) strengthen the&#13;
management capacity of the Department/Directorate of Elementary Education through organizational&#13;
changes, the provision of limited additional staff, training, and technical assistance; (b) improve the&#13;
information base for planning and management decisions through the conduct of baseline studies,&#13;
rationalizing information flows and developing information management systems at the local level;&#13;
and (c) conduct regular monitoring and evaluation of the proposed five-year program.&#13;
(a) Strengthening the Department/Directorate of Education&#13;
2.22       In both the NA and AJK, the project would support some additions to and/or&#13;
rearrangements of current staffing in the Department/Directorate of Education and district offices. In&#13;
AJK, where overall staffing levels are generally adequate, any new positions would be created&#13;
through redeployment rather than the creation of new posts. Priority attention would be given to&#13;
adequate staffing of those units bearing primary responsibility for the elementary education program,&#13;
including the Directorate of Public Instruction for Elementary Education (DPIEE), the curriculum unit&#13;
(CRDC) and to the in-service teacher training unit (EEC). Assurances regarding the adequate staffing&#13;
of the DOEs were received at Negotiations (para. 5.2(g)). In the NA, where the Directorate of&#13;
Education in the NA currently consists of a very small cadre of professional staff at the central and&#13;
district level, with little or no formal specialization of functions, staffing would be reorganized to&#13;
24 Verification of the voluntary nature of land contribution will be undertaken as part of the community&#13;
"dialogue" process with the assistance of AKRSP.&#13;
25 The vast majority of community schools have already been established as mixed or girls primary&#13;
schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
reflect the following functions at the central level: (a) academics; (b) planning, development and&#13;
monitoring; (c) administration; and (d) colleges. A small technical cell with the capacity to plan and&#13;
supervise civil works would be added under the planning function. The majority of incremental&#13;
positions would be added through internal adjustment of posts and contract positions. Additional&#13;
posts of Assistant Education Officers (s) responsible for school supervision would be added in both&#13;
AJK and the NA, and women would be actively recruited for both administrative and supervisory&#13;
posts. Permanent posts added by the project would be financed on a declining basis. An organigram&#13;
and chart showing proposed organizational structure and additions to current posts is found in Annex&#13;
7. A draft policy on postings and transfers in AJK was agreed during Negotiations (para. 5.2(0)).&#13;
2.23       In addition to adequate staffing, institutional capacity would be strengthened through the&#13;
provision of better tools and facilities (furniture, computers, photocopiers and the like), as well as&#13;
technical assistance and training. In both the NA and AJK, technical assistance would be provided&#13;
under the project to support the following activities, among others: (a) the development of job&#13;
descriptions and performance evaluation tools for managers and supervisors at all levels; (b) the&#13;
development of guidelines for supervisory visits to schools; (c) further identification of staff training&#13;
needs; and (d) the design and provision of training to managers and supervisors (including training in&#13;
IDA management and procurement requirements). Training may take the form of specially designed&#13;
courses given in-house, exposure to short courses available through other institutions in Pakistan,&#13;
and/or study tours to neighboring countries to examine existing systems for planning and&#13;
development, supervision, and monitoring.&#13;
2.24       School supervision would be improved through: (a) an improved ratio of supervisors to&#13;
schools; (b) training for supervisory staff; (c) the provision of jeeps to female supervisory staff; (d)&#13;
evaluation and further experimentation with school clustering, through which a middle school serves&#13;
as a resource center for surrounding schools; and (e) increased community involvement.&#13;
(b) Improving Education Management Information Systems&#13;
2.25       In both the NA and AJK, the project would support the further development of an&#13;
information management system (EMIS). The ultimate goal of such a system would be that each area&#13;
would have a timely source of accurate information for the purpose of educational planning,&#13;
monitoring, and decision making. In AJK, where the existing EMIS cell is at least functioning as a&#13;
satellite data collection and processing unit for the collection of federally mandated educational&#13;
statistics, emphasis would be placed on strengthening staffing, improving data collection and&#13;
verification procedures, creating greater understanding of, and incentives for, information reporting&#13;
and use, and gradually expanding the system to take into account more AJK specific information&#13;
needs. In the NA, where a system would essentially have to be built from the ground up, the initial&#13;
strategy would be to rationalize current data collection procedures and information use and at least&#13;
coordinate data collection with that done at the federal level through the Academy for Educational&#13;
Development and Management. As feasible in both areas, additional information from baseline&#13;
studies (such as the school mapping exercise) would gradually be integrated into the local system.&#13;
The project would support the provision of computers at the central and district levels, the training of&#13;
staff, and technical assistance in the conduct of studies and systems design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
(c) Strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
2.26       To the greatest extent possible, monitoring and evaluation activities under the project&#13;
will derive from and be integrated into the regular functioning of the educational systems of the NA&#13;
and AJK. The principal modalities would be: (a) systemic monitoring by educational management&#13;
staff; (b) annual, midterm, and final reviews; (c) special studies or reviews undertaken for specific&#13;
project components and (d) a baseline and end-of-project sample based survey of student achievement&#13;
to determine progress in student learning over the project period. Technical assistance and training&#13;
for strengthening systemic monitoring would be largely provided under sub-components (a) and (b),&#13;
while this sub-component of the project would support field-based studies to assess institutional&#13;
processes (including beneficiary feedback) and the contracting of technical assistance for achievement&#13;
testing. Monitoring indicators for the project have been developed and are described in detail in&#13;
Annex 6. At Negotiations, assurances were given that the Government will monitor and evaluate the&#13;
implementation of the project in accordance with agreed Performance Indicators (para. 5.2 (n)).&#13;
Community Participation&#13;
2.27       Given the very different circumstances of the NA and AJK with regard to current levels&#13;
of community participation in education, the project would support different strategies in each area.&#13;
In the NA, the primary strategy for increasing community participation would be continued support to&#13;
and improvement of the existing community schools program. In AJK, the primary strategy would be&#13;
the establishment school committees in existing Government schools.&#13;
(a) Support to Community Schools&#13;
2.28       The community schools program started by the DOE under the SAP initiative is&#13;
currently the main avenue for increased access to schooling in the Northern Areas. So central is the&#13;
notion of community participation to the overall DOE strategy for education, that in effect all&#13;
components of the proposed project support the community schools program in some form. Teacher&#13;
training opportunities for community school teachers, for example, would be provided under the&#13;
Quality Improvement component. Similarly, provision of self-help construction support to community&#13;
schools has been included under the Increasing Equitable Access component. Support to community&#13;
schools under the Community Participation component would complement these activities by&#13;
providing additional financial, technical, and institutional support for the expansion and consolidation&#13;
of the program.&#13;
2.29       While it is still unclear in the absence of a school mapping exercise exactly how many&#13;
additional schools are actually needed in the NA, it is clear that: (a) given low primary coverage&#13;
rates in the NA, more communities would be eligible to receive a school than have been served thus&#13;
far; and (b) existing and future community schools will need more financial support to survive on a&#13;
self-sustaining basis than the one-time Rs. 100,000 grant initially allocated. Under the proposed&#13;
project, additional financial support would be provided for up to a maximum of 800 schools. This&#13;
support will take the form of grants to eligible community schools, to be used for, inter alia, payment&#13;
of teachers' salaries, school supplies, and building rental and maintenance. Eligibility criteria for the&#13;
establishment and funding of community schools have been reviewed and agreed upon between the&#13;
DOE and IDA, and would be revised during the course of implementation based on mutual agreement&#13;
(see Annex 3). During Negotiations, the Government and IDA agreed on the terms, conditions and&#13;
procedures of grants (para. 5.2 (1)). Further assurances were received at Negotiations that support to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
community schools in the NA will be provided in accordance with policies, procedures and guidelines&#13;
satisfactory to IDA and publicly announced no later than December 31, 1998 (para. 5.2(m)). A&#13;
condition of disbursement for grants to community schools will be in conformity with the terms of&#13;
conditions agreed with IDA (para. 5.3(c)).&#13;
2.30       Additional technical and institutional support would include: (a) social organization and&#13;
mobilization training for DOE staff, to enable them to work more effectively with Village Education&#13;
Committees (VECs) and Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs); (b) a joint Government-AKESP&#13;
Community School Development project to pilot various modalities of management and financial&#13;
support to community schools; and (c) technical assistance and training for DOE staff involved in the&#13;
design and supervision of the community schools program. The project would also support increasing&#13;
the levels of community participation in regular Government schools through the creation of PTAs,&#13;
and the development of school supervision and physical maintenance routines in conjunction with&#13;
local communities. As stated in the description of the Increasing Equitable Access component,&#13;
maintenance funds for community schools receiving construction assistance would be provided by the&#13;
DOE and matched by the community, and Village Education Committees and/or PTAs would be&#13;
trained in routine maintenance and upkeep.&#13;
(b) Establishment of School Committees&#13;
2.31       In AJK, the basic strategy for increasing community participation in education would be&#13;
through the formation of school committees at the village level. This strategy is consistent with a&#13;
longstanding proposal for the formation of village education committees under SAP which has yet to&#13;
be put in practice in AJK. Under the proposed project, the process of school committee formation&#13;
would begin on a pilot basis in a single district, and would involve both the training of Assistant&#13;
Education Officers (AEOs) in community mobilization techniques, and the training of newly formed&#13;
school committees in their responsibilities.26 Technical assistance in coordination of community&#13;
mobilization efforts through an NGO or firm would be provided at the level of the DPIEE.&#13;
2.32       Under the proposed design, the formation of school committees in the pilot district&#13;
would at least initially be done in conjunction with the reconstruction of dangerous and building of&#13;
shelterless schools under the project. The reasons for making this connection are threefold: (a) first,&#13;
the fact of an investment in physical infrastructure is likely to mobilize the community around the&#13;
school and school issues; (b) second, an organized school committee can help oversee the construction&#13;
process (although not necessarily the most technical aspects); and (c) one of the functions of the&#13;
school committee would be the ongoing maintenance of the newly constructed school, thereby&#13;
preserving the value of the investment under the project. By the time of the project Mid-Term&#13;
Review, it is expected that a minimum of 50 school committees should be functioning in the pilot&#13;
district. A decision as to whether to continue the pilot, modify it, expand it, or terminate it would be&#13;
made at that point. In view of the fact that the Civil Engineering Cell within the Department of&#13;
Education does not have experience with community participation in construction, the project would&#13;
not necessarily follow a participatory approach to the construction itself. As has been the pattern in&#13;
26 These may include: (a) decision making with regard to school-related investments and purchases; (b)&#13;
fundraising and administration of funds; (c) regular monitoring of teacher and student attendance; (d) building&#13;
maintenance; (e) oversight of construction/reconstruction; and (f) serving as education advocates within the&#13;
larger community, among others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
the past, however, communities would be asked to donate the land for the construction of currently&#13;
shelterless schools (land for the reconstruction of dangerous schools is presumed to be adequate).27&#13;
C. Project Management and Implementation&#13;
Project Management and Coordination&#13;
2.33       By following a program approach to the elementary sector in the NA and AJK, the&#13;
proposed project endeavors to: (a) ensure that all activities to be undertaken over the project period&#13;
are consistent with the regions' overall policy and investment priorities; (b) ensure that planned&#13;
incremental activities will not over-burden existing financial or institutional capacity; and (c) minimize&#13;
the burden of "special" project monitoring and reporting procedures. With regard to project&#13;
management and implementation arrangements, the program approach also favors the strengthening of&#13;
implementation capacity in existing institutions, rather than the creation of a separate PIU.&#13;
Experience in projects in Pakistan and elsewhere has indicated that unless line departments feel&#13;
themselves responsible for project activities, the likelihood of timely implementation and/or project&#13;
sustainability is extremely low.&#13;
2.34       In both AJK and the NA, therefore, the project would be implemented through the&#13;
existing Department/Directorate of Education in cooperation with participating NGOs. The Director&#13;
of Education in the NA and the Secretary of Education in AJK would have overall management&#13;
responsibility, with much of the day-to-day responsibility for coordinating implementation in AJK&#13;
delegated to the Director for Public Instruction, Elementary Education (DPIEE). Overall program&#13;
and policy directions, annual plans and budgets would be discussed and agreed by a Program Steering&#13;
Committee which would meet at least twice annually. In the NA, this committee would be chaired by&#13;
the Chief Secretary, Northern Areas, and would include representatives from Planning and&#13;
Development, Finance, selected DOE staff, an experienced educationist from outside the DOE, as&#13;
well as representatives from both AKESP and AKRSP. In AJK, the Program Steering Committee&#13;
would be chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary and would include representatives from the&#13;
Secretariats of Planning and Development and Finance, as well as representatives from DOE&#13;
departments involved in various aspects of program/project implementation. The KANA/SAFRON&#13;
Ministry and the federal Ministry of Education would also bear responsibility for project oversight,&#13;
but there would be no special project coordinating unit at the federal level.&#13;
2.35       Project coordination in both the NA and AJK would be enhanced through the&#13;
establishment of Project Implementation Committees within the Department/Directorate of Education.&#13;
These committees would meet on a monthly basis to coordinate planning and implementation&#13;
activities, monitor program progress, and discuss and resolve any issues relating to program/project&#13;
implementation. In AJK, this committee would be chaired by the DPIEE, and would include&#13;
representatives of all departments and agencies involved in project implementation. Given the&#13;
smaller size of the NA Directorate of Education, the Implementation Committee is likely to be a more&#13;
informal body. It was agreed between AKESP, AKRSP and the DOE for the NA, however, that the&#13;
formation of an NGO-DOE coordinating committee would be established for the purpose of&#13;
coordinating teacher training initiatives, the community school development project, and training&#13;
27 Verification of the voluntary nature of land contribution will be undertaken as part of the community&#13;
mobilization process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
workshops for DOE staff in community mobilization techniques. Agreement that the NA and AJK&#13;
Steering Committees would meet at least twice yearly and that Implementation Committees would&#13;
meet monthly was reached at Negotiations (para. 5.2(c)).&#13;
Implementation Timeline and Modalities&#13;
2.36       The project would be implemented over five years in both the NA and AJK, starting in&#13;
the first semester of FY97/98 and closing on June 30, 2002. Development projects in Pakistan must&#13;
be presented to the approving Government authorities in a prescribed detailed format, known as a&#13;
PC-1. A PC-1 for each region has been prepared for the entire five year period. Prior to&#13;
Negotiations, IDA received both draft and final versions of the project PC-ls for both regions, the&#13;
final versions having already been approved by the Executive Committee of the Federal Government's&#13;
National Economic Council (para. 5.1(b)). The PC- ls provide flexible but clear guidelines for&#13;
project implementation and will be supplemented by a more detailed Project Implementation Plan&#13;
(PIP) prepared by the Government as well as the preparation of Annual Plans. Prior to Negotiations,&#13;
IDA also received a completed draft version of the PIP for each region (para. 5.1 (c)). Submission of&#13;
the first Annual Plan for 1997-98 satisfactory to IDA was a condition of Board Presentation that was&#13;
also satisfied at Negotiations (para. 5.2(q)).&#13;
Implementation Responsibilities&#13;
2.37       On a day-to-day basis, the Directorate/Department of Education would be responsible&#13;
for: (a) monitoring program costs and program accounts; (b) processing disbursement applications&#13;
and keeping track of disbursement of credit funds; (c) procurement of equipment and administration&#13;
of contracts; (d) placement and tracking of any local staff receiving training abroad; (e) monitoring&#13;
program/project implementation; and (f) preparation of annual plans and periodic consolidated reports&#13;
on the progress of project implementation, with reference to agreed monitoring indicators. Specific&#13;
implementation responsibilities by objectives and components for both the NA and AJK are found in&#13;
Annex 7.&#13;
Role of NGOs&#13;
2.38       NGOs under the project would for the most part play a role of providing technical&#13;
assistance and training, but would also be responsible for some aspects of project implementation&#13;
(these would include AKESP, AKRSP, and the NGO or firm selected to provide technical assistance&#13;
to AJK under the community participation component). In the NA, both AKRSP and AKESP would&#13;
be considered an integral part of the program, and would participate in the Program Steering&#13;
Committee. In addition, AKRSP would: (a) provide support in the identification of communities&#13;
eligible for receiving community school funding, increase awareness among communities regarding&#13;
program criteria; and to extent possible support the dialogue process leading up to the signed Terms&#13;
of Partnership between the Government and the community; (b) provide social mobilization training&#13;
for DOE staff; (c) in collaboration with the DOE (and AKESP), develop training materials to be used&#13;
with VECs, school management committees, and PTAs, and train Directorate of Education staff in&#13;
their use; and (d) to the extent possible, provide technical support to the DOE in training of VECs,&#13;
school committees and PTAs. AKESP would: (a) help with the expansion of field-based teacher&#13;
training efforts through opening of additional FBTD centers for Government and community school&#13;
teachers, thus giving the Government additional time to expand its own capacity; and (b) participate&#13;
in a pilot project to develop the community schools program through experimentation with different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
management and financial mechanisms in a small sample of schools. Both organizations would also&#13;
participate in the ongoing monitoring of the NEP through regular contact with Directorate of&#13;
Education staff at different levels. At Negotiations, the Government provided IDA with assurances&#13;
that it will enter into an agreement with the relevant AKDN agencies regarding their participation&#13;
under the project, based on the draft technical proposal submitted to IDA and the approved PC-1&#13;
(para. 5.2(k)).&#13;
2.39       Given the relative lack of experience with community mobilization techniques within the&#13;
Department of Education in AJK, technical assistance in this area will be an important factor in the&#13;
success of the proposed pilot. Either an NGO or a private firm with extensive experience in&#13;
community mobilization would be most appropriate for such an assignment. Technical assistance in&#13;
coordinating the community mobilization effort would be provided to the DOE primarily in the form&#13;
of a project coordinator with a strong background in training and social mobilization initiatives. The&#13;
community mobilization coordinator would be expected to divide his/her time between on-site training&#13;
of AEOs and school committees in the pilot district, and wider education efforts and reporting&#13;
functions at the level of the DPIEE (for example, the arrangement of two study tours for policy&#13;
makers and DPIEE and district staff to look at community mobilization efforts elsewhere in Pakistan).&#13;
To the extent that there are already other social mobilization efforts underway in the pilot district, the&#13;
project coordinator and district-level AEOs would be responsible for coordinating with existing efforts&#13;
to the maximum extent possible.&#13;
D. Monitoring, Evaluation, and Supervision&#13;
2.40       Project monitoring and evaluation activities would be integrated into regular DOE&#13;
functions and responsibilities, and would form part of the overall effort to build institutional capacity&#13;
(see also para. 2.26, Annex 6 and Annex 11).&#13;
Program and Project Progress and Reporting&#13;
2.41       The Directorate of Education in NA and the Department of Education in AJK, supported&#13;
by local consultants and inputs from NGOs, would be responsible for ongoing monitoring and&#13;
reporting to IDA on program and project progress. They would produce annual progress reports and&#13;
an annual detailed operational plan for the coming year. The reports would: include a narrative&#13;
section describing major project achievements and problems encountered; compare actual&#13;
accomplishments to agreed plans, including references to agreed project monitoring indicators; and&#13;
propose future actions. Detailed formats of the progress reports would be agreed during the project&#13;
launch. Agreement that the Government would prepare and submit to IDA annual progress reports to&#13;
IDA was confirmed during Negotiations (para. 5.2(e)). In addition, assurances were given during&#13;
Negotiations that a joint Government and IDA Mid-Term review would be conducted by May 2000&#13;
(para. 5.2(h)); and that an Implementation Completion Report would be submitted by the&#13;
Governments to IDA within six months of the closing date of the Project (para. 5.2(i)). Monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of technical assistance under the project would be integrated into ongoing monitoring&#13;
efforts and would be a special focus of the Mid-Term Review. Suggestions for monitoring indicators&#13;
are found in Annex 11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
IDA Supervision&#13;
2.42       Primary responsibility for supervision arrangements would be with IDA's Resident&#13;
Mission in Pakistan. Program and project supervision would be conducted semi-annually, with a full&#13;
mission mounted only annually -- typically in April/May coinciding with the budget approval cycle&#13;
and the discussion of operational plans. Local consultants to be financed under the IDA Credit would&#13;
assist in supervision activities, especially during the October/November missions. Annual supervision&#13;
missions would: (a) require at least two weeks in the field; (b) require the services of specialists in&#13;
education, school construction, management/community, and finance; and (c) review progress of&#13;
program and project components, as well as procurement, financial statements and disbursements,&#13;
credit covenants and the implementation of technical assistance. Specialized skill requirements would&#13;
be added to the missions according to needs identified by previous supervision missions. The&#13;
indicators discussed in Annexes 6 and 11 would assist project managers and supervision missions in&#13;
monitoring progress and achievements. Supervision of the NEP in the NA would be done in tandem&#13;
with other donors (specifically British DFID), so as to enhance project cohesiveness and minimize the&#13;
time-burden on the DOE. A supervision schedule is included in Annex 8.&#13;

III. PROGRAM AND PROJECT COSTS&#13;
A. Program Costs&#13;
3.1        A breakdown of elementary education program costs and the program financing plan is&#13;
shown in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. The total cost of the elementary program in the NA and AJK is&#13;
estimated at US$185.5 million equivalent (NA, US$56.2 million, and AJK US$129.3 million).&#13;
Program costs include the elementary education development and non-development (recurrent)&#13;
resource requirements over the period 1997-98 to 2001-02. Ongoing development schemes in the&#13;
elementary sub-sector have been included as well as agreed new schemes, most prominently the NEP.&#13;
It has been assumed that in the NA, 12 percent of the non-development (recurrent) requirements will&#13;
be devoted to non-salary items. In AJK, it has been assumed that by 2001-02, non salary elementary&#13;
education will grow to 10 percent of the elementary recurrent allocations. The total development&#13;
spending for this program is 27 percent of the program cost; the largest part of the balance is&#13;
constituted by the salary bill. The Government will finance an increasing portion of the total program&#13;
costs over the five years; donors and communities will finance the balance. The estimated IDA&#13;
contribution will be US$22.8 million equivalent, 12.3 percent of the total program costs. The&#13;
contribution from the proposed next round of SAP, which will be complementary to the NEP, is&#13;
anticipated to be about US$14.3 million equivalent, or 7.7 percent of the program costs. The DFID&#13;
has proposed financing selected program activities in the NA for a total of approximately US$ 3.1&#13;
million equivalent, or 5.5 percent of program costs in the NA. Communities are expected to&#13;
contribute about US$2.5 million equivalent in the form of labor and local building materials for the&#13;
construction of schools, as well as matching contributions for maintenance and learning materials&#13;
costs. Habitual contributions by the community in the form of donated land, uniform and textbook&#13;
purchases, or other forms of parental and community spending have not been included in program&#13;
cost calculations.&#13;
B. Project Costs&#13;
3.2        The IDA credit of US$22.8 million equivalent would finance about 63 percent of total&#13;
project costs of US$36.0 million equivalent. Estimates of project cost by component are presented in&#13;
table 3.3. Detailed costs by region, components, and categories of expenditure are found in Annex 9.&#13;
3.3        Basis of Cost Estimates. Base costs at appraisal (March 1996) have been updated as of&#13;
April 1997 as part of the preparation of regional PC-ls. Base costs are calculated as follows: (a)&#13;
civil works are based on current market rates; (b) vehicles, equipment, furniture, books and supplies&#13;
are based on lists of items prepared by the Directorate/Department of Education of the NA and AJK&#13;
on the basis of prevailing c.i.f. prices or local market prices as applicable; (c) costs of consultants and&#13;
technical assistance reflect current rates, and overseas fellowships are based on regional costs; and (d)&#13;
the costs of salaries and allowances are based on current GOP scales.&#13;
3.4        Customs and Duties. Goods specifically imported for the project may be admitted free&#13;
of duties and taxes. Locally procured goods and services, including materials for construction and&#13;
construction contracts carry duties and taxes at varying rates. Project costs include import duties and&#13;
taxes estimated at a total of US$2.3 million equivalent.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

3.5        Contingencies and Allowances. Project cost estimates include physical contingencies&#13;
(US$1.2 million) averaging four percent of base costs. A physical contingency of 7 percent was&#13;
applied to civil works, and five percent to vehicles, equipment, and furniture. Price contingencies&#13;
amount to US$2.0 million, or six percent of base costs. Annual inflation estimates for local costs are:&#13;
9.0 percent in FY1997-98, 7.7 percent in FY1998-99, 7.1 percent in FY1999-00, and 6.9 percent in&#13;
FY2000-01, and in FY2001-02. Annual inflation estimates for foreign costs are 2.2 percent in FY&#13;
1997-98, 2.6 percent in FY1998-99, 2.8 percent in FY1999-00, and 2.4 percent in FY2000-01 and&#13;
FY2001-02.&#13;
3.6        Foreign Exchange Component and Local Cost Financing. The estimated foreign&#13;
exchange component (US$7.9 million), including contingencies, represents 22 percent of total project&#13;
costs. It has been calculated based on the following assumptions regarding foreign exchange content:&#13;
(a) civil works - 10 percent; (b) vehicles - 72 percent; (c) books and materials - 73 percent; (d)&#13;
equipment - 87 percent; (e) international consultants and fellowships - 85 percent; (f) furniture - 4&#13;
percent; (g) grants and honorarium - 23 percent; (h) operations and maintenance - 15 percent; and (i)&#13;
other operational costs - 33 percent. These assumptions are derived from experience with similar&#13;
projects in Pakistan. The high local cost component of the project is fairly typical of primary&#13;
education projects, where many activities involve inputs which are widely available locally or are by&#13;
their nature locally based. For example although foreign consultants are involved under the project in&#13;
improving the content and methodology of teacher training, the costs of teacher training itself are&#13;
predominantly local. Similarly, school construction under the project involves building simple&#13;
structures in extremely remote areas, where reliance on local materials and labor results in dramatic&#13;
savings on both initial construction and maintenance costs. Given both the goals and nature of the&#13;
project, the high local cost component is justified.&#13;
C. Financing Arrangements&#13;
3.7        The IDA Credit of US$22.8 million equivalent would finance about 63 percent of costs&#13;
net of taxes and duties (estimated at US$2.3 million). DFID would finance a portion of NEP&#13;
activities in the NA, amounting to 8.6 percent of the project overall (estimated at US$3.1 million).&#13;
The GOP would contribute US$ 7.7 million equivalent (21.5 percent of total project costs), while&#13;
community contributions to construction and maintenance would make up the remaining 7 percent&#13;
(costs are estimated at US$2.5 million). A financing plan is found in Table 3.4. At Negotiations, the&#13;
Government confirmed that it intends to enter into an agreement with DFID for financing of a portion&#13;
of program activities in the NA (para. 5.2(o)). Fulfillment of DFID's conditions of effectiveness&#13;
would be a condition of disbursement for the IDA credit in the NA (para. 5.3(a)).&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
3.8        The program nature of the project makes it difficult to forecast in detail both the total&#13;
procurement amounts for different categories of expenditure and the anticipated amounts of IDA&#13;
financing within these categories. The figures given below and in Table 3.5 should be regarded as&#13;
indicative; final details would be discussed between the Governments and IDA as part of the regular&#13;
yearly agreements. Procurement of goods, services, and works financed by the IDA credit would be&#13;
undertaken in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
(January 1995, revised January and August 1996). The Government's national competitive bidding&#13;
procedures, already used in on-going IDA funded projects, have been found to be satisfactory and&#13;
acceptable to IDA.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
3.9        The project would finance the procurement of civil works (about US$17.3 million&#13;
equivalent); vehicles (about US$1.2 million equivalent); equipment, including computers (about&#13;
US$0.7 million equivalent); furniture (about US$2.3 million equivalent); books and materials (about&#13;
US$0.9 million equivalent); technical assistance (both institutional development -- about US$4.5&#13;
million equivalent, and training -- about US$2.2 million equivalent); community grants and NGO&#13;
contracts (about US$3.1 million equivalent); incremental staff salaries (about US$2.2 million&#13;
equivalent), and operating costs, including school maintenance and travel/daily allowances (about&#13;
US$1.7 million equivalent). Most procurement under the project is expected to involve small&#13;
contracts spread over widely dispersed geographical areas and throughout the project period. The&#13;
nature of such contracts is unlikely to interest foreign bidders, and would, therefore, be suitable only&#13;
for National Competitive Bidding (NCB), and prudent shopping. The exception would be vehicles,&#13;
which would be procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. At&#13;
Negotiations, the Government provided sample bidding documents for (a) vehicle procurement&#13;
through ICB (using Bank Standard Bidding documents); and (b) equipment procurement through NCB&#13;
(para. 5.2.(d)).&#13;
3.10       IDA Review Requirements. IDA, would review all ICB and contracts above&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent, as well as the first four contracts in each area irrespective of their value. All&#13;
other contracts would be subject to selective post-review. All consultants would be selected in&#13;
accordance with IDA guidelines, which include prior review of all contracts with consulting firms&#13;
costing the equivalent of US$50,000 or more and with individual consultants costing the equivalent of&#13;
US$50,000 or more. Other procurement arrangement subject to prior review by IDA include: (a) all&#13;
single-source contracts; (b) all contracts for assignments of a critical nature, as determined by IDA;&#13;
(c) amendments to IDA-financed contracts raising the contract value above US$100,000 for consulting&#13;
firms or US$50,000 for individuals; and (d) terms of reference for technical assistance and training.&#13;
Selection and employment of consultants would be undertaken in accordance with the Guidelines&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997).&#13;
E. Disbursements&#13;
3.11       The proposed IDA credit of US$22.8 million equivalent would cover expenditures&#13;
incurred from FY1997-98 to FY2001-02. Actual annual disbursement would depend on performance,&#13;
and the pattern of expenditure yearly agreed upon. Estimated annual disbursements are presented in&#13;
Annex 10. The proposed project would cover reimbursements for incremental expenditures under the&#13;
project, while SAPP would continue to reimburse at about its established level for NA and AJK.&#13;
Both the NEP and SAPP projects would place particular emphasis on increasing non-salary recurrent&#13;
allocations, and ensuring the timely release of budgets within the first quarter of each fiscal year.&#13;
Agreement that Government funds would be released to the Department/Directorate of Education by&#13;
the fifteenth of the first month of every quarter was reached during Negotiations (para. 5.2(b)).&#13;
3.12       The project would reimburse a proportion of all eligible expenditures incurred in the&#13;
elementary education sectors of the NA and AJK, excluding any already donor-aided projects and/or&#13;
activities.28 The annual agreement between the Government and IDA (and any other project donors)&#13;
28 There are none at present -- two donor-aided projects in the elementary education sector in AJK are&#13;
scheduled to end by December 1996. DFID financing of technical assistance and NGO activities in the NA may&#13;
follow separate DFID disbursement procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
would include a detailed identification of eligible categories of expenditure. Certain categories of&#13;
expenditure have been identified as outside the project, and are therefore ineligible for project&#13;
funding. These include development and recurrent expenditures for the secondary and higher level of&#13;
education, with the exception of construction of female teacher training colleges in the NA. Other&#13;
expenditure categories such as land acquisition, taxes, and duties are ineligible under IDA rules.&#13;
Apart from these exceptions, all expenditures incurred in the delivery of elementary education&#13;
including incremental salaries, operating expenses, training, civil works and maintenance expenses&#13;
would be eligible.&#13;
3.13       Reimbursement would be claimed at least quarterly and perhaps more frequently,&#13;
depending on the capacity of the NA and AJK to generate claims. Claims would normally be made in&#13;
the form of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) specifying categories of expenditure and total eligible&#13;
expenditure. In those few cases where contracts for goods and civil works exceed US$200,000&#13;
equivalent, US$100,000 for consulting firms or US$50,000 for individual consultants, full&#13;
documentation would be required. All claims would be certified by the respective Secretaries of the&#13;
DOEs, who would then submit them to IDA. Only claims above US$ 50,000 equivalent would be&#13;
submitted to IDA for reimbursement/payment. SOEs would have to be received by IDA within six&#13;
months of the end of the fiscal year in which the expenditure was incurred. This would ensure&#13;
flexible reallocation of unused resources from portions of the program which may be underspending,&#13;
and maximum funding availability for those areas of the program where expenditures are occurring.&#13;
3.14       Credit disbursements would finance: (a) 70 percent of all expenditures on civil works,&#13;
70 percent of all expenditures on furniture and 20 percent of all expenditures on other operational&#13;
costs during FY1998 -- thereafter such percentage will be annually agreed between the Governments&#13;
and IDA; (b) 100 percent of foreign and 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 85&#13;
percent of local expenditures procured locally on vehicles and equipment; (c) 100 percent of all&#13;
expenditures on books and materials, technical assistance, and training; (d) 100 percent of&#13;
expenditures on incremental salaries until June 30, 1999; 60 percent until June 30, 2001; and 40&#13;
percent thereafter; and (e) community support at 97 percent.&#13;
3.15       Special Accounts. To ensure timely and efficient execution of project activities, two&#13;
special accounts, one for the NA and one for AJK, would be established. In both cases, the accounts&#13;
would be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The authorized amount of the Special&#13;
Account for the NA would be US$400,000 equivalent, with an initial deposit limited to US$200,000.&#13;
In the case of AJK, the authorized amount would be US$300,000 equivalent, with an initial deposit&#13;
limited to US$150,000 equivalent. Funds from the Special Accounts would be available for financing&#13;
only IDA's share of eligible project expenditures. IDA would replenish the Special Accounts upon&#13;
receipt of satisfactory evidence that expenditures were eligible for financing out of the accounts.&#13;
Withdrawals from the Special Accounts would be possible after IDA receives confirmation of: (a) the&#13;
appointment of qualified accountants in each region, having a minimum of five years experience and&#13;
BS-17 or above; and (b) plans for the establishment of a financial management system for project&#13;
implementation in both areas.&#13;
F. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.16       The DOE in each region would maintain separate accounts of project expenditures in&#13;
accordance with sound accounting practices, and project accounts would be audited in accordance&#13;
with Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (1992).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
Financial management procedures and provisions for accounting, disbursement, and procurement staff&#13;
have been agreed with the Government. The project would support technical assistance and training&#13;
to strengthen financial management in the NA and AJK. Additional details are found in Annex 12.&#13;
The accounts, SOEs and procurement documentation would be audited each year by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA and submitted to IDA no later than six months after the end of the relevant&#13;
fiscal year. The audit reports would include an assessment of the adequacy of the accounting system&#13;
and internal financial control, the reliability of SOEs, use of Special Accounts and the degree of&#13;
compliance with agreed financial arrangements. Agreement that the Governments would maintain&#13;
separate project accounts which would be audited yearly by independent auditors acceptable to IDA&#13;
was confirmed during Negotiations (para. 5.2(f)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
IV. ASSESSMENTS&#13;
A. Financial Assessment and Sustainability&#13;
4.1        If the Government's current priorities of improving access to and quality of elementary&#13;
education are to be implemented, the level of educational expenditures would need to increase over&#13;
the next few years. In the NA, a large proportion of the needed expenditures at the elementary level&#13;
represents investments in access and quality improvements which will have important pay-offs in the&#13;
medium and longer term and without which the system will remain stagnant and call for much larger&#13;
investments in later years. Increased allocations to elementary education in AJK are also necessary to&#13;
make up for the low quality and deficits in education stocks; low levels of spending and a focus on&#13;
the expansion of access at the expense of quality have resulted in low student achievement and poor&#13;
education assets, such as inadequately trained teachers, dangerous and poorly maintained schools, and&#13;
lack of school equipment.&#13;
4.2        In order to meet program needs, the share of education in the total ADP will need to&#13;
increase over the next five years. It is estimated that education development expenditures would need&#13;
to rise at an average annual rate of 18 percent and 17 percent in the NA and AJK respectively over&#13;
the project period (compared to an average annual increase of 21 percent and 3 percent in NA and&#13;
AJK respectively over the past five years). The declining trend in the recurrent (non-development)&#13;
spending in elementary education also needs to be reversed. In the NA, elementary education non-&#13;
development expenditures will need to increase at an average of 11 percent in real terms. Non-salary&#13;
allocations will need to be maintained at the 1995-96 level of 12 percent of the elementary education&#13;
allocations. In AJK, elementary non-development allocations will need to increase faster than for the&#13;
sector as a whole, 11 percent versus 9 percent, in order to make up for the recent declines. Non-&#13;
salary allocations, practically non-existent at present, will need to grow at an average of about 28&#13;
percent (see Annex 2 for tables and additional information).&#13;
4.3        These increases in the NA and AJK budgets are proportionally large when compared to&#13;
the very low current allocations, but very modest in absolute terms. They are marginal increases&#13;
within the context of the total federal budget. The education sector development expenditures in the&#13;
NA and AJK represent a very small part of the total federal development expenditures -- only about&#13;
one quarter of one percent in 1995-96. The projected education sector allocations (inclusive of the&#13;
proposed project) required during 1996-97 to 2001-02 would increase the above mentioned share to&#13;
less than one half of one percent. The increases planned for the NA and AJK education sector&#13;
budgets as part of the overall budget are thus extremely small and well within the capacity of the&#13;
federal Government. Federal commitment to providing these levels of increased resources to the NA&#13;
and AJK was confirmed at Negotiations.&#13;
4.4        With regard to the sustainability of project investments beyond the life of the project, the&#13;
level of recurrent resources required to sustain quality improvement, institutional development, and&#13;
infrastructure investments is likely to be low. Increased involvement of communities in the&#13;
construction and/or maintenance of school buildings is expected to generate additional resources,&#13;
irnprove the communities' sense of ownership of, and responsibility for, school property, and&#13;
preserve investments over a longer time period through improved and more regular maintenance&#13;
routines. The heaviest potential burden on future NA education budgets may be the need for&#13;
continued support to community schools. Although it is the intent of the DOE to experiment with&#13;
mechanisms to make community schools virtually self-sustaining, this may not be a realistic goal,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
particularly in the poorest communities. Nevertheless, even if the DOE were to have to assume the&#13;
full cost of additional financial support in the form of a per-student subsidy to community schools,&#13;
the yearly cost is estimated to be only approximately four percent of the total program budget in the&#13;
final year of the program, or six percent of recurrent (non-development) resources during the same&#13;
year. This level of effort is considered financially manageable, and a relatively light burden given&#13;
that community school enrollments are projected to make up approximately 23 percent of total&#13;
enrollments by the final year of the program. SAP/SAPP policy and financial support (particularly&#13;
with regard to recurrent budgets and non-salary spending) are also expected to enhance project&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
B. Institutional Assessment&#13;
4.5        As indicated in Chapter I (paras. 1.31 to 1.38), institutional capacity is quite different in&#13;
AJK and the NA. Along with its much larger education system, the DOE in AJK is far larger and&#13;
more complex than the Directorate of Education in the NA, which has a skeletal staff and has not&#13;
seen any increases to central administration staff in the last 20 years. Institutional issues in AJK&#13;
center on effective coordination and use of existing staff and information, as well as upgrading of&#13;
skills, while in the NA the challenge for program implementation will be recruiting adequate staff,&#13;
training, and developing an organizational structure capable of effectively handling a fairly rapid&#13;
expansion of the education system. There is also a slightly higher level of technical expertise in the&#13;
education units in AJK (CRDC and the EMIS unit, for example) than exists in the NA. AJK also has&#13;
had limited experience with outside donor funding and regulations (for civil works, in particular),&#13;
while the NA has not had such prior experience.&#13;
4.6        Capacities also differ in the non-government sector. With the exception of the National&#13;
Rural Support Network, an NGO which has been operating for the last three years in the district of&#13;
Poonch, there are practically no professionally-managed NGOs in AJK, nor larger welfare&#13;
organizations with a track-record of broad-based community organization. In the NA, in contrast,&#13;
AKESP has 30 plus years of experience working in the education sector in the NA, while AKRSP has&#13;
been organizing community groups across the five districts for the last 15 years. While relatively&#13;
lean in terms of staff, both organizations have demonstrated capacity to initiate, staff, and monitor&#13;
programs. Although neither organization has had experience with formal Government relations, there&#13;
is a history of informal cooperation with Government agencies (including the DOE).&#13;
4.7        Given limitations to institutional capacity (particularly within the DOE), technical&#13;
assistance, both local (including NGOs) and foreign, is likely to be an important factor in smooth&#13;
project implementation in both regions. A detailed description of projected technical assistance needs,&#13;
as well as monitoring indicators, is included in Annex 11. With few exceptions, the objective of most&#13;
of the technical assistance envisioned would be the establishment of permanent institutional capacity,&#13;
through setting up baseline information and systems, and training of staff.&#13;
C. Economic Assessment, Benefits and Risks&#13;
Benefits&#13;
4.8         The project would directly or indirectly benefit over one million children over the five&#13;
years of project implementation, through a combination of improvements in school quality and access.&#13;
In the NA, it is expected that the project would expand overall enrollments at the elementary level by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
approximately 28 percent over current levels and double the-number of girls in school. An increased&#13;
level of literacy improves economic productivity and income-earning potential for both sexes; for&#13;
girls, additional years of education and literacy are known to have a positive effect on lowering&#13;
population growth and infant mortality (see also Annex 13). Difficulties with data collection and&#13;
information for the NA and AJK, lack of data on earnings in these regions, and problems in valuing&#13;
the broader social benefits that would accrue with the NEP project make formal cost-benefit and rates&#13;
of return analysis unfeasible. Rates of return to schooling in Pakistan, however, can be used as a&#13;
proxy. These rates are consistent with other studies which indicate that returns to education are high,&#13;
and that social returns to education are highest at the lower levels of education (20% private rate of&#13;
return and 13% social rate of return at the primary level)29.&#13;
4.9         Further benefits expected from the project include: (a) improvements in learning&#13;
achievement through better trained teachers, more appropriate materials, and a more hospitable&#13;
learning environment; (b) lower teacher absenteeism, improved school maintenance, and improved&#13;
system accountability through community participation in school management; (c) a reduction in&#13;
dropout rates (particularly for girls) and higher overall completion rates through a combination of&#13;
improvements in the learning environment, community sensitization and monitoring, the recruitment&#13;
of female teachers, and improved access at the middle levels; (d) improved availability of qualified&#13;
female teachers (in the NA); and (e) improvements in system management and resource allocation&#13;
through better information and planning practices and more qualified staff.&#13;
Cost Effectiveness&#13;
4.10       The overall aim of the proposed project is to improve the quality of and access to&#13;
elementary education, especially for female students. The design and preparation of the project were&#13;
aimed at developing the most cost effective approach to these objectives, given the prevailing&#13;
conditions in each region. Examples of alternative approaches evaluated include those chosen with&#13;
regard to construction, teacher training, and expansion of access. In the NA, for example, the&#13;
decision was made to proceed with a participatory approach to construction involving communities.&#13;
This approach is expected to lower overall construction costs by about 30 percent, and given a long&#13;
history of participatory construction in the NA, was considered viable. In AJK, in contrast, a&#13;
participatory approach to construction was not suggested, as the logical implementing agency had no&#13;
experience with this type of construction and the institutional hurdles were considered too great.&#13;
With regard to teacher training, the choice was made to expand the FBTD program to meet the bulk&#13;
of training needs in the NA. This program is a model of cost effective training for areas with great&#13;
need. It requires no investment in facilities, as it is conducted in existing schools and district offices.&#13;
Per-student costs for the training are lower than training done in colleges, but the effectiveness of&#13;
FBTD lies not only in its modest cost but in its intensive focus on practical skills.&#13;
4.11       Finally, in deciding how to approach the great need for expansion of access in the NA&#13;
while keeping the Government and region's fiscal constraints in mind, the project opted to support the&#13;
expansion of the community schools program. While the program is still quite new and available data&#13;
are not sufficient to support a robust cost-effectiveness analysis, existing data suggest that even after&#13;
increasing the level of financing to community schools they would be less expensive to run than the&#13;
normal Government school. Recent sector work on community participation in other parts of&#13;
29 Behrman, Jere R., 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Pakistan also suggests that schools with substantial community involvement tend to be more effective&#13;
in terms of learning outcomes (see Annex 13 for a more detailed discussion).'&#13;
Risks&#13;
4.12        During preparation, an effort has been made to analyze and reduce project risks.&#13;
Nevertheless, risks remain especially given the remoteness of the regions and their lack of experience&#13;
with projects. The project faces risks related to: (a) design, (b) implementation; (c) financial&#13;
environment and (d) political factors. With regard to project design, the heavy emphasis on&#13;
community participation presents both potential benefits and risks. Reliance on community&#13;
participation in construction may mean that construction moves more slowly. In AJK there is likely&#13;
to be substantial-institutional resistance to meaningful community involvement in school affairs, while&#13;
in the NA the reliance on community schools as the principal means for increasing access to education&#13;
risks overburdening communities and furthering inequities between the communities that can&#13;
contribute a lot, and those that can contribute very little to their children's education. The project has&#13;
attempted to mitigate these risks through the use of pilots, drawing on local expertise whenever&#13;
possible, and supporting and further developing the community school program. While the risks still&#13;
exist, we believe the potential benefits outweigh them. The absence or poor quality of basic data in&#13;
both areas also means that estimates of system needs may be considerably off. The project design has&#13;
attempted to take this risk into account by adopting a more flexible approach with Annual Reviews.&#13;
4.13        Implementation risks include the executing agencies' relatively weak institutional&#13;
capacity, lack of experience with Bank procedures and managerial requirements, heavy internal&#13;
bureaucracy, and the possible turnover of key managers and staff. The project addresses the first two&#13;
of these risks through keeping project components as simple as possible, relying whenever possible on&#13;
locally available expertise, strengthening critical DOE departments or areas, and including technical&#13;
assistance and training. While the project cannot change the Government's rules of business, it seeks&#13;
to avoid some levels of bureaucracy through dealing directly with the AJK and NA Governments as&#13;
much as possible, rather than channelling everything though a federal level coordination unit. The&#13;
last risk -- turnover of key managers and staff -- can without doubt have the most negative effects on&#13;
project implementation. Actions taken or to be taken to reduce this risk include making sure the&#13;
project is broadly discussed and supported within the existing institutions as part of project&#13;
preparation, planning for the provision of ongoing training and technical assistance, and using Annual&#13;
Reviews as a forum for raising overall concerns with the Government.&#13;
4.14        The principal financial risk to the project is the possible deleterious effects of federal&#13;
budget cutbacks on overall budgetary allocations to the NA and AJK, and within these, specifically to&#13;
education. A SAPP-type project is the logical framework for addressing these issues. Risks related&#13;
to political factors include interference in site selection for construction of schools and in teacher&#13;
appointments, as well as changes of Government, a possible flare-up of sectarian violence in the NA,&#13;
or a change in the overall status of AJK. The first of these two risks will be addressed through the&#13;
use of school mapping results for the rational selection of school sites and through the use of merit-&#13;
based criteria in the hiring of teachers. Over the remaining risks, of course, the project has no&#13;

Efficiency." World Bank, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
control. Given the high priority of improving education in these neglected areas, the risks overall are&#13;
considered acceptable.&#13;
D. Environmental Assessment&#13;
4.15       No adverse impact on the enviromnent is expected from this project (screening category&#13;
C). Some benefit is expected through lower population pressure, an increasingly literate population,&#13;
and the possible integration of environmental themes into revised educational materials. No&#13;
involuntary resettlement is anticipated, since land for school construction will be acquired through&#13;
voluntary community contributions, as verified through a "community dialogue" process developed&#13;
with the help of participating NGOs.&#13;

1.         Government spending on education has been extremely low in the Northern Areas (NA)&#13;
and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Low historical spending in the NA has resulted in low literacy&#13;
levels, poor education assets and low student completion and achievement. The strength of the&#13;
teaching force has declined during the past decade. The overall quality of education is low by any&#13;
standard, and both physical and human resources are thinly spread.&#13;
2.         A comparison of the education expenditures in AJK with those of other provinces in&#13;
Pakistan, reveals that the situation in AJK contrasts sharply with the greater focus attached to primary&#13;
and middle school education in the provinces. While AJK's share of elementary education in&#13;
education expenditures is about 37 percent, Sindh and NWFP are spending about 52 percent and 48&#13;
percent (1992-93) respectively in the primary sector alone. Punjab and Balochistan are earmarking an&#13;
even higher proportion (about 56 percent of the education sector resources) to the primary level.&#13;
Despite the fact that AJK has a more mature educational system with a higher percentage of children&#13;
at the more expensive secondary level, allocations at the elementary level still appear low. According&#13;
to the 1994-95 AJK EMIS figures, 93 percent of the children are in elementary schools, yet this level&#13;
receives only 37 percent of the education expenditures.&#13;
3.         The education sector expenditures in NA and AJK represent a small part of the total&#13;
Federal (GOP) expenditures--only about one percent in 1995-96. Both areas, however, rely very&#13;
heavily on GOP transfers for financing their expenditures. All funding for the NA--both development&#13;
and non-development, is allocated through the KANA/SAFRON Ministry. The AJK government&#13;
internally generated resources cover only 35 percent of its overall expenditures while GOP finances&#13;
the other 65 percent. In 1995-96, allocations to education amounted to about 20 and 24 percent of&#13;
total public sector allocations in NA and AJK respectively (development and non-development) (Table&#13;
1).&#13;

4.         During the past five years, Education Development Expenditures have increased in the&#13;
NA. Education Development Expenditures as a share of the NA Development Expenditures (ADP)&#13;
has fluctuated from 7.6 percent in 1992-93 to above 17.0 percent in 1994-95. The average share for&#13;
the period was 12.5 percent. While Development Expenditures grew at an annual average rate of&#13;
about 8.0 percent during 1991-92 to 1995-96, Education Development Expenditures increased at the&#13;
higher average annual rate of 20.5 percent. The share of Elementary Education Development&#13;
Expenditures in the Education Sector Development Expenditures rose from 45.8 percent in 1991-92 to&#13;
79.0 percent over the 1994-95 and 1995-96 years. The Elementary Education Development&#13;
Expenditures average annual growth rate of almost 50.0 percent for the five-year period, reflects the&#13;
increased SAP allocations to the sector (Table 2). These funds however, represent extremely small&#13;
and insufficient amounts when compared with the sector's acute needs.&#13;
5.         In AJK, Education Development Expenditures have declined in the recent past.&#13;
Education Development Expenditures as a share of Development Expenditures (ADP) averaged 14.0&#13;
percent in 1991-92 and are estimated at 8.4 percent in 1995-96 (Table 2). In fact, while Development&#13;

of Elementary Education Development Expenditures in the Education Development Expenditures,&#13;
however, rose from about 52.0 percent in 1991-92 to 62.3 percent in 1995 (fable 2). This is partly&#13;
due to expenditures financed under the recently completed OPEC project and the ongoing Flood&#13;
Restoration project.&#13;

C. Recurrent (Non-Development) Expenditures&#13;
6.           Recurrent spending on the elementary level is lagging behind the other subsectors in&#13;
both regions. Elementary Non-development Expenditures increased at an average annual rate of 14.2&#13;
percent in the NA, while Secondary (and College) Non-Development Expenditures grew at an annual&#13;
average rate of 16.7 percent. The share of elementary non-development expenditures averaged about&#13;
64.0 percent of the education sector non-development expenditures (Table 3). Despite the growth of&#13;
recurrent expenditures in the education sector in AJK, averaging 9.7 percent per year between 1991-&#13;
92 and 1995-96, spending on the elementary education level has also lagged behind secondary and&#13;
higher levels. Elementary Non-Development Expenditures increased at an average rate of 8.6&#13;
percent, while College Non-Development Expenditures grew at an average annual rate of 14.1&#13;
percent. The share of Elementary Non-Development Expenditures in the Education Non-&#13;
Development Expenditures declined from about 36.0 percent in 1991-92 to 34.7 percent in 1995-96&#13;
(Table 3). During the same period, the share of Secondary Non-Development Expenditures&#13;
increased.&#13;

7.         One of the most critical problems in the education recurrent expenditures is the dominance of&#13;
the salary component. In AJK there are virtually no budgetary provisions for non-salary inputs, such as&#13;
repairs, maintenance, instructional materials, and so on. Recently, a provision of equipment (furniture, sports&#13;
goods) amounting to Rs.35 million for 4,119 primary schools was included in the ADP. One of the reasons&#13;
for the high proportion of dangerous schools is the combined effect of poor quality of construction and the&#13;
inadequate allocation of funds for maintenance and repairs. In the NA, non-salary inputs in the elementary&#13;
education non-development expenditures have increased--they represented an average 4.5 percent of&#13;
elementary expenditures over the past five years; non-salary inputs totalled approximately 12.0 percent of the&#13;
elementary non-development allocations in 1995-96. This level of non-salary allocations needs to be&#13;
sustained.&#13;
8.         When compared with other provinces, per-student government recurrent spending at the&#13;
elementary level is very low, especially in AJK. Figures for 1992-93 show AJK with the lowest government&#13;
per-student recurrent expenditure in Pakistan (Rs.970) compared to Sindh (Rs. 1,314) and Balochistan&#13;
(Rs. 1,528). Per-student recurrent spending in the NA was about Rs. 1,277 per elementary student (equivalent&#13;
to about US$ 4 per month per student) and Rs. 10,316 per secondary student (equivalent to US$35 per month&#13;
per student in 1994-95 (Table 4). Low per-student recurrent spending is due for the most part to the lack of&#13;
non-salary government spending on maintenance, learning materials for students and teachers and other&#13;
educational inputs.&#13;

D. Financial Impact of the Project&#13;
9.         If the governments' current policy of focusing on improving the access and quality of&#13;
elementary education is to be implemented, the level of educational expenditures that would be needed&#13;
in the next few years will be significant. In the NA, a large proportion of the needed expenditures at&#13;
the elementary level, to be financed under the Northern Education Project (NEP), represent&#13;
investments in access and quality improvements which will have important pay-offs in the medium&#13;
and longer term, and without which the educational system will remain stagnant and call for much&#13;
larger investments in later years. Increased allocations to elementary education in AJK are also&#13;
necessary to make up for the low quality and the deficits in education "stocks"; low levels of spending&#13;
and continued focus on the expansion of education coverage have resulted in low student achievement&#13;
and poor education assets, such as inadequately trained teachers, dangerous and poorly maintained&#13;
facilities and lack of school equipment. Increased government financing allocated to interventions to&#13;
improve quality and equitable access, must be done in conjunction with efficiency improvements.&#13;
Efficiency will be increased by improving the utilization of existing resources through gradual&#13;
reductions in unproductive spending, and by increasing linkages with the community.'&#13;
10.        The share of education in the total ADP will need to increase over the next five years.&#13;
If the share of education development expenditures were kept at the current average of about 13&#13;
percent in the NA and 11 in AJK (Table 2), the program of improvements in the elementary level&#13;
would not be financially possible. The share of education in the ADP will need to be maintained at&#13;
an annual average of about 17 percent and 11 percent of the total ADP in the NA and AJK&#13;
respectively. This means that the education development allocations will need to rise at an average&#13;
annual rate of about 18 p2ercent and 17 percent in the NA and AJK respectively over the proiect&#13;
period (Table 5).&#13;
11.        The declining trend in the recurrent (non-development) spending at the elementary&#13;
education level needs to be reversed. In the NA, the elementary education non-development&#13;
allocations will need to increase at an average of 11 percent in real terms. Non-salary allocations&#13;
1 Efficiency efforts supported by the project include the application of merit-based criteria for&#13;
teacher hiring, gradually eliminating the practice of government financing of pre-service teacher&#13;
training for employed government teachers, and redeployment of staff to meet current classroom&#13;
needs or to strengthen quality inputs.&#13;

will need to be maintained at the 1995-96 level of 12.0 percent of the elementary education&#13;
allocations. In AJK, elementary education non-development allocations will need to increase faster&#13;
than for the sector as a whole, 11 percent versus 9 percent in order to make up for the recent&#13;
declines. Non-salary allocations, practically non-existent at present, will need to grow at an average&#13;
of about 28 percent (Table 5).&#13;
12.        The increases in the AJK and NA education budgets are proportionally large when&#13;
compared with the very low current allocations, but very modest in absolute terms. These are&#13;
marginal increases within the context of the total federal budget and would be financially viable. The&#13;
education sector development expenditures in NA and AJK represent a very small part of the total&#13;
Federal development expenditures--only about one quarter of one percent in 1995-96. The projected&#13;
education sector allocations (inclusive of the NEP project) required during 1996-97 to 2001-02 would&#13;
increase the above mentioned share to less than one half of one percent. Therefore, the increases&#13;
planned for the NA and AJK education sector budgets as a part of the overall budget are extremely&#13;
sm=all and well within the capacity of the Federal government.&#13;
13.        The NA Directorate of Education and the Department of Education of AJK have&#13;
provided policy statements (Annexes 4 and 5) which include, in the governments' own words, many&#13;
key reforms and commitments to increased quality and efficiency, equitable access, strengthened&#13;
planning and supervision activities and support to the participation of communities in education. Most&#13;
of these reforms are supported by the NEP and would only materialize if supported by increased&#13;
allocations to the education sector in general, and the elementary subsector in particular. The&#13;
government commitment to the provision of the additional budgetary resources above (which include&#13;
the resources being financed by IDA) will be confirmed at IDA-Government negotiations.&#13;
14.        With regard to the sustainability of project investments beyond the life of the project, the&#13;
level of recurrent resources required to sustain quality-improvement, institutional development, and&#13;
infrastructure investments is likely to be low. Increased involvement of communities in the&#13;
construction and/or maintenance of school buildings is expected to generate additional resources,&#13;
improve the communities' sense of ownership of an responsibility for school property, and preserve&#13;
investments over a longer time period through improved and more regular maintenance routines. The&#13;
heaviest potential burden on future NA education budgets may be the need for continued support to&#13;
community schools. Although it is the intent of the DOE to experiment with mechanisms to make&#13;
community schools virtually self-sustaining, this may not be a realistic goal, particularly in the&#13;
poorest communities. Nevertheless, even if the DOE were to have to assume the full cost of&#13;
additional financial support to a maximum of 800 schools receiving support under the project in the&#13;
form of a per-student subsidy, the yearly costs is estimated to be approximately four percent of the&#13;
total program budget in the final year of the program, or six percent of the recurrent (non-&#13;
development) resources during the same year. This level of effort is considered financially&#13;
manageable, and a relatively light burden given that community school enrollments are projected to&#13;
make up approximately 23 percent of total enrollments by the final year of the program. SAP/SAPP&#13;
policy and financial support (particularly with regard to recurrent budgets and non-salary spending)&#13;
are also expected to enhance project sustainability.&#13;

PAKISTAN&#13;
NORTHERN EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Community Participation and NGOs in the Northern Areas and Azad Jammu and Kashmir&#13;
I. Northern Areas&#13;
1.         Background. There are four main factors that influence the environment for community&#13;
participation in education in the Northern Areas. First, given their extreme isolation, rural&#13;
communities in the NA have developed a strong tradition of self-reliance. Second, government&#13;
services are limited, understaffed, and chronically underfunded, which has meant both that&#13;
communities have had to rely more upon themselves and that the government has had to find creative&#13;
and non-traditional ways to accomplish specific objectives. Third, community demand for education&#13;
is high; and fourth, there is a strong NGO presence in the form of the Aga Khan Development&#13;
Network (AKDN).&#13;
2.         The AKDN consists of four associated organizations, all of which receive some form of&#13;
support through the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF). The oldest of these is the Aga Khan Educational&#13;
Service (AKESP), which runs 126 schools in the Gilgit and Ghizer districts. Originally, these schools&#13;
were established as girls' schools in Ismaili communities. In more recent years, AKESP schools have&#13;
begun accepting boys at the primary level, as well as non-Ismaili children. AKESP schools charge&#13;
tuition and are generally considered to offer better quality education than government schools.'&#13;
These schools have had a strong effect on increased demand for education in general and girls'&#13;
education in particular in the NA, although AKESP has not opened schools out of the heavily Ismaili&#13;
districts of Gilgit and Ghizer. In terms of current organizational directions, AKESP is interested in&#13;
expanding its technical and training functions, but is not interested in assuming the burden of&#13;
financing or day-to-day management of additional schools.&#13;
3.         Other AKDN organizations include the Aga Khan Health Services, which runs clinics in&#13;
the Gilgit and Ghizer districts; the Aga Khan Housing Board (AKHBP), which for 12 years has run a&#13;
self-help school construction program in cooperation with local communities in the Gilgit and Ghizer&#13;
districts; and the Aga Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP), which has a 15 year history of&#13;
mobilizing local communities and forming village organizations (VOs) to undertake self-help projects,&#13;
including agriculture, water and sanitation, and microenterprise schemes. Unlike the other AKDN&#13;
organizations, AKRSP has worked in all five of the NA districts.&#13;
4.         Government-AKDN cooperation in the education sector has taken a number of different&#13;
forms. The Directorate of Education (DOE) and AKESP jointly established a Field Based Teacher&#13;
Development Program in the early 1980s, which has been offering locally based training to both&#13;
AKESP and government teachers since that time. The Government and AKESP have also informally&#13;
collaborated on school location decisions, with the Government essentially relying on AKESP to cover&#13;
I Tuition fees charged by AKESP schools are far lower than those charged by other "private" institutions, and&#13;
are heavily subsidized. Full and partial remission of fees is also available in AKESP schools for low-income&#13;
children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

a large percentage of girls' enrollment in the two districts where the organization operates. More&#13;
recently, the Government and AKRSP collaborated in designing the community schools model under&#13;
the SAP program.&#13;
5.         Besides the AKDN, there are a number of smaller NGOs and "welfare organizations"&#13;
active in the NA. A group known as Nonhuhal has started a number of schools in the Nagar region,&#13;
and the Jaber Bin Hayyan Trust runs another nine schools, the majority in Baltistan (Skardu). In&#13;
some of the wealthier communities (particularly those along the Karakoram Highway), groups of&#13;
parents and/or private entrepreneurs have set up their own schools on a fee-paying basis. The vast&#13;
majority of these are "English-medium" schools, in response to increased community pressure for&#13;
English rather than Urdu as the language of instruction.&#13;
6.         The Community Schools Program. In 1993, the federal government announced the&#13;
beginning of the Social Action Program, or SAP, which was designed to support basic health, water&#13;
supply, and primary education throughout the country. The actual design of interventions and&#13;
activities was left to the determination of each province or area, although SAP did carry a mandate&#13;
for increased collaboration with local communities and NGOs. The NA are one of the places in&#13;
Pakistan where this mandate was taken most seriously. As of 1994, the DOE was faced with a&#13;
situation in which no additional teacher posts had been authorized for the region since 1986, seriously&#13;
curtailing the ability to open new schools or even adequately staff the existing ones. AKESP had&#13;
expanded enrollments in existing schools, but was financially unable to open new ones. AKRSP,&#13;
meanwhile, with its close ties to the village organizations, was sensitive to a growing unmet demand&#13;
for education. The result was a joint AKRSP-Government proposal to use the SAP monies to&#13;
establish "community schools" in partnership with village organizations.&#13;
7.         Under the program, the government advertised the availability of funds to help&#13;
communities willing to start their own school. Once communities had expressed interest in response&#13;
to the advertisement, a series of dialogues were conducted with potential communities regarding&#13;
program guidelines and mutual responsibilities. The dialogue process is a technique developed by&#13;
AKRSP, and AKRSP local social organizers were frequently involved in accompanying the dialogue&#13;
process. Basic criteria for eligibility included the following: (a) all schools to be established were to&#13;
be either coeducational primary schools, or girls' schools; (b) schools would established only where&#13;
either: (i) no school currently existed; (ii) only a boys' school existed and parents were unwilling to&#13;
send their girls there; or parents were unable to send their children to a local school due to&#13;
geographical, political or sectarian constraints; or (iii) a school was available but did not satisfy&#13;
demand; (c) communities would have to provide a building for classes to take place; and (d) the&#13;
community would have to hire a teacher who met DOE criteria. DOE criteria for hiring teachers&#13;
included the stipulation that a female teacher must be hired over a male unless there is no female&#13;
meeting minimum academic criteria, which in the case of females was reduced to a grade 8 pass&#13;
(matric for males). For its-part, the DOE undertook to: (a) deposit a "grant" of Rs. 100,000 in an&#13;
interest bearing account in the name of the community, the interest from which (about Rs. 1,400 per&#13;
month) would help pay the salary of the teacher; (b) provide initial training for the teacher; and (c)&#13;
provide academic supervision. These agreements and responsibilities were incorporated into a Terms&#13;
of Partnership which were signed by community representatives and the DOE.&#13;
8.         The dynamism of the government-NGO-community partnership under the SAP program&#13;
is evident from the results thus far. Over approximately a ten month period (between January and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
October, 1995), 250 community schools were. opened -- a 55 percent increase in the number of&#13;
primary schools under some form of government auspices in the NA. Pressure from communities to&#13;
expand the program has been intense and depending in part on funding, an additional 125-250 schools&#13;
are slated to be opened before January 1997. As of project appraisal (March, 1996), enrollment in&#13;
the first 250 schools had reached 12,088 students, or approximately 16 percent of primary&#13;
enrollments in the regular government system.2 Of these new enrollments, almost 61 percent are&#13;
girls, and just under half of the teachers are female (compared with 14 percent female teachers in the&#13;
regular government system). Based on the positive experience with the community schools program&#13;
thus far, the DOE has made community participation a cornerstone of its educational priorities and&#13;
strategies for the future.&#13;
9.         Despite the substantial achievements of the program, both the current design of the&#13;
program and its fast pace of expansion raised a number of concerns and issues during the course of&#13;
NEP preparation. These include: (a) the financial sustainability of the initial grant given inflation;&#13;
(b) the inflexibility of the grant mechanism to shifts in enrollment; (c) the need to establish minimum&#13;
enrollment criteria; (d) the need to tighten site selection criteria, based on an objective information&#13;
source; (e) quality concerns, including teacher recruitment criteria, training and managerial support to&#13;
school committees; (f) clarification of the definition of "community school" in terms of management&#13;
and fee structures; and (g) further developing a long-term strategy with regard to government&#13;
responsibilities to community schools, eligibility for upgrading to middle school status, and so forth.&#13;
In response to these concerns, a team of different area specialists were jointly commissioned by the&#13;
DOE, the Multi-Donor Support Unit for SAP, and IDA prior to appraisal to conduct a review of the&#13;
program thus far and make recommendations for alterations to the program as appropriate. The&#13;
review found that by and large program criteria had been applied as originally stated, verified that the&#13;
program enjoys a high level of commitment on the part of parents, teachers, and DOE officials, and&#13;
made recommendations on a number of issues based on their findings. Recommendations from the&#13;
review were built into the final proposals for project policy directions and activities, as well as&#13;
revised program criteria (see below).3 Further adaptations are expected to take place in response to&#13;
further experimentation and ongoing monitoring and evaluation during the project period.&#13;
10.        Revised Program Criteria for Establishment of Community Schools. The review&#13;
team recommended that the original program eligibility criteria be maintained, with the exception of&#13;
the consideration previously given to sectarian and political barriers. Priority criteria for awarding a&#13;
community school would be:&#13;
(a)   villages with no school;&#13;
b)   villages with a boys' school but with barriers to co-education; or (b) school available but&#13;
inaccessible due to geographic barriers; and&#13;
2 Comparison is based on numbers available from DOE on primary enrollments in regular government schools&#13;
as of November, 1995.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
(c)  school available but does not satisfy demand (overcrowding).&#13;
11.        The review team further recommended that some additional information be gathered and&#13;
criteria be applied within each of these previously defined priorities. Additional information to be&#13;
considered in determining the long-term sustainability of the school as well as whether the above&#13;
criteria apply include:&#13;
(a)   data on the number of children, including those of school age, boys and girls in the&#13;
village, using the union council definition of a village;&#13;
(b)   data on the number of and distance to existing Government primary schools for boys and&#13;
girls, including community schools in the area.&#13;
12.        These data will be readily available once a school mapping exercise is complete; in the&#13;
meantime, however, efforts should be made to collect these data from existing sources (AKRSP,&#13;
District DOE offices) and use them in weighing applications. Recommendations for additional criteria&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   Establishment of a minimum enrollment level of 20 students if initial enrollment is&#13;
limited to the first three grades; 30 if school serves all five grades;&#13;
(b)   Limiting initial enrollment to grades LA, 1, and 2 for the first year of operation of the&#13;
community school. This would help ease the immediate burden of multiple classes on&#13;
space, teacher capacity, and DOE financial capacity to provide a second teacher.&#13;
(c)   Limiting total enrollment to a 40 student to one teacher ratio, unless the DOE is able to&#13;
increase funding to provide for additional teacher(s) on a graduated scale, or the existing&#13;
teacher agrees to operate on a double-shift system;&#13;
(d)   Setting guidelines for the provision of a space for classes to be held, with the minimum&#13;
acceptable being (14'x 24') in one or two rooms, to accommodate a maximum of 40&#13;
students.&#13;
(e)   Community agreement to manage the school in accordance with the Terms of&#13;
Partnership in writing. Part of this agreement would include the selection of a female&#13;
teacher, where a matric pass female is available and is likely to stay in the village&#13;
(already being applied).&#13;
13.        In cases where there are more qualified applications than can be funded, preference&#13;
would be given to districts with historically lower female participation rates. It should also be clear&#13;
to communities from the outset of discussions regarding possible DOE support for a community&#13;
school that the establishment of a school does not necessarily entail a guarantee of a school building.&#13;
The criteria for allocation of school buildings to community schools would be separate, and would&#13;
include information gained through a school mapping process to take place under the NEP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

14.        These recommended changes to the program as it currently stands were discussed with&#13;
the government, the review team, and IDA, and were broadly agreed among the parties.&#13;
15.        Support for Community Participation under the Northern Education Project.&#13;
Because community participation is so central to the overall DOE strategy for education, all proposed&#13;
components of the NEP support increased community participation in some form. Under the access&#13;
component, for example, it is proposed that all construction activities under the project incorporate&#13;
community participation. This strategy is expected to increase community commitment to maintaining&#13;
the newly constructed or reconstructed buildings, and is estimated to lower the total construction costs&#13;
by approximately 30 percent. In order to institutionalize efforts at encouraging community&#13;
participation thus far, the project is also supporting the re-designation of a Deputy Director post&#13;
within the DOE as Deputy Director for SAP and Community Mobilization. With regard to support&#13;
for existing and future community schools, the NEP would provide support in a number of forms,&#13;
including:&#13;
(a)   Training for community school teachers. In accordance with the program agreed&#13;
between the government and IDA, community school teachers would receive training&#13;
through the Field Based Teacher Development program along with regular government&#13;
teachers;&#13;
(b)   Self-help construction support for eligible community schools. Proposed criteria for&#13;
eligibility for building support are included in the community schools review, and&#13;
include: (i) justification for building based on school-age population, distance to nearby&#13;
schools, and enrollment levels, as defined through a school mapping exercise; (ii)&#13;
demonstrated ability of the community to run a school during a two year period,&#13;
ensuring minimum enrollment and continuity of the teacher; and (iii) willingness of the&#13;
community to enter into cost-sharing arrangements under the program. Approximately&#13;
450 community schools would receive permanent school buildings under the project;&#13;
(c)   Additional financial support to community schools. The project would include funds to&#13;
support community schools equal to approximately double the current grant amount or&#13;
an estimated per-student subsidy of approximately Rs. 60 per month, based on&#13;
assumptions regarding average enrollment and the rate of growth of community schools&#13;
(up to a maximum of 800). Financial support would take the form of yearly grants to&#13;
eligible schools. Eligibility criteria, grant amounts and funding mechanisms would be&#13;
agreed on a yearly basis with IDA as part of the Annual Plan. Grant amounts would&#13;
reflect differences in enrollment between schools, and could be used for, inter alia,&#13;
payment of teacher salaries, purchase of school supplies, and building rental and/or&#13;
maintenance. Separate funds have also been budgeted for ongoing maintenance of&#13;
buildings constructed or reconstructed under the project;&#13;
(d)   Social organization/mobilization training for Directorate of Education staff. Field-based&#13;
Assistant District Education Officers (AEOs) in particular would receive regular training&#13;
to enable them to work more effectively with village education and school management&#13;
committees, as well as with Parent-teacher associations (PTAs) in regular government&#13;
schools. Training content would include introduction to materials to be used in training&#13;
VECs and PTAs in basic school management techniques, including record keeping,&#13;
&#13;

monitoring and following up on student and teacher attendance, and handling of&#13;
accounts;&#13;
(e)   Launching of a Community School Development Project (CSDP) as agreed by the DOE&#13;
and AKESP. This pilot project will test different inputs, management structures, and&#13;
financing mechanisms in a small sample of community schools (10) as a means of&#13;
identifying alternative approaches to working with/supporting community schools.&#13;
These lessons would then be incorporated into the ongoing community school program.&#13;
(f)   Study tours and technical assistance. Although the NA are experimenting with the&#13;
establishment of community schools on a much wider scale than many provinces, there&#13;
are other experiences with community schools in Pakistan which might prove useful in&#13;
the further development of the community schools program. The project would support&#13;
three brief study tours to look at such models, as well as technical assistance from within&#13;
Pakistan and abroad to help in the development of the community schools program.&#13;
16.       Increasing Community Participation in Existing Government Schools. Encouraged&#13;
by the response to the community schools program, the DOE has also sought ways to encourage more&#13;
community involvement in existing government schools. A notification regarding the formation of&#13;
parent-teachers committees was recently issued, although further details regarding the membership&#13;
and responsibilities of these committees require further definition. The NEP would support&#13;
government efforts in this area through: (a) provision of technical assistance to help further define the&#13;
roles and responsibilities of parent-teacher committees; (b) social mobilization training for DOE staff&#13;
(which would be relevant both for work with community schools and for efforts to enhance&#13;
community participation in existing schools); and (c) development of a training package for teachers&#13;
and parents starting PTA committees. The project would also support increased community&#13;
participation through the construction component. All repair and rehabilitation to existing school&#13;
buildings would be done through a participatory model, and funds for building maintenance would be&#13;
gradually decentralized to PTAs.&#13;
17.        Role of NGOs. For the most part, the role of NGOs in the project would be one of&#13;
providing technical assistance and training, although NGOs directly involved in the provision of&#13;
educational services may qualify for support under the community schools program under revised&#13;
criteria. Both AKRSP and AKESP would be considered an integral part of the program, and would&#13;
participate in the Project Steering Committee. In addition, AKRSP would: (a) provide support in the&#13;
identification of communities eligible for receiving community school funding, increase awareness&#13;
among communities regarding program criteria; and to extent possible support the dialogue process&#13;
leading up to the signed Terms of Partnership between the Government and the community; (b)&#13;
provide social mobilization training for DOE staff; (c) in collaboration with the DOE (and AKESP),&#13;
develop training materials to be used with VECs, school management committees, and PTAs, and&#13;
train of Directorate of Education staff in their use; (d) to extent possible, provide technical support to&#13;
the DOE in training of VECs, school committees and PTAs. AKESP would: (a) help with the&#13;
expansion of field-based teacher training efforts through opening of additional government FBTD&#13;
centers, thus giving the government additional time to expand its own capacity; and (b) participate in&#13;
a pilot project to develop the community schools program through experimentation with different&#13;
management and financial mechanisms in a small sample of schools. Both organizations would also&#13;
participate in the ongoing monitoring of the NEP through regular contact with Directorate of&#13;

II. Azad Jammu and Kashmir&#13;
18.        Background. As in the NA, AJK has a strong tradition of rural communities&#13;
contributing labor and other resources to accomplish specific goals. The local government department&#13;
has long relied on community contributions of labor for water and sanitation projects, and to some&#13;
extent in the financing and construction of school buildings. Unlike the NA, however, AJK does not&#13;
have a history of NGO involvement as intermediaries in such schemes, nor does it have a base of&#13;
community or village organizations comparable to that developed by AKRSP in the context of the&#13;
NA, with the exception of a number of village-based organizations in the district of Poonch, started&#13;
under the auspices of the National Rural Support Program (NRSP). Several ongoing projects (the&#13;
Northern Resource Management Project, and the Neelum and Jhelum Valley Community Project)&#13;
have incorporated community organizing components, but a recent review of these projects found the&#13;
community development components at a very preliminary stage.4&#13;
19.        NRSP started up operations in the AJK district of Poonch in 1993. Nationally, NRSP's&#13;
objective is to foster a country-wide network of grassroots organizations which enable local&#13;
communities to plan and undertake their own development. A cornerstone of NRSP's strategy is to&#13;
collaborate with other agencies to utilize existing material and human resources. These agencies&#13;
include government departments, NGOs, international agencies, and credit institutions. Thus far&#13;
NRSP has formed 138 village organizations in the district of Poonch, but there are as yet no plans to&#13;
expand to other districts.' In addition to NRSP, AJK also has a number of welfare organizations,&#13;
which are mostly volunteer based and focus on a variety of social issues, from after-school programs&#13;
for youth to health care and adult literacy projects.&#13;
20.        The results of a limited beneficiary assessment exercise conducted in AJK during project&#13;
preparation revealed that there is significant community support for education.' Most parents&#13;
consider education to be important, and the vast majority send their children to primary schools where&#13;
available (this is true for both boys and girls). Distance to education (sometimes even very short&#13;
distances) is still perceived as a barrier to education, particularly for younger children. While parents&#13;
do contribute energy, time, and financial resources to their children's schooling, the assessment&#13;
confirmed that this is mostly done on an individual or ad-hoc basis. Parent involvement in and&#13;
contributions to schooling are higher in communities with an activist head-teacher or community&#13;
member; in most schools sampled, however, there was no formal or established mechanisms for&#13;
parental input into school issues beyond payment of the nominal school fees requested by the teacher.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 8 of 9&#13;
Parents and community members interviewed clearly expressed interest in and concern about&#13;
improving the quality of education available to their children. There were differences of opinion,&#13;
however, regarding who should be responsible for quality improvements (government or&#13;
communities), and the quality of contact/dialogue between the government and communities has&#13;
varied. Many parents cited the need for improvements to the physical aspects of the school. Some&#13;
also cited other problems, including non-availability of certain teaching specialties, political&#13;
appointments of teachers, corruption in local government departments handling building construction&#13;
matters, and a general lack of consideration of local community needs and preferences. One parent&#13;
expressed the opinion that the government and community members should sit down and discuss ways&#13;
to improve the quality of education, but that "the govermnent doesn't listen to us."&#13;
21.        Formation of School Committees under the NEP. The basic strategy for increasing&#13;
community participation in AJK under the NEP would be through the formation of school committees&#13;
at the village level. This strategy is consistent with a longstanding proposal for the formation of&#13;
village education committees under the Social Action Program (SAP) which has yet to be put into&#13;
practice in AJK. As part of the SAP Operational Plan for 1995-96, AJK proposed the formation of&#13;
village-level school committees as a means to encourage community participation in education. As of&#13;
November, 1995, a summary proposal concerning the formation of school committees had been sent&#13;
to the Government for approval. Although this proposal is still vague with regard to the specific&#13;
responsibilities of these school committees and lacks an implementation strategy, it establishes the&#13;
policy basis for further development of a school committee strategy.&#13;
22.        It has been agreed that issuance of a notification is unlikely to be sufficient to ensure the&#13;
creation of active school committees. Social mobilization of communities and training for DOE field&#13;
staff, teachers, and school committee representatives would also be necessary inputs if the idea of&#13;
school committees is to take hold. Given the difficulty of providing this type of training and support&#13;
to over 5,000 elementary schools in AJK, it was agreed that it would make sense to pilot the idea&#13;
with a small sample of schools under the NEP.7&#13;
23.        Under the NEP pilot, the process of school committee formation would begin in a single&#13;
district (to be selected by the DPIEE) and would involve both the training of AEOs (and through&#13;
AEOs, teachers) in community mobilization techniques and the training of newly formed school&#13;
committees in their responsibilities. Technical assistance (preferably through a contracted NGO or&#13;
private company) in coordinating the community mobilization effort would be provided to the DOE in&#13;
the form of a project coordinator with a strong background in training and social mobilization&#13;
initiatives. The community mobilization coordinator would be expected to divide his/her time&#13;
between on-site training of AEOs and school committees in the pilot district, and wider education&#13;
efforts and reporting functions at the level of the DPIEE (for example, the arrangement of two study&#13;
tours for policy makers and DPIEE and district staff to look at community mobilization efforts&#13;
elsewhere in Pakistan). To the extent that there are already other social mobilization efforts underway&#13;
I In light of overall cuts to the project post-appraisal, the decision was made to restrict the pilot to a single&#13;
diArict, rather than begin school committee formation in three districts as proposed at appraisal. If the pilot is&#13;
judged to be sufficiently successful at the time of the Midterm Review, it is hope that SAP funding may be used&#13;
to support an expansion to other districts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 9 of 9&#13;
in the pilot district, the project coordinator and district-level AEOs would be responsible for&#13;
coordinating with existing efforts to the maximum extent possible.&#13;
24.        Under the proposed design, the formation of school committees in the pilot district&#13;
would at least initially be done in conjunction with the reconstruction of dangerous and building of&#13;
shelterless schools under the project. The reasons for making this connection are threefold: (a) first,&#13;
the fact of an investment in physical infrastructure is likely to mobilize the community around the&#13;
school and school issues; (b) second, an organized school committee can help oversee the construction&#13;
process (although not necessarily the most technical aspects); and (c) one of the functions of the&#13;
school committee would be the ongoing maintenance of the newly constructed school, thereby&#13;
preserving the initial value of the investment under the project. In view of the fact that the Civil&#13;
Engineering Cell within the Department of Education does not have experience with community&#13;
participation in construction, the project would not necessarily follow a participatory approach to the&#13;
construction itself. As has been the pattern in the past, however, communities would be asked to&#13;
donate the land for the construction of currently shelterless schools. Other school committee&#13;
responsibilities would include: fundraising and administration of government matching grants for&#13;
school building maintenance and purchase of learning materials; decision making regarding school-&#13;
related investments or improvements; regular monitoring of student and teacher attendance; and&#13;
sponsoring an annual community meeting to discuss educational issues and the progress of the&#13;
school.'&#13;
25.        Schedule and Activities.  Since school committee formation would be linked to&#13;
construction activities under the project, committee organization in the field would not begin until&#13;
after the completion of the school mapping exercise six months into project implementation. The first&#13;
six months of the component would be dedicated to start-up activities, and wider efforts to familiarize&#13;
DPIEE and district staff with community mobilization concepts.9 Implementation of the pilot in the&#13;
selected district would be undertaken during the first two and a half years of the project. Assuming a&#13;
fairly even distribution of school construction between the seven districts, a minimum of 50 school&#13;
committees can be expected to be functioning in the pilot district by the time of the Midterm Review&#13;
of the project. A decision as to whether to continue the pilot in some form, expand it, or terminate it&#13;
would be made at that time.&#13;
26.        Role of NGOs. Given the relative lack of experience with community mobilization&#13;
techniques within the Secretariat of Education, technical assistance in this area will be an important&#13;
factor in the success of the proposed program. Either an NGO or a private firm with extensive&#13;
experience in community mobilization would be most appropriate for such an assignment. Because&#13;
local AJK experience would also be an asset, such an arrangement might be considered with NRSP in&#13;
Poonch, for example. The NGO contracted would be responsible for providing: (a) a component&#13;
coordinator, to work at the level of the DPIEE as well as in the field in the pilot district; and (b)&#13;
specialized short-term technical assistance if needed (for the design of training materials, for&#13;
example).&#13;
Additional suggestions for specific school committee responsibilities, membership, -and tenure were made&#13;
during appraisal, and can be found in the final version of the appraisal mission aide-memoire (May 1, 1996).&#13;
9 These are further detailed in the aide-memoire of the project appraisal mission (May 1, 1996.)&#13;

PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIES&#13;
IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION&#13;
SUMMARY-.&#13;
Today, more than ever, the people of tile Northlern Areas lhave expressed that education&#13;
is their greatest need. Thus, the edtucation priorities and strategies of (lie Northern Areas&#13;
reflect the Government's willingness to meet thc iteeds of its people, and to effectively&#13;
support clementary education throughout the region.&#13;
The socio-economic indicators in the Nortlern Areas are amongst the lowest in Pakistan.&#13;
The litcracy rate of 15 percent is dramatically lower than the nationial average of 35&#13;
-perent. Fcmalc literacy is a dismnal 3 percent compared to the male literacy rate of 24&#13;
percent. Within the Northern Areas, therc is extreme disparity from one district to&#13;
another and within districts. There ihave been no new or additional teaching posts&#13;
sanctioned for the Northcrn Areas sincec 1986. Access to quatity education has been low&#13;
due to the extreme remoteness of many valleys and villagcs. The Directoratc of Education&#13;
has clearly recognized these problems ancl is comminttidcl to addressing them with a&#13;
programmatic approach.&#13;
Tic priorities and strategies set forth lere provide the palh wlhich the Norihernr Areas will&#13;
take to mcct the needs of its people. The path is one which is consistenL with the faith&#13;
ideology and aspirations of this nation as a wholc. Il is a padt wh ich seeks to attain&#13;
universal enrollinent in eleme:ntary education for all school-agcdl children in the Northern&#13;
areas, particularly female, with increased community participation. In coijunction with&#13;
this objective, the Government has adopted thl following specific prioritics:-&#13;
I.   Improve the quality of edutcation in order to increasc learnini achievements and&#13;
completion rates in elementary cducation.&#13;
2.   Increase cquitable access in eccmenitary education.&#13;
3.   Strengthcn institutional capacity to plan, man.age, and supervise education&#13;
programs, and;&#13;
4.   Increase community participation awnd support to NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
These priorities are reflected in a mu3ii-facted stratcgy which addresses each and every&#13;
concern in the provision of quality elementary education. Specifically, the strategies are&#13;
designed to focus activities on providing access for femnales to clemlentary education,&#13;
improving the skills and techniques of thc tcaching force, and strengthtning the&#13;
management capacities of the DoE to cffectively deliver clementary education.&#13;
Through well-planned and effective implementatiorn, education will be carried forward&#13;
tihroughout the Northern Areas, providing access to quality edtucation as never before&#13;
witnessed in the region. And with access to quality clementary education for the people&#13;
of the Northern Areas, the coming g,eneration of citizens will be ablc to avail themselves&#13;
of opportunitics as never bcfore. experiencied. Throutgh planning, investment and&#13;
conscience, tile people of the Nortleri Areas will increase tlhe level of tlieir contribution&#13;
to Pakistan as a nation, helping to pave thc way for a iunified and peaceful future.&#13;
Thefollowino sets forth each educational priorities and the corresponding strategies which&#13;
the Govcrnment will pursue in the imnmrediate futlre.&#13;
Priority I: Improvino the quslity of elententary educution in order to increase&#13;
learning .achieveinents and completioni rates in elementary ecitucation.&#13;
The qtuality of elementary cducation in tite Northenr Areas compares as among the lowest&#13;
in the whole of Pakistan. Years of limitcd resources have prodtuced a system burdened&#13;
with teaclhers wanting for proper training in tcaching metlhodologies and contlent&#13;
knowledgc. a curriculum whichl does not promnole lcarniing ancd achievcnent, and an&#13;
assessment system  which focuscs less on ability and knowlcdige and more on&#13;
memorization. There is a backlog of approximately two tlhousanjd untrained Government&#13;
teachers in the Northern Areas. As a result, ltie sttudcnts of the Northern Areas have&#13;
suffered in the face of students from otlher regions in  2aklistan. both at the elementary&#13;
level and at higher, more competitive levels of ediucation.&#13;
Strategies:&#13;
To imnprove the quality of clemnentary education in tihe Norifern Areas, the government&#13;
will puirsuc the following strategies:&#13;
I . Expansion of a field-based teacher training nmodcl whichi will dceliver necessary training&#13;
in modern teaching techniques to leachers working in remote reginns of the Northern&#13;
Areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. Strengthening of the College of }d.ucation for women in Gilgit. and establishment of&#13;
a College of Education for womcII in Skardi, to offer greater opportunity for teacJiers&#13;
and educationist to pursue higher sludies in tile teaching rield.&#13;
3. Supporting distance education for feinalcs, particularly through the Allamna lqbal Open.&#13;
Univcrsity, so as to provide females with greater opportunities to pursue teaching&#13;
qualifications.&#13;
4. Adaptation of field-based teacher training conccpts and tcchniques into the syllabus of&#13;
the College of Education, is an effort Co improve the teaching technologies and&#13;
methodologies used in the classrooms. These concepts and technciqtues havc been proven&#13;
to bc the most useful and innovativc approach to education in the region, and have been&#13;
tried and tested for over Len years.&#13;
5. Improvement of thc curriculum to rcflect the needs of thie Northern Areas, including&#13;
multi grade learning approaches, gender-friendly texts, and local realities.&#13;
6. Improvcmcnt of the use of supplemenlary matcrials, audio-visual teaching aids, and&#13;
other devices to support classroom instzizctioii.&#13;
7. Inprovement of the assessment system to improve lihc rclcvance and efficacy of&#13;
examination processes. Thzis includes devoloping examinaiotis which truly tcst the skills&#13;
and abilities of students, and training tcachers ini examination procedures and techniques&#13;
of continucus assessment.&#13;
Priority 2: lncrcase equitable access in elementary edcicatioji.&#13;
Access to elementary education in the Northern Are;s is liimited bothl by geography and&#13;
capacity. Communities are disperscd so widrly that the costs of bluilding a school in eaci&#13;
area are prohiibitive. And in those areas where iltere are scihoois. enrollments exceed 39&#13;
students per classroom.&#13;
Strategics:&#13;
1. Commencemenlt of a school mapping exercise to accurately ascertain the needs of&#13;
education intervcntioins.&#13;
2. Strengthening of the community school initiativc slarted under the Social Action&#13;
Programme Primary Education Component, which provides funding for community-&#13;
managed schools in low-access arzas.&#13;
3. Initroduction of a co-education policy at the primary level in order to increase access&#13;
for girls at the primary level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79ANNEX 4&#13;

4. Repair and reconstnicdion of existing school facilities.&#13;
5. Construction of new classrooms oni a participatory, sclf-help basis in partnership with&#13;
communities throughout Ihe region.&#13;
6. Construction of two teacher training colleges for females, one in Skardu and one in&#13;
Gilgit, to increase the number of adequately traiined female teachers.&#13;
Priority 3: Strengthen institutional cap.tcity to plan, managc, and supervise education&#13;
programmes.&#13;
Currently, the administration and supervisioni for all goveniment educational institutions&#13;
from primary-to tertiary level, is the responsibility of the Directorate of Education. The&#13;
five district offices supervise at the district level. The central and district offices are&#13;
inadequately staffed and equipped and management is hiihly centralized, the instittitional&#13;
capacity-of the DoE to plan. manage, and supervisc edtucation programmes needs to be&#13;
strengthcned.&#13;
Strategies:&#13;
1. Strengthening the Directorate of Education, at ithe cOentral, district, and sub-district&#13;
level, through provision of additionall staff, coiliputir and commlunication equipment,&#13;
appropriate training, and increased recurrent bud-cl.&#13;
2. Dccentralisation of school supervision by increasing thc number of field officers and&#13;
providing them with additional role of supervision rather than inspection.&#13;
3. Increased female participation at the administrative and supervision level by allocating&#13;
posts to female officers.&#13;
4. Establishment of a Northern Areas E.dtcntion Ma,aacmen  Information System (EMIS)&#13;
to assist the DoE in better planning and management.&#13;
Priority 4: Increase community participation aid support to NGOs.&#13;
The community school initiative unider the Social Action Programme is a key to primary&#13;
education development in the Northern Areas wlhich will be expancied to provide greater&#13;
access to primary education. In addition to this programnc the DoE will work to&#13;
encourage communities to actively parlicipate in cdcca(ion at the local level. The&#13;
participatory niodel of eduLcation is further culhanced by the participation of community&#13;
based organizalions and NGOs. Several steps nieed to be taken in order to strengthen&#13;
community participation and support to NCGOs.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
It is admitted fact that education is the basic element to bring change in a society in&#13;
respect of economic, social and cultural development. Education plays a vital role in&#13;
prosperity of a nation. Investment in education, as compared to other sectors, is&#13;
considered to be more productive and having multi-fold retums. That is why education is&#13;
given full attention in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. At present, AJ&amp;K is leading other parts&#13;
of Pakistan in case of literacy rate which is 46%. The participation rate at elementary level&#13;
in AJ&amp;K is higher than thal "f other areas of Pakistan. Fortunately, the goal of Universal&#13;
Primary Education is coming within reach and in the near future the target of UPE will be&#13;
achieved.&#13;
The rapid expansion in setting up educational institutions was initiated in the&#13;
Seventies, and as a result, presently each village of the area has got at least one primary&#13;
school for children of school going age. This state of affairs can be declared as a&#13;
revolution in the education system of AJ&amp;K. Before independence (1947). the area now&#13;
comprising Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir was the most backward area having only one Inter&#13;
College, 6 High, 26 Middle and 250 primary schools. This sorrow situation has entirely&#13;
changed, and at present there are 4,373 Primary, 855 Middle, 439 High and 35 Higher&#13;
Secondary Schools. Besides these institutions there are 34 Inter Colleges, 29 Degree&#13;
Colleges, one University and one Board of Intermediate and Secondary E.ducation. As far&#13;
as teacher training is concerned there are IO Colleges of Education for Elementary&#13;
Teachers, one College of Education, one Agrotechnical Teachers' Training Centre, one&#13;
Education Extension Centre and Centre for Curriculum Development.&#13;
Educational reforms and comprehensive policy initiatives have been carried out&#13;
with the passage of time since 1947. The major objective set forth in policy documents&#13;
has been to increase the literacy rate and universalize primary education, which is essential&#13;
for a developing nation. The Government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has successfiil_X&#13;
tried to implement these policies and the results are encouraging in respect of UPE and&#13;
enrollment rates. But this is not an end in itself, several measures and initiatives are still&#13;
required to be undertaken for improvement and strengthening the expanded system of&#13;
education in AJ&amp;K. Elementary education which is, today, considered to be the right of&#13;
every citizen, is enjoying top priority in the educational set-up of the state. In spite of&#13;
maximum efforts to uplift elementary education, further steps for improvement and&#13;
strengthening of the system still need to be carried out. For improving, strengthening and&#13;

future planning of elementary education, it is necessary to determine certain priorities and&#13;
to carry them out.&#13;
Priorities for Improvement of Elementary Education&#13;
(a) Improving the quality of elementary education.&#13;
(b) Increasing access and retention rate at elementary stage.&#13;
(c) Strengthening institutional capacity to plan, manage and supervise&#13;
elementary education.&#13;
(d) . Encouraging community and NGOs to participate in school programs.&#13;
-Improving the Quality of Education&#13;
AJ&amp;K has made remarkable progress in providing educational access to its&#13;
children. As educational participation has expanded, it has become increasingly important&#13;
to focus on the quality of education provided by the schools. The fundamental meaning of&#13;
educational quality is that students master the knowledge and skills which they need to&#13;
become capable and productive members of society. In order for this to happen, all of the&#13;
human and material resources of the educational system must focus on the central activity&#13;
of education: the teaching and learning process that takes place in the classroom. The&#13;
Government of AJ&amp;K, therefore, is dedicated to ensuring that the curriculum provided to&#13;
students is designed with leaming in mind; that teachers are trained in effective teaching&#13;
methods and educated in the content of subject areas; and that student learning is assessed&#13;
frequently and effectively. To ensure that these goals are reached the following section&#13;
identifies specific problems in the quality of education, and strategies for addressing them.&#13;
General Problems&#13;
The following problems seriously affect the quality of education with the result -&#13;
that learning achievement of students at primary level is lower than the national average.&#13;
-  At present 23% of male primary teachers and 15% of male middle school&#13;
teachers are untrained, compared to 50% of female primary and 33% of female&#13;
middle school teachers.&#13;
-  Teacher Training Colleges (GCETs) need to be strengthened in terms of&#13;
physical facilities and specialized teaching staff.&#13;
-  Inservice teachers require support in teaching new curriculum and multi-grade&#13;
teaching.&#13;
-  Single-teacher schools need additional teachers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
- Specialized institutions in curriculum development (CRDC) and Inservice&#13;
Training (EEC) require increased level of resources for technical and&#13;
management capacity building.&#13;
-  Instructional materials need to be developed and utilized by the teachers for&#13;
effective teaching.&#13;
-  Specialized institutions for training and curriculum need to coordinate their&#13;
activities.&#13;
-  Techniques to assess student achievement need to be improved.&#13;
Strategies&#13;
To reduce the percentage of untrained teachers, maximum use of training&#13;
opportunities available at Government Colleges for Elementary Teachers (GCETs) will be&#13;
ensured.&#13;
-  Inservice training courses in integrated curriculum and other subject areas will&#13;
be offered both for primary and middle school teachers.&#13;
-  Posts of teachers under training at GCETs will be reduced and shifted to&#13;
single-teacher schools.&#13;
-  Training packages, instructional materials and teacher guides will be developed&#13;
and distributed among the teachers.&#13;
- EEC and CRDC will be strengthened through the provision of additional staff.&#13;
equipment, technical assistance, and other resources.&#13;
-  Curricula for classes 4-8 with relevant supporting materials will be developed.&#13;
-  Training in textbook development and evaluation will be provided to&#13;
curriculum development staff&#13;
-  An Inservice Education Committee comprising personnel from the Directorate&#13;
of Elementary Education, GCETs, EEC and CRDC will be constituted to&#13;
establish effective coordination on training, curriculum development, and&#13;
examinations.&#13;
- Regional and international training and study tours will be provided to selected&#13;
people drawn from training colleges, CRDC and EEC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
85&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
The system of assessment and examinanans both for students and teachers&#13;
under training will be improved.&#13;
Posting and transfer of faculty members and the admission of students in&#13;
GCETs will be done with the consent of principals of these institutions.&#13;
Increasing Access and Retention Rate&#13;
Although participation in primary education is high, it is still the case in A1&amp;K that&#13;
many children do not successfully complete the full primary school cycle, and even fewer&#13;
enter and complete the middle school level. Several factors constrain participation and&#13;
retention of students in elementary education. In many cases, the physical environment of&#13;
the schools is not conducive to good teachingflearning practices. The Govemment is&#13;
committed to providing better physical facilities to address this need. At the same time,&#13;
Government alone cannot meet the needs for improvement. Commtnity involvement is&#13;
necessary to strengthen Government's efforts. Community involvement can also&#13;
contribute to improved access and quality in other ways. When parents and community&#13;
leaders take an interest in the schools, teacher peiformance rises and parental support for&#13;
their children's education increases. Community involvement can directly enhance the&#13;
quality and relevance of education, as schoois incorporate the talents and knowledge of&#13;
community members into the school program. Thus, the Government of AJ&amp;K is&#13;
committed to supporting theinvolvement of communities in the education of their&#13;
children.&#13;
General Problems&#13;
- About 28% of primary schools can be categorized as either dangerous or&#13;
shelterless. About 42% are in bad need of repairs.&#13;
-  Hardly any funds are available for basic repairs and maintenance of school&#13;
buildings.&#13;
-  Many schools do not have boundary walls and basic necessary amenities.&#13;
Strategies&#13;
-  To increase access and retention, new schools will be built, dangerous schools&#13;
will be reconstructed, and adequate facilities will be provided. In addition, a&#13;
school maintenance program will be established.&#13;
- A School Mapping exercise will be undertaken for assessing actual needs and&#13;
future planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
-New schools will be established on the basis of needs, and where appropriate,&#13;
co-educational schools will be built to increase cost-effectiveness.&#13;
- Female teachers will be preferred in the posting of teachers to co-educational&#13;
schools.&#13;
- Communities will be encouraged to participate in the construction of school&#13;
facilities.&#13;
- School Committees will be established to assist school administration in&#13;
solving school problems, including maintenance.&#13;
Strengthening Management&#13;
All improvements in educational quality and access rest on the ability of the&#13;
educational system to use human and material resources wisely in the present and to plan&#13;
for future needs. Good infornation and rational systems of postings and transfers underlie&#13;
effective educational management. Thus, recently the Directorate of Education (Schools)&#13;
has been bifurcated into a Directorate of Elementary Education -and a Directorate of&#13;
Secondary Education to improve educational efficiency as a whole, and in particular, to&#13;
improve capacity at the elementary level, and to strengthen school supervision.&#13;
General Problems&#13;
- Duties of AEOs, DDEOs and DEOs need to be streamlined to enable them to&#13;
visit schools more regularly.&#13;
- Supervisory jobs need to be well-defined and focused on improving the quality&#13;
of education.&#13;
- Staff posted in supervisory positions require induction training.&#13;
- Regular inservice training system for supervisory staff need to be developed.&#13;
- Supervisors badly need transport facilities.&#13;
- EEC and CRDC need more expertise in several specialized areas.&#13;
- Educational Management Information System (EMIS) cannot cater to the&#13;
growing needs of the educational system due to inadequate staffing and lack of&#13;
equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
87                          Page 7 of 8&#13;
Strategies&#13;
- Additional positions of AEOs will be provided so that an AEO may supervise&#13;
50 primary schools at the maximum.&#13;
-  An AEO will visit each school at least 4-5 times a year, and will have to follow&#13;
the list of minimum activities to be carried out, with emphasis on providing&#13;
professional guidance.&#13;
-  Female AEO staff will be appointed in positions occupied by male AEOs by&#13;
encouraging and facilitating female SSTs.&#13;
-  Job description will be part of the appointment letter for supervisors.&#13;
-  A policy on posting and transfer of supervisors will be followed.&#13;
-  Selection criteria for AEOs, DDEOs and DEOs will include: (a) experience of&#13;
elementary education; (b) basic qualification; (c) tenure of the post, etc.&#13;
Ultimately, the aim will be to create a separate cadre.&#13;
-  Performance of supervisors will be enhanced by providing: (a) induction&#13;
training; (b) transport facilities; (c) adequate budget according to the nature of&#13;
the work; (c) inservice training for supervising and guiding the teachers.&#13;
-  Taking the bifuircation into Elementary and Secondary Education to logical&#13;
end, middle classes will be separated from High/Higher Secondary Schools.&#13;
-  The Directorate of Elementary Education will be strengthened by providing&#13;
necessary equipment and transport facilities.&#13;
-  EEC, CRDC and EMIS will be strengthened in terms of human resources an-d&#13;
physical facilities. Mobile Training Unit will be established in EEC.&#13;
Increasing Community and NGO Participation&#13;
The majority of the people feel and even express that the problems prevailing in&#13;
schools cannot be solved with limited resources provided by the Government. The&#13;
potential of sharing responsibilities of schooling is emerging among the people, which can&#13;
best be utilized for promoting community participation.&#13;
The idea of community participation in school affairs in AJ&amp;K is not a new one.&#13;
During the past years people have involved in extending assistance in cash or kind for&#13;
establishing schools for their children. In certain areas where people are well-off, they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

provide the school facilities themselves. They take part in school maintenance and repairs&#13;
of classrooms and furniture.&#13;
Communities in AJ&amp;K are aware of the importance of education. This is why the&#13;
Government has responded to the demand of the people to establish schools and&#13;
consequently, at present, each village of the State has got primary school. In certain&#13;
villages people have established "Education Committees" in order to support and assist .&#13;
school management. Usually welfare workers and retired Government servants actively&#13;
take part in functioning of the Education Committees. The efforts from communities in&#13;
this respect need to be utilized in a structured manner.&#13;
Recently some NGOs and individuals have come forward in establishing schools in&#13;
the private sector. If NGOs and other interested people engaged in education are&#13;
encouraged and assisted, they can also contribute to quality education.&#13;
ffStraees:&#13;
To increase community participation, these measures will be taken.&#13;
- Widespread campaign will be launched to promote the concept of community&#13;
participation in educational programs.&#13;
School Committees will be constituted, and through legislation, their structure,&#13;
functions and responsibilities will be determined.&#13;
Training of the members of the committees and supervisory staff of education&#13;
department will be organized.&#13;
-  Education Councils at district level will be framed to monitor the activities of&#13;
School Committees.&#13;
-  With increased community interest in education, school facilities will be&#13;
constructed through participatory approach.&#13;
-  Greater involvement of private sector in education will be encouraged.&#13;

NORTHERN EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
I. Approach&#13;
1.         Monitoring and evaluation activities under the Northern Education Project (NEP) will&#13;
derive from and be integrated into the regular functioning of the educational administrations in NA&#13;
and AJK. The monitoring and evaluation plan comprises four modalities: (1) systemic monitoring by&#13;
education management staff; (2) special studies and reviews undertaken within project components;&#13;
(3) Mid-term review and final reviews; and (4) a baseline and end-of-project sample-based survey of&#13;
student achievement. Monitoring will primarily serve management functions while evaluation will&#13;
provide technical feedback and knowledge. In addition to the supervision required by the Bank, the&#13;
NEP will strengthen capacity in AJK's DPIEE and the NA's Directorate of Education (DOE) to&#13;
perform monitoring and to coordinate and learn from evaluation activities. Because the project&#13;
focuses on improving classroom quality, increasing equity, and strengthening community support to&#13;
schools, meaningful evaluations will require systematic, field-based study. The plan is to conduct&#13;
intensive mid-term and final evaluations of the project's impact on increasing access, improving&#13;
educational quality, strengthening management and increasing community involvement. Annual&#13;
evaluations will also be conducted in the NA. Due to low institutional capacity in the NA,&#13;
appropriate technical assistance will be provided.&#13;
2.         It is important that a project designed to raise school quality makes an effort to assess&#13;
the impact it has made on learning achievement. For this reason, an assessment will be made of&#13;
student achievement, using a criterion-referenced test, in the first year and final years of the project.&#13;
With all that is known about the long-term and cumulative nature of educational reforms, it would be&#13;
fool-hardy to take such a test as the sole determinant of project success or failure. At the same time,&#13;
it would be negligent to omit such a measure. At the very least, the effort will inform future projects&#13;
about the degree of achievement results that can be expected in a four-to-five year period.&#13;
II. Indicators&#13;
3.         Overall project impact will be inferred from specific indicators collected under the&#13;
access and quality components. In particular, these indicators include increases in enrollment and&#13;
gender equity at primary and middle school levels and increases in achievement among grade 4&#13;
students.&#13;
4.         Improving the quality of elementary education will be measured by increased&#13;
availability of learning materials, improvements in teacher qualifications and observed changes in&#13;
classroom practices, as well as by the achievement testing described above. The assessment of&#13;
classroom practices will be one dimension of mid-term and final project reviews, in which a sample&#13;
of classes will be observed for the use of multi-grade techniques, continuous assessment, and other&#13;
appropriate pedagogical techniques. The final review will be reinforced by a special study undertaken&#13;
by the CRDC in AJK, under the curriculum subcomponent, of the effectiveness of alternative modes&#13;
of delivering learning materials. In the NA, the annual evaluation in 1999/200 will include a focus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
90&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
on teacher training. The 2000/2001 evaluation will include an in-depth assessment of&#13;
teaching/learning processes. A sample of classes will be observed for the use of multi-grade&#13;
techniques, continuous assessment, and other appropriate pedagogical techniques. The final review&#13;
will also analyze current classroom practices.&#13;
5.         Increasing equitable access will be monitored through annual calculations of&#13;
enrollment, progression and completion rates, by gender, on a district and region-wide basis.&#13;
Baseline data will be reaffirmed through the school-mapping exercise. The strengthening of EMIS&#13;
will allow for regular access to this data. The first annual evaluation exercise in the NA, in&#13;
1998/1999, will focus on establishing access baselines and ensuring that EMIS is able to monitor&#13;
trends accurately.&#13;
6.         Success in strengthening institutional capacity will be indicated, in part, by the timely&#13;
conduct of program activities, including monitoring and evaluation activities. Underlying&#13;
management reform in the NA and AJK is the clear definition of management responsibilities. Thus,&#13;
the existence of job descriptions will be one piece of evidence that the system is being strengthened.&#13;
Because institutional strengthening determines the effectiveness of the project as a whole, the NA&#13;
annual evaluation in 1999/2000 will focus on the status of institutional capacity building at central and&#13;
district levels. The 2001/2002 review will assess progress in management strengthening in the&#13;
previous three years.&#13;
7.         Increasing community participation in schools may be the most difficult component to&#13;
evaluate effectively. Growth of community school committees gives a crude measure, but begs the&#13;
question of how effective community participation is in supporting and managing schools. The recent&#13;
review of the community schools program in the NA provides a baseline for evaluating their further&#13;
development, which will be a focus of the 2000/2001 annual evaluation. This will evaluate the&#13;
stability of enrollments and the teaching force in the community schools as well as improvements in&#13;
the quality of education which they offer. In AJK, the project will provide maintenance and learning&#13;
materials funds directly to school committees and the mid-term and final evaluation can assess the&#13;
effective use of these funds. Most expertise in community participation currently resides in the NGO&#13;
sector, and it may therefore be wise to include a community organizer in the field reviews, while at&#13;
the same time involving civil servants whose purview includes community development.&#13;

IV. Sources of NA Indicators&#13;
(a) Increasing equitable access&#13;
8.         NEP will support the development of an EMIS system for NA, from which access data&#13;
can be derived. Because the EMIS will only begin functioning in 1998/1999, the program will have&#13;
to rely on simple access indicators. These are: (i) enrollments in primary and middle schools, by&#13;
gender and district; (ii) percent of girls in elementary school; and (iii) classwise progression in&#13;
primary school. Baselines for the first two indicators have been estimated and will be revised in the&#13;
school mapping exercise undertaken in the first year of the program. Classwise progression rates can&#13;
only be estimated with successive years of data. Thus, in 1999/2000, it will be possible to determine&#13;
progression from Katchi to class 1, and in 2000/2001, from class 1 to class 2. Given evidence of&#13;
high dropouts in the early years, these statistics provide a good beginning for understanding trends in&#13;
educational attainment in NA.&#13;
(b) Improving quality&#13;
9.         Educational evaluators have long struggled with the question of how to assess school&#13;
quality, particularly in quantifiable terms. Three types of indicators of quality will be employed in&#13;
this project. The most readily available indicators are those that deal with system inputs that are&#13;
presumed to affect quality, such as the conditions of school facilities, the presence of textbooks and&#13;
the percent of qualified teachers. Student mastery of knowledge and skills derives from the&#13;
teaching/learning processes that take place in the schools. Thus, the program will support baseline&#13;
and end-of-project assessments of learning achievement in order to determine program impacts on&#13;
quality. The following set of indicators will be used for evaluating improved educational quality: (i)&#13;
percent of certified teachers (input); (ii) percent of teachers receiving FBTD (input); (iii) teacher use&#13;
of learning material (process); (iv) teacher use of multigrade techniques, continuous assessment, and&#13;
other active pedagogical skills (process); (v) learning achievement of teachers (impact); and (vi)&#13;
learning achievement of students (impact).&#13;
10.        Indicator (i) can be calculated from EMIS data, which will include the number of&#13;
teachers holding PTC, CT, BEd, MEd, or no teaching qualifications. It is important that the EMIS&#13;
questionnaire be designed so that teachers are identified by the level at which they teach, as well as&#13;
by type of school. Indicator (ii) will be derived by DOE from its data on FBTD training in relation&#13;
to the teacher data generated by EMIS. The process indicator (iii) and (iv) can be assessed only&#13;
through field-based observations of teaching/learning processes. Such observations will be a focus of&#13;
the 1999/2000 evaluations and final reviews. The impact indicators, (v) and (vi) will derive from&#13;
baseline and end-of-program testing of achievement among grade 4 students and teachers. The fourth&#13;
grade level is recommended for sample-based achievement testing -because improvements in the basic&#13;
literacy and numeracy skills are foundational to quality improvements. Because of the high costs and&#13;
implementation difficulties attendant upon population-wide testing, these assessments will be sample-&#13;
based. For reasons of cost-effectiveness and simplicity, the exams will cover only two subject areas,&#13;
Math and Urdu, which define literacy and numeracy. The technical skills required for such testing-&#13;
construction of criteria-referenced tests and sampling techniques--are as yet rare in Pakistan.&#13;
Therefore, substantial technical assistance (TA) will be required for this activity. At the same time,&#13;
emphasis on capacity building and local ownership dictate that this TA be integrated into the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
activity. Thus, the TA will work in conjunction with DOE departments of curriculum and&#13;
examinations.&#13;
(c) Strengthening institutional capacity&#13;
11.        All indicators for the component of strengthening management capacity are of a process&#13;
nature. The major indicators are: (i) percent of administrative posts with job descriptions; (ii) use of&#13;
EMIS data by administrative staff; (iii) timely completion of procurement; (iv) creation of annual&#13;
implementation plans by each implementing agency; (v) percent of activities according to plan; and&#13;
(vi) timely completion of monitoring and evaluation activities. The DOE has begun work on creating&#13;
job descriptions. It is expected that all administrative positions under the DOE will have job&#13;
descriptions by the end of year two. Indicator (ii), which gives a sense of the use of information for&#13;
planning purposes, can be generated by a simple annual report from EMIS on information requests.&#13;
The report should specify the source and nature of the request. Indicators (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) will&#13;
be generated annually in the project review and planning process in conjunction with Bank&#13;
supervision. The annual evaluations in 1999/2000 and 2001/2002 will focus on institutional&#13;
development. Because management capacity is central to the success of the program, early review&#13;
will enable necessary adjustments to be made.&#13;
(d) Increasing community participation&#13;
12.        The two indicators of increased community participation in education are also process&#13;
indicators. They are: (i) number of Village Education Committees formed; and (ii) number of Village&#13;
Education Committees functioning after two years. These indicators will be calculated in the&#13;
2000/2001 annual evaluation and in the final evaluation. In both years, community participation&#13;
specialists will also visit community schools and interview VEC members, teachers, and parents, in&#13;
order to assess the quality of education provided, as well as to identify any constraints to the effective&#13;
functioning of the community schools. The following table summarizes the specific components&#13;
which will be assessed in annual evaluations:&#13;

VI. Sources of AJK Indicators&#13;
(a) Increasing equitable access&#13;
13.        Three of the indicators for increasing equitable access can be derived directly from&#13;
EMIS and the fourth by combining EMIS with district-level data. The EMIS system in AJK collects&#13;
data on student enrollments, teachers and their qualifications, and physical facilities. The data is&#13;
collected annually in October and published in March or April. The following indicators of equitable&#13;
access will be calculated by the EMIS system analyst: (i) enrollments in primary and middle schools,&#13;
by gender and district; (ii) percent of girls in middle school; (iii) classwise progression rates, by&#13;
gender; and (iv) grade 5 completion rates, by gender. It is a simple matter for the EMIS system&#13;
analyst to extract the first two indicators and baselines already exist. The third and fourth indicators&#13;
to be derived from EMIS data, gradewise progression and grade 5 completion rates, by gender,&#13;
present greater technical problems. Absolute accuracy in this data would depend upon individual&#13;
student identification, which is beyond the capacity of the EMIS at this time or during the life of the&#13;
project. Progression and completion rates can be estimated, however, using methods of cohort&#13;
reconstruction. At a minimum, cohort reconstruction techniques require the calculation and use of&#13;
repetition rates. The EMIS questionnaire has, since 1994/95, included a section on grade-wise&#13;
repetition, by gender. EMIS staff report that nearly half of schools fail to fill in the section, with a&#13;
resulting loss of data quality. The verification of data process which will be built into the Institutional&#13;
Capacity component will ensure higher quality of this data. Whatever their quality, repetition rates&#13;
will only have been calculated for three years at the time of project start-up. Thus, the baseline for&#13;
the project will be grade three progression rates, or the percentage of a cohort which reaches grade 3.&#13;
In each subsequent year of the project, progression rates can be calculated for the next higher class.&#13;
A portion of the TA provided for strengthening EMIS should be devoted to the design of a simple&#13;
computer program enabling progression rates to be calculated on the basis of cohort reconstruction.&#13;
14.        The fourth access indicator derived from EMIS data, grade five completion rates by&#13;
gender, cannot be established until year three of the program. In this year, the progression rates of&#13;
students into grade five will be known. Completion rates will be calculated by the percentage of&#13;
students passing the grade five end-of-year exam. In order for this indicator to be accurate, students&#13;
sitting for the exam must indicate on their exam paper whether or not they have repeated grade five.&#13;
AEOs must be made aware of the need for this information and its use, so that it can be properly&#13;
explained to students and teachers.&#13;
15.        In the mid-term and final reviews, evaluators will conduct interviews with children who&#13;
have and have not completed grade five, and their parents, in order to understand better the reasons&#13;
for completion and non-completion. Rapid appraisal methods have been effective for eliciting such&#13;
information in other countries. The evaluation should concentrate on areas with low girls' completion&#13;
rates, which will be identifiable through the EMIS data.&#13;
(b) Improving the quality of elementary education&#13;
16.        Three types of indicators of quality will be employed in this project. The most readily&#13;
available indicators are those that deal with system inputs that are presumed to affect quality, such as&#13;
the conditions of school facilities, the presence of textbooks and the percent of qualified teachers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 8 of 9&#13;
Student mastery of knowledge and skills derives from the teaching/learning processes that take place&#13;
in the schools. The fundamental meaning of quality in education is that students master the&#13;
knowledge and skills conveyed in the curriculum. Thus, the program will support baseline and end-&#13;
of-project assessments of learning achievement in order to determine program impacts on quality.&#13;
The following set of indicators will be used for evaluating improved educational quality: (i) percent of&#13;
trained teachers (input); (ii) percent of teachers receiving INSET (input); (iii) teacher use of learning&#13;
materials (process); (iv) teacher use of multigrade techniques, continuous assessment, and other active&#13;
pedagogical skills (process); (v) learning achievement of teachers (impact); and (vi) learning&#13;
achievement of students (impact).&#13;
17.        Indicator (i) can be calculated from existing EMIS data, which includes the number of&#13;
teachers holding PTC, CT, BEd, MEd, or no teaching qualification. However, this indicator will be&#13;
more meaningful if a simple modification is made to the EMIS questionnaire. Currently, teacher data&#13;
is reported by t    of school, rather than level at which teachers are teaching. Because middle and&#13;
secondary schools include primary sections, it is not possible to sort out primary teachers--and their&#13;
qualifications--from the data. Adding two lines to the current questionnaire would solve this problem.&#13;
Indicator (ii) percent of teachers receiving INSET, will be derived by EEC from is data on INSET&#13;
training in relation to the teacher data generated by EMIS. In particular, EEC should track the&#13;
percentage of primary teachers which received INSET on the Integrated Curriculum. Currently, only&#13;
about 1 % of AJK's primary teachers have benefitted from this training. The process indicators (iii)&#13;
and (iv), can be assessed only through field-based observations of teaching/learning processes. Such&#13;
observations will form a second dimension of the mid-term and final reviews. Evaluators will&#13;
develop simple questionnaire for classroom observation and teacher and student interviews in order to&#13;
evaluate these processes. In a special study in the final two project years, the CRDC will examine in&#13;
greater depth the use of learning materials by teachers. The CRDC will also incorporate field testing&#13;
and monitoring of textbooks into their curriculum development cycle. These activities will contribute&#13;
to the evaluation of the curriculum subcomponent. The impact indicators, (v) and (vi) will derive&#13;
from baseline and end-of-program testing of achievement among grade four students and teachers.&#13;
T-he fourth grade level is recommended for sample-based achievement testing for two reasons: (i) the&#13;
curriculum for grades 1-3 will be delivered through already-existing textbooks; and (ii) improvements&#13;
in the basic literacy and numeracy skills are foundational to quality improvements. As in NA, these&#13;
assessments will be sample-based. For reasons of cost-effectiveness and simplicity, the exams will&#13;
cover only two subject areas, Math and Urdu, which define literacy and numeracy.&#13;
18.        The technical skills required for such testing -- construction of criterion-referenced tests&#13;
and sampling techniques -- are as yet rare in Pakistan. Therefore, substantial TA will be required for&#13;
this activity. At the same time, program emphasis on capacity building and local ownership dictate&#13;
that this TA be integrated into program activity. Thus, the TA will work under the auspices of and in&#13;
conjunction with CRDC, which is the institution responsible for development of grade-wise&#13;
competency lists. These competency lists provide the criteria on which the tests will be constructed.&#13;
(c) Strengthening institutional capacity&#13;
19.        All indicators for the component of strengthening management capacity are of a process&#13;
nature. The major indicators are: (i) percent of administrative posts with job descriptions; (ii) use of&#13;
EMIS data by administrative staff; (iii) timely completion of procurement; (iv) creation of annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
97&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 9 of 9&#13;
implementation plans by each implementing agency; (v) percent of activities implemented according to&#13;
plan; and (vi) timely completion of monitoring and evaluation activities.&#13;
20.        The DPI(EE) has begun work on creating job descriptions, beginning with the position&#13;
of AEOs. It is expected that all administrative positions under the DPIEE will have job descriptions&#13;
by the end of program year two. Indicator (ii) which gives a sense of the use of information for&#13;
planning purposes, can be generated by a simple annual report from EMIS on information requests.&#13;
The report should specify the source and nature of the request. In mid-term and final review,&#13;
evaluators can follow up on the reports by discussions with information users and non-users.&#13;
Indicators (iii) (iv) (v) and (vi) will be generated annually in the program review and planning process&#13;
in conjunction with Bank supervision.&#13;
(d) Increasing community participation&#13;
21.        The four indicators of increased community participation in education are also process&#13;
indicators. They are: (i) number of school committees formed; (ii) number of school committees&#13;
functioning after two years; (iii) effective use of maintenance funds; and (iv) effective use of learning&#13;
materials funds.&#13;
22.        Indicators (i) and (ii) will be routinely collected by the TA for community participation.&#13;
The same TA will provide input to the mid-term and final evaluations for determining indicators (iii)&#13;
and (iv). The terms of reference for this portion of the evaluations will specify that evaluators&#13;
determine, for a sample of school committees, (a) the level of community contributions to&#13;
maintenance and learning materials; (b) the specific purposes to which these funds have been put; and&#13;
(c) community views on the effectiveness of the school management committees in these two areas.&#13;
VII. Oversight of and reporting on monitoring and evaluation activities&#13;
23.        The sections above detailed specific means and responsibilities for gathering monitoring&#13;
indicators. In all cases, however, it is the responsibility of relevant offices in the DPI/EE and the&#13;
DOE to ensure that evaluation exercises are conducted and that the resulting information is fed back&#13;
into project planning and implementation.&#13;

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Implementation Timeline and Modalities&#13;
The project would be implemented over a five year period in both the NA and AJK, starting in&#13;
the first semester of FY1997-98 and closing on June 30, 2002. Although a detailed forecasting of&#13;
activities year-by-year has been done for project planning and costing purposes (and is reflected in Project&#13;
Implementation Plans prepared by the NA and AJK administrations prior to Negotiations), experience has&#13;
shown that flexibility in meeting overall policy goals and targets is crucial. The project has therefore&#13;
undertaken a more flexible approach in the use of Annual Plans to determine annual implementation&#13;
targets in support of policy goals.&#13;
Implementation Responsibilities&#13;
On a day-to-day basis, the Directorate/Department of Education would be responsible for: (a)&#13;
monitoring program costs and program accounts; (b) processing disbursement applications and keeping&#13;
track of disbursements of credit funds; (c) procurement of equipment and administration of contracts; (d)&#13;
placement and tracking of any local staff receiving training abroad; (e) monitoring program/project&#13;
implementation; (f) preparation of Annual Plans and periodic consolidated reports of the progress of&#13;
project implementation, with reference to agreed monitoring indicators. DOE structure, additional&#13;
staffing needs, and specific implementation responsibilities by objectives and components for both NA&#13;
and AJK are presented in the tables that follow:&#13;

PAKISTAN&#13;
NORTHERN EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Supervision&#13;
Primary responsibility for supervision arrangements would be with IDA's Resident&#13;
Mission in Pakistan. Program and project supervision would be conducted semi-annually,&#13;
with a full mission mounted only annually -- typically in April/May coinciding with the&#13;
budget approval cycle and the discussion of operational plans. IDA Headquarters would&#13;
provide supervision support on particular components of Bank-wide interest (such as the&#13;
development of the community schools program in the NA).&#13;
Annual supervision missions would: (i) require at least two weeks in the field; (ii)&#13;
require the services of specialists in education, school construction, management, finance,&#13;
and community participation; and (iii) review progress of program and project components,&#13;
as well as procurement, financial statements and disbursements, loan covenants and the&#13;
implementation of technical assistance. Specialized skill requirements would be added to the&#13;
missions according to the needs identified by previous supervision missions.&#13;
To aid the Pakistan Resident Mission in ongoing supervision tasks, funds have been&#13;
budgeted under the IDA credit for local consultants (third party) to assist in project&#13;
supervision tasks, including top supervision of construction. These consultants would be in&#13;
addition to consultants in procurement, disbursement, and accounting issues who would be&#13;
hired under the credit to train DOE staff in the setup and maintenance of systems acceptable&#13;
to IDA (budgeted separately). It is proposed that the same "third party" consultants might be&#13;
contracted to help on supervision of both the Northern Education and Northern Health&#13;
projects, resulting in some economies of scale with regard to travel, etc.&#13;
IDA supervision responsibilities would include those activities being carried out by&#13;
participating NGOs (including AKESP and AKRSP) as part of the project. Both supervision&#13;
and reporting arrangements in the NA would be made in tandem with DFID, so as to ensure&#13;
project cohesiveness and minimize the time burden on implementing agencies. DFID and&#13;
IDA would also coordinate with regard to approval of key technical assistance contracts and&#13;
appointments. Although the Government of Pakistan would be the legal Borrower under the&#13;
project, all parties involved in project implementation (including participating NGOs) would&#13;
be kept informed of any decisions by IDA pertaining to the project.&#13;

NORTHERN EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance (TA)&#13;
A. Technical Assistance for the Quality Component&#13;
1.         The Northern Education project will support the efforts of the Directorate of Public&#13;
Instruction/Elementary Education (DPIEE) in AJK to improve quality through investments in teacher&#13;
education, curriculum development, and assessment systems and techniques. Short-term in-service&#13;
training has in the past been offered by the Educational Extension Center (EEC), whose operations&#13;
have lapsed due to lack of funding. The program will provide technical assistance to the EEC in&#13;
three areas: (a) developing institutional capacity to plan and manage INSET; (b) expertise in specific&#13;
INSET areas, like multigrade teaching-; (c) technical expertise for developing in-service courses for&#13;
educational managers and supervisors, in a newly created Management Training Unit.&#13;
2.         Development of locally-relevant textbooks and learning materials is the second focus of&#13;
the quality component. The Curriculum Research Development Center (CRDC) has already&#13;
undertaken the development of texts for grades 1-3, which are now in use throughout AJK. Work has&#13;
begun on grade 4 texts, but has been suspended for lack of funds. The program will provide&#13;
technical assistance to the CRDC to: (a) further strengthen its textbook development progress; (b)&#13;
develop multi-grade teaching materials; (c) strengthen research capacity; and (d) contribute technical&#13;
expertise in specific areas of curriculum and learning materials.&#13;
3.         The assessment of student learning in AJK, as elsewhere in Pakistan, rests almost&#13;
entirely on end-of-year exams constructed with a weak understanding of testing techniques. The&#13;
program will provide technical inputs in two dimensions of assessment: (a) development,&#13;
administration and analysis of a sample-based test of learning achievement among grade 4 students&#13;
and teachers, in Math and Urdu; (b) training in the meaning and use of continuous assessment&#13;
techniques by teachers and teacher educators. Both of these activities will be undertaken in the&#13;
CRDC, with outreach to the EEC and teacher training colleges as appropriate.&#13;
4.         Technical Assistance is also being sought in the same three broad areas related to quality&#13;
of education in the NA. In teacher training, TA will support the implementation of an innovative,&#13;
field-based teacher training program (FBTD), and will provide training in specific areas of teacher&#13;
education. TA for curriculum development includes assistance to create and conduct training&#13;
workshops for textbook writers and to assist in reviewing and in field-testing new textbooks. TA will&#13;
also contribute to the development of multi-grade materials and the development of a guide for low-&#13;
cost teaching materials. TA for assessment will be in two areas: design and administration of a&#13;
criterion-referenced achievement test, and training in continuous assessment.&#13;
B. Technical Assistance for the Equitable Access Component&#13;
5.         For the Directorate of Education (DOE) in the NA to be able to implement the NEP and&#13;
function as a qualified client vis-a-vis communities, other government agencies, and external&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
121&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
consultants in areas associated with planning and development educational infrastructure, it needs&#13;
initial help and support to develop planning tools, establish capacity in several professional fields and&#13;
administrative routines, and generally enhance professional skills in order for the staff to be able to&#13;
meet the challenge successfully. The NEP would support the effort of the DOE to expand and&#13;
improve its professional capacity to plan and implement educational infrastructure, primarily in the&#13;
context of the program but also with a view to a long-term impact on the Directorate's capacity in this&#13;
field. This will happen in the form of: a) a revision of current type designs for elementary schools;&#13;
b) design and initial execution of school mapping; and c) training for DOE site engineers and village&#13;
artisans.&#13;
6.         Revision of type designs. The Project would support the development of revised&#13;
standard designs for elementary schools. These new type designs should respond to the particular&#13;
constraints and demands of the NA and be developed on the basis of accumulated experience gathered&#13;
by government and private agencies involved in school construction in the area. The work would be&#13;
awarded to a group of reputed architects and engineers with a proven capability to develop&#13;
educational facilities suitable for construction in a rural mountainous context with seismic activity,&#13;
climatic extremes, a human resource base with limited skills, and a limited selection of building&#13;
material available.&#13;
7.         School Mappin . The development of a capacity within the DOE to collect and process&#13;
such data, known as school mapping, is seen as essential in order for the Directorate to be able to&#13;
plan future investments in educational infrastructure efficiently, and the project would therefore&#13;
support the required development of data collection and planning tools and training of staff needed for&#13;
the execution of the associated work routines. In the future, this task will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Planning Department which will be sufficiently strengthened in this respect. In order to assist the&#13;
DOE developing one of the most essential tools needed for educational planning, the school mapping,&#13;
the NEP will provide consultancy assistance for the formulation, design, and testing of a school&#13;
mapping tool at the very early stages of project implementation.&#13;
8.         Training in School Construction and School-based Maintenance. The training associated&#13;
with construction of school buildings in partnership with the communities in the NA has the following&#13;
target groups: a) DOE project management and site supervision; and b) artisans and other skilled&#13;
labor in the communities.&#13;
9.         In order for the DOE to be able to implement the construction component under the&#13;
NEP in partnership with the communities, it will need to take on new technical staff in the Directorate&#13;
and contract field staff to be part of the community dialogue and to supervise construction&#13;
implementation. This staff will need to be trained in operating a system for monitoring and reporting&#13;
of construction progress, material consumption, expenditure, and quality control; and in working with.&#13;
community-based organizations. The consultancy shall assist the DOE in building its technical&#13;
capacity in these areas. This target group would include: One Senior Engineer; one Architect, and 15&#13;
site engineers and field coordinators. The actual construction on site would be carried out by artisans&#13;
and skilled labor from the villages where the schools are to be built. They would be nominated for&#13;
training by the community and selected by the DOE and the consultant in common and provided&#13;
training in specific aspects of skilled labor directly related to the construction of the standard type&#13;
school buildings built by the project. At later stages, the trained group of builders would themselves&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
122&#13;
ANNEX 1 1&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
function as master builders and trainers on other building sites. This target group would include a&#13;
total of 210 artisans from each of the following trades: masons, steel binders, carpenters, and 90&#13;
artisans each working as: painters, plumbers, and electricians.&#13;
10.        In AJK, the following support will be provided in addition to the construction of school&#13;
buildings: a) consultant support for a revision of the current standard type designs for primary&#13;
schools buildings; and b) consultant support for the formulation and testing of a school mapping&#13;
activity. The objective of the revision to the standard school design will be to develop type designs&#13;
which are responsive to the climate variations, are functionally efficient, need a minimum of&#13;
maintenance, and are cost-effective. The scope of work should include the development of a design&#13;
for a simple sanitary unit suitable for construction in environments with little experience in the use&#13;
and maintenance of modern sanitary facilities. In view of the limited experience with school&#13;
mapping and the associated physical planning process in the Planning Department of AJK, consultant&#13;
support will be provided. The objective of the support is to train and help the technical staff in the&#13;
Department in the use of collected data in the planning process associated with the identification of&#13;
school sites and deployment of teaching space. The input from the consultant will be made available&#13;
in two parts connected with the annual planning cycle.&#13;
C. Technical Assistance for the Institutional Strengthening Component&#13;
11.         Services of national consultants, one for supervision, monitoring and evaluation and the&#13;
second for accounting, procurernent and disbursement matters will be provided to the DOE in NA.&#13;
The consultants will help the DOE develop supervisory practices, evaluation systems, procurement,&#13;
accounting and disbursement procedures. The consultant for supervision/monitoring and evaluation&#13;
would work with the AD (Curriculum and Materials Development), AD (Teacher Training and&#13;
Supervision), AD (Examination and Assessment), AD (Monitoring and Evaluation) in DOE and&#13;
DDEOs/AEOs in the districts who are counterparts of these three ADs. National consultants would&#13;
also work with other consultants working on teacher training, examination, assessment, curriculum&#13;
and materials development. The consultant for Accounting! procurement/disbursement would work in&#13;
conjunction with AD (Procurement), AD (B&amp;A/Disbursement) and their counterparts in the districts.&#13;
12.        In AJK, institutional capacity will be strengthened by supporting the DPI(EE) with the&#13;
following TA: a) an international consultant and two local consultants to develop management&#13;
systems, procedures for procurement, disbursement, M&amp;E, keeping records, filing system, develop&#13;
necessary instruments and software packages to be used by the officers at Department level, DPI&#13;
level, district level and below district, EEC and CRDC and to train the staff in the use of these&#13;
packages; and b) study tours of selected persons from the DPI and district offices; and c) training of&#13;
DPI staff in computer skills.&#13;
13.        In addition, services of national consultants will be required to strengthen the EMIS&#13;
system in both areas. Consultants will help conduct information needs analyses, prepare&#13;
questionnaires for data collection, train computer and data entry staff, develop training materials for&#13;
data collection and decision making, and so on. The ultimate aim would be that the EMIS becomes a&#13;
timely source of basic planning information.&#13;
&#13;

D. Technical Assistance for the Community Participation Component&#13;
14.        In the NA, the community participation component will benefit from the experience of&#13;
AKRSP and AKESP. These AKDN organizations will be involved as follows: a) AKESP will&#13;
provide assistance in the FBTD program and the Community School Development Project; and b)&#13;
AKRSP will develop and deliver training workshops for AEOs and other DOE staff.&#13;
15.        The project will provide foreign and national technical assistance to the DOE for the&#13;
further development of the community schools program. The foreign technical assistance will be a&#13;
specialist in community school finance issues. The consultant will work in conjunction with a&#13;
planned visit by two local finance consultants under the AKESP's implemented Community School&#13;
Development Project. The DOE consultant would pay particular attention to the wider financial&#13;
issues currently facing the community schools program as a whole. Although the Northern Areas are&#13;
experimenting with the establishment of community schools on a much wider scale than many&#13;
provinces, there are other experiences with community schools within Pakistan that might prove&#13;
useful in the future development of the community school program. The project will support study&#13;
tours to different parts of Pakistan (Karachi, Balochistan, and NWFP) for DOE and AKESP staff&#13;
involved in the community school program.&#13;
16.        Given the relative lack of experience with community mobilization techniques within the&#13;
Department of Education of AJK, technical assistance in this area will be an important factor in the&#13;
success of the proposed program. An NGO or a private firm with extensive experience in community&#13;
mobilization would be most appropriate for such an assignment. The technical assistance would&#13;
consist primarily of a coordinator for community participation activities with a strong background in&#13;
training and social mobilization initiatives. The community mobilization coordinator would be&#13;
expected to d.ivide his/her time between on-site training of AEOs and school committees in the pilot&#13;
district, and wider education efforts and reporting functions at the level of the DPIEE (for example,&#13;
the arrangement of two study tours for policy makers and DPIEE and district staff to look at&#13;
community mobilization efforts elsewhere in Pakistan).&#13;
E. Monitoring of Technical Assistance&#13;
17.        The effective use of technical assistance is expected to have a significant impact on&#13;
overall project performance and longer-term sustainability issues. Given this fact, monitoring of the&#13;
technical assistance itself would form part of regular DOE annual reviews and IDA and DFID&#13;
supervision responsibilities. Moreover, the project Mid-Term Review would include a more detailed&#13;
examination of the role and performance of technical assistance under the project. While the&#13;
evaluation of technical assistance, particularly that geared to building institutional capacity, tends to be&#13;
fairly subjective in nature, some suggestions are made below for indicators/questions to be addressed&#13;
as part of both the annual and Mid-Term Reviews.&#13;

NORTHERN EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Economic Evaluation&#13;
A. Returns to Education&#13;
1.         It is well established internationally that education contributes to improvements in&#13;
nutritional levels and child health and to lower fertility. In addition, education contributes to growth&#13;
in incomes by raising productivity and to greater equality. Research for the World Bank's 1991&#13;
World Development Report suggests that increasing the average amount of education of the labor&#13;
force by one year, when this average is three years or less, raises aggregate real output by 9 percent.&#13;
2.         Difficulties with data collection and information for the NA and AJK, lack of data on&#13;
earnings in these regions and problems in valuing the broader social benefits that would accrue with&#13;
the NEP project, make formal cost-benefit and rates of return analyzes very difficult. However, rates&#13;
of return to schooling in Pakistan can be used as a proxy (Table 1). These rates are consistent with&#13;
other studies which indicate that: a) primary education has a highest rate (private and social) and&#13;
should be therefore the priority investment (a rate of return of 13 percent-the social rate for primary&#13;
education in Pakistan-implies that, with reinvestments, assets can be doubled in less than 6 years); b)&#13;
the returns decline with the level of schooling; and c) the private returns are higher than the social&#13;
returns. In sum, social and private rates of return for schooling suggest that investments in primary&#13;
education have high returns in Pakistan (Behrman, 1995).&#13;

public costs (but not social benefits beyond private benefits).&#13;

3.          Pakistan has foregone substantial economic growth because of the low schooling in&#13;
general, the low schooling of females in particular, too great concentration, of schooling at tertiary&#13;
rather than basic primary and secondary levels, and generally low schooling quality. As mentioned&#13;
above, beyond the economic productivity effects of schooling, there are important benefits--&#13;
particularly of female schooling--on health and nutrition, mortality and fertility. The total estimated&#13;
values of these benefits alone (ignoring economic benefits) exceed recurrent costs of basic schooling&#13;
of females (Behrman, 1995). Summers (1992) estimates the "net social benefits" of increasing&#13;
schooling in Pakistan in terms of mortality and births averted that suggest total discounted benefits&#13;
exceed recurrent costs. He states "it seems reasonable to conclude that the return to getting more&#13;
girls into school is in excess of 20 percent and may well be considerable greater...'.&#13;
4.         In addition, data from the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey (1991) confirm the&#13;
results above and suggest that education has an important effect on, inter alia: a) fertility levels, both&#13;
through increased use of family planning and delayed marriage; b) incidence of disease and&#13;
immunization; and c) children's school attendance. In Pakistan, the number of children born is&#13;
inversely related to both wife and husband's levels of education. Uneducated women give birth to an&#13;
average of 4.6 children, in contrast to 3.7 for women with primary education and 3.1 for women with&#13;
secondary education. Eighty one percent of children 5 years old and below with primary education&#13;
mothers were immunized, against only 70 percent of children with uneducated mothers. The&#13;
incidence of child diarrhea is lower for children born to educated mothers (particularly female&#13;
children). Finally, mother's education is an important predictor of school attendance: children of&#13;
educated women are equally likely to be in school, regardless of gender. In sum, education of girls&#13;
seems attractive compared with most alternative investments.&#13;
B. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis&#13;
5.          The overall aim of the NEP project is to improve quality and access of elementary&#13;
education, especially of female students. The design and preparation of the project were aimed at&#13;
developing the most cost-effective approach to achieving these objectives. In both NA and AJK,&#13;
where the needs are very basic and the system is rudimentary, the project would focus on improving&#13;
participation in schools, increasing learning achievements and improving the capacity to run the&#13;
system properly. The project proposes the most cost-effective package of investments in physical&#13;
infrastructure, teacher education, development of instructional materials and improved institutional&#13;
capacity, for the conditions of the north. A few examples of the different alternatives analyzed are&#13;
presented below.&#13;
6.          School construction. rehabilitation and maintenance. In order to achieve overall cost&#13;
efficiency and long term sustainability, construction under the project will be implemented with the&#13;
active participation of the beneficiary communities. In the NA, the Directorate of Education will&#13;
adopt a self-help strategy and work in partnership with the communities for the construction of their&#13;
schools. In AJK, the reconstruction of dangerous and building of shelterless schools will be done in&#13;
conjunction with the formation of school committees in the pilot district.&#13;
7.          The self-help strategy is based on a partnership agreement between the government and&#13;
the community, and has proven to have economic as well as social advantages. Benefits include&#13;
better quality construction and the resultant savings that accrue to both government and communities,&#13;
as well as greater willingness on the part of the community to maintain their assets. The alternative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
142&#13;
ANNEX 13&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
of utilizing the Public Works Department (PWD) for the school construction activities was rejected.&#13;
PWD is a government institution following rigid rules and procedures. In the case of school&#13;
construction, these procedures often fail to produce expected quality, on time, and at a justifiable&#13;
cost. Moreover, the PWD approach does not include community strategies and is very reluctant to&#13;
involve the user in the implementation process. In Table 2, the costs of a three-room school building&#13;
of sq. ft. 1,800, constructed by three different modalities are assessed. It would cost the government&#13;
Rs.833,000 and Rs.808,000, if the PWD or private contractors are used in school construction.&#13;
School construction with the self-help model would cost the government Rs.645,000, or about 21&#13;
percent less than the PWD/contractors alternative.&#13;

The community input will vary with the different types of structures, location and so&#13;
on (here it is calculated at 30 percent). The cost level is an average, based on a&#13;
location with easy access. It includes boundary, walls and sanitary units.&#13;

8.         The participatory construction process will have additional costs and benefits.&#13;
Construction in partnership with communities will, in some cases, take slightly longer time than if&#13;
implemented through a commercial contractor. In order to secure quality, it will also require training&#13;
of the community labor. This reduced cost savings can be justified because community involvement&#13;
will invariably establish a feeling of ownership and responsibility. The community will look after the&#13;
building after the construction. It will be much easier to establish a maintenance routine under such&#13;
circumstances than in cases where the work had been done by outsiders, without involvement of the&#13;
local people. By involving local artisans in construction, technical skills and knowledge would be&#13;
transferred and there would always be qualified people available to undertake the schools repair work&#13;
beyond regular maintenance.&#13;
&#13;

9.         In view of the fact that the Civil Engineering Cell of the Department of Education of&#13;
AJK dos not have any experience with community participation, the participatory approach to&#13;
construction will be different than in the NA. As has been the pattern in the past, communities would&#13;
be asked to donate the land for the construction of shelterless schools. In addition, construction will&#13;
follow the formation of school committees in the pilot district. The organized school committee will&#13;
oversee the construction process and will be in charge of ongoing maintenance of the newly&#13;
constructed school.&#13;
10.        Teacher Training. The project is also focusing on improving the teaching and learning&#13;
processes, in particular the quality of the teaching staff. In the NA, a large part of the investments in&#13;
teacher training is in the construction and staffing of two General Colleges of Elementary Training&#13;
(GCET) for women, which are badly needed, and in quality improvements at the male college. These&#13;
investments will create institutions which last long beyond the life of the project, providing a much-&#13;
needed service to the area.&#13;
11.        The other major investment in teacher training in the NA is in Field Based Teacher&#13;
Development (FBTD). This program is a model of cost-effective training for areas with great need.&#13;
It requires no investment in facilities, as it is conducted in existing schools and district offices.&#13;
Recurrent costs per training average $750, inclusive of salaries for substitute teachers and materials&#13;
which teachers bring back to their schools. The effectiveness of FBTD lies not only in its modest&#13;
cost, but in its intensive focus on practical skills. Half of the four-month training period is spent in&#13;
supervised teaching. With two Master Trainers supervising only 10 students, teacher trainees receive&#13;
far more effective guidance than in the standard, college-based practicum. Because of the low trainee&#13;
to trainer ratio, Master Trainers are also able to assist individual trainees in overcoming individual&#13;
weaknesses in content areas. Finally, the expansion of FBTD will also expand the pool of Master&#13;
Trainers, individuals who will go on to play key roles in the educational system of the NA. Their&#13;
own training, and the experience that they gain supervising teacher trainees in actual classrooms will&#13;
ensure that the administrative staff of the education system is in touch with the real needs of its&#13;
teaching force.&#13;
12.        In AJK, the project will focus on the institutionalization of an in-service teacher training&#13;
program (INSET) through the EEC as a means for knowledge and skills upgrading.' INSET courses&#13;
are very modest in overall cost, with recurrent costs averaging well under Rs. 1,000 per trainee,&#13;
including the provision of materials. If done well, INSET can provide an enormous boost to quality&#13;
in the teaching/learning process. The effectiveness of INSET rests fundamentally on the quality of&#13;
the course and its relevance to teachers. Thus, the program supports improved capacity in the EEC&#13;
for determining teacher needs and training and TA to strengthen technical expertise.&#13;
13.        Community Schools Program. Several alternatives for increasing equitable access were&#13;
considered during project preparation. Recent research in Pakistan confirmed that many private and&#13;
NGO-run schools outperform government schools both in terms of student retention and achievement&#13;
levels, often despite a much lower level of per-student expenditure. Reasons for these results are&#13;
1 Support for four of AJK's 10 teacher training colleges was cut from the project post-appraisal in light of&#13;
overall cuts to the project. It is hoped that support for quality improvements and rationalization of AJK's pre-&#13;
service teacher training may be included under SAP.&#13;
&#13;

varied, but include evidence that teachers' attendance in private and NGO schools is more regular,&#13;
and that teachers tend to be more motivated. Increased parental involvement in school management&#13;
issues (whether in government or non-government schools) also appears to have a positive effect on&#13;
enrollment, teacher accountability, and ultimately on student achievement. Given this evidence, the&#13;
Bank in recent sector work has encouraged the Government to work in partnership with the private&#13;
sector, NGOs, and local communities as potentially the most cost-effective strategy for improving and&#13;
expanding educational opportunities.2 The project's support to the NA administration's community&#13;
schools program is very much in line with these recommendations.&#13;
14.        Faced with a large and growing unmet demand for primary education, the basic choice&#13;
facing the government (and the project) is whether to try to expand access to schooling through&#13;
traditional or more experimental means. The "traditional" method of expanding access in the NA has&#13;
normally involved getting authorization and a budget for a building, waiting (sometimes years) for the&#13;
building to be completed, and fighting for the authorization of a teaching post before the school could&#13;
officially be opened.3 Frustrated with the bureaucratic obstacles and delays associated with the&#13;
traditional method, the government in 1994 began exploring an alternative in the form of subsidies to&#13;
community-run schools. Because the program did not initially involve construction (communities&#13;
donated space for the school) or additional posts (the communities hired teachers according to&#13;
government guidelines), it had a significant advantage in getting children into schools much faster&#13;
than the traditional method.&#13;
15.        Community schools are also cheaper (at least to the government) than traditional&#13;
government schools, although how much cheaper is difficult to tell given the newness of the program&#13;
and the need to make and evaluate adjustments to the levels of government subsidy. As of 1994-95,&#13;
the estimated level of yearly-per-student recurrent expenditure for government primary schools in the&#13;
NA was Rs. 1,227. In contrast, in 1995-96, given the levels of enrollment and subsidy to community&#13;
schools, the per-student expenditure is approximately Rs.350. This level of per-student expenditure is&#13;
clearly unreasonably low, however, if a minimum standard of quality is to be maintained. Under the&#13;
project, it is proposed to increase the level of funding to community schools such that the yearly per-&#13;
student expenditure would be approximately Rs. 790--still significantly less than that of regular&#13;
government schools, but sufficient to ensure a reasonable level of quality inputs.4&#13;
16.        With regard to the effectiveness of community schools versus traditional schools in&#13;
retaining and imparting learning to students, it is also probably too early in the program's life to&#13;
come to any firm conclusions. Clearly there need to be substantial investments in quality&#13;
improvements in both types of schools. As indicated above, however, evidence from other parts of&#13;
2 See Improving Basic Education in Pakistan--Community Participation. System Accountability, and Efficiency.&#13;
World Bank, 1995 (forthcoming in grey cover).&#13;
3 Until 1995, no additional teaching posts had been authorized for the NA since 1986.&#13;
4 Cost-effectiveness analysis should also look at the level of contribution of parents to the schooling of children,&#13;
in both community and traditional schools as part of the overall cost. Reliable data are, however, lacking, although&#13;
it may be presumed that the level of community/parental contribution may be higher in the case of community&#13;
schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
145&#13;
ANNEX 13&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
Pakistan indicates that where parents and communities are more involved in their children's&#13;
schooling, both enrollment and achievement levels tend to be higher. If the same is assumed to hold&#13;
true in the Northern Areas, then it seems reasonable to expect that, on average, community schools&#13;
will prove to be as or more effective a means of schooling than traditional government schools.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Northern Education Project's
            objectives are: a) to improve the quality of education,
            increase learning achievement and improve completion rates
            in elementary education; b) to increase access, equity, and
            retention of students, particularly girls; c) to strengthen
            institutional capacity to plan and manage educational
            programs; and d) to encourage greater community and
            nongovernmental organization participation. The project
            consists of four main components: 1) improving educational
            quality by instituting changes in teacher recruitment and
            training, developing curriculum and educational materials,
            and developing assessment capacity; 2) increasing equitable
            access -improving the quantity, physical quality, and gender
            balance of elementary schools operating in the Northern
            areas and Azed Jammu and Kashmir by rebuilding dangerous
            schools and erecting new school buildings for currently
            shelterless schools; erecting community schools buildings
            with community participation; and helping to establish a
            maintenance capacity in each school for receiving
            interventions to improve physical infrastructure; 3)
            strengthening the management capacity of the
            Department/Directorate of Elementary Education through
            organizational changes, providing limited additional staff,
            training, and technical assistance; improving the
            information base for planning and management decisions by
            conducting baseline studies, rationalizing information
            flows, and developing information management systems at the
            local level; and regularly monitoring and evaluating the
            proposed five-year program; and 4) supporting community
            participation in the Northern areas by supporting and
            improving the existing community schools program; and in
            Azad Jammu and Kashmir, by establishing school committees in
            existing government schools.
