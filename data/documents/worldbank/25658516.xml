provision, labor recruitment and training, access to logistics&#13;
and transportation services, and the ease of obtaining the&#13;
permits needed to start operations â&#128;&#147; can have a significant&#13;
influence on location decisions. In fact, some cities â&#128;&#147; such as&#13;
Bogota (Colombia) and Chennai (India) in the 2000s â&#128;&#147; were&#13;
able to focus their efforts on improving city-level conditions&#13;
and thus were able to differentiate themselves from a weak&#13;
national image.&#13;
&#13;
The focus of this paper is straightforward: What factors&#13;
do multinational firms consider when they make&#13;
decisions on where to invest, specifically in terms of&#13;
locating their manufacturing facilities and profes-&#13;
sional-services staff in a new city? And: What have&#13;
cities done to influence these location decisions?&#13;
&#13;
Since current literature has already covered extensively the&#13;
major determinants of FDI, this paper strives to comple-&#13;
ment the existing work by focusing on â&#128;&#156;the last mileâ&#128;&#157; of the&#13;

In this section, we examine how location advisors help                  ing position, e.g. acquire advanced technology owned&#13;

might employ slightly different methodologies, the general              and sharing within the industry. (For example: cultural&#13;
analytical process and rationale are remarkably similar. This           or historic tourism ventures, or the biotech clusters&#13;

within those frameworks. Examples of regulations, policies and administrative procedures at both levels include the following:&#13;

Some location advisors refer to this as â&#128;&#156;the 90â&#128;&#147;10 guidelineâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
in the location decision-making process, in which 90 percent&#13;
is about the fundamentals but a significant 10 percent is&#13;
about these softer factors, or perhaps â&#128;&#156;the last mile.â&#128;&#157;16 In the&#13;
last mile of the decision process, a cityâ&#128;&#153;s IPI can make&#13;
a huge difference. While IPIs also play an important role in&#13;
expediting the realization of some of the fundamentals (such&#13;
as putting roads, water and electricity in place), it is IPIsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
promotion, facilitation and marketing efforts that can often&#13;
help seal the deal. IPIs not only help cities stand out on a&#13;
firmâ&#128;&#153;s radar screen, but can also â&#128;&#147; once a few cities have been&#13;
shortlisted by the firm â&#128;&#147; help guide the firmâ&#128;&#153;s interaction&#13;
with local officials to influence the firmâ&#128;&#153;s final decision.&#13;
&#13;

   â&#128;&#156;Some city governments who try to attract&#13;
   â&#128;&#152;starâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#152;bigâ&#128;&#153; companies tend to fail when&#13;
   they do not understand their cityâ&#128;&#153;s core val-&#13;
   ue for the firms. Understanding their own&#13;
   cityâ&#128;&#153;s value proposition, being professional&#13;
   in information sharing and being honest&#13;
   about the operational risks that firms&#13;
   might face, tends to be more effective than&#13;

&#13;
Different cities have different characteristics, and therefore&#13;
they need to build up specific business propositions to attract&#13;
companies from a variety of economic sectors. However, no&#13;
city can compete in every sector. For example, in the case of&#13;
BogotÃ¡, after analyzing different options, the city decided&#13;
to focus its efforts on trying to attract investors from the&#13;
shared-services sector. The city seemed to have a competitive&#13;
advantage in the call-centers business: BogotÃ¡ was able to&#13;
provide an adequate level of well-educated and skilled labor,&#13;
and was able to provide the office space needed at compara-&#13;
tively lower costs compared to other domestic locations. Bo-&#13;
gotÃ¡ was thus able to take this sector to a higher-value-added&#13;
segment (i.e., IT services) when faced with competition from&#13;
other Colombian cities entering the call-center market. It&#13;
was also able to build up a strong offer to international firms,&#13;
allowing BogotÃ¡ to grow and progress up the value chain.&#13;

&amp;#12;6. Recommendations&#13;
We provide policy recommendations in this section, based on the evidence discussed earlier in this paper, to help cities attract&#13;
multinational firms to locate in their cities. There is no dispute that cities compete primarily on the basis of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s fundamen-&#13;
tals: their investment climate, their infrastructure, their labor skill sets, and the quality of their institutions. However, competi-&#13;
tion for FDI is fierce, and there is still a need for cities to go beyond the fundamentals.&#13;
&#13;
This section is especially relevant for secondary cities in developing countries that have invested in improving their fundamen-&#13;
tals but that still face limited success in attracting FDI. The table below highlights extra efforts that successful FDI-attracting&#13;
cities make. It also underscores some common mistakes that location advisors and practitioners say cities should avoid.&#13;

&amp;#12;Appendix 2: Deciding factors by MNC Sector&#13;
&#13;
Using the secondary sector (manufacturing) for example, locations in developing countries that have seen strong FDI inflows&#13;
also tend to have lower real exchange rate (i.e. cheap local currency), high FDI stock in the past, better labor-market flexibility,&#13;
better financial depth, and higher-quality infrastructure. For locations in advanced economies, strong FDI inflows in the&#13;
secondary sector are also correlated positively with high FDI stock, labor-market flexibility and infrastructure quality, but are&#13;
negatively correlated with judicial independence, financial depth and secondary-school enrollment.&#13;
