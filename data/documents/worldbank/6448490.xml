       This study presents the experience of applying the condominial approach to expand water and sewerage&#13;
&#13;
       networks in three contrasting Brazilian cities. It is based on the findings of a Study Tour to Brazil organized&#13;
&#13;
       in December 2003 for utility managers and public officials from the Peruvian water sector, who were in&#13;
&#13;
       the process of applying large-scale condominial systems in Lima for the first time. The goal of the visit&#13;
&#13;
       was to permit the Peruvian delegation to see mature and functioning condominial systems on the ground,&#13;
&#13;
       and to interact with local policymakers, utility managers, residents and specialists, to obtain better idea&#13;
&#13;
       of the challenges and potential advantages and disadvantages of implementing this system. The three&#13;
&#13;
       cities visited ­Brasilia, Parauapebas and Salvador­ were chosen for their contrasting urban settings and&#13;
&#13;
       specific experiences with the condominial model. The Study Tour was funded by the Bank Netherlands&#13;
&#13;
       Water Partnership Program.The current study is offered as a vehicle for sharing the results of the visits&#13;
&#13;
       with a wider audience of water-sector professionals.&#13;

  I. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The so-called condominial approach to the construction of                the block (under sidewalks, front yards or backyards), while in&#13;
water and sewerage networks was developed in Brazil during               the case of water they are generally located under sidewalks to&#13;
the 1980s as a response to the challenges posed by expanding             allow for individual metering. This design permits the adaptation&#13;
services into peri-urban neighborhoods. While the condominial            of the network to local topographic conditions and different&#13;
model has proved capable of meeting the considerable social and          urbanization patterns.&#13;
engineering challenges posed by these areas, it is also a generic&#13;
alternative to the design of water and sewerage systems. Indeed,         In addition, an integral condominial design contemplates the&#13;
the Brazilian experience illustrates how the model has been              decentralization of the drinking water supply or sewerage&#13;
successfully applied to urban neighborhoods as diverse as the            treatment facilities to avoid the costs associated with&#13;
Rocinha slum in Rio de Janeiro and the affluent Lago Sul and             transportation of fluids over long distances. This is in contrast to&#13;
Lago Norte districts of Brasilia.                                        the conventional approach, which emphasizes the concentration&#13;
                                                                         of fluids at a single geographical point. In the case of sewerage,&#13;
The term condominial is sometimes misunderstood, and it                  decentralization takes place through the use of drainage basins,&#13;
is therefore important to begin with a brief description of the          taking into account factors such as land availability and local&#13;
approach. The condominial water and sewerage system is based             environmental conditions. In the case of water, the exogenous&#13;
on two key concepts that differentiate it from the conventional          nature of water resources may limit the decentralization of&#13;
model.                                                                   treatment processes. Nevertheless, there may be opportunities for&#13;
                                                                         decentralizing storage reservoirs with a view to achieving greater&#13;
The first concept effectively redefines the unit to which service        uniformity of pressure in the entire service area.&#13;
is provided. Whereas conventional systems essentially provide&#13;
services to each housing unit, condominial systems deliver               The second distinctive concept behind the condominial approach&#13;
services to each housing block or any group of dwellings that            is the development of a much closer relationship between service&#13;
could be termed a neighborhood unit or "condominium." This&#13;
is similar to the concept of providing a single connection to an&#13;
apartment building, except that in this case the condominium is             Maintenance Equipment for Condominial Branches, Brasilia&#13;
&#13;
physically horizontal and institutionally informal. As a result of this&#13;
novel concept, the public network no longer needs to run through&#13;
every plot of land or to be present in every street, but merely to&#13;
provide a single connection point to each city block. Therefore, the&#13;
required length of the network is considerably shorter than that of&#13;
a conventional system. It needs about half the length for sewerage&#13;
and about a quarter of the length for water service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The household connections characteristic of conventional systems&#13;
running perpendicular to the network are replaced by condominial&#13;
branches running parallel to the blocks. Condominial branches&#13;
for sewerage can be located in the most convenient part of&#13;

agreement to facilitate service expansion and adaptation to local&#13;
needs and constraints. Thus, the condominium becomes not only&#13;
a physical unit of service provision, but a social unit for facilitating&#13;
collective decisions and organizing communal actions. Members&#13;
of the condominium must select the appropriate design of the&#13;
condominial service and commit themselves to complementary&#13;
actions ranging from sanitary education to direct participation in&#13;
the construction and/or maintenance process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the diversity of experience&#13;
within Brazil in the application of the condominial model and&#13;
to document the results to date. This is done by examining&#13;
three case studies chosen because of their contrasting urban&#13;
contexts and the substantial differences in the way the condominial&#13;
model was applied. The three cases presented are Brasilia,                one million people. In contrast to Brasilia, the condominial system&#13;
Salvador and Parauapebas.                                                 in Salvador was adopted in a gradual and experimental manner,&#13;

Although the issue of sewage treatment will not be discussed in          large size (100,000 inhabitants), plus the fact that it aptly typifies&#13;
detail in this paper, it is important to note that with the expansion    the group as a whole. Furthermore, the Santa Maria case has been&#13;

A further advantage was the free provision of land for sewage            density, occupying less than half of the city streets. As indicated&#13;
treatment facilities given that most of federal district the land        in Table II.1 above, this results in an average public network length&#13;

Adapting engineering aspects of the condominial approach&#13;
to Brasilia proved to be relatively straightforward thanks to a             Excavation works, Brasilia&#13;
&#13;
number of favorable characteristics of the local setting. First, the&#13;
local topography is relatively uniform, with slightly sloping gradients&#13;
well-suited to the drainage requirements of sewerage networks.&#13;
Second, the unusually orderly pattern of urbanization resulting&#13;
from the local government's housing program facilitated the&#13;
introduction of sewerage networks, whereas construction work&#13;
was made easier by the absence of roads and sidewalks in&#13;
much of the area. Third, the condominial approach was introduced&#13;
as a result of a conscious central decision, resulting in a coherent,&#13;
uniform application of the model in the federal district.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In order to illustrate the engineering issues that arose in the design&#13;
of the condominial systems, this paper will focus on the Santa&#13;
Maria system (Figure II.1). This system was chosen due to its&#13;

the total length of the system). An additional 26.5 kilometers of&#13;
the network (representing an additional 29% of its total length)&#13;
were rendered in pipes 150 millimeters in diameter, while a mere&#13;
2.7 kilometers of the network utilized pipes 250 millimeters&#13;
in diameter (in other words, no more than 3% of the total).&#13;
Conventional network design usually calls for a minimum pipe&#13;
diameter of 150 millimeters.&#13;

&#13;
Furthermore, pipes were buried at a depth of up to 1.20 meters,&#13;
but ensuring a minimum depth of 0.50 meters and allowing&#13;
the substitution of the traditional high-cost manholes with&#13;
simple inspection chambers. These accounted for 84% of                 Source: Mello, P.L. de (1996). Sistemas Condominiais de Esgotos e sua&#13;

&#13;
The condominial branches adopted not only in Santa Maria               established by CAESB and the local government permitted a&#13;
&#13;
but in all the condominial systems throughout the metropolis           great deal of flexibility. Three location alternatives were offered&#13;
&#13;
were required to conform strictly to standards of pipe location,       to the population: routing through the backyard, the front yard&#13;
&#13;
hydraulic capacity, material specifications and building regulations.  or the sidewalk (Figure II.3). The backyard option, and to a&#13;
&#13;
Few changes were made to the usual norms on hydraulic capacity         lesser extent the front yard option, had the advantage of being&#13;
&#13;
employed by CAESB and other Brazilian utility companies.               significantly cheaper to build due to shorter lengths and shallower&#13;
&#13;
To summarize: minimum diameter pipes of 100 millimeters                depths of excavation. However, the potential disadvantage&#13;
&#13;
(virtually throughout); minimum slope of 0.005 meters per meter;       is that they are inaccessible to utility company staff, placing&#13;

use of PVC pipes for sewerage systems; interconnections with           the responsibility for maintenance on the household. These&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
advantages and disadvantages have led to considerable technical         It is interesting to compare the preferences of the peri-urban&#13;
debate about the relative virtues of the different alternatives.        settlements with those of the affluent neighborhoods in the capital&#13;
                                                                        (Lago Norte and Lago Sul), which participated in the project&#13;
In the case of Brasilia, the final choice on the routing of the         beginning in 1997. The predominant choice in those areas was&#13;
branches was taken by majority vote at the level of each                for internal installations, particularly for branches routed through&#13;
condominium. Table II.4, for example, shows the choices finally         backyards. Pragmatism evidently played a role in this decision&#13;
made by the "condominiums" that were served by the condominial          given the existence of very spacious backyards, reasonably&#13;
system at that time (1996). These consisted of a universe of            favorable topography and especially residents' desire to avoid the&#13;
114,000 inhabitants in the peri-urban settlements (excluding the        costs involved in digging up and replacing expensive paved areas&#13;
more affluent neighborhoods of the capital). The population clearly     along the front of their plots.&#13;
was divided over whether to place the branches at the front,&#13;
the back or under the sidewalk. Overall, 51% opted for routing          In their various forms, the condominial branches of Santa Maria&#13;
under the sidewalk, while 43% chose the front yard. The                 covered a total length of 192.2 kilometers, which is to say&#13;
backyard was the least popular option, accounting for only              double the equivalent length of the public network. The network&#13;
6% of connections. While this decision was usually based                design incorporated 23,350 inspection boxes, equivalent to one&#13;
on weighing economic savings against the inconvenience of               inspection point for every eight meters of piping, which in practice&#13;
assuming responsibility for maintenance, in some cases choices          amounted to one box for each connection on the network.&#13;
were dictated by local topographic conditions or urban density          This provided plenty of access to the system for inspection&#13;
considerations. In some quarters, sidewalk branches were viewed         during the construction process, as well as for cleaning during&#13;
as conferring a higher social status.                                   subsequent maintenance.&#13;

The total cost of the public network amounted to US$1.7 million,          depths to be reduced.&#13;
whereas the cost of the condominial branches totaled US$2.8&#13;
million. The condominial branches accounted for 60% of the total          CAESB took great care to guarantee that the fee structure for&#13;
cost of the expansion. Given that these costs were covered by the         connection to and use of the condominial systems clearly reflected&#13;
beneficiary communities, this arrangement represents a significant        the relative costs of the different options and that consumers&#13;
reduction in the financial burden assumed by the utility company.         benefited fully from the savings associated with the lower-cost&#13;
At the same time, it is estimated that consumers paid no more for         choices (Table II.3). The connection fee was equivalent to the&#13;
the condominial branches than they would have had to pay for              actual average costs of constructing the infrastructure for each&#13;
conventional household connections.                                       type of condominial service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
With regard to the public network, the cost of one meter of               The connection fee for the three different types of condominial&#13;
network built equals US$19. This can be broken down into its              service ranged from US$47 (backyard) to US$84 (sidewalk) in the&#13;
constituent parts: 13% spent on inspections (inspection chambers          peri-urban settlements, and from US$123 (backyard) to US$256&#13;
and boxes), 19% on materials and 68% on laying the network.               (sidewalk) in the capital. This geographical differentiation reflects&#13;
These low costs reflect the advantages of the condominial model           the much larger plot sizes of the houses served in the capital,&#13;
(in terms of reducing network size, excavation work and keeping           necessitating a greater length of network per connection and&#13;

themselves under supervision by the utility company. In the latter&#13;
case, the beneficiaries did not have to pay the connection charge&#13;
but were expected to cover the cost of materials. About 1.5% of&#13;
the connections made under the program were constructed using&#13;
this approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, system use fees were differentiated to provide a discount&#13;
of 40% on the standard sewerage charge for households opting&#13;
for backyard or front yard condominial branches, and therefore&#13;
assuming the associated maintenance responsibility.&#13;

&#13;
II.5 Social Aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The success of the condominial approach in Brasilia was largely&#13;
due to the coherent discourse adopted by CAESB and the                       The process of social intermediation began with high-level meetings&#13;
local government authorities. From the beginning of the project,             in each of the localities, with the participation of community leaders&#13;
authorities carefully responded to the inevitable question: "Why             and senior representatives of the utility company.&#13;
substitute the existing system model for a new one in the&#13;
federal district?" Local residents were largely unfamiliar with the          The purpose of the meetings was to explain the condominial system&#13;
new system, whose lower cost seemed to denote lower quality.                 and to present the three basic options available for its design.&#13;
Authorities responded by providing a clear technical justification,          In addition, meetings were used to elect a representative for each&#13;
underscoring the political support for the system and promoting a            condominium, who was a key figure in terms of encouraging&#13;
consistent policy to apply the new model in the company's entire             sustained social participation, facilitating agreements among&#13;
service area. This last point was particularly important for avoiding        neighbors and inspecting the works. During the meetings, the draft&#13;
any potential perceptions of inferiority. The following excerpt from the     terms of agreement was circulated. Each condominium had to&#13;

    "The new model was studied by CAESB technical staff                      Great care was taken to transmit the concepts to the population&#13;
    responsible for the sewerage division of the company, and visits         in simple language, as well as to promote the exchange of ideas&#13;
    were made to localities where the model had functioned for a             among participants and to allot time for answering questions.&#13;

    promoted as a universally accessible system. It was approved             participants. The meetings always took place in the evenings&#13;
    at the technical level and accepted by all relevant authorities          in a location near the condominium (generally a school or one&#13;
    beginning with the governor. It was subsequently adopted as the          of the condominium houses). At least two individuals nominated&#13;

In spite of the inevitable disagreements that arise between           networks rather than have them constructed by the utility&#13;
neighbors, not one of the condominiums failed to reach                company, social inter mediation was more intense, often requiring&#13;
consensus over the appropriate course of action and to sign           additional meetings.&#13;
the corresponding terms of agreement. Nor did the consensus-&#13;
building process lead to any delays in the execution of the works.    II.6 Operational Aspects&#13;
Moreover, in general, the degree of mobilization tended to&#13;
increase with the number of meetings held. As the numbers             It is interesting to compare the different maintenance challenges of&#13;
attending meetings grew, time spent on clarifying doubts and          the condominial and conventional systems. Unfortunately, CAESB&#13;
seeking adherence to the program tended to diminish. In many          makes no distinction between the two types of sewerage systems&#13;
cases, people had had limited contact with their neighbors before     in its routine maintenance records, or at least not in a way that&#13;
the projects began, but this changed as the program progressed.       would permit rigorous performance comparisons. Nevertheless,&#13;
In effect, the project was instrumental in building social capital    Tables II.5 and II.6 below represent a specific effort by the&#13;

company to provide information on obstructions in the sewerage           length. These differences suggest that there are fewer maintenance&#13;
network. The first table covers a one-year period beginning in           incidents per customer for the condominial system, even while the&#13;
June 1996 for the western sector of the federal district, where          number of incidents per kilometer is quite similar.&#13;
approximately 60% of the condominial systems were operating&#13;
at the time. The second table covers the entire Brasilia network         A number of conclusions may be drawn from the information&#13;
for the period May 1997 to December 1998.                                provided in Tables II.5 and II.6. A general finding that emerges from&#13;
                                                                         both sets of data is that, in condominial systems, obstructions&#13;
When making comparisons between the conventional and                     are much more likely to occur in the public network than in the&#13;
condominial systems, two considerations should be taken into             condominial branches. Thus, the data show between 3.2 (Table&#13;
account. First, in order for such comparisons to be valid, it is         II.6) and 3.9 (Table II.5) times as many obstructions per kilometer&#13;
necessary to have maintenance data for incidents occurring in            of public network than per kilometer of condominial branches.&#13;
the household connections of the conventional system since these         There are two potential explanations for this: either the condominial&#13;
play a similar role to the condominial branches in the condominial       branches are less prone to obstructions, or the users are better&#13;
system. This information is only available in the case of Table          placed to resolve simple obstructions on their own initiative.&#13;
II.6. Second, maintenance incidents are reported per kilometer           Comparing conventional and condominial systems, the data show&#13;
of network. However, the condominial system serves the same              that the overall incidence of obstructions per kilometer is relatively&#13;
population with a shorter overall network length, therefore, simple      similar for the two systems, with the ratio for conventional versus&#13;
comparisons of incidents per kilometer of network will tend to           condominial ranging from 0.90 to 1.20. However, the data on&#13;
understate the difference between the two systems. Indeed, for           conventional branches, which are usually laid in the middle of&#13;
water service, the length of the condominial network is at most 25%      streets, show 1.7 times as many obstructions per kilometer as&#13;
of the conventional network length, whereas in the case of sewerage      condominial branches that perform the same function. Finally, the&#13;
the percentage is approximately 45% of the conventional network          time taken to perform repairs is roughly similar for the two systems.&#13;

As indicated above, the condominial model in Brasilia was               and understanding of the condominial approach. Furthermore,&#13;

II.8 Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Brasilia case illustrates the feasibility of applying the           Middle-class household in Brasilia&#13;
condominial approach on a large scale and obtaining substantial&#13;
cost savings without any adverse consequences for subsequent&#13;
operation and maintenance of the system. In its implementation&#13;
of the model, Brasilia was evidently favored by an exceptionally&#13;
orderly history of urban development. The successful application&#13;
of the model also reflects a number of wise decisions taken by&#13;
the local authorities. Moreover, the utility company made firm&#13;
policy decisions with regard to technology choice, communicated&#13;
these policies clearly to the public, adapted its internal structure&#13;
accordingly, and applied the new model in a non-discriminatory&#13;
manner in the entire service area. Furthermore, the utility company&#13;
provided residents with clearly defined alternative system designs&#13;
and ensured that the associated cost savings were adequately&#13;
reflected in lower user fees. All of these factors undoubtedly&#13;
contributed to increasing the acceptability of the model among&#13;
the general public.&#13;

During the first phase, the condominial model served to fill gaps      the full know-how to be transferred and absorbed. Instead,&#13;
in places where urbanization patterns effectively ruled out the        numerous amendments and adjustments had to be made on&#13;
use of conventional systems, for example, along rough tracks           a day-to-day basis as construction progressed. The various&#13;

Nevertheless, the system, though inspired by the condominial           they were considered necessary. While the main elements of the&#13;
model, did not constitute an integral application of this model.       condominial model were introduced in this piecemeal fashion,&#13;
A key difference was the absence of any clear delineation between      the overall result was that the procedures and standards forming&#13;
the condominiums that form the fundamental building blocks of          the backbone of the condominial system eventually prevailed.&#13;
condominial networks. As a result, the condominial branches&#13;
were almost always confused with the public network and there          III.3 Engineering Aspects&#13;
were either too many or too few of them used in the design of the&#13;
systems. In addition, local community participation was confined       The engineering designs used to adapt the condominial&#13;

The second phase began in 1994, when the Blue Bay program was          residences, "over-ground" pipes and the use of large vertical drop&#13;
implemented on a much larger scale. This period was characterized      pipes (tubos de queda) that will be described in greater detail&#13;
by the formal introduction of the condominial model, which             below. However, the condominial principles were applied only at&#13;

the condominial model was almost entirely confined to the highly       was based on the idea of concentrating the entire effluent of the&#13;
precarious urban slums, while use of the system in more typical        city at a single point where it could be discharged via a major&#13;

condominal principles and practices varied considerably among the&#13;
different contractors involved in the project.                           Household meter in Sao Caetano, Salvador de Bahia&#13;

&#13;
From 1997 onward, the condominial model effectively began to be&#13;
applied throughout the city, regardless of the type of topography,&#13;
style of urbanization or incomes of the populations benefiting from&#13;
the program. Indeed, the model would eventually be applied in&#13;
locations as diverse as the Bacia do Comércio (one of the oldest&#13;
and most traditional parts of the city, incorporating the historic&#13;
center) and the much poorer outlying peri-urban settlements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The essential dynamic was one of growing enthusiasm for the&#13;
system as its advantages became apparent in the areas where&#13;
it was first applied. As a result, there was insufficient time for&#13;

to centralize the sewage. An alternative approach that&#13;
was not considered --but which would have been more in&#13;
line with condominial principles-- was to keep the effluent&#13;
decentralized within the local basins and drain it into small-scale&#13;
treatment plants.&#13;
&#13;

The following discussion presents an overview of the engineering&#13;
designs, focusing on two specific and contrasting basins. The&#13;
first is Bacia da Peninsula, which is one of the oldest slums in&#13;
Bahia. It is characterized by low-lying land prone to flooding, and&#13;

In Bacia do Alto Camajuripe, the key engineering challenge was&#13;
&#13;
posed by the very steep gradient and dense urbanization, which&#13;
&#13;
frequently occupied the banks of local rivers and creeks. One&#13;
&#13;
advantage of the topography was the possibility of installing long&#13;
&#13;
stretches of pipes under the sidewalks, where the shallower depth&#13;
&#13;
meant that standard manholes could be replaced by much lower&#13;
&#13;
cost inspection chambers. Nevertheless, the nature of the terrain&#13;
&#13;
posed many other difficulties, leading contractors to develop&#13;
&#13;
a range of innovative approaches, which --while they diverge&#13;
&#13;
from standard practice-- illustrate a fundamental commitment to                                                      Channel&#13;
&#13;
meeting the needs of the population under any circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
There are four particularly noteworthy examples, namely:&#13;
&#13;
pressurization of the sewerage system; large vertical pipes; surface&#13;
&#13;
routing of sewers; and aerial networks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Pressurized systems. The typical sub-basins in this area have&#13;
&#13;
a semi-circular shape, with dense urbanization occupying the                                                   Pressurized&#13;
                                                                                                                    pipe&#13;
natural drainage areas along local creeks, where trunk collectors&#13;
&#13;
would normally be routed (see photo). Wherever space constraints&#13;
&#13;
prevented a traditional gravity-based collector from being installed,   Large vertical drop pipes. One of the sub-basins in this area&#13;
pressurization of the sewerage system was used as an alternative.       presented a further peculiarity calling for a unique solution.&#13;
This led to the installation of two independent concentric collector    This was the case of an area whose natural outlet consisted of&#13;
systems within the micro-basin, separated by a strip of land.           a ravine approximately 20 meters deep, the bottom of which&#13;
The higher one, which accounted for at least 80% of the total load,     was occupied by an informal settlement. The solution to this&#13;
discharged into a pressurized interceptor located on the available      problem was to use a vertical drop pipe consisting of a&#13;
narrow banks, making it possible to transport the effluent at a         150-millimeter cast iron pipe fixed to the wall of the ravine&#13;
minimal depth and slope. Further down, because of the narrow            with clamps, protected by concrete casing and ending in a&#13;
diameter of the condominial branches (almost exclusively 100            pressure-break box at the base, which also served as an initial&#13;
millimeter), the remaining 20% of the load, flows entirely by gravity   manhole. The sewerage network serves the informal settlement&#13;
until the junction where the effluents are collected and redirected     and the drop-pipe structure has functioned perfectly since it&#13;
&#13;

Surface sewers. In other parts of the basin, the natural&#13;

drainage channel between houses was so narrow that it could&#13;
&#13;
not contain normal stormwater flows without flooding the&#13;
&#13;
surrounding houses. The solution to this problem was to raise&#13;
&#13;
the level of the houses above the flooding level to permit&#13;
&#13;
construction of the collector above ground without disturbing&#13;
&#13;
the sewerage system of the abutting houses. The superficial                                                             Inspection&#13;

                              Collector                             EMBASA established general standards for the design of&#13;

                                                                  30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
by local hydraulic conditions in each case, EMBASA          Figure III.4: Illustration of condominial branch design in&#13;
limited the use of 100-millimeter pipes to the first 20     Bacia da Peninsula&#13;
&#13;
houses in any condominium, requiring diameters to&#13;
increase to 150 millimeters for the next 30 houses,&#13;
and 200 millimeters thereafter. These requirements&#13;
were driven by the deep-rooted cultural tradition of&#13;
combining stormwater and wastewater flows, which&#13;
raised concerns about using narrower diameters for&#13;
sewerage only. Furthermore, the general preference in&#13;
Salvador was for PVC pipes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Notwithstanding these general guidelines, in practice&#13;
there was considerable variation in the application of&#13;
the model, reflecting in part the diversity of contractors&#13;
executing the large-scale program as well as the nature&#13;
of the challenges posed in the different areas of the city.&#13;
In general, the depth of the condominial branches was&#13;
the minimum compatible with discharge requirements&#13;
from the dwellings, up to a maximum of one meter.&#13;
Furthermore, inspection boxes were placed at every&#13;
point of inflow, as well as at network junctions, and&#13;
near fall pipes in cases where vertical drops exceeded&#13;
0.5 meters. A key issue for the communities was the&#13;
adequate replacement of sidewalks and staircases that&#13;
had been damaged during the course of the installations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Regarding the location of the condominial branches,&#13;
there was general agreement that unconventional&#13;
routings would be adopted wherever local conditions&#13;
demanded. In some cases, this entailed routing under&#13;
steps and narrow alleyways between houses, via the&#13;
front or back yard, or even inside the houses. Given&#13;
the numerous technical restrictions on the network&#13;
design, the usual practice (observed in Brasilia) of&#13;
allowing households to choose the preferred routing of&#13;
the network had to be abandoned in Salvador because&#13;
there was only one viable alternative in each sub-basin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     31&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The other key consideration was the need to achieve (as far as&#13;
possible) a complete separation of stormwater and wastewater             Table III.2: Cost data for Bacias da Peninsula&#13;

With regard to the fees paid by the population, in the case of           Steep Change of Condominial Branch Level&#13;

Nevertheless, households were responsible for covering the&#13;
costs of internal installations required to re-plumb their sanitary&#13;
installations so that they drained into the new sewerage system&#13;
instead of the old stormwater system. EMBASA usually did this&#13;
work, and the beneficiary households and the utility company&#13;
agreed on monthly payments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Prior to the Blue Bay program, most households had some type&#13;
of drainage system since they were using the stormwater network&#13;
free-of-charge. With the installation of the sewerage network,&#13;
households had to pay for this service for the first time. In order&#13;

it difficult for local residents to determine which segments of      III.6 Operational Aspects&#13;

been handled better in a number of ways. On the one hand,            The gradual, unplanned approach that characterized the&#13;

greater efforts could have been made to inform local residents       adoption of the condominial model in the Blue Bay program was&#13;

         Sewerage pipe attached to wall, Sao Caetano,                over to EMBASA for ongoing operation and maintenance. There&#13;
         Salvador de Bahia                                           were no special efforts to train operational staff on the use of&#13;
                                                                     the new system or to adapt existing maintenance procedures&#13;
                                                                     to the different characteristics of these networks. As a result,&#13;
                                                                     the traditional operational practices developed for conventional&#13;

                                                                     as awareness of the new designs increased, adequate operation&#13;

                                                                     experienced with the city's conventional system, and reflect the&#13;

                                                                     history of combined wastewater and stormwater drainage, some&#13;

                                                                     the stormwater network. This led to several problems, including&#13;
                                                                     overload of the network during storms, as well as unwanted litter&#13;
                                                                     and earth flushed into the pipes by rainfall and the sedimentation&#13;
                                                                     caused by heavier materials settling inside the pipes. Second,&#13;
                                                                     the fact that less than a third of the population had connected to&#13;
                                                                     the network meant that sewage flows were lower than originally&#13;
                                                                     envisaged and therefore not always adequate to transport solid&#13;

                                                                     facilities to discard solid items, revealing deficiencies in their&#13;
                                                                     sanitary education.&#13;

III.7 Institutional Aspects&#13;
                                                                                 Gradients, Sao Caetano, Salvador de Bahia&#13;
&#13;
In contrast to the Brasilia case, the local utility EMBASA never&#13;
made any formal decision to officially adopt the condominial model&#13;
as a company-wide policy. Nevertheless, following the success of&#13;
the Blue Bay program, the system has subsequently been adopted&#13;
in dozens of small towns within the State of Bahia. The use of the&#13;
model can thus be characterized as much more opportunistic than&#13;
in Brasilia, and it has not been reflected in or absorbed into the&#13;
institutional structure of the utility company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Regarding the implementation of the Blue Bay program itself, the&#13;
large scale of the initiative, together with the five-year time frame,&#13;
meant that many different contractors worked simultaneously in&#13;
different parts of the city, including five or six of Brazil's largest&#13;
construction firms. When the project began, none of these actors&#13;
was familiar with the condominial model or with the socioeconomic&#13;
context of peri-urban slums. This caused that the adoption of the&#13;
model to be gradual and experimental, proceeding along different&#13;
parallel lines in areas managed by different contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
III.8 Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The case of Salvador de Bahia is probably the largest single&#13;
application of the condominial model. It is also noteworthy for&#13;
the enormous engineering challenges posed by the city and the&#13;
extraordinary ingenuity with which they were overcome. A key&#13;
problem in implementation has been the difficulty in convincing           the original rationale for the program. However, this problem is&#13;
local residents to assume maintenance responsibilities associated         not specifically related to the use of condominial technology, but&#13;
with the networks. The main failing of the experience has been            rather is indicative of a wider challenge affecting the expansion of&#13;
the low rate of connection to the sewerage network, undermining           sewerage networks.&#13;

The City of Parauapebas is a rare example of a well organized           increased to US$14.5 million) was disbursed to enable CVRD to&#13;

obsolete. Thus, by the early 1990s, they were deteriorating and         the network designs over to the condominial system with a&#13;
served only a small area of the city. In terms of water supply,         view to completing the project within the original budget. Once&#13;
only 1,000 residents occupying CVRD company condominiums                CVRD was convinced of the technical merits of the condominial&#13;

The feasibility study for the condominial system was based on             under half from the reduced use of materials, while in the case&#13;
the same design parameters as the original (that is, 90% service          of sewerage about one third of the savings would originate from&#13;
coverage with a provision of 250 liters per capita per day) and           the reduced excavation and the remaining two thirds from the&#13;
compared the contract prices quoted for the original (unfinished)         reduced use of materials. An additional advantage to the system&#13;
project to equivalent expenses for a condominial design (Tables           was that the cost savings enabled the financing of water services&#13;

Although the condominial model was applied to expand both               authorities, who preferred the easier system operation associated&#13;
the water and sewerage systems in Parauapebas, this case                with a high-pressure network.&#13;
study will focus on the study of the water system. The reason&#13;
is that while there are other examples of condominial sewerage          The resulting public distribution network covered 287 kilometers&#13;
systems in Brazil (such as the preceding case studies of Brasilia       of streets with a total length of just 43 kilometers. Given that a&#13;
and Salvador), application of the model to the water network is         conventional network would have been laid out along the full&#13;
comparatively rare and thus of special interest.                        extension of the urban road system, this represents a reduction&#13;
                                                                        of 85% in the total length of water mains needed to complete the&#13;
IV.3 Engineering Aspects                                                public water supply network, resulting in major savings in terms of&#13;
                                                                        reduced excavation, breaking and resurfacing of sidewalks, fewer&#13;
Following this decision-making process, the construction of the         materials, as well as a more minor, briefer disruption of urban life in&#13;
condominial water distribution system began.                            the execution of the works. The hydraulic capacity of this network&#13;
                                                                        complied with all Brazilian regulations applicable to networks of&#13;
(a) Public network                                                      this kind. The same was true for the location of component parts&#13;
                                                                        and accessories, such as valves for cleansing outlets at the lowest&#13;
By the time the construction of the condominial networks                points of the network, as well as closing valves for interrupting the&#13;
began in Parauapebas, the upstream construction associated              water supply at predetermined points for maintenance purposes.&#13;
with the town river-fed water supply reservoir was already&#13;
complete. This sequencing of events prevented an integral               More recently, the water distribution network has been further&#13;
approach to the design of the water supply and distribution             expanded to meet the demands of a growing population. In this&#13;
systems. In effect, the prior decision to build a single large          second round, it was possible to improve on the first-generation&#13;
reservoir imposed a centralized structure on the design of the          design, achieving additional cost savings as illustrated in Figure&#13;
water distribution network, which was not necessarily the optimal&#13;
one. For example, in some areas of the city that were not well            Installation of micro-meter in household connection,&#13;
placed with respect to the reservoir in terms of their relative           Parauapebas&#13;
&#13;
gradients, the maintenance of prescribed pressure levels&#13;
proved difficult. This is evident in the fact that the reservoir has&#13;
a median level of 205 meters above sea level, while about half&#13;
of the city is located below 165 meters above sea level.&#13;
The problem could have been avoided by adopting a more&#13;
decentralized design entailing a number of smaller reservoirs.&#13;
Given that this possibility had already been ruled out, another&#13;
alternative would have been to allow a lower pressure service&#13;
in some areas of the city by introducing pressure-break valves&#13;
or boxes, since this also would have helped to contain&#13;
distribution losses caused by the highly-pressurized&#13;
system. However, this solution was not acceptable to&#13;

                                                                      45&#13;

&#13;
The condominial branches for water were invariably routed along&#13;
the sidewalks. This is in contrast to the sewerage networks&#13;
described in the cases of Brasilia and Salvador, where branches&#13;
were sometimes laid within lots. The main reason for this difference&#13;
is the over-riding need in the case of the water service to ensure&#13;
individual connections to each plot for subsequent metering of&#13;
use. The condominial branches of the water network were placed&#13;
at an average distance of one meter from the front of the plots and&#13;
at a depth of approximately 0.40 meters. The branches were split&#13;
at the double-tee junctions placed along the network at points&#13;
coinciding with street intersections so that each was capable of&#13;
supplying water to up to two condominial branches (that is, two&#13;
urban housing blocks).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, the design called for the installation of both block        leading to a higher unit cost for the existing residents of the&#13;
valves and macro-meters at the entrance to each condominium.          condominium. It also raised the risk that the network capacity&#13;

One of the main problems encountered in the development of            did not assume any maintenance responsibilities in the case&#13;

The adoption of the condominial model in Parauapebas was&#13;

condominial systems still proved to be prohibitively high, largely      aspects of the works that would have been beyond the capability&#13;
as a result of the cost associated with the development of the          of the users to implement, such as determining the hydraulic&#13;

sacrificing the universal access goal, a proposal was made to           urban water supply standards were met so that the community&#13;

intermediation effort had been merely to educate the population&#13;
regarding the proper use of the new water systems. Nevertheless,        The third key decision was to implement a pilot project once an&#13;

took on the much more ambitious task of facilitating large-scale        the planning and execution of the approach within a limited area&#13;
community participation in the construction of the condominial          of the city. This had an important demonstrative effect that helped&#13;
branches. In that sense, the social component of the condominial        to increase support for the project and provided a true test of&#13;

                                                                   51&#13;

decline in meter coverage since 2000, which makes it more difficult&#13;
to detect and eliminate leaks. The second is the growth in illegal       Repaired Condominial Branch, Parauapebas&#13;
&#13;
connections after 2000, as unserved households in peripheral&#13;
areas of the city began to tap into the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As noted in Table IV.3, the water coverage rate in the city increased&#13;
fourfold over the period 1998 to 2004, increasing from 18% to&#13;
82%. Nevertheless, these official figures do not necessarily capture&#13;
the real situation on the ground. This is because clandestine&#13;
connections are a major problem in Parauapebas. These have&#13;
taken one of two forms. First, there is the issue of persistent&#13;
non-payment by customers, leading to eventual disconnection&#13;
by the utility company and often, the illegal reconnection to the&#13;
system. This problem has been exacerbated by the lack of a clear&#13;
legal framework on non-payment, as well as police reluctance&#13;
to enforce existing regulations. Second, there is the issue of the&#13;
unserved peripheries of the city. Those located close to the existing&#13;
network have made clandestine connections to ensure access&#13;
to the service. This problem can only be adequately resolved by        IV.7 Institutional Aspects&#13;

Law following extensive debate and unanimous endorsement&#13;
by the municipal council. This law incorporated principles for&#13;
determining and updating water and sewerage fees, as well&#13;
as service quality provisions that set a maximum of 5% for the&#13;
Supply Interruption Index. Because the municipality has a weak&#13;
institutional capacity, the regulatory framework has not always&#13;
been adequately enforced and upheld, particularly with regard to&#13;
tariff provisions and sanctions for non-payment of service.&#13;

IV.8 Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The case of Parauapebas is particularly noteworthy for a&#13;
number of reasons. First, it is one of very few cases in which the&#13;
condominial approach has been applied to water (as opposed&#13;
to sewerage) networks. Second, it illustrates the challenges&#13;
involved in constructing a city-wide system virtually from scratch&#13;
and achieving a fourfold increase in coverage in the space of&#13;
six years. Third, it is one of the most ambitious examples of&#13;
community mobilization with 100% of residents both financing&#13;
the materials for the condominial branches and contributing the&#13;
labor to excavate the trenches. Fourth, it provides some insight&#13;
into the potential operational advantages of condominial designs&#13;
for water systems, even if these have not been fully realized in&#13;
the case of Parauapebas.&#13;

V. Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This study described and compared the experience of the                   cost of connecting a household to the sewerage system in&#13;
implementation of the condominial model in three Brazilian cities:        Brasilia and Salvador was approximately US$300. The main&#13;
Brasilia (the nation's capital); Salvador (a major, historic metropolis   reasons behind this low unit cost are the reduced length of the&#13;
in northeastern Brazil); and Parauapebas (a small but fast-growing        public network (representing only 25% to 35% of the total length&#13;
boom town). Together, the projects analyzed have succeeded                of the system), reduced diameter (with a substantial proportion&#13;
in providing condominial networks to 2.5 million urban residents          of the sewer networks rendered in pipes measuring 100 to 150&#13;
in Brazil, with 214,000 connections organized in close to 16,000          millimeters in diameter), and reduced depth (with public networks&#13;
condominiums (Table V.1).                                                 laid at a maximum of one meter and condominial branches laid at&#13;
                                                                          approximately one-half meter).&#13;
The case studies differ in a number of ways. For instance,&#13;
Parauapebas is the only case in which the condominial system              The main lessons and conclusions from the case studies as a&#13;
was applied to the water network. In Brasilia and Parauapebas,            whole can be summarized as follows.&#13;
the model was adopted in a conscious, planned manner, whereas&#13;
in Salvador it was adopted gradually and opportunistically                First, the implementation of condominial systems for both water&#13;
in response to major engineering challenges. In Brasilia and              and sewerage has proved feasible on a large scale in major urban&#13;
Parauapebas, the implementation of the model was facilitated              areas of Brazil, and at relatively modest cost. Moreover, such&#13;
by relatively orderly urbanization, whereas in Salvador the systems       systems have demonstrated their versatility in the most challenging&#13;
had to be adapted to the demands of particularly dense, steep             peri-urban environments, where conventional systems are simply&#13;
and precarious urban slums. In Brasilia and Parauapebas, local            not an option.&#13;
residents covered the full cost of the condominial branches,&#13;
whereas in Salvador these were constructed free-of-charge.                Second, the large-scale social mobilization demanded by the&#13;
In Brasilia and Salvador, the system was almost entirely                  condominial approach has also proven feasible in the Brazilian&#13;
constructed by contractors, whereas in Parauapebas the                    context, and there have been no major difficulties for residents&#13;
condominial branches were installed almost entirely by community          to reach consensus about system design issues at the level of&#13;
members. In Brasilia, community maintenance of condominial                each condominium. The intensity of social mobilization efforts&#13;
branches has not posed serious problems, whereas in Salvador              needs to be considerably greater in cases where the community&#13;
it does not seem to have functioned very effectively. These               has chosen or is expected to contribute labor to the construction&#13;
contrasts illustrate the considerable variety of forms that the           of the system. However, even in other cases, it is important for&#13;
condominial model can take.                                               community mobilization efforts to include educational messages&#13;
                                                                          relating to proper system use and maintenance, the motivation for&#13;
Notwithstanding, comparing some of the key parameters from                and process of connecting to the network once available and the&#13;
the case studies reveals basic underlying similarities. The average       public health benefits associated with using the service.&#13;

Third, the available evidence does not suggest that the operation     genuinely assume maintenance responsibilities.&#13;

community to assume responsibility for maintenance has not            public in a clear, comprehensible way. This was the case in Brasilia&#13;

local conditions allow for pipes to be routed along sidewalks, the&#13;

            The experience of condominial water and
            sewerage systems in Brazil : case studies from Brasilia,
            Salvador and Parauebas

            The study presents the experience of
            applying the condominial approach to expand water and
            sewerage networks, in three contrasting Brazilian cities -
            Brasilia, Salvador, and Parauapebas. It is based on the
            findings of a study tour to Brazil (December 2003), and,
            projects mature and functioning condominial systems on the
            ground, as well as interacts with policy makers, utility
            managers, residents and specialists, to achieve a better
            understanding of the challenges and potential advantages,
            and disadvantages of implementing this systems. The
            so-called condominial approach to the construction of water,
            and sewerage networks was developed in Brazil during the
            1980's as response to the challenges posed by expanding
            services into peri-urban neighborhoods. While the
            condominial model has proved capable of meeting the
            considerable social, and engineering challenges posed in
            these areas, it is also a generic alternative to the design
            of water and sewerage systems. Indeed, the Brazilian
            experience illustrates how the model has been successfully
            applied to urban neighborhoods, as diverse as the Rocinha
            slum in Rio de Janeiro, and the affluent Lago Sul and Lago
            Norte districts of Brasilia.
