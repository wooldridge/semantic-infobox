The Economic Policy and Poverty Reduction Division of WBI (WBIEP) conducted a core&#13;
course on Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction: Theory, Evidence, and Implications for&#13;
South Asia in Colombo, Sri Lanka, from October 19-23, 1998. The purpose of the course was&#13;
to introduce participants to both theoretical approaches and the most recent developments in&#13;
the area of the linkage between economic growth and poverty alleviation. The course targeted&#13;
senior and mid-level government officials of South Asian countries, particularly those from&#13;
Ministries of Finance and Planning, Central Banks, and academics and researchers from the&#13;
South Asia region, as well as Bank staff in the South Asia Resident Missions. The course&#13;
focused on policy and research issues pertinent to South Asia, so that participants could&#13;
develop policy recommendations for their own countries. The 5-day course was delivered&#13;
through a series of lectures, including country case presentations, concluding with a panel&#13;
discussion on the last day. A total of 40 participants from 5 countries attended this course,&#13;
including 7 (17.5%) women.&#13;
&#13;
The WBI Evaluation Unit (WBIES) conducted a Level 1 (participants' reaction) evaluation&#13;
using a participants' feedback questionnaire. In the questionnaire, respondents were asked&#13;
to give their views about course design and delivery, as well as their perceived level of&#13;
knowledge on 10 specific course topics, before and after the course. A 5-point Likert type&#13;
scale that ranged from 1=minimum to 5=maximum was used for each question.&#13;
Respondents were also asked to write comments or suggestions for the course in an open-&#13;
ended format. The questionnaire was completed by a total of 36 respondents, 90% of the&#13;
total participants, including all 7 women (19.4%). Following are some of the evaluation&#13;
findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Course Design and Delivery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Although not required as pre-requisite, the course organizer had considered an&#13;
        advanced graduate-level degree in economics or related field as a "desirable" level of&#13;
        educational background for the course participants. Among the 36 respondents, 21&#13;
        (58.3%) had advanced academic degrees in economics or related fields, including&#13;
        masters degrees or equivalent (N=15, or 41.7%), post-graduate diploma (N=1, or&#13;
        2.8%), or doctorates degrees (N=5, or 13.9%). The remaining 15 respondents had&#13;
        either a bachelors' degree in economics (N=2, or 5.6%), some economic courses at&#13;
        the university level but not as a major (N=12, or 33.3%), or virtually no formal studies&#13;
        in economics (N=1, or 2.8%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The relevance of the course to respondents' current work or function received a mean&#13;
        score of 3.86 out of 5.0. Respondents indicated high expectations for learning from&#13;
        attending the course, particularly for their personal learning needs (mean=4.36). They&#13;
        felt that what they learned from the course would be highly relevant to their future&#13;
        work (mean=4.28).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   l  The overall usefulness of the course was 3.78 out of 5.0. The result was slightly&#13;
      higher among respondents with the advanced economics degrees (N=21, mean=3.90)&#13;
      than for those without the degrees (N=15, mean=3.60). There was only a minimal&#13;
      difference in ratings between the 2 groups of varying educational background on&#13;
      indicators measuring the quality of information provided in the course. The extent to&#13;
      which the information was perceived useful had a mean score of 3.76 for the group&#13;
      with the advanced degrees, and 3.67 for the non-degree group. The extent to which&#13;
      the information was new to respondents was 3.43, and 3.53, respectively, for the 2&#13;
      groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  The course used 3 different instructional means to deliver key messages, lecture&#13;
      presentations, group discussions and reading materials. Results showed that lecture&#13;
      presentations and group discussions had a similar level of respondents' satisfaction at&#13;
      the 3.7 level. The usefulness of reading materials provided during the course had the&#13;
      highest score among the 3 items, a rating exceeding 4.0 out of 5.0 (mean=4.06).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  Instructors' overall effectiveness in communicating their messages (mean=3.97) and&#13;
      the quality of their responses to participants' questions (mean=3.83) were among the&#13;
      highest of all course performance indicators. It should be noted that, while a majority&#13;
      of respondents (N=27) indicated that trainers and participants had an "adequate" level&#13;
      of interaction, a number of respondents also felt that the number of participants in the&#13;
      class was "excessive" or "somewhat excessive" (N=12), and the types of participants&#13;
      were too diverse to have close interaction (N=7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Self-Reported Knowledge&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  Respondents' pre/post self-assessment of their knowledge levels indicated a positive&#13;
      gain of 20% or larger across all 10 course topics. Issues on "Management of&#13;
      commodity booms and economic growth" was an area that respondents' perceived&#13;
      understanding improved substantially after the course. The rating increased from 2.85&#13;
      to 4.10 (gain=43.9%) for the group with the advanced economics degrees, and from&#13;
      2.27 to 3.33 (gain=46.7%) for the group without the degrees. This item was the least&#13;
      familiar topic before the course for both groups, but had one of the largest percentage&#13;
      gains after the course for both groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  Respondents without advanced economics degrees (N=15) came to the course with&#13;
      much lower levels of knowledge than those with the degrees (N=21), and their post-&#13;
      course ratings remained lower than the group with the degrees on all 10 topics. The&#13;
      group with the higher educational degrees had a pre-course knowledge level&#13;
      exceeding 3.0 out of 5.0 on all topics, ranging between 3.20-3.62, except on 2 items&#13;
      that had ratings in the high 2.0 range (2.85 for "Management of commodity booms"&#13;
      and 2.71 for "Polarization, inequality and political violence"). Their post-course levels&#13;
      were above 4.0 on 7 topics, ranging 4.0-4.24, except for 3 topics (3.36 for&#13;
      "Polarization, inequality and political violence," 3.81 for "Distribution of education,"&#13;
      and 3.83 for "Impact of growth-promoting policies"). For the group which did not have&#13;
      advanced economics degrees, the pre-course ratings on the 10 topics were in the&#13;
      2.27-2.67 level. While they had a substantial percentage gain across all items,&#13;
      ranging from 27.3% (on "Impact of growth-promoting policies") to 52.9% ("Evolution of&#13;
      worldwide income distribution"), all of their post-course ratings were below 4.0, ranging&#13;
      from 3.22 to 3.73.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Comments from Respondents&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  lWritten comments and suggestions from respondents can be summarized into 3&#13;
   general areas of course content and delivery. First, 20 respondents commented on&#13;
   the country studies and the types of topics covered in the lecture presentations. They&#13;
   requested more country case examples and presentations relevant to the participants&#13;
   (N=8), more in-depth treatment of poverty alleviation and its specific methods (N=6),&#13;
   more emphasis on analytical techniques (N=3) and on policy implementation and&#13;
   future agenda (N=3). Second, a number of respondents preferred active participation in&#13;
   the course work (N=14), requesting more group discussions or exercises (N=8),&#13;
   chances for presenting their own country experiences (N=4) and hands-on&#13;
   experiences in deriving strategies for some country cases (N=2). Third, there were&#13;
   several comments about the instructors (N=7), including that instructors should&#13;
   present more empirical evidences, discuss their field experiences, and describe both&#13;
   theoretical background and current developments when presenting their issues.&#13;
