Description of Activities, Expenditures and Governance Arrangements under the Public&#13;
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Program, Phase IV&#13;
Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all agreements entered&#13;
into between the Bank and entities (collectively, the "Donors") that provide contributions (the&#13;
aggregate of all contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to be administered by the&#13;
Bank for the Trust Fund.&#13;
A. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
1.    Purpose and Objective&#13;
The strengthening of public expenditure, procurement and financial accountability systems is&#13;
a key element in the efforts towards the promotion of economic development, poverty&#13;
reduction and good governance. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability&#13;
Program ("PEFA Program") was established in December, 2001 to support the development&#13;
of integrated and coordinated approaches to assessment and reform in the field of public&#13;
expenditure, procurement and financial accountability, with the particular goals to:&#13;
(a)   develop an approach to improve public financial management ("PFM") system&#13;
reform outcomes and learn lessons of successful and unsuccessful PFM&#13;
reforms; and&#13;
(b)   reduce transaction costs to countries from  duplicative and overlapping&#13;
diagnostics while ensuring that the information needs of donors can still be&#13;
met.&#13;
Following the development of the PFM Performance Measurement Framework (the "PFM&#13;
Framework") and the Strengthened Approach to supporting PFM reform (the "Strengthened&#13;
Approach") during the first four years (under the PEFA Program, Phase I), the PEFA Program&#13;
has, during Phases II and III aimed to monitor and provide technical support on the&#13;
application of the PFM Framework, to provide a common information pool on PFM systems&#13;
based on completed PEFA Program assessments, to fine-tune the PFM Framework and to&#13;
support dissemination, training and lesson learning on the PFM Framework and the&#13;
Strengthened Approach, in order to meet its goals. Phase IV of the PEFA Program will&#13;
continue to support these activities while expanding its focus on the use of assessments for&#13;
multiple purposes.&#13;
The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Program, Phase IV Multi-Donor Trust&#13;
Fund supports the strengthening of partnerships between development agencies that&#13;
contribute to the achievements of the goals of the PEFA Program mentioned above. The&#13;
Trust Fund's global, intermediate and direct objectives are as follows:&#13;
(a)   to improve PFM system performance for strengthened economic growth and&#13;
government service delivery (global objective);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿(b)   to have PEFA assessments used for PFM reform formulation, donor support&#13;
decisions and research (intermediate objective); and&#13;
(c)   to expand and update the global, common and credible information pool on&#13;
PFM systems performance (direct objective).&#13;
2.    Eligible Activities&#13;
The Trust Fund will finance the activities set forth in Section V.4 of the Program Document&#13;
for the PEFA Program, Phase IV (2012-2017) approved by the Steering Committee of the&#13;
PEFA Program on April 25, 2012 (the "Program Document"), as amended from time to time&#13;
by decision of the Steering Committee in accordance with the Governance Arrangements (as&#13;
defined below) (the "Eligible Activities").&#13;
B. CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURE&#13;

(q)   associated overheads;&#13;
(r)   extended termconsultants&#13;
(s)   temporary support staff costs; and&#13;

associated overheads includes the translation of policy documents and substantive reports&#13;
approved by the Steering Committee.&#13;
The foregoing categories of expenditures may include the financing of taxes.&#13;

The "Program Governance Arrangements" set forth in Section VI of the Program Document,&#13;
as amended from time to time by decision of the Steering Committee, shall apply to the Trust&#13;
Fund (the "Governance Arrangements").&#13;
Any amendments to the Eligible Activities or the Governance Arrangements shall become&#13;
applicable to this Administration Agreement as such amendments take effect without further&#13;
need to amend this Administration Agreement; provided that such amendments do not&#13;
conflict with applicable Bank policies and procedures and provided further that in the event of&#13;
