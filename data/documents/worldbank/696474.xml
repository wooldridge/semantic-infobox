MEXICO&#13;
WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
1.   PROJECT AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   Most of Mexico is either arid or semiarid and because of this, socioeconomic&#13;
growth and the well-being of its people have been closely tied to water resources&#13;
availability and development. Mexico's history of water resources management and&#13;
development dates from long before the Spanish conquest. Because of its recent rapid&#13;
population and economic growth and because of increasing difficulties in developing new&#13;
water resources, Mexico faces major critical challenges in water resources management&#13;
now and in the future.&#13;
1.2   As a part of its ongoing ambitious economic modernization program, the&#13;
Government of Mexico (GOM) is confronted with problems arising from growing water&#13;
scarcity and the more general need to conserve and protect the nation's natural and&#13;
environmental resources. The National Congress approved a new National Water Law&#13;
(Ley de Aguas Nacionales, LAN) in December 1992 and its regulations in January 1994.&#13;
The LAN sets out broad based mandates for the development and implementation of plans&#13;
and policies related to water resources management. The responsibility for responding to&#13;
these mandates was assigned to Mexico's National Water Commission (Comisi6n&#13;
Nacional del Agua, CNA).&#13;
1.3   CNA (the national water authority) is a relatively young institution created in&#13;
1989. It inherited a water system and institutional mechanisms that were in desperate&#13;
need of modernization. The water infrastructure was in poor repair. Individuals served by&#13;
the water systems had lost confidence in "top-down" centralized government policies&#13;
emanating from Mexico City. During its short tenure, CNA has made remarkable strides&#13;
in ameliorating many of these basic problems. Through its promotion of the creation of&#13;
Water User Organizations, CNA has decentralized operation and maintenance activities in&#13;
irrigation districts. At the local and regional levels, it has successfully joined stakeholders&#13;
(state and local governments, water users and other interested parties) in programs&#13;
designed to: (a) improve water resources planning and management; (b) modernize water&#13;
infrastructure; (c) improve and make more responsive operation and maintenance&#13;
activities; and (d) reduce technical and financial dependence on central authorities.&#13;
1.4   Notwithstanding these successes, CNA faces formidable challenges if it is to&#13;
effectively respond to the mandates of the LAN. CNA's established expertise in the&#13;
construction and operation of water storage and distribution facilities is not well suited for&#13;
meeting the challenges of water resources planning and management. CNA has a&#13;
relatively small group of highly qualified professionals with experience and training related&#13;
to water resources planning and management which needs to be built upon, expanded and&#13;
enhanced in order to meet the challenges of the LAN. CNA lacks the equipment and&#13;
&#13;

technologies for contemporary monitoring programs requisite to activities such as the&#13;
rational control of water quantity and quality, comprehensive regional water resources&#13;
planning, improved reservoir operation and aquifer management, and dam safety.&#13;
B. LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
1.5   Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution (adopted in 1917) recognizes the Nation as&#13;
the owner of all water within the territory and authorizes the government to administer&#13;
these resources and to grant "concessions" for water use. The LAN and its regulations&#13;
have established a legal and regulatory framework to tackle the management of scarce&#13;
water resources. The stated objective of the law is "to regulate the extraction, use,&#13;
distribution and control of the nation's waters as well as preserve their quantity and quality&#13;
in order to achieve sustainable integral development". Implementation of the LAN and its&#13;
relevant regulatory matters is a main CNA task. Refer to Annex A for more details.&#13;
1.6   The LAN recognizes the importance of water resources management and&#13;
authorizes CNA to carry out this function with the objective of achieving sustainable&#13;
development and use of water resources. Water management is to be carried out with the&#13;
participation of water users to the maximum extent possible. The LAN specifically&#13;
authorizes the establishment of river basin councils (Consejos de Cuenca) that would be&#13;
responsible for coordinating activities and reaching consensus between CNA; other&#13;
federal, state and municipal agencies; and water user representatives on matters related to&#13;
water management in the river basins.&#13;
1.7   When determined to be necessary by CNA, the LAN provides for the&#13;
establishment by decree of special administrative and reserve zones in areas where&#13;
problems of overuse, water quality or the environment necessitate this action. Zones can&#13;
also be established during drought conditions or during other emergency situations. In&#13;
these zones, water use can be restricted or curtailed completely as determined to be&#13;
technically necessary to preserve the environment and the water resources.&#13;
C. INSTITUTIONAL SETTING&#13;
1.8   Mexican water resources policy as presented in the National Water Plan 1995-&#13;
2000 (Programa Nacional Hidraulico 1995 - 2000) is oriented toward ensuring the&#13;
availability of water to satisfy the needs of the population and promote the development of&#13;
economic activities in a manner that is environmentally compatible and sustainable in each&#13;
region of the country. In accordance with this policy, avenues must be found for&#13;
sustainable development which requires establishing control and conditionalities on water&#13;
usage such that economic development is compatible with environmental protection. The&#13;
importance that the GOM bestows on the environment and on sustainable use of water&#13;
resources is manifest in the decision to relocate CNA from the old Agriculture and Water&#13;
Resources Ministry to the newly created Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries&#13;
Ministry, (Secretaria de Medio Ambiente, Recursos Naturales y Pesca - SEMARNAP).&#13;
This change has strengthened the authority that CNA has in the administration and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report         3&#13;
management of water resources, because it is no longer located within a Ministry&#13;
responsible for one sector (agriculture). In accordance with the National Water Plan&#13;
1995-2000 and the LAN, CNA has set a new agenda to modernize and decentralize the&#13;
management of the nation's water resources considering all uses and the preservation of&#13;
the environment. The Water Resources Management Project (WRMP) is the instrument&#13;
that the GOM has designed to carry out this new agenda. Refer to Annex A for more&#13;
details.&#13;
1.9   CNA was created in 1989 to unite all aspects of water management. CNA has a&#13;
central office located in Mexico City and 6 regional offices, as follows: Northwest, in&#13;
Ciudad Obreg6n, Sonora; North, in Torre6n, Coahuila; Northeast, in San Luis Potosi, San&#13;
Luis Potosi; Southeast, in Merida, Yucatan; Lerma-Balsas, in Queretaro, Queretaro; and&#13;
Valley of Mexico, in Ciudad de M6xico, Distrito Federal. In addition, CNA has state&#13;
offices located in each of the 31 state capitals. CNA has functioned in a centralized way,&#13;
but has recently adopted and is currently implementing a policy whereby: (a) the Central&#13;
Office functions will include oversight of water management activities and establishment&#13;
of overall policy, criteria and uniform guidelines and procedures; and (b) the Regional&#13;
Offices will have principle responsibility for water management, including: (i) the&#13;
development of hydrographic regional plans; (ii) the promotion and strengthening of basin&#13;
councils; (iii) the coordination of water resources planning and management activities both&#13;
by public and private sector participants; (iv) water quantity and quality monitoring&#13;
activities; (v) reservoir operation; (vi) the registry of water users into the National Public&#13;
Water Rights Register; and (vii) dam safety.&#13;
1.10  At each level (central, regional and state) CNA has a similar organizational&#13;
structure. There are three subdirectorates within CNA which would have direct&#13;
responsibilities for the implementation of the Project. They are: (a) the Technical&#13;
Subdirectorate (Subdirecci6n General Tecnica, SGT), responsible for aspects related to&#13;
meteorology, surface water, groundwater, water quality and dam safety; (b) the Planning&#13;
Subdirectorate (Subdirecci6n General de Programaci6n, SGP), responsible for water&#13;
resources planning and river basin councils; and (c) the Water Administration&#13;
Subdirectorate (Subdirecci6n General de Administraci6n del Agua, SGAA), responsible&#13;
for water rights administration. Because these three departments encompass&#13;
responsibilities for all aspects of water resources management and their being located&#13;
within one institution with clearly defined legal responsibilities, CNA's organizational&#13;
structure is very well suited to planning, coordinating and implementing a comprehensive&#13;
integrated water resource management program.&#13;
1.11  Presently the CNA Regional Office boundaries are along State lines. As stated in&#13;
the National Water Plan 1995-2000, GOM has recently decided to reorganize CNA's&#13;
regional dependencies into 13 regional offices with their boundaries being located along&#13;
river basin boundaries. This reorganization will significantly facilitate the regional offices'&#13;
abilities to carry out their water management responsibilities, because river basins will be&#13;
located totally within the geographical limits of the Regional Offices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                 MEXCO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
1.12 In accordance with the LAN, CNA is the national water authority with complete&#13;
responsibility for water rights administration, the management of the nations water&#13;
resources and dam safety. Other public and private entities, including the Federal&#13;
Electricity Commission (Comisi6n Federal de Electricidad - CFE), that operate reservoirs&#13;
must do so with CNA authorization and oversight. CFE operates 64 dams with&#13;
hydroelectric plants. The Director General of CNA presides over a Technical Committee&#13;
for the Operation of Hydraulic Works. In addition to CNA authorities and technical&#13;
personnel, a CFE representative participates on the committee. The committee makes&#13;
overall decisions relative to the operation of the nation's reservoirs including&#13;
considerations related to floods, droughts, multiple uses (irrigation, municipal and&#13;
industrial, hydropower, navigation, recreation, etc.) and environmental protection.&#13;
1.13 The Mexican Institute for Water Technology (Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia&#13;
del Agua - IMTA) is responsible for water related research, technology evaluation and&#13;
transfer, and for training. It coordinates work being done at universities, research centers&#13;
and other institutions in Mexico and internationally, and has cooperative relationships with&#13;
various water related entities throughout the world. LMTA's participation in the training&#13;
subcomponent as well as in other aspects of the project will be important to its success.&#13;
D. CHALLENGES FOR WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN MEXICO&#13;
1.14  Mexico has a mean annual rainfall of 780 mm, about 27% of which becomes runoff&#13;
of about 410 billion m3 per year. Renewable groundwater is estimated at 63 billion m3 per&#13;
year, 48 billion from natural recharge and another 15 billion from deep percolation&#13;
associated with irrigation projects. Additionally, there are an estimated 110 billion m3 of&#13;
non-renewable groundwater that could be available for one-time use. Climatic regions&#13;
vary greatly from tropical rainforests with over 3000 mm of annual rainfall in the south to&#13;
arid deserts with less than 100 mm in the north. Runoff variation is even more extreme,&#13;
from over 2 million rn3 per square kilometer per year in the wettest areas to essentially&#13;
zero in the driest.&#13;
1.15  In the dryer parts of the country, precipitation and runoff are highly erratic with&#13;
large variations from year to year and extreme seasonal differences. In these areas, rainfall&#13;
occurs during a 2- to 4-month period and is related to thunderstorm and hurricane&#13;
activities which can be very intense and cause flash flooding. Runoff is directly associated&#13;
with the precipitation and most streams and even rivers dry up during periods of no&#13;
rainfall.&#13;
1.16 Mexico is a country of approximately two million square kilometers with about 90&#13;
million inhabitants as of the end of 1995. This compares to a population of about 25&#13;
million in 1950, an increase of 3.6 times in 45 years. Population growth has occurred in&#13;
every part of the country, but has been greatest in the northwest, northeast and central&#13;
regions, precisely the areas with the most severe water scarcity problems. During this&#13;
same period, the economy as measured by gross domestic product has increased from&#13;
about US$40 billion to about US$330 billion (in constant 1994 dollars) or an eightfold&#13;
increase. Both population and the economy (notwithstanding the severe economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MENiCO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report 5&#13;
dislocation of 1995) are projected to continue to grow at annual rates of 1.5% and 3.C%/o,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
1.17  The location of population and economic activity is inversely related to the&#13;
availability of water. Less than a third of total runoff occurs within the 75% of the&#13;
territory where most of the country's largest cities, industrial facilities and irrigated land&#13;
are located. Consequently, surface runoff and groundwater are increasingly insufficient to&#13;
support the high growth rates and economic activity, resulting in disputes over surface&#13;
water usage and the overpumping of aquifers; additionally, water pollution has reduced&#13;
the potential beneficial use of certain rivers and water bodies. Conflicts among competing&#13;
and intersectoral users have heightened important political and social side effects.&#13;
Paradoxically, the abundance of water in some areas also presents severe problems of land&#13;
drainage and flooding.&#13;
1.18  The GOM has concluded that a major effort should be made to improve water&#13;
management, conservation and intersectoral allocation of water resources. The latter will&#13;
rely principally on the establishment of a system of tradable water rights (water markets).&#13;
The historical increases in population and economic output have resulted in increasing&#13;
demand on the nation's natural resources, which in the case of water has reached the limit&#13;
of its availability in many regions of the country. Continued growth will depend on&#13;
making water available to those sectors that require it in sufficient quantity and adequate&#13;
quality. Constructing new reservoirs is costly and often environmentally questionable.&#13;
Other alternatives for increasing water supply such as transbasin diversions and&#13;
desalinization in most cases would be prohibitively expensive. Improved water&#13;
management, conservation and the establishment of a system of tradable water rights&#13;
(water markets), if well planned and administered, can make significant amounts of&#13;
adequate quality water available when and where it is needed without major new&#13;
construction.&#13;
1.19  Population growth and urbanization have increased the demand for water.&#13;
Conflicts have arisen between urban and rural users, between neighboring cities, and, most&#13;
frequently, between neighboring states and regions. Increasing gaps between those who&#13;
have access to water services and those who do not; overpumping and contamination of&#13;
aquifers; overdiversion and deterioration of water quality in rivers and lakes; severe&#13;
natural occurrences of flooding and droughts; downgrading of water services due to poor&#13;
maintenance and weak technical and administrative support; and water wastage or&#13;
inefficient water use practices are among the pressing problems facing water management&#13;
in Mexico. The situation can only become more difficult as population and economic&#13;
growth continue in the future. The GOM urgently needs to address these problems in a&#13;
comprehensive, and well planned and executed water resources management program&#13;
which is the purpose of the WRMP.&#13;
1.20  Surface Water. Water has played a crucial role in Mexico's national and regional&#13;
development. For over 60 years, the expanding use of surface water for irrigation,&#13;
municipal and industrial purposes has been based on the development of hydraulic&#13;
infrastructure. In the future, the construction of dams and other hydraulic infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                 MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
will be increasingly difficult, because most of the obvious economically justifiable water&#13;
resources developments have been completed. Environmental concerns and land use and&#13;
resettlement issues have also reduced the likelihood of new major developments.&#13;
Nevertheless, underutilization and economic inefficiencies in the use of existing facilities&#13;
provides far-reaching opportunities for water conservation and equitable reallocation&#13;
through a comprehensive water management program.&#13;
1.21  Hydrology. The country's hydrometric network requires major upgrading, both in&#13;
quantity and technology. Surface water management should be based on good&#13;
hydrological assessments and comprehensive technically supported regional water&#13;
resources planning studies, which in turn require sufficient accurate data. The&#13;
determination of potential impacts on third parties is required for the adequate&#13;
administration of water rights and water right transfers. This requires adequate accurate&#13;
data and good river basin hydrological modeling. Hydrological information for reservoir&#13;
inflows and outflows and data to improve reservoir management during floods, droughts&#13;
and normal conditions are needed.&#13;
1.22  Groundwater. Two million hectares of irrigated agriculture, 55 million city&#13;
dwellers and more than half of the industrial production in the country are dependent on&#13;
groundwater for their water needs. In most cases alternative sources of water are either&#13;
not available or too costly.&#13;
1.23  Overexploitation (withdrawal in excess of recharge) of groundwater resources is a&#13;
major problem in the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico where the majority of the&#13;
people and industrial production are located, and where irrigation is a major consumer of&#13;
water. This leads to increased pumping costs, to abandonment or reconstruction of wells&#13;
as water table levels go down, and to degradation of groundwater quality. Because&#13;
overexploitation is inherently a non-sustainable condition and because important regions&#13;
of the country are dependent upon groundwater resources for their water supply, well&#13;
planned and strong management actions are necessary to avoid economic and social&#13;
disruption.&#13;
1.24  CNA has identified and characterized 459 aquifers and performed hydrogeological&#13;
assessments on many of them. They have determined that 80 of these aquifers are&#13;
presently overexploited, some having critical problems. Improved groundwater&#13;
monitoring, aquifer modeling and evaluation are urgently needed to better identify&#13;
problems and plan cost effective solutions. Major efforts will be required to evaluate&#13;
aquifers, and develop and implement programs for aquifer stabilization. This requires&#13;
adequate accurate data and good aquifer modeling.&#13;
1.25  Meteorology. Because of its geographic location, Mexico is subject to a variety&#13;
of meteorological phenomena including thunderstorms, and tropical and subtropical&#13;
hurricanes which occasion intense rainfall resulting in often severe flooding. These&#13;
occurrences can cause major economic social and environmental damage and loss of life,&#13;
and therefore require state-of-the-art meteorological and hydrological forecasting services,&#13;
excellent coordinated flood warning systems and considerable floodplain planning of both&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report         7&#13;
structural and non-structural management measures. In much of the country, these intense&#13;
rainfall events are the main source of water to fill the storage reservoirs and good water&#13;
management requires balancing the often conflicting objectives of capturing and storing as&#13;
much water as possible for future release during dry periods while maintaining a certain&#13;
storage capacity empty in order to provide for flood protection.&#13;
1.26  Droughts. Mexico is also subject to the phenomena of droughts, particularly in&#13;
the northern part of the country. Droughts may last from 1 to 4 years and during these&#13;
periods rainfall and runoff may be reduced by as much as 40%. Because in many areas,&#13;
water utilization nearly equals and even exceeds availability during normal years, droughts&#13;
require major managed reductions in use and good contingency planning.&#13;
1.27 Although some drought contingency planning and management is done in Mexico,&#13;
it is mostly localized and directed towards dealing with emergencies while they occur.&#13;
What is needed is the definition of criteria and procedures, the development of detailed&#13;
drought contingency plans, and the adoption of institutional and coordination mechanisms&#13;
for implementing the plans prior to, during and after droughts.&#13;
1.28  Water Quality. As surface and groundwater exploitation has increased through&#13;
the years, there has been an accompanying degradation in water quality. This occurs with&#13;
all consumptive uses of water and is the consequence of the sequence of diversion, use&#13;
and return flow, the later invariably having a poorer quality than the former. Untreated&#13;
return flows from industries, municipalities and irrigation are often highly contaminating.&#13;
In the case of groundwater, there is also the problem of salt water intrusion from saline&#13;
water bodies or saline aquifers. Water quality deterioration has been especially&#13;
pronounced in Central and Northcentral regions of the country and major management&#13;
actions are required in order to achieve sustainable continued development.&#13;
1.29  In recent years, CNA has been attempting to address the water quality problem.&#13;
The process of classifying water bodies, inventorying point discharges, issuing discharge&#13;
requirements and inspections of compliance with discharge requirements is a huge&#13;
undertaking which will take many years. Considerable capacity building and numerous&#13;
water quality assessments will be necessary. CNA has identified 20 critical basins where&#13;
they are presently directing their efforts.&#13;
1.30 To support the CNA!s necessary role, water quality laboratories will have to be&#13;
upgraded, equipped and certified at the central and regional levels of CNA in order to&#13;
perform a large number of analyses. The water quality monitoring network and water&#13;
quality information system will need to be upgraded.&#13;
1.31  Dam Safety. Mexico has over 4000 dams (more than 3 meters high and/or with&#13;
storage capacity greater than .5 million cubic meters). Of these, 640 can be classified as&#13;
"Large Dams" (more than 15 meters high) in accordance with the International&#13;
Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD). Many of these dams have population centers&#13;
downstream as well as valuable property. Additionally, many of the dams were built&#13;
several decades ago using design and construction standards that would be considered&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                 MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
inadequate today. In many cases lack of adequate maintenance has created potentially&#13;
unsafe conditions.&#13;
1.32  CNA has recently initiated a dam safety program to address these issues which&#13;
needs to be strengthened. The current program which is in its initial phase includes:&#13;
(a) completion of a National Register of Dams; (b) inspection and hazard classification of all&#13;
dams included in the National Register; and (c) establishing and consolidating institutional&#13;
mechanisms and technical procedures for an ongoing safety of dams program. In a&#13;
separate program CNA will carry out necessary repairs as soon as practicable after their need is&#13;
detected. Part of this program could be financed by the Bank under a separate future loan.&#13;
1.33 Water Rights Administration. The establishment of the National Public Water&#13;
Rights Register (Registro Publico de Derechos de Agua - REPDA) and the development&#13;
and implementation of institutionaUadministrative mechanisms and procedures for granting&#13;
water right concessions, approving transfers, authorizing discharges, charging and&#13;
collecting fees, and establishing and administering special reserve zones are prerequisites&#13;
to a rational, efficient and equitable reallocation of water between various users and uses&#13;
which can partially be accomplished through a well established and administered system of&#13;
tradable water rights. The mechanisms and procedures need to be straightforward,&#13;
equitable, rapid and not costly.&#13;
1.34  CNA is presently in the process of identifying users, assisting them in becoming&#13;
registered water users or dischargers, and providing the necessary administrative and&#13;
technical support to the water fee charge/collection process. This is a massive&#13;
undertaking. As of the end of March 1996, about 43,400 water users have initiated the&#13;
registration process and about 37,600 have been formally registered. The total number of&#13;
users to be registered is not known, but is estimated to be on the order of 300,000. This&#13;
estimate considers irrigation units and modules each as single users, when in fact they can&#13;
have a number of individual irrigators within their areas.&#13;
1.35  The charging and collecting of fees is of major importance for water management&#13;
in Mexico for three main reasons: (a) when effectively set, applied and administered they&#13;
can provide major incentives for conservation and economically efficient use of water, and&#13;
for reducing contamination; (b) they can provide effective inducements for the beneficial&#13;
use of water and for trading water rights to higher value users; and (c) even though there&#13;
is no direct relation between fee collection and financing of water management activities,&#13;
they could provide the possibility in the future of directly financing water management&#13;
activities depending on the policy of GOM. Additionally, if fee collections could be&#13;
applied to addressing water management needs directly in the regions (basins, aquifers)&#13;
where they are collected, this could increase the willingness to pay of the water users,&#13;
because they would be able to directly observe the benefits in their areas and could benefit&#13;
directly from the improved management.&#13;
1.36 Although the government has made good progress in identifying and registering&#13;
current water users and discharges since the 1992 publication of the LAN and its 1994&#13;
regulations, there are still many issues related to the administration of water rights that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report         9&#13;
need to be tackled to ensure that the water market achieves its desired objectives. Some&#13;
of these include facilitating the registration of existing water users, implementing a&#13;
modified fee schedule for extracting and discharging water, training CNA staff so that&#13;
they can better protect against aquifer depletion and possible negative third-party effects,&#13;
and volumetric pricing.&#13;
1.37  Water Resources Planning. All of the activities discussed in paragraphs 1.20&#13;
through 1.36 above need to be carried out within the framework of a comprehensive&#13;
planning process that integrates the various actions into a coordinated whole. The GOM&#13;
developed National Water Plans in 1975, 1981 and 1994. The National Water Plan 1995-&#13;
2000 (a recently updated version of the 1994 Plan) provides a good understanding of&#13;
water availability in different regions of the country and of the historical, present and&#13;
projected future demands for water. The Plan identifies water as a strategic national&#13;
resource that needs to be managed and preserved in support of growing and changing&#13;
needs, and lays out strategies and lines of action for meeting the future water demands of&#13;
the country. The Plan emphasizes: (a) improving the operation, maintenance and use of&#13;
existing monitoring networks and hydraulic infrastructure; (b) transferring irrigation&#13;
districts to water users; (c) promoting the participation of water users and other interested&#13;
parties in water planning and management issues; (d) promoting the participation of the&#13;
private sector; (e) increasing and improving municipal and domestic water supplies;&#13;
(f) reducing contamination of surface and groundwater bodies; (g) developing and&#13;
implementing programs for aquifer stabilization; (h) promoting the establishment and&#13;
strengthening of river basin councils; (i) decentralizing water planning and management&#13;
activities; and () providing training to individuals and strengthening to institutions&#13;
involved in water management. In 1995 the GOM presented a National Development Plan&#13;
1995-2000 for which the National Water Plan is a support document. The National Water&#13;
Plan will play a key role in the success of the National Development Plan particularly in&#13;
the development of 100 urban centers.&#13;
1.38  The LAN identifies the river basin as the appropriate unit for water resources&#13;
planning and management. At the river basin level, comprehensive plans need to be&#13;
developed in the context of a broad strategy which considers the responsibilities and&#13;
activities of all participants in water use and management, while fully taking into account&#13;
the ecosystems and socioeconomnic structures that exist in the river basin. The planning&#13;
process should deal with cross-sectoral issues with the goal of ensuring the sustainability&#13;
of the water environment for multiple uses as an integral part of the country's economic&#13;
development process.&#13;
1.39 River Basin Councils. The river basin councils, provided for in the LAN, have a&#13;
key role to play in river basin planning and management. They will provide a forum for:&#13;
(a) identifying and evaluating problems and needs; (b) developing consensus between the&#13;
various government entities, water users and other interested parties; (c) recommending&#13;
actions; (d) obtaining comrmitments to carry out the actions; and (e) following up to&#13;
ensure continued commitment and compliance with agreed upon initiatives. The river&#13;
basin councils have the overall responsibility of making the planning process dynamic,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
participatory and result oriented, rather than a sterile paper exercise, as is often the case&#13;
when undertaken by centralized government institutions.&#13;
1.40 There is presently one functioning river basin council: Lerma-Chapala which has&#13;
been operational since 1993. In addition, there are two river basin councils that have&#13;
recently been formed but have yet to show significant advances in water resources&#13;
planning and management: (a) Rio Bravo; and (b) Valley of Mexico. During the next&#13;
few years ten additional river basin councils will be organized. All of these councils will&#13;
need major support to ensure they achieve their objectives.&#13;
1.41  The GOM and CNA have developed a long-term vision (probably at least a 10-to-&#13;
20-year time-frame) for water management in Mexico whereby the river basin councils&#13;
would provide the nucleus for regional organizations that would assume operational and&#13;
financial responsibilities for water resources management within the hydrographic regions.&#13;
They would become technically, administratively, financially and operationally&#13;
independent. CNA would revert to being the national water authority, including water&#13;
rights administration and ensuring that water management is carried out in accordance&#13;
with the law and regulations.&#13;
1.42  Special Administrative and Reserve Zones. One of the goals of the planning&#13;
process, as provided for in the LAN, will be the identification and classification of special&#13;
administrative and reserve zones, and the development of contingency plans for them.&#13;
The zones may be established in areas where surface water, groundwater or both are&#13;
overexploited, or where water quality or environmental problems are severe. These zones&#13;
will be critically important in achieving the sustainable development goals of the GOM.&#13;
Each zone will have special individual aspects which will require specific actions, but&#13;
should be established within an overall policy framework. Criteria, mechanisms and&#13;
enforcement procedures for the zones will need to be designed and implemented and&#13;
should be equitable, efficient and cost effective.&#13;
1.43  Capacity Building. Water resources management activities need to be improved&#13;
and intensified at the central and regional levels. Both levels will require considerable&#13;
capacity building and restructuring in order for them to be able to assume their myriad&#13;
water resources management responsibilities in an integrated, efficient and competent&#13;
manner.&#13;
1.44  The capacity building will be geared towards meeting the needs of the different&#13;
levels. The Central office needs to direct its capacity building towards the development of&#13;
policy, guidelines and manuals and towards coordination of water management activities&#13;
at the national level. Regional office capacity building should be geared towards regional&#13;
planning and management, participatory initiatives, coordination of regional entities and&#13;
water users, consensus building, developing institutional mechanisms for implementing and&#13;
maintaining the REPDA, reservoir operation, flood warning, dam safety, and data&#13;
collection and processing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report 11&#13;
E. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.45  Past Bank Involvement. The Bank has extensive experience in financing water&#13;
projects in Mexico for over 25 years. The water-resources-management-type project is&#13;
somewhat new in the Bank and similar projects just began in Asia during the past three&#13;
years. In fact, the Mexican Water Resources Management Project would the first to&#13;
address all significant aspects of water resources management on a nationwide multi-&#13;
sectoral basis. Project preparation is ongoing on a similar project for Morocco and Brazil.&#13;
Lessons applicable to the proposed project can be drawn from related Bank financed&#13;
water projects in general and from the irrigation and water supply and sanitation projects&#13;
in Mexico in particular.&#13;
1.46 In 1972 the Bank entered into a tripartite agreement with UNDP and GOM to&#13;
prepare the 1975 National Water Plan. The resultant Plan provided a basis for water&#13;
development and management during the ensuing years and has proved to be extremely&#13;
valuable in outlining the general direction for these activities. Although the plan was&#13;
integral and considered most aspects, it emphasized water development and the&#13;
construction of infrastructure. The major portion of the hydraulic infrastructure and&#13;
irrigation projects built since 1975 were discussed in the Plan.&#13;
1.47  The proposed project, without any duplication of actions, would be a sequence and&#13;
follow-up of actions initiated in 1991 with Bank support to CNA through three main on-&#13;
going operations, the Irrigation and Drainage Sector Project, Loan 3419-ME (IDSP)&#13;
(1991), the On-Farm and Minor Irrigation Networks Improvement Project, Loan 3704-&#13;
ME (OFMIN) (1994) and Second Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, Loan&#13;
3751-ME (SWSSS) (1994). The focus ofthe first two projects, geographically located in&#13;
the Irrigation Districts, is: limited public role, decentralization, efficient budget allocation,&#13;
shared private investment and economically efficient use of water resources. The third&#13;
project is directed toward supporting the decentralization and self-sustainability of local&#13;
water and sanitation utilities (Organismos Operativos). The new proposed project would&#13;
complement the previous ones, including applying the provisions of the LAN and its&#13;
regulations under a broader watershed and intersectoral scope to improve integrated,&#13;
economically efficient and environmentally sustainable water use through better&#13;
management.&#13;
1.48  Irrigation and Drainage Projects in Mexico. During the past 25 years, Mexico&#13;
has received 20 Bank loans for the irrigation and drainage subsector, amounting to about&#13;
US$1.4 billion. These projects, excluding the IDSP, contributed to the creation of about&#13;
500,000 ha of irrigated land and to rehabilitation of an additional 900,000 ha in northern&#13;
Mexico. Relevant lessons learned from the last five operations, including preparation of&#13;
the on-going IDSP and OFNIN have been reflected in recommendations and incorporated&#13;
in the design of this project. Decentralization and privatization of the operation and&#13;
maintenance functions in the irrigation sector have been very positive and must be&#13;
encouraged in other areas of water resources use and-management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
1.49 The IDSP project results so far have been rated "satisfactory." The key project&#13;
implementing indicators related to policy like the transfer of irrigation districts to water&#13;
user organizations and operation and maintenance self-sufficiency are ahead of schedule.&#13;
The major current problems are related to a lack of Government counterpart funds.&#13;
1.50 Water Supply and Sanitation Projects in Mexico. Bank involvement in the&#13;
water supply and sanitation sector started in 1973 with the approval of the first water&#13;
supply loan. To date, six loans totaling about US$675 million have been made. The first&#13;
loan was to build bulk water supply facilities for Mexico City. The next three loans were&#13;
to finance physical improvements in various medium-sized cities. The fifth loan, aimed at&#13;
supporting water and sanitation facilities and productive opportunities for women, never&#13;
became effective and was canceled. The sixth loan is the on-going SWSSS. The first four&#13;
projects achieved their physical targets but, the institutional and financial objectives were&#13;
not attained. However, under the ongoing sector loan, better progress has been made in&#13;
attaining those objectives. The project aimed correctly at formulating and implementing&#13;
policies of decentralization that are now in effect. It reduced Government participation in&#13;
the financing of the sector. For the first time, beneficiaries are participating to a partial&#13;
degree in the design and decision mechanisms for the formulation of subprojects.&#13;
Financial self-sufficiency is being more closely achieved by increasing the amount of&#13;
collection and the cost effectiveness of actions.&#13;
1.51  Water Resources Operations in Asia. Four similar water projects in Asia&#13;
provide good preparation experience for the proposed project. They are: (a) National&#13;
Hydrology Project in India (SAR, July 14, 1995); (b) the Irrigation and Water Resources&#13;
Management Project in Indonesia (currently in the initial stages of implementation); (c)&#13;
National drainage Program in Pakistan; and (d) two Dam Safety Projects, one in Indonesia&#13;
and the other in India (both currently in implementation).&#13;
1.52 Lessons Learned. Summary of Recommendations. The main lessons learned&#13;
from other Bank financed projects are: (a) CNA staff participation should be ensured&#13;
from the early stages of project preparation, through appraisal and into implementation;&#13;
(b) implementation schedules should be realistic and achievable; (c) improvements to field&#13;
monitoring networks should include establishing and implementing adequate operation and&#13;

F. WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT WORLD BANK POLICY PAPER, 1993&#13;
1.54 Mexico's national water policy and water management objectives are in close&#13;
accord with Bank policy as enunciated in the Water Resources Management: A World&#13;
Bank Policy Paper, Washington DC, September 1993. The Policy Paper and the Mexican&#13;
water resources management program (as reflected in the National Water Plan 1995-&#13;
2000) and in the LAN recognize that water is an economic good and therefore should be&#13;
managed in an efficient manner. In order to do this, governments should develop and&#13;
implement comprehensive policy frameworks including institutional reforms leading to&#13;
sustainable water resources development and management. The framework and reforms&#13;
should be directed towards: (a) harnessing the efficiency of market forces;&#13;
(b) strengthening the capacity of governments to carry out their essential roles;&#13;
(c) decentralizing water management activities; and (d) promoting stakeholder&#13;
participation. Water resources planning and management should be carried out&#13;
considering the interrelationships between water, land and human resources with the&#13;
objective of enhancing economic growth and development in an environmentally&#13;
sustainable manner.&#13;
1.55  The Policy Paper and the Mexican water resources management program identify&#13;
the river basin as the appropriate unit for water resources planning and management. At&#13;
the river basin level, comprehensive plans should be developed in the context of a broad&#13;
strategy which considers the responsibilities and activities of all participants in water use&#13;
and management, while fully taking into account the ecosystems and socioeconomic&#13;
structures that exist in the river basin. The planning process should deal with cross-&#13;
sectoral issues with the goal of ensuring the sustainabiity of the water environment for&#13;
multiple uses as an integral part of the country's economic development process.&#13;
1.56 The Policy Paper and the Mexican water resources management program&#13;
emphasize the need for reliable data, in many cases real-time, for good water resources&#13;
management. Necessary steps in defining adequate information systems should include:&#13;
identifying users of data, defining information needs, selecting appropriate data collection&#13;
technologies, and establishing national data banks.&#13;
1.57  The need for institution and human resources capacity building are identified in the&#13;
Policy Paper and in the Mexican water resources management program as important&#13;
elements in an overall water resources management strategy. Also, insuring adequate&#13;
financing is essential to developing, implementing and sustaining a water resources&#13;
management program.&#13;

2.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. ORIGIN&#13;
2.1   The project evolved out of a long-term strategy of lending to the Mexican water&#13;
sector as discussed in paras. 1.46 through 1.50. The project was conceived in order to&#13;
assist the GOM in meeting the objectives of the LAN and its regulations. An initial&#13;
identification mission went to Mexico in September, 1994 when the overall project&#13;
objectives, components and preparation report requirements were defined. Because of the&#13;
change of administration and the financial/economic crisis that began in December, 1994,&#13;
project preparation was curtailed until July, 1995 when another identification mission was&#13;
carried out. Between then and the appraisal mission in February, 1996, preparation&#13;
activities were continuous and intense.&#13;
2.2   To support project preparation, the government of Japan approved a Policy and&#13;
Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund in the amount of 72 million yen&#13;
(US$680,000). This grant has been used to finance various project preparation activities&#13;
including technical consultants and study tours which have helped to focus on the&#13;
definition of numerous technical aspects of project preparation.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN CONCEPTS&#13;
2.3   The WRMP objectives are directly in line with the National Water Plan 1995-2000&#13;
and are within the legal framework provided by the LAN. The general objectives are to:&#13;
(a) promote conditions for environmentally sustainable, economically efficient and&#13;
equitably allocated use of water resources in Mexico; (b) support the integrated&#13;
comprehensive management of water resources; and (c) increase the benefits and reduce&#13;
the risk related to existing hydraulic infrastructure.&#13;
2.4   Secondary project objectives are to: (a) support groundwater conservation by&#13;
reducing overexploitation and contamination; (b) promote the restoration of surface water&#13;
quality; (c) improve meteorological services for improved water management and for the&#13;
society and economy as a whole; (d) reduce flood damages downstream of reservoirs; (e)&#13;
improve dam safety; (f) improve allocation of water as an economic good; (g) promote&#13;
decentralization of water resources management through the establishment and&#13;
strengthening of river basin councils; (h) improve water resources planning through the&#13;
development of the hydrographic region plans with river basin council participation; and&#13;
(i) improve water rights administration through registry of water rights users and&#13;
improved fee collection.&#13;
2.5   The proposed project buttresses GOM water sector policies by supporting the&#13;
establishment of streamlined and efficient water rights administration in accordance with&#13;
the LAN, and thus creating the main tools and conditions for an operational tradable water&#13;
rights system (water markets). These are required to: (a) facilitate the reallocation of&#13;
water to more economically efficient uses in a voluntary manner; (b) facilitate the transfer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MENICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report         15&#13;
of O&amp;M to water users and encourage private investment; and (c) ensure equitable&#13;
compensation for water right transactions through market mechanisms.&#13;
2.6   The thrust of the project objectives involves the Bank's assistance in the process of&#13;
formulating basin water plans, the development of decentralized and market-based policies&#13;
designed to provide incentives for the conservation and efficient use of water resources,&#13;
and assisting CNA in the adoption of appropriate technologies, the monitoring of water&#13;
quantity and quality, reservoir operation and aquifer management, and dam safety&#13;
programs. (See Annex H, Tables H-I and H-2 for correlations between project objectives&#13;
and components and subcomponents.)&#13;
2.7   Historically water planning and management has been highly centralized in Mexico.&#13;
With the gradual establishment of River Basin Councils and the corresponding&#13;
decentralization of water resources planning and management, the role of CNA will&#13;
undergo considerable change. At the central level, CNA will coordinate the development&#13;
of water policy and strategy in the context of government objectives in the areas of&#13;
economic development, social well being, environmental protection, public health, rural&#13;
and urban planning, decentralization and international treaty obligations. At the regional&#13;
levels, CNA will support the River Basin Councils by providing them with technical&#13;
support in the areas of water resources monitoring, planning, assessments and&#13;
management. Regionally, CNA will also function as the Water Authority, registering&#13;
water rights and transfers, and monitoring compliance with the LAN. The project would&#13;
support major decentralization activities within CNA whereby the regional offices will&#13;
undergo significant change to assume the principle role of water resources planning and&#13;
management, all within the context of the river basin. These offices will be responsible for&#13;
regional water resources planning and management, for promoting the establishment of&#13;
river basin councils, for coordinating activities within the hydrographic regions basins of&#13;
the various stakeholders and for water rights administration. The implementation of the&#13;
project components and subcomponents will be within the framework of the river basin&#13;
planning and management activities and will complement and enhance those efforts. The&#13;
regional offices will play a key role in defining the actions to be taken within their area of&#13;
influence. Thirteen regional project implementation plans will be prepared to detail&#13;
implementation activities in each of the thirteen new regional offices that are in the process&#13;
of being organized.&#13;
2.8   Regional offices will also be strengthened in their roles of providing the direct&#13;
contact with water users for water rights administration, data collection and processing,&#13;
data bank maintenance, operation and maintenance of data collection networks, and&#13;
operation and maintenance of hydraulic infrastructure.&#13;
2.9   In order to adequately implement the project, CNA will require an estimated 543&#13;
new professionals to be recruited from the outside to enable the different project areas to&#13;
implement the project. An additional approximate 79 permanent professionals, 235&#13;
temporary professionals (for 2 years to assist in the one-time program for the registration&#13;
of water rights) and 102 technicians would be brought into the project related units from&#13;
other parts of CNA. The total 724 (543 + 79 + 102) that would be brought into the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
project related units on a permanent basis would be offset by an equal number of present&#13;
employees which would leave during the 6-year period, mostly by attrition.&#13;
2.10  Project Design. The project is designed to assist the GOM improve its water&#13;
resources policies and management capabilities to: (a) provide the key public goods&#13;
function necessary for the sustainable use and improved intersectoral allocation of the&#13;
water resources; and (b) aid water users in general through an improved policy&#13;
environment. The project would not include direct investment activities such as:&#13;
(a) construction of hydraulic infrastructure; (b) implementation of water quality&#13;
improvement plans; (c) implementation of groundwater stabilization plans;&#13;
(d) implementation of regional water resources plans; and (e) remedial action on existing&#13;
dams with safety problems. To maximize the effectiveness of the project, follow-on&#13;
projects in these areas will be needed. Technical assistance and consultant support&#13;
activities have been included in the project to support preparation activities for follow-on&#13;
projects.&#13;
2.11  The project would be implemented such that the various components and&#13;
subcomponents are necessary parts of an integrated whole. This would be achieved by&#13;
establishing three full-time professional staff positions in CNA's General Subdirectorate&#13;
for Planning (Subdirecci6n General de Programaci6n - SGP) which would be responsible&#13;
for coordinating and focusing activities throughout CNA, with other government entities&#13;
and private stakeholders (see para. 6.1 (a)). The SGP would ensure that the pace and&#13;
focus of implementation will serve the project objectives.&#13;

management. CNA wide telecommunications and computer networks/systems would be&#13;
installed to improve information technologies.&#13;
D. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.17  The Bank's past involvement in the irrigation and water sector puts it in an unique&#13;
position to support strongly the on-going decentralization process in Mexico. The&#13;
proposed project is also an obvious extension of GOM/Bank work initiated in the&#13;
irrigation and water and sanitation subsectors and provides a basic institutional and&#13;
technical framework to improve and continue the reforms in the water sector.&#13;
2.18  The objectives of the WRMP are directly in-line vith the Bank's objectives for&#13;
supporting member government initiatives in water resources management. The Bank is&#13;
committed "...to focus its efforts on countries where significant problems exist or are&#13;
emerging involving water scarcity, service efficiency, water allocation, or environmental&#13;
damage" (Water Resources Management: A World Bank Policy Paper, Washington DC,&#13;
September 1993 atp. 21). Water scarcity conditions in Mexico effectively mirror those of&#13;
primary interest for the Bank's policies. In more operational terms, Bank policy makes&#13;
clear that "its economic sector work, lending, technical assistance, and participation in&#13;
international initiatives will aim to promote policy and regulatory reforms; institution&#13;
adaptation and capacity building; environmental protection and restoration..." (at p. 65).&#13;
Institutional capacity building and adaptation, and regulatory/procedural reform and&#13;
improvements related to water resources planning, management and use and&#13;
environmental protection form the core of the ends sought in the WRMP.&#13;
2.19  The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy for&#13;
Mexico presented to the Board on May 22, 1995 (Report No. 14518-ME). The strategy&#13;
aims at assisting Mexico to manage the ongoing economic/financial crisis while continuing&#13;
to support longer range programs that contribute to reductions in poverty, environmental&#13;
improvements and encouraging long term sustainable growth and development,&#13;
particularly through investments in human resources, infrastructure and natural resource&#13;
management. The strategy also aims to extend the reform process downward to regional&#13;
and state levels and support the further devolution of expenditures and responsibilities to&#13;
these decentralized levels. Working within this strategy, the proposed project is&#13;
specifically aimed at developing capacities to decentralize and improve water resources&#13;
management functions, address environmental and water management issues at the river&#13;
basin level, monitor and manage water quality and quantity, improve intersectoral&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
allocation and protect the country's scarce water resources, all while economic growth&#13;
continues in a sustainable manner.&#13;
2.20  The project would support: (a) decentralization by aiding in the formation and&#13;
strengthening of river basin councils and in the regional planning and water management&#13;
activities of CNA; (b) economic growth by facilitating the reallocation of water to more&#13;
efficient uses through the establishment of water markets and thereby ensure water&#13;
availability in a scarce water environment; (c) environmentally sustainable use and&#13;
development by: (i) improving water resources planning and management at the regional&#13;
level in a participatory manner, (ii) improving water quality by better monitoring and&#13;
regulation of dischargers, and (iii) reduced aquifer overexploitation through improved&#13;
monitoring and regulation; (d) social well-being by: (i) improved reservoir operation&#13;
during floods and droughts, (ii) improved dam safety, and (iii) improved water availability;&#13;
and (e) poverty alleviation by empowering the poor through the legal registry of water&#13;
rights and improved water management.&#13;
2.21  The river basin councils will provide a forum for water users, other stakeholders,&#13;
state and local governments, federal entities in addition to CNA to express their opinion in&#13;
water resources planning and management activities in a dynamic iterative manner. Input&#13;
into decision making on policies, strategies, alternative actions, and investment and&#13;
management plans will be sought and stimulated through the river basin councils. This&#13;
process will facilitate the decentralization of decision making and water resources planning&#13;
and management activities.&#13;
E. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES&#13;
2.22  As described above, the proposed project has been categorized as belonging to&#13;
Sustainable Economic Development Category. It is not expected to be included in the&#13;
Poverty Category: Program of Targeted Intervention. However, improved water&#13;
management and the provision of legal water rights to small farmers will significantly&#13;
improve the quality of life of a large number of poor individuals and families&#13;

3. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING.&#13;
A. COSTS&#13;
3.1   Total project costs including contingencies and taxes are estimated at about&#13;
US$342 million equivalent, (see Annex I, Table 1.1).&#13;
3.2   Baseline costs are estimated at US$305.7 million and physical contingencies at&#13;
US$10.3 million or 3% of total baseline project costs. Price contingencies between&#13;
negotiations and project completion were estimated at US$25.9 million equivalent, or&#13;
about 9% of project baseline costs plus physical contingencies. Annual price increases&#13;
were applied to foreign costs in all categories in US dollar terms at a rate of 2.6%.&#13;
Annual price increases for local costs were calculated using rates estimated by LAMXC of&#13;
28.9% for 1996, 12.4% for 1997, 8.1% for 1998, 5.5% for 1999, 4.7% for 2000 and&#13;
4.7% for 2001. Foreign and local price contingencies were expressed in US dollar&#13;
equivalents, assuming purchasing power parity during the six-year disbursement period.&#13;
Physical and price contingencies were estimated at 12% of the baseline costs.&#13;
B. FINANCING&#13;
3.3   The proposed Bank loan of US$186.5 million would finance about 54.5% of total&#13;
costs including taxes and duties. The breakdown by category is 100% for foreign&#13;
expenditures for equipment and 87% for local expenditures for equipment; consultants&#13;
100%; training 100%; incremental operating costs for IMTA at a declining percentage of&#13;
85%, 60% and 25%; and 0% of civil works, vehicles and other incremental recurrent&#13;
costs, all net of taxes (Annex I, Table I.8). The loan will be made to Nacional Financiera,&#13;
S.N.C. (NAFIN), which will sign an agreement with the Government to permit the&#13;
transfer of the loan proceeds to the executing agency (CNA) as a condition of Loan&#13;
effectiveness. (See para. 6.2.) The balance of US$155.5 million (45.5 of costs not&#13;
covered by the Loan) will be financed by GOM through its annual budgetary process to&#13;
CNA.&#13;
3.4   Foreign exchange accounts for 31.5% of the costs of the project. The Bank will&#13;
cover an amount equivalent to the total amount of foreign exchange costs (US$107.7&#13;
million) plus US$78.8 million of the local costs (excluding taxes), bringing Bank&#13;
participation in aggregate up to 54.5% of total project costs.&#13;

3.5      The terms of the loan will be repayment over 15 years, including three years grace,&#13;
at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans.&#13;
3.6      The project will support major improvements in ongoing CNA  activities. Because&#13;
of this, the annual budgeted amounts will need to cover, for each of the technical areas,&#13;
costs of: (a) non-incremental WRMIP related activities; (b) GOM counterpart activities&#13;
(incremental recurrent activities, civil works, vehicles, taxes); and (c) Bank financed&#13;
WRMP activities. Table I presents estimates of total budget requirements for each year of&#13;
project implementation including retroactively financed activities in 1996.&#13;

reporting requirements. This staff will include a coordinator, two assistants and necessary&#13;
support staff (see para. 6.1(a)). Additionally, project coordination would be supported by&#13;
a consulting firm that would be responsible for monitoring, evaluation and project&#13;
reporting. As with other Bank financed CNA projects, project procurement would be&#13;
carried out through the SGA for official review and approval and through the Financing&#13;
Group (Gerencia de Financiamiento - GF) of SGP for processing with NAFIN.&#13;
Additionally, an official will be appointed in each regional office to coordinate project&#13;
activities within the region and with other parts of CNA. Each general subdirectorate&#13;
(SGP, SGT and SGAA) will have an individual designated to be responsible for&#13;
coordinating project activities. At negotiations, assurances were provided that the&#13;
Government agrees to maintain the coordination functions, structure and staff.&#13;
B. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.3   The Bank will help finance contracts related to the implementation of the selected&#13;
subprojects provided that: adequate counterpart funds are allocated every year to the&#13;
project; and the procurement of goods is carried out in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines (January, 1995). CNA would be responsible for all the&#13;
procurement of items to be financed by the Bank. Standard bidding documents issued by&#13;
the Bank will be used for ICB. Standard bidding documents agreed to by the Bank and the&#13;
GOM wil be used for the procurement of goods under NCB. Procurement plans for 1996&#13;
and 1997 have been prepared by CNA and were reviewed and approved by the Bank&#13;
during project appraisal.&#13;
4.4   Works. Civil works will include: (a) installation of hydrologic, meteorological&#13;
and groundwater monitoring stations and equipment; (b) construction/renovation of water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report               29&#13;
quality laboratories; (c) minor protection works and instrumentation of selected dams; and&#13;
(d) field surveys and engineering services. The Bank would not finance any civil works.&#13;

4.5    Goods. The goods to be procured under the project are split into three major&#13;
subcategories: (a) monitoring equipment (hydrometric, meteorological, water quality,&#13;
groundwater, dams instrumentation, etc.); (b) water quality laboratory equipment; and&#13;
(c) telemetry, telecommunications equipment and computer hardware and software, which&#13;
would be procured under ICB procedures involving major packages of equipment valued&#13;
at not less than US$1.0 million equivalent per package to encourage competition.&#13;
Contracts for goods estimated to cost more than US$350,000 equivalent would be&#13;
procured through ICB procedures in accordance with Bank Guidelines. The procurement&#13;
of goods valued below US$350,000 would be through NCB procedures up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$15.0 million equivalent. Contracts valued below US$50,000,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

at least three bidders up to an aggregate amount of to US$1.1 million equivalent. Vehicles&#13;
will not be financed by the Bank.&#13;
4.6   In view of their specialized unique capabilities, technology transfer experience and&#13;
good results in previous and on-going similar activities worldwide, CNA plans to contract&#13;
directly (single source) with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the&#13;
United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather&#13;
Service (NOAA/NWS) for an estimated amount of US$3 million in each case to provide&#13;
technical assistance in the areas of meteorology, hydrology, water quality and information&#13;
technology (see paras. 6.1(a) and 6.4(a)). WMO is the only multilateral institutional with&#13;
broad experience in providing technical assistance in procurement of goods and&#13;
implementation of technical programs in the areas of meteorology, hydrology, water&#13;
quality, telecommunications and computer networks. NOAA/NWS would provide&#13;
technical assistance in the installation and use of NOAA/NWS models for rainfall/runoff,&#13;
hydrological and rainfall forecasting and decision support systems. They would provide&#13;
the models free of charge. These models are the best available in the world to meet&#13;
CNA's particular needs. CNA has long relationships with both WMO and NOAA/NWS&#13;
and intends to continue these relationships through this technical assistance. Other&#13;
international institutions with which agreements could be reached and that could provide&#13;
technical assistance to CNA include UNDP, FAO, USGS, USBR, COE, EPA,&#13;
BCHYDRO, EC, MET, [NM, OEE, all of which have specialized capabilities in their areas&#13;
of responsibilities. Additionally, national institutions with which agreements could be&#13;
reached and that could provide technical assistance to CNA include II, CCA and CFE,&#13;
which have specialized capabilities in their areas of responsibilities. Bank financing of&#13;
these activities would be permitted if selection procedures are acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Several World Bank member countries have expressed interest in supporting project&#13;
implementation including partial financing of activities. On a case by case basis, the Bank&#13;
will consider financing the GOM portion of these activities as defined in bi-lateral&#13;
agreements that would be reached, if selection procedures are acceptable to the Bank. For&#13;
these purposes an appropriate provision has been left in the unallocated category of the&#13;
loan.&#13;
4.7   The selection and appointment of consultants for training, studies, designs and&#13;
supervision of works will follow the August 1981 Bank Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants. Small contracts with consulting engineering firms for assignments of a simple&#13;
nature (e.g., supervision of works) below US$100,000 and for individual consultants&#13;
below US$50,000, would be exempted from Bank's prior review of selection procedures&#13;
and contract conditions, but would be subject to ex-post selective review during&#13;
supervisions. However, all terms of reference for consulting services would require prior&#13;
review by the Bank. Contracts for consultants are expected to aggregate to about&#13;
US$100.1 million. This includes engineering services in areas such as installation,&#13;
upgrading, and start-up operation and maintenance of monitoring networks which are&#13;
expected to aggregate to about US$45 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MEXICO - Water Resources Management ProjectlStaff Appraisal Report          3 1&#13;
4.8   Bank's prior review would apply to: (a) all contracts for goods awarded through&#13;
ICB; (b) the first two contracts each year for goods under NCB regardless of value; and&#13;
(c) all consultant contracts with firms above US$100,000 and all consultant contracts with&#13;
individuals above US$50,000. All other contracts would be subject to ex-post review by&#13;
the Bank during supervision on a selective basis. The proposed review arrangements are&#13;
expected to result in a prior review coverage level of about 70% of Bank-financed&#13;
contracts.&#13;

C. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.9   Bank financing (about 54.5% of the total project cost) will be for goods and&#13;
services. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2001, and the Loan&#13;
closing date is June 30, 2002. NAFIN will establish a Special Account in Banco de&#13;
Mexico, with an authorized allocation of US$10 million, equal to about four months'&#13;
estimated average disbursements, under established procedures between the Bank and the&#13;
Government of Mexico. The first advance to the special account would be limited,&#13;
however, to US$5 million to cover estimated expenditures in the first months of project&#13;
implementation. The full amount of the authorized allocation would be available once&#13;
total disbursements reach US$33 million. The special account would be replenished&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
monthly in order to assure liquidity and a regular reporting on use of the funds.&#13;
Disbursements from the Loan account will be made on 100% for foreign expenditures for&#13;
goods; 87% for local expenditures for goods; 100% for consultants and training; and&#13;
incremental operating costs for IMTA at a declining percentage of 85%, 60% and 25%.&#13;
Disbursements against goods contracts below the prior review limits and consultant&#13;
services with firms below US$100,000 and with individuals below US$50,000 will be&#13;
made on the basis of SOEs, except for the first two contracts each year for goods under&#13;
NCB. SOEs may also be used for incremental operating costs and selected training&#13;
related expenditures. Disbursements against contracts for goods above the respective&#13;
prior review limits will be made against full documentation submitted to the Bank. In&#13;
view of the desirability of starting the project without delay, retroactive financing up to&#13;
US$18.6 million equivalent (10% of Loan funds) is proposed for expenditures incurred&#13;
after March 8, 1996. Retroactive financing will be used for preparation of studies,&#13;
training, engineering services, technical assistance and the purchase of some monitoring&#13;
and computer equipment.&#13;
D. AccouNTs AND AUDITS&#13;
4.10 CNA will maintain project accounts. All accounts will adequately reflect&#13;
expenditures made in respect of the project, in accordance with sound accounting&#13;
practices acceptable to the Bank. A certified copy of the project audit, covering CNA and&#13;
IMTA activities (including the participating Regional Offices) prepared by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Bank, and in accordance with the March 1982 Bank document&#13;
"Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World&#13;
Bank," will be submitted to the Bank not more than six months after the completion of&#13;
each fiscal year. The audit report will include a separate opinion by the auditor on&#13;
disbursements against certified statements of expenditure. Statements of expenditure and&#13;
other audit-related material will be made available to Bank supervision missions. At&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government will have the project accounts&#13;
audited using procedures acceptable to the Bank, in line with the Bank/Mexico Audit&#13;
Agreement of November, 1991 with SECODAM (see para. 6. 1(b)).&#13;
E. MONITORING OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND BANK SUPERVISION&#13;
4.11  CNA will prepare comprehensive project reports two times a year. These would&#13;
cover all aspects of physical and financial implementation and indicators related to project&#13;
objectives (Annex H, Table H-3). Additionally, Table H-4 in Annex H presents a summary&#13;
of the most important input, output, outcome and impact indicators. These principal&#13;
indicators were developed to monitor the projects overall progress in progressing through&#13;
a hierarchy of accomplishments, including the impacts related to the main objectives of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.12 Monitoring of project implementation should be facilitated by the fact that the&#13;
CNA is well-established and has effective procedures for project implementation. During&#13;
the first year, supervision would focus on: progress of training programs; and adequacy of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report         33&#13;
project coordination and the Project Management System (PMS) as described in Annex&#13;
H. CNA will produce the semiannual reports prepared by the coordination staff. There&#13;
will be at least two Bank supervision missions annually. Each supervision mission will&#13;
include field visits to regional offices, and visits to training sites, laboratories, survey areas,&#13;
etc. Data from the PMS on implementation will be the basis of supervision, reviewing the&#13;
progress in the semester by reviewing the tables presented in the quarterly reports,&#13;
complemented by other information as required. At negotiations assurances were&#13;
obtained that a midterm review will take place no later than May 31, 1999 (combined with&#13;
the Semi-Annual Mission), after the second year of project implementation (see para.&#13;
6. 1 (c)).&#13;
4.13 Because results from this type of project become available gradually during&#13;
implementation, it is not possible to supervise the project initially (during the first year)&#13;
with all the indicators required to measure impact. Supervision, therefore, concentrates&#13;
first on budgetary availability, and indicators that the project is being physically&#13;
implemented. Later, as data become available about project costs and returns, real&#13;
measures of the impact will be derived from work supported by the operation.&#13;
4.14 Indicators related to project objectives. At negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that the Government agrees on a set of indicators related to project objectives&#13;
(see Annex H, Table H-3) and on a hierarchical tree of primary indicators (see Annex H,&#13;
Table H-4) to measure overall project progress in meeting project objectives (see para.&#13;
6. 1(d)).&#13;
4.15 Annual Cost Estimates, and Work and Procurement Plan. At negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained that the executing agency (CNA) will present to the Bank an&#13;
annual work and procurement plan including cost estimates no later than November 30 of&#13;
each year, describing the work to be done in the following project year. (See para. 6. 1(e).)&#13;
During project appraisal CNA provided an annual work and procurement plan describing&#13;
the work to be done during the remainder of 1996. During project appraisal, assurances&#13;
were obtained that the Government will submit to congress the required budget sufficient&#13;
to implement the project as presented in this SAR. Subsequent annual plans and cost&#13;
estimates and budgets will be reviewed by Bank missions.&#13;
4.16 Annual Budget and Planning Review. At negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that the annual budget and planning review will take place no later than May 31&#13;
of each year (see para. 6.1 (f)). That review would analyze the legislatively-approved&#13;
budget and proposed legally-binding work and procurement plan for the upcoming year,&#13;
discuss those plans with respect to the project's implementation indicators, and agree on&#13;
necessary changes in implementation. The annual budget and planning review would&#13;
analyze the annual cost estimates and work and procurement plan and data from the PMS.&#13;
It would analyze the training component and activities with data provided by the&#13;
supervision. Semiannual reports covering project activities in all components (see para.&#13;
6. l(g)) will be presented each semester. The project coordination staff will manage&#13;
production of the reports in collaboration with the executing technical units. The annual&#13;
reviews will be based on the November 30 Report which would include the work and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
procurement plan for the upcoming year, including goals for implementation indicators&#13;
which ifjustified may include adjustments from previously planned goals for that year. If&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, the work and procurement plan and indicators would be approved&#13;
at the annual budget and planning review and become legally binding for the subsequent&#13;
year.&#13;
4.17  Project Midterm Review. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that the&#13;
Government would hold a midterm review no later than May 31, 1999 (see para. 6. 1(c)).&#13;
The midterm review will also constitute the annual budget and planning review for 1999.&#13;
The midterm review will examine progress with project implementation in all components,&#13;
based on the implementation and financial indicators, and will analyze economic results&#13;
and technical quality of improvements, and project progress in meeting overall objectives&#13;
(Annex H, Table H-3 and H-4). The review will examine the results of the training,&#13;
technological support and institutional development program; the strengthening of SGT,&#13;
SGP, SGAA, regional offices, the establishment and strengthening of river basin councils;&#13;
the communication program and technical assistance; and experience with project&#13;
institutional arrangements. The effectiveness of integrated water management initiatives&#13;
will be a major input for the midterm review. Technical and financial sustainability of&#13;
water management activities will be a major consideration during the midterm review.&#13;
Data will include all information about project costs and activities, observed or expected&#13;
benefits from those activities and financing. All data will be completed for the first&#13;
24 months of project implementation. Based on this analysis, the review would&#13;
recommend adjustments in project implementation and a schedule to implement these&#13;
adjustments.&#13;
4.18 Project Launch Seminar. A Project Launch Seminar would be held within three&#13;
months of Loan effectiveness to assist with technical, management and institutional&#13;
orientation. Particular emphasis would be given to: (a) initiating project operational,&#13;
supervision, coordination and management aspects; (b) reviewing and supervising ongoing&#13;
technical activities under retroactive financing; and (c) reviewing and approving terms of&#13;
reference for activities to be carried out during the first year of Project implementation.&#13;
5.   PROJECT ANALYSIS&#13;
A. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   The project is mainly related to the public goods aspect and is expected to cover&#13;
all the national territory through its five main components. It would benefit all Mexicans&#13;
through improved weather forecasts and water management because all are subject to&#13;
climatological effects and all are water users. To a larger extent it would benefit the 75%&#13;
of the Mexican population that resides in arid and semi-arid regions and approximately&#13;
750,000 irrigation farmers (through a register of relevant tradable water rights), and over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report           35&#13;
500 urban areas and over 25,000 industries (through dependable water resources&#13;
allocation and improved water quality).&#13;
5.2   The project would generate significant benefits by improving water resources&#13;
management through improved data collection, processing and evaluations; improved&#13;
reservoir operation and dam safety; establishing institutional mechanisms and technical&#13;
procedures for water resources planning and management at the river basin level; and&#13;
improved water rights administration. The project will improve weather forecasting which&#13;
will not only benefit water management, but also Mexican society and economy as a&#13;
whole. The project can be expected to generate substantial benefits via the enhancement&#13;
of meteorological and hydrological information that is used for investment planning in the&#13;
water resources sector, and for the operation management and planning of both surface&#13;
and groundwater systems. Moreover, substantial benefits will derive from the&#13;
implementation of tradable water rights systems, a critical prerequisite for which is the&#13;
Project-supported completion of the REPDA. A strengthening of monitoring in the areas&#13;
of water pollution from municipal and industrial discharges, an important activity&#13;
contemplated in the Project, will contribute greatly to the GOM's efforts to improve water&#13;
quality in Mexico. The project will significantly contribute to improvements in the&#13;
environment and to poverty alleviation.&#13;
5.3   Projects like the WRMP do not generate benefits of the sort typically included in&#13;
cost-benefit analyses. It would produce information and technical capabilities, used in&#13;
decision-making processes. Such processes are in the area of the operation and&#13;
management of natural resources and environmental systems, and in the design and&#13;
implementation of public investment programs. This being the case, the economic&#13;
justification of the Project is explored using a method that draws on the "risk assessment"&#13;
approach (see Annex G). Thus, inferential responses are developed to the following two&#13;
related questions that are of obvious relevance for an assessment of the feasibility of the&#13;
Project: (a) what is the minimum value of benefits required for an acceptable ratio of&#13;
benefits to costs, and (b) are there compelling reasons for expecting that the Project would&#13;
yield benefits that are at least as great as these values.&#13;
5.4   Ex-post analyses of investment programs designed to improve the reliability of&#13;
hydrological and meteorological information and analysis in many countries throughout&#13;
the world suggest that programs like the WRMP yield benefits that greatly exceed costs.&#13;
Anecdotal evidence of the potential benefits of the project (see Annex G) which highlights&#13;
specific instances in which real-time access to more reliable information and evaluations&#13;
would have resulted in obvious benefits to Mexican society, strengthen the case for&#13;
viewing the Project as economically feasible. For both individual Project components and&#13;
the overall Project, using data that significantly understate the potential values relevant for&#13;
Mexico, it is clear that the Project's feasibility requires only the most modest expectations&#13;
for its success in affecting values of social significance in Mexico. Thus, annualized costs&#13;
for the overall project are 230 million NP (US$30. I million--using an exchange rate of 7.5&#13;
NP = US$1), and measurable values served by the Project (which substantially&#13;
underestimate the actual range of values served by the Project) total 129,047 million NP&#13;
(US$17.206 billion). Economic feasibility requires that the Project affect -- increase --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
values served by the Project by only two-tenths of one percent (0.2%); values served are&#13;
expected to increase many times that amount (see Annex G).&#13;
5.5   The project has been designed to minimize investment in new monitoring networks&#13;
and equipment and to maximize the utilization of existing facilities. Considerable&#13;
improvements in water resources planning and management will be achieved through&#13;
improvements in existing facilities and improved technical evaluations and modeling of&#13;
water systems. Expansion of networks and systems will be limited and gradual. This&#13;
approach will ensure a process whereby large benefits will be realized for relatively small&#13;
costs.&#13;
5.6   The project would improve the: (a) monitoring, evaluation and management of&#13;
144 aquifers; (b) monitoring, evaluation and management of water quality in 435 water&#13;
bodies; (c) hydrological forecasting and reservoir operation in 19 river basins; (d) 5,000&#13;
dam safety inspections; (e) weather forecasting in all parts of the country; (f) regional&#13;
water resources planning and management and the establishment and strengthening of 13&#13;
river basin councils; and (g) the registration of 300,000 water users in the REPDA. See&#13;
Annex H, Table H-3 for details.&#13;
5.7   The project would support the consolidation and enforcement of the LAN, to&#13;
strengthen the new federalism by securing water rights to all legal water users, to facilitate&#13;
transaction of water rights, and to improve water fees collection. Additionally, the project&#13;
would support providing a basis and a means for the allocation of water towards more&#13;
productive uses (i.e. improving the economic efficiency of water use) in a dynamic setting&#13;
where water demands are continually changing, while simultaneously protecting against&#13;
aquifer depletion, protecting the water rights of third parties, and reducing water&#13;
pollution. This is to be done by supporting the effective functioning of water markets that&#13;
are developing following the promulgation of the LAN.&#13;
B. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS&#13;
5.8   The project would have a major positive effect on the environment. It would not&#13;
finance any new development nor any new hydraulic infrastructure facilities; there will not&#13;
be, therefore, any major adverse environmental impacts. The proposed project has been&#13;
rated "B" to ensure that sufficient environmental attention and expertise are brought to&#13;
bear in the river regional water resources planning and management aspects. The project&#13;
would offer strong environmental benefits and provide the GOM with tools to: (a) detect&#13;
water contamination and pollution, and establish and enforce discharge standards and&#13;
thereby significantly improve water quality; (b) identify and characterize areas of over&#13;
(unsustainable) use of surface and groundwater, and develop stabilization plans and&#13;
thereby conserve scarce water resources; (c) improve reservoir operation for the benefit of&#13;
aquatic and riparian ecosystems; (d) improve water resources planning at the river basin&#13;
level with the participation of environmental specialists and river basin councils to ensure&#13;
consideration of environmental aspects; and (e) improve allocation of scarce water&#13;
resources and water use efficiency. Each regional office of CNA will have an individual&#13;
&#13;

MEXCO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report          37&#13;
professional trained in environmental/natural resources sciences to oversee environmental&#13;
aspects in these areas (see Annex G).&#13;
C. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.9   The proposed project is expected to have a positive effect on water environment&#13;
related issues, sustainable intersectoral use of water in general, and in the consolidation of&#13;
functions in Mexico. Under the proposed project, the LAN and the new regulatory and&#13;
administrative reforms related to water use will create a set circumstances that will&#13;
facilitate efficient water use and allocation, and thus, sustainable development.&#13;
5.10  The institutional development, technological support and training component has&#13;
the purpose of supporting the development of the institutional and organizational structure&#13;
and the training of human resources necessary to carry out and oversee the water&#13;
resources management functions during and after project implementation. CNA is a&#13;
government entity with no legal or financial autonomy. CNA's financing depends directly&#13;
and only upon annual budget allocations authorized by the Congress and provided through&#13;
SHCP. Although CNA is administratively and technically responsible for water fee&#13;
collections, SHCP authorizes and collects the fees which are paid directly to the Federal&#13;
Treasury. Water fees collected as well as all other monies paid to the Federal Treasury&#13;
have no specific allocation and are not linked to finance activities related to the source.&#13;
Hence, the future costs of sustaining the program after project completion will depend&#13;
upon the budgetary allocation and not on the amount of water fee collection. Because&#13;
CNA is undergoing a transformation from an entity primarily responsible for construction&#13;
and operation of hydraulic works to an organization responsible for overseeing the&#13;
management of the nations water resources, CNA's primary responsibility in the future&#13;
will be water resources management. In the future, because of reduced construction and&#13;
operation and maintenance conmmitments, CNA's overall budget will probably decrease&#13;
significantly, however budget allocations for water resources management should always&#13;
be sufficient because of the priority of these activities. Although it is difficult to quantify&#13;
the expected increases in water fee collections, the increases are expected to be in excess&#13;
of the cost of the project and specifically in excess of the recurrent costs of project related&#13;
water resources management activities after the completion of the project.&#13;
D. POVERTY ALLEVIATION&#13;
5.11  The proposed project has no direct impact on poverty alleviation but its positive&#13;
effects on the environment and high public goods content in both the rural and urban&#13;
contexts will help alleviate poverty indirectly. Sustainable water development and&#13;
management in rural areas can partially provide the necessary conditions to support&#13;
populations in rural areas and thereby reduce migration pressures. Conversely,&#13;
unavailability of water or the deterioration of the quantity or quality of water resources&#13;
can severely impact public health and quality of life, and can be major factors towards&#13;
inducing migrations. Additionally, it has been shown in other parts of the world that&#13;
providing water rights to small irrigators, an aspect that the project will support, provides&#13;

them with legal and economic security, and improves their economic efficiency and their&#13;
well being.&#13;
E. GENDER LMPACT&#13;
5.12 In Mexico, women are the primary family caretakers and users of domestic water.&#13;
For female headed households and many conjugal households, women are also responsible&#13;
for the management of water for farm use. In a 1992 study for the United Nations&#13;
Development Fund for Women it was observed that 30% of the farmsteads within&#13;
Mexican irrigation districts are operated by women. Although the project would have no&#13;
direct investment in irrigation or domestic water delivery or treatment systems, the overall&#13;
improvements in water management will indirectly benefit commnunities and families both&#13;
economically and socially (health). Because of their significant status as water users, it&#13;
would be beneficial for women to have a say in water management activities. The river&#13;
basin councils will have water user representation and the expected presence of some&#13;
women representatives would significantly enhance their effectiveness.&#13;
F. PARTICIPATION ASPECTS&#13;
5.13  One of the central goals of the WRMP would be to promote and foster the&#13;
participation of water users and other stakeholders in the various aspects of water&#13;
resources planning and management. This would be accomplished through the river basin&#13;
councils, as has been initiated positively in the existing Lerma-Chapala River Basin&#13;
Council.&#13;
G. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
5.14  The following four principal risks were identified for the project:&#13;
a) New CNA reforms, project management and coordination. CNA is&#13;
presently embarking on a series of reforms that will involve changes in&#13;
structure, priorities, policies and decentralization programs. Although the&#13;
WRMP is in direct accord with these changes, these reforns, which will take&#13;
place at the same time as project implementation, could impact the project. To&#13;
mitigate the effects of the reforms on project implementation, the project&#13;
would include supervision, coordination and monitoring by the various&#13;
technical units complemented through a project coordination staff in SGP.&#13;
b) Uncertainty regarding budgetary allocations. Project implementation&#13;
depends on adequate budget allocations. In Mexico budgetary allocations have&#13;
faced uncertainty because of economic and financial conditions. During&#13;
appraisal, CNA and SHCP provided assurances that the project was a GOM&#13;
priority and that considerable effort would be exerted in the future to ensure&#13;
that sufficient budgets would be available. In addition, this risk will be&#13;
addressed through monitoring and analyzing CNA annual budget reviews.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MEXICO - Water Resources Management Project/Staff Appraisal Report       39&#13;
c) Decentralization, technical skills and capacity building. Decentralization&#13;
implies that a substantial part of the WRMP will be implemented by the 13 new&#13;
regional offices as these acquire technical and operational capacity. This&#13;
process will require considerable support from CNA to the regional offices in&#13;
capacity building and training. To mitigate this risk the project includes a&#13;
major component, "Institutional Development, Technological Support and&#13;
Training", which would be implemented in the training portion with the&#13;
participation of IMTA.&#13;
5.15 Financial Benefits and Risks. The Borrower has selected LIBOR-based US&#13;
dollar single currency loan terms in order to improve its overall liability management and&#13;
reduce its risks. It considers US dollars to be an appropriate currency for its debt&#13;
management strategy, and prefers the standard country repayment terms for LIBOR-based&#13;
single currency loans compared with the shorter final maturity on fixed-rate single&#13;
currency loans. This loan constitutes about 12% of the US$1.5 billion loan envelope for&#13;
FY 1996 for Mexico.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1   Assurances provided by GOM at negotiations:&#13;

MEXICO&#13;
WATER RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX A: LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK,&#13;
AND INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS&#13;
I. Legal and Regulatory Framework&#13;
1.    The Mexican Constitution initiated modem regulatory jurisdiction of water resources&#13;
in the country. Since its adoption in 1917, a series of laws and regulations have been&#13;
promulgated that have relation to water resources use and management in Mexico. The&#13;
following is a brief description of the various pertinent laws and regulations.&#13;
2.    Article 27 of the Constitution (adopted in 1917) recognizes the Nation as the owner of&#13;
all water within the territory and authorizes the government to administer these resources and&#13;
to grant "concessions" for water use.&#13;
3.    Article 115 of the Constitution (as modified in 1985) grants to the municipal&#13;
governments, with the assistance of the state governments as necessary, the responsibility for&#13;
municipal water delivery systems.&#13;
4.    The National Water Law (Ley de Aguas Nacionales - LAN) enacted in 1992 provides&#13;
the legal framework for water administration and for the granting of water right permits to&#13;
individuals or groups of individuals for periods up to 50 years through the administrative&#13;
authority of the National Water Commission (Comisi6n Nacional del Agua - CNA). Water&#13;
right permits are granted for both the use of water and for discharging water into rivers and&#13;
other water bodies. In the case of discharges, water right permits include water quality&#13;
parameter requirements. These water right permits are transferable and may be bought and&#13;
sold as long as it is determined that the transfer is technically feasible and will not adversely&#13;
impact uncompensated third parties. The LAN establishes a National Public Water Rights&#13;
Register to be maintained by CNA. All water right permits are to be recorded in the register,&#13;
as well as their extensions, modifications, suspensions, terminations and transfers. CNA has&#13;
the authority to fine water users for not having permits or for using or discharging water not&#13;
in accordance with their permits.&#13;
5.    The Regulations for the LAN (issued in 1994) provide the procedural and&#13;
administrative details for the implementation of the law. Specific time periods for&#13;
administrative actions, and arbitration procedures to resolve conflicts are presented in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                     Annex A: Legal and Regulatory Framework, and Institutional Aspects&#13;
the Regulations. Because the Regulations were issued by means of a Presidential decree, they&#13;
can be more easily modified than the LAN, when required.&#13;
6.    The Federal Rights Law provide the legal framework and mechanisms for the Federal&#13;
Government to charge for the diversion and use of water, and for the discharge of water into&#13;
water bodies when the quality of the water discharged exceeds predefined parameters. The use&#13;
of water for agricultural production is exempted from these water charges. The Federal Tax&#13;
Law, the Law for Contribution for Improvements in Civil Works and the Federal Fiscal Code&#13;
complete the legal/fiscal framework for the regulation of water charges.&#13;
7.    The General Law for Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection establishes the&#13;
regulatory responsibilities of the Federal, State, and Municipal governments in the protection&#13;
of the environment and requires environmental assessments for actions that have&#13;
environmental impact.&#13;
8.    The International Boundary and Water Treaty between Mexico and the United States&#13;
of America defines the distribution and conservation of the water resources of the Colorado,&#13;
Rio Grande and Tijuana Rivers.&#13;
II. Institutional Aspects&#13;
Institutional Setting&#13;
9.    Mexican water resources policy is presented in the National Water Plan 1995-2000&#13;
(Programa Nacional Hidraulica 1995 - 2000 - PNH). PNH is oriented toward ensuring the&#13;
availability of water to satisfy the needs of the population and promote the development of&#13;
economic activities in a manner that is environmentally compatible and sustainable in each&#13;
region of the country. In accordance with this policy, avenues must be found for sustainable&#13;
development which requires establishing control and conditionalities on water usage such that&#13;
economic development is compatible with environmental protection. The importance that the&#13;
GOM bestows on the environment and on sustainable use of water resources is manifest in the&#13;
decision to relocate CNA from the old Agriculture and Water Resources Ministry to the newly&#13;
created environment ministry, SEMARNAP. This change has strengthened the authority and&#13;
responsibility that CNA has in the administration and management of water resources, because&#13;
it is no longer located within a Ministry responsible for one sector (agriculture) and therefore&#13;
permits an integrated management approach as established in the PNH and the LAN. CNA&#13;
has set a new agenda to modernize and decentralize the management of the nation's water&#13;
resources considering the needs of all uses in an environmentally sustainable manner. The&#13;
WRMP is the instrument that the GOM has designed to carry out this new agenda.&#13;
10.   CNA was created in 1989 to unite all aspects of water management. CNA has a&#13;
central office located in Mexico City and 6 regional offices, as follows: Northwest, in Ciudad&#13;
Obreg6n, Sonora; North, in Torre6n, Coahuila; Northeast, in San Luis Potosf, San Luis&#13;
Potosf; Southeast, in Merida, Yucatan; Lerma-Balsas, in Quer6taro, Quer6taro; and Valley of&#13;
Mexico, in Ciudad de Mexico, Distrito Federal. In addition, CNA has state offices located in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex A: Legal and Regulatory Framework, and Institutional Aspects                 3&#13;
each of the 31 state capitals and the Federal District. CNA has functioned in a centralized&#13;
way, but has recently adopted and is currently implementing a policy whereby: (a) the Central&#13;
Office functions will include oversight of water management activities and establishment of&#13;
overall policy, criteria and uniform guidelines and procedures; and (b) the Regional Offices&#13;
will have principle responsibility for water management, including: (i) the development of&#13;
river basin plans; (ii) the promotion and strengthening of basin councils; (iii) the coordination&#13;
of water resources planning and management activities both by public and private sector&#13;
participants; (iv) water quantity and quality monitoring activities; (v) reservoir operation;&#13;
(vi) the registry of water users into the National Public Water Rights Register; and (vii) dam&#13;
safety.&#13;
11.    At each level (central and regional) CNA has a similar organizational structure. The&#13;
Director General is responsible for managing the agency and reports directly to the Secretary&#13;
of SEMARNAP. There are six General Subdirectorates, five are technical and the sixth&#13;
(General Subdirectorate for Administration) handles administrative functions such as&#13;
personnel, equipment and supplies and contract administration. (See Chart A-1.) The 2 largest&#13;
technical General Subdirectorates are Construction and Operations, where presently the&#13;
majority of personnel and budget are allocated. The three General Subdirectorates in CNA that&#13;
would have direct responsibilities for the implementation of the Project are: (a) the Technical&#13;
General Subdirectorate (Subdirecci6n General T&amp;enica, SGT), responsible for aspects related&#13;
to meteorology (GSMN), surface water (GASIR), groundwater (GAS), water quality (GSCA)&#13;
and dam safety (CT); (b) the Planning General Subdirectorate (Subdirecci6n General de&#13;
Programaci6n, SGP), responsible for water resources planning and river basin council&#13;
establishment and strengthening; and (c) the Water Administration General Subdirectorate&#13;
(Subdirecci6n General de Administraci6n del Agua, SGAA), responsible for water rights&#13;
administration. Because these three departments encompass responsibilities for all aspects of&#13;
water resources management and their being located within one institution with clearly defined&#13;
legal responsibilities, CNA's organizational structure is very well suited to planning,&#13;
coordinating and implementing a comprehensive integrated water resource management&#13;
program. At the regional level the 6 functional areas are maintained in the organizational&#13;
structure under the direction of a regional manager who depends directly to the Director&#13;
General. (See Chart A-2)&#13;
12.    Presently the CNA Regional Office boundaries are along State lines. As stated in the&#13;
PNH, GOM has recently decided to reorganize CNA's regional dependencies into 13 regional&#13;
offices with their boundaries being located along river basin boundaries. This reorganization&#13;
will significantly facilitate the regional offices' abilities to carry out their water management&#13;
responsibilities in an integrated way, because river basins will be located totally within the&#13;
geographical limits of the Regional Offices. The new regional offices are shown on the&#13;
backpiece cover map and are the following: (a) Baja California Peninsula; (b) Upper&#13;
Northwest; (c) Lower Northwest; (d) Central Pacific; (e) Southern Pacific; (f) Northern&#13;
Border; (g) Northern Central Basins; (h) Lerma-Santiago; (i) Northern Gulf; (j) Central Gulf;&#13;
(k) Southern Gulf; (1) Yucatan Peninsula; and (m) Valley of Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                      Annex A: Legal and Regulatory Framework, and Institutional Aspects&#13;
13.   In accordance with the LAN, CNA is the national water authority with complete&#13;
responsibility for water rights administration, the management of the nations water resources and&#13;
dam safety. Other entities, including the Federal Electricity Commission (Comision Federal de&#13;
Electricidad - CFE), both public and private that operate reservoirs must do so under CNA&#13;
authorization and oversight. The Director General of CNA presides over a Technical Committee&#13;
for the Operation of Hydraulic Works. The committee makes overall decisions relative to the&#13;
operation of the nation's reservoirs (including the 64 hydropower dams operated by CFE) and&#13;
considerations related to floods, droughts, multiple uses (irrigation, municipal and industrial,&#13;
hydropower, navigation, recreation, etc.) and environmental protection. In addition to CNA&#13;
authorities and technical personnel, a CFE representative participates on the committee.&#13;
14.   The Mexican Institute for Water Technology (Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua,&#13;
IMTA) is responsible for water related research, technology evaluation and transfer, and for&#13;
training. It coordinates work being done at universities, research centers and other institutions in&#13;
Mexico and internationally, and has cooperative relationships with various water related entities&#13;
throughout the world. IMTA's participation in the area of training subcomponent as well as in&#13;
other aspects of the project will be important to its success.&#13;

WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX B: INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGICAL&#13;
SUPPORT, AND TRAINING&#13;
L Introduction&#13;
1.    Technology applied to the water sector in Mexico represents a gap when&#13;
compared to that utilized in developed countries. This fact makes of paramount&#13;
importance the development and introduction of new alternative technologies to:&#13;
(a) increase information and understanding about the nations water resources; (b) to&#13;
improve the planning and management of water resources; and (c) to improve the&#13;
operation of existing hydraulic infrastructure. This will require a permanent program of&#13;
education and training, transfer of technology and development of human resources aimed&#13;
at improving the CNA's capacity for integrated water management and sustainable&#13;
development.&#13;
IL Institutional Development&#13;
2.    The strategy proposed for the project component on Institutional Development,&#13;
Technological Support and Training, includes the following goals:&#13;
a) Support the decentralization of water resources management at the river basin&#13;
level;&#13;
b) Promote the establishment and strengthening of river basin councils;&#13;
c) Improve the technological resources and the professional skills of personnel&#13;
in central and regional offices;&#13;
d) Strengthen water rights administration and the collection of water fees;&#13;
e) Acquisition of training equipment and materials for improvement of central and&#13;
regional office training facilities;&#13;
f) Development of key international technological cooperation for water&#13;
resources management;&#13;
g) Intensive training programs in water resource management issues; and&#13;
h) Communication programs in the river basin councils.&#13;

Councils.&#13;
m. Technological Support&#13;
5.    The Water Resources Management Project will not include investment in new&#13;
infrastructure, but will be an instrument to assist CNA in modernizing its water&#13;
management activities and the operation of existing infrastructure. This will require&#13;
reliable, timely and updated information which will be acquired through upgrading&#13;
monitoring networks, and improving analytical capabilities to assist in water management&#13;
decision making. National and international technical assistance programs will be required&#13;
to provide technology transfer to the various offices of CNA and to the river basin&#13;
councils.&#13;
6.    The areas identified in which technological support will be required through&#13;
national and international assistance include: (a) the development of improved weather&#13;
forecasting methods to meet the increasing demand for specific meteorological products&#13;
inside CNA and outside for the diverse user sectors; (b) the establishment of 24 telemetric&#13;
hydrological networks in river basins affected by severe hydrometeorological events such&#13;
as floods, tropical storms, hurricanes, etc.; (c) the development of hydrological forecasting&#13;
systems for the prevention of floods and dam safety management and operation in&#13;
emergency situations in the main Mexican river basins; (d) the establishment of the&#13;
telecommunications and computer networks in all offices of CNA; (e) the updating of&#13;
procedure manuals for the safety of major dams in Mexico; (f) studies on water quality&#13;
monitoring, classification of national water bodies and on environment impact;&#13;
(g) modernization of the groundwater monitoring networks, including specific studies in&#13;
144 over exploited aquifers; (h) the necessary studies for an effective planning and&#13;
development of the water resources in Mexico; (i) the studies for integrated river basin&#13;
master plans and management; (j) the review and adaptation of modem technologies to be&#13;
applied to the registry and inscription of water users; and (k) the development of&#13;
information systems (including GIS) for the transmission, exchange and manipulation of&#13;
data inside and outside CNA.&#13;

WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX C: WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY MONITORING&#13;
IMPROVEMENTS AND ASSESSMENTS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I.    This annex discusses the WRMP activities related to improvements in the water quantity and&#13;
quality monitoring networks in Mexico. The annex is presented in a tabular format which provides&#13;
summary information on the activities of each of the subcomponents. For more detail the Project&#13;
Implementation Plan prepared by CNA should be referenced.&#13;
Table C-1: Meteorological Monitoring Network&#13;
Table C-2: Hydrometric, Climatological, Sediment and Reservoir Levels Monitoring Network&#13;
Table C-3: Groundwater Monitoring Network&#13;
Table C-4: Water Quality Monitoring Network and Laboratories&#13;
2.    In general terns, the monitoring systems presently in use present problems of (a) obsolete&#13;
equipment often in disrepair; (b) antiquated and inefficient procedures; (c) insufflicient personnel lacking&#13;
adequate training; (d) inadequate and underfunded operation and maintenance programs; (e)&#13;
insufficient and obsolete computer and telecommunications systems; and (f) diverse and inefficient data&#13;
validation, storage and retrieval programs.&#13;
3 .    The WRMP has the basic strategy of gradually moving towards the modernization of the&#13;
monitoring systems, learning from initial results and adjusting the programs along the way. Initial&#13;
activities and methodologies will be closely monitored and will be adapted and extended in&#13;
subsequent actions with as much flexibility as possible.&#13;
4.    The WRMP activities are designed to emphasize improving the use and operability of&#13;
existing data and networks prior to any network expansion. The project gives priority to the&#13;
following activities:&#13;
a) the design and installation (in a gradual manner) of computer and telecommunications&#13;
networks (hardware y software) at the state, regional and central levels of CNA to&#13;
permit: (i) the development and maintenance of interconnected data banks; (ii) the use&#13;
of modern computer programs for data manipulation and analysis; (iii) the easy&#13;
interchange of information, programs and files; and (iv) electronic communication&#13;
internal and external to CNA, including international&#13;
b) the rescue and digitalization of historic data and its introduction into well designed&#13;
interconnected data banks;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2          Annex C: Water Quantity and Quality Monitoring Improvements and Assessments&#13;
c) the design, upgrading and continuous maintenance of laboratories, monitoring&#13;
networks and information systems;&#13;
d) the establishment and implementation of procedures for the continuous maintenance&#13;
and updating of data banks; and&#13;
e) the training of personnel and institutional strengthening in modem methods of (i) data&#13;
collection, processing, storage and retrieval; (ii) analysis, modeling and forecasting;&#13;
and (iii) use of computer systems and tools such as GIS (see Annex F).&#13;
5.    These activities will bring large benefits for relatively low costs when compared to the&#13;
expansion of monitoring networks. As a second phase, the Project will include the design and&#13;
implementation of expanded monitoring networks based on the then improved knowledge of&#13;
problems and needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Table C-1&#13;
Implementation Plan for the Meteorological Monitoring Network Subcomponent&#13;
Background - Until the late 1 980s, the Mexican Meteorological Service was a classic service relying on analog instruments, manualy observed and with the data noted with pencil&#13;
and paper. Data was sent to Mexico City via voice telephone, high frequency radio or radio teletype.&#13;
In 1989, with the creation of the CNA and the inclusion of the GSMN into this organization, a major modernization effort was undertaken. This modernization effort was justified&#13;
under the LAN which mandated CNA to become a modern regulatory agency for the administration and control of water in a sustainable manner, to promote the participation of the&#13;
users, and to consolidate the necessary infrastructure for the study of climatologicaL hydrological and hydrometric phenomena, and the application of the knowledge obtained from&#13;
these studies&#13;
The modenization plan included the goals of having Mexico meet minimum data colection standards as recommended by the WMO in both surface and upper air observational station&#13;
densities, and almost complete Doppler radar coverage. The major thrusts of the modenization program were to convert to a fully automated and digitized data collection and&#13;
processing system, to increase the amount and quality of data collected, to have computers do the most processing possible and to increase both the quality and quantity of forecast&#13;
products utilizing a fuly modern digital communication system. This modernization program envisioned a major leap forward, bypassing a full technological generation. This change&#13;
in technology and way of performing the routine tasks in GSMN has put a strain on all resources, personnel, facilities and funding. For example, the requiremrent for field&#13;
meteorological observers and technicians was significantly reduced, while the requirement for highly trained and skiled computer engineers and meteorologists increased. The newv&#13;
technology also meant that any voice communication of data was far too slow. Automated observing systems with digital data transmission via satelite replaced many manual analog&#13;
systems throughout the country. In the Mexico City GSMN headquarters, computers were installed to receive and process this data. The existing 5 analog meteorological radars were&#13;
upgraded to digitized Doppler capable radars and another 7 new Doppler capable radars were installed. Eleven fully automated upper air sounding systems replaced some of the WWn &#13;
era upper air systems, leaving 5 of the original 10 old systems as part of the network. Some 650 automated Data Collection Platforms (DCP)s were installed throughout the country.&#13;
Only some 150 stations were operational in December 1995.&#13;
During the initial efforts of the modernization program, great and positive strides were taken as the result of imaginative and dedicated leadership in GSMN and CNA The&#13;
requirement for field meteorological observers and technicians was significantly reduced, while the requirement for highly trained and skiDed computer engineers and programmers&#13;
was increasing. The new technology also meant that any voice communication of data was far too slow. During the last 5 years GSMN has instaDled many new types of equipment, not&#13;
just simply by replacing existing equipment, but by replacing old technologies with new ones.&#13;
During the first phase of this modernization prgram, the following eqtuipment was instaled: (a) seven new digitized Doppler Radars; (b) five analog radars updated to Doppler&#13;
digitized radars; (c) six hundred automatic climatological stations (DCPs); (d) sixty five automatic synoptic stations; (e) eleven automated radiosonde stations, (f) one ground receiver&#13;
station for the automated climatological and synoptic stations; and (g) one meteorological satellite ground receiving station (GOES) with dedicated digital satellite telecommunicatinas&#13;
satelite channel.&#13;
The 1995 faltering of the Mexican economy right at the peak of this first modernization program contributed to the inability of accomplish some of the godas and to sever equipment&#13;
outages for long periods of time due to lack of funds for maintenance. Although much progress has been made, the GSMN is still unable to meet the ful requirements of the users, and&#13;
further actions are required to complete the total objectives.&#13;
The foDlowing problems remnin (a) maintenance, calibration and logistical support problems seriously reduce the data availability, (b) the problems with historical data retrieval,&#13;
digitizing and processing and the resulting lack of historical statistical data seriously hamper climatology, (c) lack of human resources, both in number and of necessary skils limit the&#13;
progress of the mnodanization efforts, and (d) the absence of information handling tools and equipment to integrate and process the available data also limit the development of the&#13;
service and its products.&#13;
Overall Objective - TBe objectives ofthis b aompurert a to support GSMN at the centrl and regional levels im (a) mrnxoving the coDlection, analysis, and synthesis data related to&#13;
atmospheric ph _m;mem   and (b) producing and providing meteorological and climatological infomation and forecasts to other parts of CNA, other agencies and to the general public.&#13;

Backgrund - Systematic hydlogical obsatins wr stared in Mexico in 1921, jointly wit rdated rainll climatological obsrans. Tnern*s, collectiy refto as                      o&#13;
hydroclimatological netwks, ae curretly undr CNA's GASIR (S*wcc Wates and Rive Engineing Group). GASIR has fou fimctcoal umits: Opeatal Hydrology, Hydrolgical&#13;
Analysis. Hydrorndry and Informatio Banks. Te Hydclimatological Service is decentralized through CNAs Regional and State Divisions; at each of'wich that are technical tnits. Besddes&#13;
GASR, sme sations we opnated by be Cmmion for Intfrnational Borders and Wates and the Fedeal Electicity Comamniion (CFE). he hydrocimatologicl netwuk is coadiated with&#13;
the newurk of CNA's National Wea  Serice (GSMN). A short number of real-time automated netwoks vue established begiming in 1985.&#13;
The climatological netwk peaked in 1989 with 3855 raingauges. Cmuntly that are 3281 raingauges, 88% of which depend on CNA, mowly (2926 stafions) though GASt At 90ffe oftbesc&#13;
stations thtre   also evaporation pans and only 7% (216) have ranfall recrders and 5% record relative humidity. Data from slightly ova 600 stations ae trnsmited daily. The hdrometric&#13;
(rivergauge) ndwkpeaked in 1980 with 1257 stations from where it declinedto 1055 stations curently. Ofthese, tawe ucmrendy 818 river gauges on natral watecom pa, ncticallyallR&#13;
of whichhave me than 1,000 kn2 of catdmh t area At 113 ofthese stations, suspended sediments we also observed, whilerecnds are kptfor 182 reseoirs. Ofthehydromtic (rimv&#13;
gauge) netwur, 222 transmit data daily through radio (100 units), telephone or fax GASIRs networks ae operated through 590 full-tn gauging technicians and 157 assistant gauging&#13;
tecniians, as vwll as 2,789 pait-me obseves who receive a snall indemnity for their war. According to WMO netwrk criteia (1994), the hydrmrtic nework is 57%/ deficint and 711&#13;
new stations would be needed to achieve ninimum  network density citeria. As for the clinatological (raingauge) netwod it is deficient by 41% and 2,000 new staions uld be needed to&#13;
achieve standard density.&#13;
to&#13;
The five telemetry netwrks that had bean established for reservoir management and flood waniing purposes have become dysfunctional because of cuts in the mntamenance budget Mainenae&#13;
was carried out under contract, and becase of lack of fuinds no maintenance contracts wer issued The impact of budget cuts on the conventional hydroclimatological netwk was less severe&#13;
because this network was maintained by individuals on the CNA payroll.&#13;
Hydroclimtological data are dispersed over one climatological and three hydrological data systems based on prnt and magnetic media Data adry is way behind schedule and thae is a nied to  I&#13;
establish sandards and secure convenient data access for users. Data need to be integratd with thoe collected by GSMN, with automated data netwks and with spatal data (radar, satdlite).  sO&#13;
Data quality control and feedback to field stations is insufficient A rating tank for current meters did exist but was closed in 1994. A new (circular) rating tank is currently under constructionL&#13;
GASIR staffnumbers nearly 100, of which45% are professional and technical, and 55% are general services staff. Inthe field, and thus not directly dependent of GASIR, that are 854 pronnelI&#13;
responsible for gauging stations as well as 1300 that work at the decentralized level (Regional and State).                                                                o&#13;
GASIRhas a portfolio of studies for various purposes with a large backlog Such studies concern subjects such as water balance and water availability for various purposes, flood contrl and&#13;
emergency management, and updating of infamation on river flow, sediment transport and reservoirs.&#13;
Lack of adequate hydrological infomiation is hampering water development in Mexico. Hydrological and climatological networks are way below acceptable standards and have deteriorated in dto&#13;
last ten years. The situation is particularly bad for the hydrmetdc netwod  (a) available technology is not being used; (b) real-time operations are severely constrained; and (c) thae is no&#13;
reasonably adequate flow of data for water pluming studies, for rver basin water balances and for water resource assesa ts. Consequnty use of technology for hydrological analysis is&#13;
severely constrained Dhe hydroclinatological netwok needs to be rehabilitated with new and proved technology, and than properly opatd and maintined New stations should be esablihshed&#13;
whae needed The radio cornmunications network at the basis of the system needs to be improved and stxugthened. Hstoric data need to be rescued, updated and stored in an adequate data&#13;
bank and the general backlog in processed data must be cleaned up. Real-time reservoir opeations and flood warning needs to be established in selected catchments. Some additional staffis&#13;
required and vast staff training needs must be tackled for the basic hydrological data sector in Mexico to reach a reasonable standard commiserate with existing ecanmic and demnogaphic&#13;
development&#13;
The dearth of adequate statistical and real-me data on water resources in Mexico, if allowed to continue, is bound to s4twrgle water planning and management within a context of inreasing &#13;
water scarcit in the larer part of Mexico.                                                                                                                                CD&#13;
Overall Objective - Dr objectives of this subcoponent are to support GASIR at the central and regional levels in: (a) impving the collection, analysis, and synthesis of data (water level&#13;
discdarge, rainfall, evaporation, sediment transport and reservoir monitoring) using appropriate technology within the context of a sustainable network and (b) improving analyses and  a&#13;
assessments of surface water resources to support decision making of other parts of CNA, other agencies and the general public.                                            cn&#13;

Background - Water supply in Mexico depends heavily on groumdwater resource. About one third of tota water consumptio (agricultaurl, urban, domnestic, and induistrial) comes from current&#13;
groundwater withdrawals. Groumdwater dependence is much higher in the urban/domestic sectors, which obtains more than 700/o of their water requrements fromthis source. About 55 millinn&#13;
people hving in the largest urban centers, and virtualy the entire rural population, depend on groumdwater for their water supply. Groundwater is also the sole water sce for most industrial&#13;
development in northern and central Mexico.&#13;
Agricultural irrigation, although relying more on surface water, is the main groumdwater user. There are areas in the northern, northwestern and central regions where irgated agriculture&#13;
depends almost entirely on groundwater exploitationL About 80,000 weUs, mostly privately owned, are being used to irrigate around 2 miDion ha of land, i.e., one third of the total irrigated land&#13;
in the country (6 million ha).&#13;
The natioial groimdwater balance is positive overall as extraction is only 70% of natural recharge. However, this positive balance conceals critical situation of overexploitation and poUution of&#13;
aquifes in many areas of the central and northern regions of the country. The National Water Master Plan of 1975 already underlined the overexploitation of 32 aqmufers. In 1981, this nmmber&#13;
increased to 36 aquifers. It is estimated that 80 of Mexico's 258 aquifers, located mainly in the northwestern, northern and central regiLons and in 16 states, are cintly being ovedrawd . Since&#13;
1981 the estimated overdraft volumes have almost doubled The consequences of aquifer overexploitation are aleady visible: accelerated dawdovwn of static water levels by as nmuh as 1.2&#13;
meters per year, fann weUs opeating with dynamic levels of 70 to 130 meters or more, with the coresponcding increased energy costs, salt water encroachment and soil saliniaicm in coastal&#13;
areas, and land subsidence in urban areas, with the damage this entails.&#13;
A less visible problenm, bat perhaps ultimately a cause for greater environmental concem, is the poUution of aquifers which are the source of population water supplies, by urban and industrial&#13;
effluent damped directly on top of these groundwater reservoirs. There being no operationarl system to monitor this probleni, there are no substantive data on how serious it is.&#13;
The important role of groundwater resources in sustaining the socio-economic development of Mexico on the one hand, and on the other, deficiencies in their management are gersating serious&#13;
problems of resources deterioration in quantity as weU as quality. Deficiencies in groundwater resource management include: (a) an inadequate monitoring system for resources maagement &#13;
quantity and quality, (b) quantitative studies supported by mathematical (computerized) models have not been carried out for numerous aquifers, (c) them is neither a grcmdwatcr data bank or&#13;
an information system to process groundwater related data to aid in assessments and modeling, and in decision maknrg; and (d) prospective approaches to grodwater resurces development and&#13;
protection me not supported by highly needed studies dealing with critical issues, such as: environmental costs of groundwater mirnig or overexploitatiLon, socoecomomic aspects of aquifer&#13;
stabilization programs, analysis of demand management for groundwater conservation, environmental impact of groundwater resource degradation by agricultural, indusrial and urban pollutants.&#13;
Geohydrological studies of the mnain aquifers of the country wer initiated in the 60s, with special emphasis on the arid and semi-eid areas of the northern and central regions whiere grundwatr&#13;
is the princpal water source. The majority of the sthdies used a regioala approach and preliminary quantitative assessment of resources. Ohers have the specific objective of analyzing&#13;
groundwater exploitationL Very few included mathematical modeling for aquifer management&#13;
There is an existing inventory of about 130,000 weUs with significant pumping capacity, 80,000 of wnich are for irrigation purpose and 15,000 for municipal and industrial supply. There are&#13;
many more wells that have not been inventoried. There is no systematic procedure for measurement of the actual well extractions. Groundwater withdrawal, mainly for irrigation which is the&#13;
major user sector, is estimated indirectly using data of energy consumption, and statistics of inigated area and crops.&#13;
There are piezometric data on about 210 aquifers. However the monitoring system only covers 144 aquifers, including: 70 overexploited aqtufers, 60 in fragile equilibrium and the remaining 14&#13;
which have important water resources stil underexploited. Monitoring operations have varied greatly, depending on budgetary resources. In 1990, 122 aquifers were monitored, bat in 1994, this&#13;
number had decreased to 68. Th groundwater qTality netwvrk, established in 1977, monitors only the quality of sources supplying a few important cities. Therefore it was not designed for, and&#13;
is not able to monitor groundwater quality degradation or aqtufer poUutian. During the last thirty years, a considerable amoimt of grmundwater data has been accumulated and preserved in various&#13;
formats which ae generaly not compatible for any processing or aquifer analysis.&#13;
Overall Objecdtve - The objective of the Grudwater Monitonng and Assessment sub-component of WRMP is to assess quantitatively and qualitatively and to monitor the 144 most important&#13;
aquifs of Mexico. The sb-component objective wilU be accomplished by cayin;g out the aquifer studies, the implementation of the monitoring network and the implementation of the&#13;
groundwater infoamation syst=m (SIAS).&#13;

Implementation Plan for the Water Quality Monitoring and Laboratory Subcomponent&#13;
Background - Water quality monitoring activities have been carmed out in Mexico since 1974. The current network of 803 stations is an inherited netwrk of srface aid groundwater stations&#13;
which has grown thrugh more than 20 years without a systematic basis. Although data are adequate to characteize surface wates according to conventional physical/chanical cnteria, the&#13;
netwvrk does not provide the type of data required for curent water quality management purposes. In the area of water quality monitoring, regional saffEng levels are more or less adequae for&#13;
field programs, however headquarters is very understaffed for the level of responsibility.&#13;
The laboratory network has gown to its present condition of (a) one national laboratory which is largely a shell since all rmajor equipment was relocate to IMTA in 1992, (b) six regional&#13;
laboratories of variable capabilities, anid (c) twenty seven state laboratories which are mainly concerned with very basic types of analysis. Several are exceptions with higher level capability.&#13;
-t&#13;
In theory, the lab network should have high, meditin and low level capabilities, however capabilities tend to depend on available insltrumentation rather than any rational allocation of analytical&#13;
responsibilities. At this time, there is little systematic quality control over data; CNA has no capability for organic chemistry, thee is a chronic sige of trained personel at all levels; mamy&#13;
nodern pieces of apparatus ame unused because of ladc of parts or lack of training.&#13;
The water quality information system csias of &amp;tee databases which are held separately. water quality, sewage treatment plants, rmunicipal and industrial effluents. The water quality&#13;
database is held in the RAISON platform which has adapted by IMTA for use by GSCA This platforn, developed by Envirment Canada, has given GSCA modem capabiLity for water data&#13;
management and assessment Maps however, are hed by region rate than by drainage basin The &amp;tre databases do riot canunicate with oarb other. Cnpauter equipment is in very shrt&#13;
supply and non-existent for water quality ppos  in rmost of the regional and stte offices. Training by IMTA for regioal staff has not been matched by conpAter acqiwsition, therefore all data&#13;
assenment is done at headquate.&#13;
The present status of water quality monitoring in Mexico reflects chronic budget prmblans for the water quality program since the mid 1980s winr much of the budget was reallocated to  0&#13;
oter parts of Seactanat ofAgriaulte amd Wat Rcso s (ww defunct) in the expectation hat the water quality program would be transfered to andw departme  This loss was never&#13;
recovered when the water quality prgram was recnfimnie m CNA in 1990.                                                                                                   .&#13;
Overall Objective - The objectives of this sulbcnponent me to support GSCA at the central and regional levels in: (a) improving the collection, analysis, and synthesis of water quality&#13;
data that meet specific mangment needs, are cost-effective, and repraent the types of modern environmmtal isss that now face Mexico (e.g. toxicity), (b) developing and arniding of&#13;
national (effluent) nonrs so tat tbese represent modern analytical and toxicity-based standards; and (c) producing and providing water quality studies, water body classifications and&#13;
assessments to other parts of CNA, other agencies and to the general public.&#13;
In-House vs. Contracting Laboratory Analys                                                                                                                              CD&#13;
The current (prt-WRMP) analytical volme for CNA is sane 500,000 analyses annually. The majority are inexpensive basic analyss. Uinder the WRMP, and ineluding disge mmmilming&#13;
and analysis (not preseitly done), the analycl volunme will reman at swbat less han 500,000 analyse per year. The prinpl difference is ta there will be a major reduction m basic&#13;
analysis with a on     ate i   mase in high-level analysis (e.g. oganic cenpowids) which cost an rder of magi   r  thm basic analyses. 2lbe nimber of high-level analys will be&#13;
kept down throg exsive use of less expcensve toaicity asssents, which ae presently rot used.&#13;
A cost conparison was made betwn  the opion of coating out lboaoy analyse vs. doing &amp;em  in-house. The conris  showed that even with a significant discamt (50%) on the&#13;
prsent going rate, the cost of cmtacing out vmuld sdll be about 4 times gmrater than  e cost of performing the analyses m CNA laboratories. Od  factors that mfluhrced the decision for in-&#13;
hwse analyses were: (a) limited eising capability in private labs, virtually nrexistent in much of the eountry, and (b) the time-limited nture of many of the analyses retict the ability to&#13;
perve and ship samples.&#13;

WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX D: RESERVOIR OPERATION, DAM SAFETY, AND&#13;
AQUIFER MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    This annex discusses the WRMP activities related to improvements in reservoir&#13;
operation, dam safety and aquifer management in Mexico. The annex is presented in Tabular&#13;
format which provides summary inforrnation on the activities of each of the subcomponents.&#13;
For more detail the Project Implementation Plan prepared by CNA should be referenced.&#13;
Table D-1: Reservoir Operation&#13;
Table D-2: Dam Safety&#13;
Table D-3: Aquifer Management&#13;
2.    In general terms, these activities presently have the following problems: (a) antiquated&#13;
and inefficient models and procedures; (b) insufficient personnel lacking adequate training; and&#13;
(c) insufficient and obsolete computer and telecommunications systems.&#13;
3.    The WRMP has the basic strategy of gradually moving towards improvements in&#13;
reservoir operation, dam safety and aquifer management, learning from initial results and&#13;
adjusting the programs along the way. Initial activities and methodologies will be closely&#13;
monitored and will be adapted and extended in subsequent actions with as much flexibility&#13;
as possible.&#13;
4.    The WRMP activities discussed in this annex are focused on improving criteria and&#13;
procedures in order to achieve: (a) efficient, modem and effective reservoir operation with&#13;
the objective of maximizing the benefits derived from the existing hydraulic infrastructure;&#13;
(b) safety of dams in order to assure their continued operation and to avoid damages and&#13;
catastrophes; and (c) the effective management of aquifers in order to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of their use.&#13;
&#13;

Implementation Plan for the Reservoir Operation Improvement Subcomponent&#13;
Background - Dams for water storage were built in Mexico since the colonial times. The water storage sector started to develop strongly in 1926, when the National&#13;
Commission for Irrigation was created. Initially, the focus of reservoir development was on storage and some very large dams were constructed. With time, flood control&#13;
became more important in the context of a more comprehensive policy. The problem of floods and droughts has been addressed since 1972, with attention paid to normal&#13;
(medium and long range) operation of reservoirs and management of emergency situations. A large number of emergencies have been managed since then. The activity met&#13;
with many constraints, induding lack of timely and reliable information, lack of adequate data transmission and storage systems, as well as lack of hydrological forecasting&#13;
technology.&#13;
Two models, OPTIMA and HOWARD, are being used for medium and long range reservoir operation. Simpler methods, such as monthly forecasting equations and probability&#13;
curves for reservoir inflows, are also applied. There is a large need for calibration and validation of models and procedures. Development of such procedures meets the&#13;
constraints of lack of computer infrastructure, scant data and limited availability of qualified staff.&#13;
For flood forecasting, the GASIR rainfall-runoff model is used. Once the flood forecast is obtained, the flood is routed through the reservoir being studied and the downstream&#13;
channel. A reservoir operation plan is developed on the basis of the information computed in this way.&#13;
The current situation is thus characterized through inefficient antiquated technology, insufficient information to feed the models and an insufficient communication infrastructure  i&#13;
to monitor the events and to relay action requirements to the field sites.                                                                                 c;&#13;
Adequate reservoir operation and emergency management in Mexico, either in the case of floods or droughts, is hampered because of a dearth of hydrometric, climatological  c&#13;
and meteorological data, owing to the insufficient density and quality level of networks and their degradation since roughly 1985. During critical situations, there are not enough&#13;
rainfall data available and there are extremely few rainfall intensity reports. Most of the reservoir management information is obtained by voice radio, fax and telephone. The&#13;
radio communications network, which has proved particularly valuable in the past, is not only obsolete but increasingly beyond its expected useful life and has depended on&#13;
makeshift repairs. Field staff, while generally very willing to carry out its work, is almost totally without technical training to face emergency tasks.&#13;
Automatic telemetry systems, which were established in a few critical catchments, collapsed because of lack of maintenance owing to unavailability of funds for maintenance&#13;
contracts.&#13;
For long range forecasts and annual reservoir management, the existing OPTIMA model used since 1986 has been reasonably successful as far as the recommendations&#13;
issued were implemented. Historic information, both on the water supply and the water demand side, has been insufficient or not available in time, resufting in impaired  &gt;&#13;
recommendations. Overall, the decision-making process is cast in empirical and subjective approaches. Information of economic aspects of water management is particularly  n&#13;
scant. The models used for management of emergency situations have evolved little in the last 20 years and there is a large need for updating to take advantage of new  Gh&#13;
technology in this field.&#13;
In accordance with the National Water Law, CNA is the national water authority with complete responsibility for water rights administration, the management of the  I&#13;
nations water resources and dam safety. Other entities (including CFE) both public and private that operate reservoirs must do so with CNA authorization and&#13;
oversight. CFE operates 64 dams with hydroelectric plants. The Director General of CNA presides over a Technical Committee for the Operation of Hydraulic&#13;
Works. In addition to CNA authorities and technical personnel, a CFE representative participates on the committee. The committee makes overall decisions relative  I&#13;
to the operation of the nation's reservoirs including considerations related to floods, droughts, multiple uses (irrigation, municipal and industrial, hydropower,&#13;
navigation, recreation, etc.) and environmental protection. During emergency situations the committee often acts directly in making decisions for reservoir&#13;
operations. As the meteorological, hydrological, water quality, groundwater, dam safety, water rights administration and water resources planning and management&#13;
services of CNA improve with the WRMP, the availability and reliability of information and the decision making of the committee will also improve, resulting in better&#13;
operation of CNA and CFE reservoirs as well as others. As a part of its decentralization actions, CNA is in the process of transferring some of its dams to state  i&#13;
governments and to CFE (in the case of CFE, those dams that have hydropower plants). However, CNA will always retain the authority to administer water rights,&#13;
manage water resources and for dam safety, and will continue to oversee improvements in reservoir operation through the committee.&#13;
Overall Objective - The objectives of this subcomponent are to support the activities of GASIR in improving reservoir operation to maximize the benefits derived from the&#13;
operation of existing hydraulic infrastructure by increasing water availability and reducing the adverse consequences of floods and droughts. See CHART D-1 for diagram of&#13;
forecasting system.&#13;

Implementation Plan for Improvements in Dam Safety Subcomponent&#13;
Background - It is estimated that there are over 4,000 dams in Mexico. Due to size, location, age, inadequate desigr, poor cosructim or lack of mainlara     a signific-nt propetikm&#13;
of thse dams may pose a risk to human life, propety, agnculture ard industry downsream&#13;
CNA and in pcula CT have considerable expence  in addressing dam safety pblmrns in individual dams of the varous types built in Mexco dunrig several decades ver,&#13;
curcntly thee is no omrpreh sive, systematic and effective national dam safely pimgr  in Mexico. Under WRMP the CNA plans to imlement the first phase of a suslainable&#13;
national dan safety prgrL  This progran, in conjunction with a second phase (not palt of WRMP) whudi will include rndial d   will result in lorg-term befits by saving lives,&#13;
proteing property and cops, and enhacing overall water managenent in the cowmtry.&#13;
Responsibility for dam safety in CNA lies with CT of the SGT.&#13;
A National Registty of [wms (Registry) was started m 1989 but is currently on hold due to lack of funding. The present Regishy includes 3,200 dams with storage capacity greater than&#13;
0.5 million m3; for rnio of thmT, information o their safety conditions is very limited Out of the dams registered, about 18%/ can be classified as large (&gt;1 5m) and approxo,dely 200/o&#13;
are older than 30 yars Only about 15% of the registered dams have been inspected; deficiendies of various kinds and degrees 'Aer identified in about 50ffe of them. This high rate of  co&#13;
deficienies along with the number of large dams, their age and lack of inspections, are indicative of potentially high safety riskl&#13;
Although Owen is an ongoing program to inspect and correct deficiendes at the most critical dams, ther are not enough trained personnel within CNA to keep up with neoded&#13;
inspections. FurthemTore there are no standardized dam safety guidelines.&#13;
An apprecable number of dams constructed over the past 30 years have been instrumented, Howvever, many of these perfomnance monitoring instmnents have been damaged or&#13;
deshtoyed. At present remaining instuunents are only being read at a few dams and data collected from instrument readings is only sporadically analyzed. One important component of a&#13;
thorough dam safety prnpamn, is the systematic updating (every five years or so for large dams) of the hydrology of the catchment areas of the dams. The main purpose of this exercise is&#13;
to be able to route through the reseroir the updated madximu  estimated flood and verify the sufficiency of the spillway and oher outlet works to handle it, without the dam being&#13;
overtopped (which in an embankment dam might lead to breaching). Systematic updating of the probable rnwaimiun flood allows for (if necessary) making corrections to the dam and its&#13;
appurtenant structies, thus minimizing the subsequent risk of the dam being overtopped. Accordingly, systematic updating at suitable intervals of the hydrmlogy of selced dams is  in&#13;
included nthis isubcomponi&#13;
Operation and maintenance manuals do not exist for most dams, and maintenance of existing structures is a problem thxmglout the coumnry due to lack of finding  Likewise risk&#13;
ma_gent guidelines related to dams and energency action plans for high risk rsvirs are non exstent&#13;
Overall Objectlve - The objectives of this subconronent are to support CT in the imnplenmetation of the first phase of a national damn safety progam, preparation of amgency action j  I&#13;
plans and development of risk management guidelines. &#13;

Implementation Plan for the Aquifer Management Improvement Subcomponent&#13;
Background - Background information on Mexico's overexploitod aquifers problems is summarized in Annex C, Table C-3.&#13;
In many instances, in the past 20 to 30 years, the overexploitation or mining of aquifers has made possible the continuing development of agriculture, urban growth, and the expansion of industry.&#13;
However, aquifer depletion has produced serious environment degradation problems and severely limited prospects for continued growtLh The general impact has been the increasing pumping&#13;
depths and energy costs, saline intrusion in coastal aquifers, land salinization, and severe groundwater pollution by urban and industrial effluents.&#13;
The time has come to design a consistent and coherent strategy for optinal use of groundwater resources that addresses among other issues the urgent need for stabilization, restoration and&#13;
conservation of aquifers as weU as environment protection.                                                                                                              I&#13;
Most initiatives to date to remedy the critical problem of overpumped aquifers - no matter how solid their technical grounding or legal backing - have met with limited success or have failed  e&#13;
outright hi a recent shift in approach, CNA has organized an intensive campaign to consult and negotiate with groundwater users. They are being invited to become actively involved in aquifer&#13;
management and in monitoring compliance with regulations that are being worked out directly with users.                                                                  f&#13;
Such arrangements with users would appear to be the most pronusing approach, from a socioeconomic standpoint in efforts to stabilize and restore overpumped aquifers. Because irrigation&#13;
accounts for 70%/o to 80% of the total demand for groundwater, efforts to curtail overpumping should be concentrated in irrigation areas. It would be unrealistic to expect farmers to accept a lower&#13;
standard of living or drastically raise yields to compensate for pumping restrictions. Regulations should be phased in, and should include economic inducements to grow high-yield aops that&#13;
consume less water and encourage the use of more modem irrigation techniques that save water and cut down on pumping costs.                                             C&#13;

Overall Objective -   The objective of the Aquifer Management Improvement subcoinponent is to acquire a prospective vision on citical issues of aquifers management and groundwater  p&#13;
protection, and to develop management tools in view to supporting the decision making process.&#13;

General Description of WRMP Activities - The managemrent issues, related to technucal as well as socioeconomuc aspects, are especially related to overexploited aquifers and those&#13;
undlergouig various degrees of degradation by point-source or non-point-source pollution. Optimrization models need to be developed as management tools in decision making with explhcit&#13;
consideration of respective costs and benefits of alternative action progrms. They models would serve as the basis of discussion and consensus building in the firmework ofdecentralized water  X&#13;

deternined by the Plan                                                                                                                                           O&#13;
b)  Study of groundwater withdrawaL In absence of direct measurement, the study will carry out an evaluation of groundwater extraction by different indirect methods which will  r&#13;
be cross-checked. These will include the pumping energy consumption, data from the water user registry, satellite imagery for irrigated area evaluation and other statistics data.  0&#13;
c)  Study of non point source pollution of groundwater. While there are 2 million hectares of land irrigated by groundwater, there is practically no substantial information and data&#13;
on groundwater pollution related to agricultural activities, especially in relation to nitrate concentration. As the same source of groundwater constitutes the principal water supply&#13;
source of numerouis muniticipalities and of almost all the ural population, there is an urgent need to assess the agricultural pollution level of aquifers, at the national and regional&#13;
scale. Based on its findings, tie study will propose concrete measures to protect and restore the groundwater quality.                                           C&#13;
d)  Study of point source pollution control. The analysis will consist of eight case studies in selected areas where point source pollution has been detected. Based on its findings,&#13;
the study will propose prevention measures for similar sitmations. &#13;
e) Environmental costs of groundwater overexploitatomn. The analysis will concern ten cases of overexploitation, using the Marginal Oppotunity Costs (MOC) approachL The&#13;
econometric model of environmental accounting developed by INEGI will be used for aggregation at the national level.&#13;
f)  Water demand management for aquifer stabilization and restorationL Six cases will be selected for analysis and proposal for actions. The proposed actions would analyze all&#13;
aspects related to water demand management: technical, socioeconomic, financial, water ight transfer, intra and intersectoral reallocation.&#13;
g)  Synthesis of geohydrological units. Groundwater resources management in Mexico is still curTently based on the geohydrological concept of aquifer, the number of which is&#13;
estimated at 459. In the framework of a comprehensive approach of vater resources management that recognizes the interactions among various elements of the river basin's&#13;
ecosystem, it is necessary to synthesize the geohydrological units into more manageable aquifer systems (according to the systenmc appmach).&#13;
0&#13;
Aquifer Management Modeling - During the second phase of the project (I 998-2001), and according to the river basin councils request, optimization models of aquifer management vwll be&#13;
camed out The models objective would be to provide councils members the technical, socioeconomic, financial and envirornental implications of altemative action progams concernirng aquifer  3&#13;
management and especially aquifer stabilizaton and restoration. Inputs for optimization models will be provided by the geohydrological simulation models (see Aquifer assessment sub-&#13;
component in Annex C) and the results of the prospective studies.&#13;
Training - The training effort in aquifer management will aim to develop and expand the professional skills and capacities of technical staffofCNA central and regional offices and of water&#13;
basin councils. The training program in various technical and managenal aspects ofgroundwater resources conservation and pollution control will comprise: seminars, wrkshops, study tours&#13;
oflred by tisttutions abroad, and intentional master programs.&#13;

WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX E: WATER RIGHTS ADMINISTRATION&#13;
L Background&#13;
I.    Past and current issues in Mexico's water resources management associated with water&#13;
policies can be assessed within a concept of efficiency that includes the effectiveness of the legal and&#13;
institutional framework, particularly that of water rights administration. See Annex A for a&#13;
discussion of the legal and regulatory framework related to water use and development in Mexico.&#13;
2.    The National Water Commission (CNA), created in 1989, is the sole federal authority&#13;
empowered to manage the national waters. Since 1995, CNA has been relocated from the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources to the new Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources&#13;
and Fisheries. This relocation recognizes water as a basic resource for all economic sectors.&#13;
Formerly, it was difficult to separate CNA's role as Authority from its role as promoter of irrigation&#13;
development. The confusion caused by the fact of being "judge and party" created some&#13;
distortions.&#13;
]L Present Situation&#13;
3.    In relation to water rights administration, CNA's immediate objective is to regulate water&#13;
use and discharge in order to preserve the resource's quantity and quality for a sustainable use and&#13;
development. The water use concession and discharge permit with payment of the corresponding&#13;
fees is administrated by the Water Administration General Subdirectorate (SGAA) within CNA.&#13;
SGAA has the following administrative units:&#13;
4.    Services to Users. This unit operates in all states and is in charge of evaluating the&#13;
applications, issuing the corresponding concessions and permits, and promoting legal registration of&#13;
water rights.&#13;
5.    The National Public Water Rights Register is responsible of registering water right titles and&#13;
their modification, including all transactions of water rights, as well as certfying water rights and&#13;
safeguarding all registered titles and their supporting documents.&#13;
6.    The Collection and Control Service is in charge of registering users fiscal statements and the&#13;
corresponding payment of fees. It must also provide the necessary information to the Fiscal Affairs&#13;
Unit to determine and communicate fiscal charges to users who do not pay. If the omission of&#13;
payment persists, the case is turned to the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit to proceed&#13;
accordingly. This service must also ensure that the users comply with the conditions and datelines&#13;
established in their concessions or permits. Inspection and control visits are carried out to verify the&#13;
veracity of water abstraction volumes as well as volumes and quality of wastewater reported by&#13;
users.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                  Annex E: Water Rigbts  I inis-Iatica&#13;
7.    The Evaluation and Development Unit has the responsibility of supporting the devdpnent&#13;
of information systems required for the numerous and complex tasks of the other thee wvics. It&#13;
must also integrate, update and distribute formats and procedures, and coordinate training&#13;
programs.&#13;
A. Registration of Concessions and Permits&#13;
8.    When the National Water Law (LAN) was promulgated in December 1992, there wee&#13;
three types of water users:&#13;
a) regular users, who used national water and its associated land resources and dicged&#13;
wastewater within the terms of concessions and permits or of some other typs of&#13;
authorization issued by appropriate authorities according to the previous legisation;&#13;
b) irregular users, who had some ldnd of authorization but did not comply with all its terms&#13;
such as the granted volume of abstrction; and&#13;
c) clandestine users, who had no authorization at all.&#13;
9.    The Regulations for the LAN, issued in January 1994, have given water users, and&#13;
iischargers certain incentives to register their water rights in accordance with the new LAN.&#13;
During that year the Comnission gave priority to the registration of large volume users and&#13;
polluters. About 80%Yo of the volume of water used is now under legal registration, although only&#13;
37,600 users, out of an estimated universe of 300,000, have been regularized. About 5,000&#13;
wastewater discharges have also been regularized.&#13;
10.   The registration process presently has the following difflicuies:&#13;
a) the procedures to entitle new users and to regulaize the others are complex and slow in&#13;
processing;&#13;
b) irregular users are not willing to regularize their situation due to the fines to be paid;&#13;
c) users often do not have some of the documents required by law,&#13;
d) in most cases, users apply for larger volumes of water than CNA is willing to grant;&#13;
e) low income users, mostly from the irrigation sector, express that they can neithe pay&#13;
the fines nor even the charges of issuing the title and permit; and&#13;
f) users registered uuilaterally by the Conunission do not pick up thir fitles becase they&#13;
are not willing to pay the fines and registration fees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E: Water Rights Administration                                                3&#13;
11.   In September 1995 three presidential decrees were issued to help alleviate some of these&#13;
problems. Under these decrees, one-year amnesty periods have been granted during which water&#13;
users and dischargers can register without having to pay fines, and in the case of agricultural users,&#13;
without have to pay registration fees.&#13;
B. Legal Certainty of Water Rights: the Public Water Rights Register&#13;
12.   The LAN establishes that the titles, as well as their modifications and transactions, must be&#13;
listed in the National Public Water Rights Register (REPDA). The objective is to ensure legal&#13;
certainty of water rights and facilitate their modification and transfer, thus fostering the existence of&#13;
a market of water rights.&#13;
13.   At present, out of the 43,700 regularized users, 37,600 are registered in the official books.&#13;
Some users are not willing to register their titles due to the cost of the process and perhaps they are&#13;
not aware of the fundamental advantage of being registered in REPDA (only the rights inscribed in&#13;
REPDA can be sold or transferred). Some users have expressed their disagreement with the data&#13;
that must be registered.&#13;
14.   These problems, as well as those concerning the users' regularization process, have inhibited&#13;
the expansion of the water rights market, although widespread trading of water rights has already&#13;
taken place in and zones.&#13;
C. Fees Collection&#13;
15.   Important results have been achieved regarding the collection of water use fees, though&#13;
several problems prevail. Collections have increased from less than 200 million nuevos pesos in&#13;
1989 to almost 1,500 million nuevos pesos in 1994 (wastewater discharge fees amounted to only 50&#13;
million nuevos pesos the same year). Potential fee collection would be much higher than what is&#13;
actually collected as CNA relies on the users' will to regularize their legal status with the&#13;
corresponding fee payment. This strategy requires extensive field inspection and control and&#13;
subsequent law enforcement procedure. Other problems making fee collection more difficult&#13;
include:&#13;
a) most users do not have any measurement device for both abstraction and discharge;&#13;
b) municipal water utilities and various major users, such as sugar mills, have not paid their&#13;
abstraction and discharge fees arguing their economic difficulties; and&#13;
c) the population of potential contributors is not clearly identified.&#13;
ILL WRMP&#13;
16.   The objectives of the Water Rights Administration component are to consolidate the&#13;
enforcement of the LAN, to strengthen the new federalism by securing water rights to all legal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                    Annex E: Water Rights Administraion&#13;
water users, to facilitate transaction of water rights, and to improve water fees collection.&#13;
Additionally, this component has the objective of providing a basis and a means for the allocation of&#13;
water towards more productive uses (i.e. improving the economic efficiency of water use) in a&#13;
dynamic setting where water demands are continually changing, while simultaneously protecting&#13;
against aquifer depletion, protecting the water rights of third parties, and reducing water pollution.&#13;
This is to be done by supporting the effective functioning of water markets that have developed&#13;
following the promulgation of the LAN.&#13;
17.   Although the government has made good progress in identifying and registering of current&#13;
water users and discharges since the 1992 publication of the LAN and its 1994 regulations, there&#13;
are still many issues related to the administration of water rights that need to be tackled to ensure&#13;
that the water market achieves its desired objectives. Some of these include facilitating the&#13;
registration of existing water users, implementing a modified fee schedule for extracting and&#13;
discharging water, training CNA staff so that so that they can better protect against aquifer&#13;
depletion and possible negative third-party effects, and volumetric pricing.&#13;
18. These objectives will be accomplished by carrying out the following sub-components.&#13;
A. Services to Users&#13;
19.   This sub-component will include the tasks of identifying the population of users and of&#13;
improving the service to users for the title registration.&#13;
20.   Users identification. This task will be carried out in three stages:&#13;
a) general characterization of the user population: using available statistics from various&#13;
sources, this activity will aim at identifying the principal categories of users according to&#13;
the volumes abstracted and the discharges, their location in relation to municipalities,&#13;
states and water basins;&#13;
b) cross-checking of the previous information with users listed in REPDA and in the data&#13;
base of Fee Collection Service; and&#13;
c) users identification with specific targeting (areas of water scarcity, potential payers of&#13;
water use and discharge fees, areas with water quality degradation, small users with&#13;
water rights to be protected).&#13;
21.   Improvement of Services to Users by:&#13;
a) the implementation of single counter service;&#13;
b) the implementation of computer systems to speed up the administrative procedures of&#13;
title registration,&#13;
c) the realization of field visits to regularize clandestine users.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E: Water Rights Administration                                              5&#13;
22.   All these tasks will be carried out by contracts with consulting firms.&#13;
B. REPDA&#13;
23.   This sub-component will include the modernization of the operating system of REPDA,&#13;
updating the computer system and digitizing of documents, and the data processing capacity for&#13;
public communication and publication. These tasks will be carried out by contracts with consulting&#13;
firms.&#13;
C. Fee Collection and Control&#13;
24.   This sub-component will include:&#13;
a) The technology development for measurement of water use and wastewater discharge&#13;
including: a survey for identification of large users and polluters, a study of norms,&#13;
standards and regulations for fair determination of water use fees and discharge fees,&#13;
and a pilot scheme for experimentation of new measurement equipment;&#13;
b) An accelerated program of inspection and control visits. This program will carry out a&#13;
total of 60,800 visits over 6 years.&#13;
D. Computing Resources Development&#13;
25.   Computer resources to be developed for support of the three previous sub-components will&#13;
include:&#13;
a) the design and implementation of an integrated information system for all areas of water&#13;
rights administration and the networking with other services of CNA; and&#13;
b) complete renovation of the obsolete existing computer equipment (20 XT-PCs, 77 AT-&#13;
PCs and 14 386-PCs) as well as its expansion.&#13;
E. Training&#13;
26.   The training effort in water rights administration will aim to develop and expand the&#13;
professional skills and capacities of technical staff of CNA central and regional offices and of water&#13;
basin councils mainly in two areas:&#13;
a) data bases exploitation; and&#13;
b) measurement and control of water abstraction and wastewater discharge.&#13;

WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX F: WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS&#13;
I. Water Resources Planning and River Basin Councils&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.    By the early seventies, the Ministry of Water Resources of Mexico had accumulated a great&#13;
deal of information and experience in developing the country's water resources. Additionally,&#13;
professional groups and institutions related to water planning and management shared the vision of&#13;
a integrated national water policy which would support economic growth and social development&#13;
while seeking solutions to the increasing problems of water scarcity, depletion of water sources and&#13;
water pollution.&#13;
2.    In 1975, the first National Water Plan was completed, providing a framework to improve&#13;
water resources management consistent with national and regional objectives. In 1976, the National&#13;
Water Plan Commission was created to implement the 1975 Plan and update it on a systematic&#13;
basis. Also in 1976, the Ministries of Water Resources and Agriculture were transformed into the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources. This change caused some disruption in the water&#13;
planning and management efforts. In response to growing institutional problems and to the need of&#13;
reinforcing water policies and strategies directed to developing and operating hydraulic&#13;
infsucture and improving water use efficiency and pollution controL the National Water&#13;
Commission (CNA) was created in 1989 as the sole federal authority dealing with water resources&#13;
management.&#13;
3.    In 1990, the necessary studies were undertaken to design a new legal instrument. The&#13;
resulting National Water Law (Ley de Aguas Nacionales - LAN), enacted in December of 1992,&#13;
provides a modem legal framework for water resources management.&#13;
4.    An overall assessment of the 1975 National Water Plan was made by the World Bank,&#13;
stating: "...comparisons with similar efforts in other countries show that the 1975 National Water&#13;
Plan is at least as good, but probably better than what was achieved elsewhere. The only major&#13;
effort of this type to date was carried out in 1968-73 in the United States, culmiating in a report&#13;
entitled Water Policies for the Future...". The National Water Plan was updated in 1981 and 1994.&#13;
During this time the emphasis has shifted from water resources development to conservation and&#13;
sustainable use.&#13;
B. Present Situation&#13;
5.    By the end of the last decade, many water problems had worsened. Scarcity situation were&#13;
present in almost two thirds of the territory with the consequent increase in the overexploitation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                              Annex F: Water Resources Planning and Information Systems&#13;
aquifers; water use efficiency had dropped and water quality had deteriorated. In response to this&#13;
situation, and at the beginning of the present decade, new water policies were defined and oriented&#13;
in three main directions: development of the infrastructure needed to eliminate existing gaps and&#13;
meet increasing demands; achieving greater water use efficiency; and water pollution abatement and&#13;
control.&#13;
6.    Since 1995, under the new Administration, CNA has been relocated within the new&#13;
Ministry of the Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries both to reinforce the notion of water&#13;
as a natural resource to be managed in a sustainable way and to reinforce the country's decision to&#13;
abate and control water pollution. The new water policy stresses:&#13;
a) integrated water plarning and management both in quantity and quality;&#13;
b) decentralization and greater participation of users and society as a whole;&#13;
c) introduction of market mechanisms, pricing and other economic incentives to induce&#13;
efficient use of water.&#13;
7.    The LAN provides a modem legal framework for water resources management. It states&#13;
explicitly that sustainable development is its primary objective. Furthermore, the Law is consistent&#13;
with CNA's embryonic efforts related to decentralization, water users participation, efficient use of&#13;
water, economic instruments and the role of the private sector.&#13;
8.    The organized participation of water users and stakeholders is foreseen by the Law as a&#13;
mandatory prerequisite for water planning, as well as the formulation of specific management rules&#13;
to regulate water use in the framework of the water management unit which is the river basin. The&#13;
river basin councils will be the forum where Federal, State and Municipal govemments, the water&#13;
users and stakeholders can share the responsibility of planning and managing the basin's water&#13;
resources.&#13;
9.    The establishment of the Lerma-Chapala River Basin Council has been exemplar in building&#13;
consensus for the management of common water resources. Through the Council, water allocation&#13;
policies were negotiated in 1992 between the five State Govemments involved with the specific&#13;
objective of maintaining adequate water levels and improving the water quality in Lake Chapala, the&#13;
countrys largest water body. An investment program was also launched to clean the Lerma River&#13;
waters through the construction of 48 treatment plants. As a result the pollutant charge into Lake&#13;
Chapala has been reduced by 65%. Participation in the Council's activities has been outstanding.&#13;
Water users (irrigation, municipal, industrial, recreation), state governments, federal entities in&#13;
addition to CNA-&#13;
10.   Drawing from this experience, the Rio Bravo River Basin Council was established in 1994&#13;
and has proceeded to implement water allocation policies as well as wastewater treatment programs&#13;
to clean the river waters in compliance with Mexico-USA agreements. The establishment of the&#13;
Valle de Mexico River Basin Council, in August 1995, has been another important step forward in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F: Water Resources Planning and Information Systems                        3&#13;
the decentralization policy as the basin contains the greatest metropolitan area in the world with its&#13;
enormous problem of water supply, sanitation and drainage.&#13;
C. WRMP&#13;
Objectives&#13;
11.   The central objective of the subcomponent of Water Resources Planning and River Basin&#13;
Council Support is to strengthen and decentralization of water resources management and planning&#13;
at the hydrographic region level with the participation of water users and other stakeholders.&#13;
12.   The planning task will consist of preparing water resources management strategy which is a&#13;
set of medium and long-term action programs to accomplish the country's development objectives&#13;
and to implement its water policies. Critical issues in water policies formulation in relation to long-&#13;
term development objectives that water resources management strategy must address include:&#13;
a) restoration and protection of surface and groundwater quality, over exploited aquifers,&#13;
surface water bodies and aquatic and riparian ecosystems to promote the health of all&#13;
citizens including the poor, supported by the strategic decentralization of water&#13;
resources management with participation of water users and other stakeholders in&#13;
decision making;&#13;
b) reliance on the private sector, water user associations, water users and other&#13;
stakeholders;&#13;
c) rural infrastructure development mainly in the water supply and sanitation sector to&#13;
reduce urban migration which would require technological innovation to develop&#13;
affordable systems in small settlements;&#13;
d) increase financial resources with the participation of the private sector in water supply&#13;
and sanitation systems;&#13;
e) transferring of responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of irrigation systems to&#13;
water user associations;&#13;
f) improving water use efficiencies in irrigation delivery systems, on-farm and in water&#13;
supply systems;&#13;
g) improving the allocation of water between sectors; and&#13;
h) support for the govenment program (National Development Plan) to develop 100&#13;
urban centers to take pressure off the Mexico City Megalopolis.&#13;
13 Strategy formulation will incorporate the elements of comprehensive water resources&#13;
planning and management, including: (a) institutional and human resources; (b) development of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                               Annex F: Water Resources Planning and Information Systems&#13;
adequate information systems; (c) participation of water users and other stakeholders;&#13;
(d) optimization of economic, social and environmental values; and (e) public health considerations.&#13;
14.   Strategy formulation by nature will be a dynamnic iterative process. From the foundation of&#13;
development objectives and water policies, key issues as those above mentioned will be assessed&#13;
and analyzed. The following steps will consist of evaluating options and presenting choices to&#13;
policymakers. The final choice of the options by policymakers will become the adopted strategy.&#13;
However, options evaluation for strategy formulation may reflect back on development objectives&#13;
and water policies which would have to be readjusted.&#13;
15.   The River Basin Councils synthesize two fundamental concepts of Mexico's&#13;
decentralization water policy:&#13;
a) the principal of physical integrity reflected by the basin as a water resources&#13;
planning/management unit is explicitly recognized; and&#13;
b) the principal of solidarity becomes a reality when users within a basin become aware of&#13;
their interrelation with other users and how their actions affect others or conversely how&#13;
they are affected by others' actions.&#13;
16.   With the gradual establishment of River Basin Councils and the corresponding&#13;
decentralization of water resources planning and management, the role of CNA will undergo&#13;
considerable change. At the central level CNA will coordinate the development of water policy and&#13;
strategy in the context of govemment objectives in the areas of economic development, social well&#13;
being, environmental protection, public health, rural and urban planning, decentralization and&#13;
intemational treaty obligations. At the regional levels, CNA will support the River Basin Councils&#13;
by providing them with technical support in the areas of water resources monitoring, planning,&#13;
assessments and management. Regionally, CNA will also function as the Water Authority,&#13;
registering water rights and transfers, and monitoring compliance with the LAN.&#13;
(a) Regional and National Planning&#13;
17.   The formulation of water resources management strategy at the regional and national level&#13;
will cover the following main tasks: Diagnostic, Scenarios, Strategy and Plan.&#13;
a) Diagnostic: Resources Assessment and Main Issues.&#13;
i. Review of socio-economic development objectives and key water related&#13;
policies.&#13;
ii. Assessment of water resources development and use, including an evaluation of&#13;
existing infrastructure. Evaluation of surface and groundwater quality including&#13;
an assessment of the point- and non-point-source of pollution, and the nature of&#13;
any trends over time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F: Water Resources Planning and Information Systems                          5&#13;

the irrigation sector; water conservation in the urban sector; pricing and&#13;
financial penalties; public education and awareness programs.&#13;
iv. Water quality options: establishing, monitoring and enforcement of standards;&#13;
major areas requiring immediate attention, particularly in relation to&#13;
groundwater degradation.&#13;
v. Institutional options: harmonizing and making consistent and coherent&#13;
regulations; structure and management of water supply and sanitation and&#13;
irrigation and drainage organizations; cost recovery and financial autonomy.&#13;
vi. Human resources: short and long term training requirements; employment&#13;
practices and career structures; expertise and cross-disciplinary skills&#13;
development.&#13;
vii. Economic options: economic efficiency in water allocation and reallocation.&#13;
viii. Environment and public health: protection and reclamation of natural&#13;
ecosystems; concept of aquifer reserve as national heritage to be restored and&#13;
protected; improving water quality standards; public education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                               Annex F: Water Resources Planning and Information Systems&#13;
d) Options Evaluation&#13;
i. Definition of evaluation criteria.&#13;
ii. Evaluation of altemative combinations of options (strategies) to achieve&#13;
regional and national objectives, taking into account the following aspects: cost&#13;
recovery and water pricing; services decentralization; private sector and&#13;
community involvement; risks associated.&#13;
e) Regional Plans and National Plan: Orientation Schemes for Water Resources&#13;
Management&#13;
i. The orientation schemes will synthesize the principal findings of previous&#13;
analyses and the set of recommended options, best suited to achieve&#13;
development objectives and support key water policies. Presentation of options&#13;
in simple language understandable to specialists as well as non-specialists and all&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
(b) Establishment of River Basin Councils&#13;
18.   The National Water Law, Chapter IV, articles 3 and 13, define river basins as the water&#13;
resources management units and the river basin councils as the forum for reaching consensus and&#13;
coordination where Federal, State and Municipal governments, the water users and other&#13;
stakeholders can participate in the planning and managing of water resources.&#13;
19.   CNA is reorganizing its regional offices and has identified 13 hydrographic regions that&#13;
cover the entire territory of the country. These regions are presented on the backpiece map and are&#13;
denominated as follows:&#13;
- Baja California Peninsula&#13;
- Upper Northwest&#13;
- Lower Northwest&#13;
- Central Pacific&#13;
- Southern Pacific&#13;
- Northern Border&#13;
- Northern Central Basins&#13;
- Lerma-Santiago&#13;
- Northern Gulf&#13;
- Central Gulf&#13;
- Southern Gulf&#13;
- Yucatan Peninsula&#13;
- Valley of Mexico&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F: Water Resources Planning and Information Systems                        7&#13;
20.   As already mentioned, the Councils of the river basins of Lerma-Chapala, Rio Bravo and&#13;
Valle de Mexico have been established and will be strengthened. The establishment and&#13;
strengthening of the 13 river basin councils will be achieved by the implementation of a series of&#13;
activities in each basin. The activities will be divided into four phases, each one with its specific&#13;
scope and goal. Each phase will be also be a stage for consensus building prior to the&#13;
implementation of the subsequent phase.&#13;
a) Phase 0. Constitution of a Technical Group and a Coordination Group in charge&#13;
respectively of the technical and institutional aspects of the council establishment. The&#13;
Coordination Group will create awareness among water users and stakeholders facing&#13;
critical water problems and issues in the basin for their gathering into a solidarity&#13;
structure and toward the council establishment. A general communicationrmformation&#13;
dissemination program will be initiated to increase public awareness in the basin of&#13;
water resources related matters. The Coordination Group will be supported with&#13;
technical and socio-economic information, and adequate communication material&#13;
prepared by the Technical Group.&#13;
b) Phase 1. Diagnostic of the present situation and implementation of an information&#13;
system for monitoring. The diagnostic and the information system will cover the&#13;
following aspects: assessment of water resources development and use, including an&#13;
evaluation of existing infrastructure in the basin; evaluation of surface and groundwater&#13;
quality including an assessment of the point- and non-point-sources of pollution, and the&#13;
nature of any trends over time; evaluation of the main issues faced in the water sector in&#13;
the basin, including issues related to policy, institutional organization, technology,&#13;
human resources, economic and financial aspects, planning and the environment.&#13;
c) Formulation of Objectives of water quality and water resources allocation.&#13;
Dissemination of information on issues and objectives among water users and&#13;
stakeholders. Discussion, negotiation, striving for consensus on Objectives.&#13;
d) Phase 2. Altemative action plans to achieve the objectives. This phase will correspond&#13;
to the preparation of a water resources management strategy of the basin with long-&#13;
term planning, fornulation of action programs with their investment costs and recurrent&#13;
costs, the implementation agenda, and definition of priorities. Dissemination of&#13;
infomiation on the alternative action plans among water users and stakeholders.&#13;
Discussion, negotiation, striving for consensus on action plan.&#13;
e) Phase 3. Definition of the financing system of the action plan. Formulation of various&#13;
alternative options including water fees, tariffs, loans and other financial instruments.&#13;
The implementation of a computerized financial information system will permit the&#13;
simulation of various hypotheses and determine their viability and sustainability.&#13;
Discussion by the river basin council of the financial option.&#13;
f) Phase 4. Implementation of a monitoring system of Finance/Environment Performance.&#13;
This information system will integrate all the components of the previous systems on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                              Annex F: Water Resources Planning and Information Systems&#13;
water resources, use, planning, action plans and finance into a comprehensive&#13;
management system for continuous monitoring of the achievement in environmental&#13;
enhancement and the state of finance of the council.&#13;
(c) Prospective Studies of Integrated Water Resources Management&#13;
21.   The objective of these studies is to analyze the critical issues of sustainable water use and to&#13;
provide the necessary information to the regional and national plans. The studies to be carried out&#13;
will include:&#13;
a) Alternative technology of water supply and sanitation for rural settlements;&#13;
b) The role of the private sector in hydraulic infrastructure;&#13;
c) The role of water in the agriculture and food sector;&#13;
d) Strategy of salinization control in irrigated areas;&#13;
e) Watershed management;&#13;
f) Optimization model for integrated river basin management;&#13;
g) Monitoring and evaluation of on-going irrigation projects;&#13;
h) Socio-economic, financial, and regulatory aspects of aquifers stabilization in the 13&#13;
hydrographic regions.&#13;
IL Telecommunication and Computer Systems and Water&#13;
Geographic Information System (SIGA)&#13;
A. Background&#13;
22.   In 1994 CNA released an "Institutional Program for the Development of Informatics-&#13;
Programa Institucional de Desarrollo Informatico" for the period 1995-2000. The Program&#13;
provides detailed information concerning the telecommunication, computer resources and&#13;
application software currently in use by the management units of CNA The Program proposed the&#13;
institutionalization of a committee to coordinate-ordinate the infornatic activities of CNA The&#13;
Program also addressed the necessity of training staff and of keeping the skilled telecommunication&#13;
and computer professionals at CNA units. The Program recommends more homogeneous&#13;
approach for the development of systems and acquisition of hardware and software.&#13;
B. Present Situation&#13;
23.   In general, the various CNA offices have obsolete and insufficient telecommunications and&#13;
computer systems, and inadequate information technology staff. Constant insfitutional changes and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F: Water Resources Planning and Infonnation Systaes                        9&#13;
the difficulties to hire and train information technology specialists has lead CNA to deploy&#13;
independent information systems at different sub-management units and with different degrees of&#13;
successes.&#13;
24.   With limited exceptions, data and computer programs are transmitted through the mail, via&#13;
FAX or voice telephone communications. Computer storage and processing capacity are woefully&#13;
deficient.&#13;
25.   Modem Infonmation Technology resources are indispensable for CNA to adequately fulfill&#13;
its water resources management obligations. Practical and rapid solutions are required and can only&#13;
be achieved with systematic and massive use of telecommunications, computer resources and skilled&#13;
staff.&#13;
C. WRMP&#13;
26.   The objective of the telecommunications and computing resources modemization plan is to&#13;
facilitate all CNA technical and administrative offices with basic components to provide an efficient&#13;
flow of information between all offices. The objectives include the instalUation of LANs, WANs,&#13;
workstations, PC's, and essential software that are adequate and unifomn and provide the basic&#13;
elements for common functions such as electronic mail, data base entry and retrieval, analysis of&#13;
data, and reports.&#13;
27.   Each staff person involved with computing resources (data base input, computation,&#13;
analysis, reports, electronic mail, geographic infonnation, simulation modeling, management of&#13;
data, projects, and staff; etc.) will have a desktop display adequate to meet their processing&#13;
requirements.&#13;
28.   The telecommunications and computer resources activities under the WRMP take into&#13;
consideration many of the points addressed by the Programia Institucional de Desarrollo Infornmtico&#13;
(1995-2000) and provides general design guidance for the implementation of a basic&#13;
telecommunication and computer structure for CNA in the period from 1996 to 2001.&#13;
(a) Telecommunications&#13;
29.   In order to provide an efficient means of information flow from the state offices to the&#13;
regional offices and central offices, a telecommunications infrastructure will be designed and&#13;
installed. Each state, regional, and central office will have the basics of a local area network. Each&#13;
local area network will include wiring from the office's central telecommunications area to each&#13;
work site using a technology common throughout CNA. Each office's telecommunications area will&#13;
contain local area network hubs and a connection to the CNA's wide area network which will also&#13;
be implemented as a part of the WRMP.&#13;
30.   The central offices will be inter-connected through the El optical fiber network. CNA will&#13;
connect all state, regional, and central offices with an internal wide area network. Each connection&#13;
will be a minimum of 64 kilobits per second (kbps), also known as EO, in the first phase, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                              Annex F: Water Resources Planning and bnfonmation Sysums&#13;
provisions for expansion to 128 kbps when and where required. Two-way satellite-based system&#13;
(VSAT) will be used. Each regional office will have a remote telecommunication server and&#13;
modems to concentrate data from the stations.&#13;
31.   An Internet connection will be established through the Mexican Autonomous University,&#13;
which is a main Internet provider in Mexico. A CNA network security policy will be established&#13;
from the beginning of the project.&#13;
(b) Computing Resourmes&#13;
32.   In offices where sub-management disciplines such as SIGA, SMN, GASIR, GAS, GSCA,&#13;
etc. are co-located, the computing resources will be shared by the entire office.&#13;
33.   Each state, regional, and central office will have two server-class processors, one NT&#13;
Wmdows and one Unix, on the local area networkl The NT Wmdows server will facilitate present&#13;
and future MS-Wmdows based software tools. Similarly, the Unix server will facilitate present and&#13;
future Unix-based software tools such as Oracle and ARC/Info.&#13;
34.   The capacity of these servers (number and speed of the CPU's, size of mnemory, disk&#13;
capacity, etc.) must meet all minimal software requirements and will be larger in some offices&#13;
proportional to the size of the office's needs. Also, the capacity of these servers must be able to&#13;
grow over time to meet expanding needs.&#13;
35.   Each staff person involved with data base processing analyses, exchange of information,&#13;
etc. will have a desktop display adequate to meet their processing requirements. For uniformitty of&#13;
access to computing resources within and without each office, each desktop display unit uill have&#13;
the ability to display both X-Windows (Unix) and MS-Wmdows.&#13;
36.   Except for specialized equipment required to meet pardcular needs, the core computing&#13;
resources components will be relatively uniform throughout all the offices. This unifority will&#13;
allow procurement to be made in an organized method with great potental for cost savings with&#13;
quantity purchases. Because this modernization plan extends over six years, contracts for purchase&#13;
and maintenance will be wnitten with the minimum requirement immediately with options to procure&#13;
additional resources in the latter years using the same contract.&#13;
(c) Data Bases&#13;
37.   Because of the unique data base requirements by each disciplie, merging of all CNA data&#13;
into a single data base will be difficult, costly and likely impossible. Therefore, each sub-&#13;
management discipline will design and deploy a data base management systemn that meets their&#13;
specific needs for data storage, computation, retrieval, analysis, and reports. Requiements from&#13;
other sub-management disciplines will be requested and met whenever possible, however, the&#13;
efficient data base utilization within a discipline will out-weigh extemal demands. A vital element of&#13;
each data base design is the ability to import and export data in standard fonnats.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F: Water Resources Planning and Information Systems                        11&#13;
38.   To facilitate the transfer of infornation between data bases of differing designs, a data&#13;
exchange software tool will be developed. This tool will have the capability of re-formatting data&#13;
between standard data base formats.&#13;
(d) Water Geographical Information System/SIGA&#13;
39.   In this area, the WRMP will support the strengthening and extension of the existing CNA&#13;
Water Geographical Information System (SIGA) in view to responding to the rapidly increasing&#13;
requirements of various technicaL regional and administrative sectors of CNA. To achieve this&#13;
objective, the following tasks will be carried out:&#13;
a) Extension of the data base structure for future integration of the information subsystems&#13;
to be implemented by WRMP (Groundwater, Water Rights Registry, etc.). This implies&#13;
a system redesign;&#13;
b) System expansion for remote sensing image processing;&#13;
c) General system expansion in georeferenced data processing and system networking; and&#13;
d) System implementation in the regional and river basin councils offices.&#13;
(e) Staffing Support&#13;
40.   Because of its recognized capabilities in the area, a group will be established within GSMN&#13;
responsible for the designs, procurement, developments, deployments, maintenance, and&#13;
progressive recommendations for core telecommunications and computing resources for all of&#13;
CNAN&#13;
41.   Each office (state, regional, and central) will have a staff person (or persons proportional to&#13;
the size of the office) devoted to general telecommunications and computing resources support.&#13;
This person's primary responsibility will be ensuring that all telecommunication and computing&#13;
resource components are operational at their site. When failures occur, this person would be&#13;
responsible for obtaining repairs, restoring lost or damaged files, etc.&#13;
Im Training, Information and Communication&#13;
42.   The training effort in integrated water resources planning and management, and information&#13;
technology will aim to develop and expand the professional skills and capacities of technical staff of&#13;
CNA central and regional offices and of river basin councils. The training program in various&#13;
technical, socio-economic, financial and environmental aspects of water resources management and&#13;
infonnation technology will comprise: (a) short courses offered by national institutions; (b) short&#13;
courses, seminars, and study tours offered by institutions abroad; and (c) national and international&#13;
master programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                              Annex F: Water Resources Planning and Information Systems&#13;
43.   The communication effort will aim to develop awareness from water users, municipal and&#13;
state authorities and other stakeholders about the water issues in their hydrographical basins and the&#13;
necessary shared common effort and solidarity to achieve the common objective sustainable water&#13;
resources development. In addition to the information meetings, seminars and workshops which&#13;
will be organized at each stage of the river basin council establishment, study tours will be organized&#13;
for the representatives of councils members for experience exchange with river basin councils&#13;
abroad.&#13;

WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX G: ECONOMIC ASPECTS, PROJECT BENEFITS,&#13;
AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT'&#13;
L Project Objectives and Strategy&#13;
A. Strategic Responses to Water Management Challenges&#13;
1.    In response to growing water scarcity and deteriorating water quality in Mexico, the CNA&#13;
has intensified its focus on three distinct, but interrelated, activities: planning; the establishment of&#13;
incentive-based institutions; and infrastructure reform. In terms of effective water resources&#13;
planning, the CNA recognizes the importance of water user and other stakeholder participation in&#13;
the preparation and implementation of any water plan. The CNA's focus is therefore on the&#13;
promotion of basin water plans, the preparation and implementation of which take place at the&#13;
local level through River Basin Councils that consist of representatives of water users and other&#13;
interested private and non-private organizations in the basin.&#13;
2.    While the creation of local, River Basin Councils can be viewed as an activity related to&#13;
the creation of incentive-based institutions, the CNA is in the process of creating a number of&#13;
other institutions of this character, provisions for which are an important part of recent federal&#13;
legislation. Examples are as follows.&#13;
a) The CNA is presently completing a program that transfers responsibilities for&#13;
the operation and maintenance of irrigation facilities to water user associations&#13;
in irrigation districts.&#13;
b) The CNA is in the process of completing a National Registry of water users&#13;
which establishespfngible usufructuary water rights that can be traded in water&#13;
markets.&#13;
c) The CNA has established a system of water prices, paid by municipal and&#13;
industrial water users, in an effort to provide incentives for water conservation.&#13;
d) As provided by the Federal Rights Law, the CNA is in the process of&#13;
completing a registry of industrial firms that discharge wastes into water bodies&#13;
(rivers, lakes, and ponds) and of establishing industry-specific quality standards&#13;
for discharged wastes. All unregistered dischargers are subject to a fine.&#13;
3.    Finally, looking to infrastructure reform as a key element of the CNA's strategic response&#13;
to the water/environmental challenges that it faces, the CNA proposes to expand, upgrade and&#13;
modernize the information-based infrastructure that supports the nation's water uses and water&#13;
I     This document presents a sununary of the analyses. A more detailed stand-alone document is in&#13;
the process of being prepared.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                    Annex G: Economic Aspects, Project Benefits, and Environmental Assessment&#13;
quality and, through an intensive training program, to upgrade the human capital required for the&#13;
effective use of that infrastructure.&#13;
B. Information as the key to the CNA strategy: Objectives of the WRMP&#13;
4.    It is surely obvious that reliable data concerning water quantity and quality, "reliable" in&#13;
the sense of being comprehensive in term of content, time, and space, are fundamental requisites&#13;
for success in the implementation of the CNA's strategy described above. Basic to this strategy is&#13;
a process of decision-making and policy formulation regarding the operation and management of&#13;
water resources systems, the enforcement of water use and quality regulations, and investments;&#13;
the quality of such decisions, and the effectiveness of such policies, will depend critically on the&#13;
quality of the data and information that are available to the CNA's decision makers.&#13;
5.    The following examples may serve to further obviate the critical importance of reliable&#13;
information for these functions.&#13;
a) Hydrographic regional planning as contemplated by the CNA's strategy for&#13;
River Basin councils will necessarily involve trade-offs and sacrifices if water&#13;
uses are to be brought into congruence with existing water supplies and&#13;
substantive improvements in water quality are to be realized. The substance of&#13;
considerations by stakeholders of plans that entail the sharing of sacrifices is&#13;
directly related to stakeholders' confidence in the reliability of data used to&#13;
compare alternative plans.&#13;
b) Improved efficiency in the management and operation of surface water&#13;
supplies, as well as operationally efficient and effective responses to flood and&#13;
drought conditions, requires reliable and timely hydrometric and&#13;
meteorological data. The provision of these data require access to modern,&#13;
state of the art, meteorological technologies and facilities, as well as modem&#13;
telemetric and radio communications systems.&#13;
c) If the CNA, in conjunction with the River Basin Councils, is to effectively&#13;
promulgate policies to reduce groundwater overdrafts it must have detailed&#13;
data and assessments that characterize affected aquifers. Such data and&#13;
assessments derive only from modern, comprehensive monitoring and&#13;
information systems and modem computerized modeling techniques.&#13;
d) The promulgation and enforcement of water quality standards is simply&#13;
unworkable without reliable water quality data. The availability of such data&#13;
requires the existence of state of the art water quality laboratories, the&#13;
establishment of national water quality monitoring and information systems,&#13;
and water quality assessments.&#13;
e) The CNA's strategy involving reliance on some forms of water markets is predicated&#13;
on, first, reliable information concerning water availability, and second, on the&#13;
existence of well-defined water rights. The establishment of such rights is dependent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G: Economic Aspects, Project Benefits and Enviromnental Assessment           3&#13;
on the completion of the National Water Rights Registry.&#13;
f) Dam safety is an important and integral part of the CNA's plans to improve the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of water resources management at reservoir&#13;
facilities. Standards for dam safety, required investment programs for&#13;
upgrading and/or redesigning reservoir configurations, and effective emergency&#13;
preparedness programs require information and data that derive from:&#13;
extensive dam inspection; hydrological evaluation of dams; design studies for&#13;
corrective actions; instrumentation and data analyses; and real-time monitoring&#13;
systems.&#13;
6.    The overall objective of the WRMP is therefore seen as that of providing the facilities,&#13;
equipment and training required to generate the fundamental information needs of the CNA's&#13;
strategy for responding to water quality and quantity management challenges in the contemporary&#13;
Mexican environment.&#13;
II. Benefits Associated With The WRMP: Approach&#13;
7.    The standard approach to assessing the feasibility of a proposed project is referred to as&#13;
cost-benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analysis typically involves comparisons of the net value of a&#13;
project-related increase in the production of goods and services with the project's cost. The&#13;
nature of the WRMP does not lend itself well to this standard approach. The objective of the&#13;
WRMP is neither a direct increase in the production of goods and services nor a direct increase in&#13;
social welfare however measured. Its objective is to "produce" data and information.&#13;
Information clearly has value. As noted by Mosley, "Information may be said to be the 'antidote'&#13;
to uncertainty, or the 'raw material from which decisions are made." Thus, it is the use of the&#13;
WRMIP's data and information -- the use of this "raw material" -- that can be expected to directly&#13;
impact social welfare through a combination of such things as increasing agricultural production&#13;
(via increased efficiency of water use), expanding opportunities for industrial growth (via, as one&#13;
example, reallocating water for municipal and industrial uses), ameliorating or eliminating the&#13;
mining of exhaustible natural resources thereby promoting sustainable growth, reducing risks and&#13;
costs associated with dam safety, floods, and drought, improving environmental quality, and more&#13;
generally, improving decision-making processes.&#13;
8.    Benefits or values associated with the WRMP are therefore seen as deriving from&#13;
enhancements in the way that information is organized in the sense of data collection and data use&#13;
in decision making processes. The value of information can be very difficult to measure. It is&#13;
then typically the case that benefits for projects like the WRMP must be estimated by means that&#13;
rely upon measures that are inferential, anecdotal, and indirect in nature. The approach to be used&#13;
here for an assessment of the potential feasibility of the WRMP makes use of all three of these&#13;
measures.&#13;
mII. Precedents For Feasible WRMP-like Projects&#13;
9.    Table G-1 provides examples of results from studies in a large number of countries that&#13;
attempt to estimate benefit-cost measures for the relevant country's expenditures on new,&#13;
upgraded technologies that have been put in place for improving the quality of hydrologic and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                   Annex G: Econornic Aspects, Project Benefits, and Environmental Assessment&#13;
meteorological data. These results provide overwhelming evidence of the benefits that accrue to&#13;
society from investments that have the effect of enhancing the quality of meteorological and&#13;
hydrological data.&#13;
10.   The source of benefits measured in the bulk of the studies cited in Table G-1 derive from&#13;
such things as benefits (to agriculture, public health and safety, transportation, industrial and&#13;
public sectors) from improved weather forecasts, reservoir management, and water resources&#13;
planning. There are still other studies that provide compelling indicators of the feasibility of&#13;
investment project that enhance the quality of hydrological data for other dimensions of end-uses&#13;
that are akin to those relevant for the WRMP. As but a few examples, benefit-cost ratios for&#13;
projects that upgrade facilities for collecting and disseminating streamfiow data are shown to&#13;
range from 2.8:1 to as high as 21.2:1. Benefit-cost measures for collecting and archiving data&#13;
used for the design, sizing, and management of water impoundment facilities have been reported&#13;
to range from 1.7:1 to 2:1.&#13;
11.   A sub-component of the WRMIP's meteorological component has as its purpose the&#13;
commercialization of hydrological and meteorological information. A number of countries have&#13;
realized remarkable success in forming public-private partnerships along the lines contemplated by&#13;
the WRMP. As but one example, a collaborative program between the Japanese Meteorological&#13;
Agency and 20 private meteorological companies serves an estimated market for weather&#13;
information that amounts to around US $200 million/year.&#13;
IV. Anecdotal Indications Of the WRMP's Feasibility&#13;
12.  In this section attention is turned to a brief examination of two sets of selected experiences&#13;
in Mexico that relate to the quantity and quality of hydrological and meteorological data. One set&#13;
concerns the magnitude of damages born by the Mexican population arising from&#13;
hydrometeorological phenomena, damages some part of which would surely be affected by the&#13;
WRMP. The second set concerns Mexico's experiences with what might be regarded as a pilot&#13;
project for the formation of River Basin Councils as a central part of basin water planning. The&#13;
purpose of these examinations is to provide a basis, however limited and perhaps speculative, for&#13;
drawing inferences as to values which might reasonably be expected to accrue to Mexican society&#13;
from the WRMNP.&#13;
A. The Potential Value of Enhanced Meteorological and Hydrological&#13;
Data From Reduced Flood and Drought Damages&#13;
13.   Mexico's geography and topography, with its extended coastlines and concentrations of&#13;
people and economic activity in relatively close proximity to the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, make&#13;
it extremely vulnerable to effects of hurricanes and northward moving cold fronts. Annual&#13;
damages from all hydrometeorological phenomena (rain storms, floods, droughts, freezes, hail and&#13;
wind storms) in Mexico during the period 1987-1994 were: a partial or total loss of production&#13;
from some 1.4 million hectares; a loss of some 38,000 head of livestock; and costs associated with&#13;
human suffering resulting from the destruction of more than 27,000 homes, more than 133,000&#13;
required to evacuate their homes, a loss of life for 181 people, and serious injuries suffered by&#13;
more than 100 people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G: Economic Aspects, Project Benefits and Environmental Assessment           5&#13;
14.   The largest part of these damages from hydrometeorological phenomena arise from floods&#13;
and droughts. In terms of monetary losses, primarily in the agricultural and forestry sectors, the&#13;
greatest losses are caused by drought which average some 1 billion NP (1996 pesos) per year.&#13;
Average annual monetary losses from floods are some 302 million NP. Among knowledgeable&#13;
CNA professionals there is little question that the magnitude of these losses would be substantially&#13;
reduced with more reliable hydrometeorological forecasts, and more reliable and more timely data&#13;
concerning streamflow.&#13;
15.   Among other things, these examples make clear the urgent need for the acceleration of&#13;
efforts to modernize Mexico's hydrometeorological forecasting capabilities.&#13;
B. Basin Planning With Community Involvement:&#13;
The Lerma-Chapala Experience&#13;
16.   As was mentioned above in Section 1.B, an important element in the CNA's strategy for&#13;
improving water management in Mexico is the creation of River Basin Councils made up of&#13;
representatives of stakeholders in the basin that will play a major role in the preparation and&#13;
implementation of basin-wide water management plans. WRMP's financial resources would be&#13;
allocated to these and related planning and management activities which involve the collection,&#13;
use and analysis of hydrometeorological data and information. One can then reasonably inquire:&#13;
on what basis might one expect that such an expenditure is feasible in a benefit-cost sense?&#13;
17.   Such a basis is provided by Mexico's experience with what might be regarded as a pilot&#13;
project for the creation of River Basin Councils: the existing Lerma-Chapala River Basin Council.&#13;
Major water resources-related concerns in this Basin have been: unsustainable withdrawals&#13;
(mining) of water from the Basin's groundwater resources; over use of surface water resources;&#13;
and dramatic declines in water quality in Lake Chapala -- a unique environmental and recreational&#13;
asset to the region and to Mexico. The decline in Lake Chapala's water quality was attributable to&#13;
a combination of two sets of conditions that had evolved over previous decades: a decline in&#13;
freshwater infusions, particularly from the Lerma River, as a result of continuously increasing&#13;
upstream diversions of water for irrigation; and the contamination of river waters from&#13;
unregulated and untreated waste discharges by municipalities and industries.&#13;
18.   It is instructive to review a few of the major accomplishments -- successes -- and major&#13;
failures of this pilot project. The following are the major accomplishments of the Council over&#13;
the relatively brief period 1991-1994. In terms of major accomplishments: 48 new treatment&#13;
plants, treating more than 1.5 billion m3 of waste water per year, have been constructed in the&#13;
Basin with more than 30% of the costs being paid by private or semi-private concessions; an&#13;
agreement was established among stakeholders to reduce surface water diversions in the Basin&#13;
and to make a specific allocation of water to Lake Chapala.&#13;
19.   These are remarkable accomplishments by any standards, and more so (given Mexico's&#13;
past experiences) given the fact that the bulk of these actions were initiated and implemented&#13;
under the auspices of a private-government partnership: the River Basin Council. A primary&#13;
lesson learned from this experience is the potential effectiveness of basin water plans when local&#13;
groups, including Governors of affected States, are directly involved in the planning and&#13;
implementation process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                    Annex G: Economic Aspects, Project Benefits, and Environmental Assessment&#13;
20.   Lessons learned from the River Basin Council's failures are equally instructive for the&#13;
purposes of the assessment of the WRMP. The following are a few examples of such failures and&#13;
lessons. First, the CNA's Regional Office in the Basin has been notably unsuccessful in enforcing&#13;
water quality regulations, a lack of success is attributed to one major cause: the lack of reliable&#13;
data. Second, it is generally recognized that substantial increases in the availability of water could&#13;
result from still greater increases in the efficiency of water use in the irrigation sector. Existing&#13;
inefficiencies in that sector derive, in large part, from the antiquated infrastructure which is used&#13;
to distribute water for irrigation use. Thus, the rehabilitation and modernization of the Basin's&#13;
irrigation infrastructure could accomplish a great deal in terms of making additional water&#13;
supplies available for high valued uses. Finally, effects of floods which are recurrent events in the&#13;
Basin could be substantially reduced by expanding the number of streamflow measurement&#13;
stations in the Basin (there are now only 27), and by improving the quality of facilities and&#13;
equipment used for the provision of hydrological and meteorological data and for modeling and&#13;
analyses of the data.&#13;
V. An Indirect/implied Indicator of WRMP's Feasibility&#13;
21.   An indirect indicator of the WRMP's feasibility can be developed in the following manner.&#13;
There are many activities and events in Mexican society that will be affected by the project.&#13;
Unfortunately, only a small part of these are amenable to measurement in terms of monetary&#13;
values that are associated with them. The activities and events for which monetary values can be&#13;
estinated are the following. Values given below are average annual values measured in millions&#13;
of 1996 NP.&#13;
Agricultural damages from floods:                          302&#13;
Agricultural damages from drought:                        1,020&#13;
Social costs of lives lost in floods:                     1,080&#13;
Hydroelectric power production:                           6,800&#13;
Social costs of degraded water quality:                  13,611&#13;

payments for water use and discharge:                   12,796&#13;
Costs of groundwater mining:                              2,725&#13;
Value of irrigated agricultural production:              _,&#13;
129,047&#13;
22.   These activities, annual values for which total 129,047 million NP, will be affected by the&#13;
project. However, it is not known nor can it be known the magnitude by which these values will&#13;
be affected. Annualized project costs are 230 million NP. It can then be asked: by what amount&#13;
would the values given above need to be affected for the project to be feasible (i.e., have a ratio&#13;
of benefits to costs that equals or exceeds unity)?&#13;
23.   The measure relevant for responding to this question is determined by dividing 230 million&#13;
NP by 129,047 million NP, which yields .00 18. This means that if the project were to affect the&#13;
values given above by only about two-tenths of one percent, the project would indeed be&#13;
economically feasible. The question then becomes: is it reasonable to expect such effects?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G: Economic Aspects, Project Benefits and Environmental Assessment            7&#13;
24.   A 0. 18% effect on virtually all of the values given above is surely more than plausible. For&#13;
example, in terms of flood damages only, such an effect from improved meteorological forecasts&#13;
would derive from a reduction in the annual loss of life from 181 to 150 -- a saving of 31 lives&#13;
which is valued at 230 million NP. Would it be "reasonable" to expect effects of this kind? For&#13;
perspective regarding this question, consider the following. In the Netherlands the estimated&#13;
number of lives saved each year from reduced traffic accidents only, a reduction that is&#13;
attributable to improved meteorological information, is estimated to be between 25 and 63&#13;
lives/year; a comparable estimate of some 200 lives saved per year is reported for the United&#13;
Kingdom.&#13;
25.   As another example, referring only to potential payments of user fees for water use and&#13;
water discharge, the importance of these payments derives from, among other things, the&#13;
incentives that would be placed on polluting entities to rationalize the management of discharges&#13;
of residual waters into the nation's streams via optimal investments in pollution-abatement&#13;
technologies -- an optimization process for which a basic prerequisite is reliable information. In&#13;
this regard, the requirement, as a condition for a feasible project, that these payments be affected&#13;
by less than two-tenths of one percent is virtually trivialized by the CNA's demonstrated success&#13;
with a pilot project wherein the ratio of collections to expenditures was on the order of 12:1 --&#13;
i.e., a demonstrated "benefit-cost" ratio of 1 181 :1.&#13;
26.   Referring finally to a "required" (for project feasibility) two-tenths of one percent&#13;
reduction in the social costs associated with groundwater mining, on its face it is surely reasonable&#13;
to accept such a modest measure of success for the WRMiP: it would require reductions in&#13;
groundwater mining in an amount equal only to the amount of water required to irrigate some 6&#13;
to 7 hectares. The gross underestimate of values that are potentially affected by the project,&#13;
resulting from both omitted values and understated values described above, and the small -- two-&#13;
tenths of one percent -- impact on such values required for project feasibility should suffice to&#13;
persuade even the most skeptical as to the project's feasibility.&#13;
VI. The Economic Feasibility of the WRMP: Conclusions&#13;
27.   In this Annex, it has been shown that expost analyses of investment programs designed to&#13;
improve the reliability of hydrological and meteorological information in many counties&#13;
throughout the world suggest that such programs, like the WRMP, yield benefits that greatly&#13;
exceed costs. Anecdotal evidence has been provided of the potential benefits of the WRMP by&#13;
examining specific instances in which more timely access to more reliable hydrological and&#13;
meteorological information would have resulted in obvious benefits to Mexican society. And it&#13;
has been demonstrated, using data that significantly understate potential values relevant for&#13;
Mexico, that one's conclusion that the WRMP is indeed feasible requires only the most modest&#13;
expectations for its success in affecting values of social significance in Mexico.&#13;
28.   Of course, the reader will draw his or her own conclusions as to the plausibility of&#13;
expecting the WRMP to have the "modest" impacts on relevant social values estimated in this&#13;
section. This discussions of WRMP's feasibility closes with the following observations which&#13;
might be of interest to the reader in this regard. Referring to the "expectation" of a project's&#13;
impacts on social values -- 0. 18% in the case of WRMP, i.e., a "required" rate of return of 0.18%&#13;
-- one might well inquire: what have been such expectations for a required rate of return in other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                   Annex G: Economic Aspects, Project Benefits, and Environmental Assessment&#13;
countries? Two examples are offered. Referring to criteria for hydrological and meteorological&#13;
programs in the U.K., the common goal of such programs is to achieve a minimum threshold rate&#13;
of return of 6%. Finally, Indian engineers reportedly looked to a 10% savings in overdesign costs&#13;
as justifying a WRMP-like project.&#13;
VLL Environmental Assessment of the WRMP - Frame of Reference&#13;
29.   As is the case with "traditional" cost-benefit analysis, discussed above, the WRMP does&#13;
not lend itself well to the "traditional" environmental impact statement. The primary purposes of&#13;
the WRMP do not directly affect processes that produce goods and services, that directly employ&#13;
human resources, that make use of natural and environmental resources, or that directly affect air&#13;
and or water quality. Moreover, in the case of the WRMP there is little in the way of any one-to-&#13;
one relationship between the several project components and any particular set of environmental&#13;
and social effects. In any substantive terms, such components share a common and inextricably&#13;
related goal: improving the quantity, quality, and timeliness of hydrological and meteorological&#13;
information available in Mexico, and enhance the quality of water resources planning in the&#13;
country.&#13;
30.   Given these unique characteristics of the WRMP vis a vis conventional water reclamation&#13;
projects, the approach to assessing social and environmental aspects of the project must be&#13;
correspondingly unique. A qualitative description of many of these social and environmental&#13;
aspects has been given above, and little can be gained by repeating them here. The dramatic&#13;
changes in the CNA's approach to basin wide planning, via reliance on river basin councils which&#13;
is a critical activity supported by the WRMIP, has been described, as have been the activities&#13;
contemplated by the WRMP that relate to dam safety programs and the management of reservoir&#13;
systems.&#13;
31.   Social and environmental aspects of the WRMFP that were not fully explored above&#13;
concern water quality in Mexico, and the potential effects on this important Mexican resource that&#13;
may derive from the WRMP. The intended contribution of this section is therefore to explore&#13;
these aspects.&#13;
A. Social and Environmental Objectives of the Project&#13;
32.   Chapter XIV of the Federal Rights Law contains two provisions that are of critical&#13;
importance for the CNA's mandates for improving water quality: the CNA is given a mandate to&#13;
develop water quality standards (Official Mexican Guidelines and Specific Discharge Provisions)&#13;
which must be met by entities that discharge waste waters in the public domain; and municipal and&#13;
industrial entities that discharge waste waters in the public domain ("water bodies," surface&#13;
waters, surface impoundments, and groundwater) are required to obtain permits (to be registered,&#13;
or "administratively controlled") for such discharges and to pay a fine when chargers fail to obtain&#13;
proper authorization and/or that fail to comply with water quality standards.&#13;
33.   For the CNA to effectively respond to the mandates of current environmental legislation,&#13;
given that it is effectively starting at ground zero, it faces enormous challenges in terms of the&#13;
generation of data requisite for the promulgation of water quality standards, which by law must be&#13;
industry specific, and for the myriad activities required for the enforcement of such standards:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G: Economic Aspects, Project Benefits and Environmental Assessment         9&#13;
identifying dischargers and associated characteristics of discharged waters; monitoring ground and&#13;
surface water quality; and enforcement/inspection procedures.&#13;
34.   The objectives of the CNA, and with the WRMP's support of the CNA substantial&#13;
objectives of the WRMP, are to meet these challenges. The CNA has recently completed a partial&#13;
inventory of water use and waste discharges that provides a point of departure for efforts required&#13;
to respond to its mandates. To date, the CNA's attention has focused on but four measures of&#13;
water quality: biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total&#13;
suspended solids (TSS), and grease and oils (GyO); thus, the CNA has yet to consider measures&#13;
and standards for metals and other toxic contaminants.&#13;
B. The Present State of Water Quality in Mexico.&#13;
35.   A large part of Mexico's population lives in communities whose wastewater is not treated&#13;
before being discharged into rivers and streams. Even in large urban areas with populations in&#13;
excess of 80,000 only about one-fourth of the population's wastewater is treated.&#13;
36.   More specifically in 1994 an estimated 174 m3/s of wastewater were collected through&#13;
municipal sewage systems (4,945 metric tons of BOD/day), and the main industries generated&#13;
about 65 m3/s of wastewater (4,380 metric tons of BOD/day). An estimated 17 m3/s (410 metric&#13;
tons of BOD/day) of municipal wastewaters are treated adequately of a total of 43 m3/s of&#13;
existing capacity, and 5.3 m3/s (329 metric tons of BOD/day) of industrial wastewaters are&#13;
treated. The metropolitan area of Mexico City alone discharges an estimated 42 m3/s wastewater,&#13;
only 17% of which is treated.&#13;
37.   Relatively little appears to be known about water contamination from agricultural&#13;
activities in Mexico.&#13;
C. CNA Plans for Improving Water Quality&#13;
38.   According to the National water Plan 1995-2000, by the year 2000 there will be a 13.5%&#13;
increase in the number of people (an increase of about 10 million people) served by a water supply&#13;
system, and a 23% increase in the number of people connected to wastewater systems. Some 82&#13;
m3/s of municipal wastewaters are expected to receive treatment by the year 2000.&#13;
39.   By Mexican law businesses/industries that discharge waste waters into streams are&#13;
required to register such discharge with the CNA. Registered firms then pay a fee for discharges&#13;
based on volume discharged, and must pay fines if the quality of their discharges exceed standards&#13;
established by the CNA. The CNA has encountered a number of problems in the effective&#13;
enforcement of these laws, however. This lack of success derives from firms' challenges to CNA-&#13;
imposed sanctions in the courts and the CNA's lack of access to data required to prove up its&#13;
claims -- it has great difficulty in proving that contamination in any one stretch of the river is&#13;
caused by a particular industry's waste discharges. In these regards, it is simply the case that the&#13;
CNA has too few monitor facilities in the nation's rivers and streams. Moreover, the CNA has&#13;
the legal power to conduct on-site tests of a company's discharges, but is required to give the&#13;
company a 24 hour notice; not surprisingly, on the day of the CNA's visit to a company, it is not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                    Annex G: Economic Aspects, Project Benefits, and Environmental Assessment&#13;
rare to find the company operating at less than normal capacity and/or not running particular&#13;
processes.&#13;
40.   A major component of the WRMP is the assistance of the CNA's efforts to complete and&#13;
make operational the National Registry of Water Discharges and to expand the development of&#13;
industry-specific water quality standards for waste discharge. Included in this program is an&#13;
intensive program of inspection and measurement visits of 3,300 industrial firms over the period&#13;
1996-2000 for the purpose of "administratively controlling" industrial discharges of residual&#13;
waters. This program expands a pilot project wherein 99 industrial firns were intensively audited&#13;
by the CNA in terms of the quantity and quality of their discharges of waste waters into public&#13;
water bodies. At a cost of 1.6 million NP, the project resulted in the collection of 18.9 million&#13;
NP in unpaid (over some 4-+ years) discharge fees (an amount that would have been greater had&#13;
the CNA had access to the kinds of data that would have allowed their successful response to&#13;
industry challenges of their findings). The implicit benefit/retum-to-cost ratio suggested by&#13;
results from this pilot project -- 11.8-to-I -- has obvious implications for environmental returns&#13;
associated with this data acquisition component of the WRMP.&#13;
D. Concluding Remarks&#13;
41.   The potential contributions to Mexico's efforts to improve water quality is perhaps&#13;
obvious from the discussions of the magnitude of water pollution in the nation given above.&#13;
Investment planning for water treatment facilities clearly benefits from the quality and timeliness&#13;
of data concerning surface and groundwater quantity and quality, the enhancement of such data&#13;
systems and improved modeling and assessments is an important part of the WRMP. Annual&#13;
social costs associated with water contamination are estimated to amount to some 5,725 million&#13;
1996 NP, a level of costs which must surely be at the lower bound of "real" costs when one&#13;
considers that this estimate excludes morbidity and mortality costs associated with contaminated&#13;
waters in Mexico.&#13;
42.   From the above discussions, it is clear that of primary importance for considerations&#13;
related to the improvement of water quality in Mexico are direct discharges of waste waters into&#13;
the public domain by industries -- discharges only 7% of which are treated. Full compliance by&#13;
industries with Mexico's current laws would result in annual payments of fees and fines on the&#13;
order of 13 billion NP -- a level of payment that is not forthcoming at the present time. The&#13;
importance of such collections derives from the incentives that would be placed on polluting&#13;
entities to rationalze the management of discharges of residual waters into the nation's streams&#13;
via optimal investments in pollution-abatement technologies. If the CNA is to make substantive&#13;
progress in bringing about industry compliance with water quality standards it must have the data&#13;
and information required to, first, establish such standards, and second, to enforce them. The&#13;
WRMP provides the support required by the CNA to initiate programs requisite for such&#13;
progress.&#13;
43.   Perhaps conspicuous by its absence from discussions given above is a dimension of&#13;
Mexico's environmental quality that is of particular importance for considerations related to&#13;
sustainable growth and development: the quality of the nation's stock of groundwater. The&#13;
nation's groundwater stocks are being depleted from enormous annual overdrafts, with an&#13;
estimated annual cost of more than 2 billion NP, raising serious sustainability questions, and are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G: Economic Aspects, Project Benefits and Environental Assessment 11&#13;
being contaminated by unregulated discharge of waste waters. The problem, however, is that&#13;
little is known in terms of aquifer characteristics that are central to any effort to ameliorate and/or&#13;
eliminate overdrafts and contamination. An important component of the WRMP is designed to&#13;
support Mexico's efforts to develop the hydrogeological monitoring systems and modeling and&#13;
assessments required to provide the information relevant for the management of this important&#13;
natural and environmental resource.&#13;
44.   In closing, mention was made above of a critically important element in the CNA's&#13;
strategy for improving water management in Mexico: the WRMP-supported creation of River&#13;
Basin Councils, made up of representatives of stakeholders in the basin, that will play a major role&#13;
in the preparation and implementation of basin-wide water management plans which, in turn, will&#13;
be the primary vehicle by which environmental quality is affected in Mexico's water basins. If&#13;
basin planning is to be effective in promoting environmental/water quality, it will be particularly&#13;
important for the CNA to assure that the Councils have available to them individuals with the&#13;
expertise requisite for the design and implementation of environmental plans. Technical analysis&#13;
support to the Councils will be provided by the CNA regional offices. These offices have&#13;
developed regional Project Implementation Plans for the WRMP which include taking into&#13;
account environmental factors in all aspects of river basin planning and management. Each&#13;
regional office will designate or hire as well as train an environmental specialist who will be&#13;
specifically responsible for ensuring environmental adequacy in all aspects of water resources&#13;
management.&#13;

each of the regional offices and in the various technical units (i.e. SGT, GASIR, GSMN, GAS,&#13;

5.    Table H-4 presents a summary of the most important input, output, outcome and&#13;
impact indicators. The nature of these indicators and their baseline values at specific stages of&#13;
project implementation and their target values were agreed upon during negotiations.&#13;
IV. Programming, Budgeting, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
System and Computerized Support System&#13;
6.    A programming, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation system supported by a&#13;
computerized operational system (Project Management system -PMS) would be developed and&#13;
initialized to support project supervision and evaluation prior to the initiation of the project. It&#13;
will be an information and operation system based on the development and use of a data base.&#13;
The PMS will contain and make available information that will permit the continuous&#13;
monitoring of each activity in each phase of project implementation. The information will be&#13;
included in the PMS in a manner that will facilitate the programming, budgeting, monitoring&#13;
and evaluation processes. The PMS will be designed in order to generate tables and reports&#13;
that can be used to evaluate the physical and financial implementation processes of the project.&#13;
7.    The PMS will be structured with five subsystems: Planning, Programming, Execution,&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation.&#13;
8.    Planning . The planning phase includes the activities related to project preparation&#13;
where objectives, strategies, and general policies are developed, and the general project&#13;
physical and financial goals and targets are established. During the implementation phase the&#13;
planning process will include the periodic updating of these project baseline concepts.&#13;
9.    Programming. The programming phase is the development of POAs. In accordance&#13;
with available fiscal and World Bank loan funds, detailed annual plans are developed for&#13;
project implementation that include both physical and financial goals and targets. The POAs&#13;
will be developed detailing the activities, responsible parties, financial resources requirements&#13;
to be carried out in each project subcomponent. The POAs are reviewed by the Executive&#13;
Committee and by the World Bank.&#13;
10.   Execution. The execution phase includes the carrying out of all the activities defined&#13;
in the POAs. It includes: (a) development of terms of references, technical specifications and&#13;
bidding documents; (b) contract bidding, selection, administration and supervision processes;&#13;
(c) direct undertaking of activities to be carried out directly by CNA; and (d) execution of&#13;
training and technical assistance programs This phase also includes the flow of finarinia!&#13;
resources in order to execute the POA activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex: H: Project Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation                       3&#13;
11.   Monitoring. The monitoring phase includes a verification of the satisfactory&#13;
completion of the different activities, or the identification of problems and/or delays.&#13;
12.   Evaluation. The evaluation process will include a determination of why or why not&#13;
goals and targets are being reached, and identifying the reasons and suggesting actions to the&#13;
respective directors. The evaluations will be used as feedback for the planning and&#13;
programming processes. The evaluation process will also include recommendations for&#13;
changes to the current and subsequent POAs, as necessary.&#13;
13.   Design of System. The PMS will be designed to include: (a) the flows of information,&#13;
feedback and decision making, and the interrelationships between the distinctive functions,&#13;
technical areas, and regional offices; (b) the formats and procedures for capturing data; (c) the&#13;
requirements and procedures for report generation; and (d) the development of procedural&#13;
manuals for PMS operation.&#13;
V. Supervision and Monitoring Process&#13;
14.   Based on the information in the POAs about Physical and financial goals, targets and&#13;
schedules, the project coordination staff will monitor and coordinate the implementation of the&#13;
project. The different dependencies of CNA (central and regional) will prepare quarterly&#13;
reports that will be provided to the SGP coordination staff for this process. These reports will&#13;
contain all of the necessary physical, financial and administrative detail for the quarter under&#13;
consideration.&#13;
15.   The SGP project coordination staff will prepare semi-annual reports which will be&#13;
submitted to the World Bank within 60 days following the end of each semester. These&#13;
reports will contain the results of the monitoring and evaluation from the previous six-month&#13;
period and proposals for modifying the current planning and programming processes. The&#13;
May report will also contain the results from the previous year and the November report will&#13;
contain the proposed POA for the upcoming year. These reports will contain detailed&#13;
information on the progress in the implementation of the physical, financial and impact&#13;
indicators.&#13;
16.   The semi-annual reports should contain the following information:&#13;
A. General Status&#13;
1) Major recent developments&#13;
2) Adherence to and deviation from POA&#13;
3) Problems encountered and solutions adopted&#13;
4) Benefits realized to date&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The general objectives of the Water
            Resources Management Project are to: 1) promote conditions
            for environmentally sustainable, economically efficient and
            equitably allocated use of water resources in Mexico; 2)
            support the integrated comprehensive management of water
            resources; and 3) increase the benefits and reduce the risk
            related to existing hydraulic infrastructure. Secondary
            project objectives are to: 1) support groundwater
            conservation by reducing overexploitation and contamination;
            2) promote the restoration of surface water quality; 3)
            improve meteorological services for improved water
            management and for the society and economy as a whole; 4)
            reduce flood damages downstream of reservoirs; 5) improve
            dam safety; 6) improve allocation of water as an economic
            good; 7) promote decentralization of water resources
            management through the establishment and strengthening of
            river basin councils; 8) improve water resources planning
            through the development of the hydrographic region plans
            with river basin council participation; and 9) improve water
            rights administration through registry of water rights users
            and improved fee collection. The project will comprise the
            following components: 1) institutional development,
            technological support and training; 2) water quantity and
            quality monitoring improvement and assessment; 3) reservoir
            operation, dam safety and aquifer management improvement; 4)
            water rights administration; and 5) water resources planning
            and river basin council support.
