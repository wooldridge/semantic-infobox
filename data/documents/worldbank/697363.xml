INTEGRATED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
A. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Guatemala has the largest economy in Central America, with a 1994 GDP&#13;
estimated at $12.9 billion and reported per capita income of $1,242. The economy is&#13;
predominantly agricultural, with more than half of the country's labor force engaged in&#13;
farming, forestry, and fishing. Since 1990 annual growth has averaged 3.9 percent, led by&#13;
the private sector, and inflation was 11.6 percent in 1994.&#13;
2.    Guatemalan social indicators are among the lowest in the Latin American region&#13;
and show only slow improvement, reflecting, among other things, persistent under-&#13;
investment in social services and basic rural infrastructure. Attempts by the Government&#13;
to promote poverty alleviation and increase social spending targeted on the poor have&#13;
been frustrated by serious institutional weaknesses within the public sector. Inadequate&#13;
human resources and personnel management policies, weak tax administration, and&#13;
antiquated financial management and auditing practices have resulted in an inability to&#13;
efficiently manage financial resources or effectively deliver basic services and implement&#13;
investment programs. Consequently, tax compliance is undermined, external donor&#13;
funding is foregone, and ad hoc organizations and mechanisms must often attempt to&#13;
substitute for the public sector in service delivery.&#13;
3 .    Reflecting a desire to strengthen the financial base of the public sector and to&#13;
increase social sector spending, among other things, the Government undertook a&#13;
structural adjustment program supported by the Economic Modernization Loan (EML)&#13;
approved by the Board of Executive Directors in November 1992. The program included&#13;
targets for increasing spending on preventive and primary health care and primary&#13;
education. By late 1993 it became apparent that the targets in health would not be met&#13;
despite the availability of local resources and the commitment of senior government&#13;
officials. A joint review by the Bank and officials of the Ministries of Health and Finance&#13;
revealed that serious administrative deficiencies relating to nearly all aspects in the&#13;
formulation and execution of the budget were impeding the attainment of the targets.&#13;
Although spending on preventive and primary health care was targeted under the EML to&#13;
increase by 15 percent in real terms in 1993 over their budgeted 1992 amounts, actual&#13;
expenditures on preventive care were 39 percent of the target (see table below). Overall&#13;
health and education spending performance reportedly improved during 1994, although,&#13;
spending on preventive health was still below its budgeted target and increased by less&#13;
than $1 million equivalent.&#13;

4.    Recognizing the need for a comprehensive assessment of the financial management&#13;
system, the Government financed with World Bank support a diagnostic study' by&#13;
international experts of the budgeting, accounting, cash management, debt management,&#13;
auditing, and procurement functions in the central government and related human resource&#13;
management and information technology. The report, totaling over 400 pages plus&#13;
annexes, identified pervasive shortcomings in public sector financial management and&#13;
auditing leading to a serious lack of integration and coherence in the government's&#13;
financial management. Senior authorities do not have access to accurate, timely, and&#13;
relevant financial information for decision making; line ministries lack control and&#13;
responsibility over their financial operations; there are high costs in terms of efficiency,&#13;
equity, and transparency; public expenditures can differ significantly from the budget&#13;
approved by Congress; and public confidence in the public sector has fallen to a low level,&#13;
directly affecting government revenues. Recognizing that significant improvement in&#13;
financial management is a necessary precondition to broader public sector reform and&#13;
improved service delivery, the Government has used the recommendations of the&#13;
diagnostic study to design and initiate a reform effort to be supported by the requested&#13;
Bank financing.&#13;
5.    Project Objectives: The overall goal of the project is to strengthen the financial&#13;
management capability of the Government of Guatemala and to help restore public&#13;
confidence in public sector integrity and competence. The project would have two&#13;
specific objectives. The first would be to improve the efficiency, accountability, and&#13;
transparency of the financial management functions of the public sector through&#13;
implementation of an Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF) centered in the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and a modernized Government Auditing System (SAG) in the&#13;
Comptroller General's Office. The second objective would be to improve the delivery of&#13;
public services by supporting the decentralization to line ministries of primary&#13;
responsibility for management of their financial resources.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
6.    Project Concept: The project will produce a modern government financial&#13;
management system through a coordinated reform in the six key areas of budgeting,&#13;
accounting, cash management, debt management, auditing, and procurement. The&#13;
principal integrating factors for the system would be a commonly shared reliable data base,&#13;
generally applied standards and procedures for recording and reporting financial data&#13;
primarily in the accounting sub-system, and establishment of an open mini/microcomputer&#13;
based information technology system capable of communicating the data across the sub-&#13;
systems. Full implementation would permit a timely and single entry of data into the&#13;
system, based on government-wide standards, which become instantly available to all&#13;
users. Legislative action on a broad financial management law conforming all legislation&#13;
to the new system, can and would be delayed until the reforms in the various sub-systems&#13;
have been designed, implemented, and refined.&#13;
7.    In addition to establishing and implementing new standards and procedures for&#13;
financial management as a whole, the proposed project would support an important public&#13;
sector reorganization. Utilizing the principle of regulatory centralization and operational&#13;
decentralization, it would act to transfer financial responsibility and accountability to line&#13;
ministries. Line ministries would assume greater operational control over their budgets,&#13;
supported by internal Financial Management Units (UDAFs). These units, once properly&#13;
established with trained and qualified staff and linked by modern information technology&#13;
to the core agencies, would have responsibility for initial budget formulation and budget&#13;
implementation, accounting, procurement, and cash management. Separate internal audit&#13;
units reporting to Ministers would also be established. The Ministry of Finance and&#13;
Comptroller General's Office would function as rector institutions to regulate and guide&#13;
the overall financial operations of the government and assure the integrity of decentralized&#13;
operations. The UDAFs will be piloted in four institutions, including the Ministry of&#13;
Finance, the Comptroller General's Office, and the line ministries of Health and Education.&#13;
Successful piloting, in addition to refining the program and limiting initial burdens on&#13;
project execution, should act to increase demand from other ministries for financial&#13;
management decentralization. Taking into account the lessons learned, the reforms would&#13;
then be expanded to 16 more central government ministries and institutions.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
8.    The proposed project would have three substantive components. Reform of&#13;
financial management policies and procedures would be supported by long term&#13;
technical assistance provided by a well coordinated team of internationally experienced&#13;
experts in the core sub-systems (budgeting, accounting, cash management, debt&#13;
management, auditing, and team leader), national consultants focused on human resources&#13;
and information technology support, and a limited amount of short term international and&#13;
national consultants (especially in procurement and legal issues as required). Investments&#13;
in information systems, would involve the purchase and installation of computer&#13;
hardware and software systems in 20 institutions commencing shortly after the sub-system&#13;
specialists have begun their work, seeking to conform the information technology to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
policies and manuals being elaborated. The entire computer network should be installed in&#13;
the Ministries of Finance, Health, and Education and Comptroller General's Office within&#13;
24 months, and expanded to the remaining institutions over the following years. Training&#13;
would be provided initially by the consultants in the various sub-systems through a&#13;
continuous series of short courses delivered to managers and technicians throughout the&#13;
Government. Experience suggests that project implementation emphasize both adherence&#13;
to well defined and agreed long term goals and operational flexibility to react to&#13;
opportunities and challenges. Consequently, problem diagnosis and project goals for each&#13;
sub-system as described below, and targets for the first two years, have been carefully&#13;
developed.&#13;
Technical Assistance for Financial Management Reform: ($3.7 million, including&#13;
$3.7 million in Bank financing)&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
9.    Problem: The budget has not been used as an instrument of financial management&#13;
in Guatemala. Although in theory it presents in financial terms the operational plan of the&#13;
government, in fact it has been at best a general guideline for government expenditures.&#13;
The document is prepared by a small core of technical staff in the Ministry of Finance&#13;
based primarily on incremental adjustments in past budgets. The National Planning&#13;
Secretariat (SEGEPLAN) is not actively involved in the programming or budgeting of&#13;
investment projects, although it prepares separately Annual Operating Plans with&#13;
individual ministries, which are not necessarily reflected in the budget. Although program&#13;
budgeting is the stated basis for budget formulation, the budget consists of an excessive&#13;
number of line items relating to an excessive number of budgetary implementing units&#13;
(11,121 in the 1994 budget). This amount of detailed activity is clearly beyond the&#13;
capacity of the budget directorate to formulate, justify, and monitor. During budget&#13;
implementation, requests for transfers, reprogramming and modifications made by the&#13;
ministries have been routinely received and processed, reflecting the excessive detail in the&#13;
budget, its divergence from actual ministerial priorities, and, in addition, poor control over&#13;
spending decisions. In 1993 some 70 percent of the budget was subject to transfers,&#13;
beginning in the first month of the fiscal year. As a result actual expenditures differed&#13;
significantly from the original structure of the budget approved by the Congress.&#13;
10.   Proposed Project Goals and Activities: The project would seek to implant a&#13;
modern budget sub-system which produces an effective financial plan, representing the&#13;
considered priorities of the government and which facilitates control over the expenditure&#13;
of government funds. Key activities would include: (i) preparation and implementation of&#13;
budget formulation, execution, and evaluation manuals; (ii) preparation by the Ministry of&#13;
Finance with executing agencies of a performance indicator catalogue with emphasis on&#13;
investment and service delivery programs; (iii) design and implementation of a new multi-&#13;
year budget document format including spending justifications; (iv) design and&#13;
implementation of measures to conform ministerial Annual Operating Plans and the public&#13;
investment plan with the national budget; (v) design and implementation of a significantly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
reduced number of budget/accounting classifications and budget execution units in all&#13;
ministries; (vi) establishment of clear operating linkages between the Directorate of the&#13;
Budget with the Financial Management Units (UDAFs) in the line ministries; and (vii)&#13;
active participation of the UDAFs in the formulation of the budgets of their respective&#13;
organizations.&#13;
Accounting&#13;
11.   Problem: Accounting in the public sector system is seriously deficient. Ministries&#13;
do not have institutional accounting systems to provide relevant information to their senior&#13;
officials. The State Accounting Directorate within the Ministry of Finance is responsible&#13;
for all accounting functions within the central government, which is limited to simple&#13;
recording of budgeted operations and primary expenditures. The system suffers from&#13;
substantial conceptual deficiencies that cause distortions in the preparation of financial&#13;
reports. There are no accounting manuals and existing standards do not reflect generally&#13;
accepted accounting principles. The Chart of Accounts has 14 types or groups of&#13;
accounts for identifying each of the items or headings, making it necessary to have some&#13;
5,150 divisionary accounts, which is excessive and impractical. The diagnosis revealed&#13;
improper management of the Chart of Accounts which resulted in an inaccurate estimate&#13;
of Government payment arrears because spending commitments were registered as debt&#13;
even before the ordered goods were received. The General Balance Sheet is not based on&#13;
the accounting ledgers, but rather on substitute data, such as inventories of the fixed assets&#13;
and facilities of each implementing unit. The inventories and facilities are not verified on&#13;
the basis of physical inventories, and unofficial documents sent by some of the&#13;
implementing units are taken as reliable.&#13;
12.   Proposed Project Goals and Activities: The project would seek to implant a&#13;
modern accounting sub-system which classifies, records and analyzes in a timely, reliable,&#13;
and standard manner all government financial transactions, with annual financial&#13;
statements prepared by line ministries. The sub-system would provide all basic financial&#13;
transaction data and reports to all other sub-systems. Key activities would include: (i)&#13;
preparation and implementation of a Manual of Accounts, including new technical&#13;
standards based on generally accepted accounting principles, and new regulations for&#13;
government-wide accounting; (ii) design and implementation of a new Chart of Accounts&#13;
which is simple, clear, and flexible; (iii) implementation of an action plan to close accounts&#13;
on government financial performance in a timely manner following the end of the fiscal&#13;
year; and (vi) ensuring proper and uniform accounting treatment of public sector arrears.&#13;
Cash Management&#13;
13.   Problem: Modern cash management should involve the reporting on and control&#13;
of all revenues and payments through a single bank account, and the projection of income&#13;
and expenditure in order to plan financial decisions relating to liquidity investment and&#13;
credit operations. Guatemala's National Treasury, located in the Ministry of Finance,&#13;
functions merely as "paymaster" for daily/weekly decisions taken by an ad hoc group of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
officials that make up a Cash Management Committee, which functions without legal or&#13;
regulatory basis. There is no cash flow plan, as the Treasury is unaware of the flow of&#13;
income and lacks accounting and/or bank movement data for the "Common Fund". The&#13;
Treasury has nine other bank accounts that it uses for various specific purposes. As a&#13;
result of the above, the operating procedure is slow, complicated, subjective, and&#13;
frequently non-transparent for effecting payments.&#13;
14.   Proposed Project Goals and Activities: The project would seek to implant a&#13;
modern cash management sub-system which manages the cash assets of the government&#13;
through projection and monitoring of cash flows, receipt and control of revenues, and the&#13;
processing of disbursements. Key activities would include: (i) preparation and&#13;
implementation of more transparent and simple rules for the processing of payment orders;&#13;
(ii) establishment within the Ministry of Finance of a Cash Management Committee with&#13;
transparent membership, rules, and procedures; (iii) development of a Cash Flow&#13;
Forecasting system to facilitate budget execution; (iv) implementation of a single bank&#13;
account such that the Treasury can exercise better control over revenues and expenditures;&#13;
and (v) establishment of a UDAF-based system of purchase and payment orders to replace&#13;
their processing within the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
Debt Management&#13;
15.   Problem: The internal debt management function is limited in Guatemala. The&#13;
determination of the need and amount of required new domestic public debt is assigned&#13;
informally to a small ad hoc committee. One advisor in the Ministry of Finance handles&#13;
procedural matters and the negotiation of the debt. Control processes for the use and&#13;
recording of debt are rather informal. The issuance of securities and their administration is&#13;
the responsibility of the Central Bank. Although external debt is contracted following&#13;
formal coordination amongst the Ministry of Finance, National Planning Secretariat, and&#13;
Central Bank, there is only limited assessment of its implications for financial flows or the&#13;
country's creditworthiness.&#13;
16.   Proposed Project Goals and Activities: The project would seek to implant a&#13;
modern debt management sub-system which manages the acquisition, servicing, and&#13;
retirement of public debt. Key activities would tentatively include: (i) establishment of a&#13;
National Commission on Public Credit comprised of the Ministry of Finance (chair), the&#13;
Central Bank, and National Planning Secretariat; (ii) establishment of an appropriate&#13;
structure within the Ministry of Finance for implementing the policies of the National&#13;
Commission; (iii) establishment of a rolling multi-year debt plan; (iv) establishment of a&#13;
debt management information system; and (v) presentation to the Congress of draft&#13;
legislation enabling the Executive Branch to contract debt or guarantees with multilateral&#13;
financial institutions under a mechanism which shall not require specific approval of every&#13;
operation to the extent it does not exceed annual limits pre-established by the Congress&#13;
within its powers under the Constitution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Auditing&#13;
17.   Problem: Modern auditing involves three processes: (i) internal control through&#13;
mechanisms in government agencies for authorization of purchases, cash management,&#13;
asset custody, and personnel functioning in the executive branch; (ii) internal auditing&#13;
through the a posteriori examination of accounts and supporting documentation, review&#13;
of financial operations, and financial and operational audits performed by an entity within&#13;
the organization; and (iii) external audit, which has similar functions as internal auditing,&#13;
except that it is performed by an external entity. In Guatemala, the audit function is&#13;
governed by a law that went into effect more than 70 years ago and modified slightly in&#13;
the mid-1950s, and as such does not reflect modern internal control and audit processes.&#13;
As the law requires a review of "all" supporting documentation for income and&#13;
expenditure of funds, there is a backlog of several years in the reviews which means that&#13;
they have virtually no effect on the determination of accountability. The Office of the&#13;
Comptroller General is an agency of the Congress, but must rely on the often unreliable&#13;
data provided by the Executive Branch. The Comptroller General's Office itself has&#13;
relatively few professional auditors, focuses most of its resources on routine administrative&#13;
reviews, conducted only 14 audits in 1993, prepares no audit plans nor systematizes audit&#13;
methodology, has no procedures to evaluate audits, and does not continuously train its&#13;
staff. Internal audit units in ministries have frequently distorted the practice of auditing&#13;
into pre-control of operations and/or inspection and verification of tasks that are irrelevant&#13;
and that are the responsibility of the management of each entity. These units do not&#13;
provide advisory assistance to senior management. Given this situation, auditing of&#13;
externally financed projects is generally performed by private firms.&#13;
18.   Proposed Project Goals and Activities: The project would seek to implant a&#13;
modern, comprehensive, and independent audit system which ensures fair, objective, and&#13;
reliable external reviews of government performance based upon sound internal control&#13;
structures in each agency and professionally staffed internal audit units. Key activities&#13;
would include: (i) a restructuring of the functioning and administrative rules of the&#13;
Comptroller General's Office; (ii) design and implementation of technical standards for&#13;
audits for use by the Comptroller General's Office and the ministerial Internal Audit Units,&#13;
including standards for responding to audit report recommendations and qualifications;&#13;
(iii) preparation and implementation of a Manual of Government Audit; (iv) preparation&#13;
and implementation of a plan for professionalizing the audit career in government; (v)&#13;
establishing annual plans for public sector audits; (vi) design, and implementation of&#13;
regulations to utilize private firms to audit accounts of government entities; (vii)&#13;
preparation and presentation to the Congress a modern Organic Law of Auditing in&#13;
conformity with the broader financial management reforms; and (viii) strengthening of the&#13;
Auditing School within the Comptroller General's Office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Procurement&#13;
19.   Problem: To maximize expected gains in transparency and efficiency, the&#13;
modernization of the financial management system would benefit from complementary&#13;
reforms in the public sector's procurement practices. The current procurement system has&#13;
suffered from severe deficiencies due to distortions in the application of the law and its&#13;
regulations. Procurement has been decentralized without providing for oversight by any&#13;
governing entity to issue standards and procedures, evaluate the proper functioning of the&#13;
system, or give transparency to the public contracting process and maximize its efficiency.&#13;
Each of 540 administrative offices and 37 decentralized entities throughout the&#13;
government is able to order goods and frequently does so at prices that are significantly&#13;
higher that those prevailing on the local market. Most purchases are through "open&#13;
contracts" through which purchases can be made for any quantity of products, provided&#13;
that they do not exceed a unit value of $5,000 equivalent. Entities can buy under "open&#13;
contracts" without reference to price after receiving proposals from a least three approved&#13;
suppliers. Nearly one-third of the suppliers on the Suppliers Registry are phantom firms&#13;
or have anomalous operations. It is estimated that the Ministry of Health purchased&#13;
during 1993 twenty basic pharmaceuticals at prices between 164 percent and 371 percent&#13;
higher that the average international price. Excessive quantities are frequently bought and&#13;
the goods are generally of low quality as technical specifications are vague and incomplete&#13;
and product quality is often not taken into account. All purchase and payment orders are&#13;
physically processed semi-manually in the Ministry of Finance, even though more than 60&#13;
percent of purchases are for less than $2,000 equivalent, generating significant paper&#13;
work. Payment orders are physically returned to the point of origin when any of many&#13;
detailed requirements are not met.&#13;
20.    Proposed Project Goals and Activities: The project would seek to implant a&#13;
modern procurement sub-system which would procure goods and services in a&#13;
transparent, decentralized, and timely manner with appropriate regard to price&#13;
competition, quality control, and administrative expense. Key activities would include: (i)&#13;
strengthening the recently created Directorate of Procurement within the Ministry of&#13;
Finance to serve as the rector institution to develop procurement guidelines and monitor&#13;
their implementation (including the preparation of a registry for frequently procured goods&#13;
and services to assist in the monitoring of prices, qualities, and technology); (ii)&#13;
establishment of transparent procurement regulations and procedures for use in all&#13;
contracting units; (iii) creation of ministerial level procurement functions within U.DAFs&#13;
responsible for overseeing procurement within the ministry and the development of annual&#13;
procurement plans for inclusion in the budget formulation process; (iv) establishment of a&#13;
central information system to report on government purchases; (v) creation of a new&#13;
Suppliers Registry that is transparent and open to competition; (vi) reform of the system&#13;
of "open contracts" to promote price competition and quality control; and (vii)&#13;
preparation and presentation of draft procurement legislation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Information Systems: ($4.3 million including $4.0 million in Bank financing)&#13;
21.   Problem: While not a substantive sub-system per se in a financial management&#13;
system, the character of information technology utilized by a government (or other&#13;
organization) can significantly affect the accuracy, transparency, and timeliness, and&#13;
consequently the design of the broader system. The information technology utilized by the&#13;
Guatemala Government to manage its financial operations is inadequate, hampering its&#13;
ability to modernize. Until 1991 the Finance Ministry information system was based on a&#13;
central mainframe computer purchased in 1984 which handled the main financial&#13;
operations (revenue, salary payments, purchases). A subsequent downsizing process was&#13;
begun without adequate planning. The Computer Services Directorate does not have a&#13;
leadership role in the Finance Ministry, due in part to its low pay and lack of qualified&#13;
staff, and is frequently at variance with other Finance Ministry units which have created&#13;
their own isolated information technology units. Consequently no standards or criteria&#13;
have been established for hardware and software procurement; the development of&#13;
computerization has been uneven and uncoordinated, resulting in systems within the&#13;
Ministry which cannot communicate together; and the new systems which have been&#13;
established are comprised of hardware of various makes and quality and are not subjected&#13;
to preventive maintenance. The mainframe continues to perform some functions although&#13;
the government is anxious to transfer its operations before it ceases functioning.&#13;
22.   Proposed Project Goals and Activities: The project would seek to implant a&#13;
modern, mini/microcomputer based, open information technology network supporting an&#13;
integrated financial management system in all ministries, which, among other things,&#13;
would provide data to a principal government-wide financial data base. Key activities&#13;
would include: (i) transforming the Computer Services Directorate within the Ministry of&#13;
Finance into the rector institution for the public sector with regard to policies and&#13;
protocols for information technology; (ii) assessment of the existing computer technology&#13;
in ministries and design of a plan to convert to an open, mini/microcomputer based&#13;
integrated system; and (iii) procurement of hardware and software, and installation of an&#13;
integrated information technology system for financial management in the Ministries of&#13;
Finance, Health, and Education, and the Comptroller General's Office, and subsequently in&#13;
all participating institutions.&#13;
23.   Recognizing the need for carefully designed and sequenced information technology&#13;
investments to support its financial management reforms, the Government has proposed a&#13;
four year program for differentiated investments at the center and at line institution levels.&#13;
The SIAF central system at the Finance Ministry is projected to require a mini-computer&#13;
with capacity to handle 64 work stations to support the accounting, budget, cash&#13;
management, debt management, and procurement sub-systems. Different configurations&#13;
would be required for four large ministries, three medium sized ministries, eleven smaller&#13;
ministries and institutions, and the Comptroller General's Office. The estimated cost of&#13;
hardware and communication linkages is summarized in Table 1. The investment would&#13;
take account of existing information technology in the public sector, and is considered the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
minimum necessary to appropriately support the policy and procedural reforms&#13;
contemplated. The systems would be brought on-line in a staged manner starting the&#13;
project's second year. In conjunction with other countries in the region implementing&#13;
integrated financial management programs, the Government will investigate the feasibility&#13;
of purchasing and customizing already developed public sector software packages in lieu&#13;
of developing its own software.&#13;

Support for Training: ($0.8 million, including $0.4 million in Bank financing)&#13;
24.   Training would be a key component of the project, primarily conducted by the&#13;
international experts in each sub-system, whose qualifications would include pedagogic&#13;
experience. Training would be primarily in the form of short but intense and formal&#13;
courses with certificates of advancement. Courses would be aimed at all technical, middle&#13;
management, and senior level officers involved in financial management. Intensive training&#13;
would also be provided in information technology, and for the proposed UDAFs so that&#13;
they could adequately perform the responsibilities to be devolved to the line ministries.&#13;
The courses would be conducted in the Training Center of the Ministry of Finance, which&#13;
is well equipped and located to support in an effective and cost efficient manner their&#13;
presentation. Special attention would be given to the development of national training&#13;
capacity, both within the government, and with professional organizations and universities&#13;
in Guatemala. Financing is also proposed for a limited number of observational visits to&#13;
investigate financial management systems in operation in the Latin American region. A&#13;
detailed training plan is attached as Schedule 2.&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
25.   Total project costs, as shown in Table 2, have been estimated at $10.5 million over&#13;
the four-year project life. Bank financing of $9.4 million equivalent would cover&#13;
approximately 90 percent of project costs while the Government would finance the&#13;
remainder. The loan would cover: (i) long and short term international consultants ($2.9&#13;
million); (ii) national consultants ($0.8 million); (iii) the purchase and installation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
computer hardware and software ($4.0 million); (iv) training ($0.4 million); (v) project&#13;
management including office equipment ($0.5 million); and (vi) contingencies ($0.8&#13;
million). The information technology component would aim at a modern and open system&#13;
with a modest but sufficient capacity to support an integrated financial management&#13;
system in line ministries and to provide the basis for expansion later to decentralized&#13;
agencies and local governments. The Government would provide counterpart financing in&#13;
the form of salaries, training contributions, and logistical support equivalent to $1.1&#13;
million.&#13;

B. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Organization and Implementation&#13;
27.   An Executive Committee comprised of the Minister of Finance and the&#13;
Comptroller General, to be established by Presidential Decree and the separate Circular A-&#13;
10-95 already issued by the Office of the Comptroller General, will provide policy&#13;
oversight to the project and be responsible for its implementation. The Committee would&#13;
be supported by a small staff, headed by a National Director, which would act as the&#13;
Project Management Unit. The unit, located in the Ministry of Finance, would include&#13;
consultants with relevant international experience in integrated financial management (in&#13;
the areas of budgeting, accounting, cash management, debt management, and auditing)&#13;
and national consultants especially in the areas of procurement, human resources,&#13;
infonnation technology, and law. It would include a specialist to ensure appropriate&#13;
coordination between the project and the ongoing health sector reform effort. This&#13;
consultant would also act to oversee the development of the UDAFs in line ministries. A&#13;
lead international consultant would serve as the International Technical Director of the&#13;
project, and be charged with overseeing and coordinating the substantive work of the&#13;
consultants. The Executive Committee would seek the advice when it deems necessary of&#13;
a Technical Committee composed of senior officials in the Ministry of Finance and&#13;
Comptroller General's Office. It is anticipated that the UNDP office in Guatemala would&#13;
assist the Government in project administration including the hiring and payment of&#13;
consultants and procurement of goods and services. This would reduce the administrative&#13;
burden on the project management unit and better ensure the continuity and quality of&#13;
services provided.&#13;
28.   A major task for the Executive Committee would be to ensure an adequate human&#13;
resource base for the integrated financial management project. Activities for the&#13;
government would entail the evaluation of existing staff capabilities, reassignment of&#13;
redundant staff, and recruitment of qualified personnel for the relevant financial units in&#13;
the Ministry of Finance and Comptroller General's Office and line ministries, and the&#13;
design and implementation of remuneration practices sufficient to attract and maintain&#13;
qualified staff in key units. Some flexibility in the hiring and remuneration of contracted&#13;
staff exists in the public sector and the Government has requested an IDF grant to finance&#13;
a diagnostic review of civil service policies and to strengthen human resource management&#13;
institutions.&#13;
29.   The sequencing of project activities is outlined in the attached matrix of project&#13;
indicators. Key project priorities and approximate timing, with appropriate variations for&#13;
each sub-system, include the following: (i) review of diagnosis and adjustment of project&#13;
details as necessary and agreed with the Bank within 6 months following recruitment of&#13;
key consultants; (ii) preparation of detailed sub-system procedures and manuals (budget&#13;
formulation, Manual of Accounts, Chart of Accounts, etc.) within 12 to 24 months; (iii)&#13;
initiation of sub-system reform implementation during the second year, as well as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
initiation of intensive staff training, (iv) creation of UDAFs in four pilot institutions by the&#13;
end of the second year and refinement of processes during third year; (v) installation of&#13;
information technology within core financial agencies and four pilot institution UDAFs&#13;
within 24 months; (vi) preparation of draft financial management legislation after the third&#13;
year; and (vii) expansion of reforms including UDAFs, training, and information&#13;
technology to remaining central government institutions between the third and fourth&#13;
years. This time frame has been extensively reviewed with senior and middle level officials&#13;
within the Government.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
30.   Contracts for goods (primarily computer equipment and software) shall be&#13;
packaged in lots valued at $100,000 equivalent or more and would be procured through&#13;
Limited International Bidding (LIB). LIB procedures are justified given the small number&#13;
of providers with after-delivery service in Guatemala. Goods estimated to cost less than&#13;
$100,000 and more than $25,000 would be procured through international shopping and&#13;
contracts below $25,000 equivalent for other goods and equipment would be procured&#13;
through local shopping, up to an estimated aggregate amount of $100,000 for all shopping&#13;
procedures. Standard Bank Bidding Documents would be used for LIB procedures.&#13;
Consultants, whose qualifications are satisfactory to the Bank, would be selected for&#13;
technical assistance and training services under the project in accordance with Bank&#13;
Guidelines and under terms of reference and employment conditions satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank. All Bank-financed consulting contracts estimated to cost more than $25,000 and all&#13;
LIB procurement documentation will be subject to prior review by the Bank, as well as&#13;
consulting contracts for critical assignments. These review arrangements would provide&#13;
for Bank review of approximately 90 percent of the value of all contracts financed by the&#13;
Bank. The Government would enter into a cost sharing arrangement with UNDP whereby&#13;
the UNDP field office will assist the Government in the hiring and paying of consultants&#13;
and the procurement of equipment in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
Disbursements and Financing&#13;
31.   The project is expected to be implemented over a four year period. Disbursements&#13;
would be made as specified in Schedule B and would be administered by the Executive&#13;
Committee. All withdrawal applications would be fully documented, except for&#13;
expenditures under contracts for goods valued below $100,000 equivalent and consultant&#13;
contracts (both firms and individuals) valued at or below $25,000 equivalent. The&#13;
minimum amount of any withdrawal request should be $50,000 equivalent. Retroactive&#13;
financing up to $900,000, approximately 10 percent of the loan amount, would be&#13;
available for eligible expenditures, primarily consultant services, incurred after January 30,&#13;
1995. Annual audit reports would be produced, starting in December 1995, at the end of&#13;
each calendar year and submitted to the Bank within six months after year end. The&#13;
expected project completion date is June 30, 1999 and the Closing Date would be&#13;
December 31, 1999. An implementation completion report would be prepared by the&#13;
Government and submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the Closing Date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
32.   The Bank will supervise the implementation of the loan through frequent and&#13;
regular supervision missions, and at other times as needed or requested by the&#13;
Government, with a total annual IFML-related supervision input of approximately 15 staff&#13;
weeks. The Government has given assurances that: (i) it would provide the Bank with&#13;
semi-annual progress reports; (ii) annual reviews of project implementation would be&#13;
conducted jointly by the Government and the Bank no later than March 30 of each year&#13;
starting in 1996 including project performance against the matrix of key project activities&#13;
and implementation targets; (iii) a comprehensive mid-term review would take place no&#13;
later than June 30, 1997, replacing the annual review, in which the following, inter alia,&#13;
would be discussed additionally: (a) the new Administration's assessment and continued&#13;
commitment to the reform program; (b) overall progress of the reform program,&#13;
particularly the integration of separate component activities into a cohesive and&#13;
complementary set of actions; (c) institutional capacity to carry on project activities; and&#13;
(d) project redesign or corrective actions, as needed; and (iv) the government will&#13;
substantially achieve the implementation targets in Schedule 1. Terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank would be prepared by the government for the mid-term review.&#13;

Future Project Expansion&#13;
The Project activities would be expanded to public sector entities other than the&#13;
pilot ones, if so agreed from time to time between the Borrower and the Bank, in light of&#13;
availability of remaining resources, goals and objectives achieved, lessons learned and&#13;
degree of success in implementation by pilot institutions, and achievement of the&#13;
respective priorities. The corresponding agreement for each expansion shall be&#13;
instrumented by accordingly amending this implementation Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Schedule 2&#13;
Training Plan and Budget&#13;
Guatemala Integrated Financial Management Loan&#13;
1.    Training would constitute an important part of the Government's Financial&#13;
Management Reform program as the availability of senior and middle managers and&#13;
technicians knowledgeable about and supportive of the policies, standards, and procedures&#13;
being developed under the program is critical to its success and sustainability.&#13;
2.    Training under the SIAF/SAG project will be directly tied to the project's specific&#13;
objectives and products (standards, manuals, organizational changes, etc.). Training&#13;
schedules will be coordinated with the timing of the project products such as the&#13;
completion and adoption of a manual, budget formulation and accounting deadlines,&#13;
implementation of a new organization scheme, etc.&#13;
3.    The candidates for training would be the senior and middle managers, and&#13;
technicians from the core financial agencies (for example the entire staff of the&#13;
Directorates of the Budget, Accounting, Treasury, etc. in the Ministry of Finance and the&#13;
auditors in the Comptroller General's Office) as well as the staff of the Financial&#13;
Management Units (UDAFs) and Internal Audit Units to be established in the line&#13;
institutions. It is anticipated that during the project period up to 4,000 individuals could&#13;
be trained.&#13;
4.    Since training activities should not be overly disruptive of the government units'&#13;
work schedules, it is anticipated that training modules would be kept relatively short, with&#13;
a maximum duration of 20 to 40 hours for broader issues, and 8 to 20 hours for more&#13;
specific issues. Half-day instruction units will give flexibility to module-delivery and will&#13;
help minimize disruptions. Training modules will have an evaluation component, thus&#13;
instructors must develop the necessary test material. Certificates or diplomas will be&#13;
extended only to those passing courses. Participation and approval information will be&#13;
communicated to supervisors and registered in personnel records. Statistics will be&#13;
maintained on the training program in order to explain progress achieved. Qualitative and&#13;
quantitative performance indicators for the training will also be developed at the beginning&#13;
of the program.&#13;
5.    Training would be provided by the sub-system consultants working in the project.&#13;
For example the internationally experienced consultant hired under a long term contract to&#13;
provide technical assistance in the reform of the budget sub-system would give the courses&#13;
related to the proposed budget system, the drafted and approved Budget Formulation&#13;
Manual, and the drafted and approved Budget Execution manual. Pedagogic experience&#13;
would be a criterion for selection of the long term consultants. Between the 12th and 24th&#13;
month of the project each international consultant may have to dedicate as much as 25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
percent of their time to training activities, as standards, manuals, and systems are officially&#13;
adopted.&#13;
6.    At the beginning of the project, the intemational technical director jointly with the&#13;
national director will identify individuals within the public sector with the qualifications&#13;
and ability to become trainers under the project. Trainers currently working at&#13;
government training centers will be preferentially considered in order to reduce selection&#13;
time and scope. Arrangements will be made to have selected individuals assigned as&#13;
national counterpart staff for the duration of the project. They will initially assist the&#13;
international consultants in the planning of training activities and in the design and delivery&#13;
of first-stage project seminars, becoming full trainers thereafter. Instructor manuals will&#13;
be prepared to facilitate the training of trainers on a continuous basis in the public sector.&#13;
The project directors will also make arrangements with local universities to provide&#13;
project training to faculty members, pursuing multiplier effects, promoting project&#13;
research, and assisting in thesis work to identify potential candidates for trainer positions&#13;
as the project spreads to participating institutions. This type of approach to the training of&#13;
local trainers has been successfully pursued in similar projects. In time once local staff can&#13;
assume more responsibility for training, the international consultants would concentrate&#13;
more on specialized on-the-job and problem-solving training.&#13;
7.    Courses to be presented, based on the experience of other countries implementing&#13;
similar projects, could include the following:&#13;
Accounting&#13;
- Principles and standards for the preparation and submission of financial information&#13;
- Conceptual principles of the government accounting system&#13;
- Analysis of the Chart of Accounts&#13;
- Government Accounting&#13;
- Accounting consolidation and integration&#13;
Budget&#13;
* Introduction to the national budget system&#13;
* Budget formulation and programming&#13;
* Budget execution&#13;
Cash Management&#13;
* Introduction to the national treasury system&#13;
* Cash management and cash flow techniques&#13;
Debt Management&#13;
* Introduction to the external and internal public debt system&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* Public debt instruments and techniques&#13;
Audit&#13;
*  General concepts and evaluation of internal controls&#13;
*  Audit Standards - (series of modules on annual internal audit plan, the audit report,&#13;
internal audit work papers, evaluation of internal controls&#13;
*  Financial, performance, and fraud audits&#13;
*  Supervision of the audit function&#13;
* Government external audit&#13;
8.    Training in information technology will be delivered in part by the suppliers of the&#13;
hardware. In addition, large-scale government-wide training of analysts and programmers&#13;
will also be required, as will training for end-users on the use of the new tools and&#13;
systems.&#13;
9.    Most training would be provided in the training facilities of the Ministry of&#13;
Finance, which appear adequate to the task in terms of convenience, space, equipment,&#13;
and organization capacity. Although some $400,000 is included in the Bank loan to help&#13;
meet the costs of training (reproduction of documents such as manuals, and limited&#13;
observational travel), the Government will meet the bulk of training costs (printing and&#13;
photocopying, equipment and premises) out of its counterpart funds. In addition, the&#13;
training center in the Ministry of Finance would seek to support the training delivery of&#13;
the individual consultants, help identify national staff capable of continuing the training&#13;
efforts, and help in the design and production of training material. Training modules will&#13;
be supported as necessary by multi-media didactic material, including printed manuals,&#13;
exercises and tests, slide and overhead projections, computer aids, etc. The instructors&#13;
themselves will be in charge of the development of such didactic material. Auditing&#13;
courses may be presented at the Office of the Comptroller General.&#13;
10.   Finally, it is anticipated that the project must insert itself into the community and&#13;
work closely with professional and trade associations related to SIAF/SAG areas and with&#13;
Guatemala's economic/financial press. General presentation on the project's progress&#13;
should be prepared and maintained updated for this purpose. Also, specific training&#13;
modules could be occasionally imparted to these organizations. The project should also&#13;
work with the country's major universities, working closely with administration and&#13;
faculty to influence the upgrading and updating of study plans as project benchmarks&#13;
occur and products are delivered and adopted. Training modules imparted to faculty&#13;
members have and important multiplier effect on the student population and thus are&#13;
particularly cost-effective.&#13;

            Guatemala - Integrated Financial Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall goal of the Integrated
            Financial Management Project is to strengthen the financial
            management capacity of the Government and to help restore
            confidence in public sector integrity and competence. The
            project will have two specific objectives. The first will be
            to improve the efficiency, accountability, and transparency
            of the financial management functions of the public sector
            through implementation of an Integrated Financial Management
            System (SIAF) centered in the Ministry of Finance and a
            modernized Government Auditing System (SAG) in the
            Comptroller General's Office. The second objective will
            be to improve the delivery of public services by supporting
            decentralization to line ministries of primary
            responsibility for management of their financial resources.
            The project comprises three major components: 1) reform of
            financial management policies and procedures supported by
            outside technical assistance; 2) investment in information
            systems involving the purchase and installation of computer
            hardware and software systems; and 3) a training component.
