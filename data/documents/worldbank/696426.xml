This report was prepared on the basis of an appraisal mission to Poland in October 1995. The&#13;
mission was led by Marc Juhel (Senior Port Specialist, TWUTD). Mission members were Messrs.&#13;
Enn Vasur (Senior Transport Economist, EC2ET), Piotr Krzyzanowski (Environment Specialist,&#13;
EMTEN), and William Hayden (Financial Analyst, Consultant). Peer reviewers are Messrs. Jacques&#13;
Yenny and Kek Chung. The Division Chief is Mr. Hans J. Apitz (EC2ET) and the Department&#13;
Director Mr. Jean-Michel Sevefino (EC2DR).&#13;

L. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1          Poland possesses extensive transport networks and facilities. Related to country area,&#13;
313,000 km2, and population, 38 million, transport densities are at an average European level. The&#13;
system includes about 360,000 km of roads of which more than 60% are paved (109 km/I 00 km2, EU:&#13;
128 km/100 km2), some 24,000 km of railway lines, of which 49% are electrified (EU: 38% on&#13;
average), three major ports with international traffic (Gdansk, Gdynia, Szczecin-Swinoujscie), close to&#13;
4,000 km of inland waterways, and four airports with scheduled intemational connections as well as a&#13;
large number of domestic airports (see IBRD Map 27435).&#13;
1.2          The present situation in the sector is shaped by two main factors: the legacy of the past&#13;
and the ongoing restructuring of the economy. In Poland, as elsewhere in Eastem Europe under the&#13;
former system, there was a general lack of competition, pricing was unimportant, and enterprises were&#13;
vertically integrated, providing their own technical and social services. There was a high degree of&#13;
centralization in decision-making. In the transport sector this led to a small number of very large&#13;
organizations, some with hundreds of thousands of employees. A deep transformation of objectives,&#13;
policies, legal and regulatory frameworks, structures and operations is now underway to enable the&#13;
sector to break away from state owned, centrally controlled monopolies geared to meet mainly physical&#13;
targets with scant regard for quality, financial and other efficiency criteria.  At the same time,&#13;
modemization of certain parts of the sector and a geographic redirection of emphasis for closer&#13;
integration with the economies of Westem Europe are of high priority.&#13;
1.3          This transformation has already achieved notable results. Partly as a consequence of&#13;
the transformation but also because of the severe drop in industrial output experienced during the first&#13;
years of the process, there has been a significant drop in traffic, especially for the railways, but the ports&#13;
have also been affected. However, following the mounting recovery of the national production system,&#13;
an upward trend seems to have taken root, in particular as far as intemational traffic is concerned.&#13;
B. Foreign Trade&#13;
1.4          During the last five years, Polish exports reached a level in the range between US$13&#13;
and US$17 billion. The highest level was reached in 1994 with US$16.9 billion, a 25% increase over&#13;
1993. Imports of goods increased sharply over the period and reached US$17.8 billion in 1994, an&#13;
increase of 12% over 1993, but a total increase of 52% compared with 1990.&#13;
1.5          The major import products are those of the electro-engineering industry, the chemical&#13;
industry, and the energy sector. Imports from the chemical industry make up for 18% of total imports,&#13;
whereas petroleum products and gas make little more than 10%.&#13;
1.6          For the coming period it can be expected that Polish exports will focus on commodities&#13;
which take advantage of low labor costs, as in the textile and clothing industries, woodworks and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
metalworks industries. Export opportunities for agriculture and labor-intensive industries could further&#13;
be enhanced through Poland's accession to the European Union.&#13;
1.7          These evolutions will have direct consequences for the demand on the transport&#13;
system. In particular, since more than 55% of the Polish foreign trade (in tons) already goes through&#13;
the Polish ports--which is foreseen to reach 65% in 2005--, the effectiveness of the port sector, and the&#13;
reliability and efficiency of its connections with other land transport networks, will clearly be prominent&#13;
factors in fostering the national economic development in the years ahead.&#13;
C. Transport Sector Administration&#13;
1.8          The Ministry of Transport and Maritime Economy (MTME) has overall responsibility&#13;
for the transport sector within the government structure. The Ministry's responsibility covers road, rail,&#13;
air and maritime transport and infrastructure, plus some related activities such as a few minor shipyards&#13;
located within the port areas. The legal arrangements and actual operating arrangements between the&#13;
Ministry and its dependent entities vary, covering the full range from purely administrative units such as&#13;
the General Directorate of Public Roads (GDDP) to enterprises in which the Government retains&#13;
control. In recognition of the importance of separation of the functions of policy setting, ownership&#13;
and operations management, some of those enterprises, including the three main port authorities, were&#13;
transformed in joint-stock companies in 1992, the shares of which are fully owned by the Ministry of&#13;
Ownership Transformation pending their expected total or partial sale to external pubfic or private&#13;
investors. Annex 1 shows the administrative structure of the Polish transport sector.&#13;
1.9          MTME's main functions are: (i) policy formulation; (ii) elaboration of sectoral budgets;&#13;
(iii) allocation of budgetary funds and subsidies between subsectors and enterprises; (iv) overall&#13;
supervision of entities such as PKP, GDDP, and Port Authorities; as well as a variety of regulatory&#13;
activities, including safety regulations.&#13;
D. Sectoral Issues and Policies&#13;
1.10         The Transport Policy Paper issued by MTME in July 1994, and subsequently approved&#13;
by the Council of Ministers in the fall, spells out the priorities of the national transport policy. Among&#13;
those are clearly stated the requirements (i) to remove bottlenecks in the transport system, and (ii) to&#13;
achieve high economic, social and environmental effects, so as to strengthen the competitiveness of&#13;
Polish transport organizations, and hence of the national economy.&#13;
1.11         The main issues still confronting the transport sector can be listed as follows:&#13;
restructuring of state-owned transport organizations, level and employment structure, competition and&#13;
modernization.&#13;
Restructuring of State Owned Transport Organizations&#13;
1.12         The restructuring process has been underway for several years already, and many new&#13;
independent enterprises have been set up out of former large state monopoles. The Bank's First&#13;
Transport Project contributed to this process, in particular in the railways and roads sectors. One&#13;
common way of dealing with public companies has been a two-step approach, whereby (i) they were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
first converted into joint-stock companies, the shares of which being fully owned by the Ministry of&#13;
Ownership Transformation during a specified time period, and (ii) at the expiration of this transitory&#13;
phase, sold in part or in full to external investors. This has been applied to the Port Authorities&#13;
(para.2.10). The second step of this process has proven more difficult than the first one and reaching&#13;
agreement on the conditions under which investors will participate has required considerable time.&#13;
Level and Employment Structure&#13;
1.13         Present shortcomings of the Polish transport system include excessive employment&#13;
levels in some subsectors. Such a situation exists mainly in rail transport, but generally the branch&#13;
employment structure does not fit the functional requirements of a modem transport system.&#13;
Differences with the branch employment structure in the EU are highlighted in the foUlowing table:&#13;
Table 1.1&#13;
Employment Structure in Transport in Poland and in the EU in 1991 (%)&#13;
Subsector                              EU                          Poland&#13;
Railway Transport                          16.1                         51.4&#13;

Auxiliary Activities                       28.2                         14.1&#13;
Source: Transport Policy Paper, July 1994&#13;
This points to the need to lower considerably the employment level in rail transport, and to a lesser&#13;
extent in sea transport, whereas the employment share in auxiliary activities (freight forwarding,&#13;
shipping agencies, logistics) should significantly increase. Although this adjustment process is already&#13;
underway, much remains yet to be done.&#13;
Competition and Modernization&#13;
1.14         The Government's expressed aim, as reiterated in the Transport Policy Paper, is to&#13;
increase competition in the whole transport sector.  The restructuring of public enterprises, as&#13;
mentioned above, is one element of this strategy. Both GDDP and PKP previously procured goods&#13;
and services available from their subsidiary units without competition, but are now inviting bids from&#13;
these and other enterprises. In the port subsector, most operating units have been formally separated&#13;
from the Port Authorities, but real competition between port services providers is still very much in its&#13;
infancy.&#13;
1.15         The modernization of the transport system also requires a better coordination between&#13;
the different transport modes. Combined road-rail transport has already met with some success in&#13;
Poland, but the necessary physical facilities need upgrading, and the organizational arrangements are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
not yet optimal. The Bank's Roads Project has begun addressing these issues through a Pilot Program&#13;
under implementation. Combined transport can also include a better use of the waterway network,&#13;
which has badly suffered of neglect in maintenance in the past. An important step in improving the&#13;
development of efficient transport services would be to improve the physical connections between&#13;
different transport networks at critical transit points, among which the seaports of national importance&#13;
figure prominently.&#13;
E. Transport Investments&#13;
1.16         A significant shortcoming of the sector in recent years has been the low level of&#13;
investment, from both public and private sources, compared with the total domestic investments.&#13;
Indeed in 1992 the total national transport investments amounted to 4.4% of the total domestic&#13;
investments, even though the total transport assets accounted for 12.4% of the country's national&#13;
assets. Whereas in the EEC countries there are about US$0.09 of annual investment per tkm, there are&#13;
15 times less in Poland (US$0.006). The following table illustrates the share of transport investments&#13;
in Poland since 1986:&#13;

F. Bank Experience in the Sector&#13;
1.18       The Bank has been involved in the sector since the late 80's. The ongoing First Transport&#13;
Project (Loans 3193-PO and 3194-PO, US$4.8 and 145.0 millions respectively, Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
843 1-POL of April 5, 1991) and the Roads Project (Loan 3564-PO, US$150.0 million, Staff Appraisal&#13;
Report 11226-POL of February 11, 1993) aim to support the restructuring and modernization of the&#13;
railways and highways respectively as well as to improve the overall traffic safety and to develop&#13;
combined transports.  The two Projects are progressing well, with the First Transport Project now&#13;
close to completion. Policy reform and restructuring have been implemented faster than foreseen, and&#13;
disbursements are following the expected schedule.&#13;

II. THE PORT SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. Port Facilities&#13;
2.1          The Polish seashore comprises two maritime regions, the Eastern one centering&#13;
around Gdansk and Gdynia, and the Western one around Szczecin and Swinoujscie. The ports of&#13;
Gdansk, Gdynia, and Szczecin-Swinoujscie handle together over 95% of the Polish maritime&#13;
traffic (52 million tons in 1994), the remaining being shipped through a number of smaller ports&#13;
like Police, Stepnica, Kolobrzeg and Elblag. Generally speaking, although some of the port&#13;
facilities are near the end of their economic life, the two maritime regions have ample port&#13;
capacity to accommodate the traffic volumes forecasted up to 2005, as far as the overall&#13;
throughput is concerned. However, restructuring and modernization of existing facilities will be&#13;
necessary to accommodate changes in traffic patterns and structure--increase in ferry traffic, for&#13;
instance--and new functions such as value-added services.&#13;
2.2          Total present port throughput capacity, depending on the evolution of the traffic&#13;
structure between dry bulks, liquid bulks, and breakbulk/general cargo, stands between 70 and&#13;
80 million tons per year, which is potentially sufficient, as a whole, to cover traffic requirements&#13;
until 2005 (para.2.16). However, changes in the distribution of traffic flows, for instance from&#13;
export to import, may need significant conversion works of the corresponding facilities.&#13;
Similarly, the expected growth of general cargo, container and ferry traffic will demand&#13;
adjustments of the existing physical infrastructure. The various dedicated and common use port&#13;
facilities have potential capacity surpluses and shortfalls, which will have to be adjusted in order&#13;
to make the best economic use of the available assets.&#13;
2.3          Gdansk, with its North Port being the deepest of the Baltic Sea, can accommodate&#13;
ships up to 150,000 tdw and is the best equipped facility for dry and liquid bulk cargo handling,&#13;
with ample space available to cater for future developments (see IBRD Map 27439). Gdynia,&#13;
apart from its smaller scale bulk facilities and its general cargo areas, is equipped with a modern&#13;
container terminal, the Baltic Container Terminal, which started operations in 1979 and is the&#13;
only genuine container port in Poland (see IBRD Map 27438). Szczecin operates a mix of&#13;
breakbulk and bulk facilities, most of them being rather old and in a great need of repair (see&#13;
IBRD Map 27436). Swinoujscie is basically designed as a drybulk port, but is now diversifying&#13;
into breakbulk cargoes in addition to its industrial role (see IBRD Map 27437). Swinoujscie,&#13;
Gdynia, and Gdansk operate ferry and roll-on/roll-off terminals, the two former being by far the&#13;
most significant. A summary of port physical facilities is given in Annex 2.&#13;
2.4          Hinterland connections are in a poor state, in particular the road accesses, and&#13;
consequently severely hamper port throughput efficiency. The marked shift already underway&#13;
from rail to road for inland transport compounds this situation, which may jeopardize the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
efficiency gains realized within the ports, in particular for time-sensitive flows such as ferry and&#13;
container traffic. The proposed Project will concentrate on this aspect (paras.2.27 and 3.3).&#13;
B. Administrative Framework&#13;
2.5          From the end of the Second World War the main Polish ports have been managed&#13;
by dedicated State Companies. The ports of Szczecin and Swinoujscie have been managed as&#13;
one single company to date, whereas the ports of Gdansk and Gdynia after having been managed&#13;
by one port authority until 1954, have since then been managed separately.  These port&#13;
companies were acting as executive branches of the Ministry of Transport.&#13;
2.6          Nautical and maritime tasks, including navigation safety and maritime accesses&#13;
maintenance, have been executed by Urzad Morski (Maritime Bureau) in Gdynia, Szczecin, and&#13;
Slupsk, subordinated directly to the Minister of Transport and Maritime Economy.&#13;
2.7          The port ownership and management structure was thus strictly centralized.&#13;
Moreover, the major ports also acted as home bases for Polish Ocean Lines, and other state&#13;
owned shipping companies.  All seaborne transports were also centrally planned.  As a&#13;
consequence, Polish ports possessed a monopolistic position with regard to Polish foreign trade.&#13;
They operated mainly on behalf of the national economy and as transit points for cargoes from&#13;
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, within the COMECON framework.&#13;
2.8          The transportation of goods via Polish ports to and from the hinterland was&#13;
mainly done by train.  There was therefore no compelling reason to develop the road&#13;
infrastructure near the ports and in the port cities. As the majority of Polish waterways were&#13;
neglected and few are navigable, inland water transport has not been developed on a large scale.&#13;
Train transport was, and for bulk commodities still is, the major land carrier of seaborne freight&#13;
to and from inland destinations. The poor state of the road network leading to the ports is partly&#13;
a consequence of this situation.&#13;
2.9          Moreover, relations between port cities and their ports were weak. This, and the&#13;
domination of rail transport, resulted in a situation where ports and cities developed largely in&#13;
isolation. This situation is again reflected in the many poor and badly maintained access roads to&#13;
the various ports. This is therefore the reason why the Project proposes to focus on the port&#13;
road access aspect as a matter of priority.&#13;
Present Legal Framework&#13;
2.10         In order to separate policy setting, ownership and management functions in a&#13;
market economy, the state port enterprises were transformed between May and November 1992&#13;
into Joint Stock Companies of the State Treasury. The main legal basis for such a status can be&#13;
found in the Law on Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises, dated July 13, 1990. The State,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
represented by the Treasury, is the legal owner of 100% of the capital of the Port Authorities&#13;
Companies, with the formal rights with regard to the use of capital and assets devolved to the&#13;
Ministry of Ownership Transformation. In a later phase, the law provides for the transfer of&#13;
shares of the joint stock companies into the hands of their final shareholders, the nature of whom&#13;
has to be defined in the new Ports Law to be enacted (para.2. 12).&#13;
2.11         During 1991 three Joint Stock Companies were established:&#13;
Port Authority of Szczecin-Swinoujscie, with a total staff of 5,000;&#13;
Port Authority of Gdynia, with a total staff of 6,700;&#13;
Port Authority of Gdansk, with a total staff of 4,000.&#13;
In this new structure the port enterprises became increasingly independent from the central&#13;
government. They gradually moved from operating companies under the direction of MTME to&#13;
full-scale port authorities provisionally linked to the Ministry of Ownership Transformation. In&#13;
the meantime they began separating the operating units from the management bodies, with the&#13;
intention to set up private commercial operating companies (paras.2. 17/24).&#13;
2.12         Providing the sector with a definitive official legal framework is a central issue.&#13;
The new Ports Law has been under preparation since 1991, and a final draft, in line with the&#13;
Bank's strategy in the sector, has been discussed between the various ministries involved for&#13;
more than a year, before being officially approved by the Council of Ministers on October 17,&#13;
1995. It now has to be approved by Parliament, where it is expected to be passed without major&#13;
difficulties, which should take place within three to four months. The preparation of the Project&#13;
contributed to the ideas and thinking behind the draft law. As a result of the draft law&#13;
discussions, both MTME and the Port Authorities have already started behaving in the spirit of&#13;
the law, therefore beginning to dispel the uncertainty as to legal and regulatory aspects, which&#13;
clearly was hampering further sector development.&#13;
2.13         The main thrust of the draft Ports Law is to provide for the new Port Authorities&#13;
to act as "landlords", in charge of managing the public infrastructure assets, while the port&#13;
commercial activities would be carried out by separate private operators, fully independent from&#13;
the Port Authorities. This concept, which is now broadly accepted among the port community,&#13;
appears as the most adequate arrangement. It must be complemented by a clear definition of the&#13;
regulating role to be played by MTME, which according to the draft law, will formally recover&#13;
its monitoring function over the sector as a whole, and will represent the State Treasury in the&#13;
Port Joint Stock Companies. The technical assistance component of the proposed Project will&#13;
provide help to work out practical implementation arrangements and regulations once the Ports&#13;
Law is passed (para.3.21). The principles of the proposed law are widely accepted and the&#13;
Polish authorities are preparing for their implementation. However, even in case of unforeseen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
delays with the new law the proposed Project will contribute to meaningful and high return&#13;
developments of port activities. It should also be noted that Polish ports already operate in an&#13;
international competitive context. In addition, domestic competition between ports in Poland is&#13;
significant.&#13;
Overall Sector Organization&#13;
2.14        The future organization of the sector will therefore consist of:&#13;
MTME, in charge of overall sector monitoring and regulation, through two&#13;
specific departments: the Department of Shipping and Seaports, directly&#13;
responsible for supervision of the Ports Authorities and assessment of their&#13;
development programs; and the Department of Sea and Inland Waterway&#13;
Administration, responsible for navigation safety through the Maritime Offices,&#13;
and for legal management of the port public assets;&#13;
the Port Authorities, in charge of the management of port infrastructure facilities,&#13;
and of the strategic development planning;&#13;
the private operating companies, in charge of all commercial operations in the&#13;
port areas.&#13;
C. Traffic&#13;
2.15        The port sector has been affected by many of the same forces that have influenced&#13;
the economy in general. With respect to physical throughput there has been a substantial&#13;
decline. Between 1980 and 1991 traffic has been reduced from 66 mt to 44 mt with imports cut&#13;
in half but exports only marginally reduced. The 1993 traffic recovered to above 48 mt, an&#13;
order of magnitude maintained in 1994 with about 52 mt. Gdynia, Gdansk and Szczecin handle&#13;
most of the breakbulk cargoes moving through Polish ports. Gdynia dominates the container&#13;
traffic, while the bulk trades are shared predominantly between Gdansk and Swinoujscie, Gdynia&#13;
and Szczecin handling a more limited, although significant, proportion. A summary of 1994 port&#13;
traffic for the three main ports is presented in Annex 3.&#13;
2.16        The forecasts available today, elaborated on the basis of anticipated domestic&#13;
economic growth and commodities market analysis, amended to take into account the possible&#13;
traffic diversion by other modes of land transport to and from neighboring countries, point to&#13;
around 62 mt of total port traffic for 2000, and around 78 mt for 2005. The commodities&#13;
expected to have important growth are general cargo, container and ferry traffic, with the overall&#13;
general cargo flows more than doubling between now and 2005. The container traffic, in&#13;
particular, is slated to register the most impressive growth, increasing by about 200% over the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
period, while the ferry traffic would follow with a 130% growth rate. Global traffic forecasts&#13;
are presented in Annex .&#13;
D. Port Organization&#13;
2.17        Within the relative legal vacuum created de facto since the formal transfer of the&#13;
administrative ownership of ports to the Ministry of Ownership Transformation and the&#13;
preparation of the new Ports Law, the ports themselves started to privatize parts of their&#13;
operations. In doing so, all three major ports developed different policies.&#13;
2.18        The Port of Gdansk, simultaneously with its establishment as a Joint-Stock&#13;
Company, formed 28 limited liability companies out of former departments of the port&#13;
enterprise. As a first stage, the Port Authority kept 45% of the shares of these companies, the&#13;
other 55% being owned by the workers. In a second step, in 1993 the Port Authority transferred&#13;
its 45% share to the individual companies, now consequently 100% employee-owned. The&#13;
operating companies own mostly light handling equipment and vehicles, whereas the&#13;
superstructure located on their dedicated areas is rented out by the Port Authority. These&#13;
companies employ a total of some 2,200 staff.&#13;
2.19        As a result of this transformation process, the Port Authority is now a smaller&#13;
organization with limited tasks, all commercial activities being left to the operating companies.&#13;
The Port Authority of Gdansk employs 400 people, and is responsible for infrastructure&#13;
development and maintenance, managing the lease and renting agreements with the operating&#13;
companies, and providing them with basic utilities services.&#13;
2.20        Although this is formally a genuine privatization process, the result in the field is&#13;
still remote from what should be expected from private commercial port operations, in particular&#13;
as far as competition is concerned. All stevedoring companies, for instance, work under the&#13;
umbrella of the Commercial Sea Port of Gdansk, an additional private company belonging to the&#13;
port workers (80%) and the companies themselves (20%). This umbrella company actually does&#13;
all the marketing for the stevedoring companies, based on a common tariff policy, and distributes&#13;
the work to keep everyone busy, which is nothing but a new monopoly situation, in fact a&#13;
workers monopoly. Furthermore, as a consequence of the way they were established, these&#13;
operating companies are generally greatly undercapitalized, unable to maintain and develop their&#13;
asset base, and it is likely that many would collapse if put in the midst of a true commercial&#13;
competition.&#13;
2.21        The Port of Gdynia took a cautious approach towards the privatization of its&#13;
operational activities. It has for some time been operating within the organizational framework&#13;
of the original state enterprise, while preparing for progressive divestiture of commercial&#13;
operations.  As a first step, seven entities were earmarked for separation from the Port&#13;
Authority, and internally restructured, shedding in the process about 2,000 jobs. In a second&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
move, two operational entities were hived off into independent companies in 1994, the Baltic&#13;
Container Terminal and the Baltic Grain Terminal. Two more are slated to follow in 1995. The&#13;
port and the independent companies together employ 4,700 staff.&#13;
2.22        For the time being, these companies are still fully owned by the Port of Gdynia,&#13;
but with the objective to open up their shareholding structure to allow local and foreign private&#13;
investors to take equity stakes, and finally to control the companies. This is a requirement of the&#13;
new Port Law, which will state that the Port Authorities should not have any commercial interest&#13;
in the operating companies.&#13;
2.23        The Port of Szczecin-Swinoujscie, when established as a Joint-Stock Company,&#13;
formed 17 limited liability companies out of former departments of the port enterprise, as did the&#13;
Port of Gdansk (16 remain now, following a merger). The Port Authority has kept 45% of the&#13;
shares of these companies, the other 55% being owned by the workers. All fixed assets,&#13;
including equipment, are still owned by the Port Authority, which leases them to the operating&#13;
companies. Moreover, the Port Authority has a decisive say in the companies' tariff policy,&#13;
negotiates the contracts with customers on behalf of the companies, and coordinates the&#13;
distribution of work between the different companies. These companies employ around 3,800&#13;
staff, and the Port Authority about 500.&#13;
2.24        Clearly, this process stops short of any genuine privatization or commercialization&#13;
of operations in a competitive market situation. To comply with the new Ports Law soon to be&#13;
enacted, the Port Authority will have to withdraw from the operating companies. But their&#13;
present condition, with regard to finances, marketing, restructuring and management skills,&#13;
would prevent most of them from surviving without the support of the port administration, which&#13;
is actually managing them. Thus a process of further restructuring has to be foreseen.&#13;
E. Port Planning and Investment Program&#13;
2.25        The Transport Policy Paper spells out the priorities for the maritime transport&#13;
subsector, which as far as the ports are concerned, are as follows:&#13;
(a)   improve the competitiveness of Polish ports and shipping services;&#13;
(b)   develop ferry connections between Polish ports and ports around the Baltic&#13;
sea;&#13;
(c)   ensure greater navigation safety and ecological protection of the coastal&#13;
environment.&#13;
Apart from upgrading the technical capacity of the ports, the policy will also aim at completing&#13;
the institutional reform process, to achieve complete separation between port ownership,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
management and commercial operations, to end monopoly situations, and to support the&#13;
development of multimodal transport technologies.&#13;
2.26          Consequently, and taking into account the significant potential reserve of capacity&#13;
already in place, investments in ports should serve to upgrade and modernize the services&#13;
provided, while refraining from increasing the global throughput potential. This potential,&#13;
however, must be adjusted to cope with the changes in foreign trade and traffic structures and&#13;
patterns. In doing so, priority must be given to investments towards improvement in unitized&#13;
cargoes' handling and transit, development of logistics services, and activation of efficient sea-&#13;
land combined transport operations.&#13;
2.27         The proposed Project will address these priority issues.  In improving road&#13;
accesses to the ports, it will contribute to enhance the service offered to unitized cargoes like&#13;
containers and goods shipped on ro-ro and ferry carriers. It will contribute to improve safety of&#13;
navigation in implementing a vessel traffic management system between Szczecin and&#13;
Swinoujscie, and to safety of road transport by diverting heavy trucks away from city centers to&#13;
better direct connections between ports and inland transport networks.&#13;
F. Port Finance and Cost Recovery&#13;
2.28         Before the economic reform  process was launched, the central government&#13;
decided, directly or indirectly, on the most important financial aspects in port management:&#13;
investments, tariffs, cargo allocation, costs of production factors. The combination of centrally&#13;
determined tariffs and cargo allocation implied that the ports had no influence over the volume of&#13;
cargo they handled, and therefore could not influence their total revenues by using competitive&#13;
pricing. Moreover, as the cost of production was by and large determined by the central&#13;
government there was little room left for the ports themselves to manage their financial&#13;
performance.&#13;
2.29         Today the ports are formally joint-stock companies under the supervision of the&#13;
government, but it is not clear how far the monitoring tasks to be logically performed by MTME&#13;
are actually carried out, in particular as investments and tariffs are concerned. The situation&#13;
should become clearer when the new Ports Law, which includes provisions on the relationships&#13;
between the ministry and the ports on these matters, is finally enacted. In addition, the role of&#13;
the central government with respect to cargo allocation and costs has now practically ended. The&#13;
cargo is allocated between ports on a commercial basis, and the costs are market related, with the&#13;
result that the financial performance of the ports is now to a large extent determined by their&#13;
management.&#13;
2.30         Although the profits of the port sector are reportedly lower than in the seventies,&#13;
positive results are still made. Compared with the former situation the share of the gross profit&#13;
that the central government takes has decreased: the income tax presently stands at 40%, instead&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
of 60% in the past, and ports pay a dividend, halved in 1993, which actually has more a&#13;
character of interest than of dividend, being linked to a percentage of the share capital and not to&#13;
the performance of the company.  However, under the present tax and dividend rules a&#13;
significant part of the gross profit--between 50 and 70% depending on ports--is still paid to the&#13;
government.&#13;
Port Revenues&#13;
2.31         Port revenues consist of charges for services in the areas of navigation, use of&#13;
berths and cargo and passenger operations. Services for navigation include conservancy, port&#13;
accesses, safety, and specific services such as pilotage, towage, and mooring/unmooring. Berth&#13;
related charges relate to berth occupation, and various ancillary services to the ship. Cargo and&#13;
passengers services include the various components of cargo handling, storage and equipment&#13;
utilization. The Port Authorities of Gdansk and Szczecin-Swinoujscie have transferred part of&#13;
these functions to separate operating companies, and therefore receive rental revenues for the&#13;
infrastructure, superstructure and equipment rented and fees for some administrative services.&#13;
Financial Position of the Port Authorities&#13;
2.32         The financial statements for the three main Port Authorities of Gdansk, Gdynia&#13;
and Szczecin-Swinoujscie for the years 1992, 1993, 1994 and the first six months of 1995&#13;
together with a review of their financial performance are shown in Annex 5. During this period&#13;
inflation was running at over 30% per annum, significant restructuring of the authorities was&#13;
undertaken and changes in accounting principles were introduced. In the circumstances, caution&#13;
must be used interpreting the results. Part of the effect of inflation was offset through the&#13;
revaluation of fixed assets. In spite of these limiting factors, however, it is felt that the accounts&#13;
provide reasonable guidelines on the financial results during the three and a half year period&#13;
ending June 30, 1995. All three authorities were established as joint stock companies with the&#13;
National Treasury holding all the shares. All three have established associated or "daughter"&#13;
companies to operate the port and so the major part of their revenue comes in the form of rent&#13;
for the leasing of the port infrastructure to the operating companies.&#13;
2.33         The authorities achieved operating ratios of 60/70% during the three years 1992-&#13;
1994. During the first six months of 1995, however, the operating ratios ranged from 82% for&#13;
Gdansk to 87% for Gdynia. A fall in traffic, mainly transit traffic, at all three ports, together&#13;
with an erosion of tariffs caused by the devaluation of the US dollar, was the main cause for this&#13;
increase. Another contributing factor was an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation.&#13;
The rise in operating costs in 1995 was moderated to some extent by a reduction in the level of&#13;
depreciation charged. Some reduction in depreciation rates are justified with the transfer of&#13;
equipment to the daughter companies. The average rate of return on net fixed assets for the&#13;
three years 1992 through 1994 ranged from about 11 % for Gdynia to 16% for Szczecin. The&#13;
rate fell substantially for all three authorities for the first six months of 1995 to an average of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
about 5 %.  The reduction resulted from  the fall in profitability coupled with a substantial&#13;
revaluation of net fixed assets.&#13;
2.34         The level of investment during the three and a half year period was in line with&#13;
the level of depreciation charged by Gdansk and Gdynia and about 50% higher in the case of&#13;
Szczecin. Internal cash generation provided the authorities with sufficient funds to meet their&#13;
increased requirement for working capital, to finance all investment and to pay a substantial sum&#13;
in tax on their profits. The Authorities do not have major problems in collecting receivables.&#13;
2.35         During the period under review there was a substantial increase in the nominal&#13;
value of the Authorities' net fixed assets but this was mainly due to revaluation. The Authorities&#13;
have no long-term debt. The Government has a very substantial equity investment in the three&#13;
Authorities totaling old ZL 11,435 billion.&#13;
2.36         The trading results for the three years 1992-1994 were satisfactory, but a&#13;
significant decline took place during the first six months of 1995 (para.2.33).  The present&#13;
financial positions of the three Authorities are very strong with all their financing provided by&#13;
equity investment.  The Authorities are in a position to finance major capital investment&#13;
programs from  their own resources and to supplement these with substantial borrowing, if&#13;
required. A Government guarantee may be required at present due to conditions in the local&#13;
financial market and for country reasons for foreign borrowing. The Authorities should be in a&#13;
position to meet the debt service obligations on borrowing together with a guarantee fee.&#13;
2.37         In the existing context, the overall financial management of the port authorities&#13;
can be considered satisfactory. The national exchange rate management principles, together with&#13;
the effects of domestic inflation, may affect the profitability of the ports and require tariffs&#13;
adjustments to keep up with operating costs. But the ports operate in a competitive environment&#13;
in international transport, and have therefore to improve their competitiveness to keep their share&#13;
of the market. The proposed Project will precisely help increase the ports competitiveness and&#13;
improve their management capacity. The second operation, the Port Modernization Project, will&#13;
address more specifically the issue of the ports' tariff policy and internal financial management.&#13;
Cost Recovery&#13;
2.38         The analysis of the financial accounts of the Port Authorities shows that overall&#13;
cost recovery seems satisfactory, even if the present transitory situation may blur somewhat the&#13;
situation, in particular as far as the use of national budgetary resources is concerned, as for&#13;
dredging activities. The clear separation of the Port Authorities from any commercial activities,&#13;
as provided for in the new PRrts l,aw, will undoubtedly help clarify the financial picture.&#13;
2.39         As far as the Project investments are concerned, however, the situation is much&#13;
clearer. The road and bridge components, which make up to 78% of the total cost of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Project, will be handled by the General Administration of Public Roads (GDDP), which is in&#13;
charge of managing the public roads of the country. The cost recovery from road users, through&#13;
various taxes associated with road use, amounts to more than twice the amount spent for the road&#13;
sector in Poland. Although taxes, especially fuel taxes, as well as expenditures on roads, will&#13;
have to be raised in order to (i) harmonize the tax levels with Western Europe and (ii)&#13;
accommodate the rapidly growing road traffic, the present cost recovery is deemed satisfactoiy&#13;
and acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
3.1          The objective of the overall port sector modernization program is to contribute to&#13;
the development of an efficient administrative/managerial structure and improvement of physical&#13;
facilities in the ports of Gdansk, Gdynia, and Szczecin-Swinoujscie, so that they will provide&#13;
efficient services in competition with other ports serving their potential hinterlands. Due to the&#13;
still ongoing process of establishing a new legal framework for the port authorities, a two-stage&#13;
approach has been developed: a first Project, the present Port Access and Management Project,&#13;
includes the components which are of top priority for the overall modernization program and&#13;
prerequisites for further modernization and improvements, but mostly outside the port&#13;
authorities' direct jurisdiction, whereas a second Project, the Port Modernization Project, would&#13;
include the components under the direct management of the port authorities, such as&#13;
rehabilitation of physical facilities, ship waste collection and treatment facilities, etc. Moreover,&#13;
the preparation of the tentative components of the possible second Project being less advanced&#13;
than those identified for the first one, the overall Project sequence will allow the preparatory&#13;
works to go on for the second Project, while the most pressing issues will be addressed through&#13;
the first one. It is also expected that the enactment of a new Port Bill in the meantime will have&#13;
set the stage for effective dealings with the port authorities.&#13;
3.2          The Project would fit within the Country Assistance Strategy defined in the CAS&#13;
report dated October 20, 1994, as a medium-sized transport infrastructure Project aiming at&#13;
bridging some missing links in basic infrastructure facilities, and which would be limited to&#13;
investments not likely to attract private financing (CAS para.41), while helping setting the stage&#13;
for further private sector participation in port operations.&#13;
3.3          The objectives of the proposed Project are therefore to improve:&#13;
physical access to the ports; and&#13;
management capacity in the ports of Gdansk, Gdynia, and Szczecin-&#13;
Swinoujscie.&#13;
Achieving these objectives will strengthen the ports' capacity to provide efficient services and to&#13;
connect more effectively with domestic inland transport networks, thus enhancing the&#13;
competitiveness of the whole transport chain. In addition, the Project would assist the Borrower,&#13;
through technical assistance and training, in implementing the new institutional set-up now being&#13;
devised for the port sector. In view of the present overcapacity and the unclear future situation&#13;
of ports in the Baltic and their hinterlands, the two Projects will focus on clearly identified needs&#13;
for the Polish ports and would thus not contribute to a general port overcapacity in the Baltic Sea&#13;
region.&#13;
&#13;

B. Project Description&#13;
3.4         There would be two main aspects: a Policy and Institutional Component and an&#13;
Investment Component. These are summarized below and described in more details in the&#13;
following paragraphs.&#13;
Description Summary&#13;
(a)   Policy and Institutions: the Project would support measures to adjust the&#13;
relationship between government, local government, port authority and the&#13;
private sector through adequate legislation. The concept would be based&#13;
on the emerging structures as outlined in para.2.14 above.  The Port&#13;
Authorities would have essentially a landlord function and be owned by a&#13;
combination of government, municipal and private entities. The port&#13;
operating companies should be commercial enterprises, contributing to the&#13;
decisions of the Port Authority but not controlled by it. Development of&#13;
the Port Authorities will be supported through technical assistance and&#13;
training.  Increased competition between private enterprises in the&#13;
stevedoring, warehousing and other port services is foreseen.&#13;
(b)   Investments: the Project would include:&#13;
(i)   construction of the Martwa Wisla access bridge to the Gdansk&#13;
North-East Port;&#13;
(ii)   protection of the Wisla Smiala outlet in Gdansk;&#13;
(iii)  construction of the new Regalica and Parnica bridges allowing&#13;
access to Szczecin central port area;&#13;
(iv)  improvement of the road connection between Swinoujscie and&#13;
Szczecin through Wolin;&#13;
(v)   first phase modernization of the Szczecin-Swinoujscie fairway&#13;
through implementation of a vessel traffic management system.&#13;
The most crucial access problem for the port of Gdynia, duly acknowledged during Project&#13;
identification--the completion of the Kwiatkowski road improving access to the container&#13;
terminal--is already included in the ongoing Road Project.&#13;
Road Access to the Gdansk North Port&#13;
3.5         The Port of Gdansk is divided into three sections: (i) the West or old port,&#13;
separated from the two other areas by the Vistula river; (ii) the East Port, mainly in use for the&#13;
transfer of miscellaneous bulk commodities; and (iii) the North Port, comprising the largest bulk&#13;
cargo terminals of Poland, handling also breakbulk and general cargo. The North Port, located&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
on the Stogi island, is by far the most important section, representing 95% of the cargo handled&#13;
in Gdansk in 1994. It is specialized in dry and liquid bulk cargoes, the main commnodities being&#13;
oil products, coal, sulphur and phosphates.  Grain, timber and general cargo are also&#13;
loaded/unloaded in the North Port.&#13;
3.6         The North Port is presently connected to the main highway network (E-77)&#13;
through the Sucharskiego road and the Siennicka bridge across the Vistula river.  This&#13;
connection which actually consists of city streets has poor traffic conditions due to its character&#13;
and sharp bends and three low rail viaducts. The Project would create an alternative connection&#13;
between the port areas and the E-77. Furthermore, in the light of the port-related development&#13;
Projects located on the Stogi island, upgrading the road connection between the island and the&#13;
mainland is a prerequisite for any further development of the whole area, which is earmarked as&#13;
the main land reserve for city and port development. Also, the implementation of this new&#13;
access road will be the first stage of a broader operation, later allowing the Stogi island to be&#13;
directly connected to the Gdansk-Gdynia ringroad.&#13;
3.7         The proposed Project includes (i) construction of an access road to the new bridge&#13;
location; (ii) construction of a 140 m bridge over the Martwa Wisla (Dead Vistula) river; and&#13;
(iii) road connection between the bridge and the E-77 via an embankment (see IBRD Map&#13;
27439).&#13;
Wisla Smiala Outlet Protection&#13;
3.8          The Wisla Smiala river joins the Baltic Sea through the East and West&#13;
breakwaters. However, due to natural phenomena combined with poor maintenance over the&#13;
past years, the breakwaters have ceased to function as such and have turned into massive and&#13;
irregular heaps of stones. The situation is further worsened by the significant deposits of silt and&#13;
sand carried by the tide and the river waters. The river bed is now heavily silted. The overall&#13;
present condition of the outlet has therefore become a real threat to the safety of population,&#13;
property and industry situated in the catchment zone of the river, since large areas could be&#13;
inundated during river flooding, the natural water discharge into the sea being more or less&#13;
physically blocked.&#13;
3.9         In view of the above, the Maritime Bureau (Urzad Morski) decided to rebuild the&#13;
breakwaters, and to carry out some related marine works to reopen the river outlet for&#13;
navigation. Accordingly, the proposed Project would consist of (i) reconstruction of the East and&#13;
West breakwaters and of the related shore protection; (ii) dredging works in the river's mouth to&#13;
recover the former depth of around 4 m required to allow for effective flood prevention; and (iii)&#13;
supply and installation of related navigation aids.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
Road Access to Szczecin Central Port Area&#13;
3.10         The port of Szczecin is located in the river delta between the West and East Odra.&#13;
Since the port, as well as other main Polish ports, was constructed mainly as a rail port, its road&#13;
connections are grossly inadequate. Moreover, the existing access roads are in poor conditions.&#13;
Further development and the introduction of modem port functions are essentially dependent&#13;
upon the improvement of the access to the port area from the main highway system.&#13;
3.11         The port area is surrounded by rivers. The access to the port on the west side&#13;
runs directly into the center of the city, whereas the eastern outlet crosses the Regalica river&#13;
(East Odra) via a low capacity connection, using an old and dilapidated bridge. The main road&#13;
system connecting Szczecin to other destinations in Poland, as well as to the Berlin area, lies to&#13;
the east of the city (E-65, SR-10, E-28). Apart from these limitations, the access road system is&#13;
further characterized by narrow road width, and small horizontal radii causing traffic hazards, in&#13;
particular for long vehicles (see IBRD Map 27436).&#13;
3.12         The Project consists of two parts: (i) the construction of a new 560 m bridge over&#13;
the Regalica river, with the related access roads and connections; and (ii) a fly-over between&#13;
Gdanska street and the port central area, over the Parnica river, with the related connections to&#13;
the existing road system. Although the Parnica bridge sub-component is less advanced as far as&#13;
the final design is concerned, it is proposed to keep the option to include it in the Project, for its&#13;
contribution to the improvement of port access is critical for the port to take full advantage of the&#13;
new Regalica bridge. In any case, the implementation schedule of the Parnica sub-component&#13;
would have to follow the Regalica bridge schedule with at least a one-year gap, which allows for&#13;
all parameters to be finalized in due time.&#13;
Improvement of the Road Connection between Swinoujscie and Szczecin through Wolin&#13;
3.13         The E-65, road originating in Swinoujscie, is the main traffic North-South&#13;
connection in western Poland. The Wolin road constitutes its northernmost element, connecting&#13;
the city and port facilities of Swinoujscie with the Szczecin ring road. The E-65 is an important&#13;
element in the trans-European road system, (i) internationally, as a transit route for traffic from&#13;
Scandinavia towards the Adriatic Sea and the Balkans, and (ii) domestically, as the main&#13;
connection between the western Polish ports of Szczecin and Swinoujscie, and the main industrial&#13;
centers located in the south of the country. The E-65 begins in the eastern district of Swinoujscie&#13;
town, with the ferry terminal as its starting point. It is the only road link between Swinoujscie&#13;
and the rest of Poland (see IBRD Map 27440).&#13;
3.14         The main constraints impeding traffic on the Wolin road consist of: (i) the low&#13;
level turning bridge over the Dwina river in Wolin town, with a width of only 6 m and frequent&#13;
openings; (ii) the passage through the town of Wolin, with its narrow streets and bends; (iii) the&#13;
passage through the Dargobadz village, with sharp turns and narrow width; and (iv) a 6.3 km&#13;
stretch through the Wolin National Park, with limited width and narrow bends.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
3.15         In order to adapt the road to modem  traffic requirements and improve&#13;
environment and safety aspects of existing infrastructure, these bottlenecks should be eliminated.&#13;
The proposed Project therefore includes: (i) a by-pass of the village of Dargobadz; and (ii) the&#13;
modernization of the road section through the Wolin National Park.  Due to obvious&#13;
environmental reasons, a compromise design for this latter component was worked out so as to&#13;
minimize the potential consequences on the National Park.  Additional elements of the&#13;
improvement program, including a new bridge over the Dwina river east of Wolin, and a by-pass&#13;
of the town of Wolin, were initially also contemplated, but were finally dropped because of their&#13;
insufficient economic justification.&#13;
3.16         When reviewing the possibilities to upgrade the road section through the Wolin&#13;
National Park, alternative options were considered. The most attractive one was to design a new&#13;
road running north of the existing one, roughly parallel to the existing railway line. However,&#13;
apart from the sheer cost factor, this option had to be dismissed on environmental grounds (see&#13;
para.3.41). Consequently, the limited modernization of the existing section is the preferred&#13;
solution.&#13;
First Phase Modernization of the Szczecin-Swinoujscie Fairway:&#13;
Implementation of a Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS)&#13;
3.17         The port of Szczecin is situated at the estuary of the Odra river, 65 km from the&#13;
port of Swinoujscie and the open sea. Szczecin port facilities can accommodate ships up to 210&#13;
m long. The fairway from Swinoujscie to Szczecin consists of several dredged channel sections&#13;
with a design depth of 10.5 m and a maximum width of 100 m. The port of Swinoujscie,&#13;
managed together with Szczecin under a single port authority, is located at the mouth of the river&#13;
on the Wolin island. The two other ports locations of Police and Stepnica, established along the&#13;
fairway, are operating under the control of the Szczecin Maritime Office, which monitors the&#13;
navigation in the fairway, but are not managed by the Szczecin-Swinoujscie port authority.&#13;
3.18         Today the navigation in the fairway is difficult because of a series of&#13;
impediments. These include: (i) dangerous bends between the Swinoujscie breakwaters at the&#13;
fairway's entrance, and at three more locations in the fairway; (ii) badly protected banks in the&#13;
narrow stretches of the fairway, forcing vessels to pass at very low speed to avoid further&#13;
degradation; (iii) inadequate channel width and depth in several locations; (iv) missing&#13;
breakwater at the South entrance of the Piastowski canal; (v) lack of required navigation aids and&#13;
beacons; and (vi) no vessel traffic management system available along the fairway. As a&#13;
consequence of this situation, the entire fairway is in fact a one-way-traffic channel, resulting in&#13;
considerable time losses in passing through. Furthermore, ships beyond 176 m are only allowed&#13;
to sail through the fairway during day-time, because of the lack of safety monitoring system,&#13;
which causes significant additional downtime to most ships calling at Szczecin (see IBRD Map&#13;
27440).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
3.19        The fairway modernization program therefore consists of two parts: physical&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading, and improvement of traffic management capacity. The proposed&#13;
Project will address the latter, while the former, which includes mainly civil works and&#13;
dredging, would be part of the second operation tentatively defined as the Port Modernization&#13;
Project. The rationale behind this split is that while the need to improve the safety monitoring&#13;
capacity should be addressed quickly, the physical works under consideration require a more&#13;
detailed feasibility analysis, including a dedicated environmental assessment. These analyses and&#13;
assessments are being carried out in the meantime, and results are expected to be available by&#13;
mid-1996.&#13;
3.20        The vast majority of ports of international significance have introduced a Vessel&#13;
Traffic Management System (VTMS) within their operational tools. A VTMS is a combination&#13;
of radar and real-time communications links, complemented by a processing software allowirg&#13;
the port or the maritime authority to constantly visualize and monitor the traffic situation, by&#13;
providing it with real-time indicators and a capacity to anticipate and avert hazardous traffic&#13;
configurations. A VTMS will also help enforcing navigation rules by detecting and alerting the&#13;
monitoring authority in case of breach by an incoming ship in the area covered by the system. In&#13;
the case of Szczecin, an additional benefit will be that improved vessel traffic management will&#13;
have a bearing on the efficient use of the fairway and might possibly ease dredging requirements.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
3.21        This component will provide for institutional advice and training in the field of&#13;
regulation of port activities, management and maintenance of public assets, and divestiture of&#13;
commercial activities to the private sector. More specifically, it will include assistance to the&#13;
Polish Administration in working out the practical implementation arrangements and related&#13;
regulations once the Ports Law would have been passed. Terms of Reference for this task are&#13;
presented in Annex 6. Training needs for the central ministerial units as well as for the ports'&#13;
management teams will be assessed following the finalization of the provisions of the new Ports&#13;
Law, taking into account the need to translate the new institutional framework into practical&#13;
working relationships between the different units involved. The training program framework&#13;
is shown in Annex 7 and, together with the Terms of Reference for the Technical&#13;
Assistance, has been formally agreed upon at negotiations (para.5.2.(ii)).&#13;
C. Design and Engineering&#13;
3.22        Overall Project management will be coordinated, under the umbrella of the&#13;
Shipping and Seaports Department of MTME, by GDDP for the roads and bridges components,&#13;
by Urzad Morski for the maritime components, and by the Port Authorities for the management&#13;
information component. Project design for the investment components has been carried out by&#13;
consultants funded by the Netherlands Trust Fund for Eastern and Central Europe, in&#13;
collaboration with Polish consultants, GDDP, Urzad Morski, and the Ports Authorities. Western&#13;
European and Polish standards were being used, the two being very close. Detailed design&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
engineering is being carried out by Polish consultants and the Technical Departments of the&#13;
Voivodhips' administrations.&#13;
D. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.23         The total Project cost (including contingencies, taxes and duties where applicable)&#13;
is estimated to be about US$145.6 million, of which US$125.3 would be for road and bridge&#13;
components under GDDP monitoring. The direct and indirect foreign exchange cost is estimated&#13;
at about US$76.1 million. These costs include 10% physical contingencies and 15% price&#13;
contingencies. A summary of cost estimates is given below and Annex 8 shows the estimated&#13;
Project costs in more details.&#13;

E. Financing&#13;
3.24         The proposed Bank loan of US$67 million would finance the full foreign&#13;
exchange cost, estimated at about 50% of the road accesses costs and of the coastal protection&#13;
costs. of the Bank-financed components (the financing plan of the Regalica bridge in Szczecin&#13;
provides for part of the works--access roads--to be financed out of the Bank loan, as indicated in&#13;
Table 3.3), and 100% of the technical assistance and training. The loan would be to the&#13;
Government of Poland. The Govermnent's contribution to the cost of the Project would be&#13;
provided:&#13;
(a)   through GDDP's budgets for most of the road accesses component;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
(b)   through voidvoships' budgets for complementary funding of some road&#13;
components, like the North Port Connection in Gdansk and the Regalica&#13;
bridge in Szczecin;&#13;
(c)   through MTME's budgets for the coastal protection component.&#13;

Financing arrangements and the availability of sufficient and timely counterpart funds for&#13;
the Project have been confirmed at negotiations (para.5.2.(iii)).&#13;
F. Implementation and Monitoring&#13;
3.25         The Department of Shipping and Seaports in MTME will act as the overall&#13;
coordinator of the Project, with the support of the existing World Bank Projects Monitoring Unit&#13;
(PMU) set up in MTME under the First Transport Project . GDDP will manage the road&#13;
accesses component, the Department of Sea and Inland Waterway Administration will manage&#13;
the maritime accesses and coastal protection components, and the Department of Shipping and&#13;
Seaports will manage the technical assistance and training component. The Director of the&#13;
Department of Shipping and Seaports will be the designated Project Coordinator. GDDP has&#13;
extensive experience in implementing Bank Projects, which is sufficient to enable it to efficiently&#13;
manage the road access component, and the PMU in MTME will provide the two Ministerial&#13;
Departments involved, as well as the Port Authorities, with any assistance they may require in&#13;
carrying out Project implementation tasks. An outline of the Project Implementation Plan is&#13;
given in Annex 9. The Project Completion Date is December 31, 2001, and the Loan Closing&#13;
Date June 30, 2002. An implementation schedule is given in Annex 10 and an estimated&#13;
disbursement schedule in AnnexI 11. These dates and the schedule are based on the Europe and&#13;
Central Asia Transportation Project standard disbursement profile.&#13;
3.26        To monitor progress in Project implementation and, in particular, on the&#13;
institutional side, there will be regular meetings between the Polish authorities and the&#13;
Bank, according to a schedule agreed during negotiations (para.5.2.(iv)). Supervision of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
contracts will be the responsibility of GDDP and Urzad Morski, under the overall monitoring of&#13;
the Department of Shipping and Seaports in MTME.&#13;
3.27               The development impact of the Project will be monitored through descriptive and&#13;
quantitative indicators relying mainly on port traffic statistics and modal split for land transport.&#13;
The Port Authorities will be required to provide this information on a regular basis through the&#13;
Project Progress Reports (Annex9). This reporting requirement has been agreed upon&#13;
during negotiations (para.5.2.(viii)).&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
3.28               Procurement of the Bank-financed elements of the Project will be carried  out as&#13;

All procurement will be carried out according to Bank guidelines of January 1995, using the&#13;
Bank Standard Bidding Documents (para.5.2.(v)).  A Project implementation schedule&#13;
appears in Annex 9.&#13;
Country Procurement Procedures&#13;
3.29        A Country Procurement Assessment Report has been prepared in 1995, has been&#13;
discussed with the Polish Authorities and finalized.&#13;
Domestic Suppliers and Contractors&#13;
3.30        The local construction industry in the road sector is already well developed, and is&#13;
participating in construction contracts financed under ongoing Bank Projects. It can therefore be&#13;
expected that local contractors will bid for the works included in the proposed Projects.&#13;
Implementing Agency&#13;
3.31        The Department of Shipping and Seaports in MTME will act as the overall&#13;
coordinator of the Project ,with the support of the existing World Bank Projects Monitoring Unit&#13;
(PMU) set up in MTME under the First Transport Project (para.3.25). GDDP will manage the&#13;
road accesses component, the Department of Sea and Inland Waterway Administration will&#13;
manage the maritime accesses and coastal protection components, and the Department of&#13;
Shipping and Seaports will manage the technical assistance and training component.  The&#13;
Director of the Department of Shipping and Seaports is the designated Project Coordinator.&#13;
GDDP has extensive experience in procurement in Bank Projects' implementation, which is&#13;
sufficient to enable it to efficiently manage the road access component, and the PMU in MTME&#13;
will provide the two Ministerial Departments involved, as well as the Port Authorities, with any&#13;
assistance they may require in carrying out procurement tasks. The MTME confirmed during&#13;
negotiations that it will maintain the PMU in accordance with staffing plan and Terms of&#13;
Reference satisfactory to the Bank (para.5.2.(vi)).&#13;
Notifications&#13;
3.32        The General Procurement Notice has been published in Development Business in&#13;
January 1996. The Project Launch Workshop will be held around mid-1996, and will give the&#13;
opportunity to review the detailed procurement arrangements for the different Project&#13;
components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
Methods of Procurement&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
3.33        The civil works, road and bridge construction and coastal protection works,&#13;
represent 95% of total Project cost. They will be procured under ICB under separate contracts&#13;
for the different Project components as described in para.3.4, and presented in the Procurement&#13;
Plan in Annex 12. Bidders will be prequalified for road and bridges construction, as well as for&#13;
marine works, using the Bank's Prequalification Document. The Bank 's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for Works, dated January 1995, will be used.&#13;
Equipment&#13;
3.34        Equipment will be procured under the Project according to the procurement plan&#13;
given in Annex 12. The Vessel Traffic Management System for the Szczecin-Swinoujscie&#13;
Fairway will be procured through ICB. All equipment procurement will follow Bank guidelines&#13;
and, since it will involve supply and installation, will use the Draft Bank Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for Supply and Installation of Plant and Equipment, dated February 1995.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
3.35        Technical assistance and training will be procured following Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Use of Consultants by Bank Borrowers. The Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consultants'&#13;
Services will be used. Thresholds for prior review by the Bank of procurement of Consultants'&#13;
Services will be US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firms, and US$50,000 equivalent for&#13;
individual consultants.  An overall framework for technical assistance and training is&#13;
provided in Annexes 6 and 7 and has been formally agreed upon at negotiations&#13;
(para.5.2. (ii)).&#13;
Bank Review of Procurement Documentation&#13;
3.36        All bidding documents for civil works will be subject to prior review and&#13;
approval of procurement documentation by the Bank. Bidding documents for purchase of&#13;
equipment, for contracts estimated to cost US$1 million or more will be subject to prior review&#13;
and approval of procurement documentation. Proposals for the engagement of consultants will&#13;
be reviewed in accordance with Bank guidelines (para.5.2.(v)).&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
3.37        The proceeds of the loan, amounting to US$67 million, will be disbursed as&#13;

A schedule of estimated disbursements based on the regional and sectoral historical profile is&#13;
included in Annex 11.  To facilitate timely Project implementation, the Borrower would&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under condition acceptable to the Bank, Special Accounts in the&#13;
currency of each loan tranche (i.e., in US Dollars and Deutsche Marks), as follows: two Special&#13;
Accounts A, one in US Dollars and one in Deutsche Marks, for use by GDDP; one Special&#13;
Account B in US Dollars, for use by MTME. During the early stage of the Project. the initial&#13;
allocations of the Special Accounts A would be limited to US$1 million for the Dollar Special&#13;
Account, and DEM 1.5 million for the DEM Special Account; and the initial allocation of the&#13;
Special Account B would be limited to US$0.6 million.  However, when the aggregate&#13;
disbursements under the loan have reached the level of US$7.5 million and DEM  11 million&#13;
respectively for the Special Accounts A, and US$4.5 million for the Special Account B, the&#13;
initial allocations may be increased up to the authorized allocations of US$2.25 million for the&#13;
Dollar Special Account A, DEM 3.34 million for the DEM Special Account A, and US$1.5&#13;
million for the Special Account B, by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal.&#13;
Replenishment applications should be submitted on a monthly basis, and must include&#13;
reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents&#13;
(para.5.2.(vii)). Retroactive financing of design, studies and technical assistance costs up to a&#13;
limit of US$1 million, and limited to the period after appraisal, i.e. October 27, 1995, may be&#13;
required. Disbursements would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts&#13;
up to US$1 million equivalent for which detailed documents evidencing expenditures will be&#13;
reviewed and kept by the Borrower, and made available for the required audit as well as to Bank&#13;
supervision  missions.    These  arrangements  have  been  confirmed  at negotiations&#13;
(para.5.2.(vii)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
I. Reporting, Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.38         GDDP, Urzad Morski and the Port Authorities will report to the Department of&#13;
Shipping and Seaports in MTME, which will act as the overall coordinator of the Project. The&#13;
Project Coordinator will compile a master report from these contributions and forward it to the&#13;
Bank. The format and timing of the progress reports, giving physical and financial progress&#13;
of the Project, have been agreed upon at negotiations (para.5.2.(viii)). MTME will be&#13;
required to maintain separate Project accounts for the Bank-financed parts of the Project, and to&#13;
have these accounts audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank.  Copies of the certified&#13;
financial statements and the auditor's report thereon should be provided to the Bank not&#13;
later than six months after the close of each filnancial year (para.5.2.(viii)). Furthermore the&#13;
Port Authorities will prepare, six months prior to the beginning of the each financial year,&#13;
financial forecasts for three years (Income Statement, Cash-Flow Statement and Balance Sheet) in&#13;
a format to be agreed with the Bank. These forecasts will be annually forwarded to the Bank&#13;
(para.5.2.(ix)).&#13;
J. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.39         The Project has been classified as a "B" under OD 4.00, meaning that only&#13;
limited environmental review will be required; however, the Wolin Road Improvement&#13;
component has been classified as "A", and therefore a full environmental assessment is&#13;
mandatory for this component. The Project does not involve, however, resettlement of people.&#13;
The following paragraphs present the status of the Project components with regard to their&#13;
environmental impact.&#13;
Improvement of the Road Connection between Swinoujscie and Szczecin through Wolin&#13;
3.40         A full environmental assessment for this component has been carried out by&#13;
Polish Consultants and its draft forwarded to the Bank Board in October 1995.  The&#13;
environmental assessment was then amended to integrate the remarks made during appraisal, and&#13;
the final version, received in the Bank in early January 1996, has been found fully satisfactory.&#13;
The overall environmental consequences of the improvement program will be as follows:&#13;
(a)   less air pollution due to an improved traffic flow, especially during peak&#13;
periods,&#13;
(b)   a reduction in air pollution outside the village of Dargobadz;&#13;
(c)   less air pollution in the Wolin National Park;&#13;
(d)   a corresponding reduction in traffic noise;&#13;
(e)    overall, a safer transport route; and&#13;
(f)   an enlargement of the natural afforested area in the Wolin National Park,&#13;
as a result of the agreement reached between the Park, the local&#13;
government and MTME .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
In view of the above, the Wolin National Park Authority confirmed its agreement on the Project&#13;
as designed, and the field investigations to precisely determine the portions of land which will be&#13;
handed over by the Park to the Voivodhip, to allow for the works to take place, have been&#13;
carried out. A specific mitigation plan to alleviate any possible impact on the fauna dwelling on&#13;
the park grounds has been devised as part of the environmental assessment. The National Park&#13;
agreement cleared the way for the official approval to be given by the Ministry of&#13;
Environment, which was a condition for negotiations, and was fulfilled accordingly on&#13;
January 22, 1996 (para.5.1).&#13;
3.41        During Project design, an alternative solution was considered, consisting of a new&#13;
alignrnent running North of the afforested area of the Park, roughly following the existing&#13;
railway track. However, this area is still part of the Wolin National Park, which goes up to the&#13;
seashore, and more importantly, is a preferred area for nesting and reproduction for numerous&#13;
animal species. Apart from the sheer cost factor, it appeared therefore clearly unsuitable for the&#13;
kind of works under consideration which, under this alternative, would have been of a much&#13;
greater scale than the limited improvement program finally adopted.&#13;
Other Roads and Bridges Components&#13;
3.42        The two other access road components present broadly the same environmental&#13;
urban context, and consequently the same pattern of environmental impacts, which can be&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   exhaust emissions will be reduced in the residential/urban areas;&#13;
(b)   exhaust emissions will be reduced by improved driving conditions and&#13;
reduced driving distances;&#13;
(c)   noise generation will be reduced in the residential/urban areas, and will be&#13;
more evenly spread over the available road network;&#13;
(d)   nuisance associated to noise generation will be lowered by reduced vehicle&#13;
transit time through the urban areas; and&#13;
(e)   hazardous cargoes and heavy  traffic will be diverted from  the&#13;
residential/urban areas, therefore increasing traffic safety and comfort for&#13;
the population.&#13;
Wisla Smiala Outlet Protection&#13;
3.43        The rehabilitation of the Wisla Smiala entrance will bring about the following&#13;
environmental benefits:&#13;
(a)   safeguarding the flow pattern of the waters through the Wisla Smiala&#13;
outlet, thereby ensuring effective flood prevention for the city of Gdansk;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
(b)   maintaining the local natural balance between the sea, the land and the&#13;
river, therefore contributing towards the stabilization of the seashore and&#13;
of the existing ecosystem.&#13;
To ascertain the nature and quality of sediments to be dredged out of the outlet as part of the&#13;
rehabilitation process, samples of sand were taken from the channel bottom and are being&#13;
analyzed. Final decision about the appropriate form of disposal will be made upon results of the&#13;
analysis. It was further agreed during appraisal that when dredging activities are carried out,&#13;
additional measures will be taken to better isolate the neighboring birds sanctuarium from any&#13;
potential threat. Moreover, when the outlet is rehabilitated, the Maritime Office together with&#13;
the regional branch of the Academy of Sciences will issue administrative restrictions on ship&#13;
speed in the outlet, cooperate on protection of the sanctuarium, and continue public consultation.&#13;
Implementation of a Vessel Traffic Management System in the Szczecin-Swinoujscie&#13;
Fairway&#13;
3.44         The implementation of a VTMS will greatly increase the traffic monitoring&#13;
capacity of the Maritime Office, and consequently contributes towards increased safety of&#13;
navigation in the fairway. This will in turn limit the risks related to ship accidents and any&#13;
accidental spillage of hazardous cargoes, such as the chemical products handled at Police in the&#13;
middle of the fairway.&#13;

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
4.1          Improvements in port accesses, both land and maritime, are prerequisites for&#13;
modernization and improvements of port operations in the ports considered.  This has been&#13;
demonstrated by the comprehensive Port Sector Study which identified improved accesses as being of&#13;
the highest priority. This conclusion is generally valid regardless of administrative arrangements, speed&#13;
of reform, degree of privatization, etc. Therefore the present Project, which is the first Project of a&#13;
more comprehensive Bank involvement in the modernization and restructuring of Polish ports, would&#13;
remain justified even if the further phases of restructuring would not materialize. Public sector&#13;
financing is fully appropriate since it involves public roads and maritime accesses and protection, a&#13;
category for which private financing, for reasons fully supported by the Bank, are not being&#13;
contemplated.&#13;
4.2          The Project is firmly anchored in both the country's transport strategy as well as in the&#13;
CAS as outlined in Chapter III.&#13;
B. Economic Assessment and Justification&#13;
Road Components&#13;
4.3          The road components of the Project have been evaluated using accepted evaluation&#13;
methods which take into account:&#13;
(a)   reduced transit time and road congestion to access the port operating areas,&#13;
(b)   reduced vehicle operating costs; and&#13;
(c)   reduced road accidents.&#13;
The benefits will accrue to road users in general, and in particular to the users of the ports, individuals&#13;
and enterprises, thus enhancing the efficiency of the sea/land trade interface. The indirect positive&#13;
effects are considerable since the port accesses form an integral part of the urban networks. The&#13;
improvement of the port accesses thus also contributes to the overall improvement of the traffic&#13;
situation in the cities concerned. Because of the intimate interaction with the urban networks, the&#13;
alignment and overall design of the port accesses have been given and are not open to altematives. The&#13;
one exception to this is the Wolin road where altematives were considered and rejected, mainly on&#13;
environmental grounds (par 3.16).&#13;
4.4          Economic Rates of Return and Net Present Values have been calculated separately for&#13;
each of the three road access components. Sensitivity analysis testing the impact of variations in&#13;
investments and expected benefits, have been carried out. An overall economic rate of return of 18%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
can be expected for the Project as a whole. The results are summarized below, and a detailed&#13;
presentation included in the Project File.&#13;

Other Components&#13;
4.5          The main justification for both the Wisla Smiala Outlet Protection and the&#13;
Implementation of a VTMS, which is the first phase of the Szczecin-Swinoujscie Fairway&#13;
Improvement, is safety concerns (paras. 3.8 and 3.19).&#13;
4.6          The Wisla Smiala river and its outlet into the Baltic Sea are the "relief valve" to the&#13;
flood waters of the Vistula River. The maintenance has been neglected however and this poses a&#13;
real threat to the safety of surrounding areas around the Vistula River, including the old city of&#13;
Gdansk. Large areas can be inundated because the discharge of flood waters into the sea is to a&#13;
high degree physically blocked. It is generally agreed that the present condition is very dangerous&#13;
for the safety of the region in the event of flood waters in the Vistula.&#13;
4.7          The VTMS is likewise a Project based on safety concems. Whatever solution is&#13;
adopted for the physical improvements to the fairway, a VTMS is needed. The proposed VTMS&#13;
is a necessary first phase of the fairway improvement.&#13;
4.8          Overall, the Economic Rate of Return for the Project as a whole can be estimated&#13;
at about 18%.&#13;
.&#13;
Percentage increase in investment costs which would decrease IRR to about 10%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
C. Project Risks&#13;
4.9           The main risk is the availability of adequate budgetary funds for GDDP to implement&#13;
the full access roads renovation program. However, it is already foreseen, as part of the ongoing&#13;
transport Projects, that GDDP's budget be annually reviewed and agreed with the Bank. In particular&#13;
the allocation of sufficient resources to cover the domestic share of the Project costs depends on this&#13;
agreement. The experience from the ongoing Roads Project has been positive in this respect.&#13;
Moreover, the firn commitment expressed by MTME to the swift implementation of the proposed&#13;
Project, together with the preparatory budgetary works already underway in MTME's departments,&#13;
add to the likelihood that the financing will be forthcoming as foreseen.&#13;
4.10         The [RRs for the road components are closely linked to the fbrecast traffic which in its&#13;
tum is dependent, in part, on forecast port activities. Port throughput is expected to grow by about&#13;
5% annually over the next ten years. A cautious approach to road traffic forecasting has been adopted&#13;
with annual increases of no more than 3%. This should be considered as a lower bound to likely road&#13;
traffic increases. Thus the forecast traffic development is not considered to be a potential risk to the&#13;
Project's viability.&#13;
4.11         There are no particular technical risks associated with the Project. However, the&#13;
bridges construction, which often entails the risk of cost overrun due to the very nature of the works,&#13;
will require effective supervision arrangements to minimize it. In any case, the costs overruns which&#13;
would put the viability of the Project in question (para.4.4) are well above what has been observed in&#13;
the ongoing operations in Poland. On average, the cost estimates correspond well with actual costs&#13;
and the highest differences observed have been less than 20%.&#13;
4.12         It is worth underscoring that, although the proposed Project is part of a two-stage port&#13;
modernization program (see para.3.1), its expected benefits are not contingent upon the actual&#13;
implementation schedule of the second stage operation, which will mainly deal with the modernization&#13;
of the physical port facilities. This second operation, by upgrading the ports' efficiency in handling the&#13;
expected throughput, and thus contributing to a possible additional traffic growth, would most likely&#13;
increase the benefits of the proposed Project. The justification of the proposed Project relies thus on&#13;
benefit streams coming from improved accesses to the ports, which are independent of the second&#13;
operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
5.1          Before negotiations, as agreed at appraisal, the Government forwarded to the Bank&#13;
the official approval granted by the Ministry of Environment for the Wolin Road Improvement&#13;
component (para.3.40).&#13;
5.2          During loan negotiations, confirmation or agreements have been reached on the&#13;
following:&#13;
(i)   as the Ports Law was not yet promulgated, the Polish Government confirmed&#13;
its willingness to carry out its activities in the port sector in accordance with the&#13;
Polish Transport Policy Paper and its provisions; a draft statement was handed&#13;
over to the delegation and has been submitted to the Polish Authorities for&#13;
acceptance (para.2.13);&#13;
(ii)   the technical assistance and training program in the field of regulation of port&#13;
activities, management and maintenance of public assets, and divestiture of&#13;
commercial activities to the private sector has been agreed upon with the Polish&#13;
Government (paras.3.21 and 3.35);&#13;
(iii)  the financing arrangements and the availability of sufficient and timely&#13;
counterpart funds for the Project (para.3.24);&#13;
(iv)   a schedule of meetings to monitor progress in Project implementation, in&#13;
particular on the institutional side (para.3.26);&#13;
(v)   procurement arrangements (paras.3.28/3.36);&#13;
(vi)   MTME will maintain PMU (para.3.3 1);&#13;
(vii)  special account and disbursement conditions (para.3.37);&#13;
(viii)  arrangements and format of quarterly and audit reports (paras.3.27 and 3.38),&#13;
(ix)   three-year financial forecast for the Port Authorities (para.3.3 8).&#13;
5.3          Based on the above agreements the Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$67&#13;
million equivalent to the Republic of Poland, through two SCL Tranches of US$ 33.5 million and&#13;
DEM 49.5 million respectively, with 17 years maturity with 5 years grace period with level repayment&#13;
of principal at the Bank's LIBOR-based floating interest rate.&#13;

PORT ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Financial Evaluation of the Port Authorities&#13;
1.    The Income Statements, Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheets for the Port Authorities of&#13;
Gdansk, Gdynia and Szczecin-Swinoujscie for the years 1992, 1993, 1994 and for the first six months&#13;
of 1995 are in pages 4 through 12 of this annex. During most of this period inflation was running at&#13;
over 30% per annum, significant restructuring of the Authorities' operating sections were implemented&#13;
and changes in accounting principles were introduced in compliance with Government directives. The&#13;
value of net fixed assets in the accounts of the three authorities as of December 31, 1992 compared to&#13;
the consultants estimated value ranged from 84% in the case of Gdansk to 134% in the case of Gdynia.&#13;
Caution must therefore be used in interpreting the accounts. In spite of these limiting factors,&#13;
however, it is felt that the Authorities' accounts provide reasonable guidelines of the financial results&#13;
and status during the three and a half year period ending June 30, 1995. All three ports have been&#13;
established as joint stock companies with the National Treasury holding all shares.&#13;
Port Authority of Gdansk&#13;
2.    In 1991 the Port Authority of Gdansk established the operating sections of the port into 31&#13;
separate associated or "daughter" companies.  Appropriate workers were assigned to the new&#13;
companies and the equipment and infrastructure of the port were provided on lease for the years 1991&#13;
and 1992. In 1993 and 1994 most of the equipment was sold under deferred payments contracts with&#13;
terms ranging from three to eight years to the "daughter" companies for about old ZL 0.5 billion. The&#13;
infrastructure continues to be owned by the Authority. The share capital of the "daughter" companies&#13;
is owned by the workers but the Port Authority of Gdansk has full control over these companies&#13;
through the annual leasing contract for infrastructure.&#13;
3.    The Authority achieved operating ratios in the 70% during the three years 1992-1994 but this&#13;
ratio increased to 82% during the first six months of 1995. The decrease in profitability in 1995 was&#13;
due to (i) a fall in traffic, mainly transit, (ii) the erosion of tariff through the devaluation of the US&#13;
dollar, and (iii) an increase in operating expenses caused by inflation. The rise in the latter expenses&#13;
was moderated io some extent by a reduction in the depreciation charge in a year in which the net&#13;
value of fixed assets increased 69% through revaluation. During the three and a half year period the&#13;
rate of return on average net fixed assets declined from 10.3% in 1992 to 5.8% per annum for the first&#13;
six months of 1995. The 69% increase in value of net fixed assets was a significant factor in this&#13;
decline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
4.    The level of investment during the three and a half year period was about 92% of the&#13;
depreciation charges. The Authority's internal cash generation was sufficient to finance the increase in&#13;
working capital, provide full financing of the investment program of old ZL 326 billion and provide for&#13;
a substantial increase in cash of old ZL 312 billion.&#13;
5.    The level of accounts receivable increased two fold in 1993 to old ZL 585 billion and was only&#13;
reduced by 10% by June 30, 1993. This is the result of including the balance outstanding on deferred&#13;
sales of capital equipment to "daughter" companies under accounts receivable. Gdansk does not have&#13;
a major problem to day in collecting leasing payments from associated companies. Net fixed assets&#13;
increased by 76% during the period but this increase was due to revaluation of assets to allow for&#13;
inflation. Accounts payable are substantial at ZL 503 billion but a significant part of this represent&#13;
changes in accounting practice which required the Authority to credit the Government with the value&#13;
of certain type of land for which the port did not have clear title. The Authority has no long-term debt.&#13;
The net equity value of the Governments holding in the Authority was old ZL 2,980 billion as of June&#13;
30, 1995.&#13;
6.    The Authoritys trading results for the three years 1992 - 1994 were satisfactory but a&#13;
significant decline took place during the first six months of 1995 (para.3). This decline in traffic in&#13;
1995 comes after an increase during the three previous years. The Authority's financial position is very&#13;
satisfactory and it should be in a position to finance major capital investment programs from its own&#13;
and borrowed funds, if necessary. A Government guarantee may be required due to problems in the&#13;
local capital market and country consideration for foreign borrowing. The Authority should be in a&#13;
position to pay for the Government guarantee together with the debt service obligation.&#13;
Port Authority of Gdynia&#13;
7.    The Port Authority of Gdynia is structured as a holding company which controls 100% of the&#13;
share capital of the "daughter" companies which it established to operate the port. Unlike the other&#13;
two ports, the revenue and expense of these companies are consolidated in the Authority's accounts.&#13;
The operating ratio achieved during the three and a half year period ending June 30, 1995 ranged from&#13;
69% in 1993 to 87% for the first six months of 1995. A major revaluation of assets took place in 1995&#13;
but the charge for depreciation fell to 45% compared to the 1994 charge. Without this change in&#13;
accounting the 1995 operating ratio would have been substantially higher. The depreciation charge in&#13;
1995 represents 3.4% of the revalued gross fixed assets compared to the 1995 charge of 10.6% of&#13;
gross fixed assets. The rate of return on average net fixed assets ranged from 15.5% in 1993 to 4.4%&#13;
in 1995 based on revalued fixed assets. The deterioration in Gdynia's results in 1995 were due to the&#13;
same factors that affected Gdansk, a fall in traffic, the erosion of the tariffs and increased costs resulting&#13;
from inflation.&#13;
8.    Internal cash generated from operations during the three and a half year period was sufficient to&#13;
finance the increase in working capital, capital investment of old ZL 660 billion, profit tax of old ZL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
430 billion and an increase in cash resources of old ZL 386 billion. Investment during the period&#13;
represented about 94% of the depreciation.&#13;
9.    Net fixed assets during the period increased by about 150%/o but this increase was due to the&#13;
revaluation of fixed assets. The Authority has no long-term debt. The Government equity in the&#13;
Authority is old ZL 4,954 billion.&#13;
10.   As in the case of Gdansk the Gdynia Port Authority's trading results were satisfactory during&#13;
the three years 1992 - 1994 but deteriorated in the first half of 1995. The Authority's financial position&#13;
as of June 30, 1995 was sound.&#13;
Port Authority of Szczecin-Swinoujscie&#13;
11.   The Port Authority of Szczecin-Swinoujscie is the owner of the port infrastructure. In 1991&#13;
there were 16 "daughter" companies which operated the port but these were transformed into 8&#13;
companies in 1994. The Authority is the owner of 45% of the shares in the "daughter" companies and&#13;
the balance of 55% is owned by the workers. Dividend received from these companies represent about&#13;
2% of revenue. As in the case of Gdansk, the major part of the Authority's revenue is derived from the&#13;
rent of leased infrastructure. The operating ratio ranged from 59% in 1993 to 85% for the first half of&#13;
1995. The rate of return on average net fixed assets ranged from 17.3% in 1993 to 3.6% for the first&#13;
six months of 1995. These results are in line with the results of the two previous Authorities and&#13;
Szczecin experienced the same fall in traffic in 1995.&#13;
12.   The Authority's internal cash generation was sufficient to finance an increase in working&#13;
capital, investment of old ZL 872 billion and profit taxes of old ZL 297 billion. The level of investment&#13;
represented 1500/a of the depreciation charges during the period. This was a higher level of investment&#13;
than the previous two Authorities and included construction of a grain elevator. All the investments&#13;
were undertaken with own financing.&#13;
13.   Net fixed assets increased by 140% during the two and a half year period ending June 30, 1995&#13;
to old ZL 3,019 billion. New investment represent about 17% of this increase and the balance was due&#13;
to revaluation. The Authority has no long-term debts and the Governments equity in the Authority&#13;
totalled old ZL 3,501 billion.&#13;

POLAND&#13;
PORT ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance Programme&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
L. Background&#13;
1.1          From the end of the Second World War the main Polish ports have been managed by&#13;
dedicated State Companies. The ports of Szczecin and Swinoujscie have been managed as one single&#13;
company to date, whereas the ports of Gdansk and Gdynia after having been managed by one port&#13;
authority until 1954, have since then been managed separately. These port companies were acting as&#13;
executive branches of the Ministry of Transport.&#13;
1.2          The port ownership and management structure was thus strictly centralised.&#13;
Moreover, the major ports also acted as home bases for Polish Ocean Lines, the national shipping&#13;
company. All seabome transports were also centrally planned. As a consquence, Polish ports&#13;
possessed a monopolistic position with regard to Polish foreign trade. They operated mainly on behalf&#13;
of the national economy and as transit points for cargoes from Czechoslovakia and Hungary, within the&#13;
COMECON framework.&#13;
1.3         In order to separate policy setting, ownership and management functions in a market&#13;
economy, the state port enterprises were transformed between May and November 1992 into Joint&#13;
Stock Companies of the State Treasury. The State, represented by the Treasury, is the legal owner of&#13;
100% of the capital of the Port Authorities Companies, with the formal rights with regard to the use of&#13;
capital and assets devolved to the Ministry of Ownership Transformation. In a later phase, the laAk&#13;
provides for the transfer of shares of the joint stock companies into the hands of their final&#13;
shareholders, the nature of whom has to be defined in the new Ports Law to be enacted.&#13;
1.4          The future organization of the sector will therefore consist of:&#13;
MTME, in charge of overaD sector monitoring and regulation, through two specific&#13;
departments: the Department of Shipping and Seaports, directly responsible for&#13;
supervision of the Ports Authorities and assessment of their development programs,&#13;
and the Department of Sea and Inland Waterway Administration, responsible for&#13;
navigation safety through the Maritime Offices, and for legal management of the port&#13;
public assets,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
the Port Authorities, in charge of the management of port infrastructure facilities, and&#13;
of the strategic development planning;&#13;
the private operating companies, in charge of all commercial operations in the port&#13;
areas.&#13;
H. Objectives of the Technical Assistance&#13;
2.1          The main thrust of the draft Ports Law is to provide for the new Port Authorities to act&#13;
as "landlords", in charge of managing the public infrastructure assets, while the port commercial&#13;
activities would be carried out by separate private operators, fully independent from the Port&#13;
Authorities. This concept, which is now broadly accepted among the port community, appears as the&#13;
most adequate arrangement. It must be complemented by a clear definition of the regulating role to be&#13;
played by MTME, which according to the draft law, will formally recover its monitoring function over&#13;
the sector as a whole, and will represent the State Treasury in the Port Joint Stock Companies.&#13;
2.2          The main objective of the Technical Assistance Program is to help the Polish&#13;
Administration, and in particular the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Economy (M`IME), to work&#13;
out the practical implementation arrangements, and related detailed regulations, required once the Ports&#13;
Law will have been passed, which is expected to occur in the first half of 1996.&#13;
2.3          Additional objectives include helping the three Port Authorities of Gdansk, Gdynia, and&#13;
Szczecin-Swinoujscie, implement the provisions of the new law and of the detailed regulations referred&#13;
to above. In particular, this refers to the need to formally separate port management from commercial&#13;
operations, and to monitor market activities in order to protect public interest.&#13;
IMI. Contents of the Technical Assistance&#13;
The Technical Assistance will focus on the following:&#13;
3.1    MTME&#13;
(a)   help the Directorate of Seaports and Shipping and the Directorate of Maritime&#13;
Administration and Inland Waterways to elaborate the detailed regulations&#13;
required to allow the Ports Law to be practically implemented;&#13;
(b)    help to establish the financial relationships setup between MTME and the Port&#13;
Authorities, and in particular:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;

i.    the specific conditions under which investments in port developments&#13;
or maintenance could benefit from partial or total national budget&#13;
funding, and the nature of these investments;&#13;
ui.    the definition of the financial contribution from the Port Authorities to&#13;
the national budget;&#13;
(c)    help the Directorate of Seaports and Shipping to work out market management&#13;
regulation for commercial port activities, with the aim to secure an open access&#13;
for outside private providers, while ensuring overall safety in port operations&#13;
and working standards;&#13;
(d)    help define the standard reporting requirements expected from  the Port&#13;
Authorities, in terms of financial statements, traffic and operations statistics,&#13;
development and investment policy, tariff policy,&#13;
(e)    help the Directorate of Maritime Administration and Inland Waterways to&#13;
elaborate the working relationship setup between the Maritime Offices (Urzad&#13;
Morski) and the Port Authorities, in particular:&#13;
i.    for maintenance dredging management and contracting;&#13;
ii.    for navigation aids management and connections with broader port&#13;
management information systems.&#13;
3.2    Port Authorities&#13;
(a)    help Port Authorities manage the separation of the commercial operations from&#13;
their public management responsibilities:&#13;
i.    financial advisory services to assist in preparing and implementing&#13;
divestiture of commercial activities;&#13;
ii.    manpower management assistance in dealing with possible staff&#13;
redundancies;&#13;
Hi.   financial management assistance in devising new tariff policy and tariff&#13;
schedules in line with a landlord port structure: leases, concession fees,&#13;
utility services pricing, general access and protection dues;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
(b)   help set up market monitoring regulations for supervision of private operators,&#13;
management of the open access policy to the market of port services,&#13;
prevention of monopoly abuses, and enforcement of safety standards and&#13;
environment protection rules;&#13;
(c)   help upgrade port management systems to comply with the reporting&#13;
requirements to be enforced by MTME, in particular in the field of traffic and&#13;
operations statistics.&#13;
IV. Implementation Period&#13;
4.1          The Technical Assistance program will be implemented throughout the Project&#13;
implementation period, the MTME component having to be initiated first, as soon as the Ports Law is&#13;
enacted, to allow the Port Authc,rities to adjust their policies thereafter. Implementation is foreseen to&#13;
last at least two years following the enactment of the Ports Law.&#13;
4.2          The Technical Assistance will be complemented by a Training programn managed by the&#13;
Department of Seaports and Shipping in MIME, and including the various areas of interest listed in&#13;
Annex 7. The Training program will be implemented in a flexible way, depending on actual needs and&#13;
opportunities, all throughout the life of the Project.&#13;

            The objective of the Port Access and
            Management Project for Poland is to improve: (I) physical
            access to the ports of Gdansk, Gdynia, and
            Szczecin-Swinoujscie; and (II) management capacity of these
            ports. The project's components include improving: (A)
            road accessibility, which will involve completing: (i)
            access to the Szczecin Central Port area, (ii) the Wolin
            road renovation, and (iii) the Gdansk North Port connection;
            (B) maritime accessibility, which will implement the Vessel
            Traffic Management System; (C) coastal protection,
            specifically that of the Wisla Smiala Outlet; and (D)
            technical assistance and training, which will focus on
            helping: (i) the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Economy,
            and (ii) the port authorities.
