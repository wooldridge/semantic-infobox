    The EcoSan concept sees human excreta not as a waste product, but&#13;
                                                                                     Illustration 1: Farmers Using Organic Fertilizers in Ciwidey, West Java&#13;
    as a valuable resource that can be used for the production of organic&#13;
    fertilizer and/or compost and biogas1. For human excreta to be used as&#13;
    a resource for fertilizer in agricultural food production, pathogens present&#13;
    in the excreta must be destroyed. There are two main methods of doing&#13;
    this: dehydration and decomposition. Dehydration basically involves&#13;
    removing the air from the excreta with the help of heat or ventilation, or&#13;
    the addition of dry material. In decomposition, pathogens are destroyed&#13;
    through biological processes, with the help of worms and/or bacteria.&#13;
&#13;
    Pathogens, however, are not distributed equally in human waste.&#13;
    Most pathogens are in the feces while urine is generally sterile. Urine&#13;
    also contains most of the nutrients, and provided that it is kept pure,&#13;
    after dilution can be directly applied as a fertilizer2. Although feces do&#13;
    not contain a high level of nutrients, they are a valuable soil conditioner.&#13;
    After pathogens in the feces are destroyed by dehydration and/or&#13;
    decomposition, the compost is applied to the soil to increase organic&#13;
    matter content, improve water retention, and increase the availability of&#13;
    nutrients and beneficial soil organisms.&#13;
                                                                                     The study was undertaken in eight districts in five provinces across&#13;
    Because urine becomes contaminated with pathogens when it has been               Indonesia. The respondents were 330 women and men, farmers and&#13;
    in contact with feces, a focus of EcoSan technology has been to separate         villagers, and included Muslims, Christians and respondents with traditional&#13;
    the urine from feces at the point of generation, using toilet pans that          beliefs. Four producers and retailers of excreta and urine based fertilizer&#13;
    collect urine separately from feces. This separation of urine and feces          were also identified and interviewed. However, they were not willing to&#13;
    also ensures that the feces are kept dry to enable dehydration to take           divulge financial information, which limited the study's ability to undertake&#13;
    place. Thus EcoSan technologies can be divided into two types: urine             the planned economic assessment.&#13;
    diversion toilets (UD), which use a small amount of flushing water, and the&#13;
    urine diversion dehydration toilets (UDDT), which do not use any flushing&#13;
    water.&#13;
                                                                                     DEMAND FOR ORGANIC FERTILIZER EXISTS&#13;

    Other EcoSan options include the Arborloo, which can be constructed as&#13;
    an offset (or direct) goose-neck pan over a shallow pit latrine. Once the        The most significant evidence for the potential for EcoSan acceptance&#13;
    pit is full the superstructure is relocated, the pit is covered with soil and    among the study respondents is that 82% of the respondents believe&#13;
    a fruit tree is planted in the covered pit. The fruit trees grow well with the   that the EcoSan system would be beneficial. The main reason for this&#13;
    additional nutrients. There are also other technologies that allow (or even      can be found in the potential ability to produce fertilizer themselves. More&#13;
    require) the combined collection of human excreta that are suitable to use       than half of the respondents expect that the EcoSan system would increase&#13;

considered najis, and should therefore not be consumed by Muslims.                    While the results show that people are largely willing to consume products&#13;

    view the selling and buying of urine and feces processed as fertilizers and&#13;
    hence valuable substances is allowed. The argument is that the price is           Illustration 2: A Focus Group Discussion on Community Perspective&#13;
    charged not for the najis itself, but for the human work of processing the&#13;
    najis, and for the transportation involved. Thus it is the work of processing&#13;
    and transporting that creates a market value for the urine and excreta. To&#13;
    support this view, several examples already exist in Java of human waste&#13;
    being composted, marketed and successfully sold to farmers through&#13;
    small scale businesses.&#13;

            Ecological sanitation : social factors
            impacting use of EcoSan in rural Indonesia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Access to improved sanitation remains a
            huge challenge in Indonesia. Joint Monitoring Program (JMP)
            2010 data indicate that around 38 percent of the rural
            population has access to improved sanitation services and
            that open defecation remains a widespread practice for over
            60 million Indonesians. The persistence of old habits and a
            lack of awareness form the basis of many challenges in the
            Indonesian sanitation sector. To change this situation there
            is a need to focus on changing sanitation and hygiene
            behavior within communities, in addition to increasing
            investment in sanitation services. The majority of
            Indonesians are Muslims (88 percent), and Islamic teachings
            provide instruction and guidance on sanitation habits and
            behaviors. The teaching requires that running water, if
            available, should be used for anal cleansing and certain
            materials, including human excreta and urine, are regarded
            as najis (ritually unclean). Apart from the
            'natural' feelings of disgust that most people
            express towards human excreta which result in anal
            cleansing, Islam requires ritual cleansing after being in
            contact with materials that are considered to be najis.
            However, the use of water for anal cleansing also appears to
            be a cultural habit as non-Muslim Indonesians also use water
            for anal cleansing, a fact confirmed by the study results.
