Abstract&#13;
At the mid-point of the 1980s, Egypt is characterized by intervention&#13;
and regulation in all facets of economic activity with the government&#13;
controlling some prices and directly determining some quantities. These&#13;
policy-induced economic variables have led to distortions that affect the&#13;
efficient allocation of resources and create misperceptions about the actual&#13;
opportunity cost of goods and services. One result is a misallocation of&#13;
resources and resultant heavy costs to the economy. During the period of the&#13;
seventies, external resources were abundant, and the economy was able to&#13;
sustain a high rate of economic growth despite the misallocation, whose costs&#13;
were not perceived as a heavy burden. In the eighties, however, the world&#13;
environment has been less favorable, and the inflows of external resources&#13;
have been and are likely to be more limited. Hence concern over the cost of&#13;
the misallocation of increasingly scarce resources is growing.&#13;
To analyze the relation between regulation, distortions and&#13;
macroeconomic performance, measures of the levels of distortion are needed, a&#13;
requirement that implies some evaluation of opportunity costs. This paper&#13;
presents an economy-wide framework, called MISR2, that provides a general&#13;
equilibrium evaluation of these costs and hence of distortions.a/&#13;
The MISR2 framework is designed to analyze the short- to medium-term&#13;
macroeconomic consequences of policies aimed at minimizing the costs of the&#13;
misallocation and distortions. The framework was used to analyze two sets of&#13;
policy interventions: (i) adjustments of regulated prices and quantities&#13;
within the same policy regime, that is, with the regulated variables remaining&#13;
a/ MISR is the Arabic name for Egypt. MISR2 is a more disaggregated and&#13;
technically advanced follow-up to MISR1, which is a very simple&#13;
aggregative model using the Transaction Value (TV) approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
controlled; and (ii) adjustments in the policy regime itself, an approach that&#13;
implies freeing controlled prices and quantities and letting market forces&#13;
determine them. In MISR2 the focus is on four areas of economic&#13;
intervention: (i) pricing of output in the public sector, (ii) employment and&#13;
wage policy in the public sector, (iii) the trade and excharge rate regime;&#13;
and (iv) rationing and subsidization as relates to households. In this paper,&#13;
MISR2 is used mainly to analyze the effects of adjustments in public sector&#13;
prices and in the regimes governing trade and exchange rates.&#13;
MISR2 disaggregates production into nine activities. Each production&#13;
activity can be further separated into two, based on whether production takes&#13;
place in the public or private sector. The distinction is needed on the one&#13;
hand to capture the different pricing rules governing the output of the two&#13;
sectors, and on the other hand to trace the relation between the pricing of&#13;
public sector output and the mobilization of savings. Households are&#13;
separated into two categories: urban and rural. This distinction reflects&#13;
the different nature of the labor market of the two groupings. The MISR2&#13;
framework also captures the government as an independent agent that collects&#13;
taxes, spends, saves and invests. The government also intervenes in various&#13;
markets by supporting certain prices and subsidizing certain commodities.&#13;
Finally, the rest of the world is separated into three groups in order to&#13;
capture the three pools of foreign exchange through which transactions with&#13;
abroad take place.&#13;
In order to obtain a quantitative evaluation of distortions, for each&#13;
market MISR2 distinguishes between the actual price and the opportunity cost&#13;
of the commodity concerned. The opportunity cost is determined for each&#13;
commodity based on the functioning of the market and the nature of&#13;
intervention. A measure of distortion in the market is obtained by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
calculating the difference between the values of transaction at the actual&#13;
price and the opportunity cost respectively.&#13;
A predominant result of increases in prices in the public sector is a&#13;
contraction of the economy. Raising prices is the same as imposing a tax on&#13;
private sector income. When no other policy intervention takes place, the&#13;
price increases generate an excess supply of resources in the public sector&#13;
that lowers total absorption in the economy. In other words, raising public&#13;
sector prices alone results in a trade-off between growth and efficiency.&#13;
While distortions will be less, that result will occur at the expense of a&#13;
slowdown in economic growth. The trade-off, however, can be improved by&#13;
combining price increases with demand management policies.&#13;
Another important result is that a program of reform which liberalizes&#13;
the economy with respect to the determination of prices in the markets for&#13;
public sector output, to wage and employment decisions in the public sector&#13;
and to determination of the exchange rate, will lead Egypt to a high-growth&#13;
path while at the same time improving the macroeconomic balance considerably.&#13;
A major reason is the improved efficiency of the public sector. In an&#13;
environment riddled with major policy induced constraints, the actual&#13;
productivity of key resources, foreign exchange, labor and capital, are much&#13;
below their true levels. Consequently, when the distortions are removed, the&#13;
realized productivity gains are substantial. The factors of production are&#13;
now mobile and respond to market signals which now better reflect true&#13;
econonic values.   Resources move from low productivity activities to high&#13;
productivity activities enabling both higher output and lower costs. The&#13;
macroeconomic balance also improves. Liberalization of the exchange rate&#13;
combined with improved efficiency in the public sector augments the growth of&#13;
exports, which in turn play a key role in sustaining high economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
With improved earnings from exports, the current account deficit also&#13;
narrows. The fiscal deficit falls as tax revenues increase because of the&#13;
higher economic growth, and the fiscal contribution of the public sector picks&#13;
up because of the price liberalization.&#13;
A further interesting result is that there is no necessary&#13;
contradiction between price flexibility and a dampening of inflationary&#13;
pressures. Price flexibility, by raising public savings, will contribute both&#13;
to improved efficiency of resource use and reduced budget deficits because of&#13;
greater public savings. Nominal aggregate demand will fall, whereas real&#13;
aggregate supply will rise, causing a decline in inflationary pressures.&#13;
As expected, in a flexible environment distortions are virtually&#13;
eliminated. Economic agents operate along their true supply/demand curves and&#13;
resource allocations are governed by price signals which reflect true economic&#13;
values. Consequently, the sources of rents no longer exist. In a flexible&#13;
environment the dualism between public and private sectors does not exist&#13;
since both face the same set of prices and operate under identical policy&#13;
framework.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
Egypt's development effort has reached a difficult stage of&#13;
transition. While growth in the 1970s was very rapid growth, in 1981/82 the&#13;
expansion of output, consumption and investment slowed significantly (see&#13;
Table 1.1). The medium- to long-term outlook is that, unless substantial&#13;
policy measures are implemented without delay on numerous fronts, the slowdown&#13;
will culminate in a long-term decline. The growth rate could drop to only&#13;

about 4 percent a year in the 1990s. Such low growth is neither desirable&#13;
nor even feasible for Egypt's development, since it will lead to growing&#13;
unemployment-and social problems. Egypt must continue to maintain strong&#13;

investment growth and to improve the efficiency of investment to expand and&#13;
renew its infrastructure and provide food, housing and employment to a&#13;
population that continues to grow rapidly, at 2.8 percent a year.&#13;
The high economic growth in the 1970s was chiefly the result of a&#13;
surge in foreign exchange resources, based mainly on exogenous factors--con-&#13;
cessional capital inflows, primarily from other Arab countries, earnings from&#13;
petroleum exports and from the Suez Canal, tourism receipts and workers'&#13;
remittances (see Figure 1). While these resources enabled Egypt to achieve a&#13;
high level of growth, they also made the economy very susceptible to outside&#13;
influences. Further, by enabling Egypt to enjoy rapid growth without much&#13;
stress on the domestic economy, they also helped policy-makers avoid&#13;
difficult choices concerning the trade-offs between consumption and&#13;
investment, the need to mobilize domestic resources to finance development&#13;
and the need to improve the foreign exchange capability of the economy.&#13;
Moreover, the growth was lopsided: sectors having very weak linkages with&#13;
the rest of the economy, e.g., petroleum, and the Suez Canal, grew very fast,&#13;
while domestic-based production sectors such as agriculture and industry grew&#13;
relatively slowly (see Table 1.2).&#13;
During the same period, government expenditures also grew very&#13;
rapidly. To a large extent they were financed through bank borrowing, with a&#13;
consequent rapid expansion in the money supply. The high growth in income&#13;
and money supply caused a rapid increase in nominal domestic demand. The&#13;
resultant pressures from the excess demand were mitigated through imports and&#13;
price increases. However, in order to moderate the impact of the resulting&#13;
inflation of the lower income groups, the government maintained a strict&#13;
policy of price controls on a wide range of goods produced by the public&#13;
sector.&#13;

This policy caused growing distortions that have left the economy with&#13;
severely misallocated resources.&#13;
The system of subsidies (rents) and taxes (negative rents) induced&#13;
by the price controls provided wrong signals to both public and private&#13;
enterprises, causing significant inefficiencies in the allocation of&#13;
resources. The exchange rate depreciated more slowly than the difference&#13;
between world and domestic inflation, thus lowering the competitiveness of&#13;
Egyptian exports in the world market while encouraging imports. Low interest&#13;
rates and an overvalued exchange rate promoted excessive and inefficient&#13;
capital intensity of production. The fixed prices of key commodities such as&#13;
energy products, wheat and flour promoted inefficient consumption, leading to&#13;
waste, loss of foreign exchange and high budget deficits. Since the burden&#13;
of fixed prices fell largely on the commodity-producing sectors (industry and&#13;
agriculture), resources shifted from those activities to trade and services,&#13;
which were more profitable. Within the commodity-producing sectors, price&#13;
controls and subsidies induced an inefficient pattern of production by&#13;
encouraging activities in which Egypt lacked comparative advantage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
(aluminum, iron and steel, basic chemicals and meat production) at the&#13;
expense of activities that should have been promoted more vigorously (cotton&#13;
textiles, manufactured food, cotton, fruits and vegetables (World Bank, 1983).&#13;
Apart from inducing a misallocation of resources, the pricing policy&#13;
also contributed to a weakening of the fiscal situation. The overall impact&#13;
of the price controls on the financial performance of public enterprises was&#13;
very negative (Ahmed, 1984). As a consequence, public enterprises frequently&#13;
had to resort to the treasury for financial support, further augmenting the&#13;
budget deficit and leading to an increase in the supply of money and in&#13;
inflationary pressures. Thus, paradoxically, price controls helped sustain&#13;
high inflation rather than reducing it.&#13;
The lesser flow of external resources since 1981 produced a slowdown&#13;
in economic growth. The downturn was triggered by a fall in oil prices,&#13;
exacerbated by a decline in tourism receipts and remittance earnings and a&#13;
slowdown in Suez Canal earnings, following the general slowdown in the world&#13;
economy (see Figure 1.1). The prospects for greater external resources are&#13;
not too bright. Therefore, the challenge that Egypt now faces is to make&#13;
those difficult choices it was able to avoid when exogenous resources were&#13;
plentiful. They involve: the mobilization of resources, raising the&#13;
efficiency of investments, improving the capability of the domestic economy&#13;
to absorb a growing labor force; and earning adequate foreign exchange.&#13;
Economic growth will depend on the pace and comprehensiveness of the policy&#13;
reforms which should be designed to eliminate the distortions in the&#13;
economy. The outcome will be improved efficiency and productivity of&#13;
investments along with greater mobilization of domestic resources to finance&#13;
Egypt's investment needs and to help restructure the economy so as to reduce&#13;
the dependence on exogenous sources of growth and foreign exchange earnings.&#13;
&#13;

Numerous policies have combined to sustain the pervasive distortions&#13;
in the Egyptian economy. Of them, price controls (including control over the&#13;
exchange rate) appear to be the most distortive. They are largely&#13;
responsible for the inefficiency of investments in both industry and&#13;
agriculture (World Bank, 1983). Moreover, as mentioned above, pricing policy&#13;
is an important cause of the large fiscal deficits Egypt has experienced:&#13;
the direct and indirect subsidy imparted by controlled prices exceeds&#13;
one-fifth of current GDP. Reform of the pricing policy should, therefore,&#13;
constitute a major component of any remedial program. Price liberalization&#13;
alone, however, will not necessarily improve all indicators. The impact of&#13;
other distortions on certain indicators might even be strengthened if only&#13;
public sector prices are adjusted and the other distortions are left intact.&#13;
What is needed, therefore, is a comprehensive policy package that includes&#13;
price liberalization as an active element.&#13;
The main objective of this paper is to study the macroeconomic&#13;
effects of price liberalization in Egypt. Chapter 2 contains an overview of&#13;
the macroeconomic framework used in the analysis, MISR2, a description of the&#13;
main distortions it captures, the measurement of these distortions and a&#13;
macroeconomic outlook for Egypt for the 1980s under the policy regime&#13;
prevalent in mid-1983. Chapter 3 presents an analysis of the short-run&#13;
(within a year) macroeconomic response of the Egyptian economy to a package&#13;
of policy measures that includes increases in public sector prices. In&#13;
Chapter 4 a medium-term--10-year--public sector reform program is described.&#13;
During the first five years public sector prices, although still controlled,&#13;
are raised in order to reflect opportunity costs better. During the later&#13;
five years public sector prices are freed and other distortions removed.&#13;
Chapter 5 offers a summary of the main findings. Detailed annexes describe&#13;
the technical aspects of the macroeconomic framework.&#13;

Chapter II&#13;
THE MISR2 FRAMEWORK FOR POLICY ANALYSIS&#13;
As stated in Chapter I, Egypt is now characterized by intervention&#13;
and regulation throughout the economy, with the government controlling prices&#13;
and setting some quantity targets. Price and quantity controls create&#13;
distortions in the sense that goods and services are not valued at their&#13;
opportunity cost. The distortions in turn affect the efficient allocation of&#13;
resources and have macroeconomic consequences on economic activity. The&#13;
outcome has been heavy costs to the economy. During the 1970s, these costs&#13;
were not perceived as a major economic burden: external resources were&#13;
abundant, and the economy was able to sustain a high rate of economic&#13;
growth. The world environment in the eighties, by contrast, has been less&#13;
favorable with inflows of external resources likely to be more limited.&#13;
Hence there is a growing concern over the cost of the misallocation of&#13;
increasingly scarce resources.&#13;
In order to analyze the relation between regulation, distortions and&#13;
macroeconomic performance, measures of the levels of distortion are needed.&#13;
As such, the opportunity costs must be evaluated. The MISR2 framework&#13;
provides a general equilibrium evaluation of these costs and distortions. It&#13;
also is designed to analyze the short- to medium-run macroeconomic effects of&#13;
policies aimed at lessening the costs of misallocation and distortion. The&#13;
framework is set up to analyze two sets of policy interventions: (1)&#13;
adjustments of regulated prices and quantities within the same policy regime,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
that is, the economic controls remaining as they are now; (2) adjustments in&#13;
the policy regime itself that would free controlled prices and quantities and&#13;
allow market forces to determine them. The focus in MISR2 is on four areas&#13;
of economic intervention: (1) the pricing of output in the public sector;&#13;
(2) public sector employment and wage policy; (3) the trade and exchange rate&#13;
regimes; and (4) rationing and subsidization of households. In this paper,&#13;
MISR2 is used to look at the effects of adjustments in public sector prices&#13;
and in the trade and exchange rate regimes.&#13;
This chapter provides an overview of the MISR2 framework and the&#13;
main distortions it captures. Those distortions are then defined and&#13;
measured. Finally, MISR2 is used to derive a macroeconomic outlook for Egypt&#13;
for the 1980s under the policy regime prevalent in mid-1983, along with the&#13;
accompanying levels of distortions. This outlook is not forecast. Rather,&#13;
it represents a view of the economy based on assumptions about the world&#13;
environment, policy interventions and the behaviors and institutional&#13;
arrangements governing the Egyptian economy.&#13;
II.1 AN OVERVIEW OF MISR2&#13;
MISR2 is a multisectoral, two-household, economy-wide framework of&#13;
the Egyptian economy.l/ It disaggregates production into nine activities,&#13;
with each production activity separated into two where appropriate, depending&#13;
on whether production takes place in the public or private sector. This&#13;
i/ a full account of the economics and specifications of MISR2 is given in&#13;
the appendices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
distinction is needed on the one hand to capture the different pricing rules&#13;
governing output in the two sectors and on the other hand to trace the&#13;
relation between the pricing of public sector output and the mobilization of&#13;
savings. Households are separated into two categories--urban and rural--&#13;
reflecting the different nature of their labor markets. The MISR2 framework&#13;
also captures the government as an independent agent that collects taxes,&#13;
spends, saves a'nd invests. The government also intervenes in various markets&#13;
by supporting certain prices and subsidizing certain commodities. Finally,&#13;
the rest of the world is separated into three groups to account for the three&#13;
pools of foreign exchange through which transactions with abroad take place.&#13;
MISR2 is a sequential equilibrium economy-wide model. It allows a&#13;
user to derive a path for the economy as a sequence of equilibria. The&#13;
equilibrium defined in each period is the outcome of the behavior of economic&#13;
agents and institutional arrangements in the economy. The latter ensure the&#13;
overall consistency of the independent decisions of the agents. The&#13;
equilibrium for each period within the 10-year timeframe is also dependent on&#13;
a set of conditions related to agents, policy intervenions, the world&#13;
envrionment and the endowments of the agents. These conditions are allowed&#13;
to change between periods according to behavioral and accounting rules or&#13;
exogenous trends.&#13;
In MISR2 the price of the output from each public sector activity is&#13;
regulated, and pricing is considered a policy instrument in the hands of the&#13;
government. One question is how the markets for these commodities clear.&#13;
For all markets except those for electricity, oil and services, producers are&#13;
assumed to maximize profits at the regulated price. Thus, they define the&#13;
level of supply associated with that price. The demand for exports is&#13;
satisfied first, taking its share of the supply. The remaining supply goes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
to the domestic market. Rationed in this way, demand has to adjust and does&#13;
so by an upward shift in the regulated price. That change will first&#13;
produce: (1) an expansion of supply; (2) a dampening of the demand for&#13;
exports; (3) a lower rationing of domestic demand. These responses of course&#13;
depend on the elasticities of supply and export demand. In the electricity&#13;
and service sectors, producers are assumed to satisfy whatever demand exists&#13;
at the regulated price. Their supply is thus perfectly elastic at that&#13;
price. There is a wedge between the regulated market price and the marginal&#13;
cost. If demand is beyond the supply that results in maximum profit,&#13;
producers are "taxed". Otherwise they receive a pure profit above the rent&#13;
associated with the maximum profit. An upward adjustment in the price of&#13;
electricity or services affects production through variations in demand and&#13;
has direct implications on the profitability of the sector. The oil market&#13;
behaves differently. The domestic price and output are fixed, and export&#13;
demand is pe.fectly elastic, conditions that allow the market to clear. An&#13;
upward adjustment in the price of oil tends to contract dometic demand and to&#13;
leave a larger exportable surplus.&#13;
Public sector wages, whether in urban or rural areas, are fixed and&#13;
considered as policy variables. The rural wage in the private sector is&#13;
assumed to clear the rural labor market whereas the private wage in the urban&#13;
sector responds between periods to unemployment and expectations of&#13;
inflation. Thus an endogenous wage differential between public and private&#13;
sector wages is allowed for. Further, it is assumed that migration from&#13;
rural to urban areas takes place in between periods according to the expected&#13;
urban-rural wage differential.&#13;
The MISR2 framework captures another feature of the labor markets in&#13;
Egypt. The government expects public sector activities to absorb a certain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
amount of the increase in the labor force. Thus, they do not have much&#13;
leeway in their hiring decisions.    Furthermore, they cannot fire labor except&#13;
under exceptional circumstances.    Thus, for all practical purposes their wage&#13;
bill is fixed. This rigidity in public sector employment is reflected in&#13;
MISR2 by assuming that labor in public sector acitivities is a fixed factor.&#13;
In this case a rent that may fall short or exceed the wage bill accrues to&#13;
labor. The difference between the rent and the cash payment is absorbed&#13;
through the operating surplus of the respective acitivities. In practice,&#13;
this amounts to a tax imposed on production in the public sector.&#13;
The MISR2 framework captures the trade regime in Egypt by assuming&#13;
three balance of payments with three exchange rates. The first balance of&#13;
payments--the central bank pool of foreign exchange--has a fixed exchange&#13;
rate and clears via net transfers of foreign exchange to the second balance&#13;
of payments--the commercial banks' foreign exchange pool. Most imports that&#13;
go through the central bank pool are restricted by quotas. The first balance&#13;
of payments thus works like a traditional balance of payments with a fixed&#13;
exchange rate and adjustments in net borrowing. The only difference is that&#13;
the net borrowing from abroad is assumed to be set by policy, and the&#13;
adjustment happens through net borrowing from the commercial banks' foreign&#13;
exchange pool. This latter pool also has a fixed exchange rate and fixed net&#13;
borrowing from abroad. Here, the supply and demand for foreign exchange&#13;
clear via a rationing of imports. Once compulsory transfers are made, there&#13;
is a certain amount of foreign exchange left, which is then allocated across&#13;
various commodities. This allocation, jointly with the world prices and the&#13;
exchange rate, determines the amounts of imports of each commodity through&#13;
the second poool. The third balance of payments corresponds to the parallel&#13;
market of foreign exchange. Here the exchange rate adjusts to equilibrate&#13;
the inflows and outflows of foreign exchange.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
There are three types of interactions between the three pools. The&#13;
first one, already mentioned, is the net borrowing or lending between the&#13;
central bank and commercial bank pools. A tightening of the foreign exchange&#13;
resources in the first pool leads to increased rationing of the imports&#13;
coming through the second pool, as the amount of foreign exchange available&#13;
there is reduced. Another interaction occurs through a spillover of imports&#13;
from the first and second pools into the third pool that drives up the&#13;
parallel market exchange rate. Thus excess demand for imports ultimately&#13;
shows up a depreciation of the parallel market exchange rate. 2/ The third&#13;
type of interaction is between the commercial banks and parallel pools:&#13;
while the total amount of workers' remittances is given in dollars, their&#13;
allocation between the two pools depends on the relative exchange rates.&#13;
Greater depreciation of the parallel market exchange rate relative to the&#13;
commercial bank rate results in a larger share of remittances going to the&#13;
parallel market.&#13;
Equity considerations have led Egyptian policy-makers, since the&#13;
early sixties, to establish a system of distribution of basic commod'ities at&#13;
controlled prices. More or less the same pertains in the early eighties. It&#13;
is captured in MISR2 by providing agriculture, food processing and other&#13;
industry commodities at subsidized prices to various users. The commodities&#13;
are not, however, available in unlimited quantities, and users are assumed to&#13;
face some rationing. In particular, households are off their notional demand&#13;
curves for these commodities. Increased availability of the commodities at&#13;
the controlled prices means an increased level of subsidization and a&#13;
deterioration in the budget deficit.&#13;
2/ However, because of institutional rigidities, imports are not allowed to&#13;
shift completely to the third pool without costs (see appendices).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
One essential feature of the Egyptian economy is the duality between&#13;
the public and private sectors. That duality is reflected in the&#13;
macroeconomic closure of MISR2. There are two pools of savings, one for the&#13;
private, the other for the public, sector. All the savings of the agents of-&#13;
the private sector are channeled to the private pool, which also receives&#13;
foreign savings through the parallel market of foreign exchange. The latter&#13;
savings are fixed in dollars and variable in domestic currency. The total&#13;
resources of the private savings pool are channeled partly to private&#13;
investors and partly to the public savings pool. This allocation is a fixed&#13;
share that is typically a policy tool of the government. When a policy&#13;
adjustment leading to an improved fiscal gap is implemented, there is a case&#13;
for reducing the share of private funds channeled to th public sector.&#13;
Indeed, a policy to improve public resource mobilization implies a transfer&#13;
from the private to the public economy. If in addition, the public sector&#13;
continues to borrow the same share of private funds, the resources of the&#13;
private economy will be squeezed and a reduction in private activity will&#13;
ensue. In other words, private investment is financially constrained. Thus,&#13;
the financing policies the government follows to fill the public sector gap&#13;
can crowd the private sector out.&#13;
The resources available to the public savings pool are composed of&#13;
funds obtained from the private sector, the savings of the public sector and&#13;
foreign savings coming through both the central bank and commercial bank&#13;
foreign exchange pools. These foreign savings are fixed in US dollars and in&#13;
domestic currency as the respective exchange rates are fixed. The resources&#13;
of the public savings pool are used to finance public investment. The public&#13;
sector investment budget is, however, a policy variable and is fixed&#13;
nominally. Hence it may exceed or fall short of the resources available to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
finance it. In the absence of changes in the policy of the public sector&#13;
relative to borrowing from domestic or foreign sources, an excess in public&#13;
sector investment results in an expansion of activity that tends to pull in&#13;
imports and to depreciate the parallel market exchange rate. Simultaneously,&#13;
agents whose spendings are import-intensive without much scope for&#13;
substitution face a deterioration in their real expenditures. This is&#13;
particularly the case for the current and capital expenditures of the public&#13;
sector. Thus excess public sector investment leads through the parallel&#13;
market exchange rate to a shift from imported to domestic goods. At the same&#13;
time it reduces the real value of import-intensive expenditures, lowering the&#13;
components of absorption.&#13;
II.2 DISTORTIONS AND THEIR MEASUREMENT IN MISR2&#13;
In a market economy, prices are signals that allow agents to make&#13;
economic decisions. Wrong signals are likely to lead to wrong decisions and&#13;
a consequent misallocation of resources and overall economic loss.&#13;
What is the characteristic of a wrong signal and the resultant&#13;
inappropriate price? Generally, an inappropriate price does not reflect the&#13;
opportunity cost of the commodity it values. 3/ That definition raises two&#13;
questions: what is the opportunity cost of a commodity and of how is it&#13;
measured? 4/ The MISR2 framework deals with these questions as described&#13;
below.&#13;
Consider the markets for commodities produced by the public sector.&#13;
In all activities apart from electricity, services and oil, producers&#13;
maximize their profits at the regulated prices, and domestic users are&#13;
3/ For a comparative review of price distortions and their relation to&#13;
growth, see Agarwala (1983).&#13;
4/ Other questions are: what are the causes of the distortions and in which&#13;
markets they appear?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
rationed.   Figure 2.1A shows the level of qT of production and supply at&#13;
the regulated price p.   In Figure 2.1B part of qT goes to exports, 5/&#13;
leaving qd for domestic demand.   The quantity q   is the level of the&#13;
ration. Given the domestic demand schedule D for public sector goods, the&#13;
virtual price p   (see Neary and Roberts, 1980) is the price that would&#13;
clear the market at the level of the ration. In other words, users would be&#13;
willing to pay p to acquire the level of ration qd. But actually they&#13;
yd&#13;
pay the regulated price p. If the schedule D is derived from utility&#13;
maximization, then the price p    is a measure of marginal utility that is to&#13;
the users of q a measure of its opportunity cost. Clearly from Figure&#13;
2.1B, the regulated price is different from the opportunity cost. The&#13;
difference between the value of qd at its opportunity cost and its&#13;
regulated price is the shaded area, which is a measure of the distortion in&#13;
the market.   The MISR2 framework allows p   and the shaded area to be&#13;
computed. The latter is considered to be a rent accruing to the users. It&#13;
goes back to their income and is reallocated with that income over all their&#13;
outlays.&#13;
The markets h'r electricity and services work differently, as shown&#13;
in Figure 2.2. In Figure 2.2A, the demand schedule is D, the marginal cost&#13;
curve is at MC and firms are obliged to supply along the line S at the&#13;
regulted price p.   The market eqquilibrium quantity  is at q . However, the&#13;
marginal cost of producing q is at p ; hence for that level of output&#13;
producers are not getting their marginaX cost, which is a measure of their&#13;
opportunity cost for producing qe- The regulated price p is different from&#13;
the opportunity cost Pv, and the level of distortion in the market can be&#13;
measured by the value of the shaded area. The MISR2 framework&#13;
5/ Besides exports, some purchases are made by the government trading&#13;
authority, but these are not price responsive.&#13;

allows the marginal cost p   and the difference in the value of q&#13;
measured at its opportunity cost and at the regulated price to be computed.&#13;
The shaded area is considered to be a negative rent to producers and is taken&#13;
out of their operating surplus. Consequently, actual rate of return on their&#13;
fixed assets is lower than if their output was measured at its opportunity&#13;
cost. Figure 2.2B represents a situation where the regulated price is set&#13;
too high, higher than the apportunity cost. Production is protected and is&#13;
getting a pure profit, measured by the shaded area, but consumers are hurt.&#13;
Public sector employment is another area of government intervention&#13;
that may lead to distortions. 'XBecause public sector firms have very little&#13;
leeway in deciding their level of employment, labor is considered in MISR2 to&#13;
be a fixed factor. At the same time, the wage the firms pay is a policy&#13;
variable fixed by the government. Public sector firms are thus in a&#13;
situation such as the one described in Figure 2.3. D is the schedule of the&#13;
marginal productivity of labor, L is the labor force, and w represents the&#13;
regulated wage. The marginal productivity of L that can be considered a&#13;
measure of its opportunity cost is at wv; firms pay a wage bill in excess&#13;
of the opportunity cost value of the labor services they get equal to the&#13;
shaded area. That bill is an additional negative rent on the firms that&#13;
further cuts into their operating surplus and profitability. The shaded area&#13;
in Figure 2.3 can be used as a measure of the distortion in the labor market&#13;
faced by public sector firms.&#13;
All the agents intervening in the economy have demands for imports.&#13;
In MISR2, imports come through the three foreign exchange pools. But in the&#13;
first two pools - central bank and commercial bank - imports are rationed&#13;
through quotas and the allocation of foreign exchange, respectively. The&#13;
assumption is that agents have a demand for a composite of imports and that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
they allocate that demand through the three pools by minimizing the cost of&#13;
obtaining the composite of imports. They thus have explicit demands for&#13;
imports from each pool. 6/ Through the first two pools, the supply and&#13;
demand for imports are as shown in Figure 2.4. The demand schedule is at D&#13;
and imports are rationed at qm. The users' oportunity cost for q is the&#13;
marginal utility of qm given by Pv, the virtual price. However, given&#13;
the actual world price and the exchange rate, users are really paying pm.&#13;
TIus, the opportunity costs of imports through the two first pools of foreign&#13;
exhange are different from the market prices charged for them. This&#13;
distortion is measured by the shaded area shown in Figure 2.4. The value of&#13;
the shaded area is a rent that accrues to the users of the imports. It goes&#13;
into their income account and is allocated, together with the rest of the&#13;
users' income, on various outlays.&#13;
One last area of government regulation captured by MISR2 is the&#13;
provision of subsidized commodities to households, in particular agricultural&#13;
goods, processed food and other industrial goods. The availability of these&#13;
goods at subsidized prices is limited, and the markets faced by the&#13;
households are like the one described in Figure 2.lB,. The ration is qd&#13;
and the subsidized price p. The price p measures the opportunity cost to&#13;
households of the level of ration qd. Again the shaded area can be used as&#13;
a measure of distortion. It is a rent that accrues to households. This is&#13;
captured in MISR2 by adding that rent to households' disposable income, which&#13;
is reallocated over consumption and savings.&#13;
6/ This specification is adopted in order to reflect institutional&#13;
constraints that do not allow agents to shift fully between the pools to&#13;
meet their demand.&#13;

Thus in all markets where there is regulation, the MISR2 framework&#13;
allows computation of the opportunity costs that result from the defined&#13;
general equilibrium.7/ These can then be compared with the actual regulated&#13;
prices. The difference in the opportunity cost and regulated price value.s of&#13;
the goods traded is used as an indication of the level of distortion. In&#13;
practice the share of the rent in GDP or the ratio of the virtual to the&#13;
regulated prices can be used.&#13;
II.3 MACROECONOMIC TRENDS IN THE REFERENCE PARTH&#13;
This section presents the macroeconomic results of the reference&#13;
path, which provides a benchmark for comparing the impact of policy changes&#13;
on the various macroeconomic variables. In deriving the results of the&#13;
reference path, it is assumed that policy regimes and interventions remain&#13;
the same as in the past. Thus, the existing policy framework, with its price&#13;
and exchange rate regimes, is assumed, with only limited adjustments in all&#13;
government-controlled prices (see Table 2.1). Similarly, fiscal and monetary&#13;
'policies are assumed to remain unchanged.&#13;
In some of these areas the government has recently initiated certain&#13;
policy reforms, while other measures are under consideration. None of these&#13;
actions is, however, reflected in the reference path described below, mainly&#13;
because the scope and timing of the more important policy initiatives remain&#13;
uncertain.&#13;
7/ The virtual prices or opportunity costs computed in MISR2 are conditional&#13;
on other distortions in the economy. Thus they could still be far from a&#13;
"pure" opportunity cost where no distorition exists.&#13;

The reference scenario is not a projection of Egypt's future. It&#13;
simply reflects how the principal macroeconomic aspects of the ecnomy would&#13;
evolve given the underlying assumptions.&#13;
3.a External Environment&#13;
As pointed out in Chapter 1, the major challenge facing&#13;
policy-makers in Egypt emanates from the likelihood that the external factors&#13;
which underlay the rapid economic growth since 1974 will be less favorable in&#13;
th future. In defining the prospective external environment in the medium-&#13;
and long-term, four factors are particularly important: petroleum and gas,&#13;
workers' remittances, receipts from the Suez Canal and from tourism, and&#13;
inflows of external capital. The key assumptions relating to these and other&#13;
factors in the external environment are summarized in Table 2.2.&#13;

Prospects for Oil and Gas&#13;
During the last several years Egypt has been successful in&#13;
attracting large volumes of foreign investment in the oil sector, which has&#13;
sustained a vigorous oil exploration and development effort. Although the&#13;
success rate of this effort has been high, no new large discoveries have been&#13;
made. Thus, the growth of oil production in the medium-term will depend on&#13;
the pace of development of the newly discovered smaller fields and additional&#13;
investments in secondary recovery to offset the declining production from the&#13;
older, larger fields. In the longer term--beyond the mid-1980s--there is&#13;
greater uncertainty about oil production because the projections of output&#13;
have to be based on yet undiscovered fields. The incremental cost of finding&#13;
and producing Egypt's oil will increase steadily, a trend that will have an&#13;
adverse effect both on Egypt's share of the oil produced and on the&#13;
attractiveness to oil companies of additional investment. On the whole,&#13;
therefore, the outlook is that oil production will decline gradually, slowing&#13;
considerably in the later years of 1980s.&#13;
Another issue is the international price of oil. There is a great&#13;
deal of uncertainty about future price trends, given recent upheavals in the&#13;
oil market. Current expectations are that oil prices will rise very slowly&#13;
over the next two years and then recover somewhat in the medium-term. They&#13;
are, however, unlikely to show large real increases.&#13;
The prospects for increasing natural gas output are very favorable,&#13;
since reserves are relatively abundant and both associated gas and existing&#13;
gas fields are presently underexploited. However, the substitution of gas&#13;
for oil in energy use will require synchronized investments in the&#13;
development of fields and related distribution networks, and in creating a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
capacity in the power and industrial sectors to use natural gas. In the&#13;
medium term these investments are likely to constrain the potential&#13;
utilization of natural gas.&#13;
Workers' Remittances&#13;
Workers' remittances have been another major source of external&#13;
earnings for Egypt. With Egypt's increasing financial openness, remittances&#13;
are now more susceptible to the political climate and financial conditions,&#13;
as demonstrated by the large dip in remittances in 1981/82. Thus, in the&#13;
short term remittances should show greater volatility. At the same. time, the&#13;
underlying trends that drive the medium term have also become less&#13;
favorable. First, the rapid outmigration that characterized the 1970s&#13;
appears to have slowed dramatically. With increased competition from other&#13;
labor sources and slower income growth projected in the labor-importing&#13;
countries because of reduced earnings from oil exports, the prospects for&#13;
continued net outmigration are limited. Real income of migrants will, of&#13;
course, continue to increase, but so will their standards of consumption. A&#13;
great deal will also depend on political conditions and investment&#13;
opportunities in Egypt compared with abroad. The most likely scenario is one&#13;
of continued but slower real growth of remittances in the medium ter'm.&#13;
Suez Canal Earnings and Tourism Receipts&#13;
Large increases in Suez Canal earnings also appear unlikely.&#13;
Although tariffs have been raised substantially in recent years, further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
large increases will be difficult to achieve without eroding&#13;
competitiveness. On the other hand, there is still potential for increasing&#13;
the flow of traffic and raising the proportion of large vessels on the basis&#13;
of the recent expansion.   Nevertheless, even assuming a sustained expansion&#13;
of the world economy, the pace of revenue growth will not match that of the&#13;
1970s.&#13;
Like the Suez Canal, the prospects for continued increases in&#13;
tourism receipts, which are a major determinant of other exports of&#13;
non-factor services, are only moderately favorable and are contingent on&#13;
economic recovery in the industrial countries. Because of considerable&#13;
investment, hotel capacity has greatly increased; however, other tourist&#13;
facilities need to be upgraded. While tourism earnings are projected to&#13;
increase steadily, once again they are unlikely to match past growth.&#13;
Flows of External Capital&#13;
As discussed in Chapter 1, the large increase in capital inflows&#13;
during the second half of the 1970s allowed not only to finance a growing&#13;
level of imports, but also to raise the level of foreign savings available&#13;
for investment. A reversal of this trend has, however, been discernible&#13;
since 1979, with a slowdown in official aid commitments and a rise in debt&#13;
service payments.&#13;
Foreign investment within the Law 43 framework has slowed somewhat&#13;
in recent years. In response, the government has introduced several measures&#13;
to streamline investment. Assuming further efforts in this direction, Egypt&#13;
should be able to attract large volumes of investment under the Law 43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
framework. The present outlook, therefore, is one of continued modest growth&#13;
in direct foreign investment.&#13;
Official aid flows will depend on the growth of new commitments and&#13;
the disbursement rate. At present, roughly 35 percent of new commitments are&#13;
in the form of commodity aid. The remainder consists largely of project&#13;
loans, with virtually no direct balance of payments financing. Five sources&#13;
account for almost 85 percent of official aid: involving four bilateral&#13;
programs, Japan, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany and&#13;
France, and multilateral support from the World Bank. The growth in&#13;
commitments from all these sources is expected to decelerate over the next&#13;
few years and in some cases these commitments may decline in real terms.&#13;
Therefore, it is unlikely there will be any large real increases in the&#13;
growth in total aid commitments. One source of additional finances is&#13;
renewed lending by the Arab countries. While this is possible, the levels&#13;
are likely to be smaller than in the past. Despite the anticipated slowdown&#13;
in the growth of commitments, a somewhat faster rate of increase of&#13;
disbursements (i.e., actual inflows) should be possible based on more rapid&#13;
utilization of foreign aid.&#13;
Nevertheless, net resource transfers from foreign aid will not show&#13;
a significant increase because of the debt service requirements. Given the&#13;
debt structure and rising level of outstanding debt, Egypt will have to&#13;
finance increasing levels of both interest and amortization payments over the&#13;
next five years.&#13;
Given Egypt's large import and development needs and the anticipated&#13;
slowdown in foreign exchange earnings, net official aid and transfers, Egypt&#13;
may have to rely more on non-concessional flows than in the past. This trend&#13;
has already been discernible in the last two to three years. The shorter&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
maturities and higher interest rates of these flows tend to limit the growth&#13;
of commercial borrowing. Nevertheless, in the second half of the 1980s--when&#13;
the slowdown in oil earnings is expected to more pronounced--Egypt may have&#13;
to seek such additional financing to meet its balance of payments needs.&#13;
II.4 THE REFERENCE PATH RESULTS&#13;
Table 2.3 summarizes the growth scenario underlying the reference&#13;
path. The average annual real rate of growth of GDP is only 5.9 percent in&#13;
the reference path, compared with 9.4 percent during 1974-1981/82. This&#13;
considerable slowdown is the result of both the poor investment performance&#13;
and the growing level of distortions. Real investment rises by only 3.4&#13;
percent annually, compared with 12.6 percent during 1974-1981/82. The&#13;
decline in investment growth reflects the difficulties associated with&#13;
mobilizing resources. The slowdown in investment and income also has adverse&#13;
effects on consumption and employment growth.&#13;
The difficulties encountered in mobilizing savings for financing&#13;
investment are illustrated in Tables 2.4 and 2.5. The main reason for the&#13;
decline in investment growth is the lower availability of foreign savings&#13;
(Table 2.5). Domestic savings fail to offset the impact of this slowdown.&#13;
Thus public savings remain flat, while private savings show only marginal&#13;
improvement. The disaggregation of public savings indicates government&#13;
savings continue to be negative, while public company savings are virtually&#13;
unchanged, despite the significant premium obtained from the exchange rate&#13;
system. The overall fiscal deficit remains very high (Table 2.6). Budgetary&#13;
difficulties are linked to the decline in foreign resources, since a major&#13;

component of budgetary revenue depends significantly on petroleum and Suez&#13;
Canal earnings, which are now much less favorable. The small decline in the&#13;
overall fiscal deficit is predicated on the maintenance of the present&#13;
program of expenditure control. Based on this assumption, both current&#13;
expenditures and subsidies fall as a percentage of GDP.&#13;
Export performance declines sharply from 12.7 percent during&#13;
1974-1981/82 to 5.9 percent in the reference path. This is primarily&#13;
attributable to a fall in oil exports. Non-oil exports do not show much&#13;
improvement, partly because of incentives, but chiefly because of the&#13;
inefficiency of production. The depreciation of the parallel market exchange&#13;
rate is much less than the differential between domestic and world inflation,&#13;
causing a deterioration in the international competitiveness of Egyptian&#13;
exports (see Table 2.7).&#13;
More importantly, a major problem highlighted in the reference path&#13;
is the growing impact of distortion on the Egyptian economy (Table 2.8). The&#13;
misallocation of resources induced by these distortions is an important&#13;
factor contributing to the decline in Egypt's growth prospects in the&#13;
reference path.&#13;

SHORT-RUN RESPONSES TO INCREASES IN PUBLIC SECTOR PRICES&#13;
One purpose in adjusting public sector prices is to improve the&#13;
incentives in the public sector and allow for better resource mobilization.&#13;
This expectation and the likelihood of lower distortions and higher&#13;
efficiency in the economy suggest that public sector prices be increased.&#13;
That policy, however, raises specific questions. What will the price&#13;
increases have on GDP and the level of economic activities? Are the&#13;
potential gains in terms of improved public finances and allocative&#13;
efficiency worth the adjustment costs? How will wages and employment&#13;
respond? What will be the effects on the external accounts and on&#13;
transactions with the rest of the world?&#13;
The following section addresses the short-run (within a year)&#13;
macroeconomic response of the Egyptian economy to a package of policy&#13;
measures that includes increases in the prices of all public sector&#13;
production output, as well as aggregate demand policies aimed at smoothing&#13;
the disabsorption effects of the price increases. In this time frame&#13;
production capacities do not change, nor do urban wages vary in response to&#13;
changes in the levels of activities and allocation signals ensuing from the&#13;
application of the policy package. The specific envisaged complementary&#13;
policies are: (1) additional investment expenditure by state enterprises;&#13;
(2) a devaluation of the commercial banks exchange rates; (3) additional&#13;
foreign borrowing by the public sector; and (4) less borrowing of private&#13;
sector funds by the public sector. The increased investment expenditures and&#13;
foreign borrowing on the one hand and lower domestic borrowing on the other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
aim at maintaining the level of aggregate demand in the economy. The purpose&#13;
of the devaluation is to compensate for the negative effect of the price&#13;
increasers on exports going through the commercial bank pool.&#13;
The definition of macroeconomic equilibrium in MISR2 and the&#13;
financing of the fiscal gap are discussed in Section III.1. It is an&#13;
important mechanism embedded in MISR2 that underlies many of the results.&#13;
Section III.2 provides details on the effects of increases in each public&#13;
sector price, while the policy and world environment of the economy remain&#13;
constant. The Section also looks at the short-run macroeconomic and&#13;
distortion effects. Section III.3 considers the role of the aggregate demand&#13;
policies. Finally, in Section III.4 the price increases and aggregate demand&#13;
policies are combined into a package and the short-run response of the&#13;
economy to this package is then analyzed.&#13;
III. 1 MACROECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM AND THE FINANCING OF THE FISCAL GAP&#13;
A predominant outcome of the increases in public sector prices is a&#13;
contraction of the economy. It can best be understood by considering the&#13;
conditions of macroeconomic equilibrium summarized in Table 3.1. Relation A&#13;
determines the total resources mobilized by the private sector. The latter&#13;
are allocated, in relations B and C, among resources left to the private&#13;
sector for its own investment expenditures (in proportion 1 - P    ).  The&#13;
parameter p is considered to be policy instrument in the hands of the&#13;
government.8/ Relation D defines the fiscal gap as the resources needed by&#13;
the public sector, in addition to its own savings, to carry out its&#13;
8/ For example, one policy may be to force banks to hold a share of their&#13;
deposits in govenment bonds.&#13;

investment expenditures. Finally, relation E indicates how the fiscal gap&#13;
is financed: (1) borrowing from the private sector; (2) social security&#13;
savings; and (3) borrowing from abroad through both the commercial bank and&#13;
central bank pools. In this macroeconomic equilibrium, reflecting a&#13;
realistic perception of the workings of the Egyptian economy, the following&#13;
are maintained as exogenous policy variables: (1) public sector investment&#13;
expenditure; (2) borrowing from abroad through the three pools; (3) the&#13;
central bank and commercial bank exchange rates; and (4) the share p of&#13;
private resources channeled to the public sector.&#13;
Consider, now, an increase in the output prices of the public&#13;
sector in the absence of any other intervention, and, in particular, in the&#13;
absence of variations in the share of private funds to be borrowed by the&#13;
public sector. The price increases tend to improve the mobilization of&#13;
savings in the public sector. The fiscal gap narrows, and more funds are&#13;
available to the public sector. However, the public sector does not expand&#13;
either current or capital expenditures. As a consequence, it has resources&#13;
in excess of planned expenditures. If the latter are not changed, if no&#13;
reduction in foreign borrowing takes place and if the share of private funds&#13;
directed to the public sector does not vary, the only channel left to&#13;
reaching macroeconomic balance is to reduce incomes. The latter, coupled&#13;
with the cost-push elements associated with the price increases, contracts&#13;
the economy.&#13;
The contraction is likely to affect the private sector more.&#13;
Indeed, that sector now faces increased competition from the public sector&#13;
in the markets for outputs, leading to a relative decline in private sector&#13;
prices. At the same time, the cost-push effects develop. On the one hand,&#13;
the increased public sector prices feed into the cost of intermediates,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
while on the other, inasmuch as the public sector is producing tradables,&#13;
exports are affected adversely. In turn, foreign exchange and imports&#13;
become more expensive, adding to the costs of intermediates. The public&#13;
sector bears the burden of the higher costs of intermediates, but it is&#13;
protected by the regulated prices of its output. Thus, the domestic terms&#13;
of trade shift against the private sector. Because it has greater&#13;
flexibility in decision-making, private sector cuts back its output.&#13;
Table 3.2 illustrates the different responses of the private and&#13;
public sectors to price increases in the latter. Except for food&#13;
processing, the mobilization of savings in the private sector suffers,&#13;
implying less investment.9/ To the contrary, the public sector improves its&#13;
resource mobilization, and its investment as a share of GDP increases.&#13;
Thus, when no other policy intervention takes place, an increase in&#13;
public sector prices tends to contract the economy, a contraction that is&#13;
felt more in the private sector. The reason is that price increases embody&#13;
two main features: (1) an excess supply of resources in the public sector,-&#13;
which causes a contraction of income in the economy; and (22) the prices of&#13;
private seactor output prices fall relatively, leaving the private sector&#13;
facing increased costs for imports and public sector goods.&#13;
A more specific discussion of the effects of raising public sector&#13;
prices is presented below, in which the various public sectors are&#13;
considered individually. Following that, the effect of other policies that&#13;
would eventually be associated with price increases are considered.&#13;
Finally, the way these associated policies modify the effects of the price&#13;
increases is analyzed.&#13;
9/ Food processing is discussed below. In essence, the price increase&#13;
raises output in public sector food processing, which then raises&#13;
private agricultureal output.&#13;

III.2 Increasing Public Sector Prices&#13;
Public sector activities are not homogenous. Some produce&#13;
tradables, others non-tradables, some sectors face a regulated price but can&#13;
determine their level of activity and let demand adjust, others have to&#13;
satisfy demand at the regulated price. To account for these differences and&#13;
the implications of price adjustments, public sector activities are&#13;
classified into four categories: (1) supply-driven sectors producing&#13;
tradables; (2) supply-driven sectors producing non-tradables; (3)&#13;
demand-driven sectors; and (4) oil. In the supply-driven sectors, producers&#13;
maximize their profits at the regulated price; thus they determine their&#13;
level of activity, and the domestic market for their output is rationed. In&#13;
the demand-driven sectors, supply is perfectly elastic, and the level of&#13;
activity can be below or above the maximum profit level. In the latter&#13;
case, producers incur a negative rent.&#13;
2.a Supply-Driven Sectors Producing Tradables&#13;
Agriculture, food processing, other industry, and transportation&#13;
and communications are supply-driven sectors producing tradables. They&#13;
maximize their profits at a regulated price, which determines their level of&#13;
supply. Given the price of substitutable commodities on the world market&#13;
and the specific exchange rate, the demand for exports takes its share of&#13;
the supply, as do, eventually, the government-trading agencies. The&#13;
remaining supply is for the domestic market, which is thus rationed. Public&#13;
sector activities have a fixed wage bill and can increase production only&#13;
through more intensive use of intermediaries. Tables 3.3 and 3.4, columns&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
1, 2, 3, 4 and 8, show the percentage change in the macroeconomic and&#13;
distortion indicators that results from a 1 percent increase in prices in&#13;
the supply-driven sectors producing tradables.&#13;
Agriculture&#13;
Public sector agriculture is relatively small, with little weight&#13;
in the economy. *This is shown by the minor changes induced by an increase&#13;
in the price of the output of this sector (see Table 3.3), column 1). The&#13;
general effect is a slight contraction of the economy, with a depreciation&#13;
of the parallel market exchange rate, a decline in the rural wage and an&#13;
improvement in the finances of the public sector. The implications for&#13;
distortions are mixed: they are alleviated in some areas and exacerbated in&#13;
others.&#13;
The contraction of the economy comes about as follows. The&#13;
increase in the output price hurts agricultural exports, which are channeled&#13;
through the central bank pool of foreign exchange. This adverse effect&#13;
leads to a larger transfer of foreign exchange from the commercial bank pool&#13;
to the central bank. The availability of foreign exchange in the commercial&#13;
bank pool is consequently reduced implying a tighter foreign exchange budget&#13;
and a reduction in the quantity of imports possible through the commercial&#13;
bank pool. The demand for imports then tends to spillover to the parallel&#13;
market, inducing a depreciation in the exchange rate there. That&#13;
depreciation in turn tends to lower the share of workers' remittances coming&#13;
into the country through the commercial bank pool, further exacerbating the&#13;
shortage of foreign exchange in that pool. The result is more expensive&#13;

imports at lower quantities. The increased cost of imports adversely&#13;
affects production in the sectors where there is intensive use of imported&#13;
inermediates and where substitution possibilities are limied. At the same&#13;
time, the price increase in agriculture affords a larger supply to the&#13;
domestic market through both greater output and lower exports. Public&#13;
agriculture therefore competes with private agriculture, exerting a downward&#13;
pressure on prices. This latter effect, jointly with the cost increases,&#13;
hurts the private sector and leads to a contraction in income.&#13;
The improvement in the finances of the public sector is the outcome&#13;
of lower subsidies and increased revenues. Two categories of subsidies are&#13;
distinguished in MISR2; those generated by the trading activities of.&#13;
government agencies, and those directly linked to the level of activity in&#13;
various sectors. The contraction in the economy contributes to a reduction&#13;
in the value of the subsidies as follows: (1) the government trading&#13;
agencies face relatively lower prices for output from private sector food&#13;
processing, which reduces their outlays; and (2) other subsidies decline as&#13;
a result of the lower level of activity in the economy. Higher government&#13;
revenue results mainly from the improved profitability of the agricultural&#13;
sector, induced by the price increase. Indeed, raising the output price&#13;
causes a notable outward shift in the marginal productivity schedules of the&#13;
fixed factors, labor capital and land. For the latter two, the implication&#13;
is a direct increase in income whereas for labor the price increase reduces&#13;
the negative rent imposed by the fixed wage bill.lO/&#13;
Consider now the effects of the price increase on distortions.&#13;
Table 3.3, column 1 presents the elasticities of the ratio of rents to GDP.&#13;
10/ In addition, higher import premia feed public sector revenues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Government agencies supply households with certain amounts of agricultural&#13;
and industrial goods as well as processed food at subsidized prices. The&#13;
quantities available are represented in Figure 2.1B as qd; they are&#13;
supplied at the subsidized price p. Given their demand schedule at D,&#13;
households will be willing to pay the virtual price Pv . The adverse&#13;
effects of the increase in the output price of public sector agriculture&#13;
cause curve D to shift inwards, reducing the virtual price and the implied&#13;
rent. The fall in the latter is larger than that in GDP, leading to an&#13;
alleviation of the distortions in the markets considered. Similarly, as&#13;
mentioned earlier, the increase in the output price shifts the marginal&#13;
products of labor in public agriculture outwards. Such a shift closes the&#13;
gap between the virtual and actual wage, reducing the level of distortion.&#13;
The reduction in the distortion in the markets faced by the supply-driven&#13;
sectors also results from the contraction of income in the economy, which&#13;
shifts domestic demand inwards, again reducing the gap between virtual and&#13;
market prices.&#13;
In the case of the demand-driven sectors, the distortions are&#13;
exacerbated. These sectors essentially produce non-tradables whose relative&#13;
prices are now lower after the induced increase in the cost of imports.&#13;
Consequently the sectors face additional demand and their output expands.&#13;
The expansion widens the gap between their marginal costs and the regulated&#13;
price they face, leading to more distortions. Finally, raising the output&#13;
price in public agriculture increases the rents associated with the&#13;
rationing of imports. Indeed, foreign exchange in both the central and&#13;
commercial bank pools becomes less available, contributing to more rationing&#13;
and to a larger wedge between the opportunity cost of imports and their&#13;
actual price.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Food Processing&#13;
Consider now an increase in the output price of public sector food&#13;
processing. It has the same overall contractionary effect as does raising&#13;
the price of agriculture: GDP and all its components are adversely affected&#13;
(see Table 3.3, column 2). However, in contrast with agriculture, and&#13;
despite of an increase in government revenues, the fiscal gap widens.&#13;
Similarly, the rural real wage, urban and rural consumer price indexes&#13;
(CPIs) and employment increase. The results on distortions are mostly&#13;
similar to the ones produced by the price increase in agriculture, except in&#13;
the case of the rent accruing to rural households, which increases as a&#13;
share of GDP.&#13;
The contraction of the economy comes about in the same way as&#13;
previously, but with some minor modifications. Exports of processed food&#13;
are assumed to go through the parallel market. Hence, in the first round&#13;
the availability of foreign exchange in either the central or commercial&#13;
bank pools is not affected. The parallel market exchange rate depreciates,&#13;
leading in subsequent rounds to a decline in the share of workers'&#13;
remittances going to the commercial bank pool. As a consequence, imports in&#13;
that pool are cut back. Again, because imports are more expensive and less&#13;
available, marginal costs and production are adversely affected. In the&#13;
case of public processed food, however, unlike with agriculture, the higher&#13;
cost of imports is not sufficient to wipe out the incentive resulting from&#13;
the price increase. Production expands, generat,ing more demand for domestic&#13;
intermediates, which come from private agriculture. The expansion of the&#13;
latter sector pulls rural wages up. Because of trade margins and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
non-tradable nature of their output, the public and private service sectors&#13;
expand, pulling more labor into the economy. One outcome of the increase in&#13;
the price of public sector ood processing is thus to shift the distribution&#13;
of income in favor of rural areas.&#13;
One purpose of the increases in public sector prices is to improve&#13;
public finances. This outcome does not seem to result from raising the&#13;
price of food processing. Indeed, direct taxes fall and subsidies&#13;
increase. The decline in direct taxes is induced by the shift of incomes&#13;
toward rural households, whose effective tax rate is lower. Similarly, the&#13;
relative increase in the cost of processed food in the economy while&#13;
maintaining the same subsidized price adds to the burden of government&#13;
trading and pushes up the value of subsidies. Overall, in spite of the&#13;
increase in indirect taxes, the fiscal gap widens.&#13;
In terms of distortions (see Table 3.4), column 2), the outcome of&#13;
raising the price of food processing is similar to that form agriculture,&#13;
with one exception: the share in GDP of the rent accruing to rural&#13;
households increases. The expansion of public sector food processing boosts&#13;
private agriculture, leading to increased real rural income. The&#13;
consequence is an outward shift in rural household demand which raises the&#13;
virtual price of the rationed goods available to them.&#13;
Textiles&#13;
An increase in the output prices of the textiles sector has the&#13;
same contractionary effect a8s an increase in the price of food processing&#13;
(Table 3.3, column 3). The parallel market exchange rate depreciates,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
through to a lesser degree and employment expands. The real rural wage,&#13;
howver, declines, and the fiscal gap improves. Another difference with food&#13;
processing is found in the decline of the share in GDP of rents accruing to&#13;
rural households. Unlike food processing, but as with all other sectors,&#13;
textiles have a weak link with private agriculture and hence do not exert&#13;
the pull required to increase the real rural wage. The improvement in the&#13;
fiscal gap is mainly the outcome of the improved profitability of the&#13;
textile sector and lower increase in subsidies. Indeed, the increase in the&#13;
price of textiles output, as in the case of the other sectors, improves the&#13;
marginal productivities of the fixed factors, labor and capital. With the&#13;
former, this improvement is translated into a lower negiative rent as a&#13;
result of the fixed wage bill; in the case of capital, it implies a higher&#13;
rate of return. Together these two elements enlarge the savings of public&#13;
companies and reduce the fiscal gap. Finally, because rural wages and&#13;
income are not expanding, there is less rural consumption on the rationed&#13;
goods. Their virtual price declines, and the level of distortion introduced&#13;
by the rationing of households is diminished (see Table 3.4, column 3).&#13;
Other Industry&#13;
By comparison with other sectors, an increase in the prices of&#13;
other industry sector produces much larger effects (see Table 3.3 and 3.4,&#13;
columns 4). They are, however, mainly in the same direction: a contraction&#13;
of the economy, depreciation of the parallel market exchange rate, and&#13;
improvement in the fiscal gap. This price increase also produces a relative&#13;
price change that makes the bundle of goods purchased by the government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
relatively less expensive. Hence, there is a slight increase in real public&#13;
consumption. In terms of distortions, the same pattern as for textiles is&#13;
obtained: distortions are alleviated everywhere except in the markets for&#13;
the demand-driven sectors and for imports.&#13;
Transportation and Communications&#13;
The macroeconomic response of the economy to an increase in the&#13;
price of transportation and communications follows the same pattern as the&#13;
one obtained with other industry (see Table 3.3, column 8). One difference,&#13;
however, is that the exports of transportation and communications go through&#13;
the commercial bank pool of foreign exchange. The increase in the output&#13;
price of the sector has therefore a stronger negative impact on exports and&#13;
imports. Indeed, the fixed commercial bank exchange rate does not have the&#13;
dampening effect on the decline of exports that the flexible parallel market&#13;
exchange rate has on the exports of the three industrial sectors.&#13;
Similarly, the resulting lower availability of foreign exchange in the&#13;
commercial bank pool leads to a more important cut in imports. Another&#13;
difference with the commodity-producing sectors is the decline in the&#13;
revenues of the government. This is caused mainly by a decline in the&#13;
collection of indirect taxes. Two reasons underlie the decline: (1) the&#13;
general contraction of the economy; and (2) on the one hand, the low share&#13;
of indirect taxes on services in total indirect taxes and, on the other&#13;
hand, the induced relative expansion of the service sectors. Finally,&#13;
because of the increase in the cost of imports relative to that of domestic&#13;
goods, and because of the higher domestic intensity of the intermediates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
used in the service sector, there is a relative decline in the marginal cost&#13;
of the latter. In spite of the expansion of the public service sector, that&#13;
decline alleviates the distortions for the demand-driven sectors (see Table&#13;
3.4, column 8).&#13;
2.b Supply-Driven Sectors Producing Non-Tradables&#13;
One essential feature of the construction sector is that its output&#13;
is non-tradable. It is assumed in MISR2 to be facing a regulated price and&#13;
to maximize its profits at that price. There is no demand for exports, and&#13;
domestic users are rationed. Raising the price of construction produces a&#13;
significantly different result from increases in the prices of other&#13;
sectors: the contraction of the economy is almost negligible and is only&#13;
the result of a decline in private consumption (see Table 3.3, column 6).&#13;
Most other results, however, are similar to the ones obtained by raising the&#13;
regulated prices of the other supply-driven sectors. The finances of the&#13;
public sector improve; the parallel market exchange rate depreciates. All&#13;
distortions except those attributable to the rationing of imports are&#13;
alleviated. The increase in the price of public sector construction does&#13;
not directly affect exports as the sector produces non-tradables.&#13;
Two effects that work in opposite directions are generated. On the&#13;
one hand, an expansion in the output of construction drives its relative&#13;
cost down. On the other hand, the expansion means a larger demand for&#13;
intermediates, which pulls up some prices and contributes to the&#13;
depreciation of the parallel market exchange rate through more imports. The&#13;
cost-push elements reduce output in some sectors, while the demand-pull&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
elements expand output in others. The private sectors except other industry&#13;
are more affected by the cost-push developments: the contraction of their&#13;
output affects private income and consumption, which decline. Apart from&#13;
construction and the demand-driven sectors, the levels of activity of all&#13;
other public sectors depend on variations in their costs. Only food&#13;
processing and transportation and communications see a decline in their&#13;
relative costs and an expansion in their output. On balance, however, the&#13;
savings of the public companies improve. Because the relative costs of&#13;
public consumption and public investment decline, and because they are&#13;
budgeted for in nominal terms, their real values increase. The expansionary&#13;
factors are sufficient to pull more imports into the economy, causing a&#13;
depreciation in the parallel market exchange rate. By adding more resources&#13;
in domestic currency to the pool of private savings, the depreciation,&#13;
together with the relatively lower cost of investment goods, contributes to&#13;
an increase in real private investment. Simultaneously, the depreciation&#13;
improves the competitiveness of the economy and export's of non-agricultural&#13;
commodities expand. More oil is also exported because of the contraction of&#13;
private consumption.&#13;
The revenue of the government grows, mainly because it collects&#13;
more tariffs on imports, which contribute to the expansion of indirect&#13;
taxes. A less significant addition to government revenue comes from the&#13;
improved profitability of public sector construction. The slowdown of the&#13;
private economy adversely affects direct taxes. Simultaneously, the lower&#13;
price of private food processing diminishes the cost to the government&#13;
trading agencies, and subsidies decline. Overall, as for all other public&#13;
sector production activities except food processing, the fiscal gap is&#13;
reduced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
Naturally, the contraction of private consumption reduces the&#13;
relative virtual prices of rationed goods. It reduces the wedge between the&#13;
opportunity cost and the market price of the specific goods and consequently&#13;
alleviates distortions there (see Table 3.4, column 6). With respect to&#13;
employment, the increase in the price of public construction improves the&#13;
marginal productivity of labor in the sector and diminishes the level of&#13;
distortion. The improvement is sufficient to reduce the ratio to GDP of the&#13;
negative rents imposed on the public sector by the fixed wage bill. By&#13;
expanding supply, the increase in the price of construction reduces its&#13;
scarcity value and closes the gap between its opportunity cost and market&#13;
value; the supply-driven sectors on the whole face less distortion. By&#13;
contrast with the result obtained for the other price increases, the&#13;
demand-driven sectors are also favorably affected by the higher price of&#13;
construction. The demand they face contracts more than the expansion of&#13;
their costs; the gap between their marginal cost and their regulated prices&#13;
closes. Finally, the additional demand for imports exacerbates their&#13;
scarcity, and the premia associated with imports increase.&#13;
2.c The Demand-Driven Sectors&#13;
Electricity and services are assumed to be demand-driven: they&#13;
face a regulated price and their supply adjusts to meet demand. If the&#13;
latter happens to be beyond the amount that would allow them to maximize&#13;
their profits, they incur a negative rent; if, on the contrary, demand is&#13;
below the maximum profit level of output, they receive a pure rent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
Electricity&#13;
The electricity sector produces a non-tradable. Because of the&#13;
relatively small level of the output of electricity, raising its price has&#13;
relatively minor effects on the rest of the economy (see Tables 3.3 and 3.9,&#13;
columns 5). However, it does depress the demand for electricity and its&#13;
level of activity. It also contributes to a slightly increased domestic&#13;
demand for oil, which adversely affects the exports of the central bank&#13;
pool. The additional foreign exchange required in that pool needs to be&#13;
bought from the commercial bank pool, leading to a tighter foreign exchange&#13;
budget there. This latter effect, combined with the general contraction of&#13;
the economy, results in a drop in imports. However, relative price changes&#13;
are such as to reduce the cost of the bundle of goods required for public&#13;
investment, thus contributing to a real increase in public sector capital&#13;
formation.&#13;
As with the price increases in most other sectors, the fiscal gap&#13;
narrows. On the revenue side, the main sources of improvement are the&#13;
higher direct taxes and savings of public companies. The better performance&#13;
of these two resides mainly in the increased profitability of electricity,&#13;
which improves the income of public companies. On the expenditure side, the&#13;
price of electricity has a depressing effect that helps reduce the level of&#13;
subsidies. On the one hand, the subsidies linked to the level of activity&#13;
of various sectors decline, and, on the other, the relatively lower price of&#13;
private food processing reduces the cost to the government of food&#13;
subsidies. Overall the fiscal gap narrows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
The effects on the distortions are as expected. All of them except&#13;
for those associated with imports are alleviated. The rents accruing to&#13;
households fall because of reduced income; the negative rents caused by the&#13;
fixed wage bills shrink, following the higher marginal productivity of labor&#13;
in electricity; the contraction of the economy diminishes the scarcity value&#13;
of the goods produced by the supply-driven sectors; while the reduced wedge&#13;
between the marginal cost and market price of electricity lowers the level&#13;
of distortion for the demand-driven sectors. However, the slight reduction&#13;
in exports, by reducing the availability of foreign exchange and forcing a&#13;
cut in imports, contributes to higher import premia.&#13;
Services&#13;
The other demand-driven sector is services. The same pattern of&#13;
results is produced by raising the price of electricity, although the&#13;
effects are more important because the sector is larger (see Tables 3.3 and&#13;
3.4, columns 9). Another difference with the electricity sector is that a&#13;
small amount of the output of services is exported. Thus an increase in the&#13;
price of services dampens both domestic and foreign demand. The reduced&#13;
exports of services, which go through the commercial bank pool, reduce the&#13;
foreign exchange there. Imports financed via the commercial banks are&#13;
therefore cut, and some imports spill over to the parallel market, leading&#13;
to the depreciation of the exchange rate, which helps, albeit not&#13;
sufficiently, exports of non-agricultural commodities. On balance, the&#13;
outcome is fewer and more costly imports, as well as less exports. These&#13;
latter two effects contribute to a slackening of the economy. Thus, there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
is a reduction in absorption and a switch from foreign to domestic demand.&#13;
However, the switch is not sufficient to compensate for the cut in&#13;
absorption. The end result is a reduction in private sector activity except&#13;
for private services. The latter receive some of the demand switched out of&#13;
the public sector. At the same time, some public sector activities emerge&#13;
with better relative prices and expand their production, although only to a&#13;
limited extent. As a result of the relative price changes, the costs of&#13;
public consumption and investment are reduced, and these two components of&#13;
aggregate demand expand in real terms.&#13;
Public finances improve in the same way as in the other sectors.&#13;
The cost of subsidized goods is relatively lower through the depressed price&#13;
of private food processing; the savings of public companies and the direct&#13;
taxes they pay are larger because of greater profitability. The overall&#13;
fiscal gap is reduced.&#13;
The results of the increase in the price of services is similar in&#13;
terms of distortions to the one obtained for electricity and for the same&#13;
reasons. However, the distortions in the output market in the demand-driven&#13;
sectors are reduced substantially as the gap between marginal cost and&#13;
regulated price is reduced by quite a lot.&#13;
2.d Oil&#13;
Rarely has the Egyptian economy traditionally resource-constrained,&#13;
had an opportunity such as the one oil is providing. The problem is to&#13;
exploit the opportunity in the most favorable way. The long-run issues of&#13;
the investment strategy posed by oil are treated very well in Dervis, et&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
al., (1983). In the short- to medium-run, the question is the pricing of&#13;
oil and the effect of bringing the domestic price to the world level. The&#13;
implication of raising the domestic price within a year is considered here&#13;
(see Tables 3.3 and 3.4, columns 7).&#13;
Unlike with all the other sectors, raising the price of oil&#13;
increases GDP at constant market prices. The only negative effect is borne&#13;
by private consumption, and it is not substantial. The primary effect of&#13;
raising the price of oil is to expand oil exports through a cut in domestic&#13;
consumption. The additional foreign exchange available to the central bank&#13;
pool, through which oil is exported, releases more foreign exchange to the&#13;
commercial banks. In turn, the larger availability of foreign exchange in&#13;
the latter pool allows for more imports and less spillover to the parallel&#13;
market. As a result, the parallel exchange rate appreciates. The outcome&#13;
is more and less costly imports. Simultaneously, the appreciation of the&#13;
parallel rate hurts exports of non-agricultural commodities going through&#13;
that pool, where transactions are governed by that rate. The slack in the&#13;
export demand on the one hand expands the supply from the public sector to&#13;
the domestic market, and on the other depresses the demand faced by the&#13;
private sector. The adverse shift in the private sector demand results in&#13;
lower relative prices there. Given the appreciation of the exchange rate,&#13;
the lowering of prices in the private sector reduces the relative cost of&#13;
investment goods and the bundle of commodities for public consumption.&#13;
These components of aggregate demand increase in real terms and more than&#13;
compensate for the decline in private consumption.&#13;
The expected positive effect of the increase in oil prices on&#13;
public finances is obtained. The main reason is the improved performance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
the oil sector, which generates more operating surplus, contributing to more&#13;
public sector savings. However, at the same time the contraction of the&#13;
private economy adjusting to the increased costs of energy leads to a&#13;
decline in direct taxes. However, indirect taxes, following the expansion&#13;
of all the non-private consumption components of GDP, increase.     For the&#13;
same reason, the level of subsidies is also higher.    Overall the improved&#13;
operating surplus in the oil sector is the dominant effect, leading to a&#13;
reduction in the fiscal gap.&#13;
The decline in private income and consumption underlies the lower&#13;
shares of rents accruing to households because of the subsidization of&#13;
certain goods. Indeed, the reduced income leads to an inward shift in the&#13;
demand curves, which produces relatively lower virtual prices: the level of&#13;
distortion is reduced. As with the price increases in other sectors, the&#13;
distortions resulting from the fixed wage bill are alleviated, although&#13;
through different channels. The increase in the price of oil adversely&#13;
affects the private sector and leads to a relative drop in output prices&#13;
there. This latter effect, jointly with the appreciation of the parallel&#13;
market exchange rate and the fixed prices in the public sector, implies&#13;
lower marginal costs and higher levels of output in the public sector. As a&#13;
consequence, the scarcity value of labor rises implying less distortion. By&#13;
the same mechanism, the expansion of activity in the public sector relaxes&#13;
the rationing of domestic markets in the supply-driven sectors, implying a&#13;
reduction in the level of distortion there as well. By contrast, however,&#13;
the gap between opportunity cost and market prices in the demand-driven&#13;
sectors widens. Indeed, the expansion of the public commodity sectors&#13;
implies, through trade margins, a larger demand and output in public sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
services. That output is supplied at the same regulated price but at a&#13;
higher marginal cost. Finally, as can be expected, the share of import&#13;
premia in GDP declines:   the larger amounts of oil exported make more&#13;
foreign exchange available and relax the import budget through the&#13;
commercial bank pool.&#13;
III.3 Aggregate Demand Policies&#13;
The general conclusion emanating from this discussion is that an&#13;
increase in public sector prices tends, in the short run, to contract the&#13;
economy. This conclusion is, however, based on the premise that no other&#13;
policy is implemented simultaneously: public prices are increased without&#13;
the government changing its policies on domestic and foreign borrowing. If&#13;
a contraction of the economy were anticipated, it is likely the government&#13;
would implement, jointly with the price increases, polices aimed at&#13;
containing the contraction, if not at maintaining the level of activity.&#13;
Four policies directed toward such an outcome are examined here.&#13;
In the first, public companies increase their level of investment, while in&#13;
the second, a lower share of private funds is channeled to the public&#13;
sector. In other words, the public sector borrows less from the private&#13;
sector. The two other policies are related to transactions with the rest of&#13;
the world. One calls for more foreign borrowing through the commercial bank&#13;
pool, with the purpose of alleviating the burden of the increased public&#13;
sector investment outlays on domestic funds. The last policy is a&#13;
devaluation of the commercial bank exchange rate in order to contain the&#13;
adverse effect of the price increases on the exports passing through this&#13;
pool. These four policies are considered first independently and then in&#13;
combination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
3.a Public Investment Outlays&#13;
Columns 1 of Table's 3.5 and 3.6 give selected indicators measuring&#13;
the effect of a 1 percent increase in investment by the public sector. GDP&#13;
at constant market prices increases, as do private consumption and exports.&#13;
Real public sector investment shows a relatively minor gain. All other&#13;
components of real GDP are adversely affected. The level of employment&#13;
improves while the parallel market exchange rate depreciates. In spite of a&#13;
nominal increase in the rural wage, it declines in real terms. The fiscal&#13;
gap worsens. Distortions are exacerbated. The increased public sector&#13;
investment has two effects, higher aggregate demand and excess demand for&#13;
funds.&#13;
The higher aggregate demand can only be accommodated through&#13;
supplies from the private sector, the demand-driven public sectors and&#13;
imports. The other public sectors, which are supply-driven, cannot expand&#13;
their supply. The larger demand faced by the private sectors directly, or&#13;
indirectly through the expansion of the demand-driven public sectors, puts&#13;
pressure on private sector prices, which show a relative increase.&#13;
Similarly, the initial larger demand for imports leads to a depreciation in&#13;
the parallel market exchange rate. That latter effect partially shifts&#13;
workers' remittances out of the commercial bank pool and increases the costs&#13;
of imports. These two effects dampen the demand for imports, which&#13;
ultimately decline. However, the depreciation has the advantage of helping&#13;
non-agricultural commodity exports, which pass through the parallel market.&#13;
The relatively higher costs of imports and private sector goods have an&#13;
adverse effect on the public sector, which cannot adjust its output prices.&#13;

adjust its output prices. Besides the level of activity in the public&#13;
sector, the components of GDP defined in nominal terms show a decline. The&#13;
increase in investment by the public sector allows it to keep ahead of the&#13;
price increases and produces a relatively weak expansion in real public&#13;
investment.&#13;
The other aspect of greater investment by the public sector is an&#13;
excess demand for funds at the macroeconomic level. The gap leads to three&#13;
types of adjustments. The initial increase in aggregate demand generates&#13;
more income by expanding essentially private sector activities.&#13;
Simultaneously, the depreciation of the parallel market exchange rate&#13;
increases the domestic currency value of foreign savings. The latter two&#13;
effects, by raising prices in the domestic economy, cut the real value of all&#13;
nominally fixed magnitudes and, in particular, public sector investment&#13;
expenditures. Thus the economy tries to accommodate the additional&#13;
investment expenditure by increasing the level of activity. However, it&#13;
rapidly faces resource constraints that raise private sector prices and the&#13;
cost of foreign goods. The expansion becomes more and more costly. In the&#13;
process the real value of nominally fixed magnitudes declines.&#13;
The changes in the distortion indicators shown in column I of Table&#13;
3.6 follow from the expansion of the private economy, the contraction of the&#13;
public sector and the deterioration in the foreign accounts. The increased&#13;
share in GDP of the rents accruing to households is based on the expansion of&#13;
their income. Indeed, the expansion in income leads to outward shifts in&#13;
household demand that generate a relative increase in virtual prices. Hence,.&#13;
the gap between the opportunity cost and subsidized value of the rationed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
goods grows larger. The greater negative rent attributable to the fixed wage&#13;
bill in the public sector results from the contraction of output there. The&#13;
latter causes inward shifts in the marginal productivity of labor schedules,&#13;
driving virtual wages down and further away from the regulated wages. The&#13;
substantially higher rents occurring in the markets of goods produced by the&#13;
supply-driven sectors result from both the expansion of aggregate demand and&#13;
the contraction of public sector outputs. Indeed, these two developments&#13;
exacerbate the scarcity of the goods produced by these sectors and hence&#13;
increase their virtual costs. The larger share in GDP of the negative rents&#13;
generated in the markets of the outputs of the demand-driven sectors are the&#13;
result of the increases in their marginal costs. Finally, the tighter&#13;
availability of foreign exchange in the commercial bank pool implies a more&#13;
binding rationing of imports that increases their scarcity value.&#13;
On balance, in the absence of other policies, an expansion of&#13;
investment by the public sector leads to higher GDP at constant market&#13;
prices. This outcome results from simultaneously higher and lower levels of&#13;
activity in the private and public sectors, respectively. Hence, in the&#13;
short run, the additional investment barely increases. Public sector&#13;
consumption in real terms declines.&#13;
3.b Less borrowing from the Private Sector&#13;
One important reason for raising public sector prices is to improve&#13;
the mobilization of public resources. If that is the expected outcome, then&#13;
there is less need for the public sector to borrow funds from the private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
sector. This section considers the short-run macroeconomic consequences of&#13;
reducing the share of private resources channeled to the public sector, in&#13;
the absence of any other intervention.&#13;
Column 2 of Table 3.5 provides the percentage changes in selected&#13;
macroeconomic indicators in response to a 1 percent decline in the share of&#13;
private funds channeled to the public sector. That change has two initial&#13;
effects. On the one hand, more resources are available for private sector&#13;
investment, and on the other there is excess demand for funds in the public&#13;
sector. These two effects work in the same direction and affect the economy&#13;
through the same channels as does the increase in investment by the public&#13;
sector considered above. Private sector prices show a relative increase; the&#13;
parallel market exchange rate depreciates. As a consequence, private sector&#13;
output expands, while the level of activity in the public sector declines&#13;
because of higher costs and unchanged output prices. Most indicators move in&#13;
the same direction as with the increase in public sector investment&#13;
expenditures. One expected difference is the increase and decline in real&#13;
private and public investment respectively. The relative increase in&#13;
investment prices is not sufficient to offset the higher investment&#13;
expenditure by the private sector. The fixed public sector investment budget&#13;
absorbs the increase in investment prices through a decline in real&#13;
investment. Another result that is different by comparison with what larger&#13;
public sector investment produces is the lower fiscal gap. Where there is&#13;
investment, some financing is obtained from the private sector through the&#13;
expansion of its resources in the latter does not offset the decline in the&#13;
share of these resources channeled to the public sector. Instead, borrowing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
from the private sector is replaced by the resources of the public sector&#13;
itself. However, this shift is obtained at the cost of relatively higher&#13;
investment prices that reduce the real value of public sector investment.&#13;
The effects on distortions, as shown in column 2 of Table 3.6, are&#13;
identical to the ones produced by the increase in public sector investment.&#13;
The expansion of the economy in the face of limited resources and rationing&#13;
exacerbates the distortions.&#13;
3.c Additional Foreign Borrowing&#13;
Raising public sector prices tends to reduce the fiscal gap,&#13;
generating resources for the public sector. If nothing is done with these&#13;
resources and no other policy is adopted, the economy contracts. In order to&#13;
avoid the contraction and help an eventual restructuring of the public&#13;
sector, the additional resources can be used to finance increased investment&#13;
by public companies. However, the domestically generated resources may not&#13;
be sufficient for the higher level of investment, especially if the public&#13;
sector also reduces its borrowing from the private sector. A short-run&#13;
solution is to raise the level of foreign borrowing to smooth the&#13;
adjustment. In order to disentangle the effects of the higher foreign&#13;
borrowing from those of the other elements of the package of policy measures,&#13;
the response of the economy to an increase in the amount of foreign borrowing&#13;
through the commercial bank pool, to the exclusion of any other policy, is&#13;
considered here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Column 3 of Table 3.5 presents the changes in selected indicators&#13;
following a 1 percent increase in foreign borrowing through the commercial&#13;
bank pool. GDP at constant market prices and all its components apart from&#13;
exports expand. The parallel market exchange rate appreciates, while the&#13;
real rural wage increases. Public sector revenues decline, and the fiscal&#13;
gap widens.&#13;
If the public sector engages in more foreign borrowing, the initial&#13;
consequence is an excess supply of resources at the macroeconomic level. In&#13;
the absence of other interventions, the nominal level of income needs to&#13;
drop. But the costs to domestic users decline even more relative to world&#13;
prices, allowing for an expansion of the level of activity. The larger&#13;
availability of foreign exchange in the commercial bank pool means a larger&#13;
inflow of cheaper imports and less recourse to the parallel market, implying&#13;
an appreciation of the exchange rate there. This effect is further&#13;
accentuated by a shift of workers' remittances out of the parallel market&#13;
into the commercial bank pool because of the appreciation.     The latter shift&#13;
and a lower cost of imports relax the cost pressures and lead to expansion of&#13;
output in both the public and private sectors. The larger supplies in the&#13;
economy drive prices in the private sector down implying a lower expansion of&#13;
output there than in the public sector, whose prices are fixed. Now imports&#13;
and private sector goods are relatively less expensive. Hence all&#13;
expenditures fixed in nominal terms, in particular public consumption and&#13;
investment, have a higher real value. As to outcomes, exports decline&#13;
because of the appreciation of the parallel market exchange rate on the one&#13;
hand and the real expansion of the economy on the other. The former has an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
adverse effect on the exports of non-agricultural commodities assumed to pass&#13;
through the parallel market, while the expansion creates a larger domestic&#13;
demand for oil and contracts the exportable surplus.&#13;
The additional foreign borrowing does not benefit domestic resource&#13;
mobilization in the publc sector: the main sources of revenues decline.&#13;
Moreover, despite the reduction in the value of the subsidies, this situation&#13;
induces a deterioration in the fiscal gap. Direct and indirect taxes as well&#13;
as most revenues of the government are pegged to nominal income. Following&#13;
the increased foreign borrowing, the latter contract, decreasing public&#13;
sector revenues. In particular, the public sector no longer receives the&#13;
import premia, which decline as a result of the larger availability of&#13;
foreign exchange and less binding rationing of imports. Given that no change&#13;
occurs in the current consumption of the government and in public sector&#13;
investment, the fiscal gap widens.&#13;
The short-run effects on distortions of a 1 percent increase in&#13;
foreign borrowing are shown in column 3 of Table 3.6, which presents the&#13;
implied percentage change in the ratio of the specific rent to GDP. Because&#13;
of the positive elasticity of demand with respect to income and the lower&#13;
levels of income, the ratios of household rents to GDP decline, reducing the&#13;
level of distortion. On the employment side, firms in the public sector&#13;
benefit from their regulated prices and the lower costs of imports and&#13;
private sector goods. As a result, their output expands, contributing to&#13;
relatively higher virtual wages: the negative rent attributable to the fixed&#13;
wage bill declines. Similarly, distortions in the markets of the outputs of&#13;
the supply-driven sectors are also alleviated because of the expansion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
outputs, which reduces the level of rationing in these markets. As can be&#13;
expected, the expansion of output in the demand-driven sectors enlarges the&#13;
gap between their marginal cost and the price they receive, implying a wider&#13;
difference between opportunity costs and market prices. Finally, the larger&#13;
availability of foreign exchange, by alleviating the rationing, also reduces&#13;
the share of import premia in GDP.&#13;
3.d Devaluation of the Commercial Bank Exchange Rate&#13;
The last instrument in the policy package is a devaluation of the&#13;
commercial bank exchange rate. On its own, the devaluation allows an&#13;
expansion of GDP and all its components at constant market prices. However,&#13;
it also reduces government revenue and leads to a widening of the fiscal gap.&#13;
Because of the particular trade regime in Egypt, a devaluation leads&#13;
to a relative decline in import prices relative to domestic prices. Exports&#13;
passing through the commercial bank pool expand, while workers' remittances&#13;
shift out of the parallel market. The additional foreign exchange allows a&#13;
relaxation of the rationing of imports, which come in more through the&#13;
commercial bank pool, reducing the demand for imports in the parallel&#13;
market. The shift of imports between the two pools reduces the pressure on&#13;
the parallel market exchange rate, which appreciates. The appreciation and&#13;
reduced rationing allow a relative decline in import prices and a reduction&#13;
in import costs. As a consequence, the nominally fixed expenditure increase&#13;
in real terms and domestic output expands. More income is generated in the&#13;
private sector and private consumption increases. The latter benefits also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
from the higher value in domestic currency of the transfers from abroad.&#13;
Rates of return in the public sector also improve. Following the upswing in&#13;
aggregate demand, private sector prices rise.&#13;
Another aspect of the devaluation is the larger amounts of resources&#13;
available to finance public sector investment. However, lower income in the&#13;
public sector reduces this excess supply of resources, in spite of the higher&#13;
public rates of return and the expansion of the economy. This latter result&#13;
happens in two ways. On the one hand, the lessened constraint on imports&#13;
reduces import premia substantially and thus dries up an important source of&#13;
revenue for public sector companies. That reduction in import premia more&#13;
than offsets the improved rates of return. On the other hand, the larger&#13;
aggregate demand reduces the exportable surplus of oil. The income resulting&#13;
from the difference between the world and domestic prices of oil therefore&#13;
falls contributing to lower public sector revenue. On balance, the fiscal&#13;
gap widens.&#13;
As column 4 of Table 3.6 shows, the share in GDP of the rents&#13;
accruing to households increases following the expansion of private&#13;
consumption. Similarly, the higher level of activity in the economy&#13;
exacerbates the distortions in the markets of both the supply-driven and&#13;
demand-driven sectors. In the former, supply lags behind the larger&#13;
aggregate demand, thus accentuating the scarcity of public sector goods. In&#13;
the demand-driven sectors as well, demand grows faster than the decline in&#13;
marginal costs. As expected, the devaluation reduces import premia, with the&#13;
adverse consequence on public finances mentioned above. However, the&#13;
expansion of output in the public sector narrows the gap between virtual and&#13;
regulated wages.&#13;

III. 4. The Effects of the Combined Package&#13;
Policy-makers are often told that prices are out of line with&#13;
opportunity costs. Most of the time prices are too low, encouraging too much&#13;
demand, reducing efficiency and hurting resource mobilization. The&#13;
recommended solution is always to raise the uneconomic prices to the level of&#13;
their opportunity costs. The advisers are rarely concerned with the adverse&#13;
economic and eventual social and political short-run consequences of this&#13;
action. On the other hand, policy-makers are often too sensitive to the&#13;
negative effects.&#13;
A well-designed package of measures that includes price increases&#13;
and aggregate demand policies can alleviate if not avoid adverse consequences&#13;
while putting the economy on a sounder growth track.    Presumably, there are&#13;
a number of policy packages that can have the desired effects; this paper&#13;
presents one workable option. The previous sections analyzed how each policy&#13;
in the package individually would affect the economy in the short run.     The&#13;
section considers the combined effects of implementing an entire package,&#13;
assuming a 1 percent change under each policy instrument. In principle, the&#13;
scope of the change through each policy can, however, be set wherever desired.&#13;
Column 1 of Table 3.7 presents the percentage change in selected&#13;
macroeconomic indicators in response to a 1 percent increase in all public&#13;
sector prices. The predominant effect -- a contraction of the economy --&#13;
prevails. The private sector as a whole and exports decline through the&#13;
mechanisms described previously. Those two effects decrease imports and real&#13;
private investment. Relative price changes benefit public real consumption&#13;

and investment, which expand. The fiscal gap improves.&#13;
To summarize, raising public sector prices:&#13;
(1) results in a larger supply of public goods that displace private&#13;
goods, forcing their prices down;&#13;
(2) has, in varying degrees, an adverse effect on exports that&#13;
reduces the availability of foreign exchange in the commercial&#13;
bank and central bank pools;&#13;
(3) cuts the amounts of imports because of tighter rationing&#13;
attributable to the lower availability of foreign exchange and&#13;
the depreciation of the parallel market exchange rate;&#13;
(4) squeezes the private sector between declining output prices and&#13;
increasing costs of imported intermediates and public sector&#13;
goods;&#13;
(5) creates an improvement in public sector finances through higher&#13;
profitability of public sector firms and the windfall of import&#13;
premia accruing to them; and&#13;
(6) reduces most distortions in the economy except import premia.&#13;
The response of the economy to the set of aggregate demand policies&#13;
is shown in column 2 of Tables 3.7 and 3.8. Those policies cause an&#13;
expansion, with an increase in GDP and all its components, except real public&#13;
consumption and investment at constant market prices. The fiscal gap worsens&#13;
in spite of greater public sector revenues. Any additional aggregate demand&#13;
can only be satisfied by the private sector, imports or the demand-driven&#13;
public sector. Any expansion in the output of the latter also feeds the&#13;
demand for private sector goods and imports. As a consequence, private&#13;

sector prices and outputs expand, pulling private consumption, investment and&#13;
imports with them. The combination of the switching policy and the resultant&#13;
devaluation of the commercial bank exchange rate and of the absorption policy&#13;
of investment expansion leaves the parallel market exchange rate almost&#13;
unchanged. The higher public sector investment budget, lower import premia&#13;
and higher subsidy payments cause the fiscal gap to widen.&#13;
The outcome in terms of the distortions is mixed. The rents&#13;
accruing to households and the distortions in the output markets of the&#13;
public sectors increase. Distortions caused by the fixed public sector wage&#13;
bill and the rationing of imports are reduced.&#13;
The last columns of Tables 3.7 and 3.8 give the effects of the&#13;
combination of price increases and aggregate demand policies. The latter&#13;
policies reduce the adverse effects of the increases in public sector&#13;
prices. The decline in real private consumption is less pronounced, while&#13;
real public consumption is left almost unchanged. All other components of&#13;
GDP, especially investment, increase. Combining the policies results in a&#13;
lower decline in GDP without exacerbating the fiscal deficit, which increases&#13;
only slightly. Finally, most distortions are alleviated.&#13;
The following can be concluded:&#13;
(1) It is important to recognize the limited response of the public&#13;
sector and the more flexible one of the private sector.&#13;
(2) The response of the economy depends on the initial situation in&#13;
the market in which the price increases takes place; there are&#13;
supply-driven sectors in which demand is rationed, and&#13;
demand-driven sectors in which adjustment occurs more in the&#13;
operating surplus of the producers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
(3) The outcome also differs according to the nature of the&#13;
commodity produced by the sector whose price is raised; results&#13;
differ depending on the tradable or non-tradable nature of the&#13;
commodity.&#13;
(4) It is important to identify the foreign exchange pool through&#13;
which exports pass; if the exchange rate is flexible, the&#13;
eventual adverse effect on exports is less pronounced than if it&#13;
is fixed.&#13;
(5) The rationing of imports in the commercial bank pool is&#13;
significant to the response of the rest of the economy and to&#13;
the determination of the public sector gap.&#13;
(6) For each individual policy, the effects on the distortions are&#13;
mixed, although the package as a whole reduces the distortions&#13;
in almost every area.&#13;
(7) It is important to consider price increases as part of a package&#13;
of measures that include aggregate demand policies, and not as&#13;
individual price increases.&#13;

Chapter IV&#13;
THE MEDIUM TERM PERSPECTIVE OF A PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
The previous chapter analyzed the short-term--within one&#13;
year--response of the economy to individual and a combination of various&#13;
policy measures designed to improve the efficiency of the public sector in&#13;
Egypt. The main conclusion is that individual policy measures involve&#13;
trade-offs among different indicators--some improve, others deteriorate. A&#13;
combined policy package helps improve the trade-offs considerably. The&#13;
short-run adjustment costs are still there, but they are softened&#13;
significantly.&#13;
This chapter looks at the medium-term (over a period of 10 years)&#13;
response of the economy to a public sector reform program. In this&#13;
medium-term capacities expand, and wages and the supply of labor respond to&#13;
the changes in the levels of activities and allocation signals that emerge&#13;
from the the policy package. The reform is designed to be implemented over 10&#13;
years. During the first five years, the policy regime of 1983 is maintained,&#13;
but with controlled adjustment of prices, as well as implementation of&#13;
macroeconomic aggregate demand policies. The purpose is gradually to increase&#13;
public sector prices in order to reduce distortions. Beyond the fifth year,&#13;
assuming that the economy by then has acquired flexibility and the agents are&#13;
now more familiar with price changes, public sector prices are freed to&#13;
respond either to excess demand or, as with oil prices, to follow world&#13;
prices. Simultaneous to the freeing of public sector prices, transactions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
with the rest of the world are consolidated into two pool, instead of three;&#13;
the commercial bank and parallel markets for foreign exchange would be&#13;
consolidated into one market, with the exchange rate free to adjust. The&#13;
central bank is allowed to buy and sell foreign exchange from the free&#13;
market. One distortion that-remains is the difference in exchange rates&#13;
governing transactions in the two pools, i.e. the free market and the central&#13;
bank pool.&#13;
IV.1 PHASE I: MEDIUM TERM RESPONSE TO CONTROLLED ADJUSTMENTS&#13;
The policy package underlying the controlled adjustment phase&#13;
consists of the following:&#13;
(1) Increases in the prices 'of all public sector production&#13;
activities;&#13;
(2) Additional foreign borrowing to ease the adjustment process;&#13;
(3) Depreciation of the commercial bank pool exchange rate;&#13;
(4) Increased nominal investment in state enterprises to offset the&#13;
deflationary impact of raising public sector prices (demand&#13;
management);&#13;
(5) Lower borrowing of the public sector from the private sector in&#13;
view of the additional public savings generated by the pricing&#13;
reform (demand management).&#13;

l.a RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT&#13;
The growth scenario during the first five years of the reform program&#13;
is presented in Table 4.2. The overall impact of the policy package on growth&#13;
is deflationary. The decline in growth is induced by the increase in public&#13;
sector prices which reduce both overall domestic demand and demand for&#13;
exports. Policies to combat this deflationary impact, e.g., increased&#13;
investment by public companies, reduced public borrowing and depreciation of&#13;
the commercial bank exchange rate, fail to offset the deflationary effect&#13;
fully.  Reduced public borrowing enables higher private investment and&#13;
consumption and thereby offsets the adverse impact of the public sector price&#13;
increases on private demand. Nevertheless, despite the higher nominal&#13;
investment by public companies, real public investment grows more slowly than&#13;
in the reference case because of higher investment prices induced by the&#13;
exchange rate depreciation and public sector price increases (see Table 4.2).&#13;
Similarly, public consumption grows much more slowly as compared with the&#13;
reference case. On the other-hand, the depreciation of the commercial bank&#13;
exchange rate fails to offset fully the disincentive effect that increased&#13;
public sector prices have on exports. Although oil exports grow faster&#13;
because of lower domestic demand, which releases additional exportable&#13;
surplus, non-oil commodity exports still slow down. The reason is mainly the&#13;
price increases in the public sector, which lower the export demand for&#13;
price-sensitive commodities, but it is also the result of slower depreciation&#13;
in the free market exchange rate which is a key determinant of private exports.&#13;

One important factor contributing to the slower depreciation of the free&#13;
market exchange rate is the increase in official foreign borrowing which&#13;
augments the overall supply of foreign exchange in the economy despite a&#13;
slowdown in export growth. On the whole, despite a large private demand, a&#13;
slowdown in public sector demand and exports demand deflates the economy.&#13;
The savings-investment balance and fiscal indicators in the&#13;
controlled adjustment path show some improvement over the reference path (see&#13;
Tables 4.4 and 4.5). The overall fiscal deficit is lower, and total public&#13;
savings are much higher. Private saving declines as a result of a reduction&#13;
in public borrowing from the private sector. Part of the resources thus&#13;
released feeds into consumption and thereby lowers overall private savings.&#13;
The increase in public savings, however, more than offsets the decline in&#13;
private savings to yield higher overall national savings. The savings of both&#13;
public companies and government improve. The main factor contributing to&#13;
higher savings by public companies is price increases, which more than offset&#13;
the adverse consequences of a fall in import premia on the income and savings&#13;
of public companies. Government savings improve because of lower growth in&#13;
government consumption and an increase in tax revenues resulting from higher&#13;
private income and consumption. Together they cause a significant decline in&#13;
the fiscal deficit, despite higher nominal investment and higher subsidies.&#13;
An important result is that, in spite of the significant cost-push pressures,&#13;
overall inflationary pressures are reduced because of a slowdown in income&#13;
growth and a lower fiscal deficit.&#13;
A major reason the Egyptian authorities have been reluctant to adjust&#13;
public sector prices is a fear that this action would generate higher&#13;
inflation. The results indicate that the general equilibrium effects of&#13;

public sector price increases are deflationary, and not inflationary 11/.&#13;
Another improvement in the controlled adjustment scenario is that&#13;
the impact of the distortions is lower. Import premia, rents to consumers of&#13;
subsidized goods and rents in the public sector output markets are all below&#13;
levels obtaining in the reference path (see Table 4.6). The import premia&#13;
fall because of the higher total supply of foreign exchange accruing from the&#13;
additional foreign borrowing which more than offsets the impact of a slowdown&#13;
in import earnings. The share of rent accruing to households declines&#13;
because increased private investment and lower private sector real wages&#13;
expand output in the private sector, which reduces prices in the private&#13;
sector and thus lowers the gap between procurement and subsidized prices. On&#13;
the other hand, the increase in public sector prices reduces the gap between&#13;
virtual and market prices and thereby helps reduce distortions in the goods&#13;
market. Although demand management policies tend to weaken the improvement&#13;
in distortions in the goods market, the final outcome is a moderate&#13;
improvement in rent.&#13;
The distortion in the public sector employment market is, however,&#13;
aggravated somewhat. The main reason is the rigidity of employment in that&#13;
sector. Although output in the public sector contracts, employment remains&#13;
unchanged because of policy. The gap between marginal productivity and the&#13;
regulated wage increases.&#13;
11/ The model does not include an explicit monetary sector. Thus it is not&#13;
strictly valid to talk about inflation or deflation. However, the&#13;
relevance of the result that a reform of public sector pricing policy is&#13;
deflationary rather than inflationary is likely to remain valid even when&#13;
a monetary sector is introduced explicitly. A reduction in private income&#13;
will lower the demand for goods and services in the economy and thus&#13;
provide one offset to the cost-push pressures. More important, a lower&#13;
public sector budget deficit means a lower money supply which will also&#13;
contribute to the deflationary impact of a public sector pricing reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
To summarize, during the controlled adjustment phase there will be an&#13;
overall improvement in the macroeconomic balance of the economy, but the&#13;
adjustment costs in terms of lower economic growth will prevail in the medium&#13;
term. There will be some improvement in the efficiency of resource&#13;
utilization, although, again, the efficiency gains will be somewhat limited&#13;
in the medium term.&#13;

IV. 2 Phase II: Macroeconomic Trends in a Flexible Policy Environment&#13;
The main assumptions underlying the reform program in the second&#13;
phase are as follows:&#13;
(1)    Government intervention in the markets for public sector&#13;
output is eliminated. Thus, all commodity prices are now&#13;
market-determined;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
(2)    The exchange system is liberalized;, the commercial bank and&#13;
free markets are unified, and the exchange rate is left free&#13;
to be determined by demand and supply.&#13;
(3)    Government controls on public sector employment are&#13;
eliminated so that public companies are free to hire and fire&#13;
and wages are determined by the market.&#13;
To capture fully the implications of liberalization, it is assumed&#13;
that in the second phase (i) public enterprise investment is at the same&#13;
level as in the corresponding period of the reference path and (ii) foreign&#13;
borrowings are also at the same level as in the reference path.&#13;
2.a. Liberalization Experiment Results&#13;
There is substantial improvement in the overall growth prospects&#13;
(see Table 4.7). Average GDP and consumption grow by 8.4 and 7.4 percent&#13;
respectively, compared with only 4.8 and 4.4 percent in the reference path.&#13;
The two main vehicles of this growth are the surge in exports and the&#13;
improved efficiency of resource use. The liberalization measures also&#13;
eliminate many of the constraints on exports; thus, the unified exchange rate&#13;
depreciates faster than the differential between world and domestic&#13;
inflation, a situation that improves the export incentives in the economy.&#13;
At the same time, the improved efficiency of production helps lower the price&#13;
increases throughout the economy. For both reasons, that is, the exchange&#13;
rate depreciation and the lower price increases, exports expand&#13;
dramatically--by 15.0 percent compared with only 5.1 percent in the reference&#13;
path. Investment growth is virtually unchanged: private investment increases&#13;

faster, public investment advances more slowly. Further, employment growth&#13;
is also lower. The achievement of higher economic growth with a slower&#13;
increase in both investment and employment illustrates the impact of the&#13;
efficiency gains resulting from liberalization.&#13;
The dramatic improvement in growth prospects even with a slower&#13;
investment growth highlights the importance of eliminating the sources of&#13;
distortion in the Egyptian economy. In an environment riddled with major&#13;
policy induced constraints, the actual productivity of key resources, foreign&#13;
exchange, labor and capital, are much below their true levels. Consequently,&#13;
when the distortions are removed, the realized productivity gains are&#13;
substantial. The factors of production are now mobile and respond to market&#13;
signals which now better reflect true economic values. Resources move from&#13;

low productivity activities to high productivity activities enabling both&#13;
higher output and lower costs. This is the key message of the liberalization&#13;
experiment.&#13;
The savings-investment balance and the fiscal situation also improve&#13;
(see Table 4.8 and 4.9). As noted, private savings decline because of lower&#13;
public sector borrowing, but public savings improve dramatically because of&#13;
higher tax revenue induced by private sector income growth and a larger&#13;
fiscal role of the public economic sector, which is no longer financially&#13;

constrained. Public consumption and subsidies grow faster, but the increased&#13;
public sector savings induce a substantial improvement in the overall fiscal&#13;
balance. Inflationary pressures are now much reduced (see Table 4.10). The&#13;
large gains in efficiency cause a significant expansion in output, which&#13;
lowers prices in the economy, another striking result. High growth and low&#13;
inflation are both achievable targets, and, moreover, price flexibility and&#13;
low inflation are not necessarily contradictory objectives.&#13;
As expected, the bulk of the rents in the economy are eliminated&#13;
(see Table 4.11). By freeing the economy, the policy program naturally has&#13;
removed the key sources of distortions. Households do, however, continue to&#13;
derive some rent from their access to rationed goods, but the distortionary&#13;
impact is small.&#13;

To summarize, with bold initiatives involving a reform of the&#13;
pricing policy and complementary demand measures, Egypt can achieve high&#13;
rates of growth and improve the overall macroeconomic balance. The objective&#13;
of the policy reform should be to correct the distortions that have&#13;
accumulated over time because of government interventions. In the short to&#13;
medium term there will be some adjustment costs in terms of lower economic&#13;
growth. However, the gains in efficiency in the long run will create&#13;
substantial improvement in Egypt's growth prospects and strengthen its&#13;
macroeconomic balance as a whole.&#13;

Chapter V&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
Egypt's long-term growth prospects depend crucially on reform of the&#13;
numerous interventions thatrconstrain the performance of public enterprises.&#13;
The three major sources of distortions are the prevalence of multiple&#13;
exchange rates, price controls on public sector output and interventions in&#13;
public sector employment decisions. These distortions have been creating&#13;
severe inefficiencies in the utilization of resources and have limited the&#13;
ability of the public sector to generate additional resources. The&#13;
simulation results based on a detailed macroeconomic framework, MISR2, which&#13;
is designed to capture the impact of the major distortions, show that&#13;
adjusting public sector prices alone will not yield unambiguous results:&#13;
some indicators improve, others deteriorate. On the other hand, a flexible&#13;
policy environment in which most of the sources of distortions have been&#13;
removed will lead Egypt to a high growth path and improve the macroeconomic&#13;
balance.&#13;
A flexible environment that allows mobility of factors and yields&#13;
price signals which better reflect true economic values, will raise the&#13;
productivity of resources and thereby improve overall growth prospects. A&#13;
more flexible environment also improves the macroeconomic balance. The&#13;
flexibility of the exchange rate, all other prices and factors of production,&#13;
significantly improve incentives for exports, while imports fall responding&#13;
to the more realistic cost of foreign exchange. Both result in an&#13;
improvement in the balance of payments. On the other hand, the combined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
effects of larger government revenue, due to higher economic growth, and&#13;
lower subsidy expenditure, because of the elimination of price controls,&#13;
improve the fiscal situation.&#13;
Another important conclusion is that there is no logical&#13;
contradiction between price flexibility and dampening of inflationary&#13;
pressures. Price flexibility will contribute to both greater efficiency in&#13;
resource use and reduce the budget deficit by raising public savings.&#13;
Nominal aggregate demand will fall, whereas real aggregate supply will rise,&#13;
causing a decline in inflationary pressures.&#13;
It should be reiterated that although price flexibility is an&#13;
essential ingredient in a policy reform program, it has to be combined with&#13;
flexible exchange rate and public sector employment policies in order to&#13;
achieve the desired improvement in growth and macroeconomic balance.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
MISR2 is a class of economywide equilibrium models.L/ The models of&#13;
the class have the same accounting framework, behaviors 2nd technology. They&#13;
mainly differ in their systems constraints or closures - which characterize&#13;
the nature of the within-period equilibrium. These closures reflect&#13;
essentially the policy regime and institutional arrangements. Thus two models&#13;
in the MISR2 class will correspond to different policy regimes and&#13;
institutional arrangements. A comparison of two paths derived from two models&#13;
in the class will amount to compare the outcomes of alternative policy&#13;
regimes.&#13;
One model within the MISR2 class has been identified to reflect the&#13;
policy regime of early 1983.   This is the reference model from which the&#13;
reference path is derived. In the following of this appendix chapter 1&#13;
provides a non-technical presentation of the reference MISR2 model&#13;
corresponding to the policy regime prevalent around the middle of 1983. In&#13;
Chapter 2, a full description of the within-period module is given. Because&#13;
MISR2 is implemented along the Transactions-Value (TV) approach, the chapter&#13;
begins with a brief overview of the approach. Then the Social Accounting&#13;
Matrix (SAM) underlying the model is presented. Finally the TV specifications&#13;
and the systems constraints of MISR2 are provided. In Chapter 3,&#13;
modifications of the reference MISR2 model are presented. They correspond to&#13;
a change in policy regime which would make public sector prices flexibles,&#13;
market. oriented and which would unify the commercial banks and "parallel"&#13;
markets of foreign exchange.&#13;
CHAPTER 1 - The Economics of the Reference Model&#13;
A within-period general equilibrium is the outcome of two sets of&#13;
factors: (i) the independent decisions of the agents intervening in the&#13;
economy and (ii) rules which ensure the consistency of all such decisions.&#13;
What characterizes alternative policy regimes is the set of rules which impose&#13;
1/  See Blitzer, Clark and Taylor (1975) and Dervis, de Melo and Robinson&#13;
(1982). MISR2 is a class of economywide equilibrium models. All the&#13;
models in the class have the same accounting framework, behaviors and&#13;
technologies. The models in the class correspond to alternative policy&#13;
regimes. Basically MISR2 distinguishes nine production activities and two&#13;
households categories. The production activities are: Agriculture, Food-&#13;
Processing, Textiles, Other-Industry, Electricity, Construction, Oil,&#13;
Transportaton and Communication and Services. Households are separated&#13;
into rural and urban.&#13;
2/  We use alternatively "systems constraints" or "closures" to indicate the&#13;
rule imposed on each market in the economy telling how the market&#13;
clears. Thus there are closures for factor markets, product markets,&#13;
foreign exchange markets. Taylor (1978) uses closures to describe the&#13;
macroeconomic constraints in the economy. Ginsburgh and Robinson (1982)&#13;
describe the way various markets clear as system constraints. See also&#13;
Robinson (1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
the reconciliation of agents decisions. One can classify these rules into&#13;
four interdependent categories according to the markets to which they pertain&#13;
or to the price which governs transaW ions on those markets. Thus one can&#13;
identify rules related to (i) goods - markets, (ii) factor markets; (iii)&#13;
foreign exchange markets and (iv) macroeconomic equilibrium. The definition&#13;
of the rules "closing" these interdependent markets, leads to a particular&#13;
model in the MISR2 class. This model will correspond to a particular set of&#13;
institutional arrangements and to a policy regiz1e,    In the following we review&#13;
the rules corresponding to the reference model. 'L /i&#13;
1. The Goods Markets&#13;
There are two sets of goods markets.    In the first set, goods are&#13;
traded between "original suppliers" and "traders." In the second set the&#13;
trade takes place between "traders" and "final users."     The two sets of&#13;
markets are considered successively in the following.&#13;
1.1 From Original Suppliers to Traders&#13;
Original suppliers are domestic and foreign producers. In the MISR2&#13;
class of models, in order to reflect conditions in the Egyptian economy, there&#13;
are public and private domestic producers.    Similarly, foreign suppliers are&#13;
classified into three categories, depending on the foreign exchange pool used&#13;
to bring the imports into the country. The three foreign exchange pools&#13;
are: (i) the central bank, (ii) the commercial banks and (iii) the parallel&#13;
market. Thus over-all there are two domestic, plus three foreign sources of&#13;
supply of goods. They are represented in the rows of Table 3.1.&#13;
Traders are represented in the columns of Table 3.1. They undertake&#13;
one of the three following activities: (i) domestic trade, exchanging&#13;
domestically produced goods on domestic markets; (ii) export and (iii)&#13;
import. Again to reflect conditions in Egypt in early 1983, each of these&#13;
activities is separated into two, depending on the existence or absence of&#13;
regulations governing the activity. There are thus six categories of&#13;
traders. In the following we consider first trade between domestic suppliers&#13;
and traders and then trade between foreign suppliers and traders.&#13;
1/ "Goods" is used here in a loose way to denote goods and non-factor&#13;
services.&#13;
2/ For the inter-period linkages, see appendix 2.&#13;
3/ There is an expanding literature on "closing rules" analyzing the&#13;
implications of alternative closures. Whereas this literature sheds light&#13;
on some of the issues involved, it has a major drawback in that all&#13;
discussions on closures depend in an essential way on the initial model&#13;
framework the analyst starts with. This point appears clearly when one&#13;
compares the discussion in Lysy (1983) and in Dewatripont and Michel&#13;
(1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.1.1 From Domestic Suppliers to Traders&#13;
Each row of Table 3.1!/ corresponds to a market where trade takes&#13;
place between an original supplier and traders. The first nine lines refer to&#13;
goods and services produced by public sector activities. These markets are&#13;
characterized by fixed prices: prices faced by public sector activities are&#13;
administered and used as policy instruments. The question which then arises&#13;
is that of the clearing of these markets.&#13;
For all markets, except those for electricity, oil, and services, the&#13;
clearing rule is described in Figure 3.1. In panel A, the supply curve is at&#13;
S, and the administered price at p, leading to a level of supply at q which&#13;
needs to be allocated between traders.    In panel B, the demand curve for all2,&#13;
traders, except those concerned with domestic trade on unregulated markets, -&#13;
is at ED, leading to a level of their demand at qe. Domestic traders on&#13;
unregulated markets obtain q - qe. In terms of goods produced by public&#13;
sector activities, these traders are rationed. The rule described in Figure&#13;
3.1 corresponds to a situation where prices are fixed and supplies are&#13;
limited; demand has to adjust.   In this situation, an adjustment in the price&#13;
p, say upwards, will have as first effects: (i) an expansion of supply; (ii)&#13;
a dampening of export and regulated domestic demand, and (iii) a lower&#13;
rationing of non-regulated domestic demand. Of course these responses will&#13;
depend on the elasticities of the curves S and ED. The specification of&#13;
Figure 3.1 is adopted here to reflect the view that there are limitations on&#13;
supply in the markets concerned. For instance, the supplies of public means&#13;
of transportation, publicly produced industrial and agricultural goods are&#13;
considered to be limited.&#13;
For electricity and services produced by the public sector, the&#13;
supply constraint is assumed not to be binding. The working of these two&#13;
markets is explained in Figure 3.2. MC is the marginal cost curve; it is not&#13;
the supply curve which is the flat line S at the price p. Thus supply is&#13;
assumed to be perfectly elastic at the administered price p. This assumption&#13;
implies that both electricity and services operate below full capacity. The&#13;
assumption of increasing marginal cost is there to capture the fact that when&#13;
production is expanding, less efficient idle inputs are brought into produc-&#13;
tion.  Assume now the demand curve to be at D2, the firm will supply q2 at the&#13;
price p. The marginal cost will be at M and the profit margin of the firm&#13;
will be squeezed. If, on the contrary tfe demand curve is at D1, the firm&#13;
would be making a pure profit beyond the return to capital measured by its&#13;
marginal productivity. An adjustment in p will affect, in the first round, on&#13;
the one hand the levels of demand and production and on the other hand the&#13;
profitability of the firm. However, the output response is not directly&#13;
related to the price adjustment but indirectly through demand.&#13;
One last market to be considered is that of oil. There both the&#13;
price and the output are exogenously fixed. Figure 3.3 explains the operatidn&#13;
of the oil market. Output is given at q and the price p values output at the&#13;
1/  Note that Table 3.1 consists of two parts:    Table 3.1.A and Table 3.1.B.&#13;
2/ This demand curve is for foreign and regulated demand by the government.&#13;

"well head." After allowing for taxes and subsidies, domestic demand is&#13;
obtained from the intersection of the demand curve D and the supply curve S at&#13;
qd; q - q, is the quantity exported. Thus the oil market has a fixed domestic&#13;
price, a ixed output and perfectly elastic export demand. Exports clear the&#13;
market. An upward adjustment in the price p would tend to contract domestic&#13;
demand and leave a larger exportable surplus.&#13;
In the foregoing we have dealt with the nine first lines of Table&#13;
3.1, corresponding to the nine markets where trade takes place between public&#13;
sector production activities and traders. These markets are characterized by&#13;
fixed prices and are either demand or supply driven. We now turn to the next&#13;
nine lines in Table 3.1, corresponding to the markets where private producers&#13;
sell their outputs. All private producers sell on competitive markets where&#13;
the price clears supply and demand. This is not however completely true for&#13;
private agriculture. Indeed government trading agencies will buy a certain&#13;
amount of production at a regulated price. The level of activity of private&#13;
agriculture will however be determined by the level of non-regulated demand:&#13;
farmers will produce beyond what the government agencies will buy. The&#13;
additional supply will be sold at a price which clears the market. Figure 3.4&#13;
explains the operation of the market of agricultural goods. Government&#13;
agencies will buy qg at the price pg and qm - q    will be sold on the free&#13;
market at the price Pm-&#13;
1.1.2 From Foreign Suppliers to Traders&#13;
According to the exchange rate regime and the regulations which&#13;
govern the transaction, imports can be classified into three categories: (i)&#13;
those financed through the central bank foreign exchange pool, (ii) those&#13;
financed through the commercial banks forei     exchange pool, and (iii) imports&#13;
financed through the parallel market pool. -&#13;
Lines 18 to 26 of Table 3.1 refer to the markets of imports supplied&#13;
through the central bank pool where the exchange rate is fixed. Along with&#13;
the small country assumption the world supply, at the going exchange rate, is&#13;
perfectly elastic. However traders cannot import any desired quantities&#13;
through this pool. Regulated imports are fixed in quantities, corresponding&#13;
to an inelastic demand by the importing agencies. The unregulated imports,&#13;
except for oil, are rationed through a quota-type system. In Figure 3.5,&#13;
panel A, the demand curve for imports is at D, the world supply at Pm and the&#13;
quota at q. There is thus a virtual price at Pv and an implicit rent&#13;
corresponding to the shaded area. Panel B refers to imports of oil which are&#13;
not submitted to a quota. Wherever the demand schedule D intersects the world&#13;
supply curve at pm, the implied imports will be allowed in. A devaluation of&#13;
the exchange rate governing transactions on the central bank pool of foreign&#13;
exchange will in a2yirst round contract oil imports and the implicit rents on&#13;
the other imports.-&#13;
1/ In early 1983 the Central Bank rate was at .7iE per $, the commercial&#13;
banks rate was at .85 BE while the parallel market was close to 1.2bE.&#13;
2/ If the devaluation is too large it could transform the rent into a tax.&#13;

Lines 27 to 35 of Table 3.1 correspond to imports through the&#13;
commercial banks pool where the exchange rate is also fixed. On this pool,&#13;
imports are rationed but through a different mechanism than on the central&#13;
bank pool. HT5e foreign exchange is allocated on different types of imports&#13;
commodities. -L Given the world price and the exchange rate, this allocation&#13;
determines the quantities which can be imported.     In Figure 3.6, q is the&#13;
quantity which can be afforded given the world price and the exchange rate. A&#13;
rent corresponding to p abp is implied. A devaluation of the commercial&#13;
banks exchange rate will contract the rent.&#13;
On the "parallel market" pool (lines 36 to 44 of Table 3.1) the&#13;
allocation of foreign exchange and the determination of the level imports are&#13;
different. The exchange rate is free to adjust to clear the supplies and&#13;
demand for foreign exchange.&#13;
1.2 From Traders to Final Users&#13;
Traders were identified in the foregoing. They trade in domestic&#13;
goods for the domestic market, they export or import. Their activity is&#13;
either regulated or unregulated. Table 3.1 presented in each of its lines a&#13;
market where suppliers and traders are transacting. The columns of Table 3.1&#13;
identify the sources of supplies of traders. The goods they buy need now to&#13;
be channelled to the final users. The latter are identified in columns of&#13;
Table 3.2. They are rural and urban households, the government, investors,&#13;
firms buying intermediates and the rest of the world. Each of these final&#13;
users can obtain goods either from regulated or from unregulated markets.&#13;
Each line of Table 3.2 identifies one market between a trader and final users.&#13;
The distinction between regulated and unrregulated markets is the&#13;
following. On the former prices are fixed and final users are rationed. On&#13;
the latter prices are flexible and clear the markets. On the regulated&#13;
markets both the ration and the price are policy variables. Exports through&#13;
regulated channels of distribution are however not rationed. Indeed oil&#13;
exports are a residual equal to what is left after domestic consumption is&#13;
satisfied. Exports of transportation are in effect the receipts of the Suez&#13;
Canal. They are exogenous in dollars depending on the state of world trade.&#13;
For agricultural exports through regulated channels, the government trading&#13;
agency procures fixed quantities from producers and tries to get the best&#13;
price on the world market. The difference will find its way to the budget.&#13;
2. Factor Markets&#13;
The MISR2 class of models identifies explicitly three categories of&#13;
factors of production: labor, capital and land. The operations of the&#13;
markets of the services of these factors, in the reference model of the class,&#13;
are considered in the following.&#13;
Corresponding to the rural-urban duality of the Egyptian economy,&#13;
labor markets in MISR2 are separated between urban and rural areas. In urban&#13;
areas, within each period, the nominal wage is fixed and supply is assumed&#13;
1/ This is a direct allocation reflecting policy choices.&#13;

perfectly elastic. There is unemployment. In rural areas, labor supply is&#13;
fixed and the wage adjusts to clear the market. However, all production&#13;
sectors, whether in urban or rural areas are not assumed to pay the same&#13;
wage. Public sector firms pay a given wage, considered a policy variable.&#13;
The differentials between public sector wages and the basic rural and urban&#13;
wages adjust. The differentials between the private sector wages and the&#13;
basic wages are assumed fixed.&#13;
The reference model of the MISR2 class captures another feature of&#13;
labor markets in Egypt: public sector activities are expected by the&#13;
government to absorb a certain amount of the increase in the labor force.&#13;
Thus state enterprises have a very limited leeway in their hiring decisions.&#13;
Furthermore they cannot fire labor except under exceptional circumstances.&#13;
For all practical purposes, their wage bill is fixed. This feature of&#13;
employment policies is captured by assuming that labor, in public sector&#13;
activities, is a fixed factor. This implies that a rent accrues to labor, a&#13;
rent which may fall short or exceed the cash the public sector activities pay&#13;
for labor services. The difference between the rent and the cash payments is&#13;
absorbed by the operating surplus of these activities. Practically this&#13;
amounts to a tax imposed on the public sector production activities.&#13;
Capital and land are the two other primary factors used in&#13;
production. Land appears explicitly in agriculture and is assumed fixed&#13;
within a period. It thus earns a rent which is channeled to the owners of the&#13;
land. The treatment of capital is identical. Capital is immobile within a&#13;
period and earns also a rent again distributed across owners.&#13;
3. Foreign Exchange and Trade&#13;
Trade with the rest of the world is an area where governments tend to&#13;
get heavily involved. The MISR2 reference model captures the trade regime in&#13;
Egypt by assuming three balance of payments with three exchange rates.&#13;
The first balance of payments records transactions through the&#13;
central bank pool of foreign exchange. The exchange rate is nominally fixed&#13;
and the market of foreign exchange clears through net transfers to the second&#13;
balance of payments. Thus the first balance of payments works like a&#13;
traditional foreign exchange market with a fixed exchange rate (price) and&#13;
adjustment in net borrowing (quantity adjustment). The only difference is&#13;
that the "net borrowing" 17 not from the rest of the world but from the second&#13;
pool of foreign exchange.-&#13;
This second pool of foreign exchange finances transactions recorded&#13;
in the second balance of payments. Again the nominal exchange rate is fixed,&#13;
and the supply and demand of foreign exchange clears via rationing of&#13;
imports. Once compulsory transfers to abroad are made, there is a certain&#13;
amount of foreign exchange left. This is then allocated, in a policy&#13;
decision, across various commodities. This allocation, jointly with the world&#13;
1/ The net borrowing from abroad through the first balance of payments is&#13;
fixed and considered a policy variable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
prices and the exchange rate, determines the amounts of imports of each&#13;
commodity allowed through this second pool.&#13;
The third balance of payments corresponds to the "parallel" market of&#13;
foreign exchange. There the nominal exchange rate adjusts to equilibrate&#13;
inflows and outflows of foreign exchange.&#13;
An important issue implied by the existence of three balance of&#13;
payments is the allocation of imports between them. The last 18 columns of&#13;
Table 3.1 distinguish between imports through unregulated and regulated&#13;
channels of distribution. The Table 3.1 also shows the sources of these&#13;
imports. Imports traded through regulated channels of distribution come&#13;
entirely through the first balance of payments. Most of imports traded&#13;
through unregulated channels can come through either of the three balance of&#13;
payments. Consider, as an example, imports of "other-industry" goods. The&#13;
goods coming through the three balance of payments are not identical; they are&#13;
similar, substitutable. Depending on relative prices, between the three&#13;
pools, traders will allocate their total demand for industrial goods imports&#13;
by minimizing their costs. They will thus have a demand on each of the&#13;
pools. However on the central and commercial banks pools, traders will be&#13;
rationed. In order to obtain additional imports, they will need to go to the&#13;
"parallel market" pool.   This will drive up the price of foreign exchange on&#13;
that market and push up the cost of imports. Wherever imports are rationed a&#13;
rent larger than the cash payment will appear. The difference (between the&#13;
rent and the cash payment) is an import premium which is channelled back to&#13;
the final users of imports: households, companies.&#13;
4. The Macroeconomic Equilibrium&#13;
In MISR2, two savings pools and three categories of investors are&#13;
identified. The two savings pools capture the public-private sector distinc-&#13;
tion in savings mobilization. The first category of investors correspond to&#13;
production activities in the private sector while the second category corres-&#13;
ponds to those in the public sector. The last category is the government.&#13;
The private savings pool collects the savings of all private agents&#13;
in the economy, namely households and private companies. It also receives&#13;
foreign savings coming through the parallel market of foreign exchange. The&#13;
foreign savings are asumed fixed in dollars reflecting the view that their&#13;
supply is inelastic. This is consistent with the flexibility of the exchange&#13;
rate on the parallel market of foreign exchange. Total resources available to&#13;
the private savings pool are then allocated to the public sector savings pool&#13;
and to private investors. The allocation captures the issuing of bonds by the&#13;
public sector in order to mobilize private resources. This process determines&#13;
the availability of financial resources to private investors, constraining the&#13;
total amount of investment they can undertake. The question of the&#13;
allocation, between the various private sector investors, of the total amount&#13;
of funds available to them, however, remains. It is dealt with along the&#13;
lines proposedin Dervis, de Melo and Robinson (1982). In essence each private&#13;
investor will see his share of funds increase if the rate of return of his&#13;
activity is higher than the average rate of return in the private sector.&#13;
Otherwise the share will decrease. The variation in shares takes place&#13;
between periods; within a period they are kept constant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
The public savings pool receives funds from three sources: (i)&#13;
public sector companies and government; (ii) the private sector, through the&#13;
private sector savings pool and    (iii) the rest of the world.   Funds from the&#13;
rest of the world are foreign savings coming through the central bank and the&#13;
commerical banks foreign exchange pools. In both cases these foreign savings&#13;
are assumed to be limited in amount. In addition to the view that they may&#13;
not be forthcoming, authorities may not want to accelerate the accumulation of&#13;
foreign debt.   The public sector as a whole then f       es a "self-imposed"&#13;
constraint on the availability of foreign savings.-      The limitation in the&#13;
amount of foreign savings, together with doemstic funds, determines the total&#13;
resources available to the public sector savings pool. On the other hand,&#13;
authorities will decide on the total public sector investment budget. That is&#13;
nominal investment will be fixed. The mechanism through which the public&#13;
sector savings gap will be closed is the contraction or expansion of the      2/&#13;
economy. Indeed, the nominal value of the domestically generated savings -&#13;
going to the public sector pool will need to increase in order to validate the&#13;
nominal value of investment. In the process, because of resource constraints,&#13;
including foreign exchange, the real value of nominaliy fixed variables be cut&#13;
and in particular real public investment will adjust.-&#13;
One question remains to be clarified: what sets the general price&#13;
level (GPL)? In practice a GPL is an aggregate price obtained as an index of&#13;
several more specific prices. In the MISR2 reference model, several prices&#13;
are fixed within the period, among them are the prices of public sector&#13;
outputs, the prices of rationed goods, the urban wage, the world prices and&#13;
the central and commercial banks exchange rates. All these prices tie down,&#13;
to a certain extent, the GPL. Other prices in MISR2 adjust to clear&#13;
markets. They ultimately respond to basic constraints in the economy in terms&#13;
of production capacity, rural labor supply, foreign exchange availability.&#13;
The tighter the latter, the larger aggregate demand and the higher the&#13;
flexible prices will go relatively to the fixed ones. As a consequence any&#13;
average price, hence a measure of the GPL, will reflect the way relative price&#13;
changes affects the components of aggregate demand. An aggregate excess&#13;
demand hits basic constraints forcing adjustments in aggregate demands and in&#13;
supplies. What actually happens are shifts in relative prices against the&#13;
commodities with fixed prices and in favor of the commodities which are in&#13;
limited supply.&#13;
1/ This reflects policy makers concern about the accumulation of foreign debt.&#13;
2/ Consider the following relation PI.I = S + eF where PI.I is the fixed&#13;
value of public investment, e the fixed exchange rate, F fixed foreign&#13;
savings and S domestically generated savings going to the public sector.&#13;
If the left-hand side is larger than the right-hand side, S will need to&#13;
increase to validate the equality. With given savings rate (S = cY where&#13;
Y is income) Y will expand. But because of resource constraints relative&#13;
prices will change and affect the various categories of aggregate&#13;
demand. In particular private sector prices and the "parallel" market&#13;
exchange rate will rise relatively to the fixed prices in the economy:&#13;
public sector prices and world prices.&#13;
3/ This is the process of adjustment which seems to best describe&#13;
macroeconomic adjustment in the first part of the eighties.&#13;

CHAPTER 2: The Formulation of the MISR2 Reference Model&#13;
The previous chapter provided a non-technical presentation of the&#13;
economics of the reference MISR2 model. It dealt with the equilibrium&#13;
obtained in each period. This chapter provides a detailed documentation of&#13;
the within-period module of the model. The chapter is organized into three&#13;
parts.  Part A gives a brief review of the transaction values (TV) approach&#13;
which is used to implement the model.   Part B presents the accounting&#13;
framework (SAM) of the MISR2 reference model, while part C presents the TV&#13;
specifications used in MISR2 and the within-period module of the reference&#13;
model as formulated in TV.&#13;
A. The TV Approach&#13;
1. An Overview of TV&#13;
The within-period module is formulated and implemented along the&#13;
Transactions-Values (TV) approach - see Drud, Grais, Pyatt (1983). Because of&#13;
the presumed unfamiliarity of the reader with the approach and because it&#13;
motivates the way the presentation of the module is given, we overview it here&#13;
briefly.&#13;
The formulation of an economywide model requires three sets of&#13;
information: (i) an accounting framework; (ii) a specification of behaviors&#13;
and technologies; and (iii) constraints ensuring the consistency1 of the&#13;
independent decisions of the agents intervening in the economy.-      The TV&#13;
approach organizes these informations in a systematic way using a Social&#13;
Accounting Matrix (SAM). The SAM of the MISR2 is presented in detail in part&#13;
B of this chapter.&#13;
A SAM provides the accounting of an economy in a matrix format where&#13;
each agent has a row and a colum registering his receipts and outlays&#13;
respectively. Thus each cell in a SAM represents a payment from a column to a&#13;
row which is, in all generality the value of a transaction. All entries in a&#13;
SAM can therefore be regarded as representing Transactions Values (TV's). The&#13;
accounting framework of economywide models, specified along the TV approach,&#13;
is provided by a SAM.&#13;
Going beyond the accounting framework the TV's reflect underlying&#13;
agent behaviors and technologies. Consumer expenditures result from utility-&#13;
maximization, factor payments from profit-maximization: all sorts of&#13;
allocation rules may be envisaged. Hence an economywide model involves the&#13;
modeling of the entries of a SAM through explaining the behavior underlying&#13;
the realized TV's. The specification of the behavior associated with each&#13;

parameters and exogenous variables.&#13;

cell of the SAlM will provide an almost complete information on behaviors and&#13;
technologies. -I&#13;
Having told how each agent intervening in the economy takes his&#13;
decisions, one question remains: what ensures the consistency of all&#13;
independent decisions? A consistent equilibrium is achieved for some vector&#13;
of prices, quantities and values which makes all accounts in the SAM&#13;
balance. The balancing of each account will rely either on price, quantity,&#13;
value or on all three types of adjustments. Defining for each account which&#13;
of the price, quantity or value attached to it adjusts will specify how all&#13;
allocation decisions are made consistent and define equilibrium.&#13;
The TV approach has led to the development of a software for&#13;
implementing and solving economy-wide models formulated along the lines&#13;
described above. It requires from the user: (i) a SAM for a base-year; (ii)&#13;
the TV specification of each cell; (iii) 2he system constraints indicating how&#13;
each account balances. This information-I/ is then used to solve for a&#13;
general equilibrium under alternative assumptions on the policy parameteres.&#13;
In the following we first present, in part B, the 3ccounting&#13;
framework (SAM) of the reference model in the MISR2 class      Part C of this&#13;
chapter then gives a documentation of the TV specifications--the behaviors and&#13;
technologies--and of the systems constraints which ensure the consistency of&#13;
the independent decisions of the agents intervening in the economy.&#13;
B. The MISR2 SAM&#13;
1. An Introduction to the SAM Framework&#13;
The accounting and disaggregation of the MISR2 models are captured by&#13;
an underlying Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). The first historic attempt to&#13;
provide national accounting information in a "SAM" was developed for England&#13;
for 1688 by Gregory King (Pyatt and Thorbecke 1976, pp. 22-23). The basic&#13;
idea King developed has been extended in the United Nations System of National&#13;
Accounts (the SNA) (UNSO 1968). However, the SNA emphasizes the structure of&#13;
1/ Each cell specification does not however provide a full account of&#13;
behaviors and technologies. Indeed it will generally include parameters&#13;
which values characterize behaviors and technologies at particular points&#13;
in time and space. Any implementation requires a full information on the&#13;
specifications of each cell and necessitates also numerical values for&#13;
behavioral and technological parameters. An advantage of the TV approach&#13;
is that most of these parameters can be derived from the base year SAM, in&#13;
such a way that the model reproduces the base year data. Other parameters&#13;
must however be obtained from other sources.&#13;
2/ In addition, the values taken by parameters, which cannot be derived fran&#13;
the SAM will also be needed.&#13;
3/ This is the model used to derive the reference path. The SAM is presented&#13;
in considerable detail because understanding of this SAM helps to a great&#13;
extent to understand the model.&#13;

production in an economy, largely disregarding distributional issues. The&#13;
recent development of SAMs by Pyatt and associates (Pyatt and Roe 1977) has&#13;
concentrated on flows of incomes and expenditures between the major institu-&#13;
tional participants in an economy, attempting to capture income distribution.&#13;
In essence, a SAM is a consistent data system that provides&#13;
comprehensive base-year information on such variables as: (i) the structure,&#13;
composition and level of production; (ii) the factoral value added; and (iii)&#13;
the distribution of income among household groups. Typically, a SAM is&#13;
organized around an input-output table, and includes information on&#13;
consumption and production patterns, exports, imports, investment, and&#13;
savings. Depending on the particular issues of interest and the data&#13;
available, a SAM may include more detailed information on income distribution,&#13;
tax structure, and monetary variables. The most important feature of a social&#13;
accounting matrix is that it provides a consistent, convenient approach to&#13;
organizing economic data for a country, and it can provide a basis for the&#13;
formulation of economywide frameworks for policy analysis.&#13;
The conceptual framework of a SAM is explained in Pyatt and Thorbecke&#13;
(1976) and King (1981). Several well documented SAMs have been compiled&#13;
during the last decade and work on SAMs is progressing in many countries. All&#13;
of these SAMs are "accounting" SAMs, since they are focused on the one hand&#13;
mainly on organization, and reconciliation of statistical data, and on the&#13;
other hand on the descriptive analysis of economywide data for a particular&#13;
country.&#13;
Recently a new generation of "modeling" SAMs and the Transaction&#13;
Value (TV) approach have been developed. These SAMs serve as data base,&#13;
accounting base, and algebraic statements of economywide equilibrium models.&#13;
The TV approach is a systematic and flexible way of formulating and&#13;
implementing economywide multisectoral equilibrium models based on a SAM&#13;
(Drud, Grais, and Pyatt 1983). The first attempt at using the TV approach was&#13;
made for the SIAM1 model of Thailand (Drud, Grais, and Vujovic 1982). Most&#13;
recently, the Thailand SAM of the SIAM 2 model (Amranand and Grais, 1983) has&#13;
been contructed as the most disaggregated and ccmprehensive "modeling" SAM&#13;
(Chewakrengkai and Lamsam 1982). Simultaneously with the SIAM 2 model for&#13;
Thailand, the MISR 2 model for Egypt has been developed. Both of these models&#13;
use the TV approach. They are the latest vintage of economywide frameworks&#13;
for policy analysis. The major advantages of the approach used in these&#13;
models is that it allows a large flexibility in the specification of the&#13;
model. Alternative behaviors, policy regimes and institutional arrangements&#13;
can be captured in a fairly simple way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
The SAM underlying the MISR 2 mod ls of Egypt is derived from the&#13;
1979 SAM 2 for Egypt built by the DRTPC. 1&#13;
In the following the configuration of the accounts of the MISR2&#13;
models and their underlying SAM are explained. This part of the chapter is&#13;
organized into three sections. Section one describes an aggregate SAM for&#13;
Egypt. Section two describes an intermediate disaggregation of the accounts&#13;
focusing on the main economic issues the MISR2 models are designed to&#13;
address. These issues are pricing and trade policies. The emphasis of the&#13;
intermediate disaggregation is on the description of distinctions between on&#13;
one hand activities and commodities and on the other hand of the rest of the&#13;
world accounts which are the relevant accounts for the issues considered. The&#13;
third section describes the fully disaggregated SAM on which the MISR2 models&#13;
are based.&#13;
2. The Aggregate SAM for Egypt&#13;
The aggregate SAM for Egypt is presented in Table A.1.a. It consists&#13;
of six basic accounts: (i) factors of production; (ii) currrent accounts of&#13;
institutions; (iii) consolidated capital accounts; (iv) activities; (v)&#13;
commodities; and (vi) the rest of the world. This macroeconomic SAM for Egypt&#13;
for the year 1979 presents the aggregate income and expenditures flows between&#13;
the six categories of accounts.&#13;
The first class of accounts in Table A.l.a, Factors of Production,&#13;
identify the receipts and disbursements of factor incomes within the&#13;
economy. Factor income is derived from employment in government (LE 1242.8&#13;
million), from domestic production activities (intersection of column eight&#13;
with rows 1, 2, and 3), and from abroad. This is shown in first three rows,&#13;
while the allocation of this factor income between domestic institutions, and&#13;
payments abroad of factor income, are shown in first three columns. Three&#13;
factors of production are distinguished in this aggregate SAM for Egypt: (1)&#13;
labor, (2) capital, and (3) land. Row account totals for each factor give&#13;
detailed view of the functional, or factoral, distribution of income by source&#13;
within the economy, while the columns of the factor account indicate who&#13;
receives these factor incomes. Factors of production are further&#13;
disaggregated in the detailed accounts which are presented in the following&#13;
sections.&#13;
The second class of accounts in Table A.1.a, the Current Institutions&#13;
1/ Development Research and Technological Planning Center of Cairo&#13;
University. Concepts underlying SAM 2 are summarized in Pleskovic and&#13;
Crosswell (1981); for a detailed documentation of the SAM 2, see: Working&#13;
Paper No. 7, "SAM 2 and Documentation," DRTPC, Cairo University, 1982.&#13;
This SAM 2 for Egypt is a part of the output of a larger joint project of&#13;
the DRTPC, Cairo University, U.S. Agency for International Development&#13;
(AID) and the World Bank. Several Egyptian agencies and professionals&#13;
participated in compiling the SAM 2 for Egypt, including representatives&#13;
of DRTPC, Ministry of Planning, CAPMAS (Central Agency for Public&#13;
Mobilization and Statistics), and Institute of Planning. The development&#13;
of the MISR 2 model and its SAM would not have been possible without their&#13;
valuable efforts and participation.&#13;

Accounts, divide institutions into five categories: households, private&#13;
companies, public companies, and government. Households and companies are&#13;
domestic institutions receiving factor income. For example, households&#13;
receive LE 5578.4 million from labor, LE 3586.6 million from capital, and LE&#13;
306.5 million from land rent. Domestic institutions also receive transfers&#13;
and spend part of their income as transfer payments. Government income&#13;
collected in row 8 is almost entirely tax and transfer income with the excep-&#13;
tion of imputed rent on government dwellings. On the other hand, this income&#13;
is spent on transfers to households, companies, and the rest of the world, or&#13;
it is spent on commodities as government consumption (i.e., LE 837.0&#13;
million). Companies distribute part of their profits to households in form of&#13;
dividends. The sums of all receipts of factoral income and transfers by&#13;
institutions represent the distribution of income among designated&#13;
institutions.&#13;
The third main account of the aggregate SAM for Egypt is the&#13;
consolidated capital account. Receipts along the row show savings (transfers&#13;
from currrent to capital account) of each domestic institution, together with&#13;
current transfers from abroad. The row sum of this account (LE 4150.0&#13;
million) provides the necessary finance for gross domestic fixed capital&#13;
formation and changes in stocks.&#13;
Next two accounts are for production activities and for commodities&#13;
they produce. The column entries of the production account indicate the costs&#13;
incurred in production, including payments for services of factors of&#13;
production, payments for intermediate inputs (LE 10063.0 million); and&#13;
paymenst of taxes (fees and licences). The sum of this column gives domestic&#13;
production valued at "factory gate" prices. The output of the domestic&#13;
production activity (LE 21080.8 million) appears at the intersection beween&#13;
commodity column and activity account row. A second entry in the commodity&#13;
column is net indirect taxes (LE 411.1 million). This entry represents the&#13;
difference between aggregate domestic production valued at factory-gate prices&#13;
and at market prices. Next two entries of the commodity column represent&#13;
imports at official and own exchange rates, respectively. Together, these&#13;
entries sum to the total commodity supply valued at market prices.&#13;
Commodities are distributed to satisfy domestic final demand,&#13;
intermediate demand for production, and export demand along the row of the&#13;
commodity account. Final demand consists of household consumption LE 8,222.0&#13;
million, public consumption LE 837.0 million, and investment LE 4,150.0&#13;
million; intermediate demand is equal to LE 10,063.0 million; and export&#13;
demand amounts to 3,743.3 million.&#13;
The final account of the aggregate SAM for Egypt, Table A.1.a, is the&#13;
rest of the world account. This account is subdivided into the foreign&#13;
exchange budget and the own exchange account. The former reflects&#13;
transactions that are undertaken at the official exchange rate. The latter&#13;
row and column, on the other hand, account for imports which are financed&#13;
through savings of the Egyptians working abroad and which are bought at the&#13;
"market" exchange or own exchange rate.&#13;
3. An Intermediate Disaggregation of the SAM Accounts&#13;
The SAM in Table A.1.a is the most aggregated version of the data&#13;
base for the MISR2 model. However, the accounts of the SAM underlying the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -&#13;
MISR2 model are disaggregated to a larger extent, providing a final SAM&#13;
composed of 362 x 362 accounts. Because it is impossible to present such a&#13;
complete matrix on one page, two steps are taken to provide the basic&#13;
understanding of the final SAM and interactions between the individual&#13;
accounts. The first step presented below is a description of two intermediate&#13;
SAMs, each focusing on the main economic issues that underlie the accounting&#13;
structure of the model.   One of these intermediate SAMs, Table A.1.b, outlines&#13;
the major groups and features of the production activities and commodities&#13;
accounts. The other, Table A.1.c, describes the interactions of the rest of&#13;
the world accounts with other aggregate accounts.&#13;
All of these accounts are then disaggregated in detail, one by one in&#13;
the second step (Tables A.1.1 to A.1.19). Disaggregated individual accounts&#13;
are presented in the third section of this chapter as independent medium size&#13;
matrices. These are, however, too large to be composed into one final SAM&#13;
matrix. In order to find out how these disaggregated matrices fit into the&#13;
final SAM it is necessary to use the two intermediate SAMs as a reference&#13;
point. These two SAMs therefore show the major interactions between the more&#13;
aggregate accounts, whose internal structure can be found in the tables&#13;
(matrices) presented in the third part of this paper.&#13;
3.1.  An Intermediate Disaggregation of Activities and Commodities&#13;
Table A.1.b presents an intermediate level of disaggregation of the&#13;
commodities and activities accounts of Table A.I.a. A new account for&#13;
composite inputs (intermediates) is also introduced in this table&#13;
(columns/rows 2 to 5), while factors of production and the rest of the world&#13;
account are aggregated each into one row and column. Otherwise Table A.I.b&#13;
keeps the same disaggregation as Table A.l.a.     Its purpose is to present the&#13;
main structure of disaggregated commodities and activities accounts of the SAM&#13;
underlying the MISR2 model.&#13;
One of the major emphasis of the MISR2 model and its SAM is on the&#13;
analysis of pricing policies in the Egyptian economy. The structure of&#13;
pricing policies is captured in the SAM framework through disaggregation of&#13;
activities into public and private activities; and through disaggregation of&#13;
commodities into government trade and non-government trade commodities both&#13;
subdivided into domestic, imported, and exported commodities.&#13;
In Table A.1.b activities are disaggregated into public and private&#13;
activities accounts. Each of these consist of nine sectors described in&#13;
detail in the main paper. One of the key features of the production account&#13;
for Egypt is the distinction between public and private activities. This&#13;
division has been made to reflect the major presence of the public sector in&#13;
production, accounting for over fifty percent of the gross output. The&#13;
rationale for the distinction between public and private activities is that&#13;
producers may behave differently in response to different incentives present&#13;
in each of the two sectors. For instance, public production in Egypt is&#13;
regulated to a great extent in terms of the quantity to be produced; the price&#13;
received for the output; the level of employment and wages; and taxation or&#13;
transfers of operating surplus to the government. On the other hand, private&#13;
sector production corresponds more closely to traditional profit-maximizing&#13;
behavior, although prices and quantities are regulated in some cases (e.g.,&#13;
cotton). A second rationale is to be able to examine differences between the&#13;
structure of production and value added in the public and private sectors.&#13;

For example, value added generated in private activities exceeds the value&#13;
added by public activities; public sector production is concentrated in&#13;
specific economic sectors and reveals distinct patterns of exports, imports,&#13;
and intermediate consumption.&#13;
Public and private activities appear in columns/rows 12 and 13 in&#13;
Table A.1.b. In this SAM columns 12 and 13 show the cost payments of&#13;
activities to primary factors (labor, capital, and land), to composite inputs&#13;
(domestic and imported intermediate inputs), and to the government (fees and&#13;
licences). The sums of these two columns represent the aggregate production&#13;
of public and private activities (at producers cost). These productions are&#13;
supplied to the commodity accounts for domestic use and exports in rows 12 and&#13;
13.&#13;
The commodity accounts, presented in columns/rows 14 to 26, are&#13;
subdivided into several subaccounts, because in the Egypt economy some&#13;
activities are assumed to produce several commodities and some commodities are&#13;
produced by different activities. The intersection of rows 12 and 13 with&#13;
columns 14 to 26 represents the mapping between activities and commodities.&#13;
Commodity accounts buy the outputs of public and private activities and pay&#13;
the commodity taxes to the government in row 9. The sums of commodity columns&#13;
represent the supplies of domestic goods and services at market prices.&#13;
Table A.l.b distinguishes two major groups of commodities: (1)&#13;
government trade lcmmodities, and (2) non-government trade commodities.&#13;
Government trade -.is a special institution created by the Egyptian&#13;
government. The major role of this institution is to buy domestic or imported&#13;
goods and to deliver them to the distribution companies (wholesale trade),&#13;
directly to consumers and producers or the the rest of the world (exports).&#13;
The government trade also finances the difference between purchasing prices&#13;
and selling prices at which the goods are delivered to consumers. The&#13;
difference represents either subsidies to consumers or producers who buy&#13;
government traded goods; or export taxes in case of government trade exports,&#13;
since these are bought at a lower price on the domestic market and sold at&#13;
world prices to the rest of the world. Thus, the distribution of commodities&#13;
through government trade channels is the main vehicle for implementing&#13;
subsidies or indirect taxes in Egypt.&#13;
As indicated in Table A.1.b, in principle each of the goods and&#13;
services can be distributed through government trade channels, through non-&#13;
government trade channels, or through both. Within each distribution channel&#13;
there are distinctions among imports, exports, and domestically produced goods&#13;
and services (both public and private) destined for the domestic market or for&#13;
exports. As goods and services flow from production activities into these&#13;
various commodity accounts, their value (price) is altered to reflect&#13;
distribution margins, indirect taxes, subsidies, import tariffs, or export&#13;
taxes.&#13;
For instance, in column 14, domestic government trade commodities are&#13;
bought from public and private activities from rows 12 and 13, while indirect&#13;
taxes on these goods and services appear at the intersection of the government&#13;
1/ For a detailed description of government trade, see Working Paper No. 7,&#13;
"Sam 2 and Documentation, Government Trade Sector," DRTPC, Cairo&#13;
University, 1982.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -&#13;
account (row 9) and column 14. The sum of column 14 thus measures supply of&#13;
domestic government commodities at market (or user's) prices. Similarly,&#13;
government trade imports appear at the intersection of column 15 with row 10&#13;
(rest of the world), while import tariffs appear in row 9. Government trade&#13;
exports are measured in the same way. They are bought from the activity&#13;
account in column 16, where export taxes appear in the government account in&#13;
row 9.&#13;
Table A.1.b also introduces composite accounts for non-government&#13;
commodities and intermediate inputs. Composite account is a convenient&#13;
account introduced for goods that are more or less perfectly substitutable.&#13;
Three composite accounts are distinguished in Table A.1.b. First of these is&#13;
presented in columns 2 to 5 (composite inputs), where commodities are a&#13;
composition of government trade and non-government trade domestic and imported&#13;
commodities. The second composite account is indicated in columns 21 and 22,&#13;
where commodities are a combination of public and private commodities. The&#13;
third composite account is for imports. Composite imports are indicated in&#13;
column 26. These are a combination of the Central Bank, commercial banks, and&#13;
own exchange imports. All of the composite accounts are explained in more&#13;
detail below as a part of the structure of other SAM accounts.&#13;
Non-government trade commodities consist of domestic, exported, and&#13;
imported commodities in the same way as government trade commodities. The&#13;
only difference between the two accounts is that non-government trade&#13;
commodities are traded through the composite accounts. That means, for&#13;
example, that non-government trade domestic commodities are at first bought in&#13;
columns 17 and 18 from public and private activities (rows 12 and 13). These&#13;
commodities are then sold from rows 17 and 18 to the composite account at the&#13;
intersection with column 21, where indirect taxes appear in the government&#13;
account in row 9. The sum of the three entries in column 21 gives the supply&#13;
of non-government domestic composite commodities at market prices. Non-&#13;
government trade exports are treated in the same way, except that export taxes&#13;
appear in row 8, public companies (EGPC), instead of in row 9.&#13;
Non-government trade imports are treated in a similar way, except&#13;
that these imports are traded through three different channels. These three&#13;
channels are (1) central bank pool, (-2) commercial banks pool, and (3) own&#13;
exchange pool. The central bank and commercial banks pools represent imports&#13;
bought at two different official foreign exchange rates, while own exchange&#13;
pool represents a parallel market. These three types of imports appear in the&#13;
SAM at the intersection of row 10 with columns 23, 24, and 25. These imports&#13;
are then in turn bought by the composite imports account (column 26) from rows&#13;
23, 24, and 25. Import tariffs appear at the intersection of row 9 with&#13;
column 26, where the sum of column 26 represents the supply of non-government&#13;
imports at market prices. The entry in the cell 24/24 indicates import premia&#13;
which is due to rationing. Non-government imports are explained in more&#13;
detail in the next sections (Table A.1.c and Table A.1.18).&#13;
The columns of the government trade commodity accounts and non-&#13;
government trade composite accounts give the price structure and (implicitly)&#13;
the rate of indirect taxes and subsidies. Rows of these commodity accounts,&#13;
on the other hand, represent the supply of commodities to meet demand, i.e.,&#13;
consumption of commodities at market prices by households, government, capital&#13;
account, rest of the world, and composite inputs account (intermediate&#13;
demand). Goods and services are distributed directly from the two&#13;
distribution channels to final users. In other words, domestic and foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
demand by private consumers, investors, the government, production activities,&#13;
and the rest of the world is disaggregated according to the distribution&#13;
channel (govermnent and non-government trade) and origin (domestically&#13;
produced or imported) for each of the 9 goods and services. This type of&#13;
disaggregation of the final and intermediate demand allows for distinction&#13;
between consumption of government and non-government traded domestic, imported&#13;
and exported commodities. Since each of these commodities is taxed or&#13;
subsidized at different rates, commodity accounts represent different pricing&#13;
policies (commodity markets) in Egypt. In this sense, commodity accounts&#13;
serve as an accounting basis for economic modeling with respect to pricing and&#13;
income distribution issues.&#13;
As noted above, Table A.1.b introduces the composite inputs&#13;
account. The purpose of this account is to capture the accounting structure&#13;
and the composition of intermediate inputs bought by activities. For example,&#13;
intermediate inputs used by public activities are bought in column 2 in Table&#13;
A.1.b from row 14 and row 21. These two entries indicate goverrment trade&#13;
domestic and non-government trade composite domestic commodities. There is an&#13;
additional entry at the intersection of column 2 with primary factors account&#13;
in row 1. This entry indicates a rent which occurs to capital because&#13;
government trade commodities are rationed and subsidized. Other three columns&#13;
(3 to 5) are treated in the same way as column 2. The sums of columns 2 to 5&#13;
represent total domestic and imported intermediate inputs. These are sold to&#13;
public and private activities from rows 2 to 5 at the intersection with&#13;
columns 12 and 13.&#13;
This description of the commodity accounts in Table A.1.b exhausts&#13;
the explanation of interactions between commodity and activity accounts. As&#13;
indicated above, with the exception of the composite inputs account and&#13;
disaggregated activity/commodity accounts, all other interactions in Table&#13;
A.1.b follow the same accounting structure as presented in Table A.1.a.&#13;
3.2. An Intermediate Disaggregation of the Rest of the World Accounts&#13;
Table A.1.c represents an intermediate disaggregation of the rest of&#13;
the world accounts and their interactions with other aggregate accounts. The&#13;
major feature of the disaggregated rest of the world accounts is that they&#13;
attempt to capture foreign trade regime in Egypt. There are currently three&#13;
different exchange rates operating in Egypt: (1) the official (Central Bank)&#13;
rate, (2) the commercial banks rate, and (3) the own exchange rate. The&#13;
official rate applies to the Central Bank pool which is supplied by receipts&#13;
from Suez Canal dues, petroleum and some agricultural exports. Central Bank&#13;
funds are used primarily to service external government debt and to finance&#13;
imports of basic supply commodities.&#13;
The commercial banks pool is supplied mainly by cash remittances from&#13;
Egyptians working abroad, tourism receipts and non-oil and cotton export&#13;
receipts. Commercial banks funds are used to finance the foreign trade of&#13;
public sector companies that are included in the foreign exchange budget but&#13;
not financed by the Central Bank pool. The commercial banks exchange rate is&#13;
different from the official (Central Bank) rate, being in between the official&#13;
rate and the own exchange market.&#13;
The "free" or own exchange market is supplied by remittances from&#13;
Egyptians working abroad and some tourism receipts. Private individuals and&#13;
companies can buy foreign exchange at a freely floating rate in order to&#13;
finance imports or to invest in dollar-denominated assets.&#13;

Therefore, there are three major channels through which exchange with&#13;
the rest of the world takes place in Egypt: (1) Central Bank pool, (2)&#13;
commercial banks pool, and (3) own exchange pool. These three channels and&#13;
transfers between them are captured in columns/rows 7 to 12 in Table A.l.c.&#13;
The rest of the world thus consists of six accounts: (i) Central Bank, (ii)&#13;
transfer account, (iii) commercial banks, (iv) own exchange, (v) pool import&#13;
premia, and (vi) discretionary foreign exchange budget. The intermediate SAM&#13;
in Table A.1.c is similar to the SAM presented in Table A.1.b with two&#13;
exceptions. One exception is that current institutions accounts: households,&#13;
private companies, public companies, and government are aggregated into one&#13;
row and one column to keep the SAM smaller. The other exception is that the&#13;
rest of the world account comprises of six accounts instead of one as in Table&#13;
A.1.b. Activities and commodities accounts are kept disaggregated in Table&#13;
A.l.c because the rest of the world accounts interact to a large extent with&#13;
these accounts, especially with imported commodities. The rest of the&#13;
accounts in Table A.1.c are the same as in the intermediate SAM in Table&#13;
A.1.b.&#13;
In the following each column and row of the rest of the world account&#13;
is explained in terms of expenditures and receipts of these accounts. For&#13;
example, column 7 of the intermediate SAM indicates foreign exchange outflows&#13;
of the Central Bank pool, while row 7 represents foreign exchange receipts of&#13;
the Central Bank pool. Specifically, the intersection of row 1 with column 7&#13;
represents capital earnings (interest) received by factors from abroad; row 6&#13;
shows a value of transfers to current institutions from the rest of the world;&#13;
row 13 shows foreign savings plus changes in reserves (or foreign account&#13;
deficit); row 18 indicates that all government trade exports are traded&#13;
through the Central Bank pool; and row 24 shows that a portion of non-&#13;
government exports is traded through the Central Bank (T24 7) and the&#13;
remaining part through the commercial banks pool (T24.9).&#13;
Foreign exchange receipts of the Central Bank pool can be read along&#13;
row 7 of the SAM. The intersection of this row with column 6 represents a&#13;
portion of current institutions transfers abroad that are channeled through&#13;
the Central Bank. The entry in row 7 and column 8 indicates excess of foreign&#13;
exchange on the Central Bank pool being transferred to the commercial banks.&#13;
And the entry in row 7, column 17 indicates payments for government trade&#13;
imports to the Central Bank pool.&#13;
The next account (column 8) represents transfers between the Central&#13;
Bank pool and the commercial banks pool, where T7 8 has been defined above,&#13;
while Tl 8 represents a difference between the Central Bank exchange rate and&#13;
the commercial banks exchange rate (pool import premia). The sum of column 8&#13;
is transfered from row 8 to the commercial banks pool at the commercial banks&#13;
exchange rate.&#13;
Outflows of the commercial banks pool are indicated in column 9 and&#13;
consist of factors and transfer income (rows 1 and 6), transfer income from&#13;
the Central Bank (row 8), foreign account deficit of the commercial banks pool&#13;
(row 13), and expenditures on non-government trade exports (row 24). On the&#13;
other hand, receipts of the commercial banks pool (row 9) consist of factor&#13;
and transfer incomes sent abroad (columns 1 and 6), and total foreign exchange&#13;
availability for discretionary foreign exchange budget received from column&#13;
12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
Outflows from the own exchange budget are indicated in column 10.&#13;
They consist of factor income (row 1), and foreign savings plus changes in&#13;
reserves (row 13). Receipts of the own exchange budget are from own exchange&#13;
imports which appear at the intersection of row 10 with column 28.&#13;
Expenditures of the next account, pool import premia (column 11),&#13;
consist of premia paid to households and companies. This premia occurs to&#13;
current institutions due to differences between the Central Bank and&#13;
commercial banks exchange rates. Receipts of this account appear in row 11&#13;
and are derived from the transfer account (column 8) and non-government&#13;
imports which appear in columns 25 and 27 in Table A.l.c.&#13;
The last account of the rest of the world is discretionary foreign&#13;
exchange budget. Expenditures of this account are allocated to the commercial&#13;
banks pool in row 9, while receipts of this account are derived from non-&#13;
government imports which appear in column 26.&#13;
This description of the disaggregated Rest of the World account&#13;
presents sources and uses of incomes of this account, as well as its major&#13;
interactions with other SAM accounts.&#13;
4. Disaggregated Individual Accounts of the MISR2 Model and its SAM&#13;
The previous two sections described the aggregate SAM for Egypt and&#13;
two intermediate SAMs with an attempt to highlight the major economic issues&#13;
addressed by the MISR2 model and its accounting structure. The third section&#13;
gives an additional presentation of the SAM accounts. The primary purpose of&#13;
this presentation is to describe the accounting structure of the model in more&#13;
detail, to present its data base, and the main interrelationships between the&#13;
disaggregated accounts. The SAM tables presented in this section are&#13;
described each separately following the major blocks of the aggregate SAM and&#13;
two intermediate SAMs. In order to derive a complete picture of the&#13;
disaggregated SAM, it is necessary to trace these tables back to the&#13;
intermediate SAMs presented in Tables A.1.b and A.l.c.&#13;
4.1. Factors of Production&#13;
4.1.1 - Labor&#13;
Factors of production are aggregated into one row and one column in&#13;
Table A.1.b. In the tables presented in this section, primary factors:&#13;
labor, capital, and land are all further disaggregated. The primary purpose&#13;
for a more detailed disaggregation of factors of production is a concern to&#13;
monitor employment and income distribution implications of the policy&#13;
instruments captured by the model.&#13;
Tables A.1.1 and A.1.2 represent disaggregation of urban and rural&#13;
labor, respectively. Urban labor is employed in the public and private&#13;
sectors and the government. For example, wages paid to urban labor by the&#13;
government, state enterprises (public activities), and private enterprises&#13;
(private activities) appear at the intersection of rows 2 and 3 with columns 5&#13;
to 21 in Table A.1.1. Sectoral wage differentials for a particular activity&#13;
appear in row 4, i.e., revenue account of urban households. The sums of&#13;
columns 5 to 21 thus give average urban wages for specific public and private&#13;
sectors.&#13;

The sums of rows 2 and 3 represent consolidated urban wages for&#13;
aggregate public and private sector. Consolidated wages are treated in the&#13;
column accounts in the same way as disaggregated activity wages. For example,&#13;
the entry in cell 1.3 indicates total urban domestic wages paid by the public&#13;
sector, the entry in cell 4.3 represents wage differential between public and&#13;
private urban sectors, while the total of column 3 indicates the average wage&#13;
in public sector.&#13;
Remittances received by urban labor are paid from the labor abroad&#13;
(column 1) to urban household revenue account in row 4. Total urban labor is&#13;
derived by summing up entries in row 4, and urban labor income transfered&#13;
abroad is indicated at the intersection of row 5 with column 2. Table A.1.2&#13;
is the same as Table A.1.1, except that it represents disaggregation of rural&#13;
labor.&#13;
Table A.1.3 represents a "make up" matrix for total urban and rural&#13;
labor employed by public and private enterprises. For example, the sum of&#13;
column 2 gives total labor employed by public agriculture, where entry in row&#13;
2 indicates urban agricultural labor and entry in row 19 rural agricultural&#13;
labor. There is an additional entry at the intersection of column 2 with row&#13;
35. This entry represents a rent that occurs to capital because of controlled&#13;
wages in public activities. Total labor employed by private enterprises is&#13;
indicated in columns 11 to 17. The accounting structure of those columns is&#13;
the same as for public enterprises, except that there is no entry for a&#13;
capital rent because wages in the private sector are not controlled.&#13;
4.1.2 Capital and Land&#13;
Table A.1.4 describes a treatment of disaggregated capital and land&#13;
accounts. As indicated in this table, the operating surplus of public and&#13;
private activities is paid from columns 2 to 17 to urban and rural households&#13;
in rows 3 and 4. This matrix reflects pattern of ownership of public and&#13;
private sector companies. The capital incomes generated by various activities&#13;
are on the whole distributed on the one hand to urban and rural households and&#13;
on the other hand to companies. This is shown in columns 2 to 17 in Table&#13;
A.1.4. The capital incomes accruing to households from public and private&#13;
companies represent profit sharing and dividends. The capital incomes are&#13;
treated in the same way for all activities with the exception of agriculture,&#13;
electricity and oil. Because of relatively small size of the sectors, in&#13;
agriculture and electricity (columns 2 and 7) all of the operating surpluses&#13;
are allocated to public companies (row 7). In the case of oil, the EGPC has&#13;
been separated from other public companies in order to differentiate between&#13;
the role of the two accounts. Column 1 of Table A.1.4 represents national&#13;
capital account. This account collects in its row net capital income from&#13;
abroad (Table A.1.12) and rents which are due to rationing of domestic markets&#13;
(fixed prices in some public companies, e.g., Table A.1.17). The total&#13;
receipts of the national capital account are reallocated to households,&#13;
companies and the government at the intersection of column 1 with rows 3 to 8.&#13;
Land incomes are captured in row 2 and columns 18 to 20.&#13;
Consolidated rent is indicated in row 2 and is derived from public and private&#13;
land in columns 19 and 20. The sum of row 2 is then allocated in column 18 to&#13;
urban and rural households and other public companies at the intersection of&#13;
rows 3, 4 and 7, respectively.&#13;

4.2  Composite Inputs&#13;
Table A.1.5 represents the structure of composite domestic&#13;
intermediate inputs used by public activities. This table is in essence&#13;
disaggregated column 2 of the intermediate SAM presented in Table A.I.b As it&#13;
is clear from Table A.1.5, public activities buy domestic intermediate inputs&#13;
from government trade channel and non-government trade channel. The&#13;
accounting structure of this matrix is straightforward when intermediate&#13;
inputs are bought from the private channel (non-government commodities) only.&#13;
For example, public activity agriculture buys composite non-government commo-&#13;
dities directly from nine sectors (intersection of column 1 with rows 2 to&#13;
10). This is the same for other activities which appear in columns 5 to 11.&#13;
However, a different accounting procedure is used for intermediates&#13;
that are bought from both government trade and non-government trade&#13;
channels. Because government trade commodities are both, rationed and&#13;
subsidized, additional subaccounts are introduced to capture the difference in&#13;
pricing between government traded and private commodities. For example, food&#13;
processing activity is disaggregated into 3 subaccounts. In column 2 the food&#13;
processing activity buys non-government intermediate commodities from rows 3&#13;
to 10, and a composite domestic commodity agriculture from row 12. Composite&#13;
agriculture consists of both government trade and non-government trade&#13;
agriculture as indicated in column 3 in cells 2.3 and 11.3. The entry in cell&#13;
11.3 is a rent on the rationed input delivered by the government. This rent&#13;
is divided into two elements presented in column 4 in Table A.1.5. Cell 1.4&#13;
represents the cash paid to buy the agricultural commodity, and cell 13.4&#13;
indicates the difference between the actual cash paid and the total rent of&#13;
the fixed factor. The latter appears in row 13 which is capital income of the&#13;
food processing activity because it changes the capital income earned by this&#13;
sector.&#13;
Table A.1.6 represents a disaggregation of the column 3 of the&#13;
intermediate SAM presented in Table A.1.b. The accounting structure of this&#13;
table is exactly the same as in Table A.1.5, except that intermediate inputs&#13;
are bought by private activities instead of public activities.&#13;
Table A.1.7 represents a disaggregation of the column 4 of Table&#13;
A.1.b. The accounting structure of this table is similar to the former two&#13;
tables. This matrix represents the composition of imported intermediate&#13;
inputs used by public activities. Intermediate imported inputs bought by&#13;
public agriculture (columns 1 to 3) are treated in Table A.1.7 in the same way&#13;
as the food processing activity in the previous two tables. The only&#13;
difference between Table A.1.7 and the former two tables is that food&#13;
processing activity buys composite imported inputs from both agriculture and&#13;
food processing, government trade and non-government trade commodity&#13;
accounts. For this reason, there are two rent accounts in columns 4 to 8, one&#13;
for food processing and another for agriculture. In all other respects this&#13;
table confirms exactly to the concept used in the previous two tables.&#13;
Table A.1.8 is a disaggregated column 5 of the intermediate SAM in&#13;
Table A.1.b, representing composite imported intermediate inputs used by&#13;
private activities. This table is in principle the same as the previous three&#13;
tables of composite inputs.&#13;

4.3. Current Institutions Accounts&#13;
4.3.1 Household Accounts&#13;
Table A.1.9 represents uses of urban and rural household incomes.&#13;
This table is a disaggregation of column 6 of the intermediate SAM presented&#13;
in Table A.1.b. Column 1, a revenue account, presents urban household&#13;
outlays: (i) transfers to rural households; (ii) interest payments on credit&#13;
to private and public companies; (iii) payments to the social security&#13;
account; (iv) payments to the government, direct taxes, and (v) transfers to&#13;
abroad. The remaining entry in the cell 9.1 indicates disposable income of&#13;
urban households. This disposable income is allocated to the committed&#13;
expenditure account of urban households at the intersection of column 2 with&#13;
row 11, and to the private savings pool in row 15. The expenditures of urban&#13;
households appear in column 3. These are disaggregated into a consumption of&#13;
government trade subsidized commodities (constrained demand) indicated in&#13;
entries T16.3 to T19.3, and a consumption of domestic and imported non-&#13;
government commodities indicated in T28.3 to T42.3. Total discretionary&#13;
expenditure appears in row 13. Discretionary expenditures are disaggregated&#13;
in column 4, where they are spent in a similar way as committed expenditures:&#13;
on government trade and non-government trade commodities (row 16 to 19, and 28&#13;
to 42).&#13;
Accounts in columns 5 to 8 represent disaggregation of the&#13;
constrained urban household demand. The diagonal entries in these columns&#13;
represent the values that households are willing to pay for government trade&#13;
commodities. The entries in row 9, on .the other hand, represent income&#13;
transfer occuring to urban households due to rationing and subsidization of.&#13;
government trade commodities.&#13;
The other half of Table A.1.9 describes expenditures of rural&#13;
households income. Conceptually, it is identical to the left part of the&#13;
table. The only difference is in the magnitude of actual numbers which&#13;
reflect the differences in expenditures patterns between urban and rural&#13;
households.&#13;
4.3.2 Companies Accounts&#13;
Table A.1.10 describes expenditures accounts of private and public&#13;
companies. The first entry in column 1 represents dividends paid by private&#13;
companies to urban households. The second entry indicates transfers from&#13;
private companies to other public companies. The entry in row six represents&#13;
savings of private companies, while direct taxes are paid in row 12. These&#13;
entries are the same as the ones that appear in column 7 of the intermediate&#13;
SAM in Table A.I.b.&#13;
The second column of Table A.1.10 describes expenditues of EGPC on:&#13;
dividends paid to urban households, transfers to other public companies,&#13;
savings, interest payments to abroad, transfered profits to the government,&#13;
and payments of taxes.&#13;
The third column in this table describes expenditures of other public&#13;
companies. In principle, all of the entries in this column are the same as in&#13;
the first two columns, except that interest payments to abroad are channeled&#13;
&#13;

and that the entry in row 11 indicates payments to the social security&#13;
account.&#13;
4.3.3 Government, Social Security and the Tax Accounts&#13;
Table A.1.11 describes the government accounts. Government income is&#13;
derived from row 1, i.e. the tax accounts and government trade. It should be&#13;
noted that entries for subsidies (column 11) and government trade (column 8)&#13;
are negative, since both of these accounts are financed by the government.&#13;
This means that the sum of the row 1 gives the net revenue of the government.&#13;
Government expenditures appear in columns 1 to 7 in Table A.1.11.&#13;
Government incomes are at first allocated to the government committed&#13;
expenditures accounts for education, health, and other government at the&#13;
intersection of rows 2 to 4 with column 1. Government transfers to urban and&#13;
rural households and companies are indicated in rows 5 to 8. Social security&#13;
contributions and savings appear in rows 9 and 10 and interest payments,&#13;
including transfers abroad in row 35.&#13;
Committed and discretionary expenditures of the three government&#13;
sectors: education, health, and others are indicated in columns 2 to 7 in&#13;
Table A.1.11. Government expenditure on labor is indicated in row 11, while&#13;
government consumption of domestic and imported government trade (subsidized)&#13;
commodities appears in rows 12 to 15. Discretionary expenditures appear on&#13;
diagonal entries in rows 16 to 18. These are then disaggregated as government&#13;
consumption of domestic and imported non-government composite commodities in&#13;
columns 5 to 7 and rows 19 to 34.&#13;
Social security revenues appear in row 9 and expenditures in column&#13;
9. Expenditures consist of social security payments to urban and rural&#13;
households, payments to other companies, surplus of the social security&#13;
account (TIO.9), and social security payments to the government labor (row&#13;
11).&#13;
4.3.4 The Rest of the World Accounts&#13;
Table A.1.12 describes the accounting structure of the rest of the&#13;
world account. As indicated in section 3.2 above, there are three different&#13;
foreign exchange rates currently operating in Egypt. The detailed accounting&#13;
relationships between these three foreign exchange pools, the transfer&#13;
account, and the rest of the SAM accounts are presented in columns 1 to 4 in&#13;
Table A.1.12.&#13;
Column 1 of the rest of the world account represents outflows of&#13;
foreign exchange from the Central Bank pool. The sum of this column is&#13;
measured at the Central Bank foreign exchange rate. Individual entries in&#13;
column 1, from top to the bottom, are indicated at the intersections with non&#13;
empty row cells. The first entry in row 2 indicates receipts by primary&#13;
factors, i.e., earnings of the national capital or interest payments of the&#13;
rest of the world to Egypt. Transfers from abroad to the government are&#13;
indicated in row 6. Net public sector borrowing from abroad (at the Central&#13;
Bank exchange rate) appears in row 7. Entries in rows 9 and 10 indicate&#13;
payment of the rest of the world for government and non-government trade&#13;

exports of agricultural goods, and the remaining two cells in column 1&#13;
represent payments of the rest of the world for non-government exports of oil&#13;
and Suez Canal services.&#13;
The second column is a transfer account between the Central Bank pool&#13;
and the commercial banks pool. The intersection of row 18 with column 2&#13;
indicates transfers of foreign exchange from the Central Bank pool to the&#13;
commercial banks pool at the Central Bank exchange rate. Because the sum of&#13;
this column is valued at the commercial banks rate, the next entry in row 19&#13;
and column 2 represents the difference of valuation of the foreign exchange.&#13;
The third column represents the outflows of foreign exchange from the&#13;
commercial banks pool. The sum of this column is valued at the commercial&#13;
banks foreign exchange rate. First five entries in the column indicate&#13;
remittances, capital earnings, and transfers from abroad to urban and rural&#13;
households and other public companies. Next entry in cell 7.3 indicates net&#13;
public sector borrowing from abroad at the commercial banks exchange rate.&#13;
Entries in rows 11 to 17 represent payments of the commercial banks pool for&#13;
non-government exports, and T20.3 indicates payments of the commercial banks&#13;
pool (in Egyptian pounds) for foreign exchange received from the Central Bank&#13;
pool through the transfer account in row 20.&#13;
Column four indicates outflows of foreigh exchange from the own&#13;
exchange budget. The sum of this column is measured at the own exchange&#13;
rate. The first entry in column four indicates remittances and the second&#13;
entry represents net private sector borrowing from abroad valued at the own&#13;
exchange rate.&#13;
4.4. Capital Accounts&#13;
Table A.1.13 describes expenditures on the Capital Accounts. Column&#13;
1 of this table indicates allocation of private savings to the public savings&#13;
pool and private investment account (rows 1 and 2). Column 2 shows private&#13;
sector investment by sector of destination. Column 3 shows sources of&#13;
investment for the government and state enterprises. The government&#13;
investment income received in row 3 from the public savings pool is spent in&#13;
column 4, where entries in rows 23 to 40 represent fixed capital formation and&#13;
change in stocks by the government. Column 5 represents investment by sector&#13;
of destination by public enterprises.&#13;
Bublic and private activities investment is captured in columns 6 to&#13;
21. Because of a lack of data, public and private investments are aggregated&#13;
into two accounts through the capital goods account in rows 21 and 22.&#13;
Columns 22 and 23 of the capital goods account then show aggregate private and&#13;
public activities investment by destination.&#13;
4.5 Activities&#13;
4.5.1 Public Activities&#13;
Table A.1.14 describes expenditures (cost structure) by public&#13;
activities. In this table, each activity column is measured at three&#13;
different prices: factor cost, producers cost, and users cost. For example,&#13;
in column 1 public agriculture pays for services of primary factors of&#13;

production in rows 1 to 3 (land, capital and labor) and buys domestic and&#13;
imported intermediate inputs from row accounts 4 and 5. The total of this&#13;
column represents factor cost of public agriculture. In column 2 public&#13;
agriculture buys primary factors (including intermediate inputs) from row 6&#13;
and pays taxes (fees and licences) to the tax account in row 56. The sum of&#13;
this column indicates producers cost of public agriculture. The total of&#13;
column 3 (users cost) is in this case equal to column 2, because there is no&#13;
difference between producers cost and users cost for agriculture.&#13;
The accounting structure of other public activities in Table A.1.14&#13;
is the same as for agriculture with exception that there is a difference&#13;
between producers and users prices. This difference is due to fixed prices&#13;
determined by the government for public production. Fixed-prices are&#13;
reflected in Table A.1.14, for example, for food processing activity at the&#13;
intersection of column 6 with row 8, where T8.6 indicates a negative rent&#13;
which occurs because of fixed prices. All other public activities are treated&#13;
in the same way as food processing activity with the exception of oil (column&#13;
19 and 20), where the producers cost is equal to the users cost.&#13;
4.5.2. Private Activities&#13;
Table A.1.15 describes the-cost structure of private activities.&#13;
This table is conceptually the same as Table A.1.14. However, because prices&#13;
for private activities are not controlled by the government, there is no&#13;
difference between the producers cost and the users cost of private&#13;
activities. For example, private agriculture pays for services of primary&#13;
factors of production and for intermediate inputs in column 1, thus giving&#13;
factor cost of production. In column two private activity buys primary inputs&#13;
from row 6 and pays taxes in row 37. This column determines producers cost of&#13;
production. All other private activities are treated in the same way.&#13;
4.6 Commodities&#13;
4.6.1. Government Trade Commodities&#13;
Table A.1.16 describes government trade commodities. For example,&#13;
columns 1 to 4 represent a demand for subsidized government trade domestic and&#13;
imported commodities for agriculture, food processing, other industries, and&#13;
services. These commodities are sold in Table A.1.9 (presented above) from&#13;
diagonal entries in rows 24 to 27 to urban and rural household (constrained&#13;
demand) account. In essence, columns 1 to 4 in Table A.1.16 give the&#13;
composition between domestics and imports of the government trade commodities&#13;
consumed by households.&#13;
The second set of accounts in Table A.1.16, columns 5 to 11, shows&#13;
the composition of domestic government trade commodities. For example,&#13;
government trade agriculture account (column 5) buys agricultural commodities&#13;
from private activities in row 9. Because agricultural commodity is bought by&#13;
the government trade at fixed prices, there is an additional entry at the&#13;
intersection of column 5 with row 24. This entry represents a negative rent&#13;
which accrues to the capital employed in private agriculture. The sum of&#13;
column 5 is sold to the column 6 from row 12 where trade margins (services)&#13;
are entered at the intersection of column of 6 with row 11. Column 6 thus&#13;
represents the cost of private agricultural commodity to the government.&#13;

The subsidized value of this commodity then appears in column 7. The amount&#13;
of subsidy is indicated at the intersection of row 16 with column 7 as a&#13;
negativeentry received by the government trade account. Columns 8 to 10 are&#13;
treated in a similar way with an exception that private food processing&#13;
commodities are not traded at fixed prices. Column 11, government trade&#13;
services has only one positive entry which indicates surplus of government&#13;
trade on this account.&#13;
Government trade imports, columns 12 to 17, are treated in a similar&#13;
way as domestic government trade commodities. For example, government trade&#13;
imports of agriculture are bought in column 12 from the rest of the world&#13;
(Central Bank pool) in row 17. Import tariffs appear in row 18. The sum of&#13;
column 12 gives landed value. of agricultural imports. Subsidized value of&#13;
these imports is indicated in column 13, where subsidies appear in the&#13;
government trade account (row 16) and landed value of agricultural imports in&#13;
row 19. The remaining import columns from 14 to 17 are treated in exactly the&#13;
same way as columns 12 and 13.&#13;
The last account of this table, government trade exports appear in&#13;
columns 18 to 20. Column 18 determines the fixed price of agricultural&#13;
commodity to private producer in the same way as column 5 of this table.&#13;
Trade margins are entered at the intersection of column 19 with row 11, and&#13;
export taxes are indicated at the intersection of row 25 with column 20.&#13;
Column 20 thus represents the price at which private agricultural commodities&#13;
are sold by the government trade to the rest of the world.&#13;
4.6.2. Non-government Commodities&#13;
Tables A.1.17 and A.1.18 represent the accounting structure of non-&#13;
government commodities. In Table A.1.17 commodities are distinguished by&#13;
domestic public and private and by public and private exports. Composite&#13;
domestic commodities and composite exports are a combination of private and&#13;
public commodities presented in Table A.1.18.&#13;
Domestic public non-government commodities are presented in columns 1&#13;
to 9 in Table A.1.17. Each,column has two entries, for example, agriculture&#13;
in column 1 buys output from public activity agriculture at users cost from&#13;
row 1, and trade margins from services in row 9. The sums of columns 1 to 9&#13;
are sold from rows 17 to 25 to the domestic public rent account columns.&#13;
Columns 10 to 18 of the latter account have two entries. The diagonal entries&#13;
represent supply of domestic public non-government commodities at users cost&#13;
plus trade margins, while entries in row 26, columns 10 t? 18 indicate rents&#13;
which accrue on the capital account because of rationing.-/&#13;
Domestic private non-government commodities (columns 19 to 25) are&#13;
treated in a similar way with exception of the rent account. The diagonal&#13;
entries in these columns represent output bought from activities (at producers&#13;
cost) and entries in row 16 indicate trade margins. Public and private&#13;
exports, columns 26 to 38, are treated in exactly the same way as domestic&#13;
private commodities.&#13;
1/ Demand is available at fixed price but in rationed amount.&#13;

The accounts presented in Table A.1.18 columns 1 to 9, represent&#13;
composite domestic non-government commodities. These are valued at market&#13;
prices which are derived by summing up values of domestic public and private&#13;
commodities (including trade margins) and indirect taxes and subsidies. For&#13;
example, in column 3 (textiles), indirect taxes appear in row 1, subsides in&#13;
row 2, the value of domestic public textiles in row 6, and the value of&#13;
domestic private textiles in row 15.&#13;
Composite exports are presented in Table A.1.18, columns 10 to 16.&#13;
These are composed of public and private exports shown on diagonals in rows 20&#13;
to 32. Export taxes for oil appear in column 14. These are treated as a&#13;
receipt of the capital account in row 3.&#13;
4.6.3. Non-government Imports&#13;
Table A.1.19 represents the accounting for non-government imports.&#13;
Aggregate demand for imports is represented by the composite imports account,&#13;
columns 31 to 37. Composite imports are a sum of imports traded through the&#13;
three channels: Central Bank, commercial banks (imports premia), and own&#13;
exchange pool, plus import tariffs. Import tariffs are indicated at the&#13;
intersection of row 9 with columns 31 to 37. Central Bank imports appear on&#13;
the diagonals in rows 10 to 18; the imports premia accounts (commercial banks)&#13;
are presented in rows 28 to 36; and own exchange imports appear in rows 37 to&#13;
45. The sum of columns 31 to 37 gives aggregate demand for imports at market&#13;
prices.&#13;
Individual import channels are presented in columns 3 to 30. The&#13;
Central Bank imports are indicated in columns 3 to 9, where values in row 6&#13;
indicate the actual value of the Central Bank imports and entries in row 5&#13;
indicate premia which occurs because of the rationing of these imports.&#13;
Imports financed by the discretionary foreign exchange budget appear&#13;
in columns 10 to 16. Financial sources for these imports are indicated in&#13;
column 1 of Table A.1.18. The next import channel (commercial banks) is&#13;
presented in columns 17 to 23 where diagonal entries represent actual price of&#13;
imports and entries in row 5 indicate import premia which is due to&#13;
rationing. This import premia is allocated as receipts to urban and rural&#13;
households and public companies in column 2 in this table. Finally, own&#13;
exchange imports are presented in columns 24 to 30. As noted above, imports&#13;
from the three channels are sold from row accounts to the composite imports&#13;
accounts in order to derive the aggregate demand for imports at market prices.&#13;
The above description gives a complete documentation of the&#13;
accounting framework of the MISR2 model. The accounts also represent the&#13;
economics of the model. We now turn in the next part of this chapter to the&#13;
TV formulation and specifications of the model.&#13;
C. The MISR2 TV&#13;
The previous part of the chapter presented the accounts of the MISR2&#13;
models      organized in a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM).    As noted above each&#13;
cell of the SAM is a value of a transaction which is the outcome of agents&#13;
behaviors and constraints ensuring the consistency of these behaviors.&#13;
Formulating a model in TV amounts to: (i) giving an analytical function&#13;

explaining the behavior of each cell in the SAM and (ii) telling the&#13;
constraints imposed on each account which ensure the balancing of all accounts&#13;
and define equilibrium. In the following, a brief technical presentation of&#13;
the TV concepts and TV specifications is provided.&#13;
Let T = Ilti;i1 be a SAM with elements tij, where i is a row and j a&#13;
column index, i,j=1,2,...,n where n is the size of the SAM.     Let y = Hyiy be a&#13;
column vector of total outlays:&#13;
n&#13;
Yi =i-lI tij   &gt;    =1   2, *., .n.&#13;
to a subset of the accounts m &lt; n one can associate a price, hence a column&#13;
vector p =Ilpk1, k = 1, 2, ..., m &lt; n.    by definition, for all accounts with prices:&#13;
yi = p q   ; a vector q     Ik = llqkl, k = 1, 2, ..., m &lt; n. of quantities can&#13;
thus be defined.   Finally let p = lipi li, s = 1, 2, ..., S be a vector of parameters.&#13;
Each element tij can be associated with a function of the general formi'&#13;
tij = ti; (y, P, P)                              (1)&#13;
Providing analytical forms for the functions in (1) and telling the nature of&#13;
each variable   yi, Pk' q       endogenous, exogenous 2/ will define an economy-&#13;
wide equilibrium model.&#13;
1. The TV Specifications used in MISR2&#13;
Table 1 gives the list of specifications of the     tij (y, p, p)&#13;
functions used in the MISR2 models. Specification 1 tells that the entry tij&#13;
in column j is equal to the column sum yj.    In other--terms all the outlays of&#13;
account j are going to account i. Specification 2 simply states that the&#13;
entry tij has no specific functional forms. It is a "floating" variable which&#13;
will be determined by the over-all systems constraints. Typically if&#13;
government revenue is a function of income and government expenditure a policy&#13;
variable then government savings will be a residual and given by specification&#13;
1/  For more detailed description of the TV concepts see:     Drud, Grais and&#13;
Pyatt (1983).&#13;
2/  Or undefined.   Some accounts recording only transfers may not have a price&#13;
associated with them. One can only define the total outlays and receipts&#13;
of those accounts as values. In this case the price and quantity are&#13;
undefined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
2. Specification 3 indicates that the value of the cell is exogenous. The&#13;
function fij (e) of time 0 indicates an exogenous shift factor. When a&#13;
cell in a column behaves like a percentage share of the other elements in the&#13;
column, specification 4 will be used. This will be the case of an advalorem&#13;
tax or tarif, a fixed markup or a fixed wage-differential. Sometimes elements&#13;
in a column are specified as value shares of the column total with the&#13;
possibility of changing through time these value shares. For example, the&#13;
allocation of disposable income between savings and consumption could be&#13;
modeled in this way. Similarly the allocation of investment funds over&#13;
various investors could be represented with within-period constant value&#13;
shares. In this case specification 5 will be used. If the entry tij is a&#13;
payment for a good in completely inelastic demand, it will behave according to&#13;
specification 6: whatever the price pi, the demand by the agent represented&#13;
in column j for the commodity supplied by account i will be to     f   (e)  where&#13;
ii ij&#13;
fij (0) is a shift factor. Specification 6 will typically be used to&#13;
represent a committed demand in an expenditure system. I/ Specification 7&#13;
indicates that tij is an expenditure associated with a downward sloping export&#13;
demand function. In 7, pj is the exchange rate, Pi the supply price of home&#13;
goods, p. is the exchange rate, pi the supply price of home goods, i x the&#13;
world price in foreign currency of substitutable goods on the world market,&#13;
ni; the price-elasticity of demand and fij () a shift factor.     When the&#13;
elasticity nij takes the value zero and the world demand is completely&#13;
inelastic, specification 7 reduces to specification 8. If on the contrary the&#13;
world demand for exports is perfectly elastic, exports are determined&#13;
residually and the supply price of exports has to equal the world price times&#13;
the exchange rate. This situation will be represented by specification 9.&#13;
Let Yi be the value of imports including the import tariff, the pre-tariff&#13;
value of imports will be given by specification 10 where Pi is the exchange&#13;
rate and irm the price of imports in foreign currency. Assume that the&#13;
quantity associated with a column is a Constant Elasticity of Substitution&#13;
(CES) aggregation of the quantities associated with each cell appearing in the&#13;
column: a CES production function. Under cost minimization, the payment in&#13;
each cell of the column will behave like specification 11.     It is an&#13;
expenditure function on the inputs entering a CES production function, under&#13;
1/ See Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) for systems of consumption functions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
cost minimization.-l   Specification 19 is the same as specification 11 but&#13;
allowing for technical change through the shift function f      (e).   Specifica-&#13;
ij&#13;
tion 12 is a special case of 11 where a    = 0:   it is an expenditure function&#13;
associated with an input entering a Leontief aggregation. Specification 15 is&#13;
identical to 12 except that the share 0      is not derived from the base-year&#13;
ij&#13;
SAM and can be shifted exogenously between periods. Another rule of alloca-&#13;
tion of a column sum over the elements entering the column is given by speci-&#13;
fication 16.   The shares allocating yj are logistic functions of the real value of&#13;
the total outlay (yj/pj).    In the base year y /pj    y   and t    = ti&#13;
i   J              i     J ~~~~~ Y  ij    iji&#13;
When yj changes period changes, the shares will grow or decline&#13;
logistically according to whether pij &gt; 0 or Pij &lt; 0, respectively.      The sum&#13;
over the column of the p i   needs to satisfy f Pij = 0 to ensure additivity.&#13;
The parameter   . locates the inflection point of the logistic at B /2.&#13;
Finally, specification 22 corresponds to a Constant Elasticity of Transforma-&#13;
tion (CET) allocation across a row where ai &lt; 0.     If a firm is producing&#13;
several outputs which are aggregated into a composite output represented by a&#13;
CET, then the maximization of the revenues of the firm for a given level of&#13;
the composite output will lead to a row allocation along specification 22.&#13;
The parameters bij are such that i bij = 1 and     and 0 &lt; bij &lt; 1 ; they are&#13;
the distribution parameters in the CET aggregation. In MISR2 specification 22&#13;
is used to allocate a given amount of workers remittances in foreign currency&#13;
between two pools of foreign exchange depending on the relative exchange rates.&#13;
2. The Within-Period Module of the Reference Model of the MISR2 Class.&#13;
In part B of this chapter, the accounts of the MISR2 models were&#13;
described. All the elements of the underlying SAM were identified. In the&#13;
following we simply present the tables introduced in part B but with two&#13;
modifications: (i) to each cell in the SAM one of the specifications of table&#13;
1 is assigned and (ii) the endogenous, exogenous or undefined nature of the&#13;
price, value and quantity associated with each account is given. These two&#13;
3/&#13;
sets of information provide a complete information on the reference model.-&#13;
1/   ai &gt; 0 and a   #1.   If a     1 another specification (13) not used in&#13;
MISR2 is needed.&#13;
2/ Note that a does not depend on i and is the same across the entries in&#13;
the column. Specification 16 is derived from a generalization proposed by&#13;
Carlevaro (1976) of the Linear Expenditure System.&#13;
3/ The TV software stores these two sets of information in two files: (i)&#13;
TV-SAM file and (ii) an account-type file. For additional information on&#13;
the interpretation of the tables, see Drud, Grais and Pyatt (1983).&#13;

Chapter 3 - The Alternative MISR2 Model: Changes in Policy Regime&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
The MISR2 reference model captures the institutional arrangements and&#13;
policy regime prevalent in Egypt around the middle of 1983. In particular it&#13;
postulates fixed output prices for all public sector activities. It also&#13;
assumes that trade and other transactions with the rest of the world pass&#13;
through one of three foreign exchange pools: (i) the central bank; (ii) the&#13;
commercial banks and (iii) the "parallel" market. The first two pools have a&#13;
fixed exchange rate while the third pool has a flexible one.&#13;
One exercise undertaken with the MISR2 is to analyse the medium run&#13;
macroeconomic consequences of a reform of the public sector pricing, trade,&#13;
and exchange rate and employment regimes. The reform is designed to be&#13;
implemented over a period of between five and ten years. During the first&#13;
five years, the policy regime of 1983 is maintained but controlled adjustments&#13;
in prices, and macroeconomic variables are implemented. The purpose is to&#13;
gradually increase public sector prices in order to reduce distortions.&#13;
Prices remain however policy instruments. Beyond the fifth year, under the&#13;
presumption that the economy has acquired flexibility and agents are now more&#13;
familiar with price changes, public sector prices and employment decisions are&#13;
freed; proves either respond to excess demands or, like oil prices, follow the&#13;
world price; public sector enterprises are free to hire and fire labor at the&#13;
form of wage rate. Simultaneously to the freeing of public sector prices and&#13;
employment decisions, transactions with the rest of the world are consolidated&#13;
into two pools, instead of three, and the exchange rate on the second pool is&#13;
left free to adjust. Thus the commercial banks and "parallel markets of&#13;
foreign exchange are consolidated into one market with a free exchange rate.&#13;
The central bank is allowed to buy and sell foreign exchange from the free&#13;
market. One distortion remains there because of the difference in exchange&#13;
rates governing transactions on the two pools.&#13;
This chapter briefly outlines how, the alternative MISR2 model,&#13;
corresponding to the reformed economy differs from the reference model. We&#13;
consider first the changes in specifications pertaining to public sector&#13;
prices and then those corresponding to the reform of the trade and exchange&#13;
rate regime.&#13;
2. Liberalizing Public Sector Output Prices&#13;
Tables A.3.14 and A.3.17 and A.3.18 provide the TV specificatons when&#13;
public sector prices are free to adjust to excess demand and oil prices are&#13;
determined by world prices. First, at the bottom of table A.3.14, the account&#13;
types are changed and all prices are now specified to be endogenous.&#13;
Corresponding to the endogenization of the nine prices, one needs to&#13;
"exogenize" nine other variables in order to keep the model square.    The&#13;
natural variables to exogenize and to put identical to zero are the rents due&#13;
to the distortions. This is done for the demand-driven sectors, electricity&#13;
and services by assigning to the cells (26, 15) and (49, 26) the specification&#13;
4 instead of 2 (see table A.3.14). Specification 4 indicates the existence of&#13;
exogenous mark-up between the market price and the critical price. By driving&#13;
the mark-up to zero, the rents vanish. Along the same idea the specifications&#13;
2 in row 26 of table (A.3.17) are changed to 4.. This latter change pertains&#13;

to the supply-driven sectors. Finally for the oil sector cell (3,14) in table&#13;
(A.3.18) is also changed to 4; hence the domestic and world prices of oil will&#13;
stand in fixed proportions and the wedge can be made to vanish exogenously.&#13;
The foregoing changes, with their implications in terms of exogenous&#13;
parameters to be given to the model, change the MISR2 model into one where all&#13;
public sector prices are market determined.&#13;
3. Public Sector Employment&#13;
Another reform of the public sector is the liberalization of the&#13;
hiring of labor decisions. The envisaged reform would allow state enterprises&#13;
to hire and fire freely labor at the going wage rate. The implied change in&#13;
specifications is shown in table A.3.3. On the one hand the quantities&#13;
associated with column 2 to 10 become cudogenous reflecting the fact that&#13;
employment decisions result from the behavior of enterprises and are no longer&#13;
fixed exogenously. Simultaneously, the negative residual rents are&#13;
transformed into exogenous rent by using specification 4 in the bottom of the&#13;
table. Making these rent vanish would completely remove the distortions&#13;
introduced by the previous fixity of labor.&#13;
4. Reforming the Exchange Rate and Trade Regime&#13;
The envisaged reform involves consolidating the commercial banks and&#13;
"parallel" foreign exchange markets into one market with a flexible exchange&#13;
rate. In so doing, the rationing of imports on the commercial banks pool is&#13;
removed. The central bank pool which still has a fixed exchange rate and&#13;
fixed net borrowing from abroad clears via purchasing and selling foreign&#13;
exchange from the new consolidated market, called free market in the&#13;
following.&#13;
In terms of foreign exchange receipts and transactions between the&#13;
central bank and the free market, the flows and specifications are as shown in&#13;
table (A.3.12). Now all workers remittances come through the free market as&#13;
well as the net foreign borrowing of the private sector (direct investment).&#13;
Similarly the non-agricultual commodity exports pass through the same market&#13;
as the exports of services and transportation and communication. The central&#13;
bank buys foreign exchange from the transfer account at its own exchange&#13;
rate. The transfer account buys the foreign exchange from the free market at&#13;
the free exchange rate and channels the difference to the import premia&#13;
account. Corresponding to these changes the free market has an endogenous&#13;
price--flexible exchange rate--while the central bank and the transfer account&#13;
have the same exogenous price which is the fixed central bank exchange rate.&#13;
This is shown in the account types appearing at the bottom of the table.&#13;
The changes in terms of imports are shown in table (A.3.19). The&#13;
composite imports (columns 31 to 37) which used to come through three&#13;
channels, come now through two; the central bank imports and the imports&#13;
premia account. The former are treated as previously. The latter (in columns&#13;
17 to 23) buy now imports directly from the rest of the world (specifications&#13;
10 in row 7). Again here, like with the rents for public sector prices, the&#13;
premia are exogenized using specification 4 in row 5. As the own-exchange&#13;
market and the discretionary foreign exchange budget disappear; the accounts&#13;

With the foregoing changes in the behavior of public sector prices&#13;
and in the regime governing the transactions with the rest of the world,&#13;
another model in the MISR2 class is obtained. It corresponds to an economy&#13;
where there are less regulations and where distortions are less widespread.&#13;

CHAPTER 1: The Inter-Period Module of the Reference Model&#13;
MISR2 is a framework for policy analysis which allows to analyze the&#13;
change in the general equilibrium of the economy over a sequence of periods,&#13;
each of them covering a year. Thus, the framework can provide alternative&#13;
paths of the economy as a sequence of equilibria. The previous appendix&#13;
discussed how equilibrium in each period is defined. The linkages between the&#13;
equilibria in the various periods are taken up here.&#13;
In each period equilibrium is obtained under specific assumptions on&#13;
resource endowments (land, labor, capital), policy measures and trends in the&#13;
rest of the world. It is the modification of these assumptions which shift&#13;
the equilibrium from period to period.&#13;
1. Resource Endowments&#13;
Consider first the change in resource endowments. Land is a factor&#13;
of production intervening in both public and private agriculture. Expansion&#13;
of land means a potential for the expansion of the supply of agricultural&#13;
goods. As is well known, land is a very scarce factor in Egypt. Its&#13;
availability changes because of two phenomena: (i) land reclamation and (ii)&#13;
urbanization. The former tends to expand the availability of land to&#13;
agriculture while the latter constrains it. The net change in land&#13;
availability is thus the outcome of a rather complex set of decisions. The&#13;
MISR2 framework does not focus on these issues and allows to shift&#13;
independently the availability of land according to the best judgement of the&#13;
analyst.&#13;
Each of the production activities has a certain capacity of&#13;
production defined by its capital stock. This capacity increases via&#13;
investment which expands the capital stock. At the beginning of each period&#13;
each activity inherits a new capital stock which is equal to the one it had&#13;
the preceding period, net of depreciaton, plus any new investment which the&#13;
activity made. Investment is driving the capital stock. The determination of&#13;
investment differs between the public and private sectors. As was mentioned,&#13;
the value of public investment is a decision variable while the private sector&#13;
invests whatever funds are available to it. The allocation of investment&#13;
between various public sector activities is again a planning decision, while&#13;
the allocation of investment in the private sector responds to relative rates&#13;
of returns.&#13;
The MISR2 framework assumes the existence of a rural and an urban&#13;
labor market. On the former labor supply is assumed given in each period and&#13;
the rural wage adjusts within the period to clear the market. The labor&#13;
supply in rural areas shifts between periods because of two factors: (i) the&#13;
natural rate of growth of the rural labor force and (ii) migration to urban&#13;
areas. The first factor expands the labor supply and is given exogenously.&#13;
Migration slows down the growth in the rural labor supply. The amount of&#13;
migration is determined according to a modified version of the Harris-Todaro&#13;
explanation (see Dervis, de Melo, Robinson [1982]): the higher the expected&#13;
urban wage relative to the rural wage, the more important the migration flow&#13;
will be. Migration to urban areas adds to the natural expansion of the urban&#13;
labor force to form urban labor supply. Within the period, this labor supply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 193 -&#13;
exceeds labor demand at a fixed nominal wage. There is unemployment. The&#13;
fixed nominal urban wage shifts between periods according to a Philipps curve&#13;
explanation augmented with inflationary expectations. Thus when the urban&#13;
unemployment goes up, the increase in the nominal wage slows down. However,&#13;
the full increase in the urban consumer price index of last period is passed&#13;
on the wage of the next period. Thus urban real wages are cut by "inflation"&#13;
within each period but catch up with a lag. They are fully indexed to the&#13;
"inflation" of previous periods.&#13;
Apart from the expansion of land, labor and capital, production&#13;
activities can see their resource endowments increase through increases in&#13;
productivity. Hicks-neutral technical change is assumed for all production&#13;
activities. The rates of technical change are provided exogenously. A higher&#13;
rate of technical change allows, for a given level of production, a lower&#13;
marginal cost and hence an increase in the profitability of the activity.&#13;
The level of oil production is not strictly speaking a "resource&#13;
endowment," it is however exogenous. Changes in the output level of oil&#13;
contribute to the shifts in the general equilibrium of the economy between&#13;
periods. The growth in oil production has to be assumed according to the best&#13;
available information.&#13;
2. Policy Measures&#13;
Decision makers in the MISR2 framework react to a certain number of&#13;
policy signals. Their reactions, jointly with the constraints imposing the&#13;
consistency of the outcome of all their decisions, result in an economy-wide&#13;
equilibrium. Shifts in the policy signals induce agents' reactions and lead&#13;
to a new equilibrium. Thus policy signals are another set of variables which&#13;
make the economy move along a sequential equilibrium path.&#13;
The policy instruments captured in the MISR2 reference model are the&#13;
following:&#13;
(i) pricing of the production of the public sector activites;&#13;
(ii)  prices at whi h the government (GASC) buys goods from domestic&#13;
agriculture;-&#13;
(iii) selling prices of the subsidized items;&#13;
(iv) levels of rationing of the subsidized commodities;&#13;
(v) the exchange rates governing transactions on the central bank and&#13;
commercial banks foreign exchange pools;&#13;
(vi) the wage and employment policies in the government and state&#13;
enterprises;&#13;
(vii)  tax rates for both direct and indirect taxation;&#13;
1/ GASG is the Government Authority for the supply of commodities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 194 -&#13;
(viii) government current expenditures on goods and services,&#13;
(ix)  government investment;&#13;
(x) public enterprises overall investment and its allocation,&#13;
(xi) net borrowing from abroad through the central and commercial banks&#13;
pools;&#13;
(xii) the allocation of foreign exchange over commodity-imports in the&#13;
"discretionary" foreign exchange budget."&#13;
3. The Rest of the World&#13;
A last set of variables which bear on the equilibrium reached in each&#13;
period and/or its shifts between periods are the rest of the world&#13;
variables. World prices of both imports and exports and the state of the&#13;
world economy affect the equilibrium of the Egyptian economy. Outstanding&#13;
among these variables are: (i) the trends in oil prices; (ii) shifts in the&#13;
prices of imported subsidized commodities; (iii) the volume of traffic through&#13;
the Suez Canal; (iv) inflow of tourists and (v) the amounts remitted by&#13;
Egyptians working abroad. With views on the likely trends in this "world&#13;
environment," the MISR2 framework allows to derive the macroeconomic and&#13;
resource allocation implications.&#13;
CHAPTKR 2: The Formulation of the Inter-Period Module of MISR2&#13;
Appendix 1 described the general equilibrium which is obtained within&#13;
one period. This equilibrium is conditional on resource endowments, policy&#13;
parameters, structural parameters and the world environment. These variables&#13;
as discussed in chapter 1 of this appendix define conditions considered fixed&#13;
within one period but which may vary between periods. Their inter-period&#13;
variations drive the MISR2 models dynamically. Some of these variations are&#13;
assumed to follow exogeneously determined trends, others may be the outcome of&#13;
behavioral decisions and depend on results obtained in previous periods.&#13;
In the following we present the specifications governing the non-&#13;
exogenous inter-period variations. They pertain to investment and capital&#13;
stocks accumulation on the one hand and to rural-urban migration and urban&#13;
wage determination on the other hand.&#13;
1. Fixed Capital Formation and Capital Stock Accumulation&#13;
As mentioned in appendix one and formulated in the previous chapter&#13;
the capital formation of public sector activities and the government are fixed&#13;
in nominal terms in each period. Private sector activities are thought to be&#13;
financially constrained and to invest an amount equal to the value of finance&#13;
they are able to obtain. The question which arises is that of the allocation&#13;
of the total funds available to the private sector over the various&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 195 -&#13;
One can think of a financial sector which allocates a total amount of&#13;
resources across various activities.    Let (TFI)t be the total financial&#13;
resources available to the private sector, then&#13;
Pit It     a,t(TFI)t  i = 1, 2, ..., n                             (1)&#13;
where lit is investment in volume, Pit the price of investment, ait is the&#13;
share of financial resources going to sector i (I ai     = 1), and n the total&#13;
number of private activities.    Formally, the quetion is how are the ait, i =&#13;
1, 2, ..., n determined and how do they change over time. Dervis, De Melo and&#13;
Robinson (1982) suggest the following specification 1/:&#13;
R        -AR&#13;
a  SP               -            t-1 ),   = 1,2,...nt-2&#13;
it   Si(t_l) + p SPi(t 1)(      AR(t-l)  tl                        2&#13;
where SPit is a sectoral share in aggregate profits, p is a parameter&#13;
indicating intersectoral "mobility" of financial resources, Rit is a sectoral&#13;
profit rate ad ARt is the average profit rate. Specification (2) indicates&#13;
that if there is no "mobility" of funds across sectors ji = 0 , any difference&#13;
between the sectoral profit rate and the average profit rate will not affect&#13;
the share of funds allocated to the sector. Furthermore this share will be&#13;
equal to the last period share of the sector in aggregate profits. With&#13;
"mobility" of funds, sectors with profit rates higher than average will pull&#13;
resources over and above their respective profit shares whereas the sectors&#13;
with lower than average profit rates would give up resources. Thus&#13;
with p &gt; 0, relations (2) allow for allocation shares ait to respond to&#13;
relative profitability.   The variability of the ait in (2) is around sectoral&#13;
shares in aggregate profits:    SPi(t1).   The underlying idea here is that if&#13;
there were no "mobility" of funds (p = 0) and if all profits were saved, then&#13;
the investment undertaken by each activity would be self-financed. Thus (2)&#13;
is broadly based on the idea that savings come essentially from profits and&#13;
1/   0 &lt; SPit &lt; I and ESP       1 hence Eat = 1 for all p's.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 196 -&#13;
that firms get more or less than their available resources according to their&#13;
relative profitability and to the "mobility" of funds. However, in MISR2&#13;
relation 2 would be applied to shares allocating funds available to private&#13;
activities between the latter. Hence the link between the funds which each&#13;
activity would receive, its profits, and eventual savings is more remote than&#13;
what is implicit in (2). Furthermore, the mechanism assumed in MISR2 is that&#13;
the financial sector allocates across private activities a given amount of&#13;
funds. It seems difficult to assume that such a financial sector would be&#13;
able to have a good idea of aggregate private profits and hence of an average&#13;
profit rate in the whole private economy, weighted by sectoral profit&#13;
shares. A reasonable approach would be to assume: (i) that the financial&#13;
sector knows the allocations of funds it has made in past periods, (ii) that&#13;
it is provided with individual profit rates for each private activity, and&#13;
(iii) that based on previous allocations of funds, it uses available profit&#13;
rates to fix an average profit rate for its activities in the private&#13;
sector. These assumptions would lead to a respecification of (2):&#13;
ait   ai(t-1) + P Si(t-l)(                             2,..., n,    (3)&#13;
R(t-1)&#13;
where 0i(t 1) are the shares used in last period to allocate the&#13;
funds, Ri(t 1) are sectoral profit rates, p is still a "mobility" of funds&#13;
parameter and&#13;
n&#13;
R        =E            R       .(4)&#13;
(t-l)   i=l i(t-l)    Ri(t-W)                                      4&#13;
Given (4), (2) obviously satifies the activity constraint E'it = 1.&#13;
Relations (3) tell the following story: the financial sector has some inertia&#13;
in its allocation of funds, however at each period it reviews the performance&#13;
of private activities and according to the extent of the "mobility" of funds&#13;
it reorients its financing between various private activities. To complete&#13;
the specification of (3), one needs to define more precisely the sectoral&#13;
profit rates Ri. Let Pi(t 1) Ki(t 1) be the value of the capital stock, in&#13;
sector i, at the end of period t-1, let 'S be the rate of depreciation in the&#13;
sector i and   OS   be the gross operating surplus in sector i, in period t,&#13;
it&#13;
the profit rate Rit is defined as 1/:&#13;
1/ This formulation of Rit ignores capital gains..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Osit   i(t-1)  i  i(t-1)&#13;
Rit         P       K,i= 1, 2,...,n                                 (5)&#13;
Once investment decisions are made, the capital endowements for the&#13;
next period are derived. This is done in the same way for all production&#13;
activities whether in the private or public sectors. Let Ijt by the amount of&#13;
capital formation going into sector j, then:&#13;
K.        =  I   + (1- 6.) K.                                       (6)&#13;
j(t+1)      Ijt + (jt &#13;
where Kj is the capital stock of sector ; and 6. is a rate of depreciation&#13;
which is sector specific. The index t is for time.&#13;
2. Rural-Urban Migration and Urban Wage Determination&#13;
Two labor markets are captured in MISR2: rural and urban labor&#13;
markets. Rural households supply labor services to the former and urban&#13;
households to the latter. Migration is assumed to take place from rural to&#13;
urban areas and is described by the following equation:&#13;
we&#13;
MIGt '        -  1} LRt                                             (7)&#13;
R&#13;
where Wu is the expected urban wage -/ and WR is the rural wage. The higher&#13;
the parameter y &gt; 0 and the stronger is the response of migration to the wage&#13;
differential. In (7) LRt is the rural labor supply. The formulation (7) is a&#13;
variation on the Harris-Todaro version since it does require the equalization&#13;
of the expected urban wage with the rural wage. Rural labor supply will be&#13;
given by:&#13;
LRt = (1 + gR   LR(t_l) - MIGt _1                                   (8)&#13;
1/  We = W (1-p)   where W   is the actual urban wage and p the urban&#13;
unemployment rate.   Specification (7) is also used in the Domestic&#13;
Resource Mobilization model of Egypt (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 198 -&#13;
where gR is the actual rate of growth of the rural labor force. I/      Similarly,&#13;
the urban labor supply will be:&#13;
L   = (1 + gMIG t-1(9)&#13;
where gu is the natural rate of growth of the urban labor force. Given labor&#13;
demand on the urban areas, using (9) one can derive unemployment and the rate&#13;
of unemployment:&#13;
L    -   LD&#13;
p =  utu                                                            (10)&#13;
ut&#13;
where LDut is urban labor demand and p is the urban rate of unemployment.&#13;
In the within-period reference model of the MISR2 class it is assumed&#13;
that urban labor supply is perfectly elastic at the going wage. This implies&#13;
the existence of unemployment as described by (10) and assumes a fixed urban&#13;
wage in each period. That wage is allowed to change between periods according&#13;
to the level of the rate of unemployment and to inflationary expectations&#13;
consistent with a Philips curve explanation augmented with inflationary&#13;
expectations:&#13;
wt = t-1 (1 +z      v)                                              (1&#13;
where z is a function of the rate of unemployment and v is the expected rate&#13;
of increase of the urban Consumer Price Index (CPI). The specification chosen&#13;
for z is:&#13;
z = aO - ai exp [-B/(p - P)],                                       (12)&#13;
where 0 &lt; aO &lt; 1, 0 &lt; a 1 &lt; l and     &gt; 0 are parameters and p the frictional&#13;
rate of unemployment corresponding to a tight urban labor market. When the&#13;
1/ It is possible to adjust relation (8) and (9) to take into account&#13;
international labor migration. Here it is assumed that net migration in&#13;
the eighties will not have a major impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 199 -&#13;
rate of unemployment p tends towards the frictional rate p, the unemployment&#13;
induced rate of increase in wages will tend to aO:&#13;
limit z = aO&#13;
P+p&#13;
similarly when the rate of unemployment increases substantially, z will&#13;
gradually decrease to aO - a1      The parameter a will indicate ,/ the speed at&#13;
which z varies between aO and a0- a1. Thus when the rate of unemployment&#13;
increases the pressure for the increase of the urban wage will disminish; on&#13;
the contrary when the urban labor market is tight a maximum rate of wage&#13;
increase (a0) is approached. The expression between brackets in (11) has an&#13;
additional term (v) representing "inflationary" expectation. A simple&#13;
specification reflecting the full adjustment of the wage to the "inflation" of&#13;
last period is adopted for v&#13;
PC&#13;
'Vt&#13;
t PCt 1&#13;
where PCt is the urban CPI and t is a time index. 2/&#13;
1/ Naturally Max {p} = 1. Relation (12) is a downward sloping logistic with&#13;
an inflexion point at 0/2.&#13;
2/     t indicates the inflationary expectation held at the end of period t for&#13;
period t + 1.&#13;

            Macroeconomic effects of efficiency pricing
            in the public sector in Egypt
        </repnme>

            This paper presents an economy-wide
            framework, called MISR2, that provides a general equilibrium
            evaluation of these costs &amp; hence of distortions. (MISR
            is the Arabic name for Egypt. MISR2 is a more disaggregated
            &amp; technically advanced follow-up to MISR1, which is a
            very simple aggregative model using the Transaction Value
            (TV) approach.) The MISR2 framework is designed to analyze
            the short- to medium-term macroeconomic consequences of
            policies aimed at minimizing the costs of the misallocation
            &amp; distortions. The framework was used to analyze two
            sets of policy interventions: (1) adjustments of regulated
            prices &amp; quantities within the same policy regime, that
            is, with the regulated variables remaining controlled; &amp;
            (2) adjustments in the policy regime itself, an approach
            that implies freeing controlled prices &amp; quantities
            &amp; letting market forces determine them. In MISR2 the
            focus is on four areas of economic intervention: (1) pricing
            of output in the public sector, (2) employment &amp; wage
            policy in the public sector, (3) the trade &amp; exchange
            rates. rate regime; &amp; (4) rationing &amp; subsidization
            as relates to households. In this paper, MISR2 is used
            mainly to analyze the effects of adjustments in public
            sector prices &amp; in the regimes governing trade &amp;
            exchange rates.
