            Private sector development in Belarus
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Belarus has moved very slowly to
            dismantle its state enterprises and associated trading
            monopolies. Nevertheless, a private sector clearly is
            emerging. A recent World Bank survey shows that so far the
            private sector has developed through three basic channels:
            1) start-ups; 2) 100 percent buyouts; and 3) spin-offs.
            Belarus requires a comprehensive strategy to create a more
            conducive environment for private sector activities. This
            Note explains the approach the Bank used for designing such
            a strategy in Belarus, and it identifies three critical
            constraints to enterprise development: rudimentary business
            strategies, ill-defined property rights, and limited
            availability of investment credit in the high-inflation
            environment. The private sector survey showed that it is not
            enough to set up legal infrastructure and institutions.
            Faster privatization and the tightening of subsidized
            credits to enterprises need to be implemented together with
            regulatory reforms and the business centers.
