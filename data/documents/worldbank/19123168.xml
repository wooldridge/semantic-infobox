&#13;
    The assumption that communities can and will manage                            DEWATS as a scalable urban sanitation option should be&#13;
    facilities and wastewater treatment on their own without                       developed only in the context of a bigger picture that maps&#13;
    external support is overstated. Community-based organi-                        where decentralized systems fit into a broader city sanita-&#13;
    zations lose enthusiasm; desludging is neglected; and even                     tion strategy: which areas will be integrated into evolving&#13;
    the most committed users are reluctant to fund major re-                       centralized sewer systems, and within what time frames,&#13;
    pairs and refurbishment on their own. Sustained use of the                     and which areas are likely to remain stand-alone decentral-&#13;

    are unlikely without external monitoring and support for&#13;
    technical and non-technical problem solving.                                   Decentralized systems that can be operated and managed&#13;
                                                                                   by users are much more likely to reach the poor in the short&#13;
    Community management should be reconceived as co-man-                          and medium term than the centralized piped systems and&#13;
    agement, where user communities take responsibility for rou-                   treatment works that prioritize central business and dense&#13;
    tine operation and maintenance, and local government and its                   downtown areas first.&#13;
    partners provide greater technical and non-technical support.&#13;
    Sustained improvements in sanitation and hygiene practices                     In summary, community-managed DEWATS can be effective&#13;
    require ongoing reinforcement, support and monitoring.                         for serving poor communities where the appropriate type of&#13;

    documented elsewhere1; this assessment is more concerned                              from nearly 400 sites implemented between 2003 and&#13;
    with whether operation and management of DEWATS by                                    2011 (representing about 70% of the DEWATS developed&#13;

        Box 1: Community-Managed Dewats in Indonesia&#13;
&#13;
        Thousands of community-managed DEWATS are being developed across Indonesia. Government funds most of the&#13;
        infrastructure development, and project implementation has a strong emphasis on community engagement and em-&#13;
        powerment. There are three main types. The majority are colorful tiled community sanitation centers (CSCs), with toi-&#13;
        lets, washing and laundry facilities. Alternatively, wastewater is collected from households by a simpliï¬&#129;ed sewer system&#13;
        (SSS), with the treatment infrastructure often built under the road to save space and lower costs in dense settlements.&#13;
        A small minority offers both a local sewer network and a communal sanitation facility, and serves households that&#13;
        have their own toilet and washing facilities as well as those that do not. Each system typically serves between 20 and&#13;
        100 households, and is managed by a small committee of residents who are responsible for long-term operation and&#13;
        maintenance.&#13;

Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s urban sanitation challenges are acute. Half of           investment in sewer infrastructure has been low. Seventy-&#13;

    Poor sanitation is holding back Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s human and eco-                       Local government is formally responsible for ensuring the&#13;
    nomic development. The real annual economic cost of poor                         availability of basic services, but gives sanitation low prior-&#13;
    sanitation in Indonesia has been quantified as US$6.3 bil-                       ity. Urban sanitation is almost entirely private and on-site,&#13;
    lion (2006 figures), equivalent to 2.3% of GDP. Poor sani-                       and there is little institutional capacity yet to manage sani-&#13;

      conï¬&#129;ned catchment area in a region, decentralization simply means the break-up of the catchment area into smaller&#13;
      areas (IWA, n.d.). The smallest possible decentralized system is an on-site facility.&#13;
      Decentralized systems vary in size, and include a range of technologies â&#128;&#147; aerobic, anaerobic or combined systems;&#13;
      attached or dispersed media; passive or active systems, and so on. In this review, DEWATS is used to refer speciï¬&#129;cally&#13;
      to passive anaerobic treatment systems.&#13;
      The DEWATS used in Indonesia are typically one of the following:&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Communal septic tank&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Biodigester plus anaerobic bafï¬&#130;ed reactor plus anaerobic ï¬&#129;lter&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Settler plus anaerobic bafï¬&#130;ed reactor plus anaerobic ï¬&#129;lter&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Proprietary system using a permutation of the above systems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      To date, anaerobic bafï¬&#130;ed reactors (ABRs), have been the most commonly used technology in Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s community-&#13;
      managed DEWATS programs.&#13;
      DEWATS plants may include secondary and tertiary aerobic and anaerobic treatment in planted gravel ï¬&#129;lters and/or&#13;
      ponds. None of the domestic systems reviewed here uses planted gravel ï¬&#129;lters or ponds, primarily because of space&#13;
      constraints in dense settlements. The treated efï¬&#130;uent is piped to an open drain, river or canal.&#13;
      Anaerobic wastewater treatment systems have no moving parts, low running costs and, with adequate training and&#13;
      support, can be operated and managed by the user community itself.&#13;

Key findings and recommendations are grouped into four                settlements with a strong ethic of voluntary service&#13;

KEY FINDINGS:                                                         have been desludged to date. Desludging does not&#13;

   â&#128;¢ Over 80% of installations are functioning well                   genial facilities and sewer networks that drain well&#13;

     by an NGO; some are run informally by an adjacent&#13;
     mosque or by users, or are overseen by the head of&#13;
     the neighborhood administration. About 10% of fa-&#13;
     cilities are completely dysfunctional and not in use.&#13;
     Simplified sewer systems appear to be the most resil-&#13;
     ient in the face of weak management, as they require&#13;
     the least maintenance and income and do not need a&#13;
     full-time operator.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Community management approaches are more&#13;
     effective in some areas than in others, and are&#13;
     vulnerable to changes in community leadership.&#13;
     Management structures work particularly well in&#13;

  Box 3: Mainstreaming DEWATS into Integrated Wastewater and Septage Management&#13;
&#13;
  The city of Makassar is building the institutional framework for an integrated sanitation, septage and wastewater util-&#13;
  ity. It began by setting up a mobile support team in its Human Settlements Department to provide post-construction&#13;
  support to community-managed DEWATS. In mid-2012, it transferred the team to a new technical service unit with&#13;
  responsibility for monitoring and supporting DEWATS, providing a desludging service and managing septage and&#13;
  drainage in the city. The mobile support team continues to work closely with Health and Community Development staff.&#13;
  From 2014 the unit will be restructured to also manage the new centralized sewerage and treatment system being&#13;
  built to serve the cityâ&#128;&#153;s central business and recreation district. In time the organization could become a full commercial&#13;
  utility company straddling centralized and decentralized wastewater management, septage collection and treatment&#13;
  and drainage.&#13;

 The majority of DEWATS are functioning well day to day.          The cost-effectiveness of DEWATS is shaped primarily by&#13;
 The sustainability of service provision with community-man-      the number of people using a particular facility. Where the&#13;
 aged DEWATS is vulnerable to a range of challenges: varying      number of users per site is above 50 households, the average&#13;
 levels of motivation by community management structures,         cost is substantially lower than centralized systems. Simpli-&#13;
 inadequate operating income to cover major repairs, limited      fied sewer and combined systems retain higher usage rates&#13;

            Review of community-managed decentralized
            wastewater treatment systems in Indonesia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Effective management of sanitation and
            wastewater is a growing challenge in dense urban
            settlements. Rapidly increasing urbanization and, along with
            that, rising settlement densities in low-income urban and
            peri-urban areas highlight the need for sanitation
            technologies and management systems that are robust and
            affordable, and which lessen the pollution load on local
            water sources. In many developing countries, centralized
            sewerage and wastewater treatment systems cover only a
            portion of larger urban areas, and are often not yet planned
            for smaller towns and densely populated, low-income areas of
            cities. On-site sanitation is often inappropriate in the
            denser settlements and slum areas, thus requiring
            intermediate and complementary solutions. Decentralized
            wastewater treatment systems (DEWATS) connected to
            simplified sewer systems or communal sanitation centers have
            the potential to close the gap between on-site and
            centralized systems. Community-managed DEWATS offer the
            possibility of swift sanitation improvements in high
            priority neighborhoods that communities can manage
            themselves, where local government does not yet provide a
            full sanitation service. This review explores
            Indonesia's experience in implementing
            community-managed DEWATS on a growing scale, and more
            specifically, whether community-managed DEWATS are a viable
            urban sanitation option for serving poor households in dense settlements.
