                              Robert W. Oliver                                 progra.s because of sudden short falls in their export earnings.         This&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER;     We were talking last week, Irving, about the role of the           waa clearly related to the problem of commodities and terms of trade&#13;
&#13;
Economics Department end the people who served in the Economics                which had been one of the major issues well known and studied for&#13;
&#13;
Department, but I think we didn't pin down so.e of the important               decades in development economics and development finance.&#13;
&#13;
achieve.ents in thet period of time.     It might be well, therefore, to               The resolution was, as I understood it at the time, a compromise&#13;
&#13;
begin our conversation today by my simply asking you to aey a bit more         between those who wanted to deal with commodity problems through&#13;
&#13;
about the Supple.entary Finance ScheRe, which was a major undertaking          international commodity agreements, like the Coffee Agreement or the&#13;
&#13;
of that time, and, if it is appropriate, how that proposal differed            Sugar Agreement, and those who did not want to deal with the COIDIJlodity&#13;
&#13;
from Sector Adjuatment Loana, which are being made by the Bank today,          problem and felt that any attempt to stabilize prices or the earnings&#13;
&#13;
and from other schemes which approach balance-of-payments or program,          of commodity   e~porta   was really poor econom1c policy.   The latter&#13;
&#13;
aa distinct fro. project, financing.                                           countries agreed that commodity stabilization was not in the best&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Supplementary finance waa one of the first assignment&amp; on my     interest of developing countries.      This had been a raging intellectual&#13;
&#13;
deek when 1 ca-e to the Bank in '64, and it remained an active                 argument for a long tiâ&#128;¢e, and out of this UNCTAD conference, which I&#13;
&#13;
aeaignment until 1969 or 1970.     Wood&amp; waa in the Bank, and it waa one       did not attend, ca.e this resolution on unexpected export abort falls.&#13;
&#13;
of the .oat U.portant things we were doing.       It was not a8 important 88   (1   had been familiar with these controversies from my previous&#13;
&#13;
the IDA Repleniahment -- 1 don't want to exaggerate; but, at leaat in          experience.)&#13;
&#13;
the econo-ica wort, and also in the general activities of the Bank, it                Well, the resolution had been wo.rded in such a way that the World&#13;
&#13;
was a major activity which waa going on.       You will excuse me if I         Bank was asked to do a study about this.      We were asked to evaluate the&#13;
&#13;
de&amp;cribe some of theae thingâ&#128;¢ in so.e detail.       I don't know whether       proposal and make recommendations to the UNCTAD. We could not take the&#13;
&#13;
history "ill regard it aa a minor event.       It was not a minor event at     unanimous vote of the UNCTAD resolution as indicating that all member&#13;
&#13;
the time.                                                                      countries were prepared to do something along the lines ol the&#13;
&#13;
      One of the few things that was agreed at the UNCTAD Conference           resolution, but that they were prepared seriously to consider a      ~tudy&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            3                                                                                       4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and recommendations by the World Bank.                                         it    ~aâ&#128;¢   in that spirit that we tackled the subject.&#13;
&#13;
     People who were preaeot told ae, and froa the written recorda of                  It waa tackled by ju8t a few of us in the Bank.         It did not become&#13;
&#13;
the UNCTAD it aeeaed pretty clear, that it vaa expected that if                a general project of the Bank.          I had a small group of about three or&#13;
&#13;
something was to be done, it would be aoaething that the World Bank waa        four people,      who   ~orked   with me on it.    They were my think-tank&#13;
&#13;
going to do.   It vaan't a queation of aaking a atudy for somebody else        research arm.      We discussed our thoughts with other people in the 6ank,&#13;
&#13;
to do aomethiog.   Thia had a lot of importance for the future, because        but it did not become a general activity in the 6aok.               It was a good&#13;
&#13;
of the que.tiona: ''Why ian't the loternationd Monetary Fund doing             eKample of what I was doing in the Bank because, as I think I mentioned&#13;
&#13;
this?"   How doea it relate to the Fund'a Coapenaatory Financing     Sche~ne   to you before, l was not doing things which the 6ank was already doing.&#13;
&#13;
1n which I had been quite involved when I vaa in the Monetary Fund.                        The proposal itself came out as a Bank staff study, not in         th~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     This resolution of UNCTAD vas in the spirit of finding additional         names of the authors.        I wanted to be able to say that it was a study&#13;
&#13;
waya of providing development finance for the developing countriea.            that had the backing of the World Bank and vas not just an individual&#13;
&#13;
Indeed, reading the legialative history of the UNCTAD conference and           proposal.         forget how long the study took exactly, but I'm sure it&#13;
&#13;
talking to people who vere deeply involved, it vaa fundamentally               vas at least aix montha.&#13;
&#13;
thought of aa a way of increasing IDA-type funds, i.e. not only       long-    OLIVER:       Hay I interrupt to ask who were the other members of the&#13;
&#13;
tera development finance, but on very conceaaiooal terms.       Thil vas a     econoaica at4ff who worked with you?&#13;
&#13;
period of tiae Â¥hen people were thinking about how ways and means might        FRIEDMAN: The ones that I         reme~ber,   and 1 have a feeling that I may not&#13;
&#13;
be found to expand the flow of grant-type funds to the poorer                  have remembered all, were         Thalwit~,   who is now a Vice President for&#13;
&#13;
developing countries.   This ia essential to an underatanding of the           Africa in the World Bank, and Ravi Gulhati. I have a feeling there was&#13;
&#13;
diacua1iona, analyaea and negotiations on Supplementary Finance.               a third person alao, vhoae name escapes me.            Of course, as in all these&#13;
&#13;
     At this tiae, Prebiach was the head of UNCTAD, I had known him for        thinge, I talked to Andy Kamarck. In a sense, Andy was sort of a common&#13;
&#13;
many years, and I knew that he vas hopeful that, within the framework          factor in anything that I did at that time.&#13;
&#13;
of this Supplementary Finance Reaolution, it would be possible to find                 The basic approach in the study was that to devt&gt;lopw .. nt plauning&#13;
&#13;
additional ways to provide   develo~nt   finance for the development           it    ~as   neceaaary to have a view of what export earnings were going to&#13;
&#13;
countries, more particularly on a conceasional basis.    He saw the            be.     From the projection of export t&gt;arnings, many       oth~r    projections&#13;
&#13;
opportunity for creating another vehicle for development finance, and          followed. Just as with a capital- output ratio, it is one ot the basic&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                     6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
assu.ptiona in any kind of analyaia           o~   of any kind of modeling.        The   favor of it.&#13;
&#13;
p~ojection     of export earnings     ~â&#128;¢â&#128;¢   a baaia   fo~    planning even if it         OLIVER:     Of doing the atudy7&#13;
&#13;
proved inaccurate. We did a considerable hiatorical investigation and                    FRIEDMAN:     Well, of doing the study and of the propoaal we then made to&#13;
&#13;
found that the projections used had proved not to be particularly                        the UNCTAD.     We welcomed the notion that it was something that the&#13;
&#13;
accurate even though, at the tiae they             ~ere   aade, they were thought to     World Bank would do.     He thought the World Bank ought to take a lead in&#13;
&#13;
be well made, carefully aade.          Becauee of the uncertaintiee and                  thia kind of thing -- in     intellectual discueaiona and policy&#13;
&#13;
difficulties in making auch projectionâ&#128;¢, countrieâ&#128;¢ found theaaelves,                     leadership.     He also liked the idea that it was going to become another&#13;
&#13;
froâ&#128;¢ time to time, in difficulty, becauae their export earnings were                     reaeon for eapandiog IDA,     ln the meantime, we were getting into the&#13;
&#13;
not aa planned and there had to be adjuâ&#128;¢tâ&#128;¢enta in their                develo~ent        IDA discuaaiona which we can talk about separately.      It waa, as he aaw&#13;
&#13;
programs.      The queltion vaa "How can      ~e    adjuat in 1uch a way ao aa not       it, an additional reason for expanding JDA.&#13;
&#13;
to disrupt the develop.ent programs?"              Well, I   ~on't   â&#128;¢-rh:e the               I alao found him completely supporting the idea that the World&#13;
&#13;
propoaal     fo~   you, becauae tbe   p~opoaal     iâ&#128;¢ a document that you can read.      Bank ought play a role in influencing economic policy in        differ~nt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
You can see for youreelf what you think of it.                 It val published.         countries, which waa an intrinsic part of our Supplementary Finance&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      In what year?                                                               Program.     He accepted the idea that to have influence, it     ~as   necessary&#13;
&#13;
FliEDJIAB:     Oh I would aay, 1966.                                                     to be able to help the countries.     Supplementary Finance was one of the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      And could I also aak, what waa the year of the UNCTAD                       vebiclea that would provide the Bank an opportunity to have an&#13;
&#13;
Conference that requeated thia atudy7                                                    important role in the macro-economic management of its borrowing&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDKAM:      1964.    The first UHCTAD Conference was in 1960, but I think             members.     Beyond project and aector management, the Supplementary&#13;
&#13;
it waa the '64 conference that actually paaaed the resolution.                     It    Finance 1cheme waa an invitation to the Bank to be concerned with what&#13;
&#13;
happened before I came to the Bank.            The date baa to be checked out to         happened to a whole development program in case of adverse changes 1n&#13;
&#13;
be certain, but the resolution had been paaaed before 1 arrived at the                   the external sectors of a country -- a frequent occurrence in&#13;
&#13;
Bank.                                                                                    developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      Did you have a feeling that Hr. Woods had a pro            o~   con         OLIVEt:     Did you agree that this was an activity that the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
attitude toward it?                                                                      take on instead of the Fund?      or in addition to the Fund?&#13;
&#13;
FR.IEDHAH:     I discussed it thoroughly with him, and he was very much in               FRIEDMAN:     When we made the proposal, we found that we sroused       ~om~&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  7                                                                            8&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
hostility on the part of certain elements in the Monetary Fund.            I      strongly, vhy didn't they increase Compensatory Financing and try to&#13;
never did find out, Bob, bow vide-apread the hostility vaa, but it got            â&#128;¢ake Compeneatory Financing an adequate substitute for Supplementary&#13;

&#13;
denouncing it on the ground&amp; that it vas of no buaineas to the World                   The veakneas vas on the U. S. aide.      Tony Solomon was Assistant&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     The World Bank vas not in the buaineaa of adviaing on macro-            Secretary of State for Econo.ic Affairs, and I had many diacuasiona&#13;

econo-ic . . nagement.    That vaa for the Monetary Fund.      There already      with Tony.     Tony was influenced, not by concern for the Fund, but by an&#13;

aeked why I vaa nov doing thing&amp; vhich were going to undercut the Fund            which vaâ&#128;¢ to the effect that it was good for countries to have&#13;

Frank Southard, the Fund'a Deputy Managing Director, whom I had known             terms of trade, and thia vaa desirable from the point of view of&#13;
&#13;
from the 1940a, called me to aay -- I forget the exact vorda, "You have           inducing the right kind of economic development.&#13;

betrayed the Fund.       You uaed to be one of ita atrong advocates and           OLIVER:     That sounds like the old argument for unbalanced growth.&#13;
&#13;
nov you're trying to build up the Bank through Supplementary Finance."            FRIEDMAN:     Exactly.   Actually, at that time, I contributed a book&#13;

Hy anaver to Frank Southard at the time vas, "If the Fund felt so                 review of a book by Paul Streeten, on balanced versus unbalanced&#13;

&#13;
        Thia, of   cou~ae,   is sn iaeue that exists to this day, because no                    This Supplementary Finance proposal was very active in the UNCTAD&#13;
&#13;
equivalent to aupple-entary finance has ever come into existence.                All   until after Woods left.           It was finally put on the shelf by McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
the compensatory or balance-of-payments schemes are still baaed on the                 OLIVER:     It sounds to me like this Supplementary Finance Scheme             ~as&#13;

So there muat have been other ele.enta beaide the UNCTAD propoaala                    ingredienta advocated by the Fund were good for growth, but when the&#13;

&#13;
development program, always started out, aa I said before, with a                     projects.   The governaent often placed a much higher priority on non-&#13;
&#13;
projection of export earninga.        Some favored five-year projections.             developmental expenditures and purpoaes than they did on development,&#13;
&#13;
Others, aa you know, favored even longer-run projectionâ&#128;¢ even if they                 even though they were poor developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
were juat indicative, It waa neceaaary to have aome planning fr ..ework,                    It waa that kind of experience that we had 1n mind. We were&#13;
&#13;
and the expert projection vas the basea for planning.          Hov accurate had       trying to help createÂ· a situation in which the emphasis would be on the&#13;
&#13;
tbeae projections been?     What bad actually happened in the experience              defense of development.   In fact, in aome academic articles that&#13;
&#13;
of countriea?     In fact, we â&#128;¢eaaured the variationâ&#128;¢ from these                      wrote at the tiae, I labelled the article&amp;, "ln Defense of&#13;

&#13;
be to be able to do the job.        We found out, aa you auggeat, that there          Supplementary Finance Propoaal.    l 1 ike to think it had a lot. of&#13;
&#13;
wasn't a aingle cause of export ahort-falla.          There were many cauaea.         intellectual influence aa it permeated the thinking of UNCTAD and all&#13;
&#13;
The commonality vaa that there      vii   a aignificant ahortfall     ~n   earningâ&#128;¢   the representative&amp; that came.    We had a number of conferences&#13;
&#13;
compared to what had been planned, and the shortfall could not be                     stretching over four OT five yeara in this field, and there were lively&#13;
&#13;
foraeen.    The fundâ&#128;¢ provided under the Supplementary Finance Scheme                 diacuaaiona at all of them.&#13;
&#13;
were to be uaed to finance an export shortfall of a aaterial nature if                     In the end the opposition within the World Bank staff came from&#13;
&#13;
it happened.                                                                          persona who said that the Scheme waa not compatible with project&#13;
&#13;
     Another aspect in this matter of whether Supplementary Finance waa               finance.    Indeed I tried-- it ia aomewhere in the files of the World&#13;

      At one point under McM ..ara, we were really within the graep of               lend 011 the baaia of a precise coat benefit analyais."&#13;
&#13;
the whole thing.    If the World Bank had given a areen light, we would                    He did not want to lend the support which George Woods vas&#13;
&#13;
have had a Supple-entary Finance Sche.e operated by the World Bank.             By   willing to give.     We had gotten very far because everyone knew that&#13;
&#13;
this time the Co.pensatory Finance Scheae had been increased, but it is              had the aupport of the President of the World Bank.           Woods strongly&#13;
&#13;
increasingly clear that the Coâ&#128;¢penaatory Finance Scheme waa no                       supported our efforts even though he did not put the Scheme to the&#13;
&#13;
substitute for SuppleMentary Finance.     Also, by the time McNamara came,           Board for ita for.al adoption.        He felt that the political issue should&#13;
&#13;
we were in a pretty favorable abloaphere for considering a larae                     not be debated, argued and resolved in the World Bank, that we ought to&#13;
&#13;
increaae in IDA.    Preaident Johnaon and then Preaident Nixon were                  give the political iaaue to UNCTAD.&#13;
&#13;
basically pretty friendly to development and development aaaistance,                           We aaked the Board formally to agree to the transmission of the&#13;

&#13;
poaition to get new thinga aareed to.     But Bob didn't like the                    quite a bit of atir and discussion, but the Board finally let us&#13;

I told you thia about my lunch with Bob on thia matter?                              UNCTAD.     It vas never   de~ided   by the Executive Board of the Bank.       It&#13;

&#13;
FRIEDMAN:    Bob McNamara.   It doe a illustrate the whole issue here of             they supported it.     The political deciaion vas taken in UNCTAD, and&#13;
&#13;
the economics of the Supplementary Finance Proposal. He &amp;poke along the              that'a where we met the opposition, weakly of the United States sud&#13;
&#13;
following 1 inea:    ''What you are talking about is balance-of-payment              strongly of the French.       The United States wasn't quite sure of its&#13;
&#13;
financing.    That'a what it ia.   You can call it all sorte of things,              poeition.    One of the arguments made at th-t time was:         Maybe it will&#13;
&#13;
but it's balance-of-payments financing; and it get&amp; its validity from                make it more difficult for IDA replenishment instead of easi .. r.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               15                                                                                             16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Obviously that vaa a position that so.eone could hold.         It vaan't my        country to have and, therefore, to be prepared to support supplementary&#13;
&#13;
poai t ion.                                                                        financing to offset lome sort of decrease in the correct level of&#13;
      ln the caae of the french, it waa .ore that they had always                  export earnings, doesn't the Bank put itself in a position of being a&#13;
&#13;
believed in international co.aodity       asre~nta.   They ursed that tbe way      really super international planner -- manager of fiscal policy, â&#128;¢anager&#13;

developing countriea to support the ache.e.         They finally did, but they     FRIEDMAN:      There's a lot in vhat you are saying.             Remember, however,&#13;
&#13;
were the laet onea to coâ&#128;¢e around in aiving aupport.                               the Monetary Fund ia doing this already             fr~    the monetary viewpoint.&#13;
&#13;
      Again, I think, partly it val the ti.ea.        Tbe long conaidered          OLIVER:     But not in that much detail.&#13;

international Cocoa Agree.ent waa being diacuaaed, but it never came               FRIEDMAN:      The Monetary Fund ia implementing it's policy:                   let's call&#13;
&#13;
into eKiatence.      The French were conaittent in their aupport of                it "Conditionality."        For your purposes, 1 vould be glad to elaborate,&#13;

&#13;
not followins their lead.        Therefore other devicea vere attractive to        They are involved in judgements about the adequacy of macro-economic&#13;
&#13;
the other African couatriea.        They were the laat to come on aboard.     By   policy for balance-of-pay.eota          ~oage.ent     of developing countries They&#13;
&#13;
the time 1968 rGlled around, the developing countries were all on board            consider whether central banking policy ia adequate, fiscal policy is&#13;

with very few eKceptions.                                                          adequate, wage policy ia adequate, internal pricing policy is adequate;&#13;

OLIV&amp;R:       What was the year when the atudy done within the World Bank          the Fund already ia involved in these different aspects of                      econo~ic&#13;

decide what level of export earnings iâ&#128;¢ correct for a given developing             problem of uncertainty.         It is not possible to know what expurl&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             17                                                                            18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
earning&amp; are going to be, but a planner ia caught with the need to make        the decision making procesa of the Bank -- whether it vas a request for&#13;
&#13;
a judgement.     A developaent planner baa to put in aoae export earning       IDA funds, or lending operations or technical assistance.        I think&#13;
&#13;
projections.     Ibia ia done already.   Tbe difference under the Scheme       that, by the time McNamara became President, this work had really been&#13;
&#13;
would be that thia projection would be reviewed by the international           quite well advanced.   We had a good staff.    Obviously, there waa always&#13;
&#13;
community.                                                                     room for improvement, but it vas well beyond the initial stages when&#13;
&#13;
     I had gone through a aimilar experience with the Monetary Fund.           tbia still vas very controversial within the Bank itself as to the&#13;
&#13;
It vaan't just the Monetary Fund ataff that focuaaed on ita progr . . a        appropriatenesa of the Bank's doing this.&#13;
&#13;
under Article VIII and Article XIV.      It waâ&#128;¢ tbe experta of the                  I think the one thing that I felt at the time that I had not been&#13;
&#13;
countries that ca.e up with their judge.enta.      Tbe experts would have      succesaful in vas in persuading Mr. Wooda and the other people in the&#13;
&#13;
an interest in having a job well done.      All the expert&amp; would be           Bank that ve wanted to do more long-term basic research.     I found&#13;
&#13;
focuaaing on the export projection&amp;. They would in the end aay that            receptivity to the idea that ve could provide financial support in the&#13;
&#13;
they thought it ia reaaonable to uae an export projection aa a basis           academic world, and ve began to do that.      Andy Kamarck was the one who&#13;
&#13;
for getting aa1iatance.     What you would agree to waa not that tbia          vent around and made himaelf available to people in the academic world&#13;
&#13;
projection vaa neceaaarily correct, but that it vas a projection that          for some kind of financial support.&#13;
&#13;
could be included in a developaent program vortby of international                  When it came to actually recruiting a permanent long-term research&#13;
&#13;
support in caae. that   projection~       prove to be a correct one.    That   staff, which 1 bad tried to promote with Guy Orcutt,     1 found that I&#13;
&#13;
vaa the way ve tried to think it through.                                      got resistance everywhere in the Bank and no strong aupport from the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER;     Before ve go on to a diacuaaion of IDA, which ia the next          President. Because be supported me somewhat, ve bad the beginnings of&#13;
&#13;
logical queetion I think, let me aak in paaaing what you think of the          such a program.   We bad the beginnings with half-a-dozen people.          This&#13;
&#13;
econoaics work that vaa done in the Bank when you were the The Economic        vas when the economics staff is probably more like 80 or 100 people.&#13;
&#13;
Advieor to the President in contraat to from the economic&amp; work that           could not make an offer to Guy Orcutt, as I wanted to, to have a&#13;
&#13;
vas done later under Hr. McNamara.                                             per-anent position on the World Bank staff, because I felt 1 just&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Our main function wae to bring a concern for macro-economic      didn't have a job to offer him that vas really competitive to what he&#13;
&#13;
analyaia at the country level and general problema like com.odities,           had at Yale.   So he stayed in kind of a consulting position.&#13;
&#13;
supplementary finance, and external debt and to integrate it all into               I think that by the time 1970, 1971, '72 rolled around, the World&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                19                                                                                  20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a.nk waa ready for a major role in tbe field of long-tera academic-type          tbat it will have tbe expected practical applications.           When ~e decided&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 to do our three-layered model of the oil industry in Mexico, we            ~ere&#13;
&#13;
waa beginning really to feel the aqueexe of accelerating inflation and           hopeful that some day it would be uaeful.          We weren't sure, however,&#13;
&#13;
the difficultiea of raiaing funda for long-tera reaearch.         They were      that it would be uaeful in the Bank.        What   ~e   were sure of was that it&#13;
&#13;
welco-ing the role of the World Baok in thia.         lt waa very logical that   would give development economists a richer insight into the development&#13;
&#13;
the next phase of develop.ent in econu.ic work waa very largely of a             proceaa.&#13;
&#13;
reaearch nature.       Tbe problemâ&#128;¢ of the developing countriee ere ao acute           Much of the long tena research in the Bank of the kind that we&#13;
&#13;
theae daya that it ian't at all aurpriaing that tbe econo.ic ataff of            have just been talking about is really a kind of a vote of confidence&#13;
 ~&#13;
the World Bank ia again working on the problemâ&#128;¢ of individual                    that, if you do more long-term reaearch, the World Baok, aa an&#13;
&#13;
countries.                                                                       operating inatitution, will eventually find it uaeful; or at least the&#13;
&#13;
     1 could hope that the long-tera research would be aupported. I              developing world will find the product uaeful for an understanding of&#13;
&#13;
think that probably one of the heritageâ&#128;¢ of the laat 10 yearâ&#128;¢ ia                 the development process.         This ia the kind of a vote of confidence 1n&#13;
&#13;
bringing the academic approach .ore into the regular work of the World           long-term which is not always easy to get.&#13;
&#13;
Bank. I would think the country work of the World lank today ia better           OLIVER!    You think it   ~ade   senae for there to be a division of&#13;
&#13;
than when I waa there.         It hal melded the impact of more people   ~ho     econo.ilta, aome being in an Economicâ&#128;¢ Department          ~ ~     and special&#13;
&#13;
think in acadeajc ter.1.         Applying it to country work produces a better   econo.ic groupl, and others being country economists in the various&#13;
&#13;
product.                                                                         area or, the Projecta Department?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     When you uâ&#128;¢e terma like academic work or long-range                  FRIEDMAN: I felt at the time that the economtc staff ought to be one&#13;
&#13;
reaearch,     are you talking about work tbat baa little operational             staff vitb different aasignmenta.        An econo.iat might find himself&#13;
&#13;
significance aa far aa the Bank ia concerned?                                    aaaigned to a geographical function, like a country, or to a function&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Not   JUJJJ&amp;   operational â&#128;¢ignificance, but where the need for    like debt or long-term, projection analyais, or research.               wasn't&#13;
&#13;
the re1earch for current operational purposes ia not aa obvioua.          The    eâ&#128;¢ger to hâ&#128;¢ve a separate research ataff.           l wanted people from the&#13;
&#13;
work of the Bank could be done without it, so to apeak, and the                  economics ataff who would do long-term research, but, after that, would&#13;
&#13;
usefulness of the work ia more problematic.         It ia hard to be that sure   come back and do something elae.        I felt at the time      that this even&#13;
&#13;
after having spent one, two or three years in investigating something            applied to project economists.          didn't accept the idea that      the~e   was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              21                                                                               22&#13;

&#13;
something separate called "Project l!conoaica."      Aa far aa l could aee,     Yea.     Iaauea of cooperation didn't divide along thoae linea.        There&#13;
&#13;
it waa a atraight-forward application of .. ttera atudied by an                 were alwaya au.e economiate everywhere who were skeptical about thia&#13;
&#13;
econoaiat, ezcept that it waa being applied to inveatment analyaia              eKpanded economic work in the lank:     people like Hugh Collier and To.-y&#13;
&#13;
on the aicro level.       I waa in favor of one ataff with co.-on               Thomp1on and Ben ling, all able people.        We got along well and&#13;
&#13;
profeaaional atandarda, the individual aa1iga.enta being quite                  reapected each other, but they thought that it waa wrong of the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
different through the Bank.                                                     be that auch concerned with macro-economic analysis and to evaluate&#13;

&#13;
countriea.     It bec ..e partly .y job.   If I or Andy didn't agree       if   the idea of doing a study on commodities.       The idea that some&#13;
&#13;
we found fault with the econoaic analy1ia that waa going up to the              economiats did studies waa fine, but the idea that in-depth analysis&#13;
&#13;
Board       it waa our job to intercept it before it got further and to         waa done in order to get better loan decisions was for them seemingly&#13;
&#13;
bring it into the l!coaaaica Ca.aittee or in 1oae other way to review           difficult.     Often they juat didn't agree.    When these people cam.e to&#13;

&#13;
cooperation from the Area or Project Depart.ent economiete aa you did                   Hy problem waa really not with the area economists.     It was the&#13;

from the economiata in the Economic&amp; Depertment7                                area department heads who didn't give the atatua to the econ001iats that&#13;

FRIEDMAN:     I would aay nearly always. Yea.    The answer ie basically,       I wanted.     1 wanted the economists to have a much more formal -- I may&#13;

continue under your aucceaaor?                                                    that he bad been asked by Secretary Fowler to do this because of&#13;
PRIBDHAN:     No. McN.aara aboliahed the Bconomic Committee.                      Fowler'a preoccupation with the Viet Nam War and the budget and other&#13;
OLIVER:     Did he give any reaaon for thia?                                      financial proble.a.&#13;
F&amp;IBDMAN:     I   don't remember.                                                 OLIVER:     May I juat interrupt to say that I have been told that the IDA&#13;
&#13;
OLIVB&amp;:     Well, I think it ia time to turn our attention to IDA                 financing really originated as an idea in the Senate with Hike Monroney&#13;
&#13;
financing.        It ia now apparent to me that when you were aaked what          being a leading proponent of it, and that it was in turn related to a&#13;
&#13;
ahould be the volu.e of IDA financing, you were concerned not only with           deaire to find ways of financing larger American exports; so that&#13;
&#13;
the question of abaorptive capacity, in â&#128;¢ traditional project lending             inatead of ita being a vehicle for financing development, it was a&#13;
&#13;
sense, but alao in the aupple-ental financing aenae, 1o that the total            vehicle for something else.     lt changed, therefore, over the years with&#13;
&#13;
aaount of eiternal financing that you were likely to have 1uppoaed                the rolea reveraed:     Congress eventually dragging ita feet, and some of&#13;
&#13;
necealary would have been larger than otherwiae.         Would you introduce      the people in the Bank wanting to expend lOA. Can you straighten this&#13;
&#13;
tbia general apbject of the relation between what you have been telling           out?&#13;
&#13;
me and IDA financing?                                                             FRIEDMAN:     1 think this ia faacinating,   in a way, because if nothing&#13;
&#13;
PRIBDMAN:     In    te~a   of what actually happened and why, I think it ia       else it illustrates the proble. of the historians.       As it happened, by&#13;
&#13;
fair to say that it waan't neceaaarily all that integrated. On the IDA            sheer coincidence, one of wy very best friends in Washington at that&#13;
&#13;
repleniabaent, the firat question ia (please atop me if I aâ&#128;¢ repeating            t~e    was the AA to Senator Monroney who drafted the IDA legislation.&#13;
&#13;
myself)     -- How did Woods get into the IDA replenishment in the first          Indeed, when we first became very good friends, I did not know this.&#13;
&#13;
place?    Perhapa you feel well docu.ented on this.       I don't know.    Each   We becaâ&#128;¢e friends for completely different reasons. It had nothing to&#13;
&#13;
one will have a different perception.           will just give you my             do with our profession.     Tom Finney was a lawyer by profession who vas&#13;
&#13;
perception.                                                                       an Administrative Assistant to Monroney.      Konroney had gotten interested&#13;
&#13;
     When Woods wae firat asked to do the IDA replenishment, I had                in IDA and remsined interested.      You might go through the     p~r~onal&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                25                                                                                    26&#13;

papera of To- Finney for a little footnote oo thia.                                 figure.     l vaan't conatrained by Wooda.     Woods aaked, ''Whst would you&#13;
&#13;
      I re.ember Toa telling at the tiae tbat they thought of IDA aa a              come out with?"    And I finally caâ&#128;¢e out with the figure of $1 bill ion.&#13;
&#13;
technique to uae our local-currency      â&#128;¢~quiaitiona.   They vere i.preased             I    think we've talked before about how I got to this figure -- part&#13;
&#13;
vith our huge holdingâ&#128;¢ of      lo~al ~urren~iea.   Monroney aaked why it            of it vaa juat rationalization, part of it vaa trying to make the case&#13;
&#13;
couldn't be given to Gene Black.       "Gene vill do ao.etbing uaeful vitb          for a larger IDA, which, even at a billion dollars, wasn't going to be&#13;
thia .oney.     lt'a aoney that doean't coat ua anything.       We can give it      all that big in ter.a of the needs of developing countries.            It would&#13;

.way in a generoua vay.       We can help tbeae poor countriea."      That vaa      still keep the World Bank and IDA combined a small fraction of the&#13;
what Tom Finney told ae.       My iaprea1ion val that it bad nothing to do          developing finance of the world. IDA and the World Bank are now auch&#13;

OLlVEI:     I think it vaa three.                                                   balance-of- payaenta deficit.        At that time, the Treasury vas concerned&#13;

makes more aenae in teras of tiaina, doean't itf         By 1964, ve vere           balance-of-pâ&#128;¢ymenta deficit. I tried to find an anawer that would not&#13;
&#13;
already beginning to worry about the Deit replenishment of IDA.                     increase the balance-of-payments deficit.          wrote a paper to this end&#13;
&#13;
Whatever the replenishment perioda, IDA was small.          Woods had the           which I aent to the treasury and discussed with people like Secretary&#13;
&#13;
philoaophy that he wanted 1DA to be bigger than the World Bank.               vas   Fowler.    (I forget   e~actly   who was Undersecretary of the l'reaaury at&#13;

&#13;
balance-of-payaents point of view we could de.on1trate that IDA funds                  the view of the Treasury (fowler) that George Wooda should do it.               The&#13;

It val because we couldn't get any other statistics.          For    ex~ple,    for   time.&#13;

cooperation of the co.mercial baok1.       The creditor countriea were                bi-paased the various country Executive Directors?     If I understood you&#13;
not in the mood to coâ&#128;¢pel the cooperation of the banking community,                   correctly, you and Knapp and Aldervereld were dealing directly with&#13;

I don't think we aav that aa part of the IDA,       It vas     often part of          Even common Executive Directors (to the Bank of the Fund] -- the U.K.&#13;

&#13;
little bit, but I do want to make eure I underatand what you are aaying        attention.     Tbia ie the time when IDA itself was alao becoming more and-&#13;
&#13;
here.     I've been told that the nuaber of aeetinga between the President     ~re   a â&#128;¢atter of attention.    Kore IDA loanâ&#128;¢ were coming through&#13;
&#13;
and the Executive Director&amp; increased aubatantially in '66 and '67 over        conaortia.     There were more conaultative groupe.   So there were many&#13;
&#13;
earlier.     My question ia Waa thia increaae related in any way to the        more thinga to come to the Board.&#13;
&#13;
IDA replenishment iaaue? or Did it bave to do with other i11uea?                     Wooda wanted to have good relations with hia Board.        He was in&#13;
&#13;
fRIEDMAN:     Oh well, do you aean, informal â&#128;¢eetioga?   One on one?           favor of good relations with hie Board.     He was in favor of good&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     No, no, 1 aean Board â&#128;¢eetinga.                                     relations with the U. S. Treasury, Congress, and other governments&#13;
&#13;
fRIEDMAN:     Well, a few thingâ&#128;¢ were going on at the same tiae.      One ia   Woods waa not indifferent to the vieva of his Executive Director&amp;, but&#13;
&#13;
that the volume of lending waa going up.      There were more matterâ&#128;¢ that     I know, by fund etsndards, we didn't spend auch time on this.         It&#13;
&#13;
needed Board    de~iaiona.   There vae never any question that any loan        waan't a aajor effort.     In the fund you often didn't go to see the&#13;
&#13;
needed a Board deciaion.      The Board also was nov beginning to be given     Managing Director until you had diacusaione with the Executive&#13;
&#13;
not only a recommendation on a loan proposal but alao the etaff view           Directorâ&#128;¢ concerned.     Then you briefed the Managing Director on what&#13;
&#13;
about the economic condition&amp; of the country.      Theee diacuaaions           the Executive Director&amp; thought.     I never had the impression in the&#13;
&#13;
increaaed the Board work.                                                      Bank that the staff had that view of the role of Executive Directors.&#13;
&#13;
        The Board alao vas interested in general aubjects like the lending     On the other bend, they didn't ignore the..     They were consulted, so it&#13;
&#13;
rate of the Bank? This waB the time when the Bank's traditional lending        vas â&#128;¢ matter of the perceived relative importance of the Executive&#13;
&#13;
rate formula caâ&#128;¢e under question aa interest rates were beginning to           Bo&amp;fd.       would not say that the staff didn't think that the Board waa&#13;
&#13;
riae.     Even though they look low now, they were ri&amp;ing -- going from        importent or that the Board vas ignored.&#13;
&#13;
four to five to six percent.      Those were significant orders of                   But Woods was already known as being quite candid, of being s&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                 36&#13;

person who expressed frank vieva about things.           I beard later, I waa      Governor's Conference in Brazil walking into his office; it was the&#13;
&#13;
not that 111ucb Â·aware of it at the tiae, that be wu irritating people on          cloae1t I ever â&#128;¢av George Woods to crying.     He looked completely busted&#13;
the Board. I was privy to very close relations vitb the Executive                  up with bia bead dovn, looking at this article.      His   c~ent     to me was&#13;

the Canadian Executive Directors.         I didn't get that feeling fro. theâ&#128;¢.     re.arka to refer to the ataff, not to the Board.        The ataff wasn't&#13;

Maybe, it was becauae 1 waa known aa being particularly friendly with              acared of Woods.     By tbia time, they had discovered that Woods was a&#13;

Wooda.    Aa a aatter of   fa~t.   I vaa not a frequent viaitor at hia home        softy.    He didn't burt people.   Woods was not a man that his staff&#13;

or anything like that.      We were not    so~ially   friendly.    If there vas    feared.     There was more caution in making hostile remarks when I first&#13;
&#13;
hostility between Woodâ&#128;¢ and aa.e of bia Board          â&#128;¢~ber1,    it wasn't        came.     By '67, eome 8taff were openingly critical.      1 was bearing Such&#13;

&#13;
at the time.     I didn't go and aak an Executive Director if he waa               Woods.     In the Fund we didn't talk as they did in the Bank.&#13;
upaet or not by what George Wood1 had aaid. I did, however, apeak to               OLlV!R:     I haven't read the article, but   a~   told that it did make&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors quite frequently, becauae I had tbia habit from the            some comments about Executive Directors.      So my question is "Did Staff&#13;

FRIEDMAN:     You ought to read it: particularly someone who ia trying to          mostly with individual memberâ&#128;¢ of the staff.       Sometimes a number of us&#13;

&#13;
ea1ily verifiable one way or another.        AI be aav it, there waa no            recollect it, the Bank got      pe~isaion   quickly. The concern about the&#13;
&#13;
particular need for the World Bank to go further into the U. S. Capital            balance-of-payments increased during discussions about IDA.        The&#13;

source&amp;, especially Switzerland.        There waa no aenae of urgency about        But Woods' view was, to my recollection, very clear:        he wanted to&#13;

        Wooda bid a different view.     TWo tbinga he puabed bard.     Moat of          He also wanted to borrow from other markets, but in the case of&#13;
&#13;
all, he wanted to go back into the U. S. capital â&#128;¢arket.            He felt that   the French â&#128;¢arket, be felt that the pricing that vas being propoaed by&#13;
&#13;
the Bank bad been away too long.        He 1rgued that it didn't â&#128;¢atter that       the French Government was too costly.        The French had a variety of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank did not need the money.        What .. ttered vaa to have market          fees, and they added up to a pricing that was not attractive.           So be&#13;

&#13;
      With Woods' per.iasion, I approached the head of the Saudi Arabian              for â&#128;¢e to say whether it va&amp; more or leas than under Black.           I could be&#13;

"econoaic" that, if it waa good econoaica, aoaeone in the private               I waa in the World Bank waa the relation between the IFC and the World&#13;
eector would be willing to do it.    The World Bank did not have to uae         Bank.     1   kind of hope that one of the things that will come out of your&#13;

&#13;
         The other thin&amp; that he atreeaed vaa that the Bank should not          talked about the IFC -- at least at the President's Council.                   The only&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             43                                                                                   44&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
thiag I recall diacuaaiag regardiua lFC waa the aeaeral queatioa of             autona.oua agency and, indeed, who            ~   the head of an autonomoua agency&#13;
&#13;
whether the World lank ahould be willina to help ezpand the IFC by              in everything ezcept        fo~l      rank.   So I think hie non attendance at the&#13;
&#13;
. . kina a aubatantial loan to the IFCf      Vooda waa very auch in favor of    Preaident'a Council .eetinga would have to be carefully interpreted.&#13;
&#13;
leodiua â&#128;¢ouey to IFC,      He waa very proud -- I would aee thia iu hia         It did not neceaaarily .. an that Wooda wanted to eKclude          h~.    It   co~ld&#13;
&#13;
talka with officiala abroad -- of the fact that the World lank had a            eaaily have been that Marty was not intereated in becoming another one&#13;
&#13;
"private an-" which waa called the lfC. He would couatantly refer to            of tbe vice preaidente of tbe World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
the fact that the Bank had a private arâ&#128;¢, the lfC. lut I don't know             OLIVEI:     Do you know why he wae not in fact made Pre1ident of IFC?&#13;
&#13;
what that â&#128;¢eaut io laok-IFM relationa.                                          FRIEDMAN:         No. I don't know.     There has been get a lot of gossip about&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Did be invite the Vice Preaident of IFC, Marty Roaeo, to ait        thia.     But again, it wae iotereating in my relationa with Woods that l&#13;
&#13;
with the Preaident'a council?                                                   found that he rarely gossiped.            He gol&amp;iped practically nothing at all&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     lot aa a regular thing.                                           to .y knowledge about Marty Rosen.            When be goaaiped, it was about his&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Only when aa.e queation related to IFC waa being diacueaed?         frienda in New York.         He did not talk much about personal relations.&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     I gather when Karty ht.eelf evidenced an intereat in it.     My   interpreted it at the tiâ&#128;¢e that he didn't have many peraonel friends.&#13;
&#13;
iâ&#128;¢preaaion then, aa aoaeone who had known Marty Roaen for aome tiâ&#128;¢e,            The people in the Bank were not in hia social circle; he didn't have&#13;
&#13;
waa that Marty hi.aelf wae eager to keep independent of the World Bank.         ~cb     to aay about theae people perbapa because he didn't know much&#13;
&#13;
He waan't    puah~na   ht..elf into the Preaident Council.   He reaarded        about    tbe~~.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
hU.aelf â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ in a way, â&#128;¢ore autona.oua, in a way, probably true, auperior         OLIVER:     Well, it'a probable that he maiotained a fair number of social&#13;
&#13;
in rank.                                                                        relations with hia frienda in New York.&#13;
&#13;
        At thie point, there ia no Senior Vice Preeident in the World           FRIEDHAN:         Tbat'a right.   To illustrate my point, 1 think Ceorge Woods&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     There were juat a half of doaeo of ua who were vice preaidente,       waa over at my houee once io four yeara.&#13;
&#13;
while loaen had a title of Executive Vice Preaident with â&#128;¢any apecial           OLIVIR:     Did he ever comment to you about how he felt about Washington&#13;
&#13;
perka.     He waa telling people, aa far al I could see without                 aâ&#128;¢ an area relative to New York as an area?&#13;
&#13;
refutation, that be bad been told by Eugene Black that be would become          FRI~DMAI:         That came out, I would aay, repeatedly.     He clearly did not&#13;
&#13;
Preaident of IFC and that he expected Mr. Woods to â&#128;¢ake him President.          admire the Washington environment.            It was too political for him.&#13;
&#13;
Marty Rosen acted like a person who wanted to be the head of an                 People seeaed to be -- at least so he said -- they seemed to be much&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 45                                                                               46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
aore concerned about their peraonal preati&amp;eâ&#128;¢ getting credit for                   reaaon why be waa relatively aucceaaful in getting the cooperation of&#13;
&#13;
thioga, feelin&amp; insecure about the future.                                         Congreaa for varioua tbinga the Bank wanted to do.         Were there people&#13;
       There were obviously a number of people in Washington like Senator          beaidea SeQ8tor Fulbright that were mentioaed aa people George Wooda&#13;
Fulbriaht, whom be liked very much.         I tbiak be liked Joe Fowler.     l'â&#128;¢   waa able to call upon, ao to apeak, for help?&#13;
aure there were otbera that I didn#t particularly        kno~.   Be would talk     FaiBDKAH:   Seoator aobertaoo waa hired by hiâ&#128;¢â&#128;¢         1 don't think Wooda can&#13;
&#13;
about how he bad bad dinoer with thea.         Aa far aa I waa concerned,          be coapared with Eugene Black in teraa of uaing aocial attributeâ&#128;¢ on&#13;
                                                                             He    behaLf of the Bank.     For eza.ple, with Fulbright, Woods was clearly&#13;
&#13;

the Monetary Fund and the World Bank for France. even tbou&amp;h actually              didn't take over bia aocial role.     I didn't invite Fulbright ovet to&#13;
&#13;
Larre waa one of the ooea who vaa opposin&amp; SuppleMentary finance and               the bouae for dinner.     But I felt that Woods wsan't very much of a&#13;
&#13;
the IDA repleniab.ent.                                                             aocializer. I bad luoch with hiâ&#128;¢ very often.       It would just be the two&#13;

       Bia view of New York waa tbat there were â&#128;¢any .are people there             of us.    J think he kind of enjoyed thia:     aitting down and having luoch&#13;
&#13;
who knew about finance, . . ny aore people who ae..ed to be aelf                   and chatting about thinga.     1 forget what they were, but they tended to&#13;

            In March 1974, July and December 1985,
            June 1986, and February 1988, Irving S. Friedman was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver and Charles Ziegler.
            During his tenure at the Bank from 1964 to 1974, Mr.
            Friedman worked as an economic advisor to the president of
            the World Bank (1964-1970); as chairman of the economic
            committee (1964-1970); and at the Economic Development
            Institute (EDI) as professor in residence (1971-1974). His
            transcripts exist as a seven volume set, consisting of one
            session in 1974 and eight sessions from 1985 to 1988. His
            transcript concerns his tenure at the Bank after working for
            the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He was appointed by
            George Woods as his economic advisor. He discusses in detail
            the relationship of the IMF and the World Bank and
            propagating that development. .
