Amendment to the Administration Agreement between the Ministry of&#13;
Finance of Russian Federation and the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development and the International Development&#13;
Association concerning the Rapid Social Response Trust Fund&#13;
(TFO 71370)&#13;
Dear Mr. Storchak:&#13;
1.    We refer to the Administration Agreement between Ministry of Finance of&#13;
Russian Federation (the "Donor") and the International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA),&#13;
(collectively, the "Bank") regarding the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for the Rapid Social&#13;
Response (TFO71370) (the "Trust Fund") effective October 3, 2009 (the "Administration&#13;
Agreement").&#13;
2.     Pursuant to recent discussions between the Bank and the Donors, the Bank&#13;
proposes to amend paragraph 3.2 of the Annex 2 to the Administration Agreement to read&#13;
as follows.&#13;
"3.2. In addition, costs for program management and supervision as&#13;
defined in Annex I up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of each&#13;
Contribution will be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis. If the&#13;
contributions increase beyond what was originally expected at the time of&#13;
counter-signature of the first administration agreement, and the&#13;
administrative costs increase as a result, the Donors acknowledge that an&#13;
additional administrative fee may be applied to such new contributions."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-2-&#13;
3.    In addition, the Bank proposes to amend paragraph 8.2 of the Administration&#13;
Agreement to extend the Disbursement Deadline to June 30, 2018 to read as follows:&#13;
Paragraph 8.2:&#13;
"8.2. It is expected that the Contributions will be fully disbursed by the&#13;
Bank by June 30, 2018. The Bank shall only disburse Contributions for&#13;
the purposes of this Agreement after such date with the written approval of&#13;
the Donors."&#13;
4.    All other terms of the Administration Agreement will remain the same.&#13;
5.    The Bank will disclose this Amendment and related information on this Trust&#13;
Fund in accordance with the World Bank Policy on Access to Information. By entering&#13;
into this Amendment, the Donor consents to disclosure of this Amendment and related&#13;
information on this Trust Fund.&#13;
6.    We propose that this letter will constitute an amendment to the Administration&#13;
Agreement between the Bank and the Donor. Please confirm your acceptance to the&#13;
foregoing, on behalf of the Donor, by signing and dating the two originals, retaining one&#13;
original for your records and returning the other original to the Bank. Upon receipt by the&#13;
Bank of a copy of all of the respective amendments to the Administration&#13;
Agreements/Agreements with the Bank signed by each Donor currently contributing to&#13;
the Trust Fund, this amendment will become effective as of the date that the last of such&#13;
Donors countersigns its respective amendment (the "Effective Date").&#13;
Sincerely,&#13;
