HOUSEHOLD INCOME OR HOUSEHOLD INCOME PER CAPITA&#13;
IN WELFARE COMPARISONS&#13;
March 1980&#13;
In studies of income distribution, household income is the common measure of&#13;
household welfare, although household per capita income is better since it auto-&#13;
matically "corrects" for household size. Perhaps the continued use of the former&#13;
is a consequence of the belief that in practice the two give very similar results.&#13;
This paper shows that in many cases those results differ substantially. Policy&#13;
prescription based on household income rather than household per capita income&#13;
can be very defective. The paper compares results according to the two income&#13;
concepts for Malaysian data. US data are then used in a comparison over time.&#13;
The disparity between the two Malaysian distributions is illustrated by their&#13;
cross tabulation. A quarter of the households in the lowest forty percent of&#13;
the household income distribution is in the upper three quintiles of household&#13;
per capita income; and 10 percent of the same lowest forty are in the highest&#13;
two quintiles of the second distribution. The paper also shows that the distribu-&#13;
tion of benefits from public education--measured as the public costs of school years--&#13;
is very inegalitarian if household income is used. The reverse occurs if household&#13;
per capita income is used. Similar reversals occur in comparisons involving parti-&#13;
tions by occupation and sex of head of household. Women headed households, for&#13;
example, have sub-mean household incomes but their household income per capita&#13;
equals the mean. The paper also examines the differences in the age-income pro-&#13;
files of the two distributions. It then considers whether the much discussed&#13;
secular stagnation in US measures of inequality is changed if household income per&#13;
capita is used rather than the usual household income measure. Use of the per&#13;
capita concept results in a slight decrease in US inequality between 1947 and 1972.&#13;
Appendix 3 explores how long term growth in per capita incomes and the associated&#13;
changes in the size composition of households may affect measurement of&#13;
inequality.&#13;

Progress against poverty over time is underestimated ..... An old&#13;
person who is able to afford to maintain a separate household by virtue of&#13;
higher social security payments is better off than he would be in their&#13;
absence -- but he is counted as worse off because he is a separate house-&#13;
hold with low income rather than part of his children's household.l/&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
Interest in the distribution of income derives from the fundamental&#13;
interest in the distribution of human welfare. Welfare cannot be measured but&#13;
we can measure income, which is generally regarded as the best proxy for wel-&#13;
fare. Consequently size distributions of income are the focus of a great deal&#13;
of analytical work.&#13;
Most of such work is based on household income, although household&#13;
per capita income is a better measure. (The distribution of household per&#13;
capita income can be interpreted as the per capita income of households or as&#13;
the distribution of household per capita income by individuals.) This was&#13;
shown by Simon Kuznets (1976) when he traced through the differences in the&#13;
two concepts in great detail and concluded (p. 87):&#13;
It makes little sense to talk about inequality in the distribution of&#13;
income among families or household by income per family or household when&#13;
the underlying units differ so much in size ..... before any analysis can be&#13;
undertaken, size distributions of families or households by income per&#13;
family or household must be converted to distributions of persons (or&#13;
consumer equivalents) by size of family or household income per person (or&#13;
per consumer).&#13;
Notwithstanding the work of Kuznets, apparently the lack of interest&#13;
in household per capita income and the widespread persistence in the use of&#13;
1/ Irwin Garfinkel from the foreward of Reynolds and Smolensky (1977), p. xxi.&#13;
See also Rivlin (1975) pp. 1 and 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
household income to measure inequality are due to the belief that the difference&#13;
between household per capita income -- however defined -- and household income&#13;
is unimportant.-/  Analysts also use household income because no other income&#13;
data are available. Yet if there were widespread dissatisfaction with household&#13;
income as the basic measuring rod, in several years data generators such as&#13;
statistical offices would begin to supply data based on household per capita&#13;
income.&#13;
The continued widespread use of household income suggests that there&#13;
is need for the kind of exploratory analysis presented below which involves a&#13;
comparison of some of the difference in results from using the two concepts.&#13;
That analysis shows that the differencesbetween the two are very substantial.&#13;
It is misleading to use the one as a proxy for the other. Policy prescription&#13;
based on household income rather than household per capita income can be very&#13;
defective.&#13;
Although the argument is that household per caoita income (PCY) is&#13;
preferable to household income, it must not be inferred from this that the&#13;
former is an ideal concept of income. The ideal concept is much removed from&#13;
household PCY as hitherto measured in surveys. The ideal concept would&#13;
adequately deal with the consequences of government tax and expenditure&#13;
1/ Most recent work on US income inequality -- for example -- is based on&#13;
household income. See Paglin (1975), Comments on Paglin (1977), Reynolds&#13;
and Smolensky (1977), Browning (1979). Over 88 Dercent of recent studies&#13;
of income distribution in 60 developing countries were based on household&#13;
income or expenditure. See Shail Jain (1975).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
activity-- as well as the valuation of the non-market activity of household&#13;
members. Household PCY -- as well as household income -- could be so defined&#13;
as to include such changes. But current practice of statistical and survey&#13;
organizations is a long way from any such inclusion.&#13;
In comparing some of the differences resulting from the use of house-&#13;
hold income or household PCY, an aggregate measure of inequality is a useful&#13;
vehicle for exposition. We have chosen the Gini coefficient for this purpose&#13;
not because we believe that it is an ideal measure, but because its use is&#13;
widespread and previous    work   involving it provides useful material to&#13;
illustrate the basin analysis.-/&#13;
Part 2 of the paper uses Malaysian data to describe the imperfect&#13;
correlation between household income and household PCY.-/ Part 3 involves&#13;
1/ The usual income concept is "money income" before it is reduced by payment&#13;
of direct personal taxes and indirect taxes, but excluding direct corporate&#13;
taxes, retained profits, employer payment of social security taxes, and in-&#13;
cluding government transfers; in short a concept very close to personal in-&#13;
come, as defined in US national income accounting. This concept is inade-&#13;
quate. It does not measure total income as it would be before taxes are&#13;
paid or government transfer payments received. The concept implicitly&#13;
assumes that there are no benefits from government outlays, since no attempt&#13;
is made to treat any part of them (transfers excepted) as increasing incomes.&#13;
2/ The Gini coefficient suffers from numerous shortcomings, as do the other&#13;
summary measures of inequality. For example, the Gini coefficient is not&#13;
additively decomposible, into between groups and within groups Gini co-&#13;
efficients for grouped data. Moreover the rank orderings of distributions&#13;
by the various summary measures are not congruent. See Atkinson (1970).&#13;
3/ The comparison uses data from a Malaysian sample survey designed to provide&#13;
information on the distribution of benefits from public expenditures across&#13;
households. Household income was a basic reference variable and was carefully&#13;
estimated through the survey. The concept used was very close to personal&#13;
income as defined in the national accounts. Meerman (1979), Chapter 3.&#13;

comparison of incomes and educational and other benefits by groups in&#13;
Malaysia in terms of the two income concepts. Part 4 uses the Malaysian&#13;
data to compare the age-income profiles for the two distributions, to&#13;
some degree in welfare perspective. Part 5 carries out a comparative&#13;
measurement of the secular trend in US income inequality contrasting&#13;
the results for the two concepts. Appendix 1 shows how the US Gini&#13;
coefficients were calculated. Appendix 3 is an exploration of how long&#13;
term growth in per capita incomes and the associated changes in the size&#13;
composition of households may affect the value of Gini coefficients.&#13;
2. Contrast between Household and Household Per Capita Income&#13;
There is a strong relation between family incomes and their&#13;
size: Mean family size is usually an increasing function of family income.&#13;
But family size is a decreasing function of family PCY. As a consequence&#13;
of this systematic relationship there is substantial non-correlation&#13;
between size distributions using household incomes and household PCY.1/&#13;
In the sample survey of 1465 Malaysian households generated in 1974, the&#13;
Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient for the two distributions was&#13;
0.77.1-/ In Table 1 below, this point is made in detail by defining quin-&#13;
tiles of household per capita income and distributing the households in each&#13;
quintile across their corresponding quintiles of household income. The table&#13;
1/ Throughout the paper household PCY and family PCY are used interchangeably.&#13;
The concepts are very similar and refer to statistical practice in the USA&#13;
(family) and Malaysia (household).&#13;
2&#13;
2/ The R for the two was 0.66.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
dramatically illustrates the disparity in the two distributions. W4hat may be&#13;
called the diagonal of co-incidence has maximum values at the lowest and highest&#13;
quintiles of 62 and 66 percent, while all other values on the diagonal are only&#13;
in the 30's. Also revealing is the fact that the three lowest quintiles of&#13;
household income have some households in all five of the quintiles of household&#13;
PCY.-!/&#13;

hold'PCY.             .&#13;
1/   It is not possible to readily generate such a table for the US from&#13;
published data of the US Census Bureau. But it would be similar. For&#13;
example, in 1972 the lowest family income in the interval from $15,000&#13;
to $24,000 exceeded the overall mean ($12,625) by 19 percent. Yet the&#13;
family PCY of 27 percent of the families in the interval was less than&#13;
the overall family PCY. Richard Groeb's article in Duncan and Morgan (1976),&#13;
using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics of the University of&#13;
Michigan, also notes the non-congruence Qf the ranking of family incomes&#13;
with an adult equivalent measure. The RL obtained by him is very similar&#13;
to the Malaysian results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
In developing countries the re-ordering of families by family PCY&#13;
also frequently results in a size distribution with a substantially lower Gini&#13;
coefficient than the distribution obtained from the use of family income.&#13;
This has been recently confirmed by Pravin Visaria who calculated Gini coeffi-&#13;
cients for eleven family income or family expenditure distributions in five&#13;
countries (India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Malaysia). In each of the&#13;
eleven cases the Gini coefficient was lower for household per capita income&#13;
(expenditure) by individuals than for household income (expenditure).-     In&#13;
the Malaysian sample, however, the difference was not great. The Gini coeffi-&#13;
cient was 0.48 for household income and 0.46 for household PCY by individuals.&#13;
And in developed countries the pattern may be reversed.&#13;
Re-ordering the size distribution by family PCY has substantial&#13;
policy implications for anti-poverty programs. In the Malaysian data if the&#13;
"poverty group" is defined as the bottom quintile of households ranked by&#13;
household income, then -- as shown by Table 1 -- only 62 percent of the&#13;
"genuinely poor"(those in the lowest per capita income quintile) would be in-&#13;
cluded in this group. The remaining 38 percent of the poor would fall outside&#13;
the target group. Conversely a substantial percentage of households from&#13;
higher per capita income quintiles, would be included in the poverty group.-/&#13;
The thinking which leads to the conclusion that household income is&#13;
a poor measure of welfare can be extended to object to household PCY as well.&#13;
The latter fails to consider the effects of the age composition of the family&#13;
as well as economies of scale in the operation of households. The work on&#13;
equivalence scales deals with these difficulties by providing a technique for&#13;
1/ See Visaria, Pravin (1978).&#13;
2/ It is noteworthy that, in carrying out government programs to assist the&#13;
poor, an adult equivalent approach is usually used to ascertain who the&#13;
poor are. Family income is never used to define poverty for such programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
converting household members of different ages to adult equivalents.&#13;
Nevertheless,                    the distribution when using family PCY&#13;
probably will be very similar to the distribution when using family income&#13;
per adult equivalent.   For example the R  between household PCY and household&#13;
income per adult equivalent for the Malaysian survey data was .968.&#13;
3. Comparison of Incomes and of Government Benefits&#13;
The   discussion has proceeded in terms of disparity in the&#13;
aggregate size distributions. W4hat happens when comparisons are made for&#13;
various income partitions? Using the Malaysian sample we examined three&#13;
partitions (race, community size, and region) for two definitions of income&#13;
(household income and households by household PCY). For the three partitions&#13;
the rank ordering of the several means was identical for both distributions.&#13;
For example mean household incomes of the Chinese exceeded those of the Indians,&#13;
who in turn had higher mean incomes than the Malays. The same pattern carried&#13;
through when the measurement was in means of household PCY. Frequently, however,&#13;
the ratios of the means of the household income partition differed substantially&#13;
from the corresponding ratios of the household PCY partition. As indicated in&#13;
Table 2 below,in two additional partitions there were important differences&#13;
in the rank ordering of the means.&#13;
If the interest were poverty as it distributes by sex of head of&#13;
household, there would be concern with female headed households if household&#13;
income were used. But one would discover that many of the poor female headed&#13;

families were quite small, suggesting that it was not such a problem after all.&#13;
And in fact mean incomes by sex of household head are identical when measured in&#13;
household PCY. Again students could be classified as a poverty group since their&#13;
household incomes are but 63 percent of mean household incomes. Yet this would&#13;
be misleading since in terms of household PCY, their incomes are nearly one and&#13;
three quarters of the mean. Similarly, if the cut-off point for defining a group&#13;
as in poverty was average income for that group of less than half the mean, land-&#13;
less agricultural workers would be excluded if household income is the measure;&#13;
but they would be included if household PCY is used.&#13;
There are also discrepancies if the household distribution of benefits&#13;
from public expenditure is being measured. In the Malaysian sample, in-patient&#13;
days of hospital care were distributed in rather inegalitarian fashion when&#13;
matched to household incomes. The use of household PCY changed this outcome&#13;
to one in which there was little relation between income and consumption of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

in-patient care. There were also some startling intra-distributional changes:&#13;
The second lowest income quintile had the highest number of in-patient days&#13;
when the measure was in terms of household income. It dropped to the lowest&#13;
number when household PCY was used.&#13;
In Table 3 we have traced through the difference between the two&#13;
distributions for education. For each quintile, and at each level, the Table&#13;
presents mean number of students enrolled per household. Column one, for example,&#13;
gives the primary enrollments from lowest to highest quintile for household income.&#13;
It appears to be highly inegalitarian, in fact nearly monotonic positive with in-&#13;
come. The fourth column has the same partition for the secondary level. The&#13;
association between income and household enrollment is strongly positive. Enroll-&#13;
ment in the highest quintile is three times that of the lowest. In the sixth&#13;
column the partition for the post secondary shows that household enrollment at&#13;
the highest quintile is more than ten-fold that of the lowest quintile.&#13;

Average recurrent costs to the government of a student year in 1974&#13;
were as follows (Malaysian dollars):&#13;
primary            $ 238&#13;
secondary            299&#13;
post-secondary      3197&#13;
The total of these government costs per household -- as implied by the enroll-&#13;
ment data -- by income quintile are given in column (8). The conclusion:&#13;
Malaysia's educational system is inegalitarian. The richest fifth receives an&#13;
average subsidy over twice as large as the poorest.-/     If the process is&#13;
repeated using household PCY, a different picture evolves as indicated&#13;
in columns (2), (5), (7) and (9).      The conclusion then is that&#13;
primary education is highly egalitarian; secondary education is on&#13;
balance egalitarian; and post-secondary education is clearly pro-rich. Measured&#13;
in terms of costs, the overall impact clearly favors the lowest three quintiles,&#13;
and the lowest quintile most of all.&#13;
The   reason for this outcome is that household enrollment is&#13;
a function of the number of school-age children in the household. Children per house-&#13;
hold increases with household income but decreases with household PCY. Table 4&#13;
shows this for the elementary-school population. As explained earlier, house-&#13;
hold PCY is inherently a better measure of welfare than household income. Con-&#13;
sequently the egalitarian conclusion suggested by column (9) is more meaningful&#13;
than the opposite as suggested by column (8).&#13;
The results in Table 3 can be taken a further step which modifies&#13;
the conclusion that the educational system is pro-poor. Taking off on the&#13;
notion of each according to his needs, define distributive neutrality (or the&#13;
1/ However the subsidies as a percentage of household income range from 14.8%&#13;
in the lowest quintile to 13.3% in the second, 11.6% in the third, 8.8% in&#13;
the fourth and 3.8% in the highest quintile.&#13;

norm) as equal benefits per school-aged person by level. For example, a house-&#13;
hold with three school aged children should have three times the enrollment&#13;
(and public spending) as the household with only one school aged child. At the&#13;
primary level the mean enrollment ratio is 90% (column (3) in Table 3). If all&#13;
households had 90% of their primary aged children in school, there would be con-&#13;
siderable increase in enrollments in the lowest and second quintiles as shown&#13;
in column (3). In contrast, the fourth quintile is over-enrolled (99%) relative&#13;
to the norm. For each level we calculated the implicit financial shortfall or&#13;
1/&#13;
excess that is implied by over- and under-enrollment.      These were then summed&#13;
by quintile across the three levels. The totals which resulted are presented&#13;
in column (10) of Table 3. Again the outcome is somewhat pro-rich: The short-&#13;
fall steadily decreases from the lowest through the third quintile, becomes&#13;
an excess in the fourth quintile and increases to an excess of $88 per house-&#13;
hold in the highest quintile.&#13;

children of primary school age per household was 1.63. Since the normal&#13;
enrollment ratio was 90%, the mean enrollment per household would have&#13;
been 1.45. The actual enrollment was 1.37 and the per household discrepancy&#13;
was therefore (1.45-1.37)($238)=$19, in which $238 is the mean cost of a&#13;
primary school-year.&#13;

4. Income Inequality and the Life Cycle&#13;
In the analysis of the size distribution of income, the relation of&#13;
age of household head to income or to the life cycle of earnings has achieved&#13;
considerable prominence. Paglin (1975), for instance, defined equality in in-&#13;
come distribution as consisting of equal incomes for all families at the same&#13;
stage of their life cycle. In his view, normative equality is consistent with&#13;
different incomes for households with heads in different age classes. Such age&#13;
related income differences are held to be "functional" since they arise from&#13;
differences in productivity due to differences in length of work experience,&#13;
and to the life cycle pattern of investment and returns to that investment in&#13;
human capital.-/ Measures of income inequality should include only "non&#13;
functional" differences, that is differences not explained by differences in&#13;
age of head of household. Paglin's commentators (1977) had many problems with&#13;
this approach. As discussed below, the introduction of per capita incomes as&#13;
the empirical income measure creates additional problems with it.&#13;
The age-income profile for household incomes generally takes the form&#13;
of an inverted U, and is similar to the life-cycle pattern of earnings for the&#13;
individuals. Initially low, they increase with experience, peak and then fall&#13;
on retirement. The reason why the relation is more peaked for the household&#13;
than the individual may be because of wives and adolescents moving into out-&#13;
side employment as the family matures, and then retiring or moving out&#13;
in the final years of the cycle. This pattern is reflected in Table 5 and in&#13;
1/ Paglin's equality means equal incomes for households at the same stage in the&#13;
life cycle as measured by the age of the household head. His proxy for&#13;
equal incomes at the same stage in the life cycle is mean household income&#13;
for data grouped by age of family head.&#13;

Figure 1 which show relative household income by age of head of household for&#13;
the 1465 households of the Malaysian sample.&#13;
As also indicated in Figure 1, when we move to household PCY (by&#13;
household), the inverted U takes a more complicated form. The profile for&#13;
household PCY depends to a greater degree on the life-cycle in household size.&#13;
We can speculate that households with very young heads are single individuals&#13;
or childless couples in the labour force. These units would tend to have high&#13;
per capita incomes, even though individual earnings are low. Subsequently,&#13;
although the income of the head of household grows, the departure of women from&#13;
the labour force in their child-bearing years together with a growth in the&#13;
number of non-earning dependents leads to a decline in per capita incomes.&#13;
As family size stabilizes, and incomes continue to grow -- perhaps, due in part&#13;
to labour force entrance of secondary earner(s) -- this decline is reversed&#13;
and per capita incomes peak. Finally the effect of age on income and declin-&#13;
ing family size leads to a substantial decline in incomes (due to retirement)&#13;
and per capita incomes follow suit, although with a rise in the highest age&#13;
categories,&#13;
As a consequence of the life-cycle, in Malaysia at least, mean&#13;
households PCY of households whose heads are under their mid-thirties is above&#13;
average in contrast to the sub-mean magnitude for the corresponding household&#13;
income distribution. (See Figure 1.) After the mid-thirties, however, the&#13;
age-income profiles for the two distributions are similar: They both rise,&#13;
then peak in the later forties and finally fall. But the peak is considerably&#13;
higher for household income than for household PCY.&#13;
In developed countries such as the US, a similar ordering using in-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
comes after considering government effects,-/ may result in a flatter relation&#13;
between age and household PCY, because of the combined effects of progressive&#13;
taxes and pro-poor government transfers and other benefits. The fact that a&#13;
much larger share of household heads under the age of thirty are students in&#13;
the USA -- with low earnings the consequence -- would tend to reinforce this&#13;
conclusion. It is possible that the age income profile for US household PCY --&#13;
after considering the effects of government -- would be something close to a&#13;
more or less horizontal line or would show only a weak relation so that the&#13;
notion of adjusting the income distribution for age would be superfluous. Such&#13;
flatness in the age-income profile would in part be the result of household in-&#13;
comes -- after considering government budget effects -- and household size moving in&#13;
tandem over the life cycle; that is first increasing together, peaking and&#13;
then as the retirement years approach, contracting together. It would also&#13;
indicate the success of the welfare policy of the US federal government since&#13;
in effect one of its goals is the reduction of per head income disparity due to&#13;
variation in age and family size.&#13;
These results also suggest an additional reason for using household&#13;
PCY in measuring inequality. An important aspect of correction for the effects&#13;
of the life cycle in measuring inequality is the effect of the cycle on house-&#13;
hold size, and therefore on the per capita welfare within a household which is&#13;
generated by a given amount of income. Accordingly a measure which automatically&#13;
adjusts for size of household, by that same token, also eliminates part of the&#13;
1/ After payment of taxes and including transfers as well as benefits in kind.&#13;
This is clearly the best measure of income if household economic welfare is&#13;
the focus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
"error" in the measurement of welfare resulting from failure to consider the&#13;
effects of the life-cycle. Household PCY does precisely this. In other words&#13;
the adjustment of income by family size (or possibly by family size measured&#13;
in adult equivalents) may be better than an adjustment based on age if the&#13;
purpose of the exercise is to obtain an income distribution in which differ-&#13;
ences in incomes primarily reflect differences in welfare.&#13;
5. Application to Times Series&#13;
The re-ordering from family income to family PCY may also result in&#13;
Gini coefficients which are affected by alterations in average family size&#13;
over time. The importance of such trends are apparent on examining US data.&#13;
Table 6 illustrates the considerable change in average US family size by&#13;
tabulating the percentage of families in each size class for the two years&#13;
1972 and 1947.-/ (In the table "unrelated individuals," which the Bureau of&#13;
the Census excludes from its distribution of families, are considered single&#13;
person families.)-/ The proportion of one and two person US families has risen&#13;
considerably between 1947 and 1972, while the proportion of families in all&#13;
larger sizes has declined. This would be caused by some combination of families&#13;
having fewer children or extended families evolving into smaller nuclear units&#13;
or adults forming households jointly without changing their single marital&#13;
status.-/ As suggested by Garfinkel's prefatory statement, social changes of&#13;
1/ Kuznets (1976), p. 48, provides similar data for a 5 country sample in which&#13;
the percentage of 1 person households ranges from 1.8 (Philippines) to 22.6&#13;
(Germany).&#13;
2/ The institutional population is excluded.&#13;
3/ Since, by definition, a family includes only people related by blood, marriage&#13;
or adoption, unrelated adults living together are counted as single individuals&#13;
in the US data. (This was the case through 1972.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
the kind mentioned above and the growth of the social security system may im-&#13;
ply substantial reduction in economic inequality. However, the use of house-&#13;
hold income as the relevant welfare measure together with the exclusion of&#13;
single individuals from the analysis means that such effects are in part not&#13;
considered. Or if considered in full or in part (single persons excluded), they&#13;
may cause an increase in measured inequality when in reality inequality has de-&#13;
creased. The household PCY concept in contrast avoids these difficulties.l/&#13;

Nevertheless, recent measurement of US income inequality has usually&#13;
been based on the household income concept. A common interpretation of such&#13;
measurement has been that the very substantial increases in government in-kind&#13;
programs and cash transfers designed to reduce inequality since the Second&#13;
World War have had little effect. Measurements of inequality have very nearly&#13;
1/  There are some good reasons for compiling statistics on single person units&#13;
separately from multi-person families. Typically single person units include&#13;
a large fraction of "people on the move" and information on their economic&#13;
characteristics is less reliable, stable or complete compared to that for&#13;
larger units. Again the institutional populations of most societies generally&#13;
contain a disproportionately large number of single person units, and the&#13;
usual omission of institutional inmates from sample surveys implies that a&#13;
biased sub-sample of single person units would be included in random samples.&#13;
Consequently single person units are often left out of the analysis. However,&#13;
by 1972, nearly a quarter of consumer units in the US were of single indi-&#13;
viduals. Precisely because their share in the total was a rapidly increasing&#13;
one, they should not be ignored.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
identical values for the late 1940's and the early 1970's.-/ As suggested&#13;
above, the income concept may be defective. What are the results if house-&#13;
hold PCY rather than household income is used to measure the secular trend&#13;
in US inequality?&#13;
Table 7 answers this question by setting out the Gini coefficients&#13;
for the size distribution of income in the US in recent years using three&#13;
measures. Section (1) is the conventional estimate using family income as&#13;
provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The Gini coefficients are as cal-&#13;
culated by Mortimer Paglin in his 1975 article on US income inequality. (The&#13;
same household income concept and data were used by the five critics of Paglin&#13;
whose comments appeared in 1977.) The estimates of column (1) use an income&#13;
concept which excludes in-kind transfers (public housing, rent supplements,&#13;
food stamps, medicaid) and includes income taxed away. Reynolds and Smolensky&#13;
consequently calculated an after government income distribution as shown in&#13;
section (2). In section (3) we have reworked the data of section (1) using&#13;
household PCY. We did not have the data to do the same for the material of&#13;
Reynolds and Smolensky. In both (1) and (2) the reduction in inequality is&#13;
low for the recent quarter of a century.&#13;
In section (3), between 1947 and 1972 a decline in the Gini coeffi-&#13;
cients of 15.4 percent is the result when the measure is family PCY. This&#13;
1/ See Paglin (1975) and Comments on Paglin's Paper (1977). Even if there&#13;
were    no measurement problems, the conclusion that government programs&#13;
were ineffective would not necessarily follow, since what equality would&#13;
have been without such government intervention is not known.&#13;

Notes and Sources&#13;
(1)       Paglin (1975) p. 604.   These coefficients are based on data of the&#13;
US Bureau of the Census. They are based solely on family incomes. Single&#13;
individuals are excluded. All families receive equal weight in the Gini-&#13;
calculation. The income concept approximates personal income consisting&#13;
primarily of factor earnings and transfer payments.&#13;
(2)       Reynolds and Smolensky (1977) p. 71.   Household incomes for&#13;
families and single individuals are constructed using money NNP as the&#13;
aggregate. Budget incidence is based on their standard incidence assump-&#13;
tions, except that general expenditures are allocated in proportion to&#13;
household incomes. Reynolds and Smolensky also reviewed ten other studies&#13;
of US inequality. All were based on household income and all households&#13;
received the same weight. In all of these, the Gini coefficients were&#13;
little changed in 1970 from 1950. See Reynolds and Smolensky (1977) p. 35.&#13;
(3)       Uses the same data sources as (1).   However the income concept&#13;
is family per capita income. The distribution by families gives each family&#13;
or household equal weight. The distribution by individuals is equivalent&#13;
to the household distribution weighted by family size. The columns headed&#13;
"Families" exclude one person households. The latter are included in the&#13;
columns headed "Family and individuals."&#13;

contrasts to the little changed Gini coefficients for the same years if the&#13;
Gini coefficients are based on family income as in sections (1) and (2). Were&#13;
we able to present the results for family PCY based on family income reduced&#13;
by taxes and increased by government benefits, perhaps a similar decrease&#13;
would be recorded but beginning from a lower Gini coefficient in 1947. If,&#13;
however, the distribution of family PCY over individuals is used then the de-&#13;
cline in inequality is far less. The Gini coefficient for household PCY by&#13;
individuals declined 6.7% over the 1947-1972 period.&#13;
The distribution for individuals gives each person the same weight.&#13;
And since it is based on family PCY and includes the entire non-institutional&#13;
population, it appears to be the best measure. As noted it gives a lower&#13;
decline in inequality (6.7%) than household PCY although more than measures&#13;
used hitherto. These results suggest that the paradox of an apparently un-&#13;
changed degree of statistical inequality notwithstanding very large increases&#13;
in public expenditure to reduce poverty, may be explained in small part by&#13;
moving to a more adequate measure of income.      Using family PCY does indicate&#13;
1/&#13;
a somewhat larger decrease in statistical inequality.&#13;
An interesting question is how has the increase in single person house-&#13;
holds affected the measurement of inequality in the USA. (In the quarter century&#13;
from 1947 through 1972, the share of single person families in total families&#13;
rose from 18% to 24%. See Table 6.) If the income measure is family income&#13;
1/ See also Reynolds and Smolensky (1977): "Why has the redistributive 'bang&#13;
per buck' apparently diminished in the postwar period? Although net govern-&#13;
ment output is distributed in a proper fashion each year, the growth of&#13;
government since 1950 failed to produce a more compact distribution."(P. 77).&#13;
Browning (1976, 1979) concluded, however, that recently there has been very&#13;
substantial reduction in inequality by including public expenditure benefits,&#13;
adjustments for leisure, capital gains and unreported income. Smeeding (1979)&#13;
takes issue with Browning. Both authors rely on household income.&#13;

per household, and if all households receive equal weight, then increasing&#13;
the share of one person units with sub-mean household incomes will necessarily&#13;
increase the measure of inequality -- as noted in Mr. Garfinkel's introductory&#13;
quotation. However if the concept is family PCY, either outcome is possible&#13;
depending on how individual incomes relate to mean household PCY. As indicated&#13;
in Table 7, the addition of single member households to the household PCY mea-&#13;
sure slightly increases the Gini coefficient. In the case of the distribution&#13;
of household PCY by individuals -- the preferred distribution -- the increase&#13;
is 3.7% in 1972. But in the temporal comparison -- using the same distribution -&#13;
the decrease in the Gini coefficients from 1947 through 1972 is very slightly&#13;
larger for families than for families and individuals.-L/&#13;
1/ Kurien (1977) suggested that income inequality can be decomposed into&#13;
choice-related and opportunity-related inequality. Choice-related in-&#13;
equality involves individual decisions on level and type of education as&#13;
well as occupational choice. Hence differences in occupations and their&#13;
associated wages reflect differences in tastes as well as in opportunities.&#13;
The number of earners per household, particularly the degree of female&#13;
participation, is usually a matter of choice. In the USA the number of&#13;
hours to work per year, the size of the family, and household location are&#13;
all matters of choice. All of these variables will affect measures of in-&#13;
come inequality. There is no reason, however, to expect that the net im-&#13;
pact of such measures will remain constant over time. There remains the&#13;
ominous inequality due to elements which the individual is powerless to&#13;
affect: Genetic endowment; environmental influences including the in-&#13;
trauterine, the family, the school, the peer group and the neighborhood;&#13;
endowment of non-human capital; and interactions among these variables;&#13;
"acts of God" or bad luck such as sickness or refugee status or maiming&#13;
due to warfare. Much of the value of the Gini coefficient for the United&#13;
States may be due to choice-related inequality. Implicit in much of the&#13;
policy oriented thought about economic inequality is the ideal of complete&#13;
normative equality. As suggested above, the US may already be at the&#13;
point where a good deal of statistical inequality really reflects welfare&#13;
equality - insofar as welfare is a function of economic variables. This&#13;
suggests that we should be more wary on the meaning we attach to aggregate&#13;
measures of inequality. It may be more useful to deemphasize aggregate&#13;
measures in favor of a focus on clearly disadvantaged groups, such as the&#13;
extremely poor.&#13;

Appendix 1&#13;
Calculation of Gini Coefficients for the USA&#13;
The US data are from the US Government Bureau of the Census&#13;
(1967) and (1975).            Both publications present   their data only&#13;
by family incomes, and for the various family income brackets, by a par-&#13;
titioning according to size of family. Consequently family incomes were&#13;
divided by the number of persons in the family in order to obtain family&#13;
PCY. Families were then reranked according to PCY. Families with seven&#13;
or more members are assumed to have seven members for the computation of&#13;
1/&#13;
per capita incomes.    The Gini coefficients, calculated from the new dis-&#13;
tributions generated in this manner are presented in Table 7 of the text.&#13;
These are trapezoidal Gini's computed according to the formula.&#13;
Gini Coefficient = 1 - Ej(fi+l fi)(Yi   i+l&#13;
where fi = cumulated percent of families&#13;
and Yi = cumulated percent of incomes.&#13;
The data for 1947 are grouped in ten brackets, while the 1972 data are&#13;
grouped in thirteen brackets. The distribution of income within each&#13;
bracket is assumed to be uniform.&#13;
Besides these general assumptions, some specific assumptions are&#13;
made regarding the data for each year. These are, for 1947:&#13;
1/ This bracket contained four and five percent of total families in 1972&#13;
and 1947. See Table 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
(i)       The assumption that the unknown mean family income in each income&#13;
bracket is the middle point of that bracket. The error arising from this&#13;
procedure is likely to be negligible, since for later years, when the mean&#13;
family income in each bracket is available, the data show the means to lie&#13;
very close to the mid-points of the brackets.&#13;
(ii)      Households with negative incomes are considered as having no in-&#13;
come, which is what is required for the calculation of Gini Coefficients.&#13;
Consequently in the lowest income bracket, $1,000 and below, mean incomes&#13;
are assumed to be zero.&#13;
(iii)     For the upper open ended income interval, $10,000 and above, the&#13;
assumed mean family income is $15,600.    This value is obtained by apply-&#13;
1/&#13;
ing the Pareto formula   X   X(iV)&#13;
V-1&#13;
where V = c-d&#13;
b-a&#13;
and X = the estimated mean in the open end interval;&#13;
X = lower limit of open end interval;&#13;
a = logarithm of lower limit of interval preceding open end;&#13;
b = logarithm of lower limit of open end interval;&#13;
c = logarithm of the sum of the frequencies in the open end interval&#13;
and the one preceding it;&#13;
d = logarithm of the frequency in the open end interval.&#13;
For 1972 the only specific assumption employed is the attribution of zero&#13;
mean income to the lowest income bracket (incomes of $1,000 and below).&#13;

Appendix 2&#13;
Equivalence Scales and Household Per Capita Income&#13;
The family or household PCY concept does not take into con-&#13;
sideration economies of scale in operation of households. It also assumes,&#13;
incorrectly, that the welfare from income as expressed by expenditures is&#13;
independent of the age of household members.&#13;
1/&#13;
The work on equivalence scales deals with these two objections.&#13;
A common type of equivalence scale involves work with Engels curves.   Such&#13;
scales  are     based on the assumption that households whose shares of&#13;
consumption on basic goods - food, tobacco, clothing - are equal,enjoy&#13;
identidal levels of welfare without regard to household composition. Given&#13;
a sufficiently large number of points of equal levels of welfare for house-&#13;
holds of different size and ages, one can in turn derive scales of adult&#13;
equivalents for households of different composition as shown in Table 8 for the&#13;
scales using bases such as food expenditure; savings; and tobacco, drink and&#13;
clothing. Other techniques for defining equivalence scales are more arbitrary--&#13;
although not necessarily less correct--than using Engels curves.    A common&#13;
approach is to set a standard for an adequate diet and then estimate the minimum&#13;
costs of providing that diet to different age groups and in turn define an equivalence&#13;
scale in terms of ratios of those minimum costs for households differing&#13;
1/ "Equivalence scales are intended to measure the relative incomes which&#13;
are needed to enable families of different size, or in different circum-&#13;
stances to enjoy the same standard of living." Nicholson (1976) p. 1.&#13;
The product of the correct value of an equivalence scale and the house-&#13;
hold's income gives a measure of the standard of living.&#13;

in size and age of members. Households with equal ratios are presumed to&#13;
have equal living standards. (See equivalence scale D in Table 9). Finally,&#13;
governments also derive schedules for welfare transfers which are based on the&#13;
equivalence scales derived from Engels curves, dietary adequacy, and more&#13;
casual rationales.&#13;
All of the techniques for defining equivalence scales are open to&#13;
objections.    None is scientific.-/Nevertheless there is a fair degree of&#13;
congruence among the various scales, as indicated in Table 8.&#13;
Presumably a size distribution of incomes based on equivalence&#13;
scales is the closest of the three measures of income (household income,&#13;
household PCY and household income per adult equivalent) to an ideal measure.&#13;
In the body of the paper, the US data used in the debate on the trend to&#13;
inequality did not permit conversion to size distributions based on family&#13;
income per adult equivalent. They do, however, permit use of the family&#13;
PCY concept. The question then becomes--how much closer is family PCY to&#13;
the ideal than family income?&#13;
To answer this question we carried out several simulations in&#13;
which we defined an equivalence scale that is more or less the mean of&#13;
those in Table 8.   A household of a single adult equalled 1.1 equivalent&#13;
adults and households with two or more adults had each adult equal to 1.0&#13;
1/ Because the marginal utility from income for the very young--infants,&#13;
toddlers--decreases at a more rapid rate than that of those who are&#13;
older, the use of equivalence scales to adjust incomes biases downward&#13;
the position of high income households with disproportionately high&#13;
numbers of the very young. This bias would be even more pronounced in&#13;
the case of household PCY since young children receive the same weight&#13;
as adults. More generally, the non-comparability of preference functions&#13;
is a limiting factor. In effect the use of equivalence scales always&#13;
involves an assumption of identical marginal utility schedules for&#13;
households of similar demographic composition.&#13;

equivalent adults. Children during the first year of life were measured at&#13;
0.15 adults rising .05 per year until full adult equivalence was attained&#13;
at age 18. We then assumed 3 families with identical incomes. The first&#13;
consisted of a single adult, the second of 2 adults and 4 children aged 10,&#13;
11, 12, and 13; and the third of 4 adults and 6 children aged 6 through 11.&#13;
In all three cases household income was assumed equal to 1.00. Using the&#13;
three measures the results are as follows:&#13;
Incomes&#13;
First   Second   Third&#13;
Household income                          1.00    1.00      1.00&#13;
Household PCY                             1.00    0.17      0.10&#13;
Household income per adult equivalent     0.91    0.21      0.14&#13;
The big change is in the difference between the results for household in-&#13;
come and household PCY.   The difference between household PCY and household&#13;
income per adult equivalent was relatively minor.&#13;
We were able to go somewhat beyond this casual appeal to intuition&#13;
and correlated Malaysian household PCY with the corresponding household in-&#13;
come per adult equivalent. The R2 between the two distributions was .968.&#13;
This result suggests that household PCY may be a very good proxy for adult&#13;
equivalent, unless the Malaysian data are atypical.&#13;

Appendix&#13;
Gini Coefficients and Income Concepts&#13;
An interesting question is whether there is any necessary pattern in the&#13;
Gini coefficients generated for a given population from households distributed&#13;
first by household income, then by household PCY for each household and finally by&#13;
household PCY for individuals. We noted that in Visaria's work (see Part 2) all of&#13;
the results were of a single pattern. For every distribution the Gini coefficient&#13;
for household incomes was higher than for household PCY by individuals. And as&#13;
noted earlier it is also true that in all of the distributions which have come to&#13;
our attention:&#13;
(1)   M = f(Y), f'&gt;O and&#13;
(2)   M = g(Y/n), g'&lt;O&#13;
where M = mean number per household&#13;
Y = household income&#13;
n = number in the household.&#13;
Consequently one might suspect that if the elasticity of household in-&#13;
come to household size exceeds zero but is less than one - as implied by equations&#13;
(1) and (2) - then the Gini coefficient is necessarily lower for household per&#13;
capita income than for household income.-/ Yet simple examples show that the con-&#13;
clusion is invalid. Consider two income distributions (A) and (B) as shown in&#13;
Table 9. In both cases equations (1) and (2) apply. Each has two families.-/ In&#13;
the case of Distribution (A) we have the Visaria pattern with respect to the order&#13;
of the Gini coefficients: The Gini coefficient is lower for household PCY (for&#13;
both definitions) than for household income. Distribution (B), however, does&#13;
1/ There is at least one published instance of this conclusion, e.g. in I.Z.&#13;
Bhatty in "Inequality and Poverty in Rural India" in Srinivasan, T.N. and&#13;
Bardhan (1974).&#13;

not exhibit these results. Rather the Gini coefficient is lowest for&#13;
household income. The ordering of the values of Gini coefficients in&#13;
developing countries using the three income concepts is, therefore, as&#13;
depicted in example A. But this ordering is not of necessity if the only&#13;
restrictions are those of Equations (1) and (2).&#13;
Anand (1978) has shown that if the elasticity of household income&#13;
to household size exceeds unity, then the Visaria pattern of higher Gini&#13;
coefficients for household incomes would be always observed. But Equation&#13;
(2) would have to be invalid, if the elasticity were to exceed one.&#13;

their interpretation the Gini coefficient equals one half the mean difference&#13;
between any two incomes taken at-random divided by mean income. For household&#13;
income the equation is therefore:&#13;
N   N&#13;
(3)  G = [1/2  E    E IY -Y11/N2] - Y&#13;
i=l j=l&#13;
And for household PCY - with each household receiving equal weight - it is&#13;
N   N&#13;
(3') G = [1/2   1 -    |(Y /n9 - (Y /n.)JI/N2] + (Y/n)&#13;
i.=l j=l &#13;
where        i and j = Households&#13;
G= Gini coefficient&#13;
Y. = Household income of household i&#13;
n. = Number in household i&#13;
N = Number of households&#13;
Y = Mean household income&#13;
(Y/n) = (EYi/ni)/N&#13;
In terms of equation (3), in distribution (B), the mean of IY -YI&#13;
is 50 for household income, 150 for PCY of households, and 112.5 for house-&#13;
1/&#13;
hold PCY by individuals.      The corresponding mean incomes are 550, 350&#13;
and 275. And the Gini coefficients are half of the resulting ratios of mean&#13;
difference to mean income.&#13;
Mean income must always decrease in moving from household income to&#13;
household PCY, because household PCY is defined as household income divided by&#13;
household size. Consequently, if the Gini coefficient is to fall the mean&#13;
1/ Set i and j to refer to individuals and equation (3') becomes applicable&#13;
to the distribution by individuals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 31 -&#13;
difference between any two incomes must decrease to a greater degree than mean&#13;
income, because the mean difference is divided by the mean income. As shown&#13;
in example (B), however, it is possible for the mean difference to actually&#13;
increase if the elasticity of income to family size is very low, although still&#13;
exceeding zero.&#13;
Example B suggests an interpretation of the recent US pattern. As&#13;
shown in Table 7 above, in recent decades the US Gini coefficient for household&#13;
PCY by individuals (.390) is much larger than for household income (.359). And&#13;
as in example B, in the US there is weak progression in mean income with family&#13;
size, a progression which is reversed for family size exceeding five persons.&#13;
Because of this low elasticity of household income to household size many of&#13;
the high income families perhaps consist of low income individuals if the&#13;
household PCY distribution is used. If the US results are typical for a&#13;
developed country, it may be that as countries develop, changes associated&#13;
with increasing incomes and smaller families eventually bring a reversal from&#13;
the pattern Visaria found for his five countries.&#13;
The US result--in which household income (Y) is an increasing&#13;
function of size only through 5 persons--has no necessary implication for&#13;
Equation (1), in which family size is the dependent variable, because both&#13;
dependent variables, that is Y in the US example and M in Equation (1),&#13;
are means with variances and probability densities which change as their&#13;
corresponding independent variables take on increasing values. As a con-&#13;
sequence Equation (1) need not imply Y = h(M), h'&gt;O, for all values of M.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Specifically while US data for 1972 show a distinct peak for mean income at&#13;
the size class five persons, the relation of mean family size is positive for&#13;
nearly all household income levels, being only marginally departed from for&#13;
the few incomes in the brackets $1,000 to $4,000 and for incomes greater than&#13;
$50,000.&#13;

            Household income or household income per
            capita in welfare comparisons
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In studies of income distribution,
            household income is the common measure of household welfare,
            although household per capita income is better since it
            automatically corrects for household size. Perhaps the
            continued use of the former is a consequence of the belief
            that in practice the two give very similar results. This
            paper shows that in many cases those results differ
            substantially. The disparity between two Malaysian
            distributions is illustrated by their cross tabulation. A
            quarter of the households in the lowest forty percent of the
            household income distribution is in the upper three
            quintiles of household per capita income; and 10 percent of
            the same lowest forty are in the highest two quintiles of
            the second distribution. The paper also shows that the
            distribution of benefits from public education is very
            inegalitarian if household income is used. The reverse occur
            if household per capita income is used. Similar reversals
            occur in comparisons involving partitions by occupation and
            sex of head of household. Woman headed households, for
            example, have sub-mean household incomes but their household
            income per capita equals the mean. The paper also examines
            the differences in the age-income profiles of the two distributions.
