                                    Box    Caveats and data limitations&#13;
                                   2.1       There are some important caveats about the scope of the fiscal incidence analysis conducted in this special focus section. First,&#13;
                                             by considering the poverty and redistributive effects of fiscal policy, we do not offer a full analysis of whether specific taxes or&#13;
                                             expenditures are desirable. When one tax or expenditure is found to be more redistributive to the poor than another group,&#13;
                                             the temptation is to conclude that the former is preferable. However, redistribution is only one of many criteria that matter&#13;
                                             when making public policy. Good tax policy will aim to be sufficient, efficient, and simple in addition to being equitable, and&#13;
                                             public spending will aim (among other goals) to provide the minimal functions of a state (such as security) and invest in public&#13;
                                             goods (such as infrastructure) that are necessary to ensure prosperity in addition to improving equity. By assessing the equity&#13;
                                             of taxes and spending, the results of this focus section are but one input to public policymaking, a factor that should be&#13;
                                             weighed with other evidence before deciding that a tax or expenditure is desirable.&#13;
                                                  Second, the analysis does not take into account the quality of services delivered by the government. This limitation is&#13;
                                             particularly pertinent to the analysis of spending on health, education, and free basic services, as we discuss in more detail&#13;
                                             later. Second, the analysis excludes some important taxes and spending such as corporate income, international trade, and&#13;
                                             property taxes, and spending such as infrastructure investments due to the lack of an established methodology for assigning&#13;
                                             these outlays across households. Finally, it does not capture the growing debate on how asset accumulation and returns to capi-&#13;
                                             tal affect income inequality.&#13;
                                                  Turing to the data used in the analysis, we also find limitations. The methodology used for data collection in the IES survey&#13;
                                             follows internationally accepted best practice, asking respondents to use a diary as well as recall methods to record their activi-&#13;
                                             ties over a two-week period. It is generally believed that the quality of the incomes and consumption data from the survey is&#13;
                                             good. However, there is some concern that the share of food consumption of the extreme poor in South Africa is much lower&#13;
                                             than one would expect, potentially pointing to some underreporting at the bottom of the income distribution. The IES does not&#13;
                                             separately identify own-produced goods, which could lead to some of this underreporting and lack of comparability with&#13;
                                             international findings. As in other countries, there are questions about the ability of a survey of this type to collect adequate&#13;
                                             information on households at the top of the distribution. Finally, the amounts reported in the IES as expenditure on alcohol&#13;
                                             and tobacco are 17Â percent of that reported in South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s National Accounts. This reflects a large number of households&#13;
                                             reporting zero consumption of these items.&#13;
                                                  To try to control for these possible shortcomings and biases, we conduct various robustness tests. In addition to calculating&#13;
                                             the various measures of income in figure 2.3 from the reported level of net income in the IES, we also cross-check findings&#13;
                                             using the reported level of disposable income, which closely approximates consumption, to calculate the steps in figure 2.3. We&#13;

                                       redistribute income between the rich and the poor?&#13;
                                     The tax and spending system is progressive: the burden of taxes falls on the richest and&#13;
                                     social spending results in sizable increases in the income of the poor.&#13;

questions: How do taxes and spending work                                            PIT and slightly regressive indirect/consump-&#13;

            South Africa economic update : fiscal
            policy and redistribution in an unequal society
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The global economic recovery remains
            uneven, as growth in the United States is gaining momentum
            but appears to be at risk of stalling in the Euro Area and
            Japan. U.S. growth is expected to gain pace over the rest of
            the year and into 2015 as employment prospects boost real
            income growth and confidence. Following the Euro Area&#146;s exit
            from recession in 2013, GDP was flat in 2014, and
            preliminary data for the third quarter suggest slowing
            growth momentum amid weak domestic demand, ongoing balance
            sheet adjustments, a fragmented banking sector, and rising
            geopolitical risks. In Japan, a sales tax hike in April
            caused a more significant contraction in activity than
            expected, while exports failed to pick up.
