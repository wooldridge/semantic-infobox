THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA&#13;
ETHIOPIAN SOCIAL REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
1. ECONOMIC OVERVIEW&#13;
A. GENERAL ECONOMIC SITUATION IN ETHIOPIA&#13;
1.1   Country Background. Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world, with&#13;
a population of over 50 million people and an average per capita income of US$ 130.&#13;
Ethiopia's economic status is reflected in the poor condition of the productive sectors,&#13;
neglected or non-existent infrastructure, degraded environment, and very poor social&#13;
indicators and basic services. Agricultural growth declined from an average of 2.2&#13;
percent a year during the 1960s to 0.5 percent in the 1980s and the early 1990s. The 6&#13;
million hectare under cultivation has hardly increased since the early 1980s. Only about&#13;
2 percent of farm land is irrigated. Agriculture supports about 85 percent of the&#13;
population, but its contribution to GDP has dropped from 65 percent in 1960, to about 40&#13;
percent today. The industrial sector has also stagnated under the previous regime because&#13;
of excessive public sector domination and discouragement of private sector activity, and&#13;
accounts for only 10-12 percent of GDP today.&#13;
1.2   Ethiopia's infrastructure is undeveloped, and has deteriorated significantly due to&#13;
lack of maintenance during the last twenty years. The country's road density is one of the&#13;
lowest in Africa (only 15.2 km per 1000 square km, and only 4000 km of paved roads).&#13;
Nearly three quarters of the country's farms are more than half-a-day's walk from all&#13;
weather roads; and 65 percent of the road network is classified as poor due to inadequate&#13;
maintenance, war damage, and overloading. This adds substantially to vehicle damage&#13;
and transport costs. Limited energy capacity is also a major constraint to development.&#13;
1.3   Ethiopia's population growth rate of over 3 percent has resulted in heavy pressure&#13;
on many areas, resulting in severe environmental damage through stripping of forests for&#13;
fuelwood and poor farming and conservation practices. About 200,000 ha are deforested&#13;
each year. At current rates of soil loss, the areas unable to sustain crops could grow five-&#13;
fold in twenty years, reducing by 15 percent the capacity of land to support its current&#13;
population, reducing incomes by 30 percent in areas with few economic alternatives.&#13;
1.4   The Government's Economic Reforms. In May 1991, the Transitional&#13;
Government (TGE) inherited a devastated economy and massive debt from the military&#13;
dictatorship that ruled Ethiopia for two decades. The TGE introduced an Emergency&#13;
Recovery and Reconstruction Program (ERRP) to jump-start the economy with US$ 650&#13;
million support from an IDA-led donor group. Accompanying this was a program of&#13;
macroeconomic reform which has helped stabilize the economy, dismantle the centrally&#13;
planned system of the previous regime, restore Ethiopia's competitive position through a&#13;
substantial exchange rate devaluation, and open opportunities for private investment. The&#13;
industrial and service sectors responded strongly with growth of 7.6 percent and 9.6&#13;
percent respectively in FY94. Given the economy's heavy reliance on agriculture, the&#13;
FY94 drought reduced GDP growth from 12 percent the previous year to 1.7 percent. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
FY95, the rate of growth was restored to about 5 percent, and is expected to exceed 6&#13;
percent for FY96. Prudent financial management has resulted in greater control over&#13;
inflation and the fiscal deficit, although the increase in economic activities is placing&#13;
pressures on both. An increase in government spending between FY93 and FY95, from&#13;
23.2 to 26.4 percent of GDP, was financed mostly by revenue increases resulting from&#13;
improved coffee exports, and the fiscal deficit1 decreased from 7.1 to 3 percent of GDP.&#13;
The Government is also paying off its debt to domestic banks. Inflation was substantially&#13;
reduced from 36 percent in 1991, and is estimated to be running at the equivalent of an&#13;
annual rate of 13.4 percent, buoyed by foreign exchange inflows and domestic monetary&#13;
expansion.&#13;
1.5   The Government has enacted structural reforms to stimulate investment, trade,&#13;
and production. Exports have been boosted by eliminating all export taxes (except on&#13;
coffee) and reducing license fees. All retail prices have been decontrolled, except for&#13;
pharmaceuticals and petroleum. The top import duty was lowered from 230 to 60&#13;
percent, and the negative import list abolished. The introduction of an auction system has&#13;
improved foreign exchange availability and narrowed the auction and parallel rates to less&#13;
than 10 percent. State monopolies in freight forwarding, marketing, and export activities&#13;
have been abolished, and the banking system opened to domestic private participation.&#13;
The 1992 Investment Code introduced new investor incentives, and the Government has&#13;
embarked on a privatization program under an autonomous Privatization Agency.&#13;
1.6   Macroeconomic and structural reforms have been accompanied by a substantial&#13;
restructuring of public expenditures, shifting resources from defense to social services&#13;
and roads. Education's share of the budget increased from 7.1 percent in FY89 to 13.4&#13;
percent in FY95, and that of health increased from 2.8 percent to 5.4 percent. Allocations&#13;
to roads increased from 3 percent to 14 percent over the same period.&#13;
B. PATTERNS AND SOURCES OF POVERTY IN ETHIOPIA&#13;
1.7   Social Indicators and Social Services. Ethiopia's poverty is revealed by the&#13;
country's social standards. Life expectancy is just 48 years, 117 per thousand infants die&#13;
within the first year, as do twenty percent of children under five. Almost 700 women die&#13;
in childbirth for every 100,000 births. More than 70 percent of the country is susceptible&#13;
to malaria, and tuberculosis is the major cause of hospital registered deaths.&#13;
1.8   Five factors contribute to Ethiopia's poor social conditions. Thefirst is over-&#13;
crowded housing which spreads communicable diseases. The second is lack of safe&#13;
water, producing high rates of diarrhea and schistosomiasis. Only 17 percent of the&#13;
country has access to safe water, compared to the Sub-Saharan African average of 41&#13;
percent. Almost 94 percent of the rural population use untreated water from rivers, lakes,&#13;
and wells. Almost 40 percent of urban dwellers and most rural households have no&#13;
sanitation facilities. The third factor is inadequate nutrition and poor infant feeding&#13;
practices, worsened by chronic diarrhea. The daily per capita calorie intake in Ethiopia is&#13;
1 After grants, on a cash basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
only 76 percent of recommended levels. Between 7 and 10 percent of Ethiopian children&#13;
are moderately to severely wasted, and between 40 and 60 percent of children under five&#13;
are both stunted and wasted. Micro-nutrient deficiencies contribute to high levels of&#13;
goiter, anemia, and rickets. About 1.5 percent of the population is blind due to vitamin A&#13;
deficiency, and about 26 percent suffer from iodine deficiency. Thefourth factor is the&#13;
low education and literacy, which results in high fertility rates, poor maternal and infant&#13;
health, and poor nutrition practices.&#13;
1.9   Thefifth factor is the poor condition of Ethiopia's basic social services. Only 55&#13;
percent of Ethiopian families live within 10 kilometers of a health facility, and only 10&#13;
percent of children under five receive modern health care. Compared to generally&#13;
accepted guidelines, Ethiopia's health stations have to serve twice as many people as they&#13;
should (about 23,000 each), and health centers three times as many (about 317,000 each).&#13;
Despite recent improvements, immunization rates are still well below Sub-Saharan&#13;
African norms, and less than 25 percent of births are attended. Ethiopia has the lowest&#13;
primary education enrollments in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 22 percent, with 16 percent&#13;
fewer girls than boys enrolled. Recent declines in enrollments are due to a combination of&#13;
war damage to about 1,160 primary schools (about 15 percent of the total); the low ratio&#13;
of properly trained teachers; very high drop-out rates (47 percent between grade I and&#13;
grade 2); and poor quality of education.&#13;
1.10  Chronic Poverty. Ethiopia's chronic poverty is the result of high population&#13;
growth rate and poor economic performance. From 1981 to 1991, population grew at&#13;
almost 3 percent a year, economic growth averaged only 1.7 percent a year, and growth in&#13;
agriculture averaged only 0.9 percent a year. Poor economic growth is the result of&#13;
policy distortions under the previous regime; intermittent droughts endangering 7 million&#13;
people; loss of productive land due to environmental degradation; low use of agricultural&#13;
technology; constraints on internal trade due to transport difficulties and state marketing&#13;
monopolies; over-dependence on a small range of exports; domestic conflict and&#13;
insecurity; low rates of investment and savings; and a low level of external development&#13;
assistance ($15 per capita a year compared to Sub-Saharan Africa's average of $34). In&#13;
the decade 1978/9 to 1988/9, per capita food grain production dropped from 200 kg per&#13;
person to about 150 kg per person, matched by increased food imports from 178,200 tons&#13;
to 1,460,400 tons, 70 percent as relief assistance.&#13;
1.11  The World Bank's "Ethiopia- Food Security Study" (June 1992) estimated that&#13;
there are (i) 19 million rural resource poor reliant on farming but unable to obtain&#13;
sufficient food for the household due to inadequate land, livestock, poor climatic&#13;
conditions or soil fertility; (ii) 750,000 poor rural resettlers, inadequately resettled and&#13;
experiencing significant hardship trying to live by farming; (iii) 400,000 urban poor,&#13;
chronically under-nourished, many in women-headed families, spending 85 percent of&#13;
their low income on food; and (iv) 230,000 urban unemployable with no family support-&#13;
structures, unable to work because of age, disability, or mental illness.&#13;
1.12  Transitory Poverty. Transitory poverty in Ethiopia is the result of war, forced&#13;
resettlement, and drought. There are four main categories of transitory poor: (i) rural&#13;
pastoralists in drought prone areas, who have lost their traditional livelihood and coping&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
mechanisms; (ii) groups affected by the war, over two million refugees and persons&#13;
displaced within Ethiopia, households suffering dramatic family losses, the disabled,&#13;
farmers whose means of livelihood was destroyed, and demobilized soldiers; (iii) over&#13;
half million rural refugees from Sudan and Somalia; and (iv) urban dwellers vulnerable&#13;
to policy reform, especially public sector employees being retrenched.&#13;
1.13  Distribution of Poverty. The TGE' 1992 Social Dimensions of Adjustment&#13;
Study classifies almost 52 percent of Ethiopian households as very poor, chronically&#13;
poor, vulnerable, or susceptible nomadic groups. In some areas, the percentage of poor&#13;
households exceeds 70 percent and in the worst cases is as high as 85 percent, with more&#13;
than 50 percent of households in the extremely poor category. In the areas in which&#13;
poverty is especially acute, there is a severe lack of basic social services, acute lack of&#13;
access to safe water supply, and primary school enrollments as low as 7.1 percent,&#13;
compared to the national enrollment average of 22 percent.&#13;
2. CONTEXT FOR THE PROJECT&#13;
2.1   The proposed Project will be an expansion of the pilot Ethiopian Social&#13;
Rehabilitation Fund (ESRF) to all parts of Ethiopia. This section provides the context in&#13;
the form of (i) the development and sector strategies for Ethiopia; (ii) the experience of&#13;
the pilot ESRF; and (iii) lessons from other social fund operations.&#13;
A. DEVELOPMENT AND SECTOR STRATEGIES FOR ETHIOPIA&#13;
2.2   Ethiopia's Development Strategy. Sustained poverty reduction is the main goal&#13;
of the Government's development strategy, to be achieved through a combination of&#13;
sustainable economic growth, improvements in basic social services, and specially&#13;
targeted measures to improve incomes, self reliance, and the quality of life of the poorest&#13;
groups and communities. Drawing on the Bank report "Ethiopia: Toward Poverty&#13;
Alleviation and a Social Action Program (1993)", the aim is to strengthen the capacity of&#13;
the rural population to cope with periodic droughts, and provide food security. Economic&#13;
growth will be the basis for poverty reduction through increased employment and&#13;
incomes, higher food production, and export foreign exchange earnings. The economic&#13;
growth program has four elements. The first is to maintain macroeconomic stability, by&#13;
reducing the budget deficit and domestic bank financing of the deficit, controlling&#13;
inflation, and keeping the foreign exchange rate competitive and interest rates positive.&#13;
The second is to stimulate production through the strategy of Agricultural-Development-&#13;
Led Industrialization (ADLI), which will balance the importance of agriculture as a&#13;
source of income and food, with the sector's limitations in providing employment for&#13;
Ethiopia's rapidly growing population, by increasing output in three areas: (i) in&#13;
agriculture through improved small-holder productivity, and expansion of larger farms,&#13;
especially in the lowlands; (ii) in the industrial and service sectors through improved&#13;
productivity; and (iii) in the production of minerals to diversify Ethiopia's exports. The&#13;
third is encouraging investment through private sector growth, streamlining procedures&#13;
governing investment and trade, and liberalizing the financial sector. The fourth is&#13;
improving infrastructure, services, and natural resource management, through focused&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
;nvestments essential to sustained growth, especially in roads, electricity, agricultural&#13;
services and credit, and environmental rehabilitation.&#13;
Sectoral Strategies&#13;
2.3   This section will summarize the Government's sector strategies related to poverty&#13;
reduction most directly concerned with community-based programs and the proposed&#13;
ESRDF Project.&#13;
2.4   Improving Social Services. A priority goal is to strengthen the social sectors, to&#13;
reduce the population growth rate and improve productivity and employment&#13;
opportunities of the poor, through better basic health, education, safe water and&#13;
sanitation, and nutrition. This program will need to correct regional and urban-rural&#13;
imbalances, improve services to women and children, and encourage a wider range of&#13;
public and private service providers. Between FY91 and FY95, military spending&#13;
reduced from 24.6 percent 13.4 percent of the budget, and allocations for education and&#13;
health increased from 7.1 percent to 13.4 percent, and 2.8 percent to 5.4 percent,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
2.5   Basic Education. The GOE's goal is to expand primary education, and technical&#13;
and vocational training; make access to secondary education more selective and&#13;
competitive; and improve the internal efficiencies cf the educational system. Primary&#13;
education will provide a basis of mathematics and science, promote practical problem-&#13;
solving aimed at future schooling and employment, and increase awareness of the&#13;
physical and social environment. At the primary level, both English and local languages&#13;
will be used as media of instruction. Strong emphasis will be given to community&#13;
involvement in building, rehabilitating, and maintaining primary schools, and in&#13;
participating in basic education management. Efforts are being made to improve the&#13;
training of teachers, upgrade educational materials, strengthen National Regional&#13;
Government of primary and secondary schools, and correct gender and regional&#13;
imbalances.&#13;
2.6   Basic Health and Nutrition. Most of the increased resources for health will go&#13;
to the primary facilities and services, increases in essential drugs and supplies, and more&#13;
and better rural health workers. The goal is to reduce maternal and child morbidity and&#13;
mortality, combat communicable diseases by improved immunization, control diarrhea,&#13;
improve treatment of respiratory diseases, strengthen antenatal care and delivery services,&#13;
and promote nutrition programs linked to MCH. The short term priority is rehabilitating&#13;
war-damaged facilities, especially health clinics at the woreda level, each to be headed by&#13;
a health officer trained to diploma standard. These clinics will provide curative and&#13;
rehabilitative health care and family health services; educate and mcbilize communities&#13;
to improve environmental health conditions (digging latrines, maintaining water facilities,&#13;
and clearing malarial swamps); and encourage community investment in construction,&#13;
and participation in asset management and maintenance. Actions have also been taken to&#13;
establish the new structure of health services at the woreda, zonal, and regional levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
2.7   Population Management. Reducing the growth in population is essential for&#13;
capturing the poverty reduction benefits of economic growth. The GOE aims to reduce&#13;
current high fertility rates from an average of 7.7 children per woman to 4 children, by&#13;
2015. This will be achieved through a significant increase in contraception use; lower&#13;
maternal, infant, and child mortality; increase in girls education and women's literacy;&#13;
programs to increase women's income and economic participation; and information&#13;
programs promoting smaller family size. A National Population Council has been&#13;
established to coordinate this multi-sectoral program, supported by regional and zonal&#13;
population councils and woreda committees.&#13;
2.8   Rural Water Supply and Urban Sanitation. Because of the prevalence of&#13;
diseases related to contaminated water and poor waste disposal, better rural domestic&#13;
water supply and urban sanitation is a major prerequisite for improving the health of poor&#13;
households. The inadequate state of rural water supply in Ethiopia is both a reflection&#13;
and cause of the country's poverty. Only 19 percent of the rural population have access to&#13;
organized water supply, and as schemes are often out of commission actual coverage is&#13;
about ten percent. In some regions, rural communities have almost no access to safe&#13;
water. Domestic investment in rural water supply has declined recently with donors and&#13;
NGOs providing the bulk of the financing. The Government's proposed National Rural&#13;
Water Supply Program (NRWSP) envisages expenditures of US$ 303 million in 13,390&#13;
schemes by 1998, but this program is yet to be fully financed. With limited resources and&#13;
a huge demand, the Governmnent faces a dilemma in balancing new construction with&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation. Currently 83 percent of resources go to new&#13;
construction, and 17 percent to rehabilitation. GOE policy is to promote simple, low-cost&#13;
technology (hand-dug wells and handpumps) for small communities with the principle of&#13;
covering maintenance costs through user fees. Institutional strengthening will be a major&#13;
priority, involving a more rational distribution of responsibility for rural water&#13;
management among regional authorities, ensuring that each region has adequate&#13;
organizational structures, and building effective linkages among regions and between&#13;
regional bureaus and the central ministry.&#13;
2.9   The GOE also gives high priority to improving urban environmental conditions,&#13;
especially sanitation, as part of its program to upgrade the health of the urban poor. The&#13;
approach is to provide urban communities with financial and technical assistance and&#13;
incentives to invest in and manage their own sanitation facilities. The environmental&#13;
aspects related to improved water and sanitation services, particularly disposal of solid&#13;
waste, drainage and refuse disposal, are key concerns in the GOE's National&#13;
Conservation Strategy. The contributions of the ESRF pilot and expanded ESRDF are&#13;
part of a broader effort to improve urban sanitation, which includes the IDA-financed&#13;
Second Addis Urban Development Project, the Ethiopia Water Supply Development &amp;&#13;
Rehabilitation Project to be proposed for IDA financing, and the UNDP-World Bank&#13;
Water &amp; Sanitation Program. The ESRDF will focus on community initiated and&#13;
managed schemes, mainly in Addis Ababa and Harrar, two cities that have the status of&#13;
regions and are therefore included in this otherwise rural program.&#13;
2.10  Small-Scale Irrigation. The ADLI strategy aims to increase agricultural output&#13;
and rural employment and incomes, by boosting the productivity of small-holder farmers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
and diversifying crops to increase the value of exports and reduce fluctuations in&#13;
production. Irrigation will be the primary vehicle for overcoming the formidable&#13;
constraints of unpredictable rainfall patterns and insufficient soil moisture for the&#13;
productive use of modem inputs. The GOE's strategy distinguishes three kinds of&#13;
irrigation schemes. Individual small-scale irrigation schemes cover up to 200 ha, and&#13;
usually consist of diversions from small rivers, springs, or micro-dams to individual&#13;
farmer plots. Medium-scale irrigation schemes, often owned by farmer cooperatives,&#13;
cover areas of between 200 and 1000 ha and generally rely on medium-sized dams or&#13;
diversion methods. Large-scale irrigation schemes are concentrated mainly on state&#13;
farms, and utilize major diversions normally requiring pumping. The GOE gives strong&#13;
emphasis to small-scale irrigation schemes, and envisages more than doubling the&#13;
160,000 ha of land currently under irrigation, utilizing the considerable supply of largely&#13;
untapped ground and surface water in some of the country's major river basins. The&#13;
importance of new and rehabilitated small-scale irrigation schemes are reflected in&#13;
allocated expenditures for the period up to 1996.&#13;
2.11  Programs Targeted at Poor Groups. To supplement measures aimed at&#13;
economic growth, the GOE has launched programs aimed at specially disadvantaged&#13;
groups. These include rehabilitation programs for over half a million refugees returning&#13;
from Somalia, Sudan, and Djibouti; credit and retraining programs for retrenched public&#13;
employees; credit and rehabilitation programs for 500,000 demobilized soldiers;&#13;
consumption programs for 25,000 highly vulnerable households; cash assistance to&#13;
160,000 of the poorest rural households to purchase fertilizer, seeds, tools, and veterinary&#13;
drugs; food/cash-for-work public works programs to improve infrastructure in 15 cities;&#13;
essential agricultural inputs for 150,000 displaced people resettled on farms in Tigray,&#13;
Amhara, Oromiya, and SEPRA; urban food and health umbrella programs for slum&#13;
dwellers in Addis Ababa; and cooperative programs with World Food Program and&#13;
UNICEF for destitute farmers and women, and the unemployed.&#13;
2.12 Regionalization and Community-Based Development. The most important&#13;
political events influencing the development program has been the devolution of&#13;
significant authority and responsibility to the administrations of the newly established&#13;
regions whose status has been confirmed in the December 1994 Constitution for the&#13;
Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. In addition to a range of governmental powers,&#13;
devolution includes a transfer to National Regional Governments of responsibility for&#13;
development planning and project implementation, within the budget allocations and&#13;
broad sectoral policies established by central ministries. The goal of this process is to&#13;
give Ethiopia's various nationalities far greater control over their own political affairs,&#13;
and economic and social development. This trend goes hand-in-hand with the goal of&#13;
increasing the capacity and self-reliance of local communities, encouraging them to take&#13;
responsibility for their own development through community planning and project&#13;
committees. These projects will involve community contributions to project and recurrent&#13;
costs, the use of labor-intensive methods, and the choice of simple technologies that&#13;
communities can maintain. The goal is to utilize this mechanism to deliver small-scale&#13;
projects that communities can manage themselves, focusing on improving community&#13;
health, nutrition, education, and family planning through better basic social infrastructure&#13;
and services; and providing the essential infrastructure (feeder roads, irrigation schemes,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
marketing centers, grain storage, rural power) and training required to stimulate economic&#13;
activities and increase incomes. This process will be supported by intensive training of&#13;
communities, local NGOs, local small private contractors, and other facilitators of&#13;
community-based development. The ESRF pilot has been a major initiative within this&#13;
program.&#13;
2.13 Strategies for the Advancement of Women. The Government places great&#13;
importance on removing the constraints on women's economic and social participation,&#13;
and encouraging their progress. The new constitution guarantees to women the right to&#13;
acquire, manage, and transfer land and property; gives women fundamental social rights;&#13;
and protects women from traditional harmful practices. Development strategies,&#13;
especially at the community level strongly emphasize women's participation in planning&#13;
and implementation; giving women literacy and basic skills to engage in economic&#13;
activities; facilitating access to savings services and credit for income generation&#13;
activities; and supplying simple technologies (such as grain mills and oil seed presses)&#13;
that can help reduce the burden of women's work. Sectoral programs, generally&#13;
implemented through community participation, will have a major impact on improving&#13;
women's economic and social status, especially primary education which will help a&#13;
whole new generation of girls. MCH programs will preserve the health of mothers and&#13;
their infants. Water supply programs will ensure accessible safe water, saving hours spent&#13;
by women carrying water from distant and often contaminated sources.&#13;
2.14 Strategy for Environmental Conservation and Rehabilitation. The GOE's&#13;
National Conservation Strategy (NCS) articulates the policies, strategies, actions, and&#13;
investment program needed to address the main environmental problems confronting&#13;
Ethiopia. Under the NCS, each National Regional Government is responsible for&#13;
formulating regional conservation strategies based on the NCS guiding principles. The&#13;
NCS is comprehensive and multi-sectoral in scope, highlighting the need to (i) limit land&#13;
degradation and loss of tree cover; (ii) respond to the insufficient supply and poor quality&#13;
of water resources; (iii) manage the increasingly serious effects of urban degradation; (iv)&#13;
contain the progressive loss of bio-diversity; and (v) reduce the damage done by poor&#13;
management methods on the ecological stability of rangelands and the livelihood of the&#13;
traditional rangeland populations. The NCS stresses the need for environmental&#13;
objectives in all sector strategies, programs and projects dealing with agriculture, energy,&#13;
roads, water supply, industry, and urban development. Finally, the NCS emphasizes the&#13;
importance of giving communities a stake in conservation and rehabilitation, through&#13;
providing environmental education, the right incentives, stress on environmental criteria&#13;
in community-led project implementation, and methods that the community can readily&#13;
use to preserve their natural resources.&#13;
2.15 World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ethiopia. The Bank's&#13;
CAS for Ethiopia supports the Government's program to promote employment-&#13;
generating economic growth as the long-term foundation for poverty reduction. The CAS&#13;
includes assistance with a policy framework to stimulate production, exports, and private&#13;
sector development; measures to reduce population growth and develop human capital;&#13;
improvement and expansion of essential infrastructure; environmental rehabilitation and&#13;
conservation; and institutional capacity building for economic growth and social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
development. The proposed ESRDF Project is a central element of the CAS. It translates&#13;
into practice a number of important CAS principles: improving project implementation&#13;
by building capacity at a regional level; focusing directly on poverty reduction methods,&#13;
including labor-intensive activity, basic services and infrastructure for poor rural&#13;
communities, improving incomes and food security; increasing the economic and social&#13;
participation of women; and encouraging community concern for environmental&#13;
conservation and rehabilitation. The proposed Project will also contribute to key sectoral&#13;
goals emphasized in the CAS: support to small-holder farmers through irrigation&#13;
schemes; expansion and rehabilitation of rural water supply and urban sanitation;&#13;
improvements in basic health services for the poor; expansion of primary education with&#13;
a focus on increasing girls' participation; and support to community-based initiatives&#13;
aimed at improving essential infrastructure and stimulating incomes, especially for poor&#13;
women.&#13;
B. THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PILOT SOCIAL REHABILITATION FUND&#13;
2.16 The Selection of a Social Fund Mechanism. The pilot ESRF began in&#13;
December 1992 as a component of the Ethiopian Recovery and Rehabilitation Program&#13;
(ERRP). The aim was to test whether a social fund approach could be an effective way of&#13;
giving millions of poor households and communities in one of the world's poorest&#13;
countries, greater control over their economic and social advancement, a goal that could&#13;
not be achieved by central public agencies alone. The devolution of accountability&#13;
implied by a social fund approach coincided with the decision to regionalize political&#13;
authority.&#13;
2.17  The challenge of the ESRF was to see whether the pilot could match the features&#13;
of the most successful social funds, which have been able to make a distinct contribution&#13;
within the range of development approaches. They can provide a parallel track to the&#13;
conventional public-sector planning cycle (which inevitably creates queuing problems)&#13;
by allowing a community with energy and commitment to launch initiatives within its&#13;
own time-frame. Social funds can be an effective way of encouraging private efforts&#13;
which can often deliver more cost-effective results than the public sector alone. They can&#13;
be an effective way of attracting community investment, which reduces the cost to public&#13;
funds and establishes a basis for ownership around which maintenance arrangements can&#13;
be built. The mechanism more readily permits multi-sectoral integration than projects&#13;
designed and managed by public sector agencies. Social funds can also contribute to&#13;
community-based development by building local management skills, encouraging&#13;
community decision-making on joint assets, and developing a sense of achievement and&#13;
self-reliance.&#13;
2.18 Summary of the Pilot Fund Experience. The US$ 13 million ESRF pilot has&#13;
been operating in Southern Shoa, Addis Ababa, and Tigray, with 10 percent of its&#13;
financing available for other regions. Its goal has been to provide financial and technical&#13;
support for small community-initiated projects, in which communities invest at least 10&#13;
percent, and carry contractual responsibility for management and subsequent&#13;
maintenance. ESRF was launched through a promotional campaign to inform&#13;
communities about the Fund's facilities and procedures, identify community needs, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
provide basic training in identifying and submitting sub-project proposals. The pilot&#13;
encouraged management by community committees, and fostered linkages between&#13;
communities and local support groups, local government officials, community&#13;
facilitators, NGOs, and private contractors. Within a general sub-project limit of US$&#13;
250,000, the Fund is open to any initiatives with a positive developmental benefit for the&#13;
community. In practice, the pilot has focused on support for (i) the rehabilitation or&#13;
building of basic health facilities, primary schools, micro-dams, feeder roads, water&#13;
supply and sanitation facilities; (ii) programs in adult skills development and literacy&#13;
training; and (iii) support for income-generating ventures carried out by small groups,&#13;
often consisting of women. ESRF was launched with a modest administrative structure,&#13;
and has operated with an overhead of less than 5 percent of total project cost, which is&#13;
efficient by social fund standards, and compares very favorably with the public sector&#13;
costs of delivering project services.&#13;
2.19 Results to Date. At December 30, 1995, 1,026 proposals had been received, of&#13;
which 462 were regarded as priorities and suitable for appraisal. Subsequently, 67 were&#13;
returned to applicants for reformulation, 170 failed to meet ESRDF appraisal standards,&#13;
and 225 were approved for financing. Six were later canceled due to legal requirements&#13;
and performance failure of implementing agencies, and another nine delayed. In total, the&#13;
ESRF had completed 219 sub-projects by December 30, 1995. Some 564 suitable&#13;
proposals have been placed in the pipeline for consideration by the follow-up ESRDF&#13;
program.&#13;
Evaluation of ESRF Performance&#13;
2.20 Community Participation. ESRF's performance has been measured through an&#13;
independent evaluation after eighteen months operation, a mid-term review in October&#13;
1994, and 6 supervision missions. The evaluation's independent engineers confirmed&#13;
that the infrastructure built with ESRF support satisfied national sector standards and has&#13;
been of good quality. There is also evidence that the ESRF has been successful in&#13;
generating community commitment and helping build community leadership. The Fund&#13;
has received over a thousand community initiated sub-project proposals; and despite the&#13;
fact that many communities have weak local structures, 37 percent of all community&#13;
proposals were drawn up and submitted by community committees themselves. The&#13;
remainder were helped by facilitators such as local bureau staff and NGOs. About 72&#13;
percent of ESRF sub-projects are being implemented by community project committees,&#13;
and in cases where a facilitating intermediary is named as implementing agency, the&#13;
ESRF also requires that a community committee be formed and participate.&#13;

2.21   ESRF Financial Performance. The average cost of the ESRF-financed sub-&#13;
projects compares favorably with similar projects implemented through the civil service.&#13;
As the Table below shows, the ESRF has been able to deliver essential community&#13;
infrastructure at sub-project cost savings of between 6.9 percent and 30 percent.&#13;

2.22   Communities have provided on average 18 percent of total sub-project costs from&#13;
their own resources (in cash or kind), further reducing costs to the public budget, and&#13;
building commitment to maintain the facilities. The fact that community investments&#13;
exceed the 10 percent standard, reinforces the likelihood that these sub-projects are&#13;
genuinely community priorities. Through collaboration with sector bureaus and NGOs,&#13;
ESRF also attracted cost-sharing amounting to 10.7 percent of sub-project costs.&#13;
2.23   ESRF Procedures. The evaluation concluded that the ESRF has followed&#13;
rigorous procedures for sub-project appraisal and implementation, contracting with&#13;
beneficiaries and facilitating agencies, and project accounting and financial control.&#13;
These procedures are described in the Fund's Operational Manual. The evaluation also&#13;
commented on the high quality and dedication of the staff, the Fund's streamlined&#13;
operations, and its rapid responsiveness to community proposals. The performance of the&#13;
ESRF can be demonstrated by the following Table which shows, where comparable data&#13;
is available, that ESRF has been able to make significant time savings in delivering&#13;
projects compared to similar projects delivered through public agencies.&#13;

ESRF pilot consist of those in the poorest and most vulnerable categories: primary&#13;
schooling for over 20,000 children from poor families; training for almost 390,000 adult&#13;
illiterates and destitute ex-soldiers; basic health services for 329,000 inhabitants of poor&#13;
villages; latrines for over 230,000 people, and improved drainage for a further 75,000&#13;
people in the poorest sections of Addis Ababa; rehabilitated feeder roads linking poor&#13;
communities to markets and other essential facilities, benefiting over 780,000 villagers;&#13;
measures to help the productivity of poor peasant farmers: irrigation and micro-dam&#13;
storage for over 1 1,000, storage facilities benefiting 145,000, and conservation measures&#13;
benefiting almost 44,000; and income generation schemes reaching almost 15,000 people&#13;
belonging to vulnerable groups (destitute ex-soldiers, women heads of household,&#13;
displaced civilians, poor peasants, and orphans). The provision of community water&#13;
supply infrastructure has provided 67,000 inhabitants of poor households with safe&#13;
alternatives to untreated water sources at the affordable cost, and has helped reduce the&#13;
burden to traditional women water carriers.&#13;
2.25   ESRF Post-Completion Performance. While it is too early for a definitive&#13;
study on the sustainability of assets created with ESRF support, the evidence is that many&#13;
requirements for future sustainability are in place. For completed sub-projects in water&#13;
supply, urban sanitation, irrigation, income generation, where coramunities have&#13;
contracted responsibility for maintenance and meeting recurrent costs, Community&#13;
Project Committees established to manage implementation have continued to operate to&#13;
manage the maintenance of the assets. For water supply schemes, they operate as Water&#13;
Committees, setting water tariffs and collecting user fees. The collected money, used for&#13;
maintenance and repairs, has so far been sufficient. Completed small-scale irrigation sub-&#13;
projects are managed by Water Users' Committees with their own by-laws and&#13;
regulations, assisted by Ministry of Agriculture extension workers. Users contribute from&#13;
the sale of produce to maintenance and repair costs. Maintenance of public latrines is&#13;
managed by beneficiary families and supervised by the kebele administration, which&#13;
collects user fees and provides keys to door locks that limit access to members.&#13;
2.26  Identified Problems and Solutions. One of the most important reasons for the&#13;
pilot's success was the responsiveness of Fund staff to community needs. Hlowever, the&#13;
ESRF's thin structure was often stretched to its limits and its work schedule delayed.&#13;
Sometimes Fund staff had to provide extensive assistance to bring community proposals&#13;
to an acceptable level for consideration. In many rural areas there was a shortage of local&#13;
contractors with the financial resources to purchase construction materials and facilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
to transport the materials to remote sites. ESRF could often purchase construction&#13;
materials more cheaply from central stocks, and transport it more efficiently using its own&#13;
facilities. In such cases, ESRF took on procurement responsibility, leaving the local&#13;
project committees to deal with labor contracts. The formula worked effectively but&#13;
produced a heavy workload for the Fund. The proposed solution to this problem,&#13;
incorporated in the design for the expanded ESRDF, is a comprehensive capacity&#13;
building program to (i) prepare the Fund for its expanded role; (ii) respond to the&#13;
weaknesses among bureau staff, NGOs, local contractors; and (iii) provide communities&#13;
with skills to manage their own initiatives by training community project committees,&#13;
and strengthen links between communities and local facilitating groups. The Fund is&#13;
recruiting high quality staff for the expanded phase, supplemented with more use of&#13;
short-term consultants for technical studies and specialized supervision. The Fund will&#13;
use sub-contracts with specialized institutions or NGOs in providing training and&#13;
technical support to community organizations and local bureaus. Action will also be&#13;
taken to improve the incentive structure for Fund staff, given that some excellent staff&#13;
were attracted away by higher NGO and international agency salaries.&#13;
2.27  The evaluation found that many income-generating proposals received by ESRF&#13;
were of too low a standard for consideration, demonstrating the need for ESRF to expand&#13;
its research and educational role in this area. ESRF also experienced difficulties coping&#13;
with the work-load generated by the banking aspects of income-generating operations. In&#13;
the future, the Government will support the development of savings and credit&#13;
intermediary organizations, village banks, at the community level.&#13;
2.28  Finally, while it was found that ESRF was committed to maximizing benefits to&#13;
poor women and responding to environmental concerns, establishing specific functional&#13;
responsibilities in the ESRF would improve the attention given to both themes. It was&#13;
also agreed to include more specific gender and environmental criteria for sub-project&#13;
identification, appraisal, monitoring, and evaluation.&#13;
2.29 Additional Regional Studies. To supplement the learning experience of the pilot&#13;
ESRF, rapid assessments were carried out for most regions on their special needs. These&#13;
reports, which are contained in the Project File, provided the basis for the Project Cost&#13;
Projections and the staffing needs of each regional office.&#13;
C. LESSONS FROM OTHER SOCIAL FUND OPERATIONS&#13;
2.30  In addition to the pilot experience, the design of the ESRDF has been based on the&#13;
lessons from some 30 other social funds and social programs the Bank is financing&#13;
mainly in Latin America and Africa. UNDP, the Inter-American Development Bank, and&#13;
the African Development Bank are also supporting social funds. Like most social funds,&#13;
the ESRDF will operate as a semi-autonomous financial and administrative agency,&#13;
reporting to a high level and visible Board, separate from but collaborating with the civil&#13;
service. Like other funds, the ESRDF will have an incentive structure aimed at attracting&#13;
and retaining high quality staff. In line with the findings of the Africa Technical&#13;
Department's study "Social Action Programs and Social Funds, A Review of Design and&#13;
Implementation in Sub-Saharan Africa" (June 1993), the ESRDF will carry out extensive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
community promotion to ensure that proposals are genuinely beneficiary initiated;&#13;
operate with a high degree of autonomy; ensure high standards through rigorous&#13;
appraisal; and work with flexible financing, procurement and disbursement processes to&#13;
encourage community participation in implementation. Most ESRDF financing is likely&#13;
to go to the type of small infrastructure projects shown by social fund experience to be&#13;
most successful in terms of quality and sustainability, and their contribution to&#13;
community efforts to increase incomes and improve their quality of life. Social funds&#13;
operate with an administrative overhead cost of between 5 and 15 percent of overall&#13;
project costs. The ESRF was able to operate at the low end of this range and although the&#13;
ESRDF's overhead expenses will be higher than the pilot phase, because of the&#13;
remoteness and limited capacities of some regions, these expenses will still remain at the&#13;
low end of the range. Overhead costs will be reviewed each year as part of the process of&#13;
approving the annual operating budgets.&#13;
2.31  The ESRDF will also follow other important lessons from social fund experience:&#13;
(i) operating as an action-research program with close monitoring, feedback learning&#13;
loops, and adjustment to varying circumstances; (ii) focusing on building the capacity of&#13;
local community leaders and facilitators to ensure ownership and high quality community&#13;
participation; (iii) using well-tested, simple, and labor-intensive technologies; (iv) being&#13;
managed as an integral part of a broader poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
D. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.32 World Bank's Comparative Advantage. The Bank has strong advantages as a&#13;
supporter of ESRDF. The Project is an essential part of the Bank's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy to support the Government's poverty reduction program. The Bank's close&#13;
involvement in the ESRF pilot, and its experience of many other IDA-financed social&#13;
funds IDA has been used in the Project design to ensure that the Project will respond to&#13;
both Ethiopian realities and lessons from other countries. The Bank is also in an&#13;
advantageous position to attract support for ESRDF from other donor agencies.&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. ORIGINS OF THE PROJECT&#13;
3.1   Based on the evaluation of the pilot, the Government has decided to continue the&#13;
ESRF as part of its poverty reduction program, expand the Fund to all regions of the&#13;
country, organize implementation on the basis of the new regional structures, and&#13;
contribute 15 percent of the expected costs of the expanded phase.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.2   The expanded Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund (ESRDF)&#13;
will provide to poor, mainly rural communities the assets and services needed to improve&#13;
their economic and social standards. ESRDF will provide financial and technical support&#13;
to communities and community groups to construct or rehabilitate, and maintain basic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
economic and social infrastructure and services that they have prioritized and in which&#13;
they are willing to invest. In addition, ESRDF will support community actions aimed at&#13;
environmental conservation and rehabilitation. ESRDF's efforts will be focused on poor&#13;
communities, and especially, poor women. To achieve these goals, ESRDF will&#13;
strengthen community capacity in project identification, implementation, and&#13;
maintenance. The Fund will support only sustainable, cost effective developmental&#13;
initiatives, and will not be involved in relief activities.&#13;
3.3   The Project will also support the establishment of a Welfare Monitoring System&#13;
to strengthen capacity to collect and analyze information related to causes, patterns, and&#13;
incidence of poverty; and improve the basis for developing poverty reduction strategies,&#13;
assessing the impact on the poor of economic policy reform, and evaluating the benefits&#13;
of other poverty reductions interventions.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
1. Roles and Responsibilities in the ESRDF Program&#13;
3.4   Communities. ESRDF will be a demand-based program, and will finance only&#13;
sub-projects that are community-initiated and suitable for community management. For&#13;
each sub-project, the benefiting group or community will form a Community Project&#13;
Committee (CPC) which will participate actively in identifying, preparing, appraising and&#13;
implementing sub-projects, and will be a party to all contractual arrangements with the&#13;
Fund. The CPC is also responsible for collecting community contributions (not less than&#13;
10 percent in cash, kind or labor) to the capital costs of the sub-project, and for managing&#13;
the maintenance of facilities through user fees, and other community contributions.&#13;
3.5   ESRDF. ESRDF is responsible for promoting the Fund among communities and&#13;
National Regional Governments; and for appraising sub-project proposals received from&#13;
communities to ensure that they are cost effective ways of improving community assets&#13;
and social conditions, are developmental and sustainable in nature, and are&#13;
environmentally sound. Once a decision is taken to finance a sub-project, the ESRDF&#13;
monitors and supervises implementation, and ensures a proper hand-over of completed&#13;
facilities to Community Project Committees. ESRDF is also responsible for monitoring&#13;
and reporting on all Fund activities.&#13;
3.6   Facilitators. Communities will be able to obtain support from a wide range of&#13;
facilitators that will collaborate with ESRDF, including NGOs, regional sector bureau&#13;
specialists, private contractors, and specially trained community facilitators.&#13;
3.7   National Regional Governments. Regional sector bureaus will be responsible&#13;
for ensuring that the sub-projects satisfy sector policies and standards; for committing&#13;
budget resources for recurrent costs that are government responsibility; and for providing&#13;
ESRDF technical support in sub-project design, appraisal, and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
2. Organizational Structure of ESRDF&#13;
3.8   ESRDF will operate on a decentralized basis through Regional Offices. The&#13;
ESRDF board is the highest policy level of the ESRDF structure. The ESRDF Central&#13;
Office will plan and manage financial transfers, and monitor and evaluate project&#13;
implementation. Regional Steering Committees will approve sub-projects and ensure that&#13;
the Regional Offices, which receive, process and recommend community applications for&#13;
ESRDF support, operate in accordance with the Operational Manual.&#13;
3.9   ESRDF Board. The Board, chaired by the Prime Minister or representative,&#13;
consists of the Head of the Regional Affairs Bureau, the Minister of Finance, the Minister&#13;
of Economic Development and Cooperation, The Minister of Water Resources, and the&#13;
Minister of Agriculture. The ESRDF General Manager is a member and acts as its&#13;
secretary. The Board is responsible for ensuring consistency with ESRDF policies and&#13;
the procedures of the Operational Manual, for approving the annual budget and work&#13;
program, for approving the progress report, and for appointing the external auditor of the&#13;
Fund's operations.&#13;
3.10 ESRDF Central Office. The Central Office is headed by a General Manager&#13;
who will keep the Board informed on key issues relating to ESRDF's operations. The&#13;
Office is responsible for (i) ensuring that ESRDF operates according to Operational&#13;
Manual; (ii) preparing annually for the Board and IDA a review of ESRDF performance&#13;
(including a financial report), and a consolidated work program and budget based on the&#13;
pipeline of proposals received by Regional Offices; (iii) supervising and monitoring the&#13;
activities of Regional Offices; (iv) replenishing regional accounts on receipt of specified&#13;
financial records and supporting documentation; (v) managing all international&#13;
procurement for ESRDF; (vi) managing the project performance monitoring and&#13;
information system; (vii) managing the capacity building, training, and research program&#13;
and providing technical support to regional offices; (viii) proposing policy changes to the&#13;
Board; and (ix) representing ESRDF in all legal matters. The General Manager is assisted&#13;
by a Deputy General Manager.&#13;
3.11  Regional Steering Committees. Each Committee is responsible for approving&#13;
sub-projects proposed by its Regional Office, once satisfied that they are in line with&#13;
regional development goals. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring that the&#13;
Regional Office follows the requirements of the Operational Manual; and for approving&#13;
the annual financial report, and annual program and budget of the Regional Office for&#13;
submission to the Board and IDA. The Chairperson of the National Regional Council, or&#13;
representative, chairs the Committee consisting of the Heads of the Social Development&#13;
Sector, the Economic Development Sector, the Planning and Economic Development&#13;
Bureau, and the Finance Bureau; and representatives of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia&#13;
or the Development Bank of Ethiopia, and representatives of civic organizations. The&#13;
Manager of the ESRDF Regional Office, appointed by the Chairperson of the National&#13;
Regional Council, is a member of the Committee and act as its secretary.&#13;
3.12 Regional Offices. Ten Regional Offices, (and three Regional Sub-Offices in&#13;
larger regions), are responsible for the day-to-day ESRDF operations, promoting the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
activities of the Fund, processing sub-project proposals, proposing appraised sub-projects&#13;
for financing to the Regional Steering Committee, supervising implementation and post-&#13;
project maintenance, disbursing sub-project funds, preparing work programs based on the&#13;
pipeline of received proposals, maintaining the accounts and project monitoring&#13;
information, and submitting reports and documentation to the Central Office.&#13;
3.13  Staffing of the Central and Regional Offices. The Central and Regional Offices&#13;
are already operation, and are staffed with technical specialists, generally qualified&#13;
engineers, in the main areas of ESRDF's project business, and specialists to manage the&#13;
Fund's administrative, accounting, monitoring, and capacity building functions. The&#13;
organization structure is shown in Annex E, and Map I indicates the location of the&#13;
offices. ESRDF has its own salary structures designed to attract, motivate and retain high&#13;
caliber staff, and special allowances for posts in isolated regions. The staffing levels of&#13;
each office will be reviewed annually to ensure that they are in line with proposed work&#13;
programs and performance.&#13;
3. Project Approach&#13;
3.14  Operational Manual. ESRDF operates according to a detailed Operational&#13;
Manual which satisfies IDA requirements. Modifications to the Manual can be made&#13;
only by the ESRDF Board in consultation with IDA. The Manual (i) contains the policy&#13;
framework and organizational structure of the ESRDF; (ii) describes roles,&#13;
responsibilities, and authority; (iii) defines criteria and procedures for identification,&#13;
appraisal and financing of sub-projects; (iv) specifies implementation, procurement and&#13;
disbursement arrangements; (v) lays out monitoring, accounting, and auditing&#13;
requirements; and (vi) describes the procedures for annual work programming and&#13;
reporting. Annexes to the Manual provide sample contracting documents and standard&#13;
forms for use in processing sub-projects. Adoption of the Operational Manual by the&#13;
ESRDF national Board is a requirement for credit effectiveness.&#13;
3.15 Handbooks. The Manual will be supplemented by Handbooks on Small-Scale&#13;
Irrigation; Social Sectors; Rural Water Supply and Urban Sanitation; Promotion and&#13;
Training; and MIS operation. Cross-cutting themes like gender and environment will be&#13;
included in each Handbook. Handbooks will include project design, appraisal, and&#13;
implementation guidelines; national and regional technical standards and specifications;&#13;
training materials for building the capacity of community committees, practitioners, and&#13;
implementors; and the organizational accountability and framework for supervision,&#13;
quality control, and post-completion maintenance. The Handbooks are being prepared by&#13;
the Central Office in coordination with Regional Offices, taking account of the socio-&#13;
economic features of each region, and highlighting mechanisms to promote community&#13;
participation. Work on the Handbooks has commenced, financed by UJNDP and based on&#13;
terms of reference (available in the Project File) developed in consultation with the IDA.&#13;
While some Handbooks will be ready earlier, all Handbooks will be ready before the end&#13;
of the first year ofproject implementation.&#13;
3.16 Promotional Phase. ESRDF will start operations in new districts with a program&#13;
to promote the objectives of ESRDF among communities, explain its operating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
mechanisms and benefits, describe its experience with other communities, and discuss&#13;
links between ESRDF-financed activities and other development initiatives. This will be&#13;
followed by a participative review of the community's overall needs and priorities, and&#13;
ways in which Fund can assist. Fund staff will assess the capacity of the community to&#13;
identify needs, prepare and submit proposals, and manage implementation and asset&#13;
maintenance. Some initial training may be offered, or plans made to provide training&#13;
later. They will also discuss the possibility of local facilitators to provide assistance. For&#13;
those wishing to submit a proposal for ESRDF support, Fund staff will help communities&#13;
establish Community Project Committees to take leadership of the process. During&#13;
promotional visits, the ESRDF will present its particular mandate within the context of&#13;
overall community needs to improve basic social standards and facilities, improve&#13;
incomes, conserve environmental assets, and attend to the needs of special groups such as&#13;
poor women.&#13;
3.17  Screening and Appraising Proposals. Communities may submit proposals to&#13;
the ESRDF Regional Office directly or with the help of a facilitating intermediary or&#13;
NGO. Proposals can be sent by a Community Project Committee, a local association&#13;
(such as a farmers' group), or a cooperating set of individuals (such as a women's group&#13;
or parents' committee). The Regional Office screens proposals to determine whether they&#13;
fall within ESRDF's business mandate, are relevant to the needs and priorities of the&#13;
community, are the result of community initiative, are presented in a complete enough&#13;
form, and appear feasible. Proposals that fail to satisfy ESRDF standards and criteria will&#13;
be rejected, although ESRDF will arrange for assistance to improve proposals that show&#13;
promise but are in some way defective. After the preliminary screening, a formal&#13;
appraisal will be done by an ESRDF Project Officer in coordination with the regional&#13;
sector bureau concerned, and based on criteria and standard formats included in the&#13;
Operational Manual. The criteria include: (i) suitability of the sub-project to community&#13;
management and maintenance; (ii) the realism of sub-project costs in line with standard&#13;
costs for the sector; (iii) the tangibility and importance of anticipated benefits to the&#13;
community, and the cost benefit (including calculation of an economic rate of return); (iv)&#13;
the cost effectiveness based on the number of beneficiaries reached and consideration of&#13;
least-cost alternatives; (v) satisfaction of national and regional sector technical standards&#13;
and plans; (vi) arrangements for the community's investment of at least 10 percent of&#13;
sub-project costs (in the form of cash, materials, labor, or other services); (vii) the&#13;
adequacy of arrangements for management of implementation and maintenance, and&#13;
coverage of recurrent costs; (viii) responsiveness to the needs of women and other special&#13;
groups; (ix) satisfaction of environmental standards defined in the Operational Manual;&#13;
and (x) the clarity of indicators for sub-project monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
3.18  Project Approval, Financing Agreements, and Implementation. Successfully&#13;
appraised sub-projects will be submitted by the Regional Office to the Regional Steering&#13;
Committee for approval. If approved, the Regional Office will sign a Financing&#13;
Agreement with the Community Project Committee (and with any intermediary acting on&#13;
behalf of communities) specifying the goals of the sub-project, accountability and&#13;
liability, project costs, details of the community contribution, implementation,&#13;
procurement and supervision arrangements, disbursement procedures, special actions&#13;
needed to mitigate any negative environmental effects, and follow-up arrangements for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
maintenance and recurrent costs. Where, as in the case of health facilities and schools, the&#13;
sub-project involves recurrent costs for maintenance and operation for which the regional&#13;
bureau is responsible, the ESRDF will finance the sub-project only once the National&#13;
Regional Government has agreed to take on and budget for this responsibility.&#13;
Agreements will be required on the community's responsibility for maintenance and&#13;
recurrent costs of water-supply, sanitation, and small-scale irrigation schemes. Examples&#13;
of the Financing Agreements are contained in the Operational Manual.&#13;
3.19   Implementation arrangements will be kept flexible to reflect very different&#13;
conditions among the regions in terms of availability of services, markets, and local&#13;
contractors. However, the general principles that will guide implementation will be to (i)&#13;
maximize community involvement and responsibility; (ii) ensure adequate quality; and&#13;
(iii) ensure the most cost-effective methods through competitive bidding.&#13;
D. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
3.20 The sub-projects supported by the ESRDF will depend on community demand.&#13;
However, projections (Table 4) have been made of the likely scope of ESRDF activities&#13;
based on the pilot ESRF, the regional studies, and extensive Govermment surveys of&#13;
community needs. These projections are consistent with the framework of national&#13;
development priorities. The Fund will not preclude any sector, but it is anticipated that&#13;
most infrastructure sub-project proposals will deal with primary health, basic education,&#13;
water supply and sanitation, and small-scale irrigation. Standard costs have been&#13;
calculated for each of these categories, to ensure that ESRDF focuses on small-scale&#13;
activities appropriate to community management and maintenance.&#13;

1. Construction and Rehabilitation of Social and Economic Infrastructure and&#13;
Improvement of Related Services&#13;
3.21   With the legacy of war and neglect, the construction or rehabilitation of basic&#13;
economic and social infrastructure is likely to account for the largest share of ESRDF's&#13;
financial support. ESRDF will encourage economic activities linked to this infrastructure,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
and support sector bureau efforts to improve delivery of social services. This section&#13;
summarizes the detailed economic analyses (available in the Project File) undertaken for&#13;
the main sectors in which communities are likely to request support.&#13;
3.22  Basic Health. The rehabilitation, expansion and construction of primary health&#13;
care facilities (health posts, centers and clinics) will be the core of this program, using&#13;
accepted Government standards. Assistance to refurbish or construct such facilities may&#13;
be combined with ESRDF support for broader regional programs to improve primary&#13;
health care services. These activities could take the form of promotional, educational and&#13;
training activities at the community level aimed at supporting the public health programs&#13;
run by regional bureaus and NGO providers of health care. For example, ESRDF can&#13;
provide programs to educate communities, and especially women, in basic health&#13;
practices and disease prevention, good nutrition practices and the importance of periodic&#13;
assessment of children's nutritional status, and the use of family planning methods.&#13;
ESRDF can also support practical community-based health initiatives, such as clearing&#13;
malarial swamps using non-traditional means, and upgrading the knowledge and skills of&#13;
traditional birth attendants. The Fund will pilot the use of labor-saving devices (such as&#13;
grinding mills and oil presses) and methods to help alleviate the burden of women's work,&#13;
to encourage greater attention to family health and nutrition. By promoting the&#13;
involvement of community committees in the management of health facilities, ESRDF&#13;
will help communities increase the efficiency of basic social services delivery, maximnize&#13;
the benefits of their own and Government investments, and encourage a general shift to&#13;
greater community ownership and participation. The National Regional Governments&#13;
will be responsible for the recurrent costs associated with ESRDF financing of basic&#13;
health facilities, namely the training and salaries of health workers, and the provision of&#13;
medical supplies. Communities will contribute through the cleaning and upkeep of&#13;
facilities, and providing services based on the local situation.&#13;
3.23  Based upon assessments of community needs, it is anticipated that the ESRDF&#13;
will finance the construction of 357 primary health facilities, providing basic health&#13;
services to over 3 million beneficiaries in poor, previously under-served communities.&#13;
This will make an important contribution to improvements in maternal and child health.&#13;
Improved access to preventive health measures will reduce the incidence of infectious&#13;
diseases, and improved access to curative health services will reduce the duration of&#13;
illnesses. Both outcomes will therefore contribute to increased household productivity.&#13;
The Ethiopia Rural Household Survey (1994/95) indicates an average illness rate at any&#13;
time of 346 per 1,000 people, and an average individual rate of nine illness episodes a&#13;
year each lasting on average 9.6 days. This translates into 258 million person days of&#13;
disability for a population of three million, the number that will benefit from the ESRDF&#13;
basic health component. Based on a varying levels of effectiveness of the ESRDF&#13;
provides health centers in reducing disability rates (from 33 percent to 75 percent), the&#13;
direct economic benefits would be captured in terms of worker income gained 2, Based&#13;
on the range of health center efficiency, the economic rate of return (ERR) of the&#13;
2 The calculations used both market daily wage rates for rural workers, and the shadow wage rates for&#13;
unskilled labor (60 percent of market wage)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
component would range from 32 percent to 67 percent, and an average health center&#13;
efficiency rate of 50 percent would yield an ERR of 46 percent.&#13;
3.24   Basic Education. Sub-projects in this sector will include (i) the rehabilitation,&#13;
expansion, or construction, and equipping of primary schools, based on accepted&#13;
Government standards; and (ii) adult training, including literacy training (especially for&#13;
women), training in the use of simple technologies and methods, training in business-&#13;
related skills, training for special groups such as farmers and those responsible for water&#13;
management, and training for communities in development need identification and&#13;
project management. In addition, ESRDF will support community initiatives to use the&#13;
school as a center for other development activities, and encourage community&#13;
participation in basic education management. These initiatives could include the&#13;
establishment and training of parents' committees to play an active role in the operation&#13;
of the school and the teaching of their children. As in the case of basic health, the Fund's&#13;
role beyond infrastructure provision, will focus on educational and promotional activities&#13;
that support the efforts of the regional educational bureaus and NGOs working to&#13;
improve basic education. For example, the Fund can help promote efforts to improve the&#13;
educational participation of girls and reduce their drop-out rates; and can help provide&#13;
training for children in environmental issues and methods of natural resource&#13;
conservation. The National Regional Government will be responsible for recurrent costs&#13;
associated with ESRDF financing of basic education facilities, namely the training and&#13;
salaries of teachers, and the provision of educational supplies. Communities will&#13;
contribute through the cleaning and upkeep of facilities, and may offer other services. In&#13;
line with Govermment policy, parents will also contribute through different forms of&#13;
investment in their children's education.&#13;
3.25   Based on an assessment of community needs, it is anticipated that the ESRDF will&#13;
finance the construction of 238 primary village schools and 102 urban elementary schools&#13;
in poor communities currently without such facilities. These facilities will add 108,000&#13;
additional children to educational enrollments each year, which constitutes about five&#13;
percent of the current primary school population. The quantifiable direct economic&#13;
benefits are related to additional earning potential from those who complete primary&#13;
eduication. The Rural Household Survey (1994/95) indicates that completion of primary&#13;
education on average doubles incomes earned, producing an ERR for the ESRDF basic&#13;
education component of 16 percent.3 The component will also have important tangible&#13;
benefits that cannot be readily quantified, including lower fertility rates for girls attending&#13;
school, and improved child health practices by educated mothers.&#13;
3.26   Rural Water Supply. ESRDF will finance water-supply sub-projects to raise the&#13;
health standards of rural communities and assist in reducing women's burden of fetching&#13;
water. These sub-projects will promote the use of low-cost and simply maintained&#13;
technologies appropriate for direct community participation, with a special emphasis on&#13;
ground water resources (hand-dug wells, spring development, and boreholes). In the&#13;
selection of technologies, careful attention will be given to cost-effectiveness related to&#13;
3 The calculation deducted the opportunity cost (herding, farmn help, and child minding by young girls)&#13;
from the benefit stream. The calculations use the value of labor at their shadow price rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
the size of the community, the expected lifetime of the facility, and the capacity of the&#13;
community to take responsibility for upkeep and repairs. The Fund will also take care to&#13;
integrate smaller community initiatives with larger mainstream sector development&#13;
programs, through close liaison with regional water bureaus. In terms of recurrent costs&#13;
related to the provision of water-supply schemes, the goal is that they will be self-&#13;
sustaining, through community user fees that will be used to maintain the facilities. All&#13;
Financing Agreements with communities will therefore specify the community's&#13;
responsibility for maintenance, and describe the community management structures and&#13;
procedures for collecting and applying user fees to cover facility maintenance. Special&#13;
encouragement will be given to the representation of women on community water&#13;
committees.&#13;
3.27  While the actual number and distribution of schemes will depend on community&#13;
proposals, based on ESRF assessments of community needs, it is anticipated that the&#13;
ESRDF will finance 13,035 rural water supply schemes (8,913 hand-dug wells, 1,492&#13;
spring developments, and 2,630 shallow wells) providing safe water for the first time to&#13;
communities with a total population of 3,381,500 people. The most direct economic&#13;
benefit of this component will be productivity gains through improved health resulting&#13;
from avoidance of disease contaminated water. At any time, 72 per thousand Ethiopians&#13;
suffer from diarrhea-related illness resulting from unsafe water. The provision of safe&#13;
water to 3.4 million people through the ESRDF, would (on the basis of an assumed&#13;
modest 50 percent reduction in diarrhea-related illness) save 3 million person days of&#13;
productive labor. This ERR will be increased by two other important benefits: lower&#13;
household medical expenses due to lower incidence of disease; and the release of&#13;
women's time (otherwise used in carrying water from traditional sources) for income-&#13;
eaming activities, as well as better attention to family nutrition, and improved conditions&#13;
for increasing girls' school attendance. The overall ERR for this component will be 24.5&#13;
percent.&#13;
3.28  Urban Sanitation. Through sanitation sub-projects, ESRDF will contribute a&#13;
healthier environment in urban residential areas, and help improve public health. Two&#13;
main types of sub-projects will be financed: latrines, and rehabilitation or construction of&#13;
drainage systems. Based on the success of such schemes in Addis Ababa during the pilot&#13;
period, ESRDF will ensure a significant degree of community investment and ownership&#13;
in the implementation of these sub-projects. As in the case of water-supply facilities, the&#13;
maintenance of sanitation facilities will be self-financing, through a system of user-&#13;
charges, subscriptions, and community labor efforts. I he Financing Agreements will&#13;
include details of the management processes and rules for covering the recurrent costs at&#13;
the community level. Based on assessments of community needs, it is anticipated that the&#13;
ESRDF will finance 45 latrine and 23 drainage schemes, mainly in Addis Ababa where&#13;
there is an acute need and the basis for community collaboration is most advanced. These&#13;
facilities will serve 147,000 beneficiaries, and make an important contribution to the&#13;
containment of epidemics (especially dysentery and cholera), which are a continual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
danger in the poorest districts of the city. Based on the best available comparative data4,&#13;
the labor days saved due to improved health resulting from such facilities, will produce&#13;
an ERR of 37 percent.&#13;
3.29   Small-Scale Irrigation. Where small-scale irrigation schemes have been&#13;
successful, they have provided many rural communities with a valuable, albeit limited,&#13;
input for local food supplies and livestock management. These schemes in Ethiopia are&#13;
essentially community based. To provide water security in an equitable manner,&#13;
cultivators are allocated a small parcel of irrigated land to supplement their traditional&#13;
production from rain-fed crops and animal husbandry. During and after the rains,&#13;
irrigation is used to secure and enhance production of field crops. In the dry season, the&#13;
emphasis is on mixed horticultural crops. Storage dams are also important in providing&#13;
water for livestock during drought conditions. Although there are abundant water&#13;
resources in Ethiopia, their harnessing and utilization is costly owing to the seasonal&#13;
characteristics of stream flow. Economy of water development will be a key aspect of&#13;
ESRDF support for small-scale irrigation schemes. During the life of the Project, cost&#13;
comparisons will be made between ground water utilization and the cost effectiveness of&#13;
schemes relying on surface water. Initially, the ESRDF will promote the use of&#13;
traditional and well-tried technologies suited to local management and operation, and the&#13;
limited maintenance resources available under prevailing conditions. Over time,&#13;
however, ESRDF will encourage efficiency in the management of the irrigation system&#13;
through research and into improved modern methodologies now finding their way into&#13;
developing countries. A key appraisal priority will be to match the investment in water&#13;
catchment or storage facilities with the economic returns likely to result from cultivation.&#13;
Therefore, a careful assessment will be made of the land to be cultivated through&#13;
irrigation to determine fertility, crop choice and suitability, siting, and long-term&#13;
sustainability. ESRDF will support the efforts of the agricultural bureaus and extension&#13;
workers to train farmers in irrigated farming methods, and in the maintenance of water&#13;
catchment infrastructure and irrigation schemes. In its appraisal of small-scale irrigation&#13;
sub-projects, the ESRDF will take account of the community's access to the essential&#13;
agricultural inputs needed to ensure that the full potential of the investment is captured.&#13;
Close attention will also be given to factors like susceptibility to flood damage, silting,&#13;
dam safety, environmental and water-related health factors, and the interests of&#13;
downstream communities.&#13;
3.30   Although the schemes to be supported through ESRDF will be modest in size,&#13;
they will become a vital factor in the economic well-being of the communities they serve,&#13;
and the Fund has special responsibility to guard against failure. It is also recognized that&#13;
there is limited capacity in this sector in Ethiopia to carry out the special variety of&#13;
assessments and tests that are needed to assure effective results. The Fund will therefore&#13;
4 There is not sufficiently reliable urban health data for Ethiopia, so the ERR calculations draw on the&#13;
Rural Household Survey which reveals an average rate of 9 illness episodes a year lasting for an average of&#13;
9.6 days. As urban health trends may be expected to be more positive than rural trends, the ERR makes an&#13;
assumption that improved sanitation will prevent two of those nine episodes which is modest considering&#13;
that diarrhea-related illnesses constitute one of the major burdens of disease in Ethiopia, afflicting over&#13;
seven percent of the population at any time. Calculations use shadow wage rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
work in close association with all available expertise in the country, regional bureaus,&#13;
NGOs experienced in the sector, and private contractors. ESRDF has also agreed, where&#13;
necessary, to utilize the services of international specialists in the initial capacity-building&#13;
period, to provide on-site supervisory assistance and on-the-job training. Experts in the&#13;
Bank team will also actively participate in supervising these components closely until it&#13;
is clear that the necessary local capacity has been mobilized. The Bank will collaborate&#13;
with the International Program for Technology Research in Irrigation and Drainage&#13;
(IPTRID) in providing this support. The maintenance and recurrent costs of these small-&#13;
scale irrigation schemes will be the responsibility of the beneficiary farmers' groups that&#13;
will organize a water charge system to raise financing for repairs and upkeep. The source&#13;
will be the proceeds from cultivation and livestock, although in specific locations,&#13;
communities may agree to contribute as well. Regional bureaus will carry out periodic&#13;
inspections and provide advice.&#13;
3.31   Based on assessments of community needs, it is anticipated that the ESRDF will&#13;
finance earth dam and river diversion schemes, providing irrigation for 18,715 hectares of&#13;
arable land. This will provide additional production and income for 87,844 households,&#13;
or 439,220 household members. Using Ministry of Agriculture data, the ERR for this&#13;
component was calculated using eight alternative farm models5 that illustrate the types of&#13;
investments to be supported by the ESRDF small-scale irrigation component. The&#13;
analysis revealed a range of economic returns, the lowest being schemes which&#13;
concentrate on lower value cereal crops irrigated by higher cost storage dams, and the&#13;
highest being those that devote as much hectarage as possible to higher value vegetable&#13;
crops (potatoes, onions, peppers) irrigated by lower cost diversion canals.6 The ERR&#13;
calculations indicated that the "break-even" least attractive investment option would&#13;
consist of schemes devoted to 75 percent cereal crops using storage dam irrigation. The&#13;
most viable schemes are those devoted to 50 percent or more vegetable cash crops using&#13;
diversion canals. The ERR, based on these two combinations, would range from three&#13;
percent to 24 percent, with a median value of 13.5 percent. In practice there will be a&#13;
number of variables (in addition to crop yields, market prices, and irrigation scheme&#13;
construction costs) that will need to be taken into account during appraisal of ESRDF&#13;
small-scale irrigation sub-projects. For example, crop selection will depend on soil&#13;
suitability and availability of other inputs in addition to seeds; revenues from crops will&#13;
be subject to variations in local markets; and the choice of potential irrigation schemes&#13;
will depend on topology, nature of the water source, rainfall patterns, availability of local&#13;
inputs, and other factors. Based on this economic analysis, the Operational Manual will&#13;
contain a methodology for sub-project appraisal of small-scale irrigation schemes&#13;
(utilizing all important variables) aimed at maximizing the ERR, and ensuring that only&#13;
viable schemes are financed.&#13;
5 These consist of four combinations of typical higher and lower value crops, and two types of irrigation&#13;
systems to be supported by the ESRDF: diversion canals from rivers, and storage dams.&#13;
6 Storage dams cost about twice as much as diversion canals on a per hectare-irrigated basis; and lower&#13;
value cereal crops produce per hectare returns of only a third to a half of that produced by higher value&#13;
vegetable crops.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
3.32  Because ESRDF-financed small-scale irrigation activities will be undertaken on&#13;
international waterways, notification procedures required under OP 7.50 have been&#13;
carried out, and the Government has provided that maximum water abstractions from&#13;
these rivers will not exceed the agreed limits.&#13;
3.33  Other Forms of Infrastructure and Services. Rural and feeder roads are an&#13;
essential part of an integrated approach to improving the economic and social well-being&#13;
of communities given the isolated nature of many parts of the country. ESRDF will&#13;
support community proposals for the improvement of small stretches of local roads,&#13;
especially where they complement and are essential for the success of other ESRDF-&#13;
financed activities in a community. ESRDF will also support community proposals for&#13;
other type of basic infrastructure that can help improve economic and social conditions&#13;
(such as market places and grain storage facilities). In addition to helping improve social&#13;
service delivery as part of social infrastructure sub-projects, the Fund can consider&#13;
separate social service improvement sub-projects, and a variety of training proposals.&#13;
ESRDF will work closely with communities that have innovative proposals that may&#13;
require refinement, and will collaborate with all agencies working at the community&#13;
level.&#13;
2. The Welfare Monitoring System&#13;
3.34  The Project component to support the establishment of a Welfare Monitoring&#13;
System will assist the development of poverty reduction policies and programs, and&#13;
improve monitoring of the social consequences of wide-scale development activities.&#13;
Information generated by the system will support policy makers and planners at both&#13;
national and regional levels, enabling them to (i) identify poor and vulnerable groups for&#13;
targeted programs; (ii) assess the short and medium term effects on the poor of&#13;
macroeconomic and sectoral policies and programs; (iii) monitor changes in status of&#13;
poor and vulnerable population groups; and (iv) identify key policy issues for designing&#13;
effective poverty alleviation strategies. The Project will help build capacity in collection,&#13;
analysis and use of welfare monitoring data through provision of training, analytical&#13;
programs and equipment, and assistance with survey-related costs.&#13;
3.35  The Welfare Monitoring System will come under the authority of a high-level&#13;
National Welfare Review Committee with overall responsibility for the review of poverty&#13;
and welfare conditions in the country, and for the coordination of poverty alleviation&#13;
efforts. The Committee, assisted by a Welfare Monitoring Unit (WMU) established in&#13;
the Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation, will specify the outputs that the&#13;
system is to produce, and coordinate the efforts of various contributors. One of the&#13;
regular outputs will be an Annual Review of Social Trends and Welfare. Other studies to&#13;
help monitor and better understand poverty in Ethiopia will be organized by the&#13;
Committee through the WMU which will administer a Welfare Monitoring Study Fund to&#13;
pay for many of the outputs expected of the system (poverty profiles, gender studies, food&#13;
security reviews etc.). In addition the fund can finance qualitative and participatory&#13;
poverty assessments to complement the statistical data generated by the Central Statistical&#13;
Authority (CSA) and line ministries, or employ consultants to undertake specially&#13;
commissioned data collection or data processing activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
3.36 The WMU will be a coordinating and commissioning agency, contracting for&#13;
surveys and analyses on a competitive basis. Possible suppliers of services and&#13;
information include line ministries, the university and research centers, and private&#13;
consultants. No institution will have a monopoly, and the Welfare Monitoring System&#13;
will foster utilizing a wide range of acceptably qualified organizations and specialists to&#13;
carry out data gathering, processing and analytical functions. However, as there is a&#13;
shortage of effective survey agencies at this stage of Ethiopia's development, and because&#13;
of the urgency of establishing the necessary poverty data base, assistance will be given to&#13;
strengthening the CSA, the agency with the most advanced institutional capacity. This is&#13;
not intended to restrict entry for others, and the CSA will in fact sub-contract as soon as&#13;
other providers emerge with the required capacity. In addition to ensuring high standards&#13;
through competition, the widening of the range of suppliers will help meet the increasing&#13;
demand for survey work in Ethiopia (including regional surveys) and enable in-country&#13;
specialists to manage, coordinate and participate in all surveys in Ethiopia.&#13;
3.37  The project will help CSA strengthen its data collection and processing&#13;
capabilities, and its storage and data library facilities. The urgent need for training,&#13;
technical assistance, vehicles, and equipment for data processing and analysis will be&#13;
provided through Norwegian assistance to strengthen the WMU and to enable the CSA to&#13;
undertake welfare monitoring surveys. These include an agricultural survey; an income,&#13;
expenditure and consumption survey (with a poverty module); and the initiation in 1995&#13;
of the Annual Review of Social Trends and Poverty Survey. Agreement has been reached&#13;
on an easy-access policy for wide distribution of welfare monitoring data to interested&#13;
users and analysts. The Welfare Monitoring System with help from the Project will also&#13;
support the strengthening of regional data processing and analytical capacities, as well as&#13;
skills in poverty-focused planning capabilities, possibly through the creation of Regional&#13;
Poverty Review Committees and Welfare Monitoring Units at the regional level. A fuller&#13;
description of the Welfare Monitoring System is given in Annex I.&#13;
3. Capacity Building, Training and Research&#13;
3.38  The major implementation challenge for the ESRDF will be the current weak&#13;
capacity in some regions of Ethiopia. The pilot project demonstrated that both the ESRF&#13;
institutional structure and community structures could be made to work with the&#13;
necessary level of facilitating support from regional bureaus, NGOs, and private&#13;
contractors. The pilot also identified a range of technical areas, quite aside from&#13;
variations among regions, where it will be vital to strengthen capacity, especially in the&#13;
construction of micro-dams and irrigation schemes. In addition, the expansion of the&#13;
Fund will require a program to build the capacity of new Community Project&#13;
Conmmittees, activate a wider range of facilitators, and train additional Fund managers&#13;
and staff. The ESRDF capacity building program is a major component of the Project,&#13;
not only critical to successful implementation, but also a significant contribution to&#13;
building capacity in the country's new regional structures. The program will include a&#13;
practical research component aimed at improving understanding of community needs,&#13;
effective implementation methods, and the ESRDF's impact on poverty reduction and&#13;
community well-being.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
3.39  Objectives and Beneficiaries of the Capacity Building Program. The Program&#13;
aims to (i) provide ESRDF with the capacity to manage the Fund and carry out the&#13;
responsibilities describcd in the Operational Manual; (ii) provide local community&#13;
leaders and associations with the skills and knowledge needed to participate fully in sub-&#13;
project management; (iii) strengthen the capacity of local facilitators to support&#13;
communities in ESRDF a,ctivities; and (iv) build critical technical capacity in the Fund&#13;
and among its collaboi 2ting partners. At all levels, training will emphasize the&#13;
importance of environmental zonservation, the special needs of women and other&#13;
disadvantaged groups, methods of cost recovery, strategies for ensuring sustainability,&#13;
and ways to incorporate improved service delivery in infrastructure sub-projects. The&#13;
capacity building program will be financed in part by a tNDP program support project&#13;
that will help coordinate co-itributions from other soairces for capacity building activities&#13;
in the project. The program will build on the success of the UNDP support project for&#13;
ESRF pilot, and the regional capacity building project UNDP is supporting under the&#13;
Management of Technical and Economic Change Program.&#13;
3.40  Capacity Building for ESRDF. The ESRF pilot established valuable base&#13;
capacity for the expanded Project, and some pilot staff will take their experience to new&#13;
Regional Offices. However, the expanded Fund will require extensive recruitment and&#13;
training of project staff in ESRDF procedures, methods of promotion and community&#13;
strengthening, and sector technical knowledge. Training priorities for staff in the Central&#13;
Office include the management of the central accounting and monitoring of decentralized&#13;
operations; techniques of building local capacity; and effective methods of building&#13;
sustainability, targeting investments, improving basic social service delivery, and simple,&#13;
labor-based technologies. In addition to skills development, the program will include&#13;
establishing computer-based systems, and supervision and monitoring processes; and&#13;
providing essential office and transport facilities.&#13;
3.41   Capacity Building for Communities. ESRDF will provide training and other&#13;
forms of technical support to enable Community Project Committees to identify needs,&#13;
manage the sub-project cycle, and maintain the assets developed through Fund support.&#13;
ESRDF will work with communities to help identify individuals held in high regard by&#13;
the communities, and who can be trained to act as community facilitators, assisting&#13;
communities with proposals, supervising implementation, training beneficiaries in asset&#13;
maintenance, and acting as a link with ESRDF Offices.&#13;
3.42 Capacity Building for Collaborating Agencies. ESRDF will need the help of&#13;
regional bureaus and NGOs in the implementation of the Fund's program. In some cases,&#13;
it will be necessary to strengthen the capacity of such agencies to operate within the&#13;
procedures of the Fund, to increase their skills in working participatively with&#13;
communities, and to increase their technical capabilities in specific sectors.&#13;
3.43  Approaches to Capacity Building. Many capacity building priorities are already&#13;
well analyzed and programs are being designed to meet the needs of various groups.&#13;
These include training for community leaders and organizations in managing the sub-&#13;
project cycle, and basic training in Fund procedures for new Project staff. Other&#13;
programs will be tailor-made for the special needs of a group of beneficiaries, specialists,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
or facilitators, working on specific sub-projects or sectors. Special programs will be&#13;
designed in the management of rural water supply, and as described earlier, specialists&#13;
will be contracted to provide on-the-job, on-site supervision and training support in&#13;
micro-dam construction and small-scale irrigation. The sector handbooks will be an&#13;
important way of conveying essential technical knowledge and capturing the best of&#13;
ESRDF experience through regular updates. The capacity building program will also&#13;
support selective overseas training and study tours to experience different effective&#13;
approaches to community-based development. A more detailed description of the&#13;
program is contained in the Project File.&#13;
3.44  A number of elements have been included to ensure that the capacity building&#13;
program is cost effective. While ESRDF Central Office will manage and ccordinate the&#13;
capacity building program, training delivery will be contracted to a network of local&#13;
training agencies, NGOs, and consulting specialists selected both for their experience and&#13;
to ensure adequate coverage. To ensure the best outreach in dissemination of training to&#13;
the regions, the program will use a training-of-trainers approach to build a network of&#13;
skilled community facilitators and specialists. As the success of the ESRDF depends&#13;
upon the collaboration of many players in a country with limited capacity, training&#13;
programs will include a wide range of participants: community leaders, ESRDF&#13;
specialists, regional bureau sector staff, collaborating NGOs, and private contractors.&#13;
Fund staff responsible for coordinating the capacity building program will participate in&#13;
training to monitor impact and make judgments about cost effectiveness.&#13;
3.45  Study Fund. The program will include a Study Fund under Central Office&#13;
management, which can be used to increase the effectiveness of ESRDF activities. The&#13;
Study Fund can be used for on-going studies on operational and technical aspects of the&#13;
ESRDF, as well as the participation of and impact on beneficiaries, and will go into&#13;
greater depth than the regular MIS, using both MIS data and additional research.&#13;
Regional Offices and Central Office specialists will also be able to make proposals to use&#13;
the Study Fund for special assignments (for example, market research linked to income&#13;
generation and small business opportunities, alternative simple technologies, methods of&#13;
cost recovery, critical links among sectors, labor-based implementation), and the Central&#13;
Office will propose the most relevant of such proposals in the Annual ESRDF Program.&#13;
ESRDF will also cooperate with the Welfare Monitoring Unit and participating donors to&#13;
research issues relating to sustainability, and the effectiveness of ESRDF community-&#13;
based methods and their broader applicability.&#13;
E. SPECIAL ISSUES RELATED TO PROJECT PERFORMANCE&#13;
3.46  Environmental Factors. The ESRDF has two environmental goals. Thefirst is&#13;
to ensure that each sub-project will be reviewed at appraisal, using environmental criteria&#13;
contained in the Operational Manual, to identify any potentially negative environmental&#13;
impact. Such potentially negative consequences will require agreement on appropriate&#13;
mitigating measures, and ESRDF will be responsible for monitoring such measures. Sub-&#13;
projects found to have a negative environmental impact that cannot be mitigated will not&#13;
be financed. The only potential area of concern relates to small-scale irrigation, where&#13;
action will be taken to avoid adverse effects on soil quality, siltation, and the risk of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
water-borne disease. These potential problems will be dealt with through special features&#13;
of project design, close monitoring, and technical support to communities, as described in&#13;
the Small-Scale Irrigation Handbook. The second objective is to use ESRDF as a vehicle&#13;
to actively pursue the GOE's environmental objectives, promoting better conservation&#13;
practices and maximizing the positive environmental impact of ESRDF sub-projects (for&#13;
example, tree planting schemes associated with social infrastructure, improvement in&#13;
urban environmental conditions through sanitation schemes, and specific sub-projects&#13;
targeted at terracing, soil improvement, and water conservation).&#13;
3.47  An Environmental Analysis was conducted and its results are detailed in Annex J.&#13;
The main recommended mitigation measures have been integrated into the project design.&#13;
Sub-components that include physical investments will be submitted to Environmental&#13;
Impact Assessments according to the requirements, rules and regulation of the&#13;
Government of Ethiopia. The training for ESRDF staff, community organizations, and&#13;
facilitators will focus on environmental factors in sub-project design, and the actions that&#13;
can limit negative consequences. Training will also promote effective conservation and&#13;
rehabilitation practices, and explore opportunities for sub-projects to contain conservation&#13;
components. The Operational Manual includes a check-list of such opportunities.&#13;
3.48 Impact on Women. ESRDF has developed a gender impact assessment and&#13;
action plan consisting of four elements. Thefirst is a Gender Checklist to be used during&#13;
project screening and appraisal to identify whether a proposed sub-project has a&#13;
potentially negative impact on women. If such an impact is anticipated, agreements are&#13;
required on suitable mitigatory measures to make the sub-project eligible. The second is a&#13;
policy to give special consideration to proposals that emphasize benefits for women.&#13;
ESRDF's promotional activities will focus attention on women's priorities and needs, will&#13;
support (through training and other means) the active participation of women in&#13;
Community Project Committees), and help to establish women's groups to pursue&#13;
proposals of special interest to them. Thirdly, ESRDF will make every effort to recruit&#13;
women staff, and already has had some success in this endeavor. In each ESRDF office,&#13;
a staff member will be responsible for promoting and coordinating activities related to&#13;
women, and all ESRDF staff and facilitators will be trained in ways to maximize benefits&#13;
to women and encourage their participation. Fourthlv. the management information&#13;
system will capture and report information on the participation of women in ESRDF and&#13;
the impact of sub-projects on women. The research program will also focus on the role&#13;
women have played, and the project approaches, designs, and methods that have helped&#13;
increase benefits to them. The Gender Action Plan is included as Annex K.&#13;
3.49  Consistency of Operation. Consistency of operation will be an important&#13;
consideration, because of the Project's decentralized implementation. Measures have&#13;
been built into the Project to ensure consistency within the ESRDF and with broader&#13;
sector policies and strategies. All major decisions and activities will be based on the&#13;
procedures of the Operational Manual (which is part of the Proclamation setting up the&#13;
Fund), and guided by sector Handbooks. The ESRDF Board, representing all Regional&#13;
Councils, will monitor operations of the Regional Offices for consistency, through semi-&#13;
annual and progress reports prepared by the Central Office. The project monitoring&#13;
system includes performance indicators and specifications aimed at measuring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
consistency. The replenishment of Regional Offices' accounts will take place only if the&#13;
Central Office is satisfied that Regional Offices have operated consistently within&#13;
ESRDF procedures. Finally, Regional Steering Committees will need to be satisfied that&#13;
sub-projects are in line with sector plans and standards before agreeing to finance them.&#13;
3.50 Pace of Implementation. The pace of implementation in each region will vary&#13;
because of the considerable differences in institutional capacities. The first year of&#13;
implementation will focus on strengthening the operational capacity of ESRDF Regional&#13;
Offices. In the initial period, the identification, processing, and implementation of sub-&#13;
projects will take place more gradually in weaker regions than in those already involved&#13;
in the pilot or those that start with a stronger institutional foundation. The&#13;
Implementation Plan, which blends capacity building and operational activities, is shown&#13;
in Annex F.&#13;
3.51  Sustainability of the ESRDF Mechanism. Although implemented nationwide,&#13;
ESRDF will operate as a pilot in new communities that have received little sustained&#13;
outside support for their own developmental initiatives. The decentralization of ESRDF&#13;
to regional management is also part of the pilot process. ESRDF will actively pursue&#13;
experimental approaches to community management and participation, the use of simple&#13;
labor-based technologies, improvements in the quality of basic social service delivery,&#13;
and improved arrangements for maintenance of assets and services directly involving&#13;
community responsibility. By decentralizing the process, and linking it closely with&#13;
regional and community structures, the goal is to integrate the ESRDF's participative&#13;
approach into local development activities. This will provide the Government with an&#13;
option as to whether to launch a further phase of ESRDF after the Project closes, or to&#13;
integrate the approach into regional development management. The close collaboration&#13;
between the ESRDF and regional bureaus, the capacity building program, and the&#13;
experience provided by the Project in managing community-based development, should&#13;
all help ensure the sustainability cf the methods introduced by the ESRDF&#13;
3.52 Sustainability of ESRDF-Financed Assets and Services. The ESRDF's&#13;
approach should enhance the likelihood of sustainability, by promoting private initiatives&#13;
and giving beneficiaries a direct stake in improved assets and services. Five aspects of&#13;
ESRDF design are aimed at promoting sustainability. Thefirst is community ownership:&#13;
ESRDF will finance only those initiatives proposed by communities as their priorities,&#13;
ensuring full community participation in sub-project design and implementation. The&#13;
second is the requirement that communities provide at least 10 percent of total project&#13;
costs, and wherever possible larger contributions (in the pilot project, community&#13;
investments reached over 25 percent in some sectors). The third is rigorous screening&#13;
and appraisal to ensure sub-projects are viable, will deliver expected benefits to the&#13;
community in keeping with standard costs, and can be maintained at reasonable expense&#13;
and with local technical capacity and resources. Sub-projects which have an estimated&#13;
cost of US$ 200,000 or more will be eligible for financing only if appraisal can&#13;
demonstrate an economic rate of return of 12 percent or more. Thefourth is to make&#13;
specific provisions for maintenance and recurrent costs through (i) a clear contract in the&#13;
Financing Agreement concerning sector bureau and community responsibilities; (ii) a&#13;
specific maintenance schedule and standards; (iii) an organizational structure at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
community level responsible for managing the asset or service; (iv) adequate financial&#13;
and technical arrangements (regional bureau budgeting of recurrent expenses, cost&#13;
recovery schemes to finance maintenance funds, availability of spare parts and&#13;
maintenance services, and technical training for community specialists); and (v)&#13;
arrangements for monitoring maintenance and screening new proposals based on&#13;
maintenance performance. The ESRDF approach of encouraging the integration of&#13;
linked sub-projects based on an overall understanding of community needs and priorities,&#13;
can also help to enhance sustainability. Finally, the monitoring and research program will&#13;
help identify and respond to problems of sustainability at an early stage before&#13;
deterioration has reached the point where it is too expensive to reverse.&#13;
F. THE DEVELOPMENT SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ESRDF&#13;
3.53  ESRDF has been designed to fit the development realities of Ethiopia. Sustainable&#13;
economic growth will lay the foundation for long term poverty reduction. This needs to&#13;
be complemented by actions that will enable millions of poor people in isolated rural&#13;
communities to take advantage of the benefits that economic growth can bring. Such&#13;
benefits could pass them by unless there are significant improvements in their standards&#13;
of health, education, and their access to water, a scarce and vital asset for domestic and&#13;
farming use. The escape from poverty will also depend on the capacity for households to&#13;
increase their meager incomes. Some will be able to do so through improved farming&#13;
methods utilizing water provided by small-scale irrigation schemes supported by careful&#13;
conservation of natural resources. However, because of significant land-population&#13;
pressure in the poorest areas of the country and the high cost of expanding land under&#13;
c.Altivation, many others will need to rely on off-farm employment. These priorities are&#13;
the main-stream of ESRDF business, and the Project is a central part of the poverty&#13;
reduction strategy.&#13;
3.54 Ethiopia's commitment to regional devolution will bring development decisions&#13;
closer to communities and increase their responsibility for the development process itself:&#13;
the identification of priorities, the design and management of interventions, and the&#13;
maintenance of assets. The ESRDF has been designed to utilize the new regional&#13;
institutional structures, to stimulate the participation of beneficiary communities (in terms&#13;
of investment, management, and responsibility for sustainability), to strengthen working&#13;
relationships among governmental bodies, NGOs, and private sector contractors, and to&#13;
build the capacities of all involved in this participative developmental approach.&#13;
3.55 ESRDF Compared to Other Options. The ESRF was piloted to determine&#13;
whether a specialized financing agency could jump-start the process of participative&#13;
community-based development to empower local communities right from the outset, and&#13;
to compensate for the inevitable length of time that it will take to strengthen weak&#13;
regional institutions. In addition to testing whether the mechanism would work (respond&#13;
to beneficiary-initiated proposals and deliver the priority infrastructure and services&#13;
required), it was also important to ensure that the Fund could do so at acceptable costs&#13;
and levels of effectiveness and efficiency. Through the pilot, the Fund has demonstrated&#13;
its capacity to foster and respond to community-led efforts, and to deliver good quality&#13;
infrastructure and services with significant community investment, at lower costs and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
more efficiently than could be done by public agencies. To some extent, this is a&#13;
reflection of the careful limits placed on the ESRF's activities. The Fund operates with&#13;
small projects that are suited to community participation, using simple technologies and&#13;
established sectoral standards. Any experimental or risky ventures are introduced strictly&#13;
on a pilot basis so that they can be closely monitored. The work load of the Fund is also&#13;
carefully attuned to the delivery capacity of Fund offices, especially the work load of&#13;
Project Officers. (Calculations based on the pilot experience are contained in the Project&#13;
File). The ESRDF is therefore not a replacement for larger-scale public agency&#13;
responsibility for delivering sector programs. It is an essential complement, because&#13;
while the Fund ensures that sector standards are respected, it can respond rapidly and&#13;
flexibly to community initiatives. Its streamlined structure and operating procedures,&#13;
financing mechanism independent of the civil service budget, ease of operation across&#13;
sectors, and planning process based upon a pipeline of community proposals, gives the&#13;
Fund some special advantages over public agencies, and well placed to work directly with&#13;
beneficiaries. Without the Project, many ESRDF objectives could be achieved through&#13;
public programs, but at much higher cost and over a longer time frame. This would&#13;
especially disadvantage thousands of poor communities in some of the poorest parts of&#13;
the country, where it will take time to build effective regional public institutions. The&#13;
unique contribution of ESRDF is its ability to work closely and respond rapidly to poor&#13;
communities, and to mobilize the contributions of specialists from the public, private and&#13;
NGO sectors to build the capacity needed for participative poverty reduction efforts.&#13;
G. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
3.56   Direct Project Benefits. The Project will contribute to Ethiopia's program of&#13;
economic and social reconstruction by providing new or rehabilitated infrastructure and&#13;
services in a number of vital basic sub-sectors. If sub-project proposals match the&#13;
assessment of community needs (based on the experience of the pilot and the rapid rural&#13;
appraisals), by completion the Project would have (i) irrigated 18,715 hectares serving&#13;
almost 88,000 households and contributing to the income of almost 440,000 household&#13;
members; (ii) provided 13,035 rural water supply facilities (hand-dug wells, spring&#13;
developments, shallow wells) benefiting 3.4 million members of poor communities with&#13;
no satisfactory alternative access to safe water; (iii) constructed 45 sets of communal&#13;
latrines and 23 drainage schemes benefiting 147,000 people in the poorest parts of Addis&#13;
Ababa and Harar; (iv) constructed or rehabilitated and equipped 357 primary health&#13;
facilities serving over 3 million people in poor rural communities; and (v) constructed or&#13;
rehabilitated 340 elementary schools, serving 108,000 children from poor rural families.&#13;
The Project will make an environmental contribution through water conservation and&#13;
sanitation schemes, and through measures to conserve or rehabilitate natural resources. 7&#13;
3.57   The economic benefits attached to ESRDF sectors have been described in the&#13;
sections covering each sector. Based on the Project cost projections, the economic rate of&#13;
7 The Project will have many indirect benefits that will be difficult to measure, because of other intervening factors.&#13;
These include the investment by women of time saved through water supply projects in income-earning activities and&#13;
better nutritional practices; and through the small-scale irrigation component, increased local availability of food in&#13;
food-insecure areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
return of the ESRDF package as a whole will be 22.6 percent. The total discounted&#13;
benefit streams of US$ 369 million exceed the discounted cost streams of US$ 231&#13;
million, and the Project will generate an overall net present value of economic benefits of&#13;
US$ 138 million (using a discount rate of 12 percent). (The full economic analysis is part&#13;
of the Project File).&#13;
3.58   Impact of the Project on the Poor. The Project will operate largely among poor&#13;
rural communities including those living in the poorest regions of Ethiopia, where well&#13;
above half the households are below the poverty line (many spend most of their income&#13;
on food and still do not escape malnutrition), trying to subsist on agricultural activities in&#13;
areas suffering from intermittent severe drought and some severe environmental&#13;
degradation, and without even the most basic health and education services or safe water.&#13;
A limited number of sanitation sub-projects will benefit the urban poor in Addis Ababa&#13;
and Harrar. While most assets and services created through ESRDF will benefit the&#13;
communities as a whole, special care will be taken to maximize the benefits to&#13;
disadvantaged groups. It is estimated that the ESRDF will bring benefits to an estimated&#13;
7.1 million people living in the poorest areas and communities of the country, providing&#13;
them access to assets and resources that will enable them to improve their incomes,&#13;
increase their economic security, and improve their social conditions. The design and&#13;
processes of the Project will pay special attention to the needs and opportunities of poor&#13;
women, many of whom head single parent households, and who are the largest, least&#13;
resourced and most vulnerable group in the country.&#13;
3.59   Cost Savings. If the Government were to invest in community infrastructure&#13;
through more conventional public programs, the ESRDF approach would offer&#13;
substantial savings. Using figures more modest than the savings achieved by the ESRF&#13;
pilot, the Table below indicates that the ESRDF could deliver its results at about 82&#13;
percent of the cost of a public agency managed program, a saving of about US$ 47&#13;
million.&#13;

3.60 Contribution to Regional Capacity Building. The Project will make an&#13;
important contribution to building the capacity and self-reliance of local communities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
and strengthening regional institutions and facilitating organizations (both governmental&#13;
and non-governmental). Capacity building will provide managerial and participative&#13;
skills needed to support community-based development activities, and the analytical and&#13;
technical skills necessary for sound investments and sustainable projects. Substantial&#13;
ESRDF-financed contracting for local services will provide the local private sector&#13;
opportunities to learn new techniques and consolidate their businesses. The Project will&#13;
also make contributions to building knowledge in some vital areas: simple, community-&#13;
based technology and labor-intensive methods; methods of maximizing private&#13;
investment in construction and maintenance of basic social and economic infrastructure;&#13;
community-based approaches for conserving and rehabilitating the country's degraded&#13;
natural resource base; and (through the Welfare Monitoring System), the underlying&#13;
patterns and causes of poverty in Ethiopia.&#13;
3.61   Risks. The success of the ESRF pilot was due to the fact that it was management&#13;
intensive; was operating in three limited areas; and was cost-effective because the&#13;
infrastructure in the pilot regions is relatively developed. These factors will not be as&#13;
favorable under the expanded ESRDF, and the project will face some risks in terms of&#13;
efficiency. The main risks relate to limited institutional capacity in some regions where&#13;
even governmental structures are still in a rudimentary state. Implementation will begin&#13;
more slowly in areas in where capacity is weak, so that the ESRDF can concentrate on&#13;
building skills and putting community management structures in place. The ESRDF&#13;
Regional Offices will come under great pressure to assist communities prepare their&#13;
proposals, and to act as technical advisors, which could strain the Fund's modest staffing.&#13;
In addition to attracting and retaining the highest caliber staff through its improved&#13;
incentives, the Fund will respond to community needs by forming partnerships with a&#13;
network of NGOs, sector agencies, and domestic and foreign private contractors, and&#13;
will train local community facilitators to work directly with community groups.&#13;
3.62  The decentralized structure of ESRDF presents challenges in achieving quality&#13;
standards. Four measures are being taken to ensure these: (i) the comprehensive but&#13;
simple Operational Manual setting out technical, cost, and quality standards, supported&#13;
by sector technical handbooks and pre-designed forrns and computer systems; (ii)&#13;
oversight by a national Board representing the highest regional and national officials with&#13;
a common interest in the effective operation of ESRDF; (iii) special training programs for&#13;
regional office staff and local facilitators, especially in sector technical areas,&#13;
supplemented by on-site supervisory help from domestic and foreign experts; and (iv) a&#13;
rigorous process of monitoring, reporting, and supervision. The Central Office will be&#13;
given adequate human and financial resources to track project progress through a rigorous&#13;
monitoring system, and support performance through training and technical assistance.&#13;
3.63   There should be no significant risk of Government failure to provide recurrent&#13;
costs for the operation and maintenance of basic education and health facilities created&#13;
with ESRDF support, as the recurrent costs and staffing implications are not additional to&#13;
projected sector requirements and have already been included in projected budgets and&#13;
plans. However, the sustainability of water supply, irrigation, and sanitation&#13;
infrastructure created through the Project will depend on communities keeping to their&#13;
commitments to maintain and repair infrastructure, and collect user fees to cover&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
recurrent costs. As these communities are among the poorest and most vulnerable in the&#13;
country, they are also the ones most susceptible to economic shocks. However, for the&#13;
first time in generations, Ethiopia has a political and economic program that promises&#13;
stability and growth. Although there are no guarantees, the risk of collapse has to be&#13;
balanced against the realization that stability and growth are unlikely without programs&#13;
such as the ESRDF.&#13;
3.64 The Government, UNDP, the Netherlands, Italy, and Norway have already&#13;
committed support to this Project, and other donors, including Sweden and Finland, have&#13;
expressed interest. While most of the commitments are expected to materialize, there is&#13;
still some risk that the full project costs will not be financed up-front. As the ESRDF is a&#13;
demand-based program of small sub-projects based on an annual plan and budget, a&#13;
financing gap at credit effectiveness would not present a problem as long as additional&#13;
donor support emerges during the project's lifetime. The worst scenario, a continuing&#13;
financing gap, would simply mean that the Project would expend its financing earlier&#13;
than the planned five year period and this need not be significantly detrimental.&#13;
H. LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
3.65 A Government Proclamation (law) has been issued, which establishes ESRDF as&#13;
a semi-autonomous national entity, operating according to procedures specified in its&#13;
Operational Manual which include special procurement and disbursement rules that will&#13;
give ESRDF its needed flexibility. (A copy of the Proclamation is contained in the&#13;
Project File). ESRDF will collaborate closely with the central and regional bureaus, but&#13;
will not be part of either structure. The financial allocations made to ESRDF Regional&#13;
Offices will be recorded as budget allocations to regions, but financial flows will take&#13;
place directly to ESRDF offices through a channel separate from the Ministry of Finance&#13;
allocation to regional governments. There will be no blending of ESRDF financing with&#13;
regional bureau resources, and ESRDF will operate and be audited as a separate&#13;
accounting center. ESRDF will inherit the assets and liabilities of the pilot ESRF.&#13;
3.66  Community Project Committees (CPCs) will act as implementing agencies and&#13;
sign Financing Agreements with ESRDF. Wherever possible, CPCs that already have&#13;
some legal status, or some other representative body that is registered and has legal&#13;
capacity to act on behalf of the benefiting community will be selected. In some cases,&#13;
particularly in urban areas, ESRDF will enter into agreement with a CPC, under the seal&#13;
of a registered village association that will accept accountability on behalf of the CPC. In&#13;
some remote areas there may be no such intermediaries, and normally the community will&#13;
elect its own under the requirement that 50 percent of the households identify an adult&#13;
member to sign the minutes of the meeting that elects the CPC. The minutes will be&#13;
countersigned by the woreda administration through a simple process similar to that of&#13;
notarization, and attached to the Financing Agreement. Prior to completion of sub-&#13;
project appraisal, the ESRDF Project Officer will verify through informal interviews with&#13;
the community whether the CPC election meeting took place in the manner required, and&#13;
will check on a random basis, whether the signatories actually reside in the community.&#13;
The Operational Manual contains a copy of the Financing Agreement, and guidance on&#13;
the important terms and conditions to be included in the Financing Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

1. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1. Annual Plan and Budget, and Annual Review&#13;
3.67  The Project Cost Projections (described in detail in the Project File) are based on&#13;
(i) an assessment of community needs in different regions; (ii) standard costs for various&#13;
sectoral activities in Ethiopia; and (iii) the implementation performance of the pilot&#13;
project after 27 months of operation, including data on work load factors, and project&#13;
processing times. Because the Project is demand-based, actual implementation and&#13;
disbursement will be determined by a pipeline of eligible community proposals, subject&#13;
to the capacity of each Regional Office. These will form the basis of the Annual Plan and&#13;
Budget supported by a Review of the previous year's performance, prepared by each&#13;
Regional Office, reviewed by the Regional Steering Committees, and consolidated by the&#13;
Central Office into a composite ESRDF Plan and Review for final authorization by the&#13;
National Board in consultation with IDA. Regional submissions for the Annual Review,&#13;
and Annual Plan &amp; Budget will be based on standard formats linked to the MIS system&#13;
(Details are contained in the Operational Manual, and summarized in Annex D). The&#13;
Annual Plan and Budget also establishes annual targets for selected key performance&#13;
indicators (shown in Annex D) which will be closely monitored throughout project&#13;
implementation. The first year's plan, which has been agreed by IDA, is based on an&#13;
assessment of the needs and proposals anticipated from conimunities within a broad&#13;
indicative resource envelope established for each Regional Office. Adoption of the first&#13;
year 's Work Program and Budget by the ESRDF national Board is a requirement for&#13;
credit effectiveness. In subsequent years, the plan and budget will be based on progress&#13;
made in disbursing fumds against sub-projects being implemented, and the pipeline of&#13;
screened or appraised sub-project proposals.). The Welfare Monitoring Unit will prepare&#13;
an annual implementation plan and budget for the Welfare Monitoring Program which&#13;
will be sent to the Welfare Review Committee for final authorization, in consultation&#13;
with IDA.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
3.68  As shown in Table 6, the total projected costs of the Project are estimated at US$&#13;
243 million equivalent (net of tax and custom duties). These projections took account of&#13;
war damage, existing state of infrastructure, range of economic opportunities and&#13;
population size in each region, as well as the capacity of the ESRDF mechanism to&#13;
deliver (details contained in the Project File).&#13;
3.69 The Project will be financed by an IDA credit of US$ 120 million equivalent&#13;
representing 49.5% of the total project costs. The Government's contribution is estimated&#13;
at about US$ 36 million, part of which will cover the operating costs of the ESRDF,&#13;
estimated at US$ 13.15. The Community contribution will be about US$ 24 million.&#13;
UNDP is providing US$ 6 million towards the capacity building program, and other&#13;
donors about US$ 56 million to project costs. The operating costs of the Fund will be&#13;
reviewed each year according to delivery efficiency and work load to ensure that they are&#13;
justified in terms of operations delivered. It is anticipated that in its first year the ESRDF&#13;
will be unable to achieve the operating efficiency of the ESRF pilot, firstly because the&#13;
project will be launched in new areas that have limited capacity, and secondly because&#13;
much of the ESRDF's time in the first year will be spent on promotion, project&#13;
identification, and capacity building tasks to lay the foundation for more rapid&#13;
implementation from the second year onwards. However, the experience of the first year&#13;
will be used to establish expectations on operating costs for individual regional offices&#13;
and the ESRDF as a whole, and the Fund will be expected to operate within these limits.&#13;
It is anticipated that operating costs will be in the low end of the scale of operating costs&#13;
that are typical for Bank-financed social funds.&#13;
3.70  Recurrent Costs Implications. The projected ESRDF recurrent costs, ajoint&#13;
responsibility for benefiting communities and Government should present no major&#13;
problems. The main Government responsibility for recurrent costs, the equivalent of 0.55&#13;
percent of FY95 recurrent expenditures, will relate to the provision of personnel,&#13;
supplies, and equipment for schools and health facilities. From the project's fifth year,&#13;
this will average US$ 2.98 million for schools and US$ 1.53 million for health facilities,&#13;
equivalent to an increase of 2 and 7 percent respectively of the FY95 current recurrent&#13;
budget for these sectors. In all other ESRDF sectors, beneficiary communities will carry&#13;
most of the recurrent costs. In irrigation, Government's contribution will be limited to&#13;
some periodic maintenance that cannot be done by communities, meaning a recurrent cost&#13;
implication to the Government budget estimated at US$ 770,000 from the fifth year of&#13;
the Project. Communities will be responsible for recurrent costs for the maintenance of&#13;
Rural Water Supply schemes, raised through user fees. The regional Water Resource&#13;
Development Bureau will supply spare parts at cost to the Community Committees, carry out&#13;
water quality tests, provide training for motorized pump operators and make follow-up visits&#13;
to ensure that the system is properly managed. They will also carry out any major repairs&#13;
beyond the capacity of the communities. The Government recurrent costs are estimated&#13;
at US$ 220,000 from the fifth year of the Project. During each sub-project appraisal,&#13;
ESRDF will ensure that the relevant Government agency is brought into the appraisal&#13;
process and their concurrence to providing financial and technical support for the sub-&#13;
project obtained before sub-project approval. Sanitation schemes will be maintained fully&#13;
by community user fees.&#13;

3.71   The Table below shows the recurrent costs to be carried by communities. The&#13;
ESRF pilot demonstrated the capacity of communities to manage and pay for the&#13;
maintenance of Fund-financed water supply, sanitation and irrigation infrastructure. In&#13;
the expanded ESRDF, rural water supply will constitute the largest recurrent cost&#13;
category for communities. Most schemes will require low cost, simple maintenance,&#13;
suitable for community ownership and management. For more complex schemes,&#13;
ESRDF will ensure that the benefiting households are aware of the cost implications for&#13;
maintenance, and integrate capacity building into the project design.&#13;

3.72   The daily costs to households for ESRDF-financed water supply is shown in the&#13;
Table below. Most recurrent costs for spring development and hand pump schemes will&#13;
be met through the provision of labor and services. The higher cash contribution for&#13;
motorized pump schemes represents about 3 percent of a poor family's income.&#13;

3. Procurement&#13;
3.73 The Proclamation establishing ESRDF, permits ESRDF to follow the&#13;
procurement rules detailed in its Operational Manual. These rules have been designed to&#13;
encourage commnunity participation; support sub-project sustainability; and respond to&#13;
regional differences including disparities in the institutional capacity of communities, and&#13;
in the local availability of services, markets, and contractors. Procurement arrangements&#13;
will be reviewed by IDA every six months, and steps taken, where needed, to improve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
economy, efficiency and process transparency. Sample tender documents and contracts,&#13;
acceptable to IDA, have been developed for national competitive bidding and contracting&#13;
based on the experience of the pilot phase, and are included in annexes to the Operational&#13;
Manual. Procurement for the Welfare Monitoring Component will be handled by the&#13;
Welfare Monitoring Unit.&#13;
3.74  In addition to monitoring the procurement operations of the Regional Offices and&#13;
implementing agencies, the ESRDF Central Office will manage all international&#13;
procurement of goods or construction materials, utilizing the services of the Procurement&#13;
and Market Information Service Enterprise (PMISE), which has been established as an&#13;
autonomous state enterprise from the ERRP Central Procurement Cell. The Central&#13;
Office will also be responsible for procurement of some items through International&#13;
Shopping procedures. The Community Project Committees (CPC), as implementing&#13;
agency, will be responsible for local sub-project related procurement as stated in the&#13;
Financing Agreement signed with the Regional Office. The terms of this agreement will&#13;
need to comply with the provisions of the Operational Manual and the Credit Agreement.&#13;
The Agreement also specifies monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure that the&#13;
CPC complies with the procurement terms and conditions. The CPC's procurement&#13;
activities will be supervised, and assisted where needed by the Regional Office.&#13;
3.75  The Central Office will monitor all local procurement activities, through the&#13;
Procurement Unit of its Financial and Administrative Department, strengthened by the&#13;
recruitment of an additional Senior Procurement Officer and two Junior Procurement&#13;
Officers. Each Regional Office will have two Procurement Officers to assist Project&#13;
Officers determine and supervise procurement arrangements in line with the Operational&#13;
Manual, and to monitor and assist CPCs. Procurement training will be provided for Fund&#13;
staff, CPCs, and other agencies involved in ESRDF-associated procurement.&#13;
3.76 Procurement Schedule. Actual procurement requirements will be determined by&#13;
the pipeline of appraised and financed community-based sub-projects. The Procurement&#13;
Schedule (Table IO), and the Procurement Arrangements (Table 11) are estimates based&#13;
on Project Cost Projections. The Procurement plan, shown as Annex L, reflects the&#13;
standard procurement processing time for all goods and materials to be procured by the&#13;
Central Office through ICB. From the second year onwards, Regional offices will&#13;
provide similar procurement plans as part of their Annual Work Program and Budget.&#13;
3.77  Procurement Arrangements. Procurement of goods or construction materials&#13;
costing more than US$ 100,000 (machinery necessary to implement sub-projects as well&#13;
as vehicles and equipment for ESRDF offices and the WMU) will be undertaken through&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with World Bank Procurement&#13;
Guidelines for all procurement financed or managed by IDA. This is expected to amount&#13;
to US$ 16.74 million and will be coordinated by the Central Office for the ESRDF share,&#13;
and by the WMU for its share. Annex L provides a list of items that will be imported.&#13;
Before credit effectiveness, the Government will have finalized standard bidding&#13;
documents for goods, works and consulting services based on the Bank's standard&#13;
bidding and contract documents.&#13;

3.78 The Financing Agreement signed between ESRDF and implementing agencies&#13;
(IAs) will specify procurement arrangements for each sub-project which will be&#13;
consistent with guidelines provided herein and recorded in the Operational Manual.&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB), with procedures and documents satisfactory to&#13;
IDA, will be required for all contracts for civil works below US$ 500,000, and purchase&#13;
of goods/materials below US$ 1 00,000 with the following exceptions.&#13;
3.79 In remote areas, IAs may procure goods through competitive National Shopping&#13;
by obtaining at least three bids, for contracts estimated to cost US$ 50,000 equivalent or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
less per contract, up to an aggregate IDA total not exceeding US$ 6 million. Works&#13;
estimated to cost US$ 100,000 or less per contract, shall be procured under lump sum&#13;
fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations, obtained from three domestic&#13;
contractors in response to a written invitation, up to an aggregate of US$ 15 million.&#13;
3.80  In order to increase community ownership and sustainability of sub-project&#13;
activity, the Project encourages communities to implement sub-projects themselves. In&#13;
such community self-help projects, the CPC will implement the works, contracting labor&#13;
directly from the community, and purchasing goods and materials as stated in its&#13;
Financing Agreement. ESRDF will ensure in such cases, that the CPC is provided with&#13;
or hires requisite technical consultants to supervise implementation. Such self-help&#13;
projects will be contracted by the ESRDF, subject to provisions in the Operational&#13;
Manual, with IDA financing up to US$ 15 million. Out of this US$ 15 million, an&#13;
estimated US$ 8 million in goods and construction materials will be procured through&#13;
competitive national shopping as stated above in para 3. 79. In cases where no bids are&#13;
received, they may be procured through direct contracting, up to a total aggregate of US$&#13;
1 million. Works estimated to cost US $ 50,000 equivalent or less per contract, up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$ 6 million, will be procured through procedures stated in the Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
3.81  Consultant Service Contracts will be awarded in accordance with World Bank&#13;
Guidelines, "Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency" (Washington D.C., August 1981) as detailed in the Operational&#13;
Manual. Both the Central and Regional Offices will contract consultants to provide&#13;
technical assistance and capacity building. Many of these will be small contracts for&#13;
training ESRDF staff, local government, and NGO staff; or for promotional activity.&#13;
ESRDF will also have a Study Fund for conducting studies related to ESRDF activities.&#13;
These contracts are expected to total US$ 13.14 million (IDA US$ 4. 78 million) over five&#13;
years, and a substantial proportion of this will be procured locally. Regional Offices and&#13;
implementing agencies will be permitted to hire consultants to conduct requisite technical&#13;
studies, supervise implementation, or provide other services permitted in the sub-project&#13;
Financing Agreement. The cost of these contracts will be part of the sub-project costs.&#13;
3.82 For the Welfare Monitoring Component, all procurement with IDA funds (US$&#13;
0.81 million) will be subject to the principles stated above. Vehicles and equipment will&#13;
be procured through ICB (see Table 11, item 6). A significant portion of IDA funds will&#13;
go towards technical assistance and consulting services procured as described in the&#13;
previous paragraph.&#13;
3.83  Equipment For Sub-Project Implementation. The appraisal verified that there&#13;
are remote communities in a number of areas where there is a lack of contractors with&#13;
access to equipment able to carry out civil works on competitive terms. This constraint&#13;
could especially limit ESRDF's capacity to respond to demands from such communities&#13;
for small-scale irrigation and water supply sub-projects which will require equipment-&#13;
based civil works. The situation is likely to evolve over the project period as more&#13;
contractors emerge as a result of general and regional economic growth and development.&#13;
At the outset, IDA will respond to this need by providing a limited selection of equipment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
to the ESRDF to be available for commercial leasing to contractors who otherwise&#13;
qualify for such assignments. Although ownership and responsibility for such equipment&#13;
will remain with the ESRDF, the management of leasing and maintaining this equipment&#13;
will be sub-contracted to competent agencies. When the private sector has developed,&#13;
such sub-contracting will be procured on a competitive basis. However, at the outset,&#13;
IDA will agree to allow the contract to be established with a regional bureau or other&#13;
public agency as long as (i) the competence of such an agency has been appraised; (ii) the&#13;
contract is for a limited period, not to exceed two years; and (iii) the cost to a contractor&#13;
to the ESRDF of leasing such equipment shall not be eligible for IDA financing.&#13;
Procedures for dealing with such contracts are contained in the Operational Manual.&#13;
3.84 The initial provision of equipment will be for an amount not to exceed US$ 11.58&#13;
million, based on projections of sub-project needs in equipment-intensive sub-sectors.&#13;
Independent performance reviews of the arrangements will be carried out by qualified&#13;
technical specialists. A first review will be conducted at the end of the first year, and a&#13;
second in time to ensure review and definition of subsequent arrangements during the&#13;
mid-term review. The reviews will ensure that the equipment is being effectively&#13;
maintained and utilized; that leasing is being carried out on a fair and commercial basis;&#13;
that implementation is benefiting from this arrangement; and account is being taken of&#13;
any significant changes in the private sector's capacity either to take over the&#13;
maintenance and leasing arrangement, or to provide equipment-based civil works on&#13;
competitive terms. During the mid-term review, ESRDF and the Bank will assess the&#13;
need to continue or modify such arrangements. In the event that the need has increased&#13;
without an adequate supply response from the private sector, the Bank may consider an&#13;
additional limited provision of equipment on similar or modified terms. Full details of&#13;
the procedures to be followed are contained in the Operational Manual.&#13;
3.85  Procurement Reviews and Assessments. Prior review, combined with financial&#13;
audits and procurement assessments, will ensure that procurement complies with agreed&#13;
procedures. All ICB contracts and all other contracts above US$ 100,000 will be subject&#13;
to Bank prior review. In addition, the first five contracts from each region will be subject&#13;
to prior review. All competitive contracts for consultancy and training services, costing&#13;
the equivalent of US$ 50,000 or more for consulting firms, and US$ 25,000 or more for&#13;
individuals, will require Bank prior review, as will all single source consultancy or&#13;
training contracts regardless of their value. The ESRDF Central Office will provide Bank&#13;
supervision missions with all documentation for a sample of sub-projects subject to post&#13;
review, selected by the Bank team during the mission. The Central Office will also have&#13;
available for supervision missions copies of appraisal reports for all sub-projects above&#13;
US$ 100,000.&#13;
3.86 The ESRDF Annual Review will evaluate the effectiveness of procurement by&#13;
and on behalf of communities. At the end of the first 18 months, under terms of reference&#13;
agreed with IDA, ESRDF will contract independent consultants, to assess the economy&#13;
and efficiency of community managed procurement, and the technical quality of&#13;
infrastructure sub-projects. This review will determine the need for modifications to the&#13;
procurement arrangements, revisions to the profile of infrastructure sub-projects eligible&#13;
for financing under the Project, and the need for further studies of a similar nature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
3.87  Unit Costs Database. ESRDF will collect and maintain at the Central and&#13;
Regional levels, an up-to-date data base of unit costs, commonly required for project&#13;
implementation. Unit prices of individual items included in the works will be used to&#13;
derive the total cost of the works. The data base will be used in appraisal and monitoring&#13;
as a tool to review the project budget in the Financing Agreement and as a guide when&#13;
procurement is through direct contracting.&#13;

3.88  It is estimated that the proposed IDA Credit of US $120 million will be disbursed&#13;
over a period of five years, in accordance with Table 12 above. The project will use&#13;
flexible disbursements mechanisms, being piloted in the Bank, consisting of a Simplified&#13;
Special Account Procedure which allows decentralized management of sub-projects.&#13;
Initial training has already been provided to ESRDF staff on the requirements of these&#13;
disbursement mechanisms. The process will also help simplify the administration of&#13;
funds in various currencies coming from several co-financiers. Based on the approved&#13;
Annual Plan and Budget, Regional Offices will, as stipulated in the Operational Manual,&#13;
prepare and submit to the Central Office summary statements of expense, where they will&#13;
be consolidated as the basis for the preparation of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) in&#13;
support of Applications for Replenishment of the Special Account, submitted to IDA at&#13;
agreed regular intervals. The Government's share of the Project cost will be identified&#13;
separately. The statements of expense will also identify and quantify items of&#13;
expenditure to be centrally procured for reasons of economy and efficiency. The Welfare&#13;
Monitoring Unit will utilize the normal SOE procedure.&#13;
3.89  Special Accounts (SAs) and Local Accounts. To expedite disbursements, the&#13;
Government will open three SAs with the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (or any other&#13;
bank acceptable to IDA), one (US$ 9 million) operated by the Central Office of the&#13;
ESRDF, and one (US$ 100,000) by the Welfare Monitoring Unit and one (US$ 100,000)&#13;
by the Central Statistical Authority for the Welfare Monitoring component. The Central&#13;
Office will open another account in local currency into which the Government&#13;
contribution will be deposited for local currency expenditures and operational costs not&#13;
financed by IDA. The Government's deposit into a local account offunds equivalent to&#13;
its share of the first year of Project costs (based on the agreedfirst year 's plan and&#13;
budget), is a condition for credit effectiveness.8 On credit effectiveness, the Central&#13;
Office, the Welfare Monitoring Unit, and the Central Statistical Authority will each&#13;
submit a withdrawal application for an initial deposit to the Special Account, drawn from&#13;
8 This figure will take account of the amount that the Government has already contributed to the&#13;
establishment of the ESRDF operating structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
the IDA Credit and the grants administered by the Bank for other donors to the Project,&#13;
for an amount estimated at four months of disbursements. Replenishment of funds from&#13;
IDA to the SA will be made on evidence of satisfactory utilization of the previous&#13;
advance, reflected in the SOEs prepared by the Central Office, and SOEs prepared by the&#13;
Welfare Monitoring Unit. Replenishment will also depend on whether Regional Offices&#13;
are current in providing MIS data and reports. Withdrawal applications for direct&#13;
payment and special commitments will be no less than US$ 1 00,000. The total budget&#13;
for all centrally managed items will be retained in the SA under the financial management&#13;
of the Central Office. Each Regional Office will open two local accounts, one for&#13;
funding sub-projects and one for administrative expenses. The Central Office will make&#13;
an initial advance into each account to cover four months of estimated expenditures,&#13;
based on the annual work program submitted by Regional Offices. All documentation&#13;
supporting ESRDF and Welfare Monitoring SOEs will be made available at the Central&#13;
Office and the Welfare Monitoring Unit, for inspection by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
During the Project launch workshop, specialized training will be provided to ESRDF staff&#13;
on the requirements of the Simplified Special Account procedures.&#13;
3.90   Project Preparation Facility. An advance from the Project Preparation Facility&#13;
equal to the amount of US$ I million has been approved to finance start-up costs of&#13;
launching the project.&#13;

5. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.91   Accounting. For the ESRDF, the accounting system used for the pilot phase is&#13;
being improved to (i) accommodate a significantly expanded size of the program; (ii)&#13;
reflect the central and decentralized levels of financial accountability, operating as a self-&#13;
contained system within Regional Offices, and as a consolidated system at the Central&#13;
Office; and (iii) link effectively with the Management Information System developed for&#13;
the expanded phase. Initially, regional accounting data will be transmitted monthly on&#13;
diskettes to the Central Office where it will be consolidated; but it is hoped that&#13;
telecommunications improvements will allow Central Office direct access to regional&#13;
accounting data. Consolidated Financial Statements will be produced on a quarterly&#13;
basis, and the Management Information System will include more regular (monthly)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
monitoring by Central Office of essential cash and banking data linked to operations.&#13;
The Central Office's pilot Financial and Administrative Department (FAD) will be&#13;
expanded to include a number of skilled staff to handle the increased financial&#13;
responsibilities and accounting requirements. Each Regional Office will have an&#13;
Administrative and Accounting Department. The Welfare Monitoring Unit and the&#13;
Central Statistical Authority will maintain their respective separate accounting system for&#13;
the Welfare Monitoring Component.&#13;
3.92 Auditing. The annual financial statements of ESRDF, the WMU and the CSA&#13;
will be audited in accordance with International Standards of Auditing by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA. Additionally, in each region internal regional auditors&#13;
reporting to the Chair of the Regional Steering Committee, will audit the ESRDF&#13;
financial statements and physical activities of Regional Offices, and submit audit reports&#13;
to the Central Office, for review by the ESRDF Board, which can authorize the removal&#13;
of internal auditors. ESRDF will submit to IDA copies of various reports and audits&#13;
submitted to the Board.&#13;
6. Monitoring, Reporting and Supervision&#13;
3.93  Principles of Monitoring. The monitoring cycle will contain a number of steps.&#13;
The communities' identification of their own needs and priorities during the promotion&#13;
stage, will represent the base-line for monitoring the future impact of ESRDF-financed&#13;
interventions. ESRDF project staff will make field trips to track progress, and will record&#13;
information based on defined indicators on (i) the progress of implementation; (ii) the&#13;
quality of completed sub-projects; and (iii) the benefit to communities and the&#13;
sustainability of facilities created with ESRDF financing. Monitoring sustainability will&#13;
be specially important where communities submit a number of proposals to be&#13;
implemented in sequence. All monitoring and evaluation will gather both quantitative&#13;
and qualitative information, and use participatory methods, encouraging communities to&#13;
assess progress and results in terms relevant to them.&#13;
3.94 Project Monitoring Information System. ESRDF's Project Monitoring&#13;
Information System (MIS) has three purposes. Thefirst is to track implementation and&#13;
disbursement progress on an on-going basis, to facilitate the preparation of Semi-Annual&#13;
and Progress Reports. The second is to enable the Central Office to carry out special&#13;
studies and analyses related to ESRDF operations. The third is to enable the Central&#13;
Office to assess the outcome of the ESRDF Project against an agreed list of Performance&#13;
Indicators (see Annex D). Given that the ESRDF is not a blueprint project, targets for the&#13;
performance indicators will be established annually on the basis of the previous year's&#13;
performance, rather than at the beginning for the entire lifespan of the project. The&#13;
monitoring of the indicators will be an important component of the annual review&#13;
process. In addition to helping prepare reports for the ESRDF Board, this monitoring will&#13;
assist Bank supervision missions, the Mid-Term Review, the production of the&#13;
Implementation Completion Report, and specially designed evaluation and research&#13;
studies, including any commissioned under the Welfare Monitoring System. The Project&#13;
MIS will contain computerized data updated and forwarded by the Regional Offices. The&#13;
system (whose main components are summarized in Annex D) will enable ESRDF to (i)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
identify the achievements of the ESRDF; (ii) keep track of proposals received and&#13;
approved and their progress through the implementation cycle; (iii) analyze the sector&#13;
content and evolution of the portfolio; (iv) ensure that all the sectoral requirements&#13;
specified in the Operational Manual are being followed; (v) analyze unit costs based on a&#13;
range of criteria; (vi) analyze the efficiency of ESRDF operations; (vii) analyze the main&#13;
patterns of procurement; (viii) analyze the participation of communities, women, and&#13;
other groups; (ix) analyze environmental factors; and (x) maintain budget control. The&#13;
MIS will be integrated with the accounting system to facilitate the production of financial&#13;
and performance based reports. The establishment of accounting and management&#13;
systems for Project implementation, acceptable to IDA, is a requirement for Credit&#13;
Effectiveness. If the ESRDF computerized Accounting and MIS system in any Regional&#13;
Office is not operational before disbursement begins, the manual system already&#13;
approved will be used until computerized, and the Central Office will ensure that this&#13;
manually captured accounting and MIS information will be transferred to the&#13;
computerized system.&#13;
3.95  Regular Reporting. Regional Offices will prepare and submit to the Regional&#13;
Steering Committees and ESRDF Central Office, Semi-Annual Progress Reports, which&#13;
will provide details implementation progress (physically, financially, and in terms of&#13;
implementation management) based on implementation goals and timetable. The Central&#13;
Office will prepare for submission to ESRDF Board, a Consolidated Semi-Annual Report,&#13;
within six weeks of the end of each half-year, summarizing overall implementation and&#13;
disbursement progress, highlighting any specific problems that require Board attention,&#13;
and proposing actions to correct these problems. The Annual Report (AR) will cover&#13;
results for the whole year. Progress will be measured against the previous year's Annual&#13;
Work Plan and Budget (AWPB), and the AR will provide the basis on which the&#13;
forthcoming AWPB will be prepared. The AR will include the annual project financial&#13;
and performance audits. Formats for these reports are contained in the Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
3.96 Sub-Project Completion Reports. A short report will be written on the&#13;
completion of each sub-project by the responsible ESRDF Project Officer in consultation&#13;
with the beneficiaries, implementing agency, facilitators, and regional bureau staff. The&#13;
report will include (i) a summary of the physical achievements and outcomes based on&#13;
agreed sub-project goals; (ii) a statement of the benefits as seen at this stage; (iii) a&#13;
description of specific problems encountered and actions taken to remedy them; (iv) a&#13;
summary of the sub-project accounts; and (v) a description of the follow-up steps,&#13;
including maintenance arrangements and responsibilities, and linkages with other&#13;
activities both current and planned. Copies of all Sub-Project Completion Reports will be&#13;
submitted to Regional Sub-Committees and ESRDF Central Office.&#13;
3.97 Bank/Donor Supervision. The Bank will supervise the Project through a&#13;
headquarters- based task manager who will carry overall responsibility for&#13;
implementation and leading supervision missions. There will be two supervision&#13;
missions each year consisting of a small team of sector specialists and donor&#13;
representatives. The missions will study the implementation records, accounts and&#13;
audits, and MIS data retained by the Central Office, and make sample visits to Regional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
Offices, selected project sites, and participating communities. One of these missions will&#13;
coincide with the ESRDF annual planning cycle, and will review the Annual Work Plan&#13;
and Budget and the previous Annual Review. In addition to these regular supervision&#13;
missions, there will be the independent consultant review at the end of the first 18 months&#13;
to assess the economy and efficiency of community managed procurement, and the&#13;
technical quality of infrastructure sub-projects; the Project Mid-Term Review, and on-&#13;
going liaison with the Central Office on their research program into beneficiary impact.&#13;
7. Mid-Term Review and Project Evaluation&#13;
3.98 Mid-Term Review. The mid-term review will take place after 30 months of&#13;
project implementation to identify project successes and problems to be addressed, and&#13;
modifications that may be needed in project procedures for the second half of the Project.&#13;
The mid-term review will include independent consultant studies of a sample of sub-&#13;
projects by region and sector, using beneficiary participatory assessment methods.&#13;
3.99  Project Evaluation. A year before the completion of the Project, an independent&#13;
evaluation will be carried out to assess (i) whether the Project has accomplished its&#13;
project objectives and contribution to the broader poverty reduction program; (ii) the&#13;
effectiveness of ESRDF project management, the institutional structure, and the&#13;
operational procedures; and (iii) the value of the ESRDF as a development mechanism&#13;
for poverty reduction.&#13;
4. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
4.1   Before Credit Effectiveness, the Government will have:&#13;

National Poverty Reduction Strategy&#13;
A.    Introduction&#13;
I.     The reduction of poverty is a central goal of the Government's Economic Development&#13;
Strategy for Ethiopia. The roots of Ethiopia's extensive poverty are deep and complex, and&#13;
reducing poverty will require a range of mutually reinforcing measures at a number of different&#13;
levels. Shaping out this strategy depend, therefore, on a sound understanding of the nature and&#13;
causes of poverty in Ethiopia.&#13;
2.     Although poverty in Ethiopia takes many forms, it is important to differentiate between&#13;
transitory poverty and chronic poverty. Transitory poverty is the result of the dislocation caused&#13;
by years of protracted war and policy actions by the previous regime, that resulted in&#13;
displacement and separation of hundreds of thousands of people from their social and economic&#13;
sources of support. In this category there are refugees returning from the bordering countries to&#13;
which they fled to escape war and persecution, families uprooted by the previous government's&#13;
forced resettlement policies, people displaced as a result of losing their means of livelihood&#13;
(especially rural populations that fled to the cities), demobilized former soldiers, workers&#13;
retrenched from overstaffed public agencies, orphans and the disabled. Special, targeted&#13;
programs will help reintegrate many of these transitory poor back into community settings and a&#13;
means of economic and social support. Some proportion will fail to reintegrate and will swell the&#13;
numbers of the chronically poor.&#13;
3.    It is estimated that well over half of the population of Ethiopia are chronically poor, and&#13;
millions of others are vulnerable, through shocks such as droughts and environmental damage, to&#13;
joining the chronically poor. Although this form of poverty exists in urban areas, the cities have&#13;
borne the brunt of transitory poverty problems, and chronic poverty is chiefly a rural&#13;
phenomenon in Ethiopia, and especially severe in some parts of the country. From a macro-&#13;
economic viewpoint, chronic poverty in Ethiopia is fairly readily understandable. Due to a&#13;
combination of misconceived policies, massive wastage of national resources diverted into war,&#13;
significant neglect of some regions of the country, and recurring climatic disasters, the Ethiopian&#13;
economy has stagnated and declined at the same time that the population has been increasing at&#13;
about three percent a year.&#13;
4.     The results of this general economic situation can be seen in the poorly developed and&#13;
neglected state of the country's essential infrastructure, the lack of basic social services and&#13;
access to safe water, some of the worst health indicators (in terms of child and maternal&#13;
mortality, disease, and malnutrition) in Africa, and severe and increasing environmental&#13;
degradation in areas where population pressure has taken its toll on limited land resources. About&#13;
85 percent of the population earn their living from agricultural activities, but due to neglect of&#13;
the sector, the contribution of agriculture to GDP has declined from 65 percent in 1960 to about&#13;
42 percent today. Industry has also remained undeveloped offering employment to a more or less&#13;
static 5 percent of the population. In the last two decades, productive sources of growth were&#13;
squeezed out by an over-concentration of public sector spending on activities that did little to&#13;
contribute to economic development, and in reality squandered the resources of the country and&#13;
trapped the rural population in a chronic and deteriorating poverty spiral.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
B.    Main Elements of the Poverty Strategy&#13;
5.    It can be seen from the above that an effective poverty reduction strategy needs to be&#13;
constructed from a number of important elements. Firstly, with the end of the war, the return of&#13;
economic and civilian stability, the main causes of transitory poverty have been eliminated, and&#13;
conditions are favorable for actions to reverse the effects. The primary focus for action will be&#13;
the implementation of well-targeted programs that respond to the special needs and conditions of&#13;
various groups, aimed at helping these groups reintegrate with social support structures and&#13;
providing them with the means to achieve economic self-reliance. In some cases, the programs&#13;
need provide little more than access to credit or other resources, together with appropriate&#13;
training and technical support. In other cases, such as disabled victims of war, longer term&#13;
support structures may be needed. But wherever possible, the goal will be to assist both&#13;
communities and individuals to reduce or eliminate dependence on continuing state support.&#13;
Although fairly simple in conception, these programs are nevertheless expensive in terms of both&#13;
resources and capacity in a country gradually recovering from economic stagnation, and facing&#13;
huge social and economic rehabilitation costs.&#13;
6.     The strategy to reduce chronic poverty requires a more complex combination of&#13;
elements. As chronic poverty has its roots in an incapacity of the economy to meet the pressures&#13;
of population growth, the overall strategy will focus on both expanding the economy and&#13;
reducing the rate of population growth. Increased economic growth is at the heart of the&#13;
Government's economic development strategy, and will provide the basic, long-term sustainable&#13;
foundation for poverty reduction. Economic growth will not only provide an expansion of&#13;
employment and incomes, but will also respond to chronic poverty in two other important ways.&#13;
Firstly, it will reduce food insecurity, which is the most serious vulnerability for the chronically&#13;
poor. This will be accomplished both through an increase in domestic food production, and&#13;
through increased export earnings which can be used to pay food imports to cover any gaps in&#13;
domestic production. Secondly, economic growth will increase government revenues at the same&#13;
time as permitting increased devolution of economic responsibility from the public to the private&#13;
sector. The result will be a higher allocation of public resources for the basic social services and&#13;
infrastructure vital to improving the living conditions and economic prospects of the chronically&#13;
poor.&#13;
7.     Another important strategic element to reduce chronic poverty is the important poverty&#13;
characteristics of the different regions of the country. Although there are no parts of Ethiopia that&#13;
are free of significant poverty, there are some regions that were especially neglected, badly&#13;
affected by war, or prone to natural disaster. Particularly in Wello, Tigray, Hararghe, and&#13;
Gamgoffa, a large majority of households are classified as chronically poor or very vulnerable.&#13;
These are areas suffering from significant degradation of environmental resources, rural isolation&#13;
due to inadequacies of the road network, very poor social services and facilities, and limited&#13;
economic options. Even in the most badly afflicted regions, there are both the resources and&#13;
human potential for long-term development and reduction of poverty. However, unless these&#13;
regions receive special attention, and the resource transfers to build the basic infrastructure for&#13;
both productive activities and social service delivery, it is possible that they could be by-passed&#13;
by the wider benefits of economic growth. It is also essential that regions are assisted in building&#13;
the capacity to initiate and manage a development process relevant to their own specific needs,&#13;
and that this process is linked as closely as possible to the grass-roots through community&#13;
participation and ownership.&#13;

C.    Key Interventions in Poverty Reduction&#13;
8.     Based on the strategy described above, the Government's program of poverty reduction&#13;
is diverse but with interlinked interventions, each of which are complex and described in detail&#13;
in other documents, but which will be presented briefly here.&#13;
9.     Targeted Assistance Programs. There are now a large range of special targeted&#13;
assistance programs aimed at the needs of special groups who are suffering the consequences of&#13;
war, policy neglect, or the transitory effects of economic reform. At a summary level the most&#13;
important of these programs are:&#13;
(a) Rehabilitation Programs for Returning Refugees, providing both consumption and&#13;
production assistance to help 550,000 refugees from Somalia, Sudan, and Djibouti to&#13;
reintegrate into urban and rural communities.&#13;
(b) Program for Retrenched Public Sector Employees, which will provide retrenched&#13;
persons with compensatory payments, training for redeployment, and credit for income-&#13;
generating ventures.&#13;
(c) Rehabilitation Programs for Ex-Soldiers, providing just under 500,000 ex-soldiers with&#13;
both temporary food assistance and access to a revolving fund to purchase productive&#13;
assets, to assist their reintegration into urban and rural life.&#13;
(d) Consumption Assistance Program for Socially Disadvantaged Groups, responding to the&#13;
needs of about 25,000 households made up of the elderly, disabled, and orphans.&#13;
(e) Production Assistance for the Poorest of Poor Rural Households, providing cash&#13;
assistance to about 160,000 poor rural households to purchase inputs such as fertilizer,&#13;
seeds, handtools, and veterinary drugs.&#13;
(f) Public Works Programs, which will be put into effect in 15 cities where the urban poor&#13;
are concentrated, and which, in collaboration with local communities, will concentrate&#13;
on agricultural and infrastructure assets that will reduce vulnerability to natural disasters&#13;
and provide economic opportunities. These programs are supplemented by food/cash-&#13;
for-work programs in areas such as soil conservation, irrigation, and dam construction.&#13;
(g) Rehabilitation Assistance for Displaced People, providing essential agricultural inputs to&#13;
assist over 150,000 displaced persons to take up farming activities in Tigray, Amhara,&#13;
Oromiya, and Southern Ethiopia.&#13;
(h) Emergency Projects, over 60 projects supported by World Food Program aimed at small-&#13;
holder and cooperative dairy production, upgrading of farming practices, increasing&#13;
school enrollments in drought and war affected areas, and providing employment to&#13;
food-insecure rural households.&#13;

10.   Reducing Population Growth. While reducing population growth rate is a complex&#13;
and long-term prospect, it is also an essential requirement for the utility of many of the other&#13;
poverty reduction actions that will be taken. Unless the growth in population can be managed,&#13;
the benefits of economic growth will not be effectively captured, the task of improving basic&#13;
social service delivery will not be feasible, and the goal of sustainable environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
conservation will become unattainable. Rapid population growth has not only placed basic&#13;
services and natural resources under great strain, but also dramatically altered the demographic&#13;
profile of the country increasing the proportion of unemployment among the young and wasting&#13;
the productive resources of the nation. High fertility rates combined with high rates of infant&#13;
mortality and infant disease places an inordinate strain on poor women and reduces their&#13;
opportunity to play a productive role in economic activities. Managing population growth will&#13;
become even more urgent as the improvements in primary health care result in lower mother and&#13;
child mortality rates and an increase in life expectancy.&#13;
11.    The Government has therefore adopted a population policy which has set goals for&#13;
reductions in the current high rates of fertility from an average of 7.7 children per woman to an&#13;
average of about 4 children per woman by 2015. This goal will be achieved through a&#13;
combination of measures including a significant increase in contraceptive use; reductions in&#13;
maternal, infant, and child mortality; increase in female educational enrollments, removal of&#13;
legal and customary constraints on women's economic and social activities; and the launching of&#13;
a nationwide population education and information program to promote the importance of&#13;
smaller families, and the link between family size, human welfare, and environmental security.&#13;
These approaches form the basis for a program which will be accompanied by improved&#13;
research, data collection, analysis, and dissemination regarding population trends and issues. To&#13;
design and implement this multi-disciplinary approach to population management, and to ensure&#13;
the integration of mainstream population management initiatives with efforts to promote&#13;
improved income-earning opportunities in the various productive sectors, a National Population&#13;
Council has been established made up of a number of sector ministers and heads of relevant&#13;
agencies, each of whose organizations will have specific implementation responsibilities in the&#13;
population program. This national body will be supported by a structure of population councils at&#13;
the regional and zonal levels, and committees at the woreda level.&#13;
12.    Stimulating Economic Growth. Employment generating economic growth will be the&#13;
most important foundation for long-term sustainable reduction of chronic poverty in Ethiopia.&#13;
The program to stimulate economic growth has four key elements. The first is the maintenance&#13;
of macro-economics stability through prudent fiscal and monetary management. Much has&#13;
already been achieved in this respect, and it is the goal of this program to ensure that the budget&#13;
deficit is carefully managed and progressively reduced, along with domestic bank financing of&#13;
the deficit; that inflation is kept under control; that the foreign exchange rate is kept competitive&#13;
based on market provision of foreign exchange; and that real positive interest rates are&#13;
maintained to stimulate savings. The second is to stimulate production to generate employment,&#13;
increase domestic production of food and other essential commodities, and increase exports. The&#13;
Government has adopted a strategy of agricultural-development-led industrialization (ADLI),&#13;
which responds to the current limitations of the agricultural sector and its key role in the&#13;
economy. The goal of this policy is a parallel emphasis on three sources of growth and&#13;
employment. The first is to increase output from the agriculture sector through improvement of&#13;
productivity in small-holdings and expansion of large-scale farms, especially in the lowlands.&#13;
The second is to significantly increase the productivity of the industrial and service sectors, in&#13;
recognition of the limitations of the agricultural sector in providing employment for Ethiopia's&#13;
rapidly increasing population. The third is to increase the production of minerals to add diversity&#13;
to Ethiopia's exports.&#13;
13.   The third key element in stimulating economic growth is to encourage investment by&#13;
stimulating the growth of the private sector, streamlining licensing, export, and import processes,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
rationalizing and divesting state enterprises, ensuring the availability of foreign exchange, and&#13;
liberalizing the financial sector to provide a wider range of investment and international banking&#13;
services. Finally, underpinning both the stimulation of production and encouragement of&#13;
investment, the program to increase economic growth will require significant selective&#13;
investment in infrastructure, services, and resource management. In terms of infrastructure the&#13;
key priorities are road improvement and maintenance, and expansion of electricity supply. In&#13;
terms of services, priorities include agricultural extension and research, and the provision of&#13;
improved rural credit. Finally, expansion of agricultural production and an increase in mining&#13;
activities will require emphasis on a number of aspects of environmental rehabilitation and&#13;
conservation.&#13;
14.   Provision of Improved Social Services. Another key aspect of the poverty reduction&#13;
program is the expansion and improvement in quality of basic social services which will have a&#13;
critical impact not only on the quality of life for the chronic poor, but also improve their access&#13;
to economic opportunities and contribute to their productivity. The Government has made&#13;
significant reallocations of budgetary resources for the social services, increasing spending since&#13;
FY89 from 12 to 24 percent of the total budget. The largest proportion of these increases are&#13;
going to basic services, primary education (which is now receiving 47 percent of the education&#13;
budget), and primary rural health care (for which the allocation within the health budget has&#13;
almost doubled since FY89). Within the education and health programs, emphasis will be given&#13;
to a number of factors directly related to poverty reduction. In education this includes improving&#13;
the participation of girls, improving female literacy, correcting regional imbalances, and&#13;
improving the incentives for primary enrollments by utilizing local languages. Within the health&#13;
sector, special emphasis is being given to expansion of maternal and child health, the control of&#13;
communicable diseases, nutrition programs, and complementary measures to improve access to&#13;
safe water and sanitation.&#13;
15.    Focus on Regional and Community Development. The final important aspect of the&#13;
poverty reduction process is the emphasis on regional and community development. As indicated&#13;
earlier in this paper, while there are few parts of Ethiopia that do not suffer from chronic poverty,&#13;
there is a concentration of especially poor and vulnerable households in certain regions of the&#13;
country that have experienced extensive war destruction, the displacement of their populations,&#13;
policy neglect, and climatic and environmental damage. Ethiopia has launched a far-reaching&#13;
process of regional devolution, which will facilitate economic and social development and the&#13;
reduction of chronic poverty. By taking responsibility for managing the development process,&#13;
regional administrations can ensure that the special needs and conditions of the regions are taken&#13;
into account in the development planning process. There are a number of ways in which this&#13;
trend can contribute to poverty reduction: fostering the participation and ownership of&#13;
communities (including community cost-sharing, appropriate cost recovery mechanisms, and&#13;
improved community maintenance of assets); encouraging the use of labor-intensive methods,&#13;
appropriate technologies, and local resources; and improving the efficiency of implementation&#13;
by removing central bottlenecks, expanding technical and managerial capacity within the&#13;
regions, and encouraging the growth of local private sector contractors. The Government has&#13;
already ensured that regions with special rehabilitation and development needs receive the&#13;
necessary resources, and has launched a far-reaching program to train officials and other&#13;
facilitators of the development process. The next step will be to prepare in-depth regional&#13;
development plans that respond both to the special needs and poverty profile of the regions, but&#13;
also exploit the natural assets and resources the regions provide.&#13;
&#13;

D.    Contribution of the ESRDF&#13;
16.    The Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund (ESRDF) is an important&#13;
component of the poverty reduction strategy and program described above. While the main focus&#13;
of the ESRDF is to contribute to the reduction of chronic poverty, it will also be of benefit to&#13;
special targeted groups, especially poor women. The special contribution of the ESRDF will take&#13;
a number of forms. Firstly, the program is aimed at building community self-reliance by&#13;
providing poor communities in rural areas with economic assets critical to improved incomes,&#13;
social assets vital to improving the quality of life and productive potential, and knowledge,&#13;
skills, and experience in managing their own development. Secondly, while the program will&#13;
respond to any community initiative that is feasible, sustainable, and truly developmental, it will&#13;
give special focus to sectors that have been identified as vital in the strategy to reduce chronic&#13;
poverty: namely, rural water supply and conservation, small-scale irrigation, primary health&#13;
facilities and services, basic education facilities and services, and micro-enterprise development&#13;
through support for small-scale income-generation initiatives. In addition, by taking an activist&#13;
role in promoting development practices among communities, the ESRDF can also make a&#13;
positive impact on environmental practices, nutrition standards, family planning, energy savings,&#13;
and a number of other interventions of great importance to poverty reduction. The ESRDF will&#13;
also be an important method of piloting and experimenting with approaches to community-based&#13;
development, helping to integrate sectoral interventions in mutually reinforcing ways. The&#13;
program will also provide an opportunity to test new institutional mechanisms at a local level,&#13;
especially the strengthening of traditional savings organizations and service cooperatives to&#13;
provide micro-credit and small-scale banking services to communities currently beyond the&#13;
reach of the financial sector Finally, the ESRDF will make an important contribution to building&#13;
capacities and skills at the regional level, and in this way helping to strengthen the&#13;
responsiveness of regional administrations to community-based participative development and&#13;
the utilization of labor-intensive approaches.&#13;
17.   The project to support the expanded ESRDF will contain a component to support the&#13;
establishment of a poverty monitoring system for Ethiopia. This component will contribute an&#13;
invaluable and indispensable tool for poverty reduction, enabling policy makers to track the&#13;
impact on poverty levels of both broadly conceived economic reform measures, as well as&#13;
specific targeted programs and interventions. The poverty monitoring system will be especially&#13;
important in establishing a reliable information base on the sources and nature of poverty in&#13;
different regions of the country, and provide the foundation for the design and monitoring of&#13;
regional development programs with a poverty reduction focus.&#13;

Sub-Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
I.      Monitoring and evaluation are two elements of the ESRDF Management Information&#13;
System, which will provide managers of the Fund with access to physical and financial&#13;
information about the progress of sub-project activities and the financial commitments and&#13;
expenditure of the Fund. The MIS will be used to track sub-projects, Local Financial&#13;
Intermediaries, and the overall operational efficiency of the ESRDF.&#13;

3.     Appraisal to Completion.. Information will be formulated by the concerned PO&#13;
assigned to follow the implementation of the sub-project in question. For a construction sub-&#13;
project executed by an implementing agency where there is no additional technical supervisor, a&#13;
review on site will be necessary at least once a week by the implementing agency and&#13;
representatives of the Sub-Project committee. Where there is a technical supervisor, he or she&#13;
will undertake the tasks detailed above, and the review by the implementing agency/Sub-Project&#13;
committee will be every 2 weeks. A monthly report will be submitted by the implementing&#13;
agencies to the RO and the relevant data will be entered into the MIS by each Regional Office,&#13;
and detailed tables of analysis will be generated each month and retained for the use of the&#13;
Regional Office. A printed summary of the analysis, together with updated computer files from&#13;
the MIS will be forwarded to the Central Unit each month. The format for the MPR is contained&#13;
in the Operational Manual.&#13;
4.     Post Completion Monitoring and Follow-Up. All projects will be visited at least once,&#13;
when a settled pattern of utilization has become established so that important features of&#13;
sustainability such as maintenance and participatory management can be assessed. Information&#13;
will be collected using the technical checklist developed for the relevant sector, contained in the&#13;
technical handbooks. All sub-project post completion monitoring will include participative&#13;
community-based methods of record-keeping for post-project management.&#13;
5.     A Micro-project Completion Report (MCR) will be the final report of the sub-project.&#13;
The PO is responsible for completing the MCR after discussion with representatives of the&#13;
beneficiaries/Sub-Project Committee, the implementing agency, the local government sector&#13;
authority, the contractor, and the supervisor. Copies of the MCR on recently completed sub-&#13;
projects are forwarded for information to members of the Regional Steering Committee, and&#13;
after their consideration, to the Central Office, where the results of all MCRs are incorporated in&#13;
reports to the National Board.&#13;
6.    Impact Assessment. A sample of completed sub-projects will be selected for a formal&#13;
impact assessment. The sample will reflect the sectoral and regional distribution of sub-projects,&#13;
with special attention to sub- projects which are technically innovative; which have&#13;
implementation periods in excess of nine months; and which cost more than Birr I million.&#13;
Impact assessments will be undertaken after sufficient time has elapsed for economic or social&#13;
change to have taken place, generally not less than one year after completion of project activities.&#13;
The Fund will contract not less than one set of impact studies every year, the results of which&#13;
will be presented to the National Board. Impact studies will use a participative approach, with&#13;
both structured and open-ended enquiry mechanisms, and both individual and group interviews.&#13;
The studies will also draw on sub-project reports and participatory monitoring. The focus of the&#13;
studies will be the change in economic and social welfare of sub-project beneficiaries as a result&#13;
of the sub-project construction and operation. Comparisons will be made with the information&#13;
collected during appraisal and from socio-economic baseline surveys where they exist. Special&#13;
emphasis would be placed on gender issues, the environment, sustainability, and links with other&#13;
relevant initiatives.&#13;
B. Monitoring ESRDF Operational Efficiency&#13;
7.     The MIS will also track a limited number of indicators related to the overall efficiency of&#13;
ESRDF operations. These will include elapsed time in completing each sub-project cycle phase,&#13;
and the recording and monitoring of overhead costs and personnel.&#13;

Based on the PO's report, the RO will be responsible for submitting to the CO monthly&#13;
summaries of regional accounts and physical activities. The main report which will bring this&#13;
together and monitor and track micro-project implementation is the MPR. The format is&#13;
contained in the MIS Handbook.&#13;
9.    Semi-Annual Report. The Semi-Annual Report monitors the progress of the overall&#13;
ESRDF program. The essential components of this report will be: (i) progress report for the half-&#13;
year with reference to annual plan; (ii) summary, by Regional Office of sub-projects under&#13;
preparation since the previous report; (iii) summary of sub-projects under implementation, with&#13;
date contracts signed, expected duration, and comments on any problems incurred; (iv) summary&#13;
of sub-projects completed since the previous report, dates contracts signed, expected duration,&#13;
actual duration, amount requested, actual expenditure, results and problems incurred; (v)&#13;
summary of impact assessments completed since the previous report with a synopsis of the&#13;
findings; (vi) Finance and Administration Officer's report for the half-year with reference to&#13;

D. Annual Work Program &amp; Budget, and Annual Report&#13;
10.   The Central Office will be responsible for producing a consolidated report for the Board&#13;
based on submissions from Regional Offices and other information and analyses drawn from the&#13;
MIS system. The purpose of the report is to contribute to the preparation of the next annual work&#13;
program and budget for the ESRDF based on (a) past performance, and (b) identified community&#13;
needs. The detailed formats for the regional submissions and consolidated report are specified in&#13;
the MIS Handbook, and summarized here.&#13;
11.   Annual Report. The Fund will prepare an Annual Report for submission to the&#13;
National Board and once approved, for distribution to donors and other interested bodies. The&#13;
report will be prepared when the end of year accounts are available, and will be submitted no&#13;
later than 4 months after the end of the financial year. It will utilize the key performance&#13;
indicators, a sample of which are shown in Table A below, and a format contained in the&#13;
Operational Manual. The report will consist of information and analyses on (a) the performance&#13;
of the ESRDF as a whole for the past year compared to (i) previous years; and (ii) the goals of&#13;
the previous year's program; and (b) the performance of each regional office (i) compared to&#13;
previous years; (ii) compared to the goals of the previous year's program; and (iii) compared to&#13;
overall ESRDF performance standards drawn from an analyses of all regional offices.&#13;
12.   The report will be made up of the following broad categories: (a) the financial&#13;
statement; (b) a presentation of sub-projects at various process stages; (c) an analysis of sub-&#13;
project costs compared to both budgets and ESRDF standards, and including details of&#13;
community capital investments; (d) the planned and actual disbursement schedules; (e) an&#13;
analysis of sub-project processing time against ESRDF standards; (f) a presentation and analysis&#13;
on beneficiaries, to include (i) involvement of women; (ii) numbers of beneficiaries reached; and&#13;

arrangements, including (i) community and regional bureau commitments for newly processed&#13;
sub-projects; and (ii) community and regional bureau performance for completed sub-projects;&#13;
(k) an efficiency analysis at the regional level comparing staffing and other overhead costs to&#13;
number of projects processed and program accomplishment; and (I) a problem analysis&#13;
describing obstacles experienced by the office and measures or proposals for over-coming them.&#13;
13.   Annual Work Program and Budget (AWPB). This will consist of an overall&#13;
submission to the Board and to IDA for the ESRDF, together with separate submissions for each&#13;
office. The AWPB will be made up of the following details: (a) a program of sub-projects drawn&#13;
from the pipeline of community submissions and screened proposals, indicating (i) the&#13;
communities involved; (ii) the sector and goals of the sub-project; (iii) an estimate of the&#13;
numbers of beneficiaries to be reached [including women]; (iv) the broad timetable for&#13;
processing each sub-project; and (iv) sub-project costs, including community contributions;;(b)&#13;
indications of agreement by regional sector bureaus to the proposed sub-project program, and&#13;
arrangements for collaboration; (c) a disbursement schedule; (d) a procurement schedule; (e) a&#13;
sub-project budget; (f) a work load analysis and administrative budget; and (g) a justification&#13;
based on previous performance. In addition, each regional office will establish some broad goals&#13;
for the year ahead in terms of what it wishes to accomplish, its community outreach, its&#13;
collaboration with other facilitators of community development, its capacity building role, its&#13;
contribution to environmental conservation and the social and economic progress of women; and&#13;
its efforts to stimulate the participation of private contractors.&#13;
14.   The Review Process. Each Regional Office will clear its report through its Regional&#13;
Steering Committee before submission to the Central Office. The Central Office will review the&#13;
consolidated report with IDA and thereafter submit the report to the ESRDF Board. The review&#13;
process will always include a review of the Key Performance Indicators presented in the&#13;
following table. Targets for these indicators will be specified each year on the basis of the&#13;
previous year's performance.&#13;
E. Mid-Term Evaluation and Implementation Completion Report&#13;
15.   The mid-term evaluation of the ESRDF will take place after 24 months of operation.&#13;
The main purpose will be to: (i) determine whether satisfactory progress is being made towards&#13;
meeting the original Project objectives; (ii) evaluate the impact of the sub-projects on the&#13;
beneficiaries, (iii) assess whether the arrangements agreed for the upkeep and maintenance of the&#13;
sub-projects after completion, and recurrent cost financing are being honored; and (iv) to draw&#13;
lessons from the experience, enabling the Fund to adapt its methodology for the future. The&#13;
mid-term evaluation will include a review of a representative sample of sub-projects within each&#13;
main sector. Interviews will take place with implementing agencies, Sub-Project Committee&#13;
members/beneficiaries, local governments officials, Regional Steering Committee members,&#13;
contractors, and Fund staff and supervisors. The mid-term review will be conducted by external&#13;
consultants. The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared within six months&#13;
of the end of the ESRDF Project.&#13;

Implementation Plan&#13;
1.    Legal FrameworL The Fund will be established by Proclamation as an autonomous&#13;
public agency with its own procedural, financial, and administrative structures, reporting to a&#13;
national Board.&#13;
2.    Procedures. The Fund will operate on the basis of an Operational Manual, agreed by&#13;
IDA and to be approved by the ESRDF Board prior to credit effectiveness. A draft copy of the&#13;
Operational Manual is available in the Project Files. The Manual will cover (i) the aims and&#13;
objectives of the ESRDF; (ii) organizational structure of the Fund, and the roles of the Board,&#13;
Central Office, Regional Committees, and Regional Offices; (iii) community promotion,&#13;
management and capacity building; (iv) sub-project appraisal (including criteria and technical&#13;
standards), financing; implementation; maintenance, and evaluation; (v) procedures for&#13;
accounting, financing, procurement, disbursement, and reimbursement; (vi) procedures for the&#13;
Annual Review, and Annual Plan and Budget; and the MIS and reporting system; and (vii)&#13;
standard forms. Changes to the Manual will require Board and IDA approval. Handbooks are&#13;
being prepared to provide essential technical information and training materials to guide the&#13;
design, implementation, supervision, and evaluation of sub-projects in each sector.&#13;
3.    Procurement and Disbursement. ESRDF is a demand-based project responding to&#13;
community sub-project proposals. The procurement schedule (below) is based on an assessment&#13;
of demand and implementation capacity.&#13;
4.    Financing Plan. Total project costs have been projected as US$ 242.40 million. IDA&#13;
will finance US $ 120 million, the Government and community contribution will be US$ 60.61&#13;
million, and UNDP US$ 6 million for capacity building component. US$ 55.79 million will be&#13;
met by a number of donors (including the Netherlands, Italy, and Norway) that have made&#13;
commitments in principle, and who will be invited to participate in finalizing the financing plan&#13;
during negotiations.&#13;
5.    ProjectAccounting, Monitoring, andAuditing. The Project Accounting and MIS will&#13;
be operational before credit effectiveness. An external audit of project accounts and procurement&#13;
will be carried out annually. The ESRDF Board will appoint the independent auditor to report on&#13;
the Fund's financial activities no later than six months after the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
6.    Preparatory Actions Already Taken. The Ethiopian team has taken actions to prepare&#13;
for the expanded program, including (a) establishment of all Regional Offices and the structure&#13;
for the Central Office; (b) appointment of ESRDF General Manager and Deputy General&#13;
Manager; (c) recruitment and orientation of key staff, and secondment of some experienced&#13;
ESRF staff to new regions; (d) initial promotional activities and coordination with regional&#13;
bureaus; (e) completion of the Operational Manual, agreed with IDA; (f) completion of the first&#13;
year's Plan and Budget, agreed with IDA, and to be approved by the ESRDF Board prior to&#13;
credit effectiveness; (g) advance procurement of vehicles and essential office equipment; and (h)&#13;
launching of the work program to train staff in MIS and accounting procedures, and to prepare&#13;
priority handbooks.&#13;
7.    Project Launch. The ESRDF with Bank support will organize a Project Launch&#13;
Workshop to introduce (i) the Fund's objectives, approaches, project appraisal and approval&#13;
procedures, and implementation arrangements; (ii) the Annual Review and Planning cycle and&#13;
implementation schedules; (iii) project monitoring and reporting requirements;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
and (iv) procurement and disbursement procedures. The Project Launch Workshop will also&#13;
focus on environmental and gender concerns to ensure that the related processes stated in the&#13;
operational manual are understood by all ESRDF staff; and to highlight the importance of&#13;
implementing such actions. The workshops will also review the results of the initial assignments&#13;
related to handbooks and training for key sectors (see 6 above), and review the capacity building&#13;
plan and program.&#13;
8.    Bank Supervision Plan. The Bank will organize two supervision missions a year to&#13;
assess (i) the effectiveness of ESRDF in attaining project objectives and reaching beneficiaries;&#13;
(ii) compliance with financial management, accounting, procurement and disbursement&#13;
procedures stated in the Operational Manual; (iii) performance based on work programs and&#13;
implementation schedules; (iv) the quality of sub-project processing and results in terms of&#13;
impact, beneficiary participation, technical standards, reaching poor women, and satisfying&#13;
environmental standards; (v) sub-project sustainability in terms of community management of&#13;
maintenance and provision of recurrent costs; (vi) variety and effectiveness of procurement&#13;
arrangements; (vii) utilization of MIS data and project results for improved practices and policy&#13;
changes; (viii) efficiency and overall effectiveness of the ESRDF project mechanism; and (ix)&#13;
progress and results in capacity building. One of the missions will coincide with the Annual&#13;
Review, Plan and Budget. Supervision of environmental aspects will be a part of the terms of&#13;
reference of all supervision missions, but it will be of particular importance during the first,&#13;
third, and mid-term supervision missions. An environmental specialist will be included in these&#13;
missions in order to ensure that processes incorporated in the operational manual are being&#13;
followed; that they are adequate and appropriate; and to recommend any modifications, if&#13;
necessary.&#13;
9.     During the first year, the following sector specific activities will be organized. In the&#13;
area of rural water supply, supervision will be managed by RWSG-EA team in Nairobi. In the&#13;
first year, this team will join the project launch workshop and organize at least one other mission&#13;
specifically to assist on capacity building and the review of handbook preparation. In addition,&#13;
with the help of local consultants, the team will organize a specialized mission prior to each bi-&#13;
annual supervisory mission to prepare a report on how sub-projects comply to the procedures and&#13;
standards stipulated in the Operational Manual and RWS Handbook. The RWSG-EA team will&#13;
work in close collaboration with the RWS component of the proposed IDA Ethiopia Water&#13;
Supply Development and Rehabilitation Project. In the area of small-scale irrigation, the Bank&#13;
team specialist will visit the country to support training activities and the production of the SSI&#13;
Handbook. This will be supplemented by contracts given to specialized engineering firms to&#13;
provide on-site on-the-job training and supervision assistance aimed at ensuring effective&#13;
appraisal, sub-project design, implementation, and arrangements for maintenance. In the area of&#13;
social infrastructure, the team will work closely with the Bank's human resource development&#13;
specialists and on-going IDA-financed basic health and education projects. For the MIS and&#13;
Reporting System, a special mission will be needed early in the first year of implementation to&#13;
test the effectiveness of the system. For capacity building, the Bank and UNDP will collaborate&#13;
on a special mission during the second half of the first year, to review the arrangements and&#13;
progress made in implementing the first phase of the program. For the welfare monitoring&#13;
component, there will be a need in the first year to review the welfare monitoring data collected&#13;
by the CSA, and provide assistance to the Ethiopian team in data analysis. This could involve&#13;
two reciprocal missions.&#13;
&#13;

10.    Finally, the Bank team in collaboration with ESRDF will organize practical research and&#13;
training activities to improve understanding of the ESRDF mechanisms and potential as support&#13;
to better implementation. This will include independent, participative beneficiary assessments.&#13;
11.    Ethiopian Supervisory Mechanisms. On the Ethiopian side, project supervision will be&#13;
carried out at a number of levels. The Regional Steering Committees will supervise the activities&#13;
of their Regional Offices through monthly, half-yearly, and annual reports, and up-to-date MIS&#13;
data at each meeting to review sub-projects for financing. The Central Office supervise regional&#13;
activities through the same monthly and half-yearly reports, periodic MIS updates, the annual&#13;
performance review report, and the quarterly submission of documentation to support&#13;
replenishment requests. The Central Office will prepare consolidated quarterly reports for the&#13;
Board, and the consolidated Annual Review. Staff from the Central Office will visit Regional&#13;
Offices periodically, and contract beneficiary assessments.&#13;
12.    Capacity Building. The capacity building program will be essentially demand and need&#13;
driven. However, in the first year, a number of priorities have been identified and form the basis&#13;
for the following program:&#13;

Rural Water Supply Component&#13;
I.    Background. About 30 percent of ESRDF sub-project support will go to rural water supply&#13;
schemes. In line with Government policy, these will require community contributions to capital costs,&#13;
user fees to cover recurrent costs, and selection of simple and low cost technology manageable by&#13;
communities. The RWS component complements the National Rural Water Supply Program&#13;
(NRWSP) which finance larger schemes for bigger population centers. The Government's Sector&#13;
Policy specifies that public agencies will act as promoters, regulators, and financial providers, with&#13;
beneficiaries responsible for implementation, operation and maintenance. To support this devolution,&#13;
both the ESRDF and the IDA-supported Ethiopia Water Supply Development &amp; Rehabilitation&#13;
Project (WSDRP) will contain substantial capacity building components.&#13;
2.     Scope and Standards of the ESRDF RWS Sub-Projects. ESRDF will support small&#13;
schemes involving hand-dug wells to supply up to 200 beneficiaries, and drilled wells with&#13;
handpumps, and spring developments to serve up to 500 beneficiaries (based on a per capita water&#13;
consumption of 15 to 20 liters a day). Technology selection will be based on factors like locally&#13;
available water sources, cost considerations, community preferences and willingness to pay. The&#13;
number of beneficiaries is a major factor. The ESRDF consulting with the Bank, can consider an&#13;
untypical solution proposed by a community where the community can justify it in cost-benefit and&#13;
social terms, and sustainability. In special situations, the ESRDF could finance options such as&#13;
rainwater harvesting, sub-surface dams, and conventional piped schemes, but all of these will be&#13;
subject to the same stringent appraisal standards. A community's willingness and capacity to make&#13;
additional contributions to both project costs and recurrent expenses can also be taken into account.&#13;
Efforts will also be made to exploit beneficial links between RWS sub-projects and other ESRDF&#13;
initiatives, for example combining water supply for a school with facilities for community households.&#13;
3.     Appraisal. ESRDF appraisal of a community RWS proposal will focus on (i) the&#13;
seriousness of the water problem in the community, and the extent to which the proposed scheme can&#13;
remedy it; (ii) the community's willingness and ability to contribute to both project and recurrent&#13;
costs, and to maintain the scheme; (iii) the appropriateness of the community management structure&#13;
for RWS, and the participation of women; (iv) technical capacity and training requirements for&#13;
implementation and maintenance; (v) potential for self-sufficiency based on feasible user fees; and&#13;
(vi) cost-efficiency of the proposed scheme compared to established investment and recurrent cost&#13;
standards and other feasible options. The financial efficiency assessments will recognize the potential&#13;
for the scheme to improve health and liberate women's time to be used more productively. To ensure&#13;
that communities in sparsely populated areas are not excluded, appraisals will allow for initial&#13;
capacity utilization of 50 percent of the maximum number of beneficiaries served by a particular&#13;
technology, as long as the community is able to increase its contribution to capital and recurrent costs.&#13;
4.    Implementation Structures. The communities will be responsible, through project&#13;
committees, for managing implementation. The ESRDF will work in collaboration with the Ministry&#13;
of Water Resources Development, and the Regional Water Development Bureaus to ensure that the&#13;
ESRDF support meets the policy objectives and standards of the broader RWS program, and to test&#13;
community-based approaches. Regional bureaus will provide technical advice to communities, and&#13;
assist ESRDF in sub-project appraisal, and the supervision of schemes before and after completion,&#13;
including testing water quality. Regional bureaus will need to be satisfied that the typical designs&#13;
incorporated in the ESRDF technical RWS handbook are acceptable, and that sub-projects meet these&#13;
standards before the sub-projects can be financed.&#13;
5.     Maintenance. The regular maintenance of RWS schemes supported by the ESRDF will be&#13;
largely self-financing through the collection of user fees. The financing contract signed with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
Community Project Committee will estimate user fees and specify community organizational&#13;
structures for maintenance and fee collection. Training will be provided for community caretakers,&#13;
and the WRD bureau will regularly inspect schemes to ensure they are being maintained. Maintenance&#13;
for hand-dug wells and spring development schemes will be simple and cheap over the short and&#13;
medium term. For shallow drilled wells, maintenance may be more costly, including periodic cleaning&#13;
of the borehole, replacement of hand-pump components due to corrosion or breakage, and repairs to&#13;
motorized installations, if included. These repairs will be the responsibility of the WRD bureau in the&#13;
short-term as they exceed the capacity of communities. Skilled WDR personnel are located at the&#13;
regional and zonal level, and efforts are under way to build resources at the woreda level. Over time,&#13;
these may be supplemented or replaced by private contractors beginning to emerge in many areas. To&#13;
cover expected maintenance costs, user fees would vary between US$ 2 and 6 per household per year,&#13;
the higher range applying to drilled wells, where communities will pay for the costs of spare parts,&#13;
which are currently distributed by NGOs, regional bureaus, and international agencies.&#13;
6.     Capacity Building. Building up the capacity of regional water development bureaus is a&#13;
major Government priority, and is being supported more broadly by the Bank (through the WSRDP)&#13;
and by UNDP and UNICEF. ESRDF will contribute to the capacity building program, especially at&#13;
the level of community water committees, and in strengthening regional bureaus, NGOs and others to&#13;
operate on a participative basis with community schemes. Training will focus on methods of&#13;
community-based RWS management and maintenance, the technical and financial characteristics of&#13;
technology options, approaches to cost recovery, involvement of community women in RWS, and&#13;
crucial links between RWS initiatives and other sub-sector activities. The ESRDF RWS handbook&#13;
will be an important part of the capacity building program, containing both technical and managerial&#13;
details related to the cost effectiveness and sustainability of community based RWS schemes.&#13;
7.     Sub-Project Costs. Based on assessments of community needs, it is anticipated that ESRDF&#13;
will finance 13,035 RWS schemes. The Table below is based on actual cost experience in Ethiopia.&#13;

handpumps 25% less&#13;
8.     Hand-dug wells and spring development schemes will involve substantial community in-kind&#13;
contributions, saving between 50 and 100 percent of the quoted typical scheme cost compared to sub-&#13;
project implementation contracted out. Shallow drilled wells will involve limited community in-kind&#13;
contributions, but the cost-effectiveness of such operations in Ethiopia has improved in recent years.&#13;
9.     Collaboration and Data Base. Because of the importance of ESRDF's contribution to RWS&#13;
in Ethiopia, ESRDF will work closely with the national and regional RWS authorities in training and&#13;
strengthening institutional structures. ESRDF will establish a comprehensive data base on capital and&#13;
recurrent costs of various types of schemes in various locations; unit costs in terms of beneficiaries&#13;
served; user fee levels; community structures; maintenance performance; and direct and indirect&#13;
benefits. This data base will provide an invaluable analytical tool for the ESRDF and sector planners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H&#13;

Small-Scale Irrigation Component&#13;
1.    Objectives of Component. The objective of this component is to help poor farmers&#13;
overcome rainfall and water constraints to production by providing a more assured supply of&#13;
water for cultivation and livestock, and in this way contributing to strengthening the basis for&#13;
subsistence agriculture, providing increased food security to poor communities, providing a&#13;
source of household income through the sale of surplus production, and overall, assisting the&#13;
increase in domestic food production. Especially in the northern Highlands area, irrigated&#13;
agriculture will make an important contribution to improvement in very poor nutrition levels.&#13;
The ESRDF will support sub-projects initiated by communities or farmer groups to develop&#13;
small-scale irrigation schemes that are simple enough to be managed at the community level, and&#13;
can help stabilize food production by supplementing crop moisture during shortfalls in rain and&#13;
by supporting the cultivation of vegetables during the dry season. In the dry zones, the sub-&#13;
projects will often involve the building of small storage dams which can be used both for&#13;
irrigation and animal watering. Supplementary run-off wells can also be constructed to provide&#13;
separate safe water for domestic use during extreme droughts.&#13;
2.     General Description of the Component. Based on prior assessments of community&#13;
needs, it is anticipated that community proposals would result in the development of 18,000 ha&#13;
of irrigated land through ESRDF-financed sub-projects. On average, this would consist of small&#13;
schemes of between 50 and 200 ha each, distributed throughout the Highlands. Because many of&#13;
the potential sites for these schemes are situated on international waterways, the Government&#13;
calculated the expected overall abstractions from each of these waterways and it was agreed with&#13;
the Bank that these represent the total amounts that the Project will be able to finance.&#13;
3.     Two main irrigation systems will be used: diversions from weirs on rivers with sufficient&#13;
flow throughout the dry season; and storage dams where the river flow is insufficient to provide&#13;
water to the fields. Given the higher cost of the schemes irrigated from storage dams, their areas&#13;
would be small and situated mainly in the driest areas, in the Tekeze basin.&#13;
4.     Technical Issues. As they are major structures, diversion weirs will be made of good&#13;
standard masonry with well-arranged joints and high quality cement mortar. Their crest will be&#13;
subject to strong erosive forces and may need to be constructed of quality reinforced concrete.&#13;
Because of high rates of evaporation and high sediment transport, most of the reservoir dams&#13;
will be no less than 10 to 15 meters high or with storage capacity no less than two million cubic&#13;
meters, and care will be taken to ensure necessary safety features. This will require mechanical&#13;
construction with carefully designed and zoned embankments. Spillways, customarily consisting&#13;
of earth and rock, will be carefully monitored to avoid regressive erosion. For the outlet works,&#13;
use will be made of pipes with upstream valves or within culverts. Works will be carried out by&#13;
hand-labor, if safe and technically possible, especially for storage dams.&#13;
5.     Many schemes are likely to make use of surface water because of their relative&#13;
simplicity for community maintenance and low foreign exchange cost. However, appraisal will&#13;
be concerned to justify costs, and where it is clear that the development of water sources by&#13;
storage or diversion dam would be too costly or unsuitable in a specific situation, pilots will be&#13;
run to test the viability of optional efficient modern methods, for example, in parts of the&#13;
Highlands, the use of pipeline conveyance rather than canals, and pressure systems with small&#13;
sprinklers or drip irrigation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
6.     Special attention will be given to the identification of suitable catchments (given that it&#13;
is often difficult to estimate run-offs from small catchments) to ensure that those selected are&#13;
large enough to fill reservoirs but not so large as to require costly flood disposal. Equally&#13;
important will be the estimation of the likely rate of siltation of reservoirs. The ESRDF will&#13;
develop a research program to improve the accuracy of such estimates, and to monitor existing&#13;
schemes to measure conveyance losses in main canals, and boulder transpiration, including the&#13;
impact of these on diversion weirs. In addition, care will be taken to ensure that appropriate&#13;
treatment of catchment areas takes place in the right sequence, prior to dam construction.&#13;
7.     Critical Appraisal Issues. Small-scale schemes downstream of weirs or dams will be&#13;
designed as an integral part of local peasant farming operations, and the appraisal of weirs and&#13;
dams will pay close attention to the relationship between the investment cost and the number of&#13;
hectares to be irrigated, the number of beneficiary farmers, the fertility and cultivation potential&#13;
of the land in the areas to be irrigated, the crop options, and the likely yields and income from&#13;
such crops. Careful consideration will also be given to recent and likely drought patterns and the&#13;
continuing availability of water, as well as the capacity of community groups to maintain the&#13;
schemes, and their ability to meet recurrent costs through income generated by the facilities.&#13;
Appraisals will also include a catchment analysis to determine the impact of the sub-project on&#13;
both upstream and downstream users. Each scheme will be carefully assessed in terms of its&#13;
environmantal impact and the risk that environmental degradation could harm the sustainability&#13;
of the scheme itself. Another important factor will be the safety of communities living&#13;
downstream of construction in the face of possible construction failure and food. A systematic&#13;
checklist of safety factors is included in the Operational Manual. Each appraisal will contain the&#13;
necessary technical studies (topography, soil survey, hydrological assessments, and&#13;
environmental assessment).&#13;
8.     Structure for Implementation and Maintenance. Special community committees&#13;
made up of the prime beneficiaries, will take responsibility for construction, organization, and&#13;
supervision. The ESRDF will collaborate with the Regional Bureaus of Natural Resources&#13;
(BNR) to support the implementation of this component, supplemented by assistance from the&#13;
Bureaus of Agriculture in the training of farmers in field irrigation, and provision of advice to&#13;
community water user associations. Technical studies associated with sub-project design and&#13;
appraisal will be done by private sub-contractors or NGOs, although in areas where no local&#13;
expertise exists, the BNR will provide support. Small local contractors will be invited to bid on&#13;
construction works, and will be selected and supervised by the community committee. Following&#13;
completion of the scheme, the community project committee will be formed into a Water Users'&#13;
Association, responsible for the management and maintenance of the facilities, and collection of&#13;
user contributions to the recurrent cost fund. The BNR will sign an agreement with the ESRDF&#13;
and community associations to monitor maintenance and provide help where major repairs are&#13;
beyond the capacity of the associations.&#13;
9.     Capacity Building. Training and technical support will be an essential part of the&#13;
component. Such training and support will be provided to all those involved in the success of the&#13;
sub-projects: (i) ESRDF project staff in technical and appraisal criteria, contracting with experts,&#13;
and overall supervision requirements: (ii) farmers in methods of operation and maintenance; and&#13;
(iii) designers in the BNR, private contractors, and specialized NGOs in project design and&#13;
technical methods. In the early years of the Project, the ESRDF will contract foreign experts to&#13;
work alongside local specialists in the design, construction and monitoring of these schemes,&#13;
providing a blend of supervision and on-the-job training. Training will also take the form of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Auoex H&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
short courses and study tours to visit similar schemes. Special efforts will be made to involve&#13;
women in this program.&#13;
10.   Sub-Project Costs. The costs of the small-scale irrigation schemes will vary between&#13;
Birr 15,000 per ha for those without a storage dam, and Birr 30,000 per ha for those with a&#13;
storage dam. These costs are in line with GOE data and FAO reports. Studies and supervision&#13;
will constitute between 3 and 5 percent of the total costs, and training about 5 percent of the total&#13;
costs.&#13;

Welfare Monitoring System (WMS)&#13;
I.    Objectives of the WMS. The WMS will assist the Government to monitor the social&#13;
impact of its economic reform program and their contribution to poverty reduction, helping&#13;
decision-making and planning at both national and regional level. The WMS will be built&#13;
around an Annual Review of Social Trends and Welfare reflecting changes in the status of&#13;
different population groups, and identifying key policy issues for further consideration. The&#13;
system will: (i) present a national and regional review of welfare indicators showing their spatial&#13;
distribution and movements over time; (ii) identify poor and vulnerable groups that require&#13;
targeted assistance; (iii) assess the short and medium term effects of macro-economic and&#13;
sectoral policies and programs on the poor; and (iv) monitor changes in status of the poor and&#13;
vulnerable population groups.&#13;
2.    Institutional Structures and Responsibilities. The WMS will be overseen by a&#13;
national Welfare Review Committee (WRC) which will be chaired by the Minister of Economic&#13;
Development and Cooperation (MEDAC), and whose members will include the Minister or Vice&#13;
Minister from sectoral line ministries (Health, Education, Agriculture, etc.) and RRC, and the&#13;
Director General of the Central Statistics Agency (CSA). The WRC will meet not less that twice&#13;
annually to review the policy implications of WMS reports and to approve the WMS annual&#13;
work program. An Implementation Sub-Committee of the WRC will act as the WMS Steering&#13;
Committee and will supervise implementation of the system. The Sub-Committee will include&#13;
(among others) the Minister of MEDAC, and the General Manager of the CSA. It will meet no&#13;
less than once per quarter, to (i) review the annual work program and budget for the WMS; (ii)&#13;
review the annual financial report; (iii) approve Study Fund applications and monitor their&#13;
delivery; and (iv) authorize WMS expenditure items and contracts over US$ 10,000.&#13;
3.    A Welfare Monitoring Unit (WMU) has been established in MEDAC as the secretariat&#13;
for the WRC. The WMU will consist of a Unit Head, two Economist/Planners, one Statistician&#13;
with good database management skills, and support staff. The WMU will be responsible to the&#13;
Implementation Subcommittee for (i) coordination of the various elements of the system; (ii)&#13;
creation and maintenance of the socio-economic database to facilitate the preparation of the&#13;
annual Review of Social Trends and Welfare, and to support further analytical work and&#13;
evaluation studies; (iii) analysis and policy advice, commissioning position papers for the WRC&#13;
on the social impact of Government policies, working with research agencies such as the&#13;
Ethiopian Food and Nutrition Institute (EFNI) and the Institute for Development Research&#13;
(IDR), as well as private sector consultants; (iv) workshops and seminars at central and regional&#13;
levels to disseminate and promote discussion of information generated by the monitoring system,&#13;
and including an annual national workshop in June/July each year to review the outputs;&#13;
participants will be drawn from government (including representatives from the regional&#13;
planning bureaus), university and research establishments, NGOs, and donors; and (v) technical&#13;
support to regional planning bureaus, to help build up their technical .competencies through&#13;
networking, and through regional seminars held after national workshops.&#13;
4.    A small technical multi-agency WMSAdvisory Group will be established and chaired by&#13;
the Head WMU, and with members drawn from line ministries, CSA, research institutions,&#13;
NGOs and donors. The Advisory Group will meet monthly to help ensure that implementation&#13;
of the WMS benefits from a wide range of views and technical experience, and to review the&#13;
quality of WMS outputs. The group will (i) contribute to the review of the Annual Review of&#13;
Social Trends and the impact of economic and social policies and programs on welfare levels;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
(ii) contribute to the review of applications for use of the Study Fund and make recommendation&#13;
to the Steering Committee; (iii) carry out a technical review of Study Fund outputs; and (iv)&#13;
review and comment on questionnaires for household and community surveys implemented as&#13;
part of the WMS.&#13;
5.    The Central Statistical Authority (CSA) will be represented on the Implementation&#13;
Subcommittee and the Advisory Group and will be a major supplier of data for the WMS. It will&#13;
carry out an annual Welfare Monitoring Survey, based on a questionnaire reviewed by the&#13;
Advisory Group. The CSA will provide additional information for the WMS from its regular&#13;
survey program, including an analysis of the incidence and depth of poverty using a poverty line&#13;
approach; the analysis of expenditures on social services (health and education) in different&#13;
areas, and by households from different socioeconomic groups; and food security analysis by&#13;
area and socio-economic group. The analyses will disaggregate gender data. Given the important&#13;
role that the CSA is to play, the WMS will support a program of institutional strengthening for&#13;
the CSA, which will cover (i) data collection; strengthening the field activities of the CSA&#13;
through provision of vehicles and field equipment for carrying out its household survey program;&#13;
and (ii) data processing: a phased program to replace CSA's obsolete equipment and train staff&#13;
in modem PC-based processing techniques including the use of statistical software; and a phased&#13;
program to transfer this capacity to the regions.&#13;
6.    Sectoral Ministries and the RRC also undertake data collection and analysis in their own&#13;
sectors, and maintain their own information systems. The results of these analytical activities&#13;
will be fed into the WMS. The monitoring activities of the RRC in the areas of food supply and&#13;
agricultural production provide essential short-term indicators of economic stress. The Ministry&#13;
of Health has an extensive information system collected from the community health service,&#13;
health stations and hospitals and which may be used to measure the delivery of services to the&#13;
poorer and more vulnerable communities. The same applies to the data generated by the annual&#13;
schools census administered by the Ministry of Education, providing updates of key indicators&#13;
such as enrollment rates and age/grade mismatches. In both these ministries however, resources&#13;
have been severely stretched to the extent that their information systems are now very&#13;
incomplete and there are major delays in the production of data. While the WMS will not be a&#13;
vehicle for financing major structural reforms to these sectoral information systems, use may be&#13;
made of the Study Fund to support specific pieces of analysis or to help unblock access to&#13;
specific information of importance to the WMS.&#13;
7.    University, Research, and Market Research Institutions. The WMS will encourage&#13;
stronger links between government agencies and research establishments such as the Ethiopian&#13;
Food and Nutritional Institute (EFNI), the Institute of Development Research (IDR) and the&#13;
Economics Department of Addis Ababa University (ED/AAU). Representatives from the&#13;
academic community will be represented on the Advisory Group, and the Study Fund will help&#13;
promote policy-relevant research. For example it may be used to support and extend the&#13;
collaborative research project between the ED/AAU and the IDR which has established a panel&#13;
survey of households to study the changes in wealth in rural Ethiopia. This study is expected to&#13;
provide important insights concerning the impact of macro-economic changes on the welfare of&#13;
different population groups. The Study Fund can also be used to complement statistical surveys&#13;
with qualitative and participative surveys using group interviews, beneficiary assessments and&#13;
other forms of observation.&#13;
8.    The main regional institutions for coordinating welfare monitoring activities, will be the&#13;
regional planning bureau with which the WMU will form a welfare monitoring network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
Initially, the WMU will collaborate with the regional planning bureaus to institute annual&#13;
workshops at the regional level, which would closely follow the annual national workshops and&#13;
which would be used to assess the regional implications of the WMS results. Over time, the&#13;
regional planning bureaus will be assisted to establish units which would replicate the activities&#13;
of the WMU. The WMS Study Fund may be used to support feasibility studies on how best to&#13;
strengthen regional welfare monitoring capabilities. The CSA is currently relatively centralized&#13;
with all data being processed centrally, and given the technical nature of this work, this is likely&#13;
to continue for a while. However the WMS will be used as a vehicle to progressively&#13;
decentralize CSA activities and build up regional competencies in the area of data entry, editing&#13;
and processing. Some capacity is already being created in these areas through the UNICEF-&#13;
assisted program to support monitoring and evaluation in 64 woredas.&#13;
9.    Management of the WMS Study Fund. The Study Fund will enable the WMU to&#13;
contract local and international consultants to carry out studies or surveys on specific issues&#13;
relevant to the WMS. The Fund aims to promote and foster the development of in-country&#13;
analytical and research skills, both in government agencies and independent research groups and&#13;
the private sector. The kind of studies to be supported may include national and regional poverty&#13;
profiles to measure levels of poverty and describe the socio-economic characteristics of the poor&#13;
by region and socio-economic group; social sector studies and public expenditure reviews to&#13;
measure the effectiveness of social sector policies and interventions on the poor and vulnerable;&#13;
labor and employment studies, including gender studies, aimed at promoting equal opportunities&#13;
and more effective income-generating opportunities for women; and food security assessments,&#13;
including reviews of agricultural production. The Study Fund may also be used to organize&#13;
seminars and workshops, particularly where they relate to the dissemination and review of WMS&#13;
studies. It may also be used to promote methodological innovation (including the application of&#13;
beneficiary and participatory poverty assessments), and the development, testing and application&#13;
of rapid low cost processes for data collection, entry and processing.&#13;
10.   The WMS Advisory Group will carry out technical reviews of all applications to the&#13;
Study Fund and make recommendations to the Steering Group for final decision. All contracts&#13;
with an estimated value more than US$ 20,000 with individuals and more than US$ 50,000 with&#13;
firms will also need prior review by the Bank. The Study Fund will be administered by the&#13;
WMU which will be responsible for processing all proposals, signing contracts, supervising&#13;
implementation and disbursements, and preparing quarterly progress reports on ongoing studies&#13;
for the Steering Committee. Study fund applications may be initiated in two ways. Studies or&#13;
activities may be identified by the WRC, Advisory Group, or WMU, and for contracts above US&#13;
$ 20,000, terms of reference will be advertised locally, a shortlist of qualified individual or&#13;
organizational applicants drawn up, and these invited to submit proposals covering the research&#13;
objectives, the methodology to be used, method of managing the study, a schedule of activities&#13;
and outputs, and a resource requirement and budget. Applications may also be initiated directly&#13;
by individuals or organizations seeking support to carry out research or studies which would be&#13;
of direct benefit to the WMS.&#13;
11.   WMS Supported Capacity Building. The WMS will help build improved capacity, at&#13;
national and regional levels, to use qualitative and quantitative information to develop more&#13;
effective programs and policies. WMU staff and other analysts will participate in short courses&#13;
both in-country and abroad, in topics such as welfare analysis, database management, social&#13;
sector studies, labor and employment studies, food security, and gender studies. An important&#13;
element of the capacity building will be the national and regional workshops organized by the&#13;
WMU to review the outputs of the WMS. The WMS will help statisticians and data processing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
specialists to upgrade their skills through short term courses offered in Ethiopia, and seminars&#13;
and conferences outside the country. The WMS will also provide specific training of field and&#13;
data entry staff of the CSA for the implementation of the Welfare Monitoring Survey and price&#13;
collection activities.&#13;
12.   Technical Assistance. In addition to employing consultants through the WMS Study&#13;
Fund for specific assignments, the Project makes provision for longer-term technical assistance&#13;
to build institutional capacity in the key institutions responsible for implementing the WMS.&#13;
Technical assistance to the WMU will assist the design, development and maintenance of the&#13;
socioeconomic database; and assistance will be provided to the CSA for survey and sample&#13;
design, and for data processing and analysis.&#13;
13.   Project Implementation. The WMU and CSA will be responsible for preparing Annual&#13;
Budget and Work Plans and financial reports for their respective components which will be&#13;
consolidated into a single report by the WMU for review and approval by the Steering&#13;
Committee and the Bank. Two special accounts for the WMS will be opened and operated by&#13;
the CSA and WMU respectively. Co-signatories for the WMU account will be the Chairman of&#13;
the Steering Committee (or his appointee) and the Head of the WMU, and for the CSA account,&#13;
the Chairman of the Steering Committee (or his appointee) the Director General of the CSA. The&#13;
GSA and WMU will be responsible for maintaining accounts which will be audited at the same&#13;
time and according to the same auditing procedures as have been established for the ESRDF.&#13;
Both organizations will also be responsible for disbursements (under the same rules governing&#13;
the ESRDF Project) and for the submission of applications for replenishment/reimbursement of&#13;
their respective special accounts.&#13;
14.   Implementation Schedule. The work of the WMU and WRC will follow a standard&#13;
cycle: each July the WMU will organize a national workshop to review welfare issues based on&#13;
the WMU's Annual Review of Social Trends, followed by assistance to regional planning&#13;
bureaus to organize regional workshops in the regions. The CSA will play a central role in&#13;
providing the WMS with household and community level data at the necessary levels of&#13;
disaggregation. In thefirst twelve month phase, the CSA will concentrate on implementing a&#13;
number of surveys relevant to the WMS that have already been prepared including an&#13;
Agricultural Sample Survey, and a Household Income, Consumption and Expenditure Survey.&#13;
For these surveys to make a useful input into the WMS, usable results will have to be made&#13;
available within no less than six months of the end of fieldwork. As the CSA cannot achieve this&#13;
with its existing resources, the WMS will support the CSA's efforts to help accelerate the&#13;
process. These surveys will be supplemented by adding a short Welfare Module to the ICES to&#13;
capture additional information to be used in preparing poverty profiles, such as distance to and&#13;
use of social services and amenities. In addition to data collection at the household level, the&#13;
CSA also collects price data on a continuous basis across the country. These data will also be&#13;
important inputs into the WMS, to help develop price deflators for comparing welfare levels over&#13;
time and space, and to serve as early indicators of economic stress.&#13;
15.   In the secondphase, the WMS will support the CSA's carrying out an annual Welfare&#13;
Monitoring Survey, possibly linked to an agricultural production/forecast survey. While details&#13;
of the contents of the survey will be worked out (following the analysis of the 1994/5 surveys),&#13;
key features will include: a short core questionnaire to be repeated annually, very short turn-&#13;
around time between data collection and the presentation of results, and the use of a sample size&#13;
large enough to present results at zonal level. The price collection activities will also continue to&#13;
provide important inputs into the WMS. The possibility will also be explored of using the&#13;

Environmental Assessment&#13;
I.    General. The Transitional Government of Ethiopia is committed to addressing&#13;
environmental issues and in ensuring that economic growth in the future will be sustainable.&#13;
Since 1990, a process has been underway to develop a National Conservation Strategy (NCS),&#13;
which is the Ethiopian Government's equivalent to a National Environmental Action Plan. The&#13;
NCS, which articulates a set of policies. strategies, actions and investment programs to address&#13;
the main environmental and development issues currently prevailing in the country, is shortly to&#13;
be approved by the Council of Ministers. Eventually, each regional Government will be&#13;
expected to formulate regional conservation strategies based on the guiding principles and&#13;
framework of the National Conservation Strategy. The NCS is comprehensive in scope,&#13;
highlighting a range of issues across several sectors including land degradation and loss of tree&#13;
cover, insufficient supply and poor quality of water resources, urban degradation, progressive&#13;
loss of bio-diversity and inappropriate rangeland management. It is within the context of this&#13;
overall strategy that the Government aims to pursue two important environmental objectives&#13;
under the ESRDF project. The first is to ensure that each sub-project approved for funding, will&#13;
have been reviewed for potential negative environmental impacts and that appropriate mitigating&#13;
measures will have been taken for any impacts identified. Projects which are found to have&#13;
negative environmental impacts which cannot be adequately mitigated will not be approved for&#13;
funding. The second is to use the project as a vehicle for proactively pursuing the Government's&#13;
environmental objectives through promoting better environmental practices and increasing the&#13;
positive environmental impact of sub-projects.&#13;
2.     Environmental Effects of Sub-Projects. In most cases the negative environmental&#13;
impact of the individual sub-projects is expected to be localized and limited. Table I lists the&#13;
main categories of projects identified by the Government as those most likely to be requested by&#13;
communities. Column two of the table briefly highlights the potential negative effects of each&#13;
category of project with column three specifying the mitigating measures that may be necessary&#13;
to overcome these effects. The only potential area of concern relates to small-scale irrigation&#13;
sub-projects. Here, necessary actions will be incorporated at the design stage. For example,&#13;
attention will need to be paid to ensure that adequate soil conservation measures are undertaken&#13;
in the case of micro-dam construction to stem the effects of high levels of siltation, a common&#13;
problem throughout most of Ethiopia. Adequate extension support to farmers in the proper use of&#13;
irrigated land will also be important not only to enhance the quality of the project's impact on&#13;
agricultural productivity, but also to prevent more serious problems of water logging and&#13;
salinization of the soils. Awareness of prevailing land use patterns will also be important. Care&#13;
will need to be taken to ensure that irrigation schemes do not displace local populations who&#13;
might be using the area for grazing or rain fed farming, that the schemes do not damage the&#13;
access to water of downstream communities, and that appropriate measures are taken to prevent&#13;
an increased incidence of water borne or water-related diseases as a result of the new dams or&#13;
irrigation channels.&#13;
3.     The remaining categories of sub-projects to be funded under ESRDF are expected to&#13;
have relatively minor negative environmental impacts, though these will still need to be taken&#13;
seriously. For instance, poorly managed water supply or sanitation schemes can sometimes&#13;
create greater health hazards than those that they were originally designed to address. Health&#13;
and education centers, if constructed with wood can contribute to the depletion of forest&#13;
resources in the local neighborhood. Medical wastes can also generate a health hazard if they are&#13;
not properly disposed of. Micro-enterprises and other income-generating activities can make&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex J&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
unsustainable demands on local wood or water supplies if improperly designed. All these&#13;
potential impacts can be identified during appraisal process and addressed in project design. For&#13;
instance, alternative construction materials to wood could be found. Incinerators for the proper&#13;
disposal of waste materials could be constructed at health center sites. Measures to ensure proper&#13;
drainage and protection around a water source could be enforced etc.&#13;
4.     Building Capacity. The key to ensuring that appropriate measures to safeguard against&#13;
negative environmental impacts under the project is to ensure that the ESRDF staff have the&#13;
capacity to adequately screen, oversee the design of sub-projects and monitor their&#13;
implementation in accordance with environment criteria. The present capacity of ESRDF to&#13;
undertake any of these functions is weak. In order to meet its environmental objectives, ESRDF&#13;
will need to devote substantial effort and resources to building up the capacity of the ESRDF&#13;
staff to carry out its environmental work.&#13;
5.    There are three main ways in which this capacity will be strengthened. First of all the&#13;
process by which sub-projects are screened, appraised and approved, will be designed in such as&#13;
way that potential negative environmental impacts can be identified at an early stage and&#13;
adequate mitigating measures incorporated into the project design in consultation with the&#13;
community/ies concerned. To this end the ESRDF Operational Manual has been designed to&#13;
include an environmental checklist for each of the main categories of project that are likely to be&#13;
requested by communities. Where potential problems are identified, ESRDF staff will review&#13;
what kind of mitigating measures might be appropriate and who will be responsible for&#13;
implementing these. ESRDF will then be responsible for ensuring that these measures are&#13;
adhered to in the design and implementation of the project by the communities concerned and&#13;
their contractees. Close attention will be paid to modifying or updating the checklists once the&#13;
ESRDF staff have had a chance to apply them in practice.&#13;
6.     The second way in which ESRDF capacity will be enhanced, is by ensuring&#13;
appropriately skilled staff in ESRDF. Given that environmental issues are generally closely&#13;
interwoven with sectoral concerns, the appointment of additional staff to deal specifically with&#13;
environmental issues will be avoided as far as possible. Rather, the aim will be to train individual&#13;
sector specialists to integrate appropriate environmental approaches into their mainstream&#13;
activities. To oversee the ESRDF's environmental activities and capacity building efforts, a&#13;
broad based technical environmental specialist will be appointed at the Central Office to act as a&#13;
catalyst for all issues of environmental concern under the project. This person will have overall&#13;
responsibility for providing technical support and back-up to regional offices, organize training,&#13;
review and update the sections of the operational manual relating to environmental appraisal and&#13;
assessment and ensuring that the project's environmental objectives are being achieved.&#13;
7.    At the regional level, one existing staff (not necessarily an environmental specialist) will&#13;
be designated as environmental focal point with responsibility for overseeing and coordinating&#13;
the implementation of the ESRDF's environmental agenda at the regional level. It is anticipated&#13;
that there will be times when additional specific expertise will be required, for instance if there is&#13;
a need for a more in-depth environmental assessment of a sub-project or to draw up&#13;
environmental check-lists for new categories of projects not already covered by the operational&#13;
manual. In such cases the project will draw on locally available expertise on a consultancy basis.&#13;
A roster of suitably qualified environmental specialists will be drawn up by the project at an&#13;
early stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex J&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
8.     The third way in which environmental capacity will be strengthened, is through&#13;
providing ESRDF staff, particularly at the regional level, with increased awareness of&#13;
environmental issues related to the community based activities implemented under the project,&#13;
and with the skills to appraise sub-projects for their possible environmental effect. In addition to&#13;
training ESRDF staff, the project will also provide technical training to selected Government&#13;
staff and other stakeholders. This training would be aimed at providing the skills to integrate&#13;
environmental concerns into sub-project design, and for ensuring that activities under the sub-&#13;
projects will be environmentally sustainable. Specific training modules for this purpose will be&#13;
devised and included as part of more general technical training that will be implemented under&#13;
the ESRDF project. In certain cases training of selective groups of government development&#13;
agents will also be undertaken to enhance their skills in training project beneficiaries to make&#13;
sub-project activities environmentally sustainable (e.g. appropriate soil and water conservation&#13;
practices in connection with small-scale irrigation projects).&#13;
9.     Promoting the Government's Environmental Objectives. One important way in&#13;
which the Government plans to promote its environmental agenda is to incorporate&#13;
environmental perspectives in the ESRDF's community promotion activities. The purpose will&#13;
be to inform communities of possible means of addressing some of their more serious&#13;
environmental problems such as land degradation (including gulleying), loss of tree cover and&#13;
lack of water for agricultural or domestic purposes. Care will be taken not to impose solutions on&#13;
communities, but rather to present them with a range of options and inform them of what other&#13;
communities have already tried and their successes. In addition to encouraging specific&#13;
'environment' sub-projects, ESRDF will also make efforts to encourage environmentally positive&#13;
components to be built into the various categories of sub-projects. For instance, the use of&#13;
renewable energy such as solar panels, will be explored as a source of energy for health clinics or&#13;
for micro-enterprises requiring power, rather than resorting to fuel wood. Tree planting will be&#13;
encouraged in the vicinity of schools and health clinics funded under the project. Water&#13;
harvesting in the form of roof catchments will be encouraged as part of the design of school&#13;
buildings or health facilities. These and similar components will be based on natural community&#13;
incentives as well as best local practices observed by the ESRDF in its field work with&#13;
communities.&#13;
10.   Monitoring. The performance of ESRDF in ensuring that environmental concerns are&#13;
appropriately incorporated into the project will be closely monitored particularly during the first&#13;
year of project implementation. ESRDF environmental coordinator in the Central Office will&#13;
have primary responsibility for maintaining regular contact with regional staff, obtaining feed-&#13;
back from them on the fulfillment of their environmental functions and modifying procedures in&#13;
accordance with feed-back and recommendations from project staff. A thorough review of the&#13;
process of integrating environmental concerns into project activities will be undertaken at the&#13;
end of the first year. In addition, environmental indicators have been incorporated into the&#13;
project MIS and evaluation systems so that the ESRDF can keep track of whether the appraisal&#13;
process is indeed resulting in environmentally sound projects. Each major report on ESRDF&#13;
performance will contain chapters on its environmental activities and their achievements.&#13;

Gender Action Plan&#13;
I.    The "National Policy on Ethiopian Women" highlights that although women actively&#13;
participate in all walks of life, they do not usually benefit from their labor and are not given an&#13;
equal chance to compete with men. The majority work in the informal economic sectors and the&#13;
average rural women's work day, with regional and cultural variations, is between 13 to 17 hours,&#13;
with very low income. Land is normally registered to the male head of the household and&#13;
excludes women. The Policy adds that women spend on an average 5 hours collecting fuel wood&#13;
for cooking and carry 28 kilos of wood. Water is carried at least twice a day, on average over a&#13;
distance of 3 to 5 km. Only 5 percent of all women are assisted by trained mid-wives. The&#13;
maternal mortality rate is one of the highest in the developing world, at 20 per 1000 live births.&#13;
Each year, 17,000 women die if child bearing complications. Ethiopia also has a very high&#13;
fertility rate of 7.5 children per woman. Ninety-eight percent of Ethiopian women have no&#13;
access to family planning services. The Policy also acknowledges that existing legislation assists&#13;
in perpetuating a secondary socio-economic status for women.&#13;
2.     The Policy encourages the integration of gender issues in the overall development&#13;
program of the country to enhance the participation of women, to make them equal beneficiaries&#13;
of development programs, and to safeguard their right and equal access to land and property.&#13;
3.    In keeping with the stated objectives of the National Policy, the ESRDF has developed a&#13;
Gender Action Plan (GAP) to address gender issues in sub-projects financed by the Fund. GAP&#13;
has been designed to reinforce the demand-driven approach of the Fund and is summarized in the&#13;
attachment. The key elements of GAP include: (i) special promotional activity to encourage&#13;
communities to plan and design projects focusing on women's priorities and needs; (ii)&#13;
incorporation of measures in all existing processes in a sub-project cycle to ensure identification&#13;
of any adverse gender impact; (iii) development of indicators to prioritize the selection of sub-&#13;
projects addressing priorities and needs of women; (iv) encouragement to include nutritional&#13;
activities that focus on the needs of women and children; (v) encouraging the design of income-&#13;
generating activities for women, coupled with savings schemes; (vi) involving NGOs specialized&#13;
in women's development to assist ESRDF implementation in ways that benefit women; (vii)&#13;
incorporation into training activities, attention to the socio-economic constraints women face,&#13;
and opportunities for their advancement; (viii) inclusion of gender indicators in the project MIS&#13;
and reporting system; and (ix) inclusion of a specialized staff member in the ESRDF Central&#13;
Office to take charge of coordinating women's activities, imparting gender sensitivity training to&#13;
all staff of the Fund, and monitoring the impact of ESRDF activities on women. During the&#13;
lifetime of the Project, the ESRDF and the Bank project team will carry out participatory&#13;
beneficiary impact studies, in which the specific patterns related to women can be identified.&#13;

            Ethiopia - Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation
            and Development Fund Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and
            Development Fund Project (ESRDF) will provide to poor,
            mainly rural communities the assets and services needed to
            improve their economic and social standards. ESRDF will
            provide financial and technical support to communities and
            community groups to construct or rehabilitate, and maintain
            basic economic and social infrastructure and services that
            they have prioritized and in which they are willing to
            invest. In addition, ESRDF will support community actions
            aimed at environmental conservation and rehabilitation.
            ESRDF's efforts will be focused on poor communities,
            and especially, poor women. To achieve these goals, ESRDF
            will strengthen community capacity in project
            identification, implementation, and maintenance. The project
            will also support the establishment of a Welfare Monitoring
            System to strengthen capacity to collect and analyze
            information related to causes, patterns, and incidence of
            poverty; and improve the basis for developing poverty
            reduction strategies, assessing the impact on the poor of
            economic policy reform, and evaluating the benefits of other
            poverty reductions interventions. The components of this
            project will be as follows: 1) construction and
            rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure and
            improvement of related services including basic health and
            education, small-scale irrigation, urban sanitation and
            rural water supply; 2) welfare monitoring system; and 3)
            capacity building, training and research.
