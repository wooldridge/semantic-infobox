Note !-Organization&#13;
&#13;
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the International Cen-&#13;
tre for Settlement of Investment Disputes       Centre) entered into Administrative Arrangements&#13;
effective October 14, 1966. The Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements (the Memoran-&#13;
dum) provides that, except to the extent that the Centre may be reimbursed by the         to pro-&#13;
ceedings for fees and expenses of members of Conciliation Commissions, Arbitral Tribunals or ad&#13;
hoc Committees, the Bank shall provide facilities and services, as described in Notes 2 and 3, to&#13;
the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#13;
&#13;
Basis of Accounting: The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally&#13;
accepted accounting principles in the United States and with International Accounting Standards,&#13;
and in accordance with the Memorandum.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Statement Presentation: As of June 30, 1996, the Centre adopted the revised Stan-&#13;
dards for Financial Reporting set forth in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 117,&#13;
"Financial Statements of Not-For-Pmflt-Organizations" (SFAS No. 117). As of July 1, 1         the Cen-&#13;
tre changed its method of accounting for contributions received from the Bank to adopt the provi-&#13;
sion of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 116, "Accounting for Contributions&#13;
Recewed and Contributions Made" (SFAS No 116). The implementation of SFAS No. 116 resulted&#13;
in the adoption of the Statement of Activities to reflect non-cash transactions related to the value of&#13;
those services provided by the Bank which are Identified as directly related to the Centre. There&#13;
has been no effect on net assets previously reported as a result of this implementation, however&#13;
prior year's financial statements are restated to conform to the current year presentation.&#13;

                  of Investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              In our opinion the accompanying statement of net assets and the related statements of activities&#13;
              and of changes in cash and investments present fairly, in all material respects, the financial posi-&#13;
              tion of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment          at June 30, 1997 and 1996 and&#13;
              its activities and changes in its cash and investments for the years then ended, in conformity with&#13;
              generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and with International Accounting&#13;
              Standards, and in accordance with the Administrative Arrangement between the International Bank&#13;
              for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the International Centre for Settlement of In-&#13;
              vestment Disputes (the Centre). These financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank and&#13;
              the Centre's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements&#13;
              based on our audits. vVe conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally&#13;
              accepted auditing standards, including International Standards on Auditing, which require that we&#13;
              plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements&#13;
              are free of material misstatement An audit includes examining. on a test           evidence support-&#13;
              ing the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles&#13;
              used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial state-&#13;
              ment presentation. vVe believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion ex-&#13;
              pressed above.&#13;
&#13;
              As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, effective July l, 1996 the Centre adopted State-&#13;
              ment of Financial Accounting Standards No. 116, "Accounting lor Contributions Received and Con-&#13;
              tributions Made." This standard was adopted on a retroactive basis, and accordingly, the June 30,&#13;
              1996 financial statements have been restated.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            During fiscal year 1997, Croatia signed
            the ICSID Convention and Bosnia and Herzegovina ratified it.
            Including Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are now 30 European
            Countries that are ICSID members.  Altogether, there were,
            at the close of the fiscal year, 141 signatory states of the
            convention and 127 members&#146; countries of ICSID. Investment
            treaties continued to be concluded in significant numbers.
            ICSID staffs have counted almost 1.200 such treaties so far.
            In sum, 1997 was a very active and fruitful year for the
            center in which it further developed its significant role in
            the resolution of legal disputes relating to foreign
            investment and in the progressive development of the law
            governing such investment.
