    Executive summary&#13;
&#13;
    Slightly more than a decade ago, in 1999, the World                             within the project cycle, there are also opportunities to&#13;
    Bank held a seminar-workshop entitled Improving the                             perfect this approach in a number of contexts (for example,&#13;
    Sustainability of Water and Sanitation Projects in the                          greater inclusion of marginalized populations), as well as&#13;
    Rural Area in Cusco, Peru, for the purpose of identifying                       to incorporate it into strategic medium- and long-term&#13;
    best practices in the rural area. One of the key issues during                  municipal decisions.&#13;
    this seminar was understanding the scope and contribution&#13;
    of a demand-based approach in relation to the sustainability                    Third, there is the challenge of maximizing the process of&#13;
    of services.                                                                    decentralization in the municipalities to support services&#13;
                                                                                    in rural areas. It was recommended that the municipal&#13;
    Ten years later, in May 2010, an opportunity was provided                       authority play a larger role in promoting demand and&#13;
    to review the lessons learned, the progress achieved, and the                   contributing to municipal funding, in facilitating technical&#13;
    new challenges for water and rural sanitation within the                        assistance, and in following up and monitoring the services&#13;
    framework of the seminar Challenges of Rural Water and                          and the quality of the water resources that affect more than&#13;
    Sanitation after a Decade, also held in Cusco.                                  one rural community.&#13;
&#13;
    The participants in â&#128;&#156;Cusco+10â&#128;? concluded that, during                           Fourth, it was agreed that one of the pending issues is the need&#13;
    the course of the past decade, there had been progress in                       for sector policies and financial policies on water and rural&#13;
    the rural sector, but certain challenges remained in terms                      sanitation. It was therefore recommended to look for ways&#13;
    of sustainability of the services. While there is optimism                      of placing water and rural sanitation on the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s agenda,&#13;
    that Latin America and the Caribbean will meet the target                       while at the same time promoting consistency and alignment&#13;
    under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for                               between national efforts and international cooperation.&#13;
    safe drinking water, it is more questionable whether the&#13;
    region will meet the target for access to improved sanitation                   And fifth, the participants agreed on the need to emphasize&#13;
    services, given that seven out of every ten people who                          the long-term sustainability of monitoring systems.&#13;
    remain without access in Latin America live in rural areas.                     Emphasis was placed on the importance of financial&#13;
                                                                                    sustainability to ensure the viability of short-, medium-,&#13;
    The Cusco+10 analysis ended up identifying five main                            and long-term goals (for example, administration-&#13;
    challenges that must be taken into account over the next                        operation-maintenance-replacement-expansion), as well&#13;
    decade to help ensure the sustainability of water supply and                    as the importance of environmental sustainability. The&#13;
    sanitation services in rural areas.                                             Cusco+10 analysis concluded that monitoring systems are a&#13;
                                                                                    fundamental piece in long-term sustainability, and yet there&#13;
    In the first place, the challenge of seeking sustainability                     continue to be very few of them in the region.&#13;
    for basic rural sanitation continues. In response to this&#13;
    challenge, it was recommended to develop a comprehensive                        Finally, in the discussions at Cusco+10 the participants&#13;
    vision to be shared for investments in basic sanitation and                     agreed that five cross-cutting trends have emerged in&#13;
    other investments in drinking water and environment                             recent years that will have to be taken into account in&#13;
    protection, and at the same time to draw up a menu of                           the strategies for addressing the challenges of the next&#13;
    options for solving the sanitation challenges faced by                          decade. These cross-cutting trends are: (i)Â recognition that&#13;
    households that are still without access.                                       the demand is diversified; (ii)Â  the importance of water&#13;
                                                                                    resources management; (iii)Â the importance of inter-sector&#13;
    The second challenge to be identified was thinking beyond                       coordination; (iv)Â  financial management of the services&#13;
    the project cycle with the demand-based approach. Just as                       over the medium and long term; and (v)Â the use of public-&#13;
    the virtues of the demand-based approach are well recognized                    private-social partnerships as a tool for enhancing synergy.&#13;

&#13;
Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The rural population of Latin America and the Caribbean                                      In 1999, the objective was to share the experiences of&#13;
exceeds 120 million. Of this number, approximately                                           program-executing institutions and drinking water and&#13;
20Â  percent lack access to improved water services and                                       rural sanitation projects. One of the key issues that drove the&#13;
45Â  percent lack sanitation services,1 without considering                                   first seminar was the promotion of â&#128;&#156;demand-basedâ&#128;? projects&#13;
the quality and continuity of the services. At the same time,                                within the framework of a participatory process in which&#13;
a World Bank study conducted in Bolivia and Peru2 shows                                      the communities decided on their degree of commitment to&#13;
that, for the population that has access to these services,                                  the projects and identified the level of service they expected&#13;
although drinking water services in rural areas cover their                                  to receive and how much they were willing to pay to make&#13;
operation and maintenance costs, they are not financially                                    it sustainable. A decade later, at â&#128;&#156;Cusco+10,â&#128;? the intention&#13;
sustainable in the medium term and require additional                                        was to analyze any new challenges that had arisen from a&#13;
capital to replace the current infrastructure or expand                                      more sectoral standpoint and within the framework of the&#13;
coverage. What is needed at this point is to call attention                                  social, economic, and political changes that had taken place&#13;
to the importance of mobilizing institutional and financial                                  in the region.&#13;

    the report, Basic Rural Services at the End of the 20th&#13;
    Century, summarizes the situation as it stood in the&#13;
    1990s and the conclusions reached at the 1999 seminar-&#13;
    workshop. The second part, Trends in the First Decade&#13;
    of the 21st Century, identifies some of the new variables&#13;
    that have emerged and are shaping the context as work&#13;
    continues toward establishing sustainable services. The&#13;
    third part, Challenges for the Next Decade, reports the&#13;
    findings from the Cusco+10 analysis and sums them up in&#13;
    five major challenges to be addressed. Finally, the fourth&#13;
    part, Conclusions, looks to the future and suggests some&#13;
    new trends that are affecting the five major cross-cutting&#13;
    themes.&#13;
&#13;
    Creating a regional overview of the subject of water and&#13;
    rural sanitation is not easy, considering the heterogeneity&#13;
    that exists in Latin America, with different levels of rural and&#13;
    institutional development, different systems of government,&#13;
    and different ethnic customs. Nevertheless, the effort has&#13;
    been highly rewarding and valuable for identifying best&#13;
    practices and highlighting the best lessons learned so that&#13;
    they can be transferred and replicated. It is hoped that the&#13;
    analysis emanating from a future Cusco+20 will be able to&#13;
    show major achievements at the regional level with ever&#13;
    smaller numbers of people without access to basic services&#13;
    and more countries providing sustainable services for their&#13;
    entire rural population.&#13;

     Against this backdrop, the first seminar-workshop,&#13;
     Improving the Sustainability of Water and Sanitation&#13;
     Projects in the Rural Area, was held with a view to&#13;
     improving the capacity of the institutions involved in&#13;
     helping communities to obtain water and sanitation services&#13;
     that would respond to the demand and be sustainable.&#13;
     Accordingly, the analysis focused on the institutional&#13;
     framework and policies, as well as the project cycle. The&#13;
     seminar-workshop opened up an important opportunity for&#13;
     discussion and analysis among representatives of programs&#13;
     and projects in eight countries, and it succeeded in&#13;
     identifying six key points for supporting the sustainability&#13;
     of future investments in the sub-sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Conclusions from 1999&#13;
&#13;
        The 1999 Cusco seminar-workshop identified six key points for&#13;
        the sustainability of water and rural sanitation:&#13;
&#13;
        i)    Water and sanitation goes beyond investment in infrastructure;&#13;
              it requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach.&#13;
&#13;
        ii)   There must be a national policy for the sector that helps to&#13;
              define competencies and includes a financial policy.&#13;
&#13;
        iii) Community development, evidenced in participative&#13;
             processes, including the gender perspective, is crucial to&#13;
             providing sustainable services.&#13;
&#13;
        iv) The providers of goods and services play a proactive role in              A culture of payment for services should be instilled to guarantee the&#13;
            all phases of the project cycle.                                          quality and sustainability of water and sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
        v)    The preinvestment model should ensure that there is effective&#13;
              demand in the community, that commitments have been made,&#13;
              and that the project is technically viable.&#13;
&#13;
        vi) Efficient management should take steps to ensure good long-&#13;
            term operation (safe water; efficient administration, operation,&#13;
            and maintenance; and provision for certain replacement costs).&#13;

The strategies and the scheme for implementation of water                                 sustainability, beyond just viability in terms of&#13;
and sanitation services in the rural area have evolved well                               operation and maintenance. This long-term outlook&#13;
from the early approach of system construction (oriented                                  is reflected in financial concerns related to the&#13;
to infrastructure, with the focus only on engineering) to a                               replacement and expansion of infrastructure, as well&#13;
more comprehensive strategy with an ever-longer horizon.                                  as sustainability of the environment and the water&#13;
This vision demands institutions to back it up, financial                                 resource itself.&#13;

arrangements with trained local operators, and cooperation                           c) Ratification of the concept of comprehensive&#13;
by the beneficiaries.                                                                   water management. Many communities and local&#13;

developments:                                                                           change on these resources and on the provision of&#13;

       adapted to the specific setting, has been validated.                             over water rights. Furthermore, cultural patterns in&#13;
       There are no universally applicable solutions. The                               certain regions involve specific practices that must be&#13;
       particulars of each case must be analyzed, taking into                           adequately assessed, and initiatives such as payment&#13;
       account experiences and lessons that can be applied                              for environmental services have been proposed.&#13;
       for replication on a larger scale. Despite this progress,&#13;
       however, it is still necessary to convince financing                          d) Promotion of access to sanitation based on equity.&#13;

   iii) Promote the adoption of low water use sanitation                            vi) Relate the investment in sanitation to the local&#13;
        technologies. For example, propose a system of                                  economy. Recognize sanitation infrastructure as&#13;
        incentives to encourage people to save water, or                                increasing a homeâ&#128;&#153;s value and the communityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
        avoid the use of pour-flush latrines when they require                          potential for productive activities, or for generating&#13;
        the use of water from scarce sources or drawn by                                family income (as in the case of tourism, in some&#13;
        pumping, which uses more energy and resources.                                  locations).&#13;
&#13;
   iv) Promote supply and demand for sanitation&#13;
       services with private sector participation. New                           Challenge 2: the demand-based approach:&#13;
       approaches for marketing strategies to promote rural                      thinking beyond theÂ project cycle&#13;
       sanitation, such as Peruâ&#128;&#153;s experiences (bathrooms                         A decade ago, we began to see the results of a demand-based&#13;
       that drain on-site to percolation pits or septic                          approach, where priority was given to rural drinking water&#13;
       tanks, or tanks that do not use water for ecological                      projects in communities willing to contribute to and take&#13;
       sanitation) and drainage into septic ditches in                           an active part in the implementation of a new project. This&#13;

          other stakeholders, and provides technical assistance and training&#13;

     scenarios for the implementation of national programs, in                                  approach, such as: i) lack of a policy of coordination among the&#13;
     which sub-national governments have increasingly greater                                   national social programs in order to provide consistency and&#13;
     responsibilities. The assignment and implementation of                                     complementarity in their actions; ii) limited coordination among&#13;
     rural water and sanitation projects, often done by a central                               the community, the municipality, and other stakeholders prior&#13;
     government agency, has focused in the past directly on the                                 to the intervention; iii) lack of inter-sector coordination involving&#13;

     beneficiary communities. There has been great progress in&#13;

partial, since the final objective is sustainable services.                              municipalities have first-hand information on their&#13;

and maintenance of the rural system, the sector initiatives&#13;
are open to local processes. This requires attention by the                              Challenges. The principal challenge is to&#13;
municipal authority, and is reflected in three areas of inter-                           maintain the commitment despite changes in&#13;
vention: promotion, technical assistance, and monitoring.                                mayors, government, and officials, keeping&#13;

    i) Promotion. Promotion is a permanent activity of                                   investments. Other important challenges are to&#13;
       local governments to stimulate demand and share                                   have sufficient financial resources to carry through&#13;
       the financing of the systems. The municipalities can                              with local development plans after financial&#13;
       supplement the central investment with municipal                                  decentralization, to have sufficient local logistical&#13;
       financial contributions and encourage contributions                               capacity to respond to the challenges, and to be&#13;

    ii) Technical assistance. Municipalities, working                                    gathered at the local level.&#13;
        individually or together, can set up a municipal&#13;
        unit or office to provide technical assistance to the                    The pace of consolidation differs from country to country,&#13;
        Water and Sanitation Service Boards (JASS) and                           however, and in many cases sub-national and local&#13;
        specialized operators of local services: to do repair                    governments need to improve their technical capacities&#13;
        and maintenance jobs that are beyond the capacity of                     and human resources. In some municipalities the rural&#13;

        sources of financing to expand sustainable coverage;                     management and execution will need to tilt its efforts&#13;
        and, in this context, to complement rural water                          toward the rural areas. In other cases, there may be a high&#13;
        and sanitation projects with other development                           percentage of rural population in a municipality where the&#13;
        processes (health, education, rural development) in                      municipal government has very limited management and&#13;
        coordination with the municipal government.                              execution capacity. National rural water and sanitation&#13;
                                                                                 programs have an opportunity to address these limitations&#13;
    iii) Follow-up and monitoring. The municipalities                            head on and include strengthening of the municipal level to&#13;
         can design local information systems, connected to                      provide sustainable services to the rural communities.&#13;
         the sub-national and national levels, to record and&#13;
         update data on local services and provide accurate and                  To improve coordination with the municipal government&#13;
         reliable information for programming investments.                       to promote sustainability of rural water and sanitation,&#13;
                                                                                 it is necessary to strengthen connections between that&#13;
It was noted that the municipal role has clear advantages                        government and the rural drinking water boards or&#13;
and challenges:                                                                  committees. In some cases, such as in Paraguay and&#13;
                                                                                 Honduras, the associations of boards assume an important&#13;
        Advantages. The municipalities have direct contact                       leadership role that can lead to a larger contribution and&#13;
        with the population and thoroughly understand its                        municipal support.&#13;

         ii) Ensure monitoring and follow-up. Especially                                             In this framework, Boliviaâ&#128;&#153;s regulatory entity seeks alignment and&#13;
                                                                                                     harmonization of the communities with municipal governments for&#13;
             in the case of new investments or projects, the&#13;

             participation by the federal and state governments)&#13;
             after conclusion of the project. This will also make&#13;
             it possible to lay the basis for sustained community&#13;
             participation beyond the end of the project.&#13;

    iii) Foster closer alignment between local and&#13;
         national stakeholders. The municipal government                                      Rural drinking water projects that strengthen&#13;
                                                                                              decentralization in Nicaragua9&#13;
         can strengthen and complement the vision of&#13;
         national institutions and adopt mechanisms to                                        The Social Investment Fund (FISE) traditionally applied a&#13;
                                                                                              centralized project execution model in which the works were&#13;
         align municipal strategies with the sub-national&#13;
                                                                                              directly implemented in the communities without strengthening&#13;
         and national principles and sector policies, such                                    the municipal capacities; execution of the work was all done by&#13;
         as: funding mechanisms, counterparts, subsidies,                                     consultants or the rural aqueduct directorates. Efforts to elicit&#13;
         tariff regimes, etc. For their part, national entities                               social participation were not oriented toward sustainability,&#13;
         can promote mechanisms for consultation                                              because there was no gender policy and no system for&#13;
                                                                                              environmental management. Initially, priority was given to rapid&#13;
         and participation in decision making from the&#13;
                                                                                              execution of the work, without ensuring the installation of local&#13;
         sub-national levels.                                                                 capacity. As a result, in many cases the systems failed for lack&#13;
                                                                                              of social or technical sustainability.&#13;
    iv) Improve water resource management. Municipal&#13;
                                                                                              The new FISE, responsible for the rural sub-sector, is&#13;
        and sub-national governments also play an&#13;
                                                                                              implementing a new model to provide rural water and sanitation.&#13;
        important role in addressing issues outside the                                       The new strategyâ&#128;&#153;s principles are strengthening of the sector&#13;
        community, such as the protection of natural                                          approach of interventions and promotion of coordination&#13;
        springs and the uniting of efforts for water resource                                 with the other sectors, strengthening of local capacities and&#13;
        management. In Brazil, federal policies contribute                                    decentralization, social and technical sustainability of projects,&#13;
                                                                                              and integration of the water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion&#13;
        directly to these objectives.&#13;
                                                                                              components.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              The new model also emphasizes the importance of community-&#13;
                                                                                              driven projects. Nevertheless, experience shows that the&#13;
                                                                                              mere participation of the community does not ensure&#13;
                                                                                              sustainability, because that depends on the process used by&#13;
                                                                                              the implementation model. We found that follow-up by the&#13;
                                                                                              municipality for six months following the projectâ&#128;&#153;s conclusion&#13;
                                                                                              helps to ensure the sustainability of the works.&#13;

Working in rural sanitation, it is key to bear in mind the components&#13;
ofÂ education, environment, and health.&#13;

     Challenge 4: Sector policy                                                       sector policy for rural water and sanitation, separate and&#13;
     and ï¬?nancial policy for rural water                                              distinct from public policies that address issues of urban&#13;
     andÂ sanitation: pending issues                                                   water and sanitation.&#13;
     Despite the various reforms and institutional development&#13;
     that occurred in many countries in the last decade, the                          During the Cusco+10 analysis it was noted that there is&#13;
     policy commitment by the various governments in the                              still a need for institutional adjustments for coordination&#13;
     region is still very uneven.                                                     among government agencies that may be promoting&#13;
                                                                                      conflicting incentives, and there are still weaknesses&#13;
     Generally speaking, sector policy for rural services continues                   in the legal regulations. They recognized that approval&#13;
     to have a low profile in the priorities for government public                    and implementation of policies can have a high social&#13;
     policies. This is due in part to the tendency to lump rural                      and political costs by involving various institutions and&#13;
     issues in a single effort or policy for rural, agricultural,                     interests, and that elaboration of a policy requires a great&#13;
     or natural resources development. Within the water and                           deal of coordination and agreement, on the one hand, and&#13;
     sanitation sector, the low profile is due to the tendency to                     information along with adequate budgets, on the other.&#13;
     address the complexities of urban systems. Nevertheless,                         Analysis of the topic concluded with identification of some&#13;
     the different context and service unit, the lack of economies                    key elements to be weighed when designing a financial&#13;
     of scale, and challenges for sustainability demand a specific                    policy, summarized in the following table.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ELEMENTS FOR A FINANCIAL POLICY&#13;
&#13;
                                                                 Elements for a ï¬?nancial policy&#13;
&#13;
      General principles             Consider the development of a specific financial policy for rural areas, taking water and sanitation into&#13;
                                     account separately, accompanied by mechanisms for ensuring transparency.&#13;
&#13;
      Financing                      Take into account the co-financing of public investment funds and of those of the community; the latter&#13;
                                     must include self-help. The financing must be consistent with the size of the communities.&#13;
&#13;
      Prioritization                 Clearly identify the priority items to be financed by the government, considering unit costs by level of&#13;
                                     service, community size and service levels.&#13;
&#13;
      Tariffs                        Establish the tariff levels and structure, differentiated tariffs with long-term subsidies, specifying what is&#13;
                                     covered by these tariffs or fees in the operation and maintenance of the service.&#13;
&#13;
      Subsidies                      Establish the criteria for allocating and promoting subsidies, considering the subsidizing of supply&#13;
                                     (investment) and of consumption, taking into account the possibility of community subsidies based on level&#13;
                                     of poverty. Also analyze the continuity and sustainability of the subsidy over the long term.&#13;
&#13;
      Incentives                     Propose incentives tied to the investment with a view to ensuring efficient management, setting&#13;
                                     performance indicators for the operators and the use of micrometers. Establish community economic&#13;
                                     participation percentages in the preinvestment stage.&#13;
&#13;
      Institution building           Create local management capabilities, including training for formation of microenterprises (as revenue&#13;
                                     generators), and training for risk prevention.&#13;

   equipment replacement for rural drinking water systems are taken                    There are different definitions of quality of service that have to be&#13;
   into account. The average monthly fixed charge payable by a rural                   analyzed and integrated into the approach adopted, namely that&#13;
   drinking water user is US$3.50 for an average monthly consumption                   of the citizenry (communities, users); that of the principal (Ministry&#13;
   of 10Â m3. For the poorest households, the State pays a 50Â percent                   of Public Works [MOP], other public institutions); and that of the&#13;
   subsidy up to 15 m3, while for households declared to be in extreme                 service provider (sanitation enterprises, MOP, others). The approach&#13;
   poverty (Chile Solidario Program) the subsidy is 100Â percent, up to                 is angled toward continuous improvement by incorporating the&#13;

     gathering the basic information that will be useful for both                                  environment; improving the sanitation service, especially through&#13;
     the local government and its governing authority. At the                                      research on technology adapted to the needs and conditions of&#13;
     local government level, the information and existing data                                     users; and mobilizing greater investment in rural sanitation, all&#13;
     collection methods should be useful for reducing costs, and                                   of which are essential to preventing contamination of the supply&#13;
     hence for decision making.                                                                    and improving services to the community. In the future, SENASA&#13;

     that enables sequential gathering and validation of the                                       Associations so that the management of the services provided&#13;
     information on the basis of indicators that make it easy for                                  by the JAS will be enhanced by incorporating gender and youth&#13;

     the municipal technical units and the water committees&#13;
     to ascertain the status of their coverages at the municipal&#13;
     and community levels. The system will need to contain&#13;
     basic information such as coverage, continuity, quality,&#13;
     use, type, and assistance in technical and social topics,&#13;

   iii) Monitoring systems. There is the need to set up                                       monitoring at the community level by the agencies that operate&#13;
        monitoring systems that are appropriate for the                                       the service, with a view to controlling the cost of managing the&#13;
        boards, the municipalities and the governing bodies.                                  systems, their useful life, and their efficiency.&#13;
        There are various examples of monitoring systems&#13;
        designed for individual projects, but what is needed&#13;
        is a more complete system for monitoring and&#13;
        strengthening the sustainability of rural services over&#13;
        the long term.&#13;

&#13;
     At the beginning of the 21st century, one of the key                            During the past decade, new topics and opportunities have&#13;
     approaches to securing sustainable water and rural                              also been introduced, together with the recognition of what&#13;
     sanitation services was to promote demand-based service                         still remains to be done to consolidate a rural water supply&#13;
     delivery in the framework of a participative process. The                       and sanitation sector that could systematically improve the&#13;
     first workshop in 1999, Improvement of the Sustainability                       sustainability of rural basic services. The in-depth collec-&#13;
     of Water and Sanitation Projects in Rural Areas, was also                       tive consideration that took place at the seminar on The&#13;
     focused on seeking to draw lessons from projects planned                        Challenges of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation a&#13;
     and implemented.                                                                Decade Later (Cusco+10) was aimed at identifying the new&#13;

     A decade later, at the Cusco+10 Seminar, considerable                           sustainability of rural basic sanitation; ii)Â  implementing&#13;
     progress was observed in the effectiveness of rural drinking                    the demand-based approach beyond the project cycle;&#13;
     water projects, and also in the favorable impacts of the                        iii)Â  continuing to support municipal decentralization;&#13;
     demand-based approach. The figures regarding access to                          iv)Â  supporting the sector policy and financial policy for&#13;
     drinking water in rural areas have risen (although much still                   resolving the outstanding issues in water supply and sanita-&#13;
     remains to be learned about the population) and there is                        tion; and finally; v)Â tying the long-term sustainability of the&#13;
     now greater acceptance of the need to involve the municipal                     services to local monitoring systems that facilitate timely,&#13;

            This report summarizes the current
            context of the water and rural sanitation sub-sector and the
            analysis thereof undertaken at the Cusco+10 seminar. The
            first part of the report, basic rural services at the end of
            the 20th century, summarizes the situation as it stood in
            the 1990s and the conclusions reached at the 1999 seminar
            workshop. The second part, Trends in the first decade of the
            21st century, identifies some of the new variables that have
            emerged and are shaping the context as work continues toward
            establishing sustainable services. The third part,
            challenges for the next decade, reports the findings from
            the Cusco plus 10 analyses and sums them up in five major
            challenges to be addressed. Finally, the fourth part,
            conclusions, looks to the future and suggests some new
            trends that are affecting the five major cross-cutting themes.
