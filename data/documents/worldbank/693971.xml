BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - MARANHAO&#13;
1.   RURAL POVERTY IN BRAZIL, THE NORTHEAST AND MARANHAO&#13;
THE RURAL POOR AND THE ECONOMY&#13;
1.1   The rural and regional dimension of poverty in Brazil is well documented. About&#13;
50 percent of the Brazilian poor live in rural areas, and the incidence of poverty among the&#13;
rural population is more than double that in large cities and urban areas. Economic&#13;
instability over the past two decades was a major obstacle to redressing rural poverty, the&#13;
chief cause of which is the lack of human and physical assets in poor households. Real&#13;
economic growth fell from 9% annually in the 1970s to 2.7% in the 1980s, and for more&#13;
than a decade there was little improvement in standards of living. Economic and sectoral&#13;
policies did not provide support for sustainable investment, and as a consequence savings&#13;
fell, inflation accelerated and consumer prices increased as much as 30% a month.&#13;
Austerity programs associated with different adjustment attempts between 1986 and 1994&#13;
cut back investment for rural development, in particular for primary education, targeted&#13;
health interventions, rural roads, water supply and small farmer agricultural services.&#13;
Migration from rural areas in the 1980s and early 1990s--motivated by unemployment,&#13;
underemployment and lack of social and other services--created an enormous new burden&#13;
on urban centers, and underscored the urgency of addressing rural poverty to stem its&#13;
conversion into an urban pcverty phenomenon.&#13;
1.2   Since the introduction of the Plano Real in mid-1994, a large degree of&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization has been achieved, with the annual inflation rate reduced to a&#13;
fraction of its former level (currently around 10%-I 1% p.a.). However, in the short to&#13;
medium termi, stabilization also implies a very strong fiscal adjustment with tightening of&#13;
government expenditures, high real interest rates and, hence, a deepening of the&#13;
investment pause in the firm and rural sector. The consequences in terms of rural&#13;
employment and lack of social services continue to be serious, and clearly call for&#13;
offsetting safety net actions. While successful macroeconomic adjustment should promote&#13;
longer-term economic growth with benefits extending to rural areas, international&#13;
experience shows that targeted programs and policies for the socio-economic development&#13;
of the poor remain an essential complement to the adjustment process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

RURAL POVERTY IN THE NORTHEAST&#13;
1.3   The Northeast has long constituted the single largest area of rural poverty in Latin&#13;
America. This Region, covering nine states and part of a tenth, accounts for 190/o of&#13;
Brazil's total land area and almost 30% of its 148 million population (1993). More than&#13;
half of all Brazilian poor, and almost two-thirds of the country's rural poor, live in the&#13;
Northeast where, according to a World Bank Poverty Assessment in Brazil, annual per&#13;
capita incomes of rural inhabitants reach only US$230 (less than one-tenth of the national&#13;
average).' Among the underlying causes of rural poverty in the Northeast are the&#13;
relatively poor resource base of large parts of the region and variable agro-climatic&#13;
conditions which make them vulnerable to drought. Skewed access to land and the virtual&#13;
absence of a functioning rural financial system for the poor are additional constraints.&#13;
Northeast agriculture is characterized by limited input use and slow rates of technology&#13;
adoption. Productivity is low, with output per farm worker less than half that of other&#13;
regions. Overall Northeast agricultural GDP growth was negligible during 1991-1994,&#13;
and was less than 1% in 1995.&#13;
1.4   About 40% of the Northeast's rural population lives in the interior semi-arid zone&#13;
characterized by poor soils and severe, cyclical and often protracted drought. The&#13;
"drought polygon" in the semi-arid region includes most of Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte,&#13;
Paraiba, Piaui and Bahia, and smaller proportions of all the other Northeastern states&#13;
except Maranhao. The remainder of the rural population lives in areas which are generally&#13;
more humid and have better soils, the coastal belt and the drought-prone transitional zone&#13;
between the coast and the semi-arid area. The rural economy revolves around food crops&#13;
including fruits and vegetables, and extensive irrigated commercial export cropping and&#13;
livestock grazing by larger farmers. As a consequence of limitations imposed by uncertain&#13;
climate and market fluctuations, the rural poor in the Northeast, comprising small farm&#13;
owners, tenants, sharecroppers and landless laborers rely on a complex of activities&#13;
including the subsistence cropping of basic foods and small-scale animal husbandry, cash&#13;
crops (mainly cotton and cashew), casual agricultural and non-agricultural work, and&#13;
remittances from family members living in cities.&#13;
1.5   Health and social indicators attest to the poor quality of life in the Northeast,&#13;
compared to the rest of Brazil. The region has: (a) a rate of chronic malnutrition of&#13;
children under five at 27% and, in the rural areas, 31%, compared to 15% nationwide; (b)&#13;
57% of households without piped water supply, reaching 91% in the rural areas,&#13;
compared to 28% nationwide; (c) 30% of households without electricity, more than&#13;
doubling to 67% in the rural areas, compared to 13% nationwide; and (d) 73% of all&#13;
households and 96% of rural households lacking access to proper sanitation facilities,&#13;
compared to 46% nationwide.2&#13;

1.6   Public investment in the Northeast in basic infrastructure --particularly in&#13;
transport, electrification and water supply-- has declined dramatically in the past 25 years&#13;
because of economic recession and fiscal crisis.3 The annual growth rate of public capital&#13;
investment in the region was 9.6% in the period 1970-80, 3.1% in 1980-90, but a minus&#13;
1.5% in 1990-94. The distribution of public investment between the Federal, State and&#13;
municipal governments, has also evolved significantly since the early 1980s. Comparing&#13;
the period 1970-80 to 1990-93, the contribution of the Federal Government to total&#13;
capital investment expenditure in the Northeast dropped from 58% to 47% while that of&#13;
municipal governments more than doubled from 90/o to 190/o. The State governments'&#13;
share remained practically constant at 33-34%. In 1994, investments by the Federal and&#13;
State Governments increased marginally to 51% and 33%, respectively, while the share of&#13;
the municipal governments dropped to around 16%. The proposed project would help&#13;
compensate for the lack of public investment expenditure in the Northeast. The project&#13;
would also reflect the shift in investment expenditure shares from the Federal Government&#13;
to municipal governments by concentrating resource allocation decisions for subproject&#13;
investments at the municipal level and by leveraging resources of municipal governments&#13;
to increase investment in poor rural areas.&#13;
1.7   The proposed project would also be a natural complement to important changes in&#13;
the political economy of Brazil that were brought about by the Federal Constitution of&#13;
1988. Fiscal resources, priority setting and program implementation responsibilities have&#13;
been increasingly decentralized from the Federal Government to the states, municipalities&#13;
and local populations. This encouraging trend should help avoid many of the financial and&#13;
managerial problems which generations of Northeast poverty programs encountered under&#13;
centralized coordination and implementation arrangements. Much of the Bank's dialogue&#13;
and lending for poverty, including in rural development, health and education, has now&#13;
shifted to the states, with the role of the Federal Government being redefined to stress&#13;
more strategic functions, such as broad policy and norm setting and financial transfer&#13;
schemes to improve equity.&#13;
EXPERIENCE WITH PAST BANK LENDiNG&#13;
1.8   The Federal and State Governments have been involved since the early 1970s in&#13;
financing projects to alleviate rural poverty in the Northeast. The World Bank has been&#13;
associated for many years with these efforts, through its financing of a series of programs&#13;
and projects, including area-specific and state rural development projects, various sectoral&#13;
operations and a regional rural development program.&#13;
1.9   Historically, rural development programs in the Northeast have coalesced around&#13;
two themes: drought relief and the integrated development of selected areas. The first&#13;
has involved emergency relief programs or projects to increase the productivity of scarce&#13;
water resources, including large public irrigation schemes. While the budgetary impact of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
these projects has been tremendous, their poverty effects have been limited and often&#13;
temporary. The second approach, that of integrated subregional development programs,&#13;
has included initiatives like the Sertanejo Project and the Bank-financed&#13;
POLONORDESTE projects of the 1970s and early 1980s.&#13;
1.10 POLONORDESTE. The POLONORDESTE operations concentrated on&#13;
specific nicroregions within each of the nine Northeast states and the northern part of&#13;
Minas Gerais. They were comprehensive, multisectoral projects designed to improve&#13;
agricultural efficiency, raise rural incomes and increase employment. They typically&#13;
included components for agricultural modernization (extension, research, credit,&#13;
marketing, land administration), infrastructure (rural water supply, roads and irrigation)&#13;
and social investments (education, health and community development). Many important&#13;
sectoral initiatives were first piloted under the POLONORDESTE projects: farm&#13;
management extension techniques; integrated farm unit research for small-scale&#13;
agriculture, rather than crop-based research; a wide range of land redistribution initiatives&#13;
and modern land titling technologies; educational curriculum and school calendar reforms&#13;
for rural areas; and community-based primary health care schemes.&#13;
1.11 Nevertheless, evaluation of POLONORDESTE by the Bank in the early 1980s&#13;
showed that, in the aggregate, they had only a limited impact on poverty. The micro-&#13;
regions supported by the Bank projects were relatively small areas in the context of the&#13;
whole Northeast; poverty targeting mechanisms were weak; and delivery mechanisms&#13;
relied exclusively on Federal and state bureaucracies. The Federal Government frequently&#13;
failed to provide adequate counterpart funds and delayed the release of budgeted amounts,&#13;
with damaging effects on the projects given Brazil's chronically high inflation.&#13;
Consequently, less than one-third of project funds reached intended beneficiaries, as&#13;
seriously reduced budgets were absorbed by administration and overheads.&#13;
1.12 Sectoral Loans and the Northeast Rural Development Program. These&#13;
considerations prompted the Bank and Federal Government to change strategies in the&#13;
mid-1980s. On the one hand, the lessons learned from some of the pilot efforts under&#13;
POLONORDESTE were promising, but it was felt that these needed to be expanded&#13;
geographically and supported by broader sector policy reforms, within the framework of&#13;
single-sector operations unencumbered by the coordination and implementation difficulties&#13;
of multiple components. A series of sectoral operations, such as Northeast land titling,&#13;
education, health, and irrigation, resulted in the next few years.&#13;
1.13  With respect to integrated rural development, this was still considered to be a&#13;
viable and necessary approach but, again, it was felt that the effort should be expanded&#13;
statewide in order to have a broader impact, and that the number of components should be&#13;
drastically reduced. As a result, in 1985, the Northeast Rural Development Program&#13;
(NRDP) was established to alleviate rural poverty and improve the living standards of&#13;
small farn families in the Northeast. Under this program, the Bank approved during&#13;
1985-87 individual loans for the ten states in an amount totaling US$826.7 million. But,&#13;
through 1993, with the exception of one component supporting small community projects&#13;
(known as the APCR), implementation of the NRDP lagged behind schedule and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
performance in meeting basic objectives was weak. Some of the main causes were quite&#13;
similar to the causes of poor performance under the earlier POLONORDESTE projects:&#13;
chronic fiscal deficits and other macroeconomic distortions led to almost constant&#13;
counterpart funding shortages and widespread deterioration of many of the public&#13;
institutions responsible for carrying out the NRDP. The Federal Government devolved&#13;
some responsibilities to the states, but, by and large, institutional arrangements were still&#13;
highly centralized. Decision-making, administration and financing arrangements were&#13;
generally non-participatory, and the sense of project "ownership" at both state and local&#13;
levels was limited.&#13;
1.14 On the other hand, the innovative APCR community-based components (para.&#13;
1.13), which stressed community organization and relied on local planning and&#13;
implementation, were noticeably more successful. They acknowledged the expressed&#13;
needs of the communities, their poverty alleviation impact was positive, the cost per family&#13;
relatively low, and disbursement and commitment rates far exceeded those of other&#13;
components.&#13;
1.15 Reformulated NRDP. On the Bank's initiative, in 1993 the NRDP was&#13;
reformulated and transformed into a community-based development program, drawing&#13;
both on the successful experience of the APCR small community projects component and&#13;
on lessons learned with similar schemes elsewhere in Latin America, particularly the&#13;
Mexican Solidaridad program. Performance has been positive. Rural communities&#13;
participated in the identification, financing and implementation of subprojects that met&#13;
their most pressing needs, increased their sense of project ownership, and had a much&#13;
sharper focus on poverty alleviation. The reformulated NRDP covered all members of&#13;
poor rural communities and not only those with productive assets, and based on a&#13;
'matching grant" mechanism linked to beneficiary contributions towards subproject cost.&#13;
The State Governments were fully responsible for counterpart funding, and the&#13;
corresponding sense of "ownership" of the program increased over time.&#13;
1.16 Based on implementation in the approximately three years since reformulation, as&#13;
well as the earlier experience of the APCR components, certain facts are now clear. The&#13;
program generated unprecedented enthusiasm among beneficiaries and favorable multiplier&#13;
effects--with replicability evident in other programs--and mobilized additional funds from&#13;
municipalities and communities. As much as 93% of disbursements reached targeted&#13;
beneficiaries, and diversion of funds for non-intended uses was much reduced compared to&#13;
past programs. The NRDP's participatory approach induced greater community&#13;
organization and empowerment, increased transparency, and demonstrated that rural&#13;
communities can influence the allocation and use of resources at the municipal level to&#13;
alleviate poverty. Investments funded by the program were of satisfactory quality and less&#13;
costly than those executed by public agencies. While the reformulated program was not&#13;
expected to change the basic agricultural economy in the Northeast, it successfully&#13;
reached a large number of landless families and land reform beneficiaries. Several field&#13;
investigations, surveys and studies have assessed the impact of NRDP. The consensus,&#13;
from a broad sample of completed and operational subprojects, is that they have had a&#13;
positive impact on the quality of life, and in the case of productive subprojects, on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
employment and incomes of beneficiaries. In so doing, the NRDP initiated a process of&#13;
local accumulation and, albeit still on a small scale, elevated the socio-economic standards&#13;
of beneficiary communities that will progressively allow them to enter formal market&#13;
channels. Additionally, the program, by providing essential infrastructure and social&#13;
services to these communities, relieved some of the budgetary burden of the Northeast&#13;
states and municipalities. A summary evaluation of the reformulated NRDP is provided in&#13;
Annex B.&#13;
THE STATE OF MARANHAO&#13;
1.17 The State of Maranhao covers a territory of 333,365 km2 making it the second&#13;
largest state in the Northeast and eighth largest in Brazil, and is bordered by the States of&#13;
Piaui, Para and Tocantins on the east, west and south, respectively. In contrast to the rest&#13;
of the region, most of Maranhao lies outside the semi-arid "drought polygon" and drought&#13;
is an infrequent phenomenon. Lying in a transition zone between the semi-arid Northeast&#13;
and the tropical Amazon, average annual rainfall ranges from 2,500 mm in the northwest&#13;
of the state, to 1,600 mm in the northeast and center, and to 1,200 mm in the south.&#13;
Reflecting this rainfall pattern, the vegetation varies from tropical forest in the northwest,&#13;
to babassu (native palm) in the central areas and to the shrublands of the cerrado&#13;
(elevated plains) in the south.&#13;
1.18 Certain indicators illustrate the socioeconomic predicament of Maranhao's 4.9&#13;
million inhabitants (1991). According to the Mapa da Fome, about half the population is&#13;
considered indigent, i.e., lacks the income to meet minimum nutritional requirements, and&#13;
three-quarters of all indigent persons are rural dwellers, the highest proportion of all the&#13;
Northeastern states. Further, a joint study by UNICEF and IBGE revealed that 91% of all&#13;
municipalities in Maranhao harbor precarious living conditions critically affecting&#13;
childhood survival. More specifically, some 61% of total heads of households (66% in&#13;
rural areas) have a monthly income less than or equivalent to one minimum wage&#13;
(currently about US$120); and illiteracy affects 32% of the total population over 14 years&#13;
of age and 39/o of the rural population (1991). About 60% of Maranhio's total&#13;
population lives in rural areas -a proportion that is considerably higher than in most other&#13;
Northeast states but down from 80% a decade earlier-- where access to basic&#13;
infrastructure and services is grossly inadequate. Some 66% of rural households lack&#13;
access to proper sanitation facilities, and 86% have inadequate access to safe water&#13;
(1991).&#13;
1.19 The high rates of indigence in a state not constrained by semi-arid and drought&#13;
conditions demonstrates the complex determinants of poverty in the Northeast. Rural&#13;
poverty in Maranhiao is closely correlated with a highly-skewed pattern of land ownership,&#13;
insecurity of land tenure and high rents which have promoted migration and generated&#13;
conflict. Agriculture is dominated by extensive livestock enterprises and the production of&#13;
traditional food and commercial crops. The rural poor are primarily smallholders,&#13;
sharecroppers and wage workers, who depend on a diverse strategy of income-generating&#13;
activities in which the subsistence production of maize, beans, manioc and rice&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
predominates. Access to basic services is extremely limited. Small farmers lack modem&#13;
production technology and basic infrastructure to store harvests to take advantage of&#13;
cyclical price fluctuations. Their resulting heavy dependence on middlemen for the sale of&#13;
limited surpluses depresses their returns. Family income is accordingly highly variable&#13;
with little opportunity for savings.&#13;
1.20  Amerindian Peoples. An estimated 13,600 indigenous people live in 16&#13;
Indigenous Reservations in Maranhao. All but two of these reservations (Krikati and Awa&#13;
Guaya) have to date been demarcated and registered. As in many cases of contact&#13;
between ethnic groups and national society, a pattern of ethnic deterioration has&#13;
characterized the history of such contacts in the State of Maranhao. Since the&#13;
establishment of the federal Law of the Indian in 1973, the Foundation for Amerindian&#13;
Affairs (FUNAI) has coordinated the Federal Government's efforts to protect indigenous&#13;
peoples in Brazil, providing assistance in the form of reservations, intermediation with&#13;
national society, health and education services. Political changes in the last decade have&#13;
challenged FUNAI's traditional role and prompted administrative reform of the agency.&#13;
The Federal Constitution of 1988, under Article 231, established the principle of self-&#13;
determination for indigenous peoples and their autonomy in defining the type of&#13;
relationship they wished to maintain with national society, but this Article still awaits final&#13;
ratification. The reformulated NRDP in Maranhao was instrumental in fostering the civil&#13;
autonomy of the state's indigenous population and promoting interaction with society&#13;
through the FUMAC component, which led to the consolidation of indigenous councils --&#13;
formed from independent indigenous associations-- and their assuming the role of&#13;
managers of resources destined for them. In the indigenous FUMAC Council in Barra do&#13;
Corda for example, members evaluate the viability of subproject proposals and contract&#13;
technical assistance providers for the elaboration and execution of community proposals&#13;
using culturally-attuned methods. Results have been quite positive. This methodology&#13;
and management model is particularly suited to groups of communities which traditionally&#13;
practice collective decision-making on socially relevant matters and the delegation of&#13;
powers.&#13;
1.21  State Government Strategy to Alleviate Poverty. In its strategy for sustainable&#13;
development for the period 1996-1999, the State of Maranhao focuses on reducing&#13;
inequalities in the geographic and social distribution of wealth. As part of its strategy to&#13;
alleviate poverty, the State's priorities are to: (a) provide technical and financial&#13;
incentives for small producers and entrepreneurs to contribute to employment generation;&#13;
(b) increase the supply and affordability of basic food products; (c) increase the&#13;
population's access to basic health services; (d) invest in greatly improving the social&#13;
indicators for infant mortality, illiteracy, life expectancy, sanitation and housing; (e)&#13;
systematically reduce grade repetition and school drop-out rates; (f) expand training&#13;
opportunities to upgrade the technical and professional caliber of the labor force; (g)&#13;
mobilize governmental and non-governmental organizations for the eradication of misery&#13;
and hunger in the state; (h) ensure democratic access to information as an instrument for&#13;
improving community organizations and their management capabilities; and (i) diversify&#13;
and decentralize economic activity in order to exploit the potential of local communities&#13;
and to establish more efficient methods for distributing services. The State Government is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
mindful of the lessons of the reformulated NRDP, which stressed decentralization, popular&#13;
participation and administrative transparency.&#13;
1.22 Experience with Previous Bank Rural Development Projects in Maranhio.&#13;
Maranhlo's performance under Bank-financed projects prior to the 1993 NRDP&#13;
reformulation was generally consistent with that of the other Northeastern states (paras.&#13;
1.8 to 1.16). Under the POLONORDESTE program (1970s and early 1980s), the&#13;
Maranhao Rural Development Project (Loan 2177-BR) met its physical targets but&#13;
encountered implementation and disbursement delays stemming from Federal counterpart&#13;
funding and rural credit problems, combined with over-centralized project administration&#13;
and limited beneficiary participation. Nevertheless, the project did strengthen state&#13;
institutional capacity, and established services and infrastructure which lent dynamism to a&#13;
process of agricultural modernization. Under the NRDP-Maranhio up to reformulation,&#13;
overall performance did not notably improve, but the community-based rural development&#13;
methodology was successfully launched under the APCR component.&#13;
1.23 The NRDP-Maranhao project closed on December 31, 1996, after a three-month&#13;
extension of the original closing date. Under the reformulated program, Maranhao's&#13;
performance improved markedly, especially in the final year, due to strong support from&#13;
the State Government and the municipalities. Whereas loan disbursements in this state&#13;
reached only US$22.8 million during the entire implementation period of the original&#13;
NRDP (1985 to end-1993), they more than doubled in the approximately three years&#13;
ensuing reformulation (end-1993 to end-1996) to total US$57.4 million by loan closing,&#13;
leaving a balance for cancellation of US$3.8 million. Indeed, the annual rate of&#13;
disbursements after reformulation evolved dramatically, rising from US$1.2 million in&#13;
1993 to US$30.0 million in 1996. More importantly, by loan closing rural community&#13;
associations had submitted some 6,240 subproject proposals, of which about 3,100 were&#13;
implemented, benefiting 318,760 poor rural families (including 2,100 Amerindian&#13;
families), as compared to reformulation targets of 1,600 subprojects and beneficiary&#13;
families of 32,000. Some 65% of the approved investments under the reformulated NRDP&#13;
were infrastructure subprojects, 30% were productive and 5% were social subprojects.&#13;
MAIN LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE NORTHEAST RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
(NRDP)&#13;
1.24 The World Bank has 20 years of experience in supporting rural development and&#13;
poverty alleviation in Northeast Brazil, starting with the POLONORDESTE Program&#13;
(1975-84), a variety of sectoral projects and more recently with the NRDP (1985 to the&#13;
present). The NRDP, following its reformulation in 1993, focused entirely on client-&#13;
driven subproject investments implemented by the communities themselves, with&#13;
decentralized project management at the state and municipal levels and more transparent&#13;
decision-making and accountability for project performance. Implementation has provided&#13;
important lessons for the proposed project (see Annex B for further details):&#13;
(a)   Decentralization of fiscal and investment decision-making from Federal to&#13;
state and local governments ensures more efficient project administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
Decentralization of resource allocation and investment decisions to&#13;
municipalities and communities should be accompanied by a dearly defined&#13;
and well-disseminated system of incentives and penalties to discourage the&#13;
misuse of fimds;&#13;
(b)   Poverty-targeting mechanisms should be simple, explicit and&#13;
monitorable; be based on objective criteria; foster transparency and&#13;
muinimize political interference in project resource allocation; and ensure&#13;
that project resources do reach the poorest communities;&#13;
(c)   Participation in the financing of subprojects generates a sense of&#13;
ownership and a willingness to share responsibility for the future operation&#13;
and maintenance of project investments. Beneficiary participation in the&#13;
selection, execution, supervision and financing of project investments&#13;
ensures that investments respond to true, perceived needs, generates cost&#13;
savings and increases accountability at the local level; the organization of&#13;
poor communities heightens their awareness of available programs and&#13;
services, facilitates their participation and increases subproject cost-&#13;
effectiveness;&#13;
(d)   Sustainability of project investments has greater potential when the&#13;
municipalities and communities contribute to subproject financing in a cost-&#13;
sharing arrangement and when there is increased beneficiary participation.&#13;
For example, the participatory process introduced in the pilot Municipal&#13;
Council component (FUMAC) of the reformulated NRDP ensured better&#13;
selection and prioritization of subprojects by beneficiaries. Sustainability is&#13;
also promoted when communities themselves assume greater&#13;
responsibilities and continue to voice their demands in a concrete fashion to&#13;
influence public investment expenditure at the local level;&#13;
(e)   A widely disseminated and carefully designed information campaign is&#13;
essential to ensure transparency and proper knowledge of the program's&#13;
objectives and contents by all potential beneficiaries;&#13;
(f)    Technical assistance should be accessible to rural communities to enable&#13;
them to identify, prepare and implement their own subprojects, thereby&#13;
augmenting their capacity to compete for investment funds. Technical&#13;
assistance should also be targeted to weaker municipalities to improve their&#13;
planning, management and financial capacity; and, the quality of the Project&#13;
Coordinating Unit (PCU), whether it provides technical assistance directly&#13;
or through partner entities, is a critical factor in project success and may&#13;
entail the contracting of local and/or international organizations to&#13;
strengthen its institutional capacities;&#13;
(g)   Standardization of subproject documents, technical designs and unit&#13;
costs simplifies the subproject preparation and evaluation process,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
facilitates the procurement of goods and works, prevents overdesign and&#13;
improves the quality of subprojects, thereby encouraging greater&#13;
participation by poorer communities and reducing bottlenecks in the&#13;
subproject cycle;&#13;
(h)   Supervision, both during and after subproject implementation, is an&#13;
indispensable determinant of success and sustainability. It has to be&#13;
reinforced at all levels and involve local entities closest to the communities,&#13;
particularly Municipal Councils and NGOs;&#13;
(i)    A user-friendly monitoring and evaluation system facilitates the&#13;
subproject evaluation process, provides feedback and necessary&#13;
information to improve targeting and efficiency, and is an essential&#13;
management and planning tool. Project design should pay careful attention&#13;
to baseline studies as the springboard for well-designed M&amp;E and for ex-&#13;
post financial and economic evaluation of productive subprojects;&#13;
j)    Productive subprojects financed in a social context should be subject to&#13;
rigorous selection, preparation, technical assistance and supervision.&#13;
Eligible productive investments should be those which provide services for&#13;
a large number of community members; whose collective use is regulated&#13;
by strict operational guidelines (regulamento de uso); and for which&#13;
operation and maintenance is assured by charging adequate user fees to&#13;
both association members and non-members; and&#13;
(k)   Dissemination of "best practices", such as experiences with NGOs in Rio&#13;
Grande do Norte, EMATER in Minas Gerais and with FUMAC Councils&#13;
in Paraiba, through exchanges of information among Technical Units, at&#13;
training seminars and workshops, can hasten learning and reward&#13;
innovation.&#13;
1.25 The design of the proposed Maranhao Rural Poverty Alleviation Project has taken&#13;
into account these lessons, which are consistent in many respects with lessons learned&#13;
elsewhere in Latin America and other regions with similar community-based development&#13;
programs. The project will expand the FUMAC approach and initiate a pilot municipal&#13;
funds program (para. 2.7), to promote decentralization of decision-making and resource&#13;
allocation to municipal and community levels, to relieve the administrative logjam resulting&#13;
from state intervention in the minutiae of subprojects, and to further encourage municipal&#13;
cost-sharing of subprojects. The project will employ a poverty targeting methodology&#13;
based on a series of poverty-related criteria at the municipal, community and beneficiary&#13;
levels, and backed by a strong system of operational checks and balances to thwart&#13;
mistargeting and misappropriation of resources. As a condition of loan effectiveness, an&#13;
improved monitoring and evaluation system will be adopted to reinforce the targeting&#13;
mechanism and to strengthen the management of the subproject cycle (paras. 2.31-2.40).&#13;
Equally important, for simplicity and efficiency in subproject preparation, evaluation and&#13;
supervision, the Project Operational Manual will establish standard subproject designs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
technical and financial parameters, and cost indicators for the most frequently requested&#13;
subprojects. In addition, funds for technical assistance to rural communities and&#13;
municipalities will be facilitated, to actively promote the organization of the poorest areas&#13;
to enable their participation, foster community capacity and empowerment, and encourage&#13;
the active participation ofNGOs and local grassroots organizations. Finally, greater&#13;
emphasis on supervision by the PCU and local entities of community subprojects to be&#13;
funded by the project will be supported with a larger share of Bank financing of the costs&#13;
related to this activity. This would not only secure the quality of project investments but&#13;
also ensure that implementation bottlenecks, if any, are quickly resolved so as to allow&#13;
smooth and successful operation of the subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.   THE PROJECT&#13;
ORIGIN AND RATIONALE FOR BANK IVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1   The proposed project is based on the positive results of the reformulated Northeast&#13;
Rural Development Program (NRDP). Evaluation by the Brazilian Government, FAO/CP&#13;
and the World Bank has confirmed that this program, itself the cuhnination of two decades&#13;
of expenence, succeeded in introducing an effective model for rural poverty alleviation in&#13;
the Northeast. After field-testing the NRDP model for more than three years, the&#13;
Northeast State Governments are developing new projects which would expand its&#13;
coverage. The proposed project in Maranhao would be one of the third group of follow-&#13;
on operations,- succeeding the Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects for Bahia, Ceara and&#13;
Sergipe, which were approved by the Board on June 29, 1995, and similar projects for&#13;
Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte and Piaui, approved on December 12, 1996.&#13;
2.2   Poverty in certain segments of the population, especially in the Northeast and its&#13;
rural areas, continues to be a preoccupation of the Brazilian administration. Because of&#13;
the high incidence of poverty in the Northeast, this region is a priority for public&#13;
development programs. The cornerstone of the Federal Government's effort to combat&#13;
poverty and hunger is the Comunidade Solidlria program, started in early 1995 as a&#13;
broad framework for the coordination of rural and urban poverty programs and projects&#13;
and focusing on municipalities where poverty is most severe. Implementation is&#13;
decentralized, stressing community self-help and local empowerment, and concentrating&#13;
on four main themes: rural development, income and employment generation, food and&#13;
nutrition, and urban services. The proposed Maranhao Rural Poverty Alleviation Project&#13;
is fiflly consistent with this strategy, parts of which draw heavily on the Bank-supported&#13;
NRDP experience in Northeast Brazil (paras. 1.12-1.16).&#13;
2.3   The project is also fully supportive of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) for Brazil, discussed by the Board on June 12, 1997. The new CAS highlights&#13;
poverty reduction as the central objective of the Bank's assistance efforts in Brazil.&#13;
Regional development is targeted as a major means of achieving this objective, with high&#13;
priority for the Northeast, a region selected under the Bank's Strategic Compact for&#13;
enhanced support of rural development. Overall, the Bank will seek stronger sustainability&#13;
of the poverty projects, including increased cost recovery, project designs that increasingly&#13;
target development of the poor and not only poverty relief, and stronger financial&#13;
commitment from the municipal and state governments where these projects would be&#13;
implemented. The design of the proposed project also followed some of the&#13;
recommendations of the previous CAS and its Progress Report (discussed by the Board&#13;
on June 20, 1996), in particular that policy dialogue and lending should be directed to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
states --whose role is fundamental in the provision of infrastructure and social services-&#13;
and that the Bank should support efforts to decentralize and shift expenditure and&#13;
implementation responsibilities from the Federal Government to the states, municipalities&#13;
and local communities. Finally, in accordance with CAS support for Government's&#13;
macroeconomic and structural reforms, the proposed loan will include funds for technical&#13;
assistance to help the State of Maranhao to further identify and implement appropriate&#13;
reform programs to improve its fiscal situation. The proposed project will be an important&#13;
element in meeting the Bank's main objective in Brazil. As the principal donor engaged in&#13;
a sustained, long-term partnership with the Brazilian Government to address rural poverty&#13;
issues in the Northeast, the Bank is particularly well placed to support this next phase of&#13;
development initiatives for Maranhao.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTlVES&#13;
2.4   The project would assist the State Government of Maranhao to alleviate rural&#13;
poverty and its consequences by: (a) providing basic social and economic infrastructure,&#13;
and employment and income-generating opportunities for the rural poor; (b) decentralizing&#13;
resource allocation and decision-making to local levels by supporting community-based&#13;
municipal councils and beneficiary associations in investment planning and&#13;
implementation; (c) leveraging resources mobilized at the community and municipal levels;&#13;
and (d) deepening the creation of social capital that was initiated by the reformulated&#13;
NRDP. The project is expected to lay groundwork for, and consolidate, participatory&#13;
institutions and processes at the municipal and community levels. The project would&#13;
ensure that funds reach the poorest municipalities and communities, and would expand the&#13;
successful strategy of decentralization and participation tested under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP.&#13;
PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
2.5   The proposed project would include three main components, as follows:&#13;
(a) Community Subprojects (US$95.0 million or 90% of total base cost), which would&#13;
support small-scale investments selected and subsequently operated and maintained by the&#13;
beneficiaries themselves; (b) Institutional Development (US$7.4 million or 7% of total&#13;
base cost), which would provide all implementing entities and communities with technical&#13;
assistance and training to increase their capacity and improve implementation of the&#13;
project; and (c) Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$3.1&#13;
million or 3% of total base cost), which would finance project coordination and activities&#13;
to provide feedback on project performance and impact.&#13;
A. Community Subprojects&#13;
2.6   The project would provide matching grants to rural community associations to&#13;
finance small-scale subprojects (up to US$50,000 each) identified by these groups as&#13;
priority investments that would improve community well-being. Subprojects would be of&#13;
many types, broadly classified as infrastructure (such as rural electrification, local road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
improvements and water supply), social (e.g., health-related house improvement, day care&#13;
centers, school or health post rehabilitation) and productive subprojects (such as small-&#13;
scae community agro-processing, communal tractors and minor irrigation schemes).&#13;
Subproject selection is demand-driven and based on community preferences. The project&#13;
would establish a negative list of subproject types ineligible for financing and, for&#13;
productive subprojects in particular, additional and rigorous eligibility criteria.4&#13;
Subproject proposals would observe standard documentation and technical, economic,&#13;
environmental and sustainability criteria established in a detailed Project Operational&#13;
Manual, which sets forth procedures and guidelines for implementation. The Operational&#13;
Manual, based on the manual already in use for the reformulated NRDP project, will&#13;
reflect the lessons learned during the past three years of implementation. During appraisal,&#13;
agreements were reached on the needed improvements to the NRDP Operational Manual.&#13;
During negotiations, the Bank reviewed a complete revised draft of the Operational&#13;
Manual, and assurances were provided by the Borrower that all project components and&#13;
subprojects would be executed in accordance with the Project Operational Manual (para.&#13;
3. l(a)). Adoption of the Operational Manual would be a condition of loan effectiveness&#13;
(para. 3.2(a)).&#13;
2.7   The identification, preparation and implementation of all subprojects financed&#13;
under the project will be the responsibility of the beneficiary rural communities (see paras.&#13;
2.31 to 2.40 for a detailed description of the community subproject cycle). Three different&#13;
delivery mechanisms will distinguish how the subprojects are approved and the respective&#13;
financing arranged:&#13;
(a)    State Community Schemes (PAC). PAC was the original subprojects&#13;
component of the reformulated NRDP. Under PAC, rural communities&#13;
submit their subproject investment proposals directly to the State Project&#13;
Coordinating Unit (PCU). The PCU screens, approves and releases funds&#13;
for subprojects, interacting directly with the beneficiary communities. It is&#13;
expected that up to US$33.3 million equivalent, or 32% of total base costs,&#13;
would be invested under this subcomponent over the five-year project&#13;
implementation period;&#13;
(b)   Municipal Community Schemes (FUMAC). FUMAC was tested and&#13;
proven successful under the reformulated NRDP. In FUMAC, decision-&#13;
makdng on subproject approval is delegated by the State to project&#13;
Municipal Councils, composed of community members and representatives&#13;
of civil society and municipal authorities. The Municipal Councils&#13;
4  Eligible productive subprojects would be those which provide services which benefit a large number&#13;
of community members and for which a fee is charged for operation and maintenance. Productive&#13;
subprojects, as with infiasucture and social subprojects, must be property of the association as a&#13;
whole and not of select members. For each type of productive subproject, a set of operational&#13;
guidelines (regulamnento de uso), developed by the PCU, would be provided to the association and&#13;
must be adopted. In addition, each subproject proposal must identify the source of technical&#13;
assistance for subproject implementation and subsequent operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
prioritize the demands presented by rural communities through local&#13;
consensus-building and approve subprojects, within an indicative annual&#13;
budget, for financing by the PCU. The selection process would be the&#13;
basis of targeting in the project since the communities themselves, through&#13;
their participation in the project Municipal Councils, determine where&#13;
project resources can best be applied based on their first-hand knowledge&#13;
of local investment needs. It is expected that at least US$54.1 million&#13;
equivalent, or 51% of total base costs, would be invested under this&#13;
subcomponent.&#13;
(c)   Pilot Municipal Community Funds (FUMAC-P). This new&#13;
subcomponent would be a pilot variant of FUMAC, in which selected&#13;
Municipal Councils would prioritize and approve subprojects submitted by&#13;
rural communities and then would finance them within the context of an&#13;
annual budget, which the State PCU would delegate to the Municipal&#13;
Councils to manage themselves. This annual budget envelope would be&#13;
allocated to the Municipal Councils according to a distribution formula,&#13;
based on clear and measurable criteria, such as rural population and&#13;
previous year's performance, for implementation of an Annual Operating&#13;
Plan (POA - Piano Operativo Anual) prepared by each Municipal Council&#13;
and approved by the PCU. The Municipal Council would transfer funds to&#13;
beneficiary associations to finance approved community subprojects. It is&#13;
expected that at least US$7.6 million equivalent, or 7% of total base costs,&#13;
would be invested under this subcomponent.&#13;
2.8   Each subcomponent represents a greater degree of decentralization of decision-&#13;
making and resource allocation responsibilities. Moving from PAC to FUMAC to&#13;
FUMAC-P, the control over project investment planning becomes increasingly local and&#13;
rural communities gain greater voice through their representation on the Municipal&#13;
Council as well as through their participation in its decisions. This institutionalization of&#13;
the participatory process would protect it from political fluctuation, and would eventually&#13;
lead to stronger partnerships between communities and Municipal Councils and their&#13;
respective municipal governments in determining the use of public resources.&#13;
2.9   Given the overwhelmingly positive response to FUMAC under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP, it is expected that the need for the PAC subcomponent would diminish over the&#13;
course of project implementation, with the FUMAC and FUMAC-P subcomponents&#13;
gradually expanding. The continued existence of PAC would facilitate participation in the&#13;
project of those communities within municipalities which lack either the capacity or the&#13;
political will to adopt the FUMAC or FUMAC-P approach. When a municipality is well&#13;
organized and receptive to participatory decision-making processes, it enters FUMAC, a&#13;
Municipal Council is formed and resource allocation decisions are made at the local level.5&#13;
5  Under the refornulated NRDP in Maranh3o, 26 FUMAC Municipal Councils were formed. These&#13;
Councils will continue as FUMAC Councils under the proposed project or may be upgraded to&#13;
FUJMAC-P Councils.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
Once the Municipal Council demonstrates effectiveness in prioritization of demands and&#13;
subproject supervision and a capacity to manage resources, the municipality is promoted&#13;
from FUMAC to FUMAC-P, and henceforth the actual resources are administered at the&#13;
local level by the Municipal Council based on locally-determined investment planning.&#13;
Flexibility would be built into the project to reallocate funds among subcomponents to&#13;
accommodate the expansion of FUMAC and FUMAC-P.&#13;
2.10 In compliance with Brazilian law, beneficiaries must form legally-constituted civil&#13;
associations in order to be eligible to receive financing under the project. Disbursements&#13;
to the beneficiary associations would occur through agreements (convenios) with the PCU&#13;
and/or project Municipal Councils. During appraisal, understandings were reached on&#13;
draft model agreements between the PCU, Municipal Councils and community&#13;
associations for the implementation of community subprojects under the FUMAC,&#13;
FUMAC-P and PAC subcomponents. The final model agreements would form part of the&#13;
Project Operational Manual. Beneficiary associations would contribute to subproject&#13;
costs, either in cash, kind or labor, and would be responsible for the operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) of the investments. The minimum level of contributions expected&#13;
from the beneficiaries, municipalities and the State Government would be specified in a&#13;
cost-sharing matrix in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
B. Institutional Development&#13;
2.11 The Institutional Development component (US$7.4 million or 7% of base costs)&#13;
will finance appropriate technical assistance and training in order for each group&#13;
participating in project implementation to acquire the capabilities needed to effectively&#13;
carry out its responsibilities, as well as the contracting of other entities to assist the PCU&#13;
in monitoring, supervision and evaluation tasks (see Annex D). The project will&#13;
consolidate participatory institutions and processes at the municipal and community levels&#13;
through the community subproject approach, described above, in which well-organized&#13;
communities with sound, carefully prepared proposals are provided with financial support&#13;
for investments, and in which FUMAC Municipal Councils which demonstrate effective&#13;
decision-making capacity are promoted to FUMAC-P and rewarded with their own&#13;
investment budget.&#13;
2.12 To encourage this process and to accompany the decentralized implementation&#13;
framework of the project, technical assistance and training would be provided for the&#13;
beneficiary associations, Municipal Councils, and the PCU, as well as other participating&#13;
entities (Annex E). For example, to derive optimal benefits from subproject investments,&#13;
the beneficiary associations will need accessible support for community organization and&#13;
subproject preparation and execution, as well as for training in operation and maintenance&#13;
techniques. The project Municipal Councils will require assistance to orient their decision-&#13;
making on resource allocation among community investments and, in the FUMAC-P pilot&#13;
program, to create capacity for investment planning and financial administration. In&#13;
addition to providing or making available from other sources a wide range of technical and&#13;
managerial advice to the project Municipal Councils and beneficiary associations, the PCU&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
will need training to enhance its own project coordination and supervision skdlls. Also,&#13;
because the fiscal situation of the State affects both project implementation and state&#13;
counterpart funding, technical assistance at the state level is needed to analyze issues&#13;
surrounding the reform of the State and to identify measures to improve the State's&#13;
capacity to address the inherent causes of its fiscal deficit situation. The instruments for&#13;
achieving this capacity building would include a combination of workshops, technical&#13;
exchanges, on-site training, and more traditional technical assistance, drawing upon local&#13;
expertise within the state --local extensionists, technical consultants, universities, NGOs,&#13;
and other local service providers-- as well as national and international technical assistance&#13;
agencies. To this effect, the component would finance consultant services, training&#13;
materials and courses, seminars, workshops, and related operational costs.&#13;
2.13 The implementation of the institutional development component would be&#13;
decentralized, and the provision of and accountability for technical assistance and training&#13;
would occur increasingly at the local level. In particular, project Municipal Councils will&#13;
play a critical role in overseeing the capacity-building activities for community associations&#13;
in their jurisdictions. Municipal Councils, provided with model terms of reference&#13;
prepared by the PCU, would contract technical assistance based on programs agreed with&#13;
the PCU, which would then release funds for that purpose. Institutional development&#13;
activities can be broadly categorized into five areas: (a) mobilization assistance and&#13;
training for participating communities. Organized and contracted by the PCU and&#13;
Municipal Councils, assistance would be provided for the organization and strengthening&#13;
of community associations, identification of viable investments, subproject preparation,&#13;
and operation and maintenance of investments; (b) capacity-building programs for&#13;
Municipal Councils. Organized by the PCU, the programs would include intensive&#13;
training on the role of Municipal Councils, guidelines of the Operational Manual,&#13;
subproject evaluation and supervision and related topics such as environmental assessment&#13;
of subprojects for each Municipal Council under the project, as well as participatory&#13;
planning and financial management training for FUMAC-P Councils; (c) specialized skills&#13;
training for all participating entities. Based on needs, expert advice and "on-the-job&#13;
training" by local providers would be contracted by the PCU, Municipal Councils and&#13;
groups of community associations, in areas such as the use of standard designs,&#13;
monitoring techniques, and financial administration as well as technical support (e.g., for&#13;
groups of community associations on water use); (d) technical assistance for State reform.&#13;
The Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN), through the PCU, will have access to technical&#13;
assistance funds (US$0.5 million or less than 1% of base costs) for consultant services and&#13;
studies required for administrative and other state reforms. During appraisal, agreements&#13;
were reached with the State on the content and implementation arrangements for this&#13;
Technical Assistance subcomponent; and (e) workshops and seminars for the Municipal&#13;
Councils and beneficiary associations, to exchange experience under the project. These&#13;
"best practice" exchanges could also extend to seminars joining all PCUs of the ten&#13;
Northeastern states to disseminate successful experiences across states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
C. Project Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
2.14 This component (US$3.1 million, or 3% of total base costs) would support overall&#13;
project coordination and supervision and would help to strengthen the effectiveness and&#13;
quality of project operations. It would finance the incremental operating costs of the&#13;
PCU, for overall coordination of project activities, and a statewide information campaign&#13;
to disseminate information about the project and its guidelines to all potential beneficiary&#13;
communities, to increase awareness, transparency and participation. For this campaign,&#13;
the project would finance: (a) local technical assistance in the design and development of&#13;
the campaign; and (b) the implementation costs, including posters, leaflets, radio spots and&#13;
videos. The preparation of a statewide information campaign acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.2(b)).&#13;
2.15 Given the importance of supervision to the overall impact of the program, project&#13;
supervision (Annex K) will be intensified under the project and, accordingly, will be&#13;
allocated half of the component's resources (US$1.6 million, or about 1.5% of base&#13;
costs). Project supervision will provide the PCU with the necessary information on&#13;
project performance to make managerial decisions, such as the provision of technical&#13;
assistance or training, the correction of departures from project guidelines, and the&#13;
promotion of project municipalities from FUMAC to FUMAC-P. In line with the&#13;
decentralized implementation of the project, the responsibilities for project supervision at&#13;
the state and local levels will correspond to the PCU and the project Municipal Councils,&#13;
respectively. Supervision activities to be financed under the project include operational&#13;
expenses for field visits and subcontracted services from NGOs and other participating&#13;
agencies.&#13;
2.16 This component would also finance the establishment of a monitoring system,&#13;
including the maintenance and use of a Management Information System (MIS). To&#13;
function as an efficient management tool, the project MIS (Annex H), originally designed&#13;
under the NRDP, would be improved and made more user-friendly and performance-&#13;
oriented. It would contain key technical, financial and socio-economic information on&#13;
subprojects, as well as cost and other physical indicators. MIS-generated project reports,&#13;
including monthly disbursement reports and semi-annual progress reports, would facilitate&#13;
subproject tracking and generate appropriate feedback on project performance. Project&#13;
performance and impact indicators would be regularly updated to take stock of project&#13;
implementation and included in the semi-annual progress reports. A Project&#13;
Implementation Plan and a matrix of Project Performance Indicators were finalized and&#13;
agreed at appraisal. In addition to financing operating costs for monitoring activities, the&#13;
project would finance experts in information technology and project management: (a) to&#13;
imnprove the MIS; and (b) to coilect and analyze data on cost indicators and physical&#13;
parameters from the most frequently approved types of subprojects, so as to calculate a&#13;
range of values for these indicators and to adjust subproject eligibility criteria accordingly.&#13;
These adjustments would then be incorporated into the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
2.17 Finally, the project would finance consultant services to develop and implement&#13;
studies to evaluate the impact of the subprojects and provide feedback to improve project&#13;
operations: (a) annual physical performance reviews, to assess the quality and&#13;
sustainability of common types of subprojects financed by the project, including reviews of&#13;
community-based procurement; (b) an implementation review, carried out at the rnid-term&#13;
of project implementation, which would include beneficiary consultations to generate an&#13;
evaluation of project performance and impact as perceived by the ultimate beneficiaries;&#13;
and (c) a comprehensive impact evaluation, which would include a baseline evaluation to&#13;
establish indicators of socio-economic impact and a final evaluation of the project using&#13;
these indicators. Annex H contains a detailed description of the studies to be financed&#13;
under the project.&#13;
2.18 During negotiations, assurances were provided by the Borrower that: a project&#13;
information and monitoring system, with reports and format agreed with the Bank, would&#13;
be maintained throughout the project period. The Bank would receive monthly&#13;
information on disbursements of project funds and semi-annual reports on subproject&#13;
activities and performance of project investments on July 31 and January 31 of each year&#13;
(para. 3.1(b)); a baseline impact evaluation study would be completed within one year of&#13;
loan effectiveness, a mid-term review would be carried out in the third year of the project,&#13;
and a full impact evaluation would be executed at project completion (para. 3.1(b)). The&#13;
establishment, by the State. of effective project monitoring and evaluation arrangements&#13;
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.2 (c)).&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
2.19 Project Coordinating Unit. The Secretariat of Planning (Secretaria do&#13;
Planejamento - SEPLAN) of the State of Maranhao would implement the project through&#13;
the PCU, represented by the Nuicleo Estadual de Programas Especiais (NEPE), renamed&#13;
in a recent (April 1997) Governor's decree that increased its autonomy and revised its&#13;
organizational structure, in line with the State's decentralization strategy for the public&#13;
sector. The PCU is the focal point for project administration and for communication with&#13;
the Bank and the State Government. It is also the project's principal liaison for the&#13;
Municipal Councils and for those community associations located in PAC municipalities.&#13;
Under the proposed project, the PCU will shed some of the executive responsibilities that&#13;
it held under the reformulated NRDP, delegating these to Municipal Councils and other&#13;
participating entities at the local level, and will concentrate on its monitoring, technical&#13;
assistance and supervision responsibilities.&#13;
2.20 The Maranhao PCU has a long experience in rural development, having&#13;
implemented the POLONORDESTE and NRDP projects as Technical Unit. The PCU&#13;
(NEPE) is an autonomous entity that is directly linked to the State Secretary of Planning&#13;
and is overseen by a Consultative Council, chaired by the Planning Secretary and&#13;
composed of representatives of the State Secretariats of Environment, Science and&#13;
Technology, and Agriculture as well as the State University of Maranhao, with the&#13;
Director of NEPE acting as Executive Secretary for the Council. The Director is assisted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20 -&#13;
by a Legal Advisory Group, a general Administrative and Financial Support Department&#13;
and a Physical and Financial Implementation Department, under which work four closely&#13;
interrelated Divisions, in charge, respectively, of subproject orientation and selection;&#13;
monitoring and evaluation; appraisal; and technical assistance and training. Under the&#13;
proposed project, NEPE will keep this structure although the Physical and Financial&#13;
Implementation Department will take on a more important planning function that will be&#13;
translated onto its name (see Organizational Chart in Annex D). As the PCU's staff is&#13;
limited (36 technical and 22 administrative staff) and concentrated in Sao Luis, all&#13;
technical assistance, training and supervision tasks under the project will be contracted to&#13;
other service providers, i.e., NGOs, university and other private specialists, as well as&#13;
other public agencies like EMATER (see Annex E). In the field, the PCU will link up with&#13;
these service providers through 11 "regional agents" (Agentes Regionais da Unidade&#13;
Tecnica - ARUTs), also to be contracted. In keeping with the State's administrative&#13;
reform program, the ARUTs will use existing offices of EMATER or other public&#13;
agencies located in 11 strategically important regions in the state (see Annex C), rather&#13;
than new facilities that the PCU would have to establish and maintain.&#13;
2.21  The PCU's principal tasks under the project would include: (a) project planning&#13;
and coordination at the state level through the preparation of POAs, including the&#13;
consolidation of POAs by FUMAC-P Councils, and monitoring activities through&#13;
maintenance of the project's MIS; (b) promoting the project and encouraging participation&#13;
of potential beneficiary communities, NGOs and private sector entities; (c) preparing&#13;
project implementation reports and organizing evaluation exercises; (d) ensuring timely&#13;
and adequate provision of loan and state counterpart funds; (e) appraising and approving&#13;
all PAC subproject proposals; (f) entering into subproject agreements with community&#13;
associations (PAC) and Municipal Councils (FUMAC) and into POA-based agreements&#13;
with FUMAC-P Municipal Councils, to transfer subproject funds and monitor their use;&#13;
(g) overseeing all monitoring and supervision activities under the project to ensure&#13;
compliance with project guidelines and to improve the quality of subprojects and project&#13;
interventions; (h) ensuring that environmental guidelines for subproject approval and&#13;
implementation are followed; (i) providing technical assistance to the FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P Municipal Councils; 0) preparing statements of expenditure (SOEs) and&#13;
applications for reimbursement; and (k) ensuring that procurement, disbursement and&#13;
auditing procedures applicable to the Bank loan are followed.&#13;
2.22 Assurances were provided by the State of Maranhao at negotiations that proposed&#13;
POAs and budgets satisfactory to the Bank would be furnished to the Bank in October of&#13;
each year; that the Bank would receive a copy of the final plan and budget as soon as they&#13;
are approved by the Borrower's Legislative Assembly; and that adequate counterpart&#13;
funding would be made available for the project in a timely manner by the State (para.&#13;
3.1(c)). Approval oftargets for any given year will be contingent upon performance in the&#13;
previous year, including a thorough analysis of the actual demand from communities, of&#13;
subproject costs actually observed, and of the number of uncompleted subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
2.23 Project Municipal Councils. Municipal Councils are the key entity for the&#13;
targeting of project benefits and the allocation of resources under the proposed project.&#13;
By their nature as open and representative bodies which build consensus on priorities, the&#13;
project Municipal Councils instill transparency into the decision-making process for&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P investments. The Councils would comprise representatives&#13;
from: (a) rural communities, civil groups and organizations such as NGOs, religious&#13;
organizations and rural labor unions; and (b) publicly-elected representatives and&#13;
municipal government officials. While the composition of these Councils may vary from&#13;
one municipality to another, representatives from rural communities and civil society&#13;
would make up at least 80%/ of the Councils' membership. The PCU would participate in&#13;
the Councils in an advisory capacity.&#13;
2.24 The Councils would receive, prioritize and approve subproject proposals from the&#13;
beneficiary associations during regularly scheduled meetings which are widely publicized&#13;
and which the public is encouraged to attend. The Councils would deliberate and&#13;
prioritize the subproject proposals presented according to their determination of the needs&#13;
of the different communities, based on criteria such as the level of poverty and the existing&#13;
infrastructure of each community in relation to the rest of the municipality; the type of&#13;
subproject to be financed and its potential to improve the quality of life of the beneficiary&#13;
population; and the demonstrated participation of the beneficiary community in the&#13;
identification of the subproject and its commitment to the operation and maintenance of&#13;
the subproject. Decisions to approve subprojects would be made by majority of votes and&#13;
based on pre-established technical criteria and/or standard designs. Detailed criteria, rules&#13;
and procedures for the Municipal Councils' structure and operations are included in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.25 The Municipal Councils would be entrusted with the following responsibilities: (a)&#13;
promoting the project in their areas; (b) facilitating assistance to the communities for&#13;
organizational strengthening and subproject preparation and execution; (c) prioritizing,&#13;
through local consensus-building, community subproject proposals and reviewing them for&#13;
approval or rejection; and (d) monitoring and supervising the implementation of approved&#13;
subprojects. Under FUMAC, the Municipal Councils will present subprojects which they&#13;
have approved to the PCU for financing; under FUMAC-P, the Councils will themselves&#13;
be responsible for managing the funds allocated to them and signing the subproject&#13;
agreements with the respective beneficiary associations (Annex F). Under FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P, the Municipal Councils foster partnerships among the community&#13;
associations, the municipal governments and the State Government to share the costs of&#13;
the subprojects and therefore leverage the loan funds to finance increased numbers of&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
2.26 Community Associations. Community associations are the foundation of project&#13;
implementation. These associations are responsible for formulating ideas for subprojects&#13;
and submitting these proposals to the Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-&#13;
P) or the PCU (under PAC) for approval. Once a subproject has been approved, the&#13;
community association enters into a legally binding agreement with the PCU and/or&#13;
Municipal Council through which the funds to implement the subproject are passed to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22 -&#13;
association. The association is responsible for all procurementand record-keeping during&#13;
the implementation of the subproject, as was practiced successfully in the reformulated&#13;
NRDP. Beneficiary associations contribute to subproject costs, either in cash, kind or&#13;
labor, and are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the investments.6&#13;
PROJECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAiNNG ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
2.27  Technical assistance and training to beneficiaries is an indispensable input to&#13;
successful and sustainable subproject investments. Technical assistance and training&#13;
would be provided to beneficiary communities via two mechanisms (see Annex E): (a) the&#13;
institutional development component (paras. 2.11-2.13); and (b) a percentage of&#13;
subproject costs allocated to technical assistance in subproject preparation. The&#13;
institutional development component provides flexibility and is not tied to any particular&#13;
subproject(s), so that communities can receive assistance even prior to subproject&#13;
preparation and after subproject completion. The component also allows for savings&#13;
because of economies of scale at the local level, since assistance can be contracted for&#13;
several communities at once (e.g., retainer contracts for operating expenses of local&#13;
extensionists). Finally, the operation of the component is decentralized and encourages&#13;
local-level accountability. Municipal Councils will be responsible for applying resources&#13;
from the component toward assistance to communities in their jurisdictions and all&#13;
technical assistance and training agents hired by the Municipal Councils or by the PCU and&#13;
approved by the Councils (in FUMAC) would be held accountable to the Councils for&#13;
their performance.&#13;
2.28 Complementary to the institutional development component, each community&#13;
association has the option of directing up to 8% of the cost of each subproject to hire&#13;
technical assistance and training support tailored to the particular subproject. A proposal&#13;
for the use of this percentage would be included in the subproject application. In addition,&#13;
because technical assistance should extend into the operation and maintenance period of&#13;
their subprojects, particularly for productive subprojects, community associations should&#13;
include technical assistance among the expenditures to be financed out of O&amp;M funds&#13;
maintained by each association. As part of their regular supervision efforts, the PCU and&#13;
the Municipal Councils would monitor the frequency and quality of technical assistance&#13;
and training provided to beneficiaries.&#13;
TARGETING AND GRADUATION&#13;
2.29 Beneficiary targeting would occur at three levels: (a) geographically by poverty&#13;
level and other characteristics of the municipality; (b) geographically within municipalities&#13;
to target rural settlements and communities; and (c) community-based selection of poor&#13;
beneficiaries and particularly vulnerable groups by the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
Targeting at the first and second levels defines the project area. The project area includes&#13;
all municipalities outside of the metropolitan region of Sao Luis, the state capital. Project&#13;
6 Beneficiary associations may request assistance from the PCU for procurement under subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
beneficiaries, however, include only those rural communities located in settlements of less&#13;
than 7,500 people, resulting in a project target population of about 1.8 million people.&#13;
Thus the target population lives in small, more isolated rural areas with greater&#13;
representation of the rural poor. The third and principal level of targeting is community-&#13;
based. Increased decentralization of subproject selection through the expanded FUMAC&#13;
and FUMAC-P programs will further strengthen the project's capacity to reach the most&#13;
needy communities in the project area. The Municipal Councils' prioritization process is&#13;
the basis of targeting in the project since the communities themselves, through their&#13;
majority participation in the Councils, determine where project resources will best be&#13;
applied based on their first-hand knowledge of community socio-economic conditions and&#13;
local investment needs. The clear and transparent rules and procedures for the Councils'&#13;
functioning, are also important for targeting poor beneficiaries at the lowest level. The&#13;
effectiveness of the targeting methodology in directing project benefits to the poor would&#13;
be assessed through the project monitoring system and through annual performance&#13;
reviews and the implementation review (Annex H). Details on targeting mechanisms are&#13;
included in Annex C. During appraisal, agreements were reached with the State of&#13;
Maranhao on these targeting mechanisms; these understandings would be reflected in the&#13;
final Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.30 Graduation of Communities and Municipalities. The demand-driven&#13;
community development model presented in the proposed project is expected to increase&#13;
the income-generating capacity and standards of living in the beneficiary communities.&#13;
Because project resources will be targeted to the poorest rural communities, certain&#13;
communities with better socio-economic standing relative to others would gradually&#13;
receive fewer investment resources during the course of project implementation. These&#13;
communities, able to leverage a critical mass of subprojects and other benefits from this&#13;
and previous Bank-financed and other projects, would gain access to other sources of&#13;
financing and reach a point where a "safety net" is no longer necessary. In order to&#13;
formalize this process, the proposed project would introduce a community graduation&#13;
strategy whereby those communities with demonstrated capacity for sustainable asset-&#13;
accumulation (savings), adequate social and economic infrastructure and community&#13;
organization, would progressively be charged a higher cost-sharing percentage (para.&#13;
2.45) and then eventually cease to be eligible for project matching grants (see Annex C).&#13;
To make this determination, profiles of beneficiary communities would be developed and&#13;
would include information on benefits from the reformulated NRDP and other public&#13;
programs, existing infrastructure and access to social services, indicators of&#13;
accumulation/savings (e.g., farm animals and equipment) and other indicators of&#13;
community well-being. The information would be collected from subproject proposals&#13;
submitted by the communities, incorporated into the MIS, and regularly updated through&#13;
monitoring and supervision exercises (see Annex H). The point at which a community&#13;
would provide a higher counterpart contribution and the subsequent "take-off' point, the&#13;
point at which a community would graduate from the project, would be estimated at the&#13;
end of the second year of the project, based on a study comparing community profiles and&#13;
indicators from the baseline impact evaluation. Using this analysis, the PCU (for PAC)&#13;
and the Municipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P), with the support of the PCU,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
would graduate those communities having reached the "take-off' point. As communities&#13;
graduate, those municipalities with fewer eligible communities would gradually receive&#13;
less funding for subprojects and, concurrently, would graduate from the program as well.&#13;
During appraisal, agreements were reached with the State of Maranhao on a community&#13;
graduation strategy; these understandings would be reflected in the final Project&#13;
Operational Manual.&#13;
COmmuNry SUBPROJECT CYCLE&#13;
2.31  Mobilization. The critical juncture in the community subproject cycle is the initial&#13;
stage when communities mobilize existing associations or form new associations which&#13;
can then benefit from the project. At the outset of and throughout the project, a publicity&#13;
campaign, carefully programmed and targeted to participating communities by the PCU to&#13;
create a level playing field for access to project funds, would disseminate information&#13;
about the project and its procedures to stimulate demand from potential beneficiaries&#13;
across the state. Some communities already have significant levels of organization, either&#13;
traditionally or from previous development projects in the area, and are poised to benefit&#13;
immediately from the project. However, for those less organized communities, the&#13;
project, through its institutional development component, would actively extend&#13;
mobilization assistance through the services of NGOs or accredited state agents (e.g.,&#13;
EMATER extensionists) who know the communities well and can serve as catalysts for&#13;
organization. These NGOs or accredited agents would mobilize the communities and&#13;
provide them with technical assistance for identifying and prioritizing their needs and&#13;
demands, preparing subprojects and forming associations, in order that all communities in&#13;
the project area can participate in project benefits. Through the MIS and regular&#13;
supervision, the PCU and project Municipal Councils would monitor the ex-post&#13;
allocation of project benefits, which would then facilitate targeting assistance to those&#13;
municipalities which had not yet received support.&#13;
2.32 Prionrtization and Preparation. Beneficiaries submit proposals for subproject&#13;
investments based on priority needs of their communities. Standard documentation for&#13;
subproject proposals, developed by the PCU, would be distributed to the beneficiary&#13;
associations to facilitate the subproject preparation and screening process. To ensure the&#13;
quality of the investments financed and to provide guidance to the beneficiaries when&#13;
preparing subprojects, the Project Operational Manual would contain standardized&#13;
technical designs, including simple environmental guidelines and cost parameters (e.g.,&#13;
cost per physical unit or per beneficiary) for the most frequent types of investments.&#13;
Beneficiary associations may request technical assistance for more sophisticated or less&#13;
common subproject types.&#13;
2.33 Various standard designs already exist. They would be updated under the project&#13;
and, depending on community demand, others could be developed for frequently&#13;
requested types of investments (Annex G). In some cases, specialists would be contracted&#13;
to prepare the designs, based on terms of reference agreed with the Bank. In others, the&#13;
PCU would gather and adapt existing designs (e.g., for pipes or box culverts, retaining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25 -&#13;
walls, fords, and decks of bridges) and make them available to the Municipal Councils and&#13;
associations. Standard designs will include the following considerations, where&#13;
appropriate: (a) engineering aspects; (b) technical, financial and economic feasibility; (c)&#13;
operation and maintenance; (d) recommendations on environmental impact; and (e) social&#13;
demand. This process will be facilitated by the ongoing Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects&#13;
in Bahia, Ceari and Sergipe, and by the fact that other Northeast States are be developing&#13;
similar projects. Hence, there will be considerable scope for dissemination and exchange&#13;
of designs among the professionals of the Maranhao PCU and the other State PCUs.&#13;
2.34 Appraisal. The appraisal of community subprojects would be carried out by the&#13;
Municipal Councils (under FIMAC and FUMAC-P) or the PCU (under PAC). The&#13;
appraisal procedures would take into account: (a) compliance with the project's guidelines&#13;
and eligibility criteria, including those related to the technical, environmental and cost&#13;
specifications contained in the Project Operational Manual; (b) the beneficiary&#13;
association's commitment to provide the required contribution and to take full&#13;
responsibility for the execution, operation and maintenance of the investments to be&#13;
funded; and (c) in the case of an association which has already benefited from other&#13;
subprojects, assessment of past performance. Using standardized cost indicators,&#13;
reasonable costing for subproject implementation would be ensured. Departures from&#13;
standard designs would have to be fully justified in the subproject proposal for review by&#13;
the Municipal Councils and/or the PCU, as would proposed investments which fall outside&#13;
the range of standardized costs.&#13;
2.35 Financing. In order to disburse funds for subproject implementation, agreements&#13;
(convenios) would be signed: (a) under FUMAC, between the PCU, the Municipal&#13;
Council and the beneficiary association for subproject funding and implementation; (b)&#13;
under FUMAC-P, between the Municipal Council and the association, for subproject&#13;
funding and implementation, and between the PCU and the Municipal Council for release&#13;
of project funds; and (c) under PAC, between the PCU and the beneficiary association for&#13;
subproject funding and implementation. Such agreements would spell out the terms and&#13;
conditions for the funding, execution, ownership, operation and maintenance of the&#13;
approved subprojects (para. 2.10). The final model agreements would form part of the&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.36  Subproject Supervision. Direct supervision and administration of the subprojects&#13;
are carried out by a community-elected Supervision and Control Committee (Annex D),&#13;
which oversees subproject execution, including contracting. This Committee of 3 to 4&#13;
persons is comprised of subproject beneficiaries, both members of the association and non-&#13;
members within the community. The PCU, the Municipal Councils or other contracted&#13;
groups, would visit the subproject sites during subproject execution to liaise with the&#13;
Supervision Committee and monitor physical and financial progress. The PCU would&#13;
have overall responsibility for supervision of the entire subproject cycle through the&#13;
project MIS (Annex H), which would track subproject progress from initial submission to&#13;
completion, and through accounting and auditing arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
2.37 Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M). Community associations would bear the&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M for all investments, as specified in the convenio for release of&#13;
project funds. These associations may request technical assistance to develop O&amp;M&#13;
programs and techniques. Experience to date under the NRDP has been positive with&#13;
respect to O&amp;M of investments when local communities have a strong sense of ownership.&#13;
2.38 Operational Checks and Balances. Operational checks and balances, included in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual, would promote transparency and accountability in the use&#13;
of project funds. Increased decentralization of resources and decision-making to&#13;
beneficiary associations and Municipal Councils, with only ex-post control by the State&#13;
through audit of accounts and supervision and monitoring by the PCU, is central to the&#13;
project strategy. However, this advancement would be accompanied by operational&#13;
disincentives, based mainly on education/joint problem solving and, as a last resort,&#13;
penalties, to deter potential departures from project guidelines such as misappropriation,&#13;
mistargeting, lack of participation or improper O&amp;M. Positive incentives for adherence to&#13;
project guidelines and or superior performance include the promotion of Municipal&#13;
Councils from FUMAC to FUMAC-P and, in FUMAC-P, a potential increase in the&#13;
Councils' budget envelope.&#13;
2.39 Project Monitoring and Supervision. Analysis of implementation will depend&#13;
on a database of subproject information from the project MIS, created under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP and to be improved under the project (para. 2.16). Inputs to the&#13;
database would be made from a standard data sheet at key stages of the subproject cycle&#13;
(e.g., identification, appraisal, procurement and disbursement. See also Annex H).&#13;
Periodic processing of the database information will permit the monitoring of the&#13;
characteristics and evolution of project implementation. The PCU, together with project&#13;
Municipal Councils, will be responsible for meeting and reporting on the project&#13;
performance indicators (para. 2.16). The Bank's Recife Office would monitor project&#13;
performance indicators through the MIS, which the Recife Office will maintain and update&#13;
on a regular basis with inputs from the states, and through review of monthly&#13;
disbursement summaries. The Recife Office will also supervise subproject implementation&#13;
progress on a sample basis in the field (see Annex K for Supervision Plan).&#13;
2.40 Project Operational Manual. The NRDP Operational Manual (Annex M) would&#13;
be adjusted and expanded to reflect the need for fine-tuning and additions based on recent&#13;
experience. Agreements were reached with the State during appraisal on the following&#13;
points to update and/or include in the Manual: (a) indicative quantitative and qualitative&#13;
targets to be tracked with the Project MIS; (b) the project area and the criteria used to&#13;
select the municipalities included in the project area; (c) the initial distribution of&#13;
municipalities among the three components (FUMAC, FUMAC-P and PAC) and the&#13;
criteria for future redistribution; (d) guidelines for the pilot component (FUMAC-P); (e)&#13;
arrangements for institutional strengthening and project administration, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; (f) the PCU's new structure and additional technical support agreements with&#13;
other state agencies and non-governmental organizations; (g) FUMAC and FUMAC-P&#13;
Municipal Councils' composition, responsibilities and modus operandi, notably in relation&#13;
to FUMAC-P; (h) clear identification and description of responsibilities of beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
and municipalities in the implementation of subprojects; (i) guidelines for environmental&#13;
assessment of subprojects; (j) model agreements to be signed between the PCU, the&#13;
Municipal Councils and beneficiary associations; (k) new standard agreements between the&#13;
PCU and the FUMAC-P Municipal Councils and between the FUMAC-P Municipal&#13;
Councils and the beneficiary associations; (1) standard forms for proposals to be submitted&#13;
by potential beneficiaries; (m) the cost-sharing matrix for the various types of subprojects;&#13;
(n) the fund release mechanism to beneficiaries for FUMAC-P; (o) operational incentives&#13;
and penalties; (p) monitoring arrangements, including a new classification of the various&#13;
categories of subprojects; (q) standard project designs and their role in the appraisal of&#13;
proposals submitted by beneficiaries; (r) a revised standard form of acceptance of&#13;
completed works (ata de recebimento); and (s) targeting mechanisms and a community&#13;
graduation strategy.&#13;
PROJECT COSTS&#13;
2.41  The total project cost, calculated in May 1997 prices and including contingencies,&#13;
is estimated at US$106.7 million. Foreign exchange costs are estimated to be US$22.9&#13;
million, equivalent to about 21% of total project cost. The baseline cost is estimated at&#13;
US$105.5 million, and contingencies at US$1.2 million. Contingencies are low because&#13;
they apply only to the two components of institutional development (except for costs&#13;
associated with technical assistance for state reform) and project administration,&#13;
supervision, monitoring and evaluation. For these activities, physical contingencies of&#13;
100% and 5% have been included, as well as annual price increases averaging 2.4% for&#13;
local and foreign costs (both expressed in US dollars). No contingency provisions have&#13;
been applied to the community subprojects component. Since the number of community&#13;
investments is not defined ex ante, it was considered preferable that any change in physical&#13;
or price attributes of subproject investments would be accommodated by a change in the&#13;
number of subprojects approved and implemented.&#13;
2.42  Investments in subprojects are expected to represent some 90% of the total base&#13;
cost (51% for FUMAC, 7% for FUMAC-P and 32% for PAC). The distribution among&#13;
different categories of subprojects, as well as the phasing of expenditures over the five-&#13;
year implementation period, are indicative only, and there would be flexibility to reallocate&#13;
funds from the PAC to the FUMAC or FUMAC-P subcomponents as Municipal Councils&#13;
gain experience.&#13;
FINANCING PLAN&#13;
2.43 The Borrower would be the State of Maranhao. The loan would be guaranteed by&#13;
the Federative Republic of Brazil. In accordance with the CAS Progress Report discussed&#13;
and approved by the Board in June 1996 as well as with the new CAS discussed by the&#13;
Board on June 12, 1997, and in reference to the strategy to be adopted for special&#13;
assistance to poor States, the State of Maranhao qualifies as a Borrower in the context of&#13;
this loan. The State Government of Maranhao has formulated and is adopting measures&#13;
for administrative and other state reforms that will improve its fiscal situation and ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28 -&#13;
its capacity to contribute required counterpart funding to the project and to repay the&#13;
loan.7&#13;
2.44 The Bank loan would be repayable over 15 years, including a five-year grace&#13;
period, and would bear interest at the Bank's standard variable rate. The loan of US$80.0&#13;
million equivalent would finance about 75% of the total project cost, and would disburse&#13;
against 100% of expenditures for technical assistance, training and evaluation studies,&#13;
75% of expenditures for community subprojects, 50% of expenditures for supervision&#13;
(except salaries) and 200/o of incremental project administrative costs (except salaries) and&#13;
monitoring. The' State Government would be responsible for the remaining 25% of total&#13;
project cost, with beneficiaries and their respective municipal governments contributing to&#13;
these counterpart funds. As it consistently did under the reformulated NRDP, the State&#13;
Government of Maranhao is expected to meet its counterpart funding obligations under&#13;
the new project, which would require annual counterpart funding of less than 1.5% of the&#13;
State's capital investment budget. Beneficiaries would provide a minimum of 10% of the&#13;
total costs of community-managed investments, in cash, labor or kind, amounting to&#13;
US$9.5 million. To enable the early start-up of project activities, retroactive financing&#13;
would be provided up to a maximum of US$8 million in respect of eligible expenditures&#13;
incurred up to twelve months before loan signing, but after May 9, 1997, when the project&#13;
was appraised. In addition to training for new Municipal Councils, the State already has a&#13;
substantial pipeline of community subprojects for review and financing for which it can&#13;
utilize this retroactive financing facility. Detailed project costs and the financing plan are&#13;
presented in the table below.&#13;

Including US$3.4 million in local taxes.&#13;
2.45 Cost Sharing and Sustainability. The cost estimates and average size of&#13;
community-managed subproject investments have been determined based on the&#13;
experience gained under the reformulated NRDP and the operation of its PAC and&#13;
FUMAC components. On this basis, the project is expected to finance some 3,400&#13;
community-managed subprojects over five years. Counterpart contributions by the&#13;
beneficiary communities and their respective municipal governments would be made&#13;
according to a cost-sharing matrix, which is part of the Project Operational Manual (para.&#13;
2.40). The minimum contribution of beneficiaries would be 10% --to increase for&#13;
beneficiaries from select communities as a first step toward graduation from the project--&#13;
and of municipal governments would be 5% (recommended but not required). The&#13;
relative share contributed by each community and municipal government would be based&#13;
on agreement between the two parties with the Municipal Council. As in the existing&#13;
NRDP, ownership of project facilities by the beneficiaries should enhance the sustainability&#13;
of community investments. A key element would be the establishment of sound&#13;
arrangements under the project for the provision of operating, maintenance and capital&#13;
replacement expenditures, the requirements for which would vary significantly among&#13;
types of subprojects and the availability of which would vary by municipality and&#13;
community association. The Project Operational Manual and the subproject agreements&#13;
(convenios) (para. 2.10) would contain specific guidelines concerning the funding of these&#13;
costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30 -&#13;
2.46 Experience since reformulation indicates that the sustainability of the community&#13;
subprojects is generally good. Subprojects would finance relatively small investments&#13;
which can easily be maintained by the communities themselves, both technically and&#13;
financially, as demonstrated under the NRDP, even prior to the 1993 reformulation with&#13;
the APCR component (see para. 1.13). Equally important is the fact that client-driven&#13;
subprojects, identified and implemented by the communities, have demonstrated a high&#13;
degree of ownership by the beneficiary groups and their consequent willingness to&#13;
maintain project investments. Under the reformulated NRDP, commitment by each&#13;
community group for operation and maintenance was a condition for the approval of&#13;
subprojects, and formed part of the subproject agreement to be signed with the beneficiary&#13;
community. Compliance has been good and these same features are built into the&#13;
proposed project. Finally, the formation and strengthening of project Municipal Councils,&#13;
which have been piloted successfully under the reformulated NRDP and will continue&#13;
under the proposed project, stimulate grassroots participation in local development, and&#13;
thus foster longer-term project sustainability.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
2.47 Procurement for community subprojects costing the equivalent of US$50,000 or&#13;
less and procured by local communities, would be carried out mainly through direct&#13;
contracting, and under subproject agreements signed between the PCU and the&#13;
community. This procurement procedure is appropriate because most subprojects: (a)&#13;
would be small and/or implemented in scattered or remote areas and therefore it will be&#13;
difficult to obtain competitive proposals; (b) can be managed directly by rural commuunities&#13;
which will contribute to the work through the donation of unskilled labor and local&#13;
materials; (c) will be selected on the basis of willingness of the beneficiary communities to&#13;
contribute to and physically supervise their execution; and (d) would provide a vehicle for&#13;
communities to play an active role in the local development process. There may be cases&#13;
when the community lacks the capacity to make the necessary purchases of equipment and&#13;
materials. For such subprojects, the PCU would make purchases on behalf of the&#13;
communities, packaging the procurement for several subprojects whenever possible.&#13;
Procurement by the PCU would follow: (a) National Shopping procedures for goods, and&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank for procurement of small works under lump sum, fixed&#13;
price contracts awarded on the basis of price quotations (under US$100,000 and up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$2.2 million for goods and US$2.6 million for small works); or&#13;
(b) National Competitive Bidding -- NCB (over US$100,000). For NCB the standard&#13;
bidding documents agreed between the Bank and the Federal Government of Brazil will be&#13;
used. ICB is not anticipated for any goods or works under the project. Although the&#13;
costs of individual subprojects may not exceed US$50,000, the average size of the&#13;
subprojects is expected to be less than US$30,000. Approximately 680 subprojects are&#13;
expected to be implemented yearly using these procurement methods.&#13;
2.48 Prior review of procurement documentation by the Bank would be made for all&#13;
NCB contracts. Although the level of Bank prior review of procurement would be low, it&#13;
would be compensated in several ways. First, a study of procurement by community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
contracting would be carried out during the first year of the project, under terms of&#13;
reference agreed during appraisal. Second, cost comparisons of similar subprojects would&#13;
be conducted using the project MIS (para. 2.16) in order to detect possible procurement&#13;
problems. Third, the project physical performance evaluation (Annex H) would analyze&#13;
procurement issues; and finally, during Bank supervision, random reviews would be&#13;
conducted of subprojects, including field visits and review of subproject documentation.&#13;
2.49   Consultant services to provide technical assistance and training to the beneficiary&#13;
communities, the Municipal Councils and the PCU would be procured in accordance with&#13;
Bank guidelines for the use of consultants. Contracts, short lists, and selection procedures&#13;
for technical assistance and training would receive prior review by the Bank when the&#13;
value of the contract is US$100,000 or more for consulting firms or US$50,000 or more&#13;
for individual consultants. All consultant terms of reference would be subject to Bank&#13;
prior review. During negotiations, assurances were provided by the State of Maranhlo&#13;
that: (a) the above procurement arrangements would be foliowed (para. 3.1(d)); and (b)&#13;
the study of procurement by community contracting referred to in para. 2.48 would be&#13;
carried out during the first year of the project and any agreed recommendations adopted&#13;
expeditiously (para. 3.1(d)). Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table&#13;
below.&#13;

DISBURSEMENTS AND SPECIAL AccouNT&#13;
2.50 The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of five years. The&#13;
project is expected to be completed by December 30, 2002, and the project's Closing Date&#13;
is June 31, 2003. The disbursement period shown in the projected Disbursement Schedule&#13;
(Annex I) is shorter than the Bank's standard disbursement profile for rural development&#13;
projects in Brazil, but is in line with the recent experience under the reformulated NRDP&#13;
and with other Bank-financed social fund projects in Latin America. The allocation of&#13;
loan proceeds by disbursement category is shown in Annex I.&#13;
2.51 During negotiations, assurances were provided by the State of Maranhao that it&#13;
would open and maintain a Special Account in US Dollars in a commercial bank for Bank&#13;
disbursements (para. 3.1(e)). The authorized allocation would be US$5.3 million,&#13;
adequate to cover the expected average four-month flow of disbursements under the&#13;
project. Disbursements for all expenditures would be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs), except for goods and works exceeding US$100,000 equivalent;&#13;
contracts with consulting firms above US$100,000 equivalent; and with individuals above&#13;
US$50,000.&#13;
2.52 The information required for the compilation of SOEs would be maintained by the&#13;
PCU in the MIS data base. All SOEs would be transmitted by the PCU to the Bank in&#13;
Washington. Simultaneously, the PCU would send to the Bank's Recife Office a copy of&#13;
SOEs and reimbursement applications submitted to the Bank in Washington, as weli as&#13;
updated information on the status of all subprojects, enabling a rapid review of subproject&#13;
eligibility. This procedure would allow the Bank and the PCU management to maintain a&#13;
cumulative account of the progress of project implementation.&#13;
2.53  The communities' contributions to subproject investments would be defined in the&#13;
agreement (convenio) between the PCU and the community association (for PAC),&#13;
between the PCU, the Municipal Council and the association (FUMAC) or between the&#13;
Municipal Council and the community association (FUMAC-P). Any contributions by&#13;
Municipal Governments would also be defined in the subproject agreements. Both&#13;
contributions would be computed as part of counterpart finance of the project. Simple,&#13;
standard records, whose format would be included in the Operational Manual, would be&#13;
completed by a designated community representative. They would be used to record cash&#13;
contributions, materials and labor inputs, and would be subject to project audit&#13;
procedures.&#13;
AccouNTs AND AUDITS&#13;
2.54 The PCU would maintain separate accounts for project expenditures, which would&#13;
be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The accounts of the&#13;
Municipal Councils (for the FUMAC-P subcomponent) and of the community associations&#13;
would also be subject to review by the independent auditors on a sample basis. - Finally,&#13;
independent auditors would also audit the Special Account (para. 2.51). Copies of the&#13;
audit reports would be provided to the Bank within six months of the end of each state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
fiscal year. The audit reports would convey the auditor's opinion and comment as&#13;
necessary on the methodology employed in the compilation of the statements of&#13;
expenditure, their accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents, eligibility for&#13;
financing in terms of the project's legal agreements and standards of record keeping and&#13;
internal controls related to the foregoing. The State of Maranhao provided assurances&#13;
during negotiations that: (a) the Special Account and the project accounts would be&#13;
established, maintained and audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing&#13;
principles, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (b) with respect to&#13;
withdrawals on the basis of SOEs, that such audits would contain a separate opinion as to&#13;
whether the SOEs, together with the procedures involved in their preparation, support the&#13;
related withdrawals; and (c) certified copies of the audited accounts and of the auditors'&#13;
reports would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each project&#13;
fiscal year (para. 3.1(f)).&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
2.55  The proposed project has been assigned a "B" environmental classification.&#13;
Because of their relatively small size, most PAC, FUMAC, and FUMAC-P subprojects&#13;
would not have a significant effect on the environment. The project would, however,&#13;
ensure proper environmental screening and enforcement measures, to prevent certain types&#13;
of productive or infrastructure subprojects from producing negative effects on the&#13;
environment. The Operational Manual would specify key environmental criteria and&#13;
screening and enforcement procedures to be followed.&#13;
2.56  Based on specific criteria for different subproject types, each subproject proposal&#13;
presented by the community associations would include a simple environmental&#13;
assessment in the form of a "checklist", following a standard format. For standard&#13;
subproject types, environmental screening at the subproject approval stage would be the&#13;
responsibility of the PCU and Municipal Councils. For exceptional subproject types, for&#13;
which technical standards have not been developed, the PCU would screen the subproject&#13;
proposals in detail for environmental impact, contracting technical assistance when&#13;
necessary, and this assessment and any subsequent recommendations would be&#13;
incorporated into the subproject proposal. For the FUMAC-P subprojects, the Municipal&#13;
Councils would conduct the environmental screening together with either the PCU or with&#13;
contracted technical assistance, such as NGOs. the PCU has identified expertise within the&#13;
state for technical assistance purposes and would include environmental education and&#13;
awareness as part of its training to Municipal Councils. Enforcement of environmental&#13;
criteria would be ensured via subproject supervision by the PCU and Municipal Councils.&#13;
POVERTY CATEGORY&#13;
2.57 The proposed project is part of the Bank's Program of Targeted Interventions.&#13;
Project municipalities in Maranhao were determined based on poverty-related indicators&#13;
and other key parameters (see Annex C), which will ensure that project resources reach&#13;
those municipalities which contain a high concentration of rural poor. The project's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34 -&#13;
targeting mechanism is then centered on community-based selection, with the assumption&#13;
that local communities can best judge what their investment priorities are in each&#13;
municipality. In particular, project Municipal Councils would be charged with targeting&#13;
poor rural dwellers and especially vulnerable groups, based on criteria including the socio-&#13;
economic situation of participating communities, their level of organization and the&#13;
availability of infrastructure and services. The transparency of rules and procedures for&#13;
Municipal Councils also would facilitate targeting under the project by permitting rural&#13;
communities to monitor local resource allocation decisions. Finally, communities which&#13;
eventually are determined to have capacity for sustainable asset-accumulation (savings)&#13;
and access to adequate social and economic infrastructure, would progressively be&#13;
charged a higher cost-sharing percentage and then would be graduated out of the program&#13;
(para. 2.30).&#13;
WOMEN'S PARTIC'IPATION&#13;
2.58  The full participation of women is critical to the poverty objectives of the project.&#13;
Bank-supported operations and studies in the Northeast of Brazil show the strong&#13;
correlation between the problems and needs of rural women and those of producers and&#13;
family units in general. Responding to lessons concerning women's participation, this&#13;
project will seek to ensure that women's activities (both traditional and innovative) are&#13;
included; to support subprojects which foster maternal/child health and day care facilities&#13;
(the latter have proven invaluable under the ongoing PAC/FUMAC operations in freeing&#13;
rural women for income generating activities); to target groups and activities in which&#13;
female participation has proven constructive; to provide technical assistance for women's&#13;
subproject proposals and implementation; and to monitor women's participation in the&#13;
project and its benefits. To achieve these objectives, the Maranhao PCU intends to tailor&#13;
some of the training under the project to the specific needs of rural women, and strengthen&#13;
the role of women in the identification and selection of community investment proposals.&#13;
PROJECT BENEFRTS&#13;
2.59 The proposed project would result in an improved quality of life for some 990,000&#13;
people (198,000 families) (about 55% of the target population), by providing improved&#13;
access to water supply and other basic social and economic infrastructure and services,&#13;
and by contributing to an increase in production, incomes and employment.8 Project-&#13;
financed rural water supply and minor irrigation works will be particularly important in&#13;
reducing vulnerability to drought. Productive subprojects will provide a vehicle for&#13;
financing improvements in input use, technology and value-adding activities, thus raising&#13;
productivity and incomes. Female community members will benefit especially from&#13;
subprojects such as water supply and some productive activities and social investments&#13;
which enable rural women to seek paying jobs and contribute to increased family cash&#13;
incomes.&#13;
s Assumes 10% of the beneficiaries are "repeater' beneficiaries and benefit from more than one&#13;
subproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
2.60 The proposed project will provide a safety net for some of the poorest segments of&#13;
Maranhao's rural population who will likely continue to be affected by decreased public&#13;
investments for services during the period of fiscal adjustment and macroeconomic reform.&#13;
Another important project benefit will be the creation of social capital within rural&#13;
municipalities and their communities. Municipal councils established under the project will&#13;
direct the identification and prioritization of local needs and confirm potential subproject&#13;
feasibility and compatibility with these priorities. Community resources, both financial and&#13;
in-kind, will be leveraged to achieve desired improvements in quality of life and access to&#13;
market channels. It is expected that the new project will have a similar impact on the&#13;
mobilization of additional community and municipal resources, as did the reformulated&#13;
NRDP (about 15% of resources invested under the program), and this will improve the&#13;
longer-term sustainability of investments. Project-related benefits can potentially generate&#13;
savings for state and municipal governments as well by reducing certain budgetary&#13;
obligations to rural areas, such as emergency water supply through water trucks (carros&#13;
pipa) or medical services. Finally, as a result of benefits from the project which lead to an&#13;
overall improvement in community organization and well-being and capacity to save, it is&#13;
expected that a small number of beneficiary communities will graduate from the project&#13;
and gain access to alternative sources of financing.&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
2.61  The demand-driven nature of the project implies that communities will determine&#13;
the nature and scope of each subproject funded and that neither benefits nor costs can be&#13;
identified ex ante, thereby prohibiting estimation of an ex ante overall internal economic&#13;
rate of return. Subprojects to be funded under the proposed project would, in general, be&#13;
similar to those subprojects funded and completed under the reformulated NRDP. To&#13;
give an illustrative idea of the financial and economic results that are likely to be obtained&#13;
under the proposed project, the experience and expost results of a sample of completed&#13;
subprojects under the NRDP have been examined and presented in Annex J.&#13;
2.62  Infrastructure and social subprojects were analyzed on the basis of least cost, best&#13;
alternative criteria. First, the demand-driven nature of each subproject permits scarce&#13;
resources to flow where they are most needed, thereby improving allocative efficiency.&#13;
Community participation, under the direction of the municipal councils created under the&#13;
project, ensure that the chosen subproject is the best alternative for the local community.&#13;
Second, the use of standard technical designs, including cost parameters, for the most&#13;
common types of subprojects ensures that least cost models are adopted and decreases&#13;
search and information costs by providing communities with established patterns of&#13;
initiating and completing a subproject. Third, the contracting procedures prescribed in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual require competitive bidding on all subprojects; the community&#13;
solicits three bids for the subproject and subsequently chooses the least-cost bid. Finally,&#13;
subprojects executed by the communities themselves have been shown to be more cost&#13;
effective than if they had been undertaken by the public sector (for details and examples,&#13;
see Annex B).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36 -&#13;
2.63 Financial and economic analyses were conducted on the following sample of&#13;
productive subprojects in MaranhMo: (a) rice mills, (b) manioc mills, and (c) communal&#13;
tractors. Financial IRRs for the subprojects evaluated all exceeded 50%. Economic IRRs&#13;
were also highly positive, ranging from 37% (tractors) to over 50% (manioc mills). The&#13;
primary factor in the difference between financial and economic IRRs is unpaid labor&#13;
required for each of the three subprojects. Various sensitivity analyses were undertaken&#13;
(e.g., by shadowing public funds), producing satisfactory IERR results.&#13;
2.64 Cost effectiveness was examined by estimation of benefit-cost ratios for each&#13;
productive subproject and investment per job created. Benefit-cost ratios range from 1.3&#13;
(tractors) to 1.8 (manioc mills). In addition, the financial sustainability of selected&#13;
productive subprojects was evaluated by examining (a) cost recovery measures undertaken&#13;
by each subproject and (b) the replacement period for initial capital equipment. In some&#13;
cases, user fees are assessed to cover O&amp;M expenses and contribute toward the eventual&#13;
replacement of capital equipment; in others, cost recovery takes the form of subproject&#13;
revenues (e.g., goat milk and meat sales, marketed produce). For all subprojects&#13;
evaluated, cost recovery was sufficient to cover O&amp;M expenses and replacement periods&#13;
for capital equipment were markedly less than the useful economic life of the equipment.&#13;
2.65 The fiscal impact of the project will derive from two sources: (a) cost savings&#13;
and (b) revenue generation. Experience has shown that local communities can undertake&#13;
and complete these small-scale subprojects at a lower total cost that is possible through&#13;
the public sector. For example, NRDP water supply subprojects have minimized the need&#13;
for water delivery via tanker trucks (carro pipa); based on conservative estimates, cost&#13;
savings for atl states under the reformulated NRDP due to these water subprojects range&#13;
from US$7 million in a year of normal precipitation to US$15 million in a drought year.&#13;
Surveys in many states indicate that infrastructure projects are, on average, about 30%&#13;
less expensive when implemented by the communities (i.e., demand-driven) than by&#13;
goverrnent agencies or contractors. Thus, by decentralizing toward the community level,&#13;
the state can achieve costs reductions which in turn will allow reallocation of scarce public&#13;
finance to other pressing needs. On the revenue side, the demand-driven nature of the&#13;
project precludes the ex ante estimation of fiscal revenues; however, experiences&#13;
accumulated under the reformulated NRDP can shed light on any potential changes in&#13;
public sector fiscal balances which may result from the project. Expanded commodity&#13;
production under the majority of the productive subprojects evaluated can potentially&#13;
generate additional public revenues through taxation.&#13;
PROJECT RISKS&#13;
2.66 Bank experience in Latin America and elsewhere suggests that the main sources of&#13;
risk for this type of program arise from: (a) irregular counterpart funding, which can&#13;
erode community confidence and interest in participating; (b) technical weaknesses and&#13;
inadequate supervision of large numbers of widely dispersed subprojects; (c) mistargeting&#13;
of program resources; and (d) undue political interference in subproject selection, which&#13;
often has the corollary effect of depressing local initiative and community involvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37 -&#13;
The funding risk will be mitigated by several distinguishing features of the projects. The&#13;
Bank loan, which will finance 75% of total project expenditures, will be taken directly by&#13;
the State, thereby eliminating those disbursement delays previously encountered at the&#13;
Federal level and minimizing the overall counterpart funding obligation of the State. In&#13;
addition, counterpart funding responsibilities would be shared to a larger extent by the&#13;
municipalities, decreasing the relative proportion of the State's own participation, and,&#13;
unlike in the reformulated NRDP, beneficiary contributions under the proposed project&#13;
will be counted toward the global counterpart requirements. The project will also help&#13;
address the State's fiscal deficit situation with technical assistance funds for administrative&#13;
reforms, thereby reducing the risk of counterpart funding difficulties. Finally, and perhaps&#13;
most importantly, the strong sense of ownership by the State, municipalities and&#13;
communities should help to protect project counterpart finding needs during the process&#13;
of allocating scarce budget resources. The risks of overdesign and weak supervision at&#13;
the subproject level would be substantially reduced with the establishment of standard&#13;
technical designs and cost criteria for the most common types of subprojects, and a&#13;
reinforced institutional strengthening component with specific resources allocated to&#13;
technical assistance for community associations. Increased delegation of supervision&#13;
responsibilities by the PCU to Municipal Councils and contracted public and non-&#13;
goverrnental agencies, will increase supervision coverage and will minimize the risk of&#13;
mistargeting of program resources. In addition, the project design has introduced a&#13;
system of strong operational disincentives against mistargeting and other departures from&#13;
project guidelines. For instance, a community or municipality would be obligated to&#13;
redress the problem, or be cut off entirely from the program, in cases of misappropriation,&#13;
mistargeting or insufficient participation. Finally, an information campaign targeted to&#13;
potential beneficiaries and the expansion of the FUMAC and FUMAC-P programs, will&#13;
stimulate greater community participation and increase transparency in the selection of&#13;
subprojects and thereby work against negative political influence in the allocation of&#13;
project resources.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;
MARANHAO&#13;
A. MARANHAO: A SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE&#13;
Geography and Climate&#13;
1.    With a total area of about 333,365 km2, the State of Maranhio is the second&#13;
largest state in the Northeast. It is bordered on the north by the Atlantic Ocean, and on&#13;
the west, south and east, respectively, by the states of Park, Tocantins and Piaui. In&#13;
contrast to the rest of the Northeast, most of the State lies outside the semi-arid "drought&#13;
polygon", and drought is relatively infrequent. Lying in a transitional zone between the&#13;
semi-arid Northeast and the tropical Amazon, the State has average annual rainfalls&#13;
varying from 2,200 mm in the northwest, to 1,600 mm in the northeast and center, to&#13;
1,000 mm in the south. Reflecting the rainfall pattern, the vegetation ranges from tropical&#13;
forest in the northwest, to native palm (babassu) in the central area, to the stunted&#13;
vegetation of the cerrado (elevated plains) in the south.&#13;
Demographic and Social Situation&#13;
2.    The population of the state is around 4.9 million (1991), of which 40% is urban&#13;
and 60% rural.' In the period between the two national censuses (1980 and 1991), the&#13;
population grew at around 1.9% per year, a rate commensurate with the rest of the&#13;
Northeast and Brazil overall. However, the urban population alone increased at a more&#13;
accelerated pace, growing at an average annual rate of 4.0%/o, compared with 0.7% for the&#13;
rural areas. This rapid urbanization reflects an increasing geographic concentration of&#13;
economic activity within the State. The resulting intensification of rural-urban migration&#13;
patterns, without a corresponding increase in public investment in infrastructure, has led to&#13;
a worsening of living conditions for the urban population.&#13;
3.    Aside from the strain placed on urban centers, the widespread exodus from the&#13;
countryside has also contributed to the exacerbation of poverty in the rural areas, where&#13;
opportunities for economic advancement have become increasingly limited. The&#13;
concentration of economic activity in the urban centers and in a few rural municipalities&#13;
has favored a centralization of resources which deprives most rural dwellers of an&#13;
adequate social and economic infrastructure (e.g., water supply, electricity, basic&#13;
sanitation, trash collection, housing and health and education services). In addition, a&#13;
IBGE, Census 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-                             Annex A&#13;
concentrated landholding stucture has limited workers' access to land and generated&#13;
social conflict. Innovations in production methods have failed to reach certain areas&#13;
where outmoded technologies continue to be used. All of these factors tend to favor the&#13;
expansion of large-scale commercial farming operations in the rural areas, further&#13;
restricting the productivity and eaning potential of smallholders. This trend has generated&#13;
a cycle of poverty for many rural dwellers, whose limited production capability hinders the&#13;
performance of the agricultural sector, thus reducing the possibilities for overcoming their&#13;
situation. Empirical evidence from Brazil and elsewhere shows that small and medium-&#13;
sized family farms continueto be more efficient and provide greater employment than&#13;
large corporate farms. In the Northeast, the 1985 Agricultural Census shows that&#13;
landholdings of less than 100 ha accounted for less than 30% of area, but 40%/o of assets,&#13;
55% of production and 86% of employment; further, non-utilization of land is more&#13;
common for larger farms. The result is that in 1985, the value of production per hectare&#13;
was three times higher for farms of less than 100 ha than for those exceeding 100 ha. As&#13;
in many other states of the Northeast, public policies in Maranhao have been ineffective in&#13;
exploiting the productive potential of smallholders as a way of combating rural poverty.&#13;
4.    The severity of rural poverty in Maranhao is borne out by a range of socio-&#13;
economic indicators. According to the Mapa da Fome, 44.9% of the population is&#13;
considered indigent, with 74.4% of indigent persons located in the rural areas, the highest&#13;
proportion among all the states in the Northeast.2 In fact, as evidence of the miserable&#13;
conditions that affect the majority of the State's population, a joint study by UNICEF and&#13;
lBGE reveals that 91% of the municipalities harbor very precarious living conditions&#13;
critically affecting rates of childhood survival. Unhealthy living conditions stem in large&#13;
part from a lack of adequate infrastructure, which disproportionately affects rural areas:&#13;
86% of rural households have inadequate water supply, compared with 58% in urban&#13;
areas; 666% of rural households have no sanitary facilities, compared with 24% in urban&#13;
areas; and only 9.2% of rural households are served by some sort of trash collection.&#13;
Rural housing is grossly inadequate in many zones and contributes to a high incidence of&#13;
Chagas disease from the insect vector which lives in the walls and roofing of deteriorated&#13;
dwellings. The lack of basic education or income-generating activities that families need&#13;
to pull themselves out of poverty is also more acute among rural dwellers: 39% of the&#13;
rural population over 14 years of age is illiterate, compared with 23% of the urban&#13;
population; and 66% of rural heads of household earn less than one minimum wage&#13;
(currently estimated at US$112 per month), compared with 54% in urban areas.3&#13;
The State Economy&#13;
5.    The economy of the State of Maranhao has been characterized by concentrated&#13;
growth since the mid-1980s. Although there is no record of the geographic distribution of&#13;
2 Indigence is defined as the level of income that corresponds, at the maximum, to the value of a 'basic&#13;
fod basket" that meets a family's minimum nutritional requirements, as defined by FAO/WHO.&#13;

-42 -                            Annex A&#13;
State GDP, the collection of ICMS can serve as a good indicator of the concentration of&#13;
economic activity.4 For example, only 8.8% of the State's municipalities accounted for&#13;
93.6% of total ICMS collected in 1994, with the municipality of Sao Luis alone generating&#13;
72.4% of total revenues for the State. The rising urbanization of the State has promoted&#13;
the development of the service industry, which absorbs the influx of unskdlled labor from&#13;
the rural areas. As evidence of the prominent role of service activities in the economy of&#13;
Maranhao, this sector produced 67% of the State's GDP in 1993, compared with a&#13;
contribution of 17% for industry and 16% for agriculture.5 In spite of its relatively low&#13;
participation in State GDP, the agriculture sector remains the largest employer in the&#13;
State. In 1995, about 59% of the State's economically active population of 2.5 million&#13;
was engaged in agricultural activities, a situation which reveals one of the primary causes&#13;
of poverty in rural areas.6&#13;
6.    The GDP of Maranhao was estimated by SUDENE to have reached US$8.5 billion&#13;
by 1994, corresponding to 8.6% of the GDP for the Northeast and 1.5% for Brazil.&#13;
According to the same source, the State's average annual growth rate for the period&#13;
1980/1994 was 6.41%, higher than that of the region (2.87%) and the country (1.87%).&#13;
In fact, between 1970 and 1992, Maranhao experienced the greatest economic growth&#13;
among all the states in the Northeast. However, average per capita income in 1994 was&#13;
estimated at about US$1,644, compared with US$2,229 for the Northeast and about&#13;
US$3,676 for Brazil, making the State the second lowest in the region in this regard. In&#13;
terms of revenues, Maranhao contributed 6.0% of all ICMS collected in the Northeast.8&#13;
Figures for 1995 indicate that the State derived 31.4% of its income from collection of&#13;
ICMS, with transfers from the Federal Government amounting to 59.3% of revenues.9&#13;
The Agricultural Sector&#13;
7.    Maranhio has the most highly skewed pattern of land ownership in the Northeast.&#13;
According to the Agricultural Census of 1985, some 20% of a total of about 531,413&#13;
recorded rural producers owned their land, while 38% were renters, another 4% were&#13;
sharecroppers and the balance of 38% were squatters. As in other states of the Northeast,&#13;
perverse incentives limit access to the land by the poor, even on a temporary basis. For&#13;
example, legislation on renting and sharecropping, typical forms of temporary access to&#13;
land, sets ceilings on rents and crop shares, providing almost permanent rights to tenants&#13;
after a few years but making such arrangements unattractive to owners and reducing&#13;
4  ICMS (Imposto sobre Circulagtfo de Mercadoria e Servifos) is the principal tax applicable to all&#13;
marketed products, of which 75% goes to the State and 25% is divided among the municipalities.&#13;

access for those the law was intended to protect. Similarly, agricultural land is a tax haven&#13;
for wealthy investors, thus increasing its price and reducing access for the smallholders&#13;
and landless workers unable to take advantage of tax laws.'° In terms of landholdings, the&#13;
1985 Census shows that small farms under 10 hectares account for some 84% of all farm&#13;
establishments, but only 4% of farmland; moving up the scale to farms of 100 hectares or&#13;
less (classified as small farms in terms of productive capacity under semi-arid conditions in&#13;
the absence of inputs), the percentage rises to 95% of total farm establishments and 20%&#13;
of farmland. Conversely, some 5% of farms hold 80% of farmland. Insecurity of land&#13;
tenure and high rents considerably restrict access to land and credit, when available.&#13;
Consequently, small farmers make use of few modem inputs outside of labor, relying on&#13;
traditional, non-mechanized production practices that are geared toward subsistence and&#13;
not the generation of surpluses for market.&#13;
8.    The agricultural economy is dominated by extensive livestock enterprises and the&#13;
production of traditional foodcrops (rice, cassava, maize and beans) and commercial crops&#13;
(bananas and babassu nuts). Rice is the principal crop, making Maranhao the second&#13;
largest producer in the country, and its production is dispersed among a large number of&#13;
small productive units. Only two municipalities have a production volume exceeding&#13;
30,000 tons/year; 13.2% of the municipalities, accounting for 30.0% of rice production,&#13;
produce about 10-30,000 tons/year; and the majority of municipalities (83.8%) produce&#13;
less than 10,000 tons/year, corresponding to 44.3% of the state's total volume. Another&#13;
subsistence crop of relative importance is com, of which 47.8% of total volume is&#13;
produced in 10.0% of the municipalities. On the other hand, the majority (85.8% of&#13;
municipalities) produced less than 5,000 tons/year, yielding 56.5% of all the com in the&#13;
state. Manioc, though a traditional crop in the state, has been losing importance every&#13;
year. As a complementary food crop, it can be found in every municipality; however, only&#13;
nine municipalities produce more than 50,000 tons/year, contributing 40.2% of all manioc&#13;
produced in the State. The production of soybean, which has been growing at high rates&#13;
in Maranhao, is concentrated in the southern part of the state and destined mainly for&#13;
export.&#13;
9.    With the exception of soybean, the production of food crops has experienced great&#13;
instability, particularly since the early 1980s, a trend reflected in the decline of the relative&#13;
contribution of agriculture to state GDP. A distorted land ownership structure, the&#13;
expansion of livestock grazing and limitations on credit further diminish the role of the&#13;
primary sector in the state's economy. For example, total production of grains reached&#13;
1,584,000 tons in 1994, a 7.0% decline in production from 1988; meanwhile, production&#13;
of sugar cane reached 1,591,000 tons, the lowest volume since 1988. In fact, indices of&#13;
production for grains have steadily declined over the last three decades, reducing&#13;
Maranhio's contribution to national grains production from 4.0% in the period 1964/1966&#13;
to only 1.4% in the period 1992/1994. " Because of the relatively poor performance of&#13;

the agricultural sector, the overall economic growth in the State has failed to reach the&#13;
majority of rural dwellers and done little to improve their precarious social conditions.&#13;
Indigenous Populations&#13;
10.    An estimated 13,600 indigenous people live in 16 Indigenous Reservations in&#13;
Maranhio. All but two of these reservations (Krikati and Awa Guaya) have to date been&#13;
demarcated and registered. Demarcated indigenous areas occupy a total of 1.7 million&#13;
hectares, with an additional 211,700 ha having been delimited but not yet demarcated.&#13;
The indigenous population of the State is descended from two distinct linguistic branches:&#13;
the Tupi, which includes the Tenetehara and the Tupi; and the Macro-Je, which can be&#13;
identified as part of the Timbira nation.'2 Although some indigenous groups have a&#13;
history of interaction with national society dating back to the seventeenth century, others&#13;
have systematically resisted contact as late as the 1970s. As has frequently been the case&#13;
with contact between indigenous groups and national society, a pattern of ethnic&#13;
deterioration over time has ensued from such contacts in the State of Maranhao.&#13;
Government policies favoring large landholders and persistent drought throughout the&#13;
Northeast have encouraged large groups of landless peasants and small farmers to migrate&#13;
to the Amazonian frontier, where they have come into conflict with the indigenous&#13;
inhabitants of this region. Facing limited options for livelihood, both the migrant and the&#13;
indigenous populations live under conditions of severe poverty and deprivation.&#13;
11.   Since the establishment of the Law of the Indian in 1973, the Foundation for&#13;
Amerindian Affairs (FUNAI) has served as the coordinating agency in the Federal&#13;
Government's efforts to protect the indigenous peoples of Brazil.'3 FUNAI has provided&#13;
assistance in the form of reservations, intermediation with national society, health and&#13;
education services. At present, however, FUNAI is undergoing a phase of administrative&#13;
reform, as a result of political developments in the past decade that have challenged its&#13;
traditional role as guardian of the indigenous populations. The Federal Constitution of&#13;
1988, under Article 231, established the principle of self-deternination for indigenous&#13;
peoples and their autonomy in defining the type of relationship they wish to maintain with&#13;
national society. While this Article awaits final ratification, there are two essentially&#13;
opposing legal directives governing the official position on indigenous affairs.&#13;
12.   The reformulated NRDP-Maranhlo has been instrumental in fostering the civil&#13;
autonomy of the State's indigenous communities and promoting their interaction with&#13;
national society. Under the FUMAC component, the project has caused a consolidation of&#13;
indigenous councils, formed on the basis of independent indigenous associations, which&#13;
assume the role of managers of resources destined for them. The FUMAC methodology&#13;
and management model is suitable for a group of communities which traditionally practice&#13;
a collective method of decision-making on socially relevant matters and the delegation of&#13;

powers. In the municipality of Barra do Corda for example, an indigenous FUMAC&#13;
Council has been established comprising representatives of various ethnic groups living in&#13;
FUNAI-demarcated reserves. The Council meets regularly to deliberate on the&#13;
subprojects proposed by the communities, after Council members make preliminary visits&#13;
to the villages to evaluate the legitimacy and viability of the proposals. In addition, the&#13;
Council itself facilitates the contracting of firms to provide technical assistance in the&#13;
elaboration and execution of community subprojects. This emphasis on meeting the real&#13;
needs of indigenous communities through culturally attuned methods has shown positive&#13;
results. The proposals approved by this Council represent 700/o of all proposals submitted&#13;
by indigenous communities between 1994 and 1996. Building on its successful&#13;
experience, this Council has already initiated a dialogue with indigenous groups in other&#13;
parts of the State.&#13;
State Government Strategy to Alleviate Poverty&#13;
13.  In its strategy for sustainable development for the period 1996/1999, the State of&#13;
Maranhlo focuses on reducing inequalities in the geographic and social distribution of&#13;
income and wealth. As part of its strategy to alleviate poverty, the State's priorities are:&#13;
(a) to provide technical and financial incentives for small producers and entrepreneurs to&#13;
contribute to the generation of employment; (b) to increase the supply and affordability of&#13;
basic food products; (c) to increase the population's access to basic health services; (d) to&#13;
greatly improve the social indicators for infant mortality, illiteracy, life expectancy,&#13;
sanitation and housing; (e) to systematically reduce high rates of grade repetition and&#13;
school drop-out which increase the costs of education and reduce the indices of school&#13;
attainment; (f) to expand opportunities for technical and professional development geared&#13;
towards the labor market; (g) to mobilize governmental and non-governmental&#13;
organizations for the eradication of misery and hunger in the State; (h) to ensure&#13;
democratic access to information as an instrument for improving community organizations&#13;
and their management capabilities; and (i) to diversify and disperse economic activities,&#13;
with an emphasis on exploiting the potential of local communities and establishing more&#13;
efficient methods for the distribution of services. The Government is mindful of the&#13;
lessons from the NRDP project, which stressed decentralization, popular participation and&#13;
administrative transparency. Through the establishment of municipal councils, it&#13;
collaborates with community organizations to define concrete investment proposals for&#13;
developing economic and social infrastructure and generating local employment and&#13;
income.&#13;
Experiences with Bank-Financed Development Programs&#13;
14.   The history of the State's involvement with Bank-financed rural development&#13;
programs is consistent with that of the other Northeastern states. As part of the&#13;
POLONORDESTE operations of the 1970s and early 1980s, the MaranhLo Rural&#13;
Development Project (Loan 2177-BR) met its physical targets but experienced&#13;
implementation and disbursement delays, mainly because of Federal counterpart funding&#13;
and rural credit problems, over-centralized project administration and limited beneficiary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46 -                           Annex A&#13;
participation in project planming and execution. Lack of coordination, duplication of effort&#13;
and competition for scarce finds were also key factors. Nevertheless, the project did&#13;
strengthen state institutional capabilities, and established services and infrastructure which&#13;
energized a process of agricultural modernization and proved a useful basis for further&#13;
rural development programs.&#13;
15.   The Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP), initiated between 1985 and&#13;
1987, was largely unable to improve on the performance of POLONORDESTE but did&#13;
successfully launch the community-based rural development methodology through the&#13;
small APCR component. Maranhao's experience was no exception to this pattern. The&#13;
NRDP, like POLONORDESTE, also made other important contributions: it paved the&#13;
way for administrative decentralization, a more strategic approach to rural development,&#13;
the involvement of NGOs and a greater role for communities in project planning and&#13;
execution. The NRDP projects in each of the Northeast states were reformulated in 1993&#13;
by essentially converting the successful APCR component into the primary model for&#13;
development.&#13;
16.   The reformulated NRDP in Maranhao has achieved its primary implementation&#13;
benchmarks established at the time of reformulation, in large part because of the strong&#13;
commitment of the State Government, and the willingness of many municipalities to share&#13;
counterpart funding, despite the chronic fiscal crisis affecting the State in recent years.&#13;
Community subprojects are being implemented according to the guidelines of the&#13;
Operational Manual, which include beneficiary participation in subproject identification,&#13;
imnplementation, and operation and maintenance. Most of these subprojects show tangible&#13;
impact on beneficiaries in terms of income, employment opportunities and standard of&#13;
living.&#13;
17.   The NRDP-Maranhao project closed on December 31, 1996. Of the original&#13;
NRDP loan of US$84.0 million, signed on July 20, 1987, US$22.8 million had been&#13;
disbursed at the time of reformulation. Since then, another US$57.4 million were&#13;
disbursed, leaving an outstanding balance of US$3.8 million. The rate of disbursements&#13;
improved resoundingly after the NRDP reformulation: prior to reformulation, the NRDP-&#13;
Maranhao project disbursed an average of US$4.3 million annually, and after&#13;
reformulation this rate jumped to US$17.7 million. By the Closing Date, beneficiary&#13;
communities had submitted some 6,240 proposals, of which 3,065 were financed. Some&#13;
65% of the subprojects financed were for infrastructure investments, 30% were for&#13;
productive activities and 5% were for social investments. These investments benefited&#13;
some 324,900 poor rural families including 2,100 Amerindian families, in 135&#13;
municipalities (the entire state excluding the state capital). The number of beneficiary&#13;
families was four times greater than estimated at project appraisal and ten times the&#13;
number estimated at project reformulation (see Annex B for details).&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
MARANHAO&#13;
THE REFORMULATED NORTHEAST RURAL&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (NRDP): PERFORMANCE AND&#13;
EVALUATION&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The largest concentration of rural poverty in Latin America is found in the Northeast, a&#13;
region that spreads over nine States and part of a tenth and is inhabited by over half of Brazil's&#13;
poor and nearly two-thirds of its rural poor.' Rural development programs established in this&#13;
region since the early 1970s had not succeeded in alleviating poverty -- including the Northeast&#13;
Rural Development Program (NRDP), which sought to improve living standards of small farm&#13;
families and reduce poverty through individual projects initiated between 1985 and 1987 in the ten&#13;
Northeast states. For several years, with the exception of one component supporting small&#13;
community projects, implementation of the NRDP lagged behind schedule and performance in&#13;
meeting basic project objectives was weak. However, its innovative community-based&#13;
component, Apoio as Pequenas Comunidades Rurais (APCR), relying on the planning and&#13;
organizational capabilities of communities and recognizing their expressed needs, produced very&#13;
encouraging --and replicable-- results: the poverty alleviation impact of the APCR was positive,&#13;
the cost per family relatively low, and its disbursement and commitment rates far exceeded those&#13;
of other components. In 1993, based on the successful experience of this component and on&#13;
lessons learned with similar schemes elsewhere in Latin America, the Federal Government and the&#13;
Bank reformulated the NRDP into an entirely community-based development program. This&#13;
reformulation, concomitant with the administrative and fiscal decentralization embodied in the&#13;
new Brazilian constitution of 1988, decentralized decision-making, program counterpart funding&#13;
and implementation, from the Federal Government to the States and localities. It allowed rural&#13;
communities to identify their own needs and execute their own subprojects, while committing&#13;
themselves to contributing to the cost of the investments and taking charge of their operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M).&#13;
2.    Effective in late 1993, the reformulated NRDP provided matching grants to rural&#13;
community associations to finance small-scale subprojects (up to US$40,000) that were identified&#13;
by these groups as priority investments to improve community well-being. Choosing among&#13;
The Northeast Region includes the States of Maranhao, Piaui, CearA, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba,&#13;
Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia and the northern part of the State of Minas Gerais.&#13;

- 48 -                       Annex B&#13;
eligible subprojects, the beneficiaries solicited investments which responded to their most critical&#13;
needs. The methodology incorporated two different delivery mechanisms for screening,&#13;
approving and implementing community subprojects: (a) State Community Schemes (PAC) in&#13;
which rural communities submitted their subproject investment proposals directly to the State&#13;
Project Technical Unit (TU). The TU screened, approved and released funds for subprojects,&#13;
interacting directly with the beneficiaries; and (b) Pilot Municipal Community Schemes&#13;
(FUMAC), in which subprojects identified and prepared by rural communities were presented to&#13;
project Municipal Councils for review. The FUMAC Councils, composed of community members&#13;
and representatives of local governments as well as of civil society, promoted local-level&#13;
consensus-building on priority needs through open "town meetings", and screened and submitted&#13;
subprojects to the State for subsequent approval and financing. Originally, the pilot FUMAC was&#13;
to reach only 5 and 10 municipalities per state; due to rapid success, this initial target was&#13;
surpassed in most states: at the end of the program, FUMAC was covering a total of 168&#13;
municipalities in the ten states. Of the last four loans, the NRDP-Alagoas closed on September&#13;
30, 1996 and those for Paraiba, Maranhao and Minas Gerais on December 31, 1996.&#13;
3.    This Annex contains an evaluation, undertaken in late 1996 by the Bank and FAO (United&#13;
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) and updated during appraisal of the proposed&#13;
project, of the performance and impact of the reformulated NRDP during its approximately three&#13;
years of implementation. Some aspects of the analysis, based on the latest information from&#13;
NRDP's Simplified Project Monitoring System (SSMP) and State databases as well as findings of&#13;
earlier studies, cover the overall program in the ten participating states. Other aspects, in&#13;
particular the socio-economic impact of subproject investments, have been analyzed specifically&#13;
for the State of Maranhao. Featured below are: (a) the information base used for the evaluation; (b)&#13;
implementation results, in terns of NRDP subprojects and loan disbursements, in each of the states; (c)&#13;
an impact analysis of the reformulated program at the state and municipal levels for all ten states, and at&#13;
the local level for Maranhio; (d) the advantages of FUMAC over PAC, the two delivery mechanisms&#13;
available under the NRDP; (e) a technical assessment of subprojects; (f) an assessment of institutional&#13;
performance under the program, and (g) conclusions and recommendations for design improvements in&#13;
follow-up projects.&#13;
4.    The different evaluations of the reformulated NRDP converge to show that, after several&#13;
decades of experience with rural development efforts in the Northeast, a good measure of success&#13;
was achieved with this program in reaching the rural poor through targeted interventions. They&#13;
also bring out important lessons, which are consistent in many respects with lessons learned&#13;
elsewhere in Latin America and other regions with similar community-based development&#13;
programs. These lessons indicate, in particular, that some adjustments to project design and&#13;
operational features would further enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of this approach.&#13;

(d)   Impact evaluation findings from surveys by the Bank/FAO in November 1996, of&#13;
the most common types of subprojects financed in Maranhao. The surveys&#13;
focused on the following aspects: (i) the process of subproject identification,&#13;
implementation, technical assistance and supervision; (ii) the nature of the&#13;
subproject (investments funded); (ii) special qualitative and quantitative&#13;
information; and (iv) socio-economic results/impact of the subproject.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS&#13;
Subprojects and Beneficiaries&#13;
6.    Statistical information, obtained from the SSMP and State databases, on the performance&#13;
of each of the participating states at closing date of the last NRDP loans is presented in Tables 1&#13;
to 6. Out of a total of nearly 46,590 subproject proposals submitted by potential beneficiaries in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-                         Annex B&#13;
the ten states since reformulation, 17,860 community subprojects were financed, of which some&#13;
14,150 under PAC and 3,710 under FUMAC. In Maranhao, 3,065 subprojects (2,110 PAC and&#13;
955 FUMAC) were funded, out of 6,244 subproject proposals received from communities&#13;
throughout the state (Table 1). Of the participating states, Maranhao --followed by Ceara, Bahia&#13;
and Paraiba- funded the largest number of community investments under NRDP.&#13;
7.    During its 3 years of implementation, the reformulated NRDP reached about 1.8 million&#13;
poor rural families in the Northeast. With community subproject investments totaling about&#13;
US$424 million in the ten states, the delivery cost of the program was strikingly low, at less than&#13;
US$250 per beneficiary family. These recipient families include an estimated 10 to 20%&#13;
"repeater" families which benefited from more than one subproject, belonging to different types of&#13;
investments. Such families form part of community associations which typically are better&#13;
organized than others, usually with support from NGOs and/or other technical assistance&#13;
agencies. The gradual accumulation by some of the target population of benefits and assets from&#13;
different NRDP subprojects as well as from other programs has a significant impact on&#13;
community development. It would constitute an important element of a strategy to graduate&#13;
some of the NRDP recipients into other, non grant-based programs (paras. 18-19).&#13;
8.    Throughout the participating states, more than 100 different types of subprojects were&#13;
proposed by rural communities. A large majority of these constitute basic rural infrastructure&#13;
(such as electrification and water supply), followed by productive subprojects (mostly small-scale&#13;
agro-processing and communal tractors) and, to a lesser extent, investments of a social nature&#13;
(chiefly day care centers or house improvement). Table 2 shows community demand for the most&#13;
common types of subprojects for the NRDP as a whole, and separately for the states of Paraiba,&#13;
Maranhao, Minas Gerais and Alagoas. In all participating states, the most popular types of&#13;
investments were rural electrification and water supply; in Maranhao, due to the poor conditions&#13;
of most village roads, rehabilitation of these roads was also often requested. The profile of the&#13;
subprojects financed was in line with community demand: out of the total number of subprojects&#13;
implemented in the ten states, some 61% were for rural infrastructure, 33% for productive&#13;
investments and 6% for social subprojects (Table 1). Maranhao conforms closely to this overall&#13;
picture, with 65% of all subprojects approved in this state made up of infrastructure&#13;
(predominantly localized road rehabilitation and rural electrification, followed by water supply),&#13;
against 30%/o and 5%, respectively, for productive (mainly rice and manioc flour mills) and social&#13;
(mostly house improvement) subprojects. Most NRDP-funded infrastructure investments,&#13;
particularly rural electrification, led to productive activities that raised family incomes and&#13;
increased employment opportunities.&#13;
9.    Owing to its strong popularity with communities and municipalities, the FUMAC pilot&#13;
component was expanded towards the end of the project implementation period to reach over&#13;
20% of all subprojects approved under NRDP in the ten states (Table 1). FUMAC also delivered&#13;
more community investments per municipality than PAC, as subprojects are processed faster&#13;
when they are screened at the local level through the FUMAC Municipal Council. On average,&#13;
about 22- subprojects were implemented in each municipality under FUMAC, compared with only&#13;
11 under PAC (Table 3). Among the ten states, Maranhao achieved the largest absolute number&#13;
of FUMAC subprojects (955), representing 31% of all NRDP-financed community investments in&#13;
the state. This compares with 37% (FUMAC subprojects over the total) in Paraiba and, at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-                         Annex B&#13;
end of the spectrum, 8% in Alagoas. Indeed, depending on the local socio-political situation,&#13;
conditions favorable to the FIJMAC process, as promoted under NRDP, differ from state to state.&#13;
Thus, if this delivery mechanism has been more widespread and successful in states like Minas&#13;
Gerais and Paraiba, where a tradition of community organization and participation is accompanied&#13;
by a favorable political environment, FUMAC has been extremely limited in Alagoas due to the&#13;
difficult political circumstances in this state.&#13;
10.   Subprojects costs were similar for PAC and FUMAC, averaging about US$24,000 per&#13;
subproject for the ten states as a whole (Table 4). Whether PAC or FUMAC, infrastructure and&#13;
social subprojects generally benefited larger numbers of people than productive subprojects, and&#13;
thus tended to have lower costs per beneficiary. The average cost per subproject varied among&#13;
investment types, ranging from about US$14,800 for manioc flour mills to nearly US$30,000 for&#13;
communal farm tractors (Table 5). Within each type, costs could vary substantially from one state&#13;
to the other depending on the specific nature and technical requirements of the subproject.&#13;
Loan Disbursements&#13;
11.   Final analysis of loan disbursements shows that the NRDP's overall disbursement rate was&#13;
significantly higher than its historical equivalent before reformulation (Table 6). In just over three&#13;
years a total of US$338.6 million of loan funds was disbursed under the reformulated program&#13;
(late 1993 to end-1996), as compared to only US$302.1 million during the entire implementation&#13;
period of the original NRDP (1985-late 1993). It should also be noted that municipalities in states&#13;
like Maranhao and Paraiba frequently contributed to counterpart funds, in light of shortages at the&#13;
state level. For the program as a whole, it is estimated that 93% of project funds disbursed&#13;
reached the beneficiary communities directly, as compared with only 44% under the original&#13;
NRDP. In Maranhao, some US$57.4 million was disbursed under the reformulated NRDP (as&#13;
compared to US$22.8 million in the period before reformulation), with an outstanding loan&#13;
balance of US$3.8 million to be canceled.&#13;
EVALUATION&#13;
State and Municipal Levels&#13;
12.   Based on conservative estimates derived from SSMP data and information provided by the&#13;
state TUs, arnple evidence exists to show that the reformulated NRDP was cost-effective in&#13;
attending to the rural poor in the Northeast. First, the program delivered low-cost basic&#13;
infrastructure and services that would have constituted a larger burden on State and Municipal&#13;
Government budgets, had they been executed under force account rather than by the communities&#13;
themselves. Given the fiscal difficulties faced by most of these governments, such investments&#13;
and services would probably have required a longer timeframe to complete than with the NRDP.&#13;
Second, the rural water supply structures installed under the program are providing water to&#13;
beneficiary communities on a more permanent and wider basis, substituting in these areas for&#13;
annual and/or extraordinary expenditures that municipalities and States have traditionally had to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52-                        Annex B&#13;
incur to reduce the effects of often severe and protracted drought on their rural communities.&#13;
Third, on the revenue side, those NRDP-financed productive subprojects that generate surplus&#13;
agricultural produce (including high-value and industrial crops) and non-agricultural commodities&#13;
(such as clothes), can add to State and municipal tax revenue when their outputs are sold in&#13;
formal markets.&#13;
13.   With respect to construction costs, surveys in many states have shown that infrastructure&#13;
projects are, on average, about 30% less expensive when they are implemented by the&#13;
communities themselves (directly or through small local firms) than by government agencies or&#13;
contractors. Data provided by the TU in Maranhao clearly confirm this finding: in this state, rural&#13;
water supply systems funded by NRDP cost, on average, US$23,000 as compared to US$32,000&#13;
when the system is installed by CAEMA, the state water and sewage company; for rural&#13;
electrification, NRDP costs --depending on the type of network-- ranged between US$3,750 and&#13;
US$17,100 per km against US$6,300-US$19,400 per km as charged by the state electricity&#13;
company (CEMAR); and for rural road rehabilitation, the cost was US$6,000 per km under&#13;
NRDP as compared to US$9,700 per km when the works are executed by the state Roads&#13;
Department. Conservatively assuming that only half of all community subprojects financed by the&#13;
reformulated NRDP were effectively 30% cheaper than if they had been implemented by public&#13;
agencies,, total savings in this regard for the Northeast State governments would be the equivalent&#13;
of US$64 million (the total investment cost of the approximately 17,860 subprojects implemented&#13;
under the program, as shown in Table 1, amounts to some US$424 million).&#13;
14.  In the areas where they were installed, NRDP water supply systems have eliminated the&#13;
need for municipalities to provide water by carro pipa (water bowser) to rural communities, both&#13;
in years of "normal" precipitation and in periods of drought (during which additional emergency&#13;
funds may be required from the State and the Federal Governments). NRDP water supply&#13;
subprojects helped to minimize that recurring expenditure, and municipalities could use the funds&#13;
thus saved to attend to the many other needs of their populations. For all the municipalities which&#13;
benefited from the 2,700 NRDP water supply subprojects financed in the ten states, the actual&#13;
annual savings to their respective budgets from not having to provide the corresponding carros&#13;
pipa are estimated to range from about US$7 million in a year of normal precipitation to more&#13;
than US$15 million in a drought year.&#13;
15.   NRDP investments also generate tax revenue for the State and Municipal governments on&#13;
marketed outputs of productive subprojects.2 For example, sales taxes on rice and manioc flour&#13;
produced currently by the 140 rice mill subprojects and the 80 manioc flour mills financed in&#13;
Maranhio and remaining for sale after family consumption are estimated to amount to about&#13;
US$0.7 million per year.&#13;
2 ICMS is the principal tax applicable to marketed products, of which 75% goes to the State and 25% is divided&#13;
among the municipalities. The rate of ICMS varies according to the state and the product. In Maranhao, an&#13;
ICMS ranging between 12% and 17% is applied to sales of certain agricultural products, including basic&#13;
foodcrops. On the other hand, as in other states, some staples like manioc are exempt of ICMS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53-                         Annex B&#13;
Local Level&#13;
16.   At the community level, the NRDP has had a positive impact on the quality of life of&#13;
beneficiaries and on the local economy. The availability of electricity and water supply, the&#13;
localized improvements to feeder roads and bridges, the rehabilitation of rural schools and health&#13;
posts, and finally the provision of community-owned and operated facilities and services in&#13;
support of local production, have changed the socio-economic outlook of those communities that&#13;
have been reached by the NRDP. With the increases in local capacity and multiplier effects&#13;
produced by the program, endogenous economic development has begun to emerge, leading to&#13;
savings accumulation both at household and community levels. Except in cases where technical&#13;
assistance was lacking, community cohesion was weak and/or cases of subproject types&#13;
addressing individual needs and requiring entrepreneurial skills which poor community&#13;
associations do not possess, the productive investments financed by the NRDP have generated&#13;
higher family production and incomes and created jobs. In addition, certain types of infrastructure&#13;
and social subprojects, resulting in the provision of cleaner water and/or better sanitary&#13;
conditions, have had an important beneficial impact on the health of recipient families -- and can&#13;
lead to substantial savings in terms of medical assistance, which is another responsibility of the&#13;
municipalities.&#13;
17.   The above results were also found in Maranhao, except for specific groups of productive&#13;
subprojects which will be discussed below. In this state, an evaluation of "Projeto Comunidade&#13;
Viva" (as the reformulated NRDP is known in Maranhao) was carried out in late 1996, just a&#13;
month before the project was to close.3 A number of completed community subprojects,&#13;
belonging to many types of investments, were surveyed in detail. Of these, ten major types, of&#13;
which an abbreviated description is presented below, account for over 90% of all subprojects&#13;
approved. For each, aggregate SSW data on the number of subprojects implemented, total&#13;
beneficiaries and average cost per beneficiary are shown in Table 7. Additionally, financial and&#13;
economic analyses were undertaken for some of the productive subprojects, whose results are&#13;
presented in Annex J.&#13;
3 Although NRDP's generic name in Brazil is PAPP (Programa de apolo ao pequeno produtor), the program&#13;
is also known by another local name in most of the participating states.&#13;

Infrastructure Subprojects&#13;
As in other participating states, rural infrastructure constituted the major category&#13;
of investments requested by NRDP communities in Maranhlo. A dominant type, found less&#13;
frequently than rural electrification and water supply in other states, was the localized&#13;
rehabilitation of rural roads, which accounted for 26% of all subprojects approved in Maranhio.&#13;
(a)    Localized road rehabilitation. Due to limited State/municipal resources for basic.&#13;
infrastructure and its maintenance, access roads in rural areas in Maranwo are often in&#13;
precarious condition. Some communities can find themselves completely isolated from&#13;
the municipal capital or neighboring small towns, where schools, health and other&#13;
essential services are located, and where they can find more employment opportunities&#13;
as well as markets for their produce. Demand was therefore high for NRDP funds to&#13;
finance localized improvements to rural roads, often complemented by rehabilitation of&#13;
small bridges and culverts. Relatively low-cost (US$29,000 on average), this type of&#13;
subproject reached a large number of beneficiaries, with a positive impact both on the&#13;
local economy and the lives of families residing in the assisted areas. Throughout the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-                          AnnexfB&#13;
state, 790 such subprojects were implemented, each benefiting some 144 households or&#13;
a total of about 114,000 rural families.&#13;
(b)   Rural electrification. Frequently, remote rural areas in Maranhao, as in most&#13;
Northeast states, are not connected to the main electricity network. NRDP helped&#13;
to install electrification in villages and/or communities, which improved the quality&#13;
of life of rural dweilers by giving them access to radio, television and the use of&#13;
domestic appliances. Electrification also generated productive activities, created&#13;
additional employment and increased incomes of local shops, businesses and agro-&#13;
industries. In total, about 96,000 families benefited from the 633 rural electrification&#13;
subprojects financed by the program in Maranhao.&#13;
(c)   Rural water supply. Although Maranhao is outside the "drought polygon" and as&#13;
such is less vulnerable to drought than other Northeast states, some parts of the&#13;
state --particularly those adjacent to the sertdo in the neighboring state of Piaui-&#13;
have scarce water resources. Water supply works implemented (such as&#13;
communal wells, reservoirs and fountains) differ according to local conditions. They&#13;
provide, mostly for domestic use and human consumption, a precious resource which&#13;
previously was obtained only through long hours of walking or had to be supplied by&#13;
the municipality (para. 14). They lead to savings in time, effort and cost, and to&#13;
improved health through better sanitation - these gains are often cited by the&#13;
beneficiaries as one of the major benefits accruing from NRDP water supply&#13;
subprojects. In MaranhMo, NRDP water supply systems are also frequently utilized to&#13;
irrigate communal vegetable gardens (hortas), which contribute to improving the&#13;
nutritional status of beneficiaries. Some 53,600 families benefited from the 421 water&#13;
supply subprojects that were implemented in the state under the refornulated NRDP.&#13;
Productive Subprojects&#13;
The experience with productive subprojects, which represented less than a third of&#13;
NRDP investments in the state, has been mixed in Maranhao. The more traditional types, based&#13;
on agro-processing of food crops such as rice and manioc, have generally been successful in&#13;
increasing local production and incomes of recipient families. One specific type, more rarely&#13;
found in other states, also contributed to raising beneficiary incomes but often in an unsustainable&#13;
manner: this was the provision of farm inputs over a limited period (one or two cropping&#13;
seasons). Such subprojects were eventually stopped by the TU following its own evaluation of&#13;
their outcome. Finally, political decision led to the financing of a clothes-making complex in the&#13;
municipality of Rosario, a joint venture with foreign investors which was designed to generate&#13;
several thousand jobs for poor local communities. However, initial results were disappointing,&#13;
prompting the State Government to take remedial measures that should improve the outcome of&#13;
the subprojects.&#13;
(a)   Rice mills. Rice being one of the main crops in Maranhio, there is high demand&#13;
for communal processing units or mini-usinas de arroz. These typically consist of&#13;
a shed, which communities help to build with their own labor and materials, and a&#13;
milling equipment which is simple, low-cost (about US$11,000) and easy to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                       Annex B&#13;
operate, usually by a wage-earning employee. Association members contribute to&#13;
the operation and maintenance of the mill by paying a monthly association fee, a&#13;
user fee (conga) representing a certain percentage of the quantity of rice milled by&#13;
each individual, and eventual supplementary contributions in case of extraordinary&#13;
maintenance. Surplus rice remaining after family consumption is sold on local&#13;
markets. Some 140 rice mills were financed in Maranhao, benefiting nearly 10,000&#13;
rural families.&#13;
(b)   Manioc flour mills. As in the rest of the Northeast, casas defarinha are a&#13;
familiar structure in rural Maranhao, where manioc is consumed primarily in the&#13;
form of flour. The main benefits from this type of subproject are reduced&#13;
processing costs (plus, in some cases, savings in transport to other mills located&#13;
outside the community), leading to increased production both for sale and family&#13;
consumption. Where there is no other mill in the area, community-owned casas de&#13;
farinha replace home-based processing which is done in an artisanal, time-&#13;
consuming fashion and produces poor quality flour. Because faster processing&#13;
allows the producers more time for planting and harvesting, the installation of&#13;
manioc mills is associated with an increase in cultivated areas and in employment,&#13;
both on the farms and in the mills. In total, some 80 manioc flour mills were&#13;
financed by the reformulated NRDP in Maranhao, benefiting about 6,000 families.&#13;
(c)  ]Inputs for campos agrfcolas. This type of productive subproject consisted of&#13;
providing agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers etc.) to groups of farmers over a&#13;
short agricultural season or year. This served, in effect, as a substitute for formal&#13;
credit --which NRDP communities do not normally have access to for lack of land&#13;
titles and other collateral-- to allow poor farmers to purchase the necessary inputs&#13;
to cultivate, on a communal basis, dry or irrigated land. Where this provided&#13;
beneficiaries with some critically needed resources to continue and maintain&#13;
agricultural production in the face of adverse climatic or marketing conditions,&#13;
campos agricolas financed by NRDP contributed to stabilizing, if not increasing,&#13;
incomes of local farm families during difficult periods. However, the TU&#13;
eventually realized that the one-time provision of inputs which was characteristic&#13;
of this type of subproject was clearly not sustainable, especially when beneficiaries&#13;
were not able to make their own collective arrangements for establishing funds to&#13;
buy inputs for the following seasons, and campos agricolas became ineligible&#13;
under the project.&#13;
(d)   Clothes-making. Most investments in this category (about 8% of the total&#13;
subprojects approved in Maranhao) have been for a group of 180 subprojects&#13;
involving 90 community associations in the municipality of Rosario, as part of a&#13;
shirt-making complex sponsored by the State Government in order to stem high&#13;
local unemployment. The community associations, each with 40 members, own&#13;
the facilities and equipment, which were financed partly by NRDP (through&#13;
matching grants) and partly by Banco do Nordeste (through group credit). They&#13;
also provide labor, originally to be remunerated by a Taiwanese firm which was to&#13;
be responsible for the marketing and operation of the complex. Early estimates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                       Annex B&#13;
indicated that only 70% of the 3,600 beneficiaries initially envisaged would end up&#13;
being employed; and that even these were likely to earn a net salary, according to&#13;
the Taiwanese firm's own production and wage estimates, that was well below the&#13;
official minimum wage. The World Bank, which was not informed when the&#13;
Rosario subprojects were approved, and had already forestalled similar ventures in&#13;
several other states, subsequently agreed with the state that their impact on the&#13;
community associations would be closely monitored, measures would be initiated&#13;
to prevent involved communities from being penalized, and that the state would&#13;
desist from repeating such ventures. At the beginning of 1997, training of the&#13;
association members by the Taiwanese firm was suspended, and the relations&#13;
between the two parties started to deteriorate. The State Government intervened&#13;
by contracting a local NGO to resume training and support the associations in&#13;
institutional and administrative matters as well as financial management. While the&#13;
future role of the Taiwanese firm in the undertaking is being re-assessed by the&#13;
State, the first stage of production is expected to start in June 1997, some six&#13;
months behind the original schedule.&#13;
(e)   Tractors for communal use. As in other states, farming communities in&#13;
MaranMo seek financing for tractors which they can use on a group basis to&#13;
mechanize cultivation and expand the areas cropped (mostly with rice, manioc,&#13;
maize, beans and horticultural crops). The use of tractors and implements helps to&#13;
increase crop yields and productivity, often resulting in significant gains:in the&#13;
production and incomes of the beneficiaries. These, small farmers and tenants, had&#13;
to depend previously on a few privately-owned tractors whose services are costlier&#13;
and often not available for all at the required time. The 132 tractor subprojects&#13;
that were financed by the reformulated NRDP in Maranhao are benefiting about&#13;
5,650 families whose incremental incomes are estimated to be about US$1,400 per&#13;
year (see Annex J).&#13;
Social Subprojects&#13;
In Maranhao NRDP investments of a social nature were predominantly for house&#13;
improvement and day care centers, followed by a few subprojects to rehabilitate rural schools and&#13;
health posts.&#13;
(a)   Health-related house improvement. As in other states, rural dwellings often are&#13;
in poor condition and lack hygiene. This inevitably leads to health problems&#13;
including the fatal Chagas disease, spread by an insect favoring wall materials of&#13;
traditional rural houses. In total, 110 house improvement subprojects were&#13;
implemented in Maranhao, with a notable impact on the living and health&#13;
conditions of the 4,800 beneficiary families.&#13;
(b)   Day care centers. Creches are a particularly helpful investment for women. By&#13;
freeing the mothers from child care responsibilities during the day, these&#13;
subprojects increase the capacity of mothers to work and earn additional income.&#13;
Other benefits include an increase in their time for food preparation, educational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-                         AnnexB&#13;
and leisure activities. Some 32 day care centers were financed in Maranhao,&#13;
benefiting about 3,100 rural families.&#13;
Graduation&#13;
18.   By improving the quality of life and economic and social conditions of beneficiaries, the&#13;
NRDP initiated a process of accumulation at both the local and household levels, providing&#13;
beneficiaries with a jump-start and ensuring a degree of sustainability absent from previous&#13;
development efforts in the Northeast. As found in the University of Michigan study (para. 5(b)),&#13;
socio-economic conditions in the communities that were reached by the program improved&#13;
notably. In particular, NRDP-funded investments accelerated the post-1993 drought recovery of&#13;
these communities, and provided them with incentives to use land more intensively. While rural&#13;
infrastructure and social subprojects have ameliorated, sometimes dramatically, living standards of&#13;
beneficiary families, they also have, along with productive subprojects, generated employment not&#13;
only for heads of rural households but also other members such as women, and led to improved&#13;
welfare and increased, more stable, family incomes. The program thus contributed to elevating&#13;
the economic conditions of beneficiaries above those generally found with rural communities in&#13;
the Northeast, providing them with initial start-up funds and allowing them to generate savings&#13;
both for financing other investments and accessing formal credit. In addition, a notable feature of&#13;
the NRDP was to promote resource mobilization at the municipal level, as demonstrated by the&#13;
financial participation of municipalities in the program, particularly in Maranhao (para. 11).&#13;
19.   Given the relatively high IERRs of some productive subprojects (Annex J), it could be&#13;
argued that these cases would have been better attended through credit rather than through a&#13;
grant mechanism. However, the rural poor in the Northeast --the target group of the&#13;
reformulated NRDP-- generally have very limited access to credit for such micro-ventures. As an&#13;
alternative to credit, the grant mechanism provided the NRDP beneficiary communities with the&#13;
means to accumulate benefits at the local level and generate savings, which they could use to&#13;
leverage with the financial sector to obtain credit for additional investments and eventually&#13;
graduate out of the program. However, determination of the variables that should count most&#13;
when deciding to graduate a given community or municipality from the program requires careful&#13;
study.&#13;
ADVANTAGES OF FUMAC OVER PAC&#13;
20.   While the pilot nature of FUMAC under the reformulated NRDP necessarily limited its&#13;
area of intervention, experience to date demonstrates that this component was successful and&#13;
should be expanded. The FUMAC approach clearly achieved greater community participation&#13;
and transparency than PAC and helped strengthen the capacity of communities to select and&#13;
implement subprojects. Although socio-economic benefits produced by the two components were&#13;
similar in many respects, there was enough evidence, as found in Kottak and Costa's follow-up&#13;
study (1994), to assert that greater community participation and transparency in decision-making&#13;
were achieved through FUMAC, since subproject proposals were deliberated not only by the&#13;
community but also by the project Municipal Council at open public meetings. Not only did&#13;
awareness of the program and its requirements appear to be stronger with FUMAC communities&#13;
than with PAC communities, but participation in decision-making was also found to be higher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59 -                        Annex B&#13;
with the first group. Generally, as a result of better selection and prioritization by the&#13;
beneficiaries through the Municipal Council forum, FUMAC subprojects were able to meet the&#13;
program's criteria better than PAC subprojects. This more rigorous process in FUMAC also&#13;
contributed to an increased capacity by communities in FUMAC municipalities to identify, plan&#13;
and implement subprojects. In addition, the stronger and more capable Municipal Councils served&#13;
as catalysts to increase community organization.&#13;
21.  In the majority of Northeast states, local governments and communities have also been&#13;
highly committed to the FUMAC approach. The success of FUMAC can be gauged by the large&#13;
degree of acceptance and commitment of both local governments and communities which, in most&#13;
states, adhered to its principles of consensus building and local development planning -- the latter&#13;
being in its most advanced state in Maranhao (para. 25). In some of the states, a number of&#13;
municipalities, first participating under PAC, spontaneously chose to establish "FUMAC-like"&#13;
Councils, where local priorities were discussed and collective decisions made on subproject&#13;
submissions before these were forwarded to the TUs.&#13;
The FUMAC Experience in Maranhao&#13;
22.   The experience of FUMAC in Maranhao has been diverse and enriching, both in terms of&#13;
achievements and lessons learned. At the beginning of the reformulated NRDP, 12 FUMAC&#13;
municipal councils were set up to implement this pilot component throughout the state. In 1995,&#13;
their creation was accelerated by the TU which, faced with shortages of state counterpart funds,&#13;
decided to encourage the municipalities to actively participate not only in the execution but also in&#13;
the financing of the program. As a result, 31 other municipalities formed their own FUMAC&#13;
councils, but these lacked sufficient knowledge of the program and appropriate training (which&#13;
the TU had no capacity to provide in such a short time). The hasty establishment and&#13;
unpreparedness of some of these councils translated into less than satisfactory performance,&#13;
particularly in the process of subproject selection and approval, forcing the TU to "de-activate"&#13;
19, or more than 40% of the FUMAC councils constituted, in early 1996.&#13;
23.   The TU then concentrated its efforts on mobilizing rural communities and on training the&#13;
remaining FUMAC councils (2 more were established since, bringing the total of FUMAC&#13;
municipalities to 26 at the end of 1996). Most of the training was conducted in the form of&#13;
seminars or workshops which were attended by members of different communities and councils,&#13;
and where participatory techniques were used to stimulate discussions and allow for exchanges of&#13;
experiences and collective problem solving. The approach has been fairly successful, although&#13;
local circumstances such as the level of organization of the communities and/or the attitude of the&#13;
municipal authorities tended to prevail on the degree of transparency and representativeness in&#13;
which FUMAC operated in the various municipalities.&#13;
24.   Of the FUMAC councils in the state, 14 have graduated into so-called "decentralized"&#13;
FUMAC councils. These have their own legal status, maintain their own bank accounts, enter&#13;
into contractual arrangements with the TU for the disbursement of subproject funds, oversee the&#13;
utilization of these funds by the beneficiary community associations, authorize payments to&#13;
contractors and finally, supervise the execution of subprojects on the ground. Some of these&#13;
FUMAC councils, having reached a high level of organizational and operational autonomy, are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60-                         Anne B&#13;
ideal candidates for a prpgram in which they would be devolved financial autonomy as well. Such&#13;
a program, called FUMAC-P, has been introduced on a pilot basis in the new Rural Poverty&#13;
Alleviation Projects in Bahia, Ceari and other states. Its distinguishing feature from the original&#13;
FUMAC is that it decentralizes financial management down to the Municipal Councils,&#13;
transferring the responsibility for managing subproject funds to those councils that have proven&#13;
capacity and, possibly but not- necessarily, have performed well under FUMAC. Each year the&#13;
councils would receive a budget envelope corresponding to subprojects identified and prioritized&#13;
by their communities, and included in an annual operating plan which they would have prepared&#13;
and submitted to the TU the previous year.&#13;
25.   Along with only one or two other NRDP states, Maranhao piloted the preparation of&#13;
municipal development plans. With technical assistance from the TU and IICA, three of the&#13;
municipalities with FUMAC councils (Guimaraes, Fortaleza dos Nogueiras and Matoes - the last&#13;
two being "decentralized" FUMACs) produced their first development plans, the result of a&#13;
collective, consultative effort involving representatives of local government and civil society&#13;
including the communities. The plans themselves are imperfect documents and, because they&#13;
were prepared before the recent municipal elections, they may not be acknowledged by the newly-&#13;
installed municipal administrations in the three municipalities. However, developing the plans&#13;
constituted an unprecedented opportunity for the local stakeholders to analyze potentials and&#13;
constraints in an integrated manner and to identify and plan priorities for investment, matching&#13;
them against possible sources of financing including NRDP. As such, it was a useful learning&#13;
process not only for the municipalities but also for the TU, which will be refining the methodology&#13;
used to prepare the plans before replicating the experience to other municipalities in the state.&#13;
26.   Another achievement was to initiate the application of the FUMAC delivery mechanism to&#13;
indigenous populations in Maranhao, starting with the establishment of an indigenous FUMAC&#13;
council in the municipality of Barra do Corda. This council is composed of representatives of&#13;
various ethnic groups living in three reserves demarcated by the national agency FUNAI&#13;
(Fundapdo Nacional do Indio), within a total area of about 153,000 ha. Both the level of&#13;
organization and discipline, and performance of the indigenous FUMAC council have been&#13;
strikingly good. Like other FUMAC councils, the indigenous council is legally constituted, has an&#13;
executive director and secretary, a general assembly and a "fiscal" committee. It meets on a&#13;
regular basis to discuss and prioritize investment proposals. Before each meeting, council&#13;
members visit eommunities that they represent to check on the legitimacy of the proposals. The&#13;
council contracted local firms or individuals for technical assistance and for preparation and&#13;
implementation of NRDP subprojects, and was discussing with the TU a revised version of the&#13;
Project Operational Manual with the aim of tailoring it specifically to the needs of indigenous&#13;
communities. While it received full support and material assistance (transport and sundries) from&#13;
the local office of FUNAI, the indigenous council was completely autonomous in its decision-&#13;
making processes.&#13;
27.   By late 1996, the indigenous council of Barra do Corda had endorsed --and forwarded to&#13;
the TU for final approval-- 35 community subprojects, distributed equally between basic&#13;
infrastructure (in particular for roads improvement, a pressing need in a region where council&#13;
members have to travel several hours from their communities to meet in the municipal center) and&#13;
productive subprojects (manioc flour mills, rice mills and some irrigated fruit production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61-                        Annex B&#13;
development). Principally because of the TU's slowness to respond and the difficulties it&#13;
encountered in traveling to these areas to appraise subproject submissions in the field, only four of&#13;
the subprojects had been approved for financing as of late 1996. The 35 subproject proposals&#13;
submitted to the indigenous council of Barra do Corda represent about 70% of total demand by&#13;
indigenous communities living in four municipalities in the state (Amarante do Maranhao, Arame&#13;
and Grajau, in addition to Barra do Corda itselt). Demand by communities in the other three&#13;
municipalities was channeled through "regular" FUMAC councils, representing non-indigenous as&#13;
well as indigenous communities.&#13;
28.   The positive experience of the indigenous FUMAC council of Barra do Corda should be&#13;
replicated to other indigenous areas in the state. Experience to date has shown that the felt needs&#13;
and aspirations of indigenous communities are voiced more efficiently and with more positive&#13;
results within a forum composed of representatives of communities sharing the same cultural&#13;
identity and types of problems, rather than one that represents other communities as well.&#13;
However, serious social conflicts have risen in other indigenous areas of the state such as Grajai,&#13;
creating serious security risks for "outsiders" and a difficult working environment for the TU.&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT OF SUBPROJECTS&#13;
29.   A technical evaluation carried out by the Bank in late 1994 found that works executed&#13;
under the program in all participating states were generally of good quality, especially when&#13;
implemented by private contractors (about 75% of PAC and FUMAC subprojects). For the&#13;
remaining 25% of subprojects (20% executed by municipalities, with unskilled labor often&#13;
provided by beneficiaries, and 5% implemented by the communities themselves), the quality varied&#13;
but remained generally fair to good. Only for a very small proportion (less than 5% of all&#13;
subprojects) was construction quality rated as poor. In Maranhao, a more recent survey was&#13;
conducted by the TU on major types of works implemented in the state (all by local contractors&#13;
for infrastructure subprojects, and largely by the communities themselves for construction related&#13;
to productive subprojects like manioc flour or rice mills). The survey found that, overall, the&#13;
quality was good in about 58% of the subprojects, fair in 30% and unsatisfactory in 12%. Rural&#13;
electrification subprojects were of the highest quality (80% good, 20% fair), while construction of&#13;
less than a third of water supply systems was rated unsatisfactory (against 43% good and 27%&#13;
fair).&#13;
30.   Because of their relatively small size, PAC/FUMAC subprojects generally do not produce&#13;
significant effects on the environment. However, certain types of projects, by their very nature,&#13;
produce environmentally undesirable by-products (e.g., from the processing of manioc) or lead to&#13;
increased use of products that may have a negative environmental impact (including fertilizers and&#13;
pesticides associated with the use of tractors, wood for fuel in manioc and rice mitls). Greater&#13;
consideration will have to be given to these aspects in the successor project to the NRDP in&#13;
Maranhio, following the example of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects now under&#13;
implementation in Bahia and other Northeast states.&#13;

INSTIrUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
31.   A participatory, demand-driven program addressing a large target population such as the&#13;
reformulated NRDP, involves many actors and stakeholders. The analysis of the performance of&#13;
each of these groups, although varying among the states, yields a generally favorable picture. The&#13;
clientelistic approach traditionally found in the Northeast remains prevalent in some specific areas&#13;
but, by and large, the program, by promoting transparency and consensus building as well as&#13;
enhancing the capacity of communities to address and prioritize their own needs, succeeded in&#13;
reducing the incidence of politicization and in particular the use of project resources for political&#13;
or personal purposes. In cases where this has happened, as in the Rosario complex in Maranhlo&#13;
(para. 17(d)), close and permanent monitoring by the Bank and commitment of the state to adopt&#13;
appropriate solutions, are required.&#13;
32.   When they are properly mobilized and share a common sense of purpose, community&#13;
associations generally function well. Collective responsibilities such as appointment of office-&#13;
holders, payment of dues or user fees and accounting are met by the members, particularly of&#13;
those associations which are well organized, as in Minas Gerais or Paraiba where many date back&#13;
to the start of the original NRDP. On the other hand, some community associations were formed&#13;
with the objective of requesting financing for a needed subproject, and did not have significant&#13;
organizational experience at the outset. Such weak associations tended to be easily exploited by&#13;
politicians and/or intermediaries, usually under PAC. Where the consensus-building mechanism&#13;
existed at the municipal level through FUMAC, the outcome was generally favorable, especially&#13;
when mayors facilitated the spread of information about the project and provided the conditions&#13;
necessary for communities to capitalize on project benefits which met their basic needs. In&#13;
Maranhao, notable cases include the communities of Guimaraes and Vit6ria do Mearim, which&#13;
were able to generate their own investment proposals and follow up on their implementation&#13;
through well performing FUMAC Councils, in which the Church and/or supportive mayors&#13;
actively participated.&#13;
33.  In all ten states, community associations share a common need for technical assistance.&#13;
Not only is this essential for the organizational development of newly-formed associations, but it&#13;
is needed to assist all associations during the entire subproject cycle, from preparation to&#13;
implementation and O&amp;M of subprojects. The need for training and technical assistance was&#13;
more acute for productive subprojects, where inadequate O&amp;M was often the result of lack of&#13;
technical know-how on the part of the communities in the absence of follow-up by the TUs.&#13;
Better access to organizational and management training wili also contribute to the sustainability&#13;
of both community organizations and subprojects.&#13;
34.   The FUMAC Municipal Councils have been the focal point of the program's&#13;
decentralization strategy and must be protected from political interference which would&#13;
undermine the demand-driven nature of such a program. In FUMAC, the Municipal Councils&#13;
review and discuss in a public forum the communities' subproject requests and forward these to&#13;
the TU in priority order for financing. The Councils are generally chaired by the mayors and&#13;
comprise representatives from both public and non-governmental agencies and community&#13;
associations. Development and performance of the project FUMAC Municipal Councils was&#13;
clearly afTected by the attitude of the local political power base, especially that of the mayor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                       Annex B&#13;
Usually, mayors were supportive and the disparate interests represented in the FUMAC councils&#13;
found a modus vivendi. In some of the participating states, mayors even generalized the FUMAC&#13;
approach to decision-making on allocation of non-project resources as well. Nevertheless, while&#13;
political influence can work to the advantage of the Councils by facilitating the subproject&#13;
approval process and forging mutual benefits for project Councils and municipal governments,&#13;
this same influence can undermine the demand-driven nature of the project if left unchecked or&#13;
when community groups are not strong or cohesive enough. In Maranhao, an example of this was&#13;
found in Guimaries, where the previous mayor worked hand in hand with the local FUMAC&#13;
Municipal Council and where, with one or two exceptions, the community subprojects financed by&#13;
NRDP were performing satisfactorily. The present mayor, on the other hand, is reputedly less&#13;
open to consultation and participation. The communities, while apprehensive about the risks of&#13;
negative interference or open opposition by the new mayor, stated that they would continue with&#13;
FUMAC and resist any attempt to subvert the FUMAC Council.&#13;
35.   The participation and support of rural municipal governments is important for&#13;
sustainability and should be encouraged, but with sufficient safeguards against negative political&#13;
influence. While the project Municipal Councils act independently of municipal governments, the&#13;
participation and support of the latter is nonetheless important. Rural municipal governments&#13;
have limited financial resources with which to invest in rural communities and, hence, the&#13;
reformulated NRDP served as an important source of funds at the local level to bridge the gap in&#13;
public resources for investment in poor rural communities. Mayors and municipal leaders viewed&#13;
the project as a welcome source of additional resources for investment to meet basic community&#13;
needs to which their municipal budgets could not realistically attend. For the most part, mayors,&#13;
municipal legislature members (vereadores) and municipal administrations supported and&#13;
participated in NRDP. Maranhao constitutes the best example where municipal governments&#13;
provided the counterpart funds which the financially strapped state governments were unable to&#13;
supply. In fact, in this state, financial contributions by interested municipalities were increasingly&#13;
imposed by the TU as a condition for participating in NRDP. Although this attests to the capacity&#13;
of the program to leverage local municipal resources, this practice tended to penalize the poorer&#13;
municipalities as well as opened the NRDP to political haggling by some powerful and well-off&#13;
mayors. Indeed, the Bank stopped project disbursements for several months in late 1995 when it&#13;
became aware of some bargaining between the State authorities and certain mayors for&#13;
subprojects to be funded by the program. Overall, the net result of this practice has been a&#13;
relative concentration of subprojects in 14 municipalities (about 11% of all eligible municipalities),&#13;
which together received about 35% of all NRDP community subproject funds in the state.&#13;
36.   Technical Units need assistance to streamline operational procedures and strengthen&#13;
project supervision. The state-level TU has been the focal point for project administration and the&#13;
project's principal liaison for the Municipal Councils and for those community associations&#13;
located in PAC municipalities. TUs are generally autonomous entities attached to the State&#13;
Planning Secretariat (except for Rio Grande do Norte where the TU is responsible to another&#13;
State Secretariat). Most have established field offices, each with one or more technicians.&#13;
Maran}o is a notable exception, with a TU of only 36 technicians and 22 administrative staff,&#13;
operating exclusively out of the state capital. Given the large size of the state (over 333,000&#13;
kn2) and its distribution into different agroecological micro-regions, the TU is obviously too&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64 -                        Annex B&#13;
small. In particular, manpower limitations made it difficult for the TU to operationalize its rules&#13;
of conducting field investigations of potential subprojects before approving them --a necessity&#13;
ignored by the previous TU-- and of closely supervising their execution. Another problem was&#13;
the inadequacy of the formal structure of the TU, inherited from the previous administration, with&#13;
the way in which the various units and departments actually operated and worked together. This&#13;
last constraint appears to have been solved by changes in the TU structure, formalized by a recent&#13;
(April 1997) decree issued by the state Governor.&#13;
37.   Despite their size (generally 40-60 technicians), TUs found it hard to process the large&#13;
number of subproject proposals and to provide technical assistance for the preparation and&#13;
implementation of subprojects. Because the process of appraising subprojects and, in particular,&#13;
that of negotiating terms of agreement with beneficiary associations was time-consuming, not all&#13;
of the subprojects approved yearly (up to 1,000 per state) were actually funded the same year. In&#13;
addition, supervision of subprojects was weak given the logistical constraints of visiting a large&#13;
number of subprojects. Project technical assistance to the TUs was mostly contracted from&#13;
intemational and bilateral agencies such as IICA, GTZ and FAO.&#13;
38.   The successful cases of NGOs and other technical assistance providers participating in&#13;
the reformulated NRDP need to be replicated. One solution to the problem of the TUs' inability&#13;
to provide sufficient technical assistance and to supervise the large number of subprojects, has&#13;
been for the TUs to contract NGOs to fulfill these tasks, as has been done successfully in Rio&#13;
Grande do Norte with various organizations grouped together under the Forum do Campo, or to&#13;
forge alliances with other technical assistance providers as in Minas Gerais. In this latter state,&#13;
EMATER provides high quality agricultural extension services and has been more supportive and&#13;
successful than in other states in contributing to income-generating productive subprojects.&#13;
However, even where there was no official alliance between the TU and EMATER, NRDP was&#13;
supported by individual extensionists adpersonam. In Maranhao, the TU intends to expand its&#13;
collaboration --to date limited-- with NGOs, some of which have several years experience with&#13;
working with rural communities in certain municipalities throughout the state but are short of&#13;
staff.&#13;
39.   The World Bank Recife Office plays a fundamental role in the coordination and&#13;
supervision of the ten state projects under the reformulated NRDP. The Bank's office in Recife&#13;
(Pernambuco) has three task managers dedicated exclusively to working with the participating&#13;
states, some of which, like Bahia and Maranhao, are quite large. By delegating all supervision&#13;
activities to the Recife Office, including procurement reviews and field visits, Bank support is&#13;
better tailored to the decentralized structure of the reformulated NRDP.&#13;
Summary Institutional Assessment&#13;
40.  Institutional analysis shows that, by assigning greater responsibility and influence to local&#13;
level organizations and municipal governments, the reformulated NRDP's primary achievement&#13;
has been to support a decentralized approach to resource allocation and the creation of social&#13;
capital in the rural areas of the Northeast. After three years of implementation of the&#13;
reformulated program, it is possible to draw a number of conclusions about its institutional&#13;
arrangements and performance. The capacity of both communities and municipal governments to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65 -                        Annex B&#13;
prioritize investment decisions was strengthened by the subproject development and approval&#13;
process inherent in the program. The NRDP provided a fiscal incentive to decentralized decision-&#13;
making, since local level decisions were backed by inflows of project resources. The FUIMAC&#13;
approach, in particular, not only placed the power to prioritize community investment proposals&#13;
with local level organizations but also introduced transparency into the resource allocation&#13;
process for rural investments at the municipal level, thereby minimizing the traditional, clientelistic&#13;
approach. FUMAC provides a forum, which did not exist before, for local government&#13;
representatives and community representatives to discuss investment needs and priorities. As&#13;
FUMAC spreads beyond the pilot phase and as municipalities gain more years of experience with&#13;
the mechanism, municipal governments will become more accustomed to participatory decision-&#13;
making processes, and rural community associations will continue to exercise their voice and&#13;
choice.&#13;
41.   The reformulated NRDP was nonetheless vulnerable to political interference, particularly&#13;
where local level organizations such as community associations and FUMAC Municipal Councils&#13;
were newly established, lacked sufficient information, or were without adequate technical&#13;
assistance and training, factors needing to be addressed in follow-up projects. Experience under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP demonstrates that there is a fine line between participation of local&#13;
political leaders in the program, which is strongly encouraged, and politicization of the program.&#13;
Politicization occurs when transparency breaks down, which can happen if information about the&#13;
project is not widely and carefully disseminated, or when project internal controls are not&#13;
enforced, such as with weak supervision by the TUs or insufficient external support from NGOs&#13;
or other third parties to monitor project implementation. As municipalities increase their&#13;
contributions to the financing of NRDP investments, greater vigilance will be required to ensure&#13;
that the demand-driven nature of the project is not sacrificed. Also, the FUMAC approach, which&#13;
instills greater transparency into the program's resource allocation process, can fall prey to&#13;
political interference if community representation on the Councils is insufficient. In addition,&#13;
where technical assistance and training is inadequate, sustainability of the investments is more&#13;
precarious since operation and maintenance of the investments requires certain skill sets which&#13;
may not exist in some communities. Increased "on the job" training to community associations is&#13;
vital to ensure their sustainability, particularly of newly-formed associations.&#13;
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
42.   The generally satisfactory performance of the reformulated NRDP and its favorable impact&#13;
on the lives and incomes of beneficiaries show that after several decades of experience with rural&#13;
development efforts in the Northeast, a good measure of success has been achieved in effectively&#13;
reaching the rural poor with targeted interventions. Some of the most positive results can be&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
* The reformulated NRDP put in place objective conditions for the organization of poor&#13;
communities in the ten participating states. In some of these states, organized rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66 -                        Annex B&#13;
communities have shown that they can influence the allocation and use of municipal&#13;
financial resources in such a way as to favor the rural poor.&#13;
*  The program fostered the institutional and financial commitment of local governments&#13;
to its decentralized approach to addressing the needs of the rural poor. A large&#13;
number of municipalities, although not legally required either under PAC or FUMAC,&#13;
provided financial and other types of assistance to approved community subprojects.&#13;
In addition, in some states, mayors readily adopted the FUMAC approach and&#13;
instituted it for decision-making on non-project investments at the municipal level.&#13;
*  Investments funded by the program have, to a large extent, (a) satisfied real&#13;
community needs; (b) been of good or satisfactory technical quality and (c) been&#13;
relatively less costly than those executed by public authorities (municipal, state and&#13;
federal).&#13;
*  Beneficiary communities have adhered enthusiastically to the program; such&#13;
enthusiasm translated into participation in the execution and in contributing to the&#13;
costs of operation and maintenance of the investments, enhancing their sense of&#13;
ownership of the subprojects.&#13;
*  Although the reformulated NRDP did not incorporate instruments for structural&#13;
changes in the agriculture of the Northeast, it proved to be a valuable approach for&#13;
reaching and assisting a large number of landless families -- usually excluded from the&#13;
target groups of many other programs, including the original NRDP. Further, land&#13;
reform beneficiaries became a very active clientele of the reformulated program, as it&#13;
provided them with opportunities to satisfy investment needs other than those&#13;
received through the government's land reform program.&#13;
-  In the majority of FUMAC participating municipalities, there are encouraging signs&#13;
that the "clientelistic" approach traditionally used in the Northeast to satisfy&#13;
community needs is gradually giving way to a more genuinely participatory and&#13;
transparent approach. This transparency in decision-making has allowed a built-in&#13;
mechanism of "social control" over investments using public funds.&#13;
43.   Nevertheless, the program could be further improved by introducing modifications to its&#13;
design, which would rectify those deficiencies that have been identified and would improve&#13;
project implementation and performance. In Maranhao, divergence from the principles of&#13;
transparency and accountability promoted by NRDP has been detected --and recognized by the&#13;
State-- in the case of the Rosario clothes-making complex, as have been the negative trade-offs&#13;
from municipal contributions into the program (para. 35). However, the TU is fully committed to&#13;
preventing such cases from recurring. It also put in special efforts in the past two years to: (a)&#13;
improve the operational aspects of the program, e.g., more rigorous analysis of subproject&#13;
proposals coupled with more frequent and systematic field supervision, stricter control of use of&#13;
subproject funds by communities, review of subproject types financed in the past so as to&#13;
eliminate those that are not meeting the program's criteria or not producing sustainable benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                       Annex B&#13;
Unfortunately, these improvements did not prevent strong political pressure by the State&#13;
authorities to use NRDP resources to finance the Rosario subprojects; (b) reach out and provide&#13;
effective technical assistance to indigenous populations, a good example of which is the setting up&#13;
of the Indigenous FUMAC Council in Barra do Corda whose performance and capacity for&#13;
organization are remarkably good; (c) apply participatory methods in training and program&#13;
evaluation; (d) ensure quality in the FUMAC delivery mechanism by de-activating unauthentic or&#13;
under-performing FUMAC Councils; and (e) pilot the preparation of municipal development plans&#13;
in three FUMAC municipalities. Additionally, the TU would have to review its present staffing&#13;
requirements and opt for a more decentralized structure, which would facilitate its mobilization&#13;
and technical assistance work with rural communities in the field. It would also have to expand&#13;
collaborative arrangements with NGOs and/or other entities to assist in these tasks.&#13;
44.   Taken together, the different evaluations of NRDP have brought to light a number of&#13;
lessons, which suggest that the following modifications be made to the design of successor&#13;
projects:&#13;
45.   Expand FUMAC. The projects should expand FUMAC and initiate a pilot municipal&#13;
funds program (FUMAC-P), to promote further decentralization of decision-making to municipal&#13;
and community levels, to relieve the administrative logjam resulting from state intervention in the&#13;
minutiae of subprojects, and to further encourage municipal cost-sharing of subprojects. The&#13;
appraisal and subsequent approval of community subprojects by Municipal Councils under&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P would significantly reduce the role played by TUs in approving&#13;
subprojects --and the bias that this implies-- in the existing program. Also, FUMAC tends to be&#13;
more effective in thwarting political interference because of the increased transparency of its&#13;
subproject approval process over that of PAC. Increasing community representation on the&#13;
Councils to at least 80% of all voting members will help Councils resist overpowering political&#13;
influence.&#13;
46.   Supervision. By the same token, supervision of subprojects by the TUs should be more&#13;
rigorous, including by contracting external assistance as in Rio Grande do Norte where a NGO&#13;
was contracted for this purpose. Supervision, both during and after implementation of the&#13;
subprojects, is an indispensable determinant of their success and sustainability. Increased supervision&#13;
would improve the quality of implementation of subprojects and would help identify and resolve&#13;
potential problems in subproject operation and subsequent maintenance.&#13;
47.   Standard Designs and Appraisal Criteria. For simplicity and efficiency in subproject&#13;
preparation, evaluation and supervision, as well as for minimizing design deficiencies, the Project&#13;
Operational Manuals should establish standard engineering designs, technical and financial&#13;
parameters, and cost indicators for the most frequently requested subprojects. Standardization of&#13;
subproject documents, technical designs and unit costs simplifies the subproject preparation and&#13;
evaluation process, facilitates the procurement of goods and works, prevents overdesign and improves&#13;
the quality of subprojects, encouraging greater participation by poorer communities and reducing&#13;
bottlenecks in the subproject cycle. Also, environmental assessment criteria should be part of the&#13;
Operational Manual and routinely monitored during subproject supervision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-68 -                         Annex B&#13;
48.   Productive Subprojecta. The managerial requirements and profit maximization&#13;
objectives of certain types of productive subprojects are difficult to meet when they are financed&#13;
in a social context and operated and maintained communally as under the NRDP. To ensure&#13;
sustainability, productive subprojects financed by such a program should be subject to rigorous&#13;
selection, preparation, technical assistance and supervision. Eligible productive investments&#13;
should be those that provide services for a large number of community members; whose collective&#13;
use is regulated by strict operational guidelines (regulamento de uso); and for which operation&#13;
and maintenance is assured by charging adequate user fees to both association members and non-&#13;
members.&#13;
49.   Technical Assistance and Training. Funds for technical assistance and training should&#13;
be channeled to rural communities and project Municipal Councils to enable participation of the&#13;
poorest areas, foster community capacity and empowerment, and encourage the active&#13;
participation of able and competent NGOs and local development agencies. Increased technical&#13;
assistance to rural communities also will enable them to identify, prepare and implement their own&#13;
subprojects, thereby augmenting their capacity to compete for investment funds and to operate and&#13;
maintain the subprojects appropriately. In addition, technical assistance activities should be targeted to&#13;
project Municipal Councils to improve their planning, management and financial capacity. Finally, the&#13;
quality and capacity of the Technical Unit is a critical factor in project success, and thus its institutional&#13;
strengthening, which may entail the contracting of international or bilateral aid-funded entities such as&#13;
I[CA or GTZ, as is currently practiced, should receive increased attention. The TUs should actively&#13;
organize all technical assistance and training arrangements under the project and oversee the&#13;
quality of these activities.&#13;
50.   Participation and Transparency. In addition to the above measures, participation and&#13;
transparency should be further enhanced by setting clear rules for the composition and modus&#13;
operandi of project Municipal Councils, with more than 80% of members coming from&#13;
community representatives and local civil society. Greater efforts by the TUs to organize and&#13;
mobilize poor communities are also fundamental in order to enable these communities to&#13;
participate in project benefits.&#13;
51.   Transparency should also be promoted by incorporating a system of operational incentives&#13;
and penalties into the project design. Incentives for positive performance and penalties against&#13;
departures from project guidelines --misappropriation of resources, mistargeting of project&#13;
benefits, faulty subproject design, insufficient community participation or lack of proper O&amp;M--&#13;
should accompany the increased decentralization of resources and decision-making responsibilities&#13;
to beneficiaries and project Municipal Councils through FUMAC and FUMAC-P. This&#13;
framework of incentives and disincentives would require backing by the TUs through ex-post&#13;
control of subproject activities through auditing of accounts, and supervision and monitoring.&#13;
52.   Finally, to minimize the risk of political manipulation and increase participation, the&#13;
Northeast states must better tailor their information campaigns to the rural poor and ensure that&#13;
information about the project, particularly its objectives, operational guidelines and procedures for&#13;
soliciting financing, is widely disseminated to all potential beneficiaries. Better and more widely&#13;
disseminated information campaigns will also increase transparency --stimulating the role of public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                       Annex B&#13;
"watchdogs"-- and will put all communities on a level playing field with respect to access to&#13;
project benefits.&#13;
53.   Sustainability. Through a system of matching grants to poor rural community associations,&#13;
the reformulated NRDP has improved the quality of life and the economic and social conditions of its&#13;
beneficiaries. By providing an initial jump-start to poor communities previously without investment&#13;
capital, the reformulated NRDP initiated a process of local accumulation at the beneficiary and&#13;
community levels and laid the groundwork for sustainable local development. This process will be&#13;
further encouraged through greater finanial participation of municipal governments in subproject&#13;
inestments, a process which has already been launched in several states under the NRDP and should&#13;
be expanded but with appropriate safeguards. Sustainability of the subproject investments themselves&#13;
also has greater potential when the municipalities and communities contribute to the subproject&#13;
financg in a cost-sharing arrangement and when there is increased beneficiary participation.&#13;
Beneficiaiy counterpart contributions should be better quantified and should count toward the global&#13;
counterpart fund requirements. Furthermore, increased technical assistance and training to rural&#13;
communities, as well as stronger supervision by the TUs, will improve the quality of&#13;
implementation of subprojects and stem potential problems in subproject operation and&#13;
maintenance, which can impede sustainability.&#13;
54.   Cost Sharing and Graduation. A strategy should be formalized to graduate&#13;
municipalities and communities from the program, once a certain level of accumulated benefits has&#13;
been reached. A fundamental element of a feasible graduation strategy would be the criteria&#13;
adopted to determine the point of graduation, backed by appropriate data which can be collected&#13;
to implement such a strategy. The strategy would need to carefully consider beneficiaries' access&#13;
to credit as well as monitorable indicators of income levels and local capacity to manage funds, as&#13;
would be demonstrated through mastery of the FUMAC-P approach.&#13;
55.   Monitoring and Evaluation. A user-friendly monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system&#13;
facilitates the subproject evaluation process, provides feedback and necessary information to improve&#13;
targeting and efficiency, and serves as an effective management and planning tool. Project design&#13;
should pay careful attention to baseline studies as the springboard for well-designed M&amp;E and for ex-&#13;
post financial and economic evaluation of productive subprojects. To bolster the measurement of&#13;
overall project impact, the M&amp;E system would need to expand the range of project impact inmcators&#13;
and performance benchmarks. Examples include: increased employment for women, improved health&#13;
and related "savings" to State/municipal budgets; resource mobilization at the local/municipal level; and&#13;
indicators of migration. In addition, the project M&amp;E system must be geared to collect the information&#13;
necessaiy to support a graduation strategy. Therefore, as a condition of loan effectiveness, the&#13;
project M&amp;E system should be improved to reinforce the mechanisms for targeting and to secure&#13;
reliable data for evaluating subproject impact, as well as to facilitate better control and project&#13;
management throughout the subproject cycle by the TUs.&#13;
56.   "Best Practice" Exchanges. Across the ten states of the reformulated NRDP, there exist&#13;
numerous successful interventions that could be replicated to the benefit of the whole program,&#13;
such as the experience with FUMAC Councils in Paraiba, the preparation of municipal&#13;
development plans in Maranhao, EMATER in Minas Gerais or NGOs in Rio Grande do Norte. In&#13;
addition, certain states have adopted technical parameters or have developed training materials&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70 -                        Annex B&#13;
which have produced positive results and should be disseminated throughout the program. Thus,&#13;
"best practice" exchanges should be arranged among the TUs to share successfiul experiences and&#13;
to reward inmovation. At the state level, as is being done in Paraiba, community associations with&#13;
successful subprojects or possessing certain skills should also be encouraged to share these with&#13;
other associations through training seminars and workshops as well as field visits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;
MARANH11O&#13;
C. TARGETING MECHANISMS AND PROJECT&#13;
MUNICIPALITIES&#13;
1.    Targeting of the rural poor is of critical importance in the project, particularly as&#13;
justification for the use of grants for subproject financing. Under the project, it is&#13;
proposed that targeting occur at three levels:&#13;
(a)   geographically by poverty level and other characteristics of the&#13;
municipalities;&#13;
(b)   geographically within municipalities to target rural settlements and&#13;
communities; and,&#13;
(c)   community-based selection of poor beneficiaries and particularly&#13;
vulnerable groups by the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
2.    Municipalities. Targeting at the first and second levels defines the project area.&#13;
All municipalities, with the exception of the metropolitan area of Sao Luis, are included in&#13;
the project area, bringing the total project municipalities to 216. Targeting of these&#13;
municipalities takes into consideration the concentration of income and economic activity&#13;
in the metropolitan area and the higher incidence of poverty in the municipalities of the&#13;
interior, manifested by such indicators as the rate of indigence, availability of municipal&#13;
resources, and other socio-econoniic indicators.' According to IPEA (1993), 88% of the&#13;
project municipalities suffer a rate of indigence greater than 50%.&#13;
3.    During project preparation, the Maranhao PCU refined the project targeting&#13;
methodology in a widely attended and publicized seminar, with the participation of local&#13;
NGOs, universities and public agencies as well as international agencies like UNICEF and&#13;
IICA, to identify the micro-regions/areas in the state which the proposed project should&#13;
focus on. Using a series of targeting criteria, which were based on the Mapa da Fome and&#13;
on the experience derived both from the reformulated NRDP and past or on-going&#13;
programs of the institutions that participated in the seminar, specific areas and&#13;
municipalities were pinpointed for priority action under the proposed project. As a result&#13;
Rate of indigence equals the number of families below the official poverty line established by&#13;
IPEA divided by the total number of families in the municipality. See 0 Mapa da Fome, JPEA,&#13;
March 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79 -                           Annex C&#13;
of the seminar, the PCU produced a detailed map, highlighting 11 principal micro-regions&#13;
for project interventions.&#13;
4.    Within the project municipalities, the selection of PAC and FUMAC municipalities&#13;
will be based on criteria such as past performance under the reformulated NRDP,&#13;
estimation of the organizational capacity of communities within the municipality, and&#13;
"progressiveness" of the mayor and municipal administration. The criteria for selection of&#13;
FUMAC-P municipalities is included in Annex F. As an incentive and basis for a&#13;
reasonable rate of development for FUMAC and FUMAC-P Councils, a minimum of 5&#13;
subprojects would be financed annually for each of these Councils. Adopting this rule and&#13;
based on the average unit cost of NRDP subprojects in Maranhao, amounts initially&#13;
allocated to the two subcomponents would permit the establishment of 116 FUMAC&#13;
Councils and 20 FUMAC-P Councils during the project period.&#13;
5.    Rural Settlements and Communities. The second level of targeting, within&#13;
municipalities, focuses on rural settlements and communities. Beneficiary settlements or&#13;
communities are limited to those with a population under 7,500 people.&#13;
6.    Community-based Selection. The third and principal level of targeting is&#13;
community-based selection. The project assumes that local communities can best judge&#13;
which community groups are poor and what investment priorities are in each municipality&#13;
and/or each community. The process of consensus-building at the local level by project&#13;
Municipal Councils helps to ensure that only poor communities benefit from the project.&#13;
During the open meetings to set priorities, criteria such as the socio-economic situation of&#13;
the participating communities, including existing infrastructure and availability of services,&#13;
would be discussed as part of the ranking of subprojects within the municipality. The&#13;
composition of the Municipal Councils, in which 80% are representatives from rural&#13;
communities and local civil society, as well as the clear and transparent rules and&#13;
procedures for the Councils' functioning, are important elements which facilitate targeting&#13;
poor beneficiaries. Finally, indicative targets set for social subprojects and those which&#13;
benefit women in particular, should be considered by the Municipal Councils as criteria for&#13;
subproject selection, insofar as the principles of need and perceived benefits guide ranking&#13;
decisions.&#13;
7.    The effectiveness of the targeting methodology would be assessed through the&#13;
project monitoring system and though ex-post evaluation studies. For example, annual&#13;
physical performance reviews (Annex H) would monitor the targeting of project benefits.&#13;
Also, the project implementation review (Annex H) would measure the ability of the&#13;
project to target and reach the poor. Adjustments and fine-tuning of the targeting&#13;
methodology would be based on these ex-post reviews, in agreement with the Bank.&#13;

8.    The demand-driven community development model presented in the proposed&#13;
project is expected to increase the income-generating capacity and standards of living in&#13;
the beneficiary communities. Because project resources will be targeted to the poorest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-80 -                          Annex C&#13;
mru  communities, certain communities with better socio-economic standing relative to&#13;
others would receive fewer investment resources during the course of project&#13;
implementation. These comnmnities, able to leverage a critical mass of subprojects and&#13;
other benefits from this and previous Bank-financed and other projects, would gain access&#13;
to other sources of financing and reach a point where a "safety net" is no longer necessary.&#13;
In order to formalize this process, the proposed project would introduce a community&#13;
graduation strategy whereby those communities with demonstrated capacity for&#13;
sustainable asset-accumulation (savings), adequate social and economic infrastructure and&#13;
community organization, would no longer be eligible for project matching grants.&#13;
9.    To make this judgment, baseline profiles of beneficiary communities would be&#13;
developed using indicators of community weln-being collected from community subproject&#13;
proposals. Each subproject proposal would be accompanied by a 'fact sheet' to be filed&#13;
out by the community which would provide indication of the community's socio-economic&#13;
standing. The questions asked would extract information on benefits from previous&#13;
subprojects as well as from NRDP and other public programs, existing infrastructure and&#13;
access to social services, and indicators of accumulation/savings, such as: (a) the average&#13;
income of families in the community, in terms of minimum wages; (b) the average portion&#13;
of this income which families dedicate to buy food; (c) the average portion of farnily&#13;
income dedicated to buying medicines; and (d) the percentage of community households&#13;
which have electricity, which have secure access to water and/or treated water, and which&#13;
have access to a health post. The information contained in the baseline community profiles&#13;
would be incorporated in the MIS, and regularly updated through monitoring and&#13;
supervision exercises.&#13;
10.   At the end of the second year, the project would finance a study to determine the&#13;
point at which a community would be charged a higher cost-sharing percentage as well as&#13;
the "take-oft' point, the point at which a community would graduate out of the project.&#13;
The study would be based on a comparison of community profiles and on information&#13;
from the baseline impact evaluation (see Annex H). Using this analysis, the PCU (for&#13;
PAC) and the Municipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P), with the support of the&#13;
PCU, would graduate those communities which have reached this "take-off' point. As&#13;
communities graduate, those municipalities with fewer eligible communities would&#13;
gradually receive less funding for subprojects and, concurrently, would graduate from the&#13;
project as weli.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;
MARANHAO&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1.    The success of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Project in Maranhlo in meeting its&#13;
stated objectives is dependent on the strength and capabilities of four distinct groups of&#13;
entities: (a) community organizations; (b) project (FUMAC and FUMAC-P) Municipal&#13;
Councils; (c) the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU); and (d) participating governmental and&#13;
non-governmental agencies.&#13;
CoMMTuNrry ORGANZATIONS&#13;
2.    Community associations are the legitirnate representatives of the beneficiaries&#13;
before the Municipal Councils and the State under the project, which will only benefit&#13;
those communities organized into legally-constituted civil associations. This, a&#13;
prerequisite under Brazilian law for associations to receive public funds, also helps ensure&#13;
that the project meets the needs of a representative group from a given community and not&#13;
simply the needs of its more vocal or politically influential constituents. Due to the rather&#13;
cumbersome legal process in Brazil for forming associations, the project only requires that&#13;
the association be legally formed once the subproject proposal has been approved.&#13;
3.    Under local law, the organization of community associations typically comprises an&#13;
Executive Board of Directors, a General Assembly and a Fiscal Council. The Executive&#13;
Board of Directors comprises the President, Secretary, and Treasurer and the&#13;
Coordinators of any special working groups within the Association. These fixed-term&#13;
positions are flled by the vote of the General Assembly which meets regularly every three&#13;
months to discuss and vote on the Association's work program and intemal procedures.&#13;
All decisions made by the General Assembly are registered in official documents (atas)&#13;
and signed by all members present. This procedure is reflected in the identification and&#13;
prioritization of subprojects: a subproject proposal addresses the needs of a majority of&#13;
the association, as voted by its members, and therefore is accompanied by an ata signed by&#13;
the association members. The fiscal council, normally composed of three members,&#13;
supervises all of the association's activities and functions as internal auditor of all financial&#13;
transactions made by the association. The principal source of funds for most associations&#13;
is monthly dues paid by members.&#13;
4.    Community associations are the foundation of project implementation. The&#13;
associations are responsible for formulating and prioritizing ideas for subprojects and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-82 -                           Annex D&#13;
submitting these proposals to the Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-P) or&#13;
to the PCU (under PAC) for financing. The General Assembly deliberates and votes on&#13;
each subproject proposal, thereby ensuring that these subprojects attend to the needs of&#13;
the majority of the association members. The signed ata which accompanies each&#13;
subproject proposal attests to the association's commitment to the subproject. Once a&#13;
subproject has been approved, the community association enters into a legally binding&#13;
agreement with the PCU and/or Municipal Council through which the funds to implement&#13;
the subproject are passed to the association. The association, in most cases, is responsible&#13;
for all procurement and record-keeping during the implementation of the subproject. This&#13;
agreement also binds the association to provide the necessary counterpart contribution&#13;
(which can include labor, materials and cash) to execute the subproject as well as&#13;
undertake the future operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of the investment. In the case of&#13;
infrastructure, the association generally transfers O&amp;M to appropriate public sector&#13;
agencies (e.g., the local electricity company in the case of rural electrification subprojects)&#13;
to which it pays the relevant user fees.&#13;
5.   Implementation of subprojects therefore implies significant responsibility for the&#13;
community associations and the communities which they represent, and is a source of&#13;
empowerment for them. Charging the communities with the primary responsibility for the&#13;
implementation of their own subprojects assures better quality and reinforces their sense of&#13;
ownership. The supervision and administration of the subprojects is carried out by an&#13;
elected Supervision and Control Committee, which oversees the subproject from start to&#13;
finish and reports back to the association on progress. This Committee of 3 to 4 persons&#13;
is comprised of subproject beneficiaries, both members of the association and non-&#13;
members within the community. The members of the Committee are elected by the&#13;
beneficiaries-at-large and are recognized as having some experience or knowledge about&#13;
the proposed subproject type. The Committee visits the subproject regularly and monitors&#13;
subproject implementation, costs, procurement, and community contribution, as well as&#13;
any potential problems. The Supervision and Control Committee therefore acts as a&#13;
"community watchdog" to ensure that subproject funds and the community's contribution&#13;
are invested in accordance with the subproject agreement and that the investment is of a&#13;
high quality.&#13;
MUNICIPAL COUNCILS&#13;
6.    Under the proposed project, FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils may be&#13;
formed as legally-constituted civil organizations or may be established through Municipal&#13;
decree. In the latter case, the Council must nonetheless be granted administrative and&#13;
financial autonomy from the local municipal government. The size of the Municipal&#13;
Councils will vary across municipalities (usually between 10 and 15 members) and their&#13;
profile will be representative of the beneficiary communities. Of the Council's voting&#13;
power 80% is granted to representatives of community associations and of local civil&#13;
society, such as NGOs, labor unions and religious organizations. The remaining 20%&#13;
represent Municipal Government and other public institutions such as EMATER. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-83 -                          Annex D&#13;
PCU has a seat on the Council with the right to voice but not vote. Members of the&#13;
Council are elected for one-year terms (which can be renewed once) by a community&#13;
assembly.&#13;
7.    While the project Municipal Councils act independently of the Municipal&#13;
Government, the participation and support of the latter is nonetheless important.&#13;
Experience under the reformulated NRDP has demonstrated that the mayors and&#13;
municipal leadership welcome the project Municipal Councils as an instrument to meet&#13;
basic community needs to which their municipal budgets cannot realistically attend. The&#13;
participation of the mayor is fundamental in creating a synergy between the priorities of&#13;
the Council and the Municipal Government's investment program. In this sense, the&#13;
project Municipal Council is not seen as a parallel institution to Municipal Government but&#13;
as a counterpart.&#13;
8.    Municipal Councils are the key organization for the targeting of project benefits&#13;
and the allocation of resources under the proposed project. The Councils have a&#13;
fundamental role in mobilizing communities and fomenting community participation in&#13;
decision-making at the municipal level. By their nature as open, representative and&#13;
democratic bodies which build consensus on priorities, the Municipal Councils instill&#13;
transparency into the decision-making process for FUMAC and FUMAC-P investments.&#13;
The Councils receive, prioritize and approve subproject proposals from the beneficiary&#13;
associations. The monthly meetings of the Municipal Councils are widely publicized and&#13;
the public is encouraged to attend them. At these meetings, the beneficiary associations&#13;
present their subproject ideas to the Council. The Council deliberates and prioritizes the&#13;
subproject proposals based on its determination of the needs of the different communities,&#13;
and on criteria such as the level of poverty and the existing infrastructure of each&#13;
community in relation to the rest of the municipality; the type of subproject to be financed&#13;
and its potential to improve the life quality of the beneficiary population; and the&#13;
demonstrated participation of the beneficiary community in the identification of the&#13;
subproject and its commitment to the implementation and subsequent operation and&#13;
maintenance of the subproject. The Municipal Councils' prioritization process is the basis&#13;
of targeting in the project since the communities themselves through the Councils&#13;
determine where project resources will best be applied based on their first-hand&#13;
knowledge of local investment needs. The Council ranks the subprojects in priority order&#13;
based on the vote of the Council members. The subproject approval process is based on&#13;
technical and eligibility criteria. The Municipal Council screens the FUMAC/FUMAC-P&#13;
subprojects based on pre-established technical, environmental and cost/financial standards&#13;
(see Annex G) and either approves or rejects the proposals. Rejected subprojects are&#13;
returned to the beneficiary association with recommendations to improve the proposal.&#13;
Decisions for approval or rejection of subproject proposals are also determined by vote.&#13;
Under FUMAC, approved subprojects are sent by the Municipal Councils to the PCU in&#13;
order of priority for financing. In the case of FUMAC-P, the subprojects are financed&#13;
directly by the relevant Councils within an annual budget envelope as described below.&#13;
9.    A FUMAC-P Council bases its investment decisions on an Annual Operating Plan&#13;
(POA), developed with the assistance of the PCU at the start of every fiscal year. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-84 -                           Annex D&#13;
POA, which is voted on by Council members after detailed deliberations, establishes the&#13;
development priorities of the communities within a given municipality and the&#13;
corresponding investments to be financed with project resources. Each year, based on the&#13;
POA prepared, the PCU will transfer the allotted budget to the Council. The Council, in&#13;
turn, will transfer funds for subprojects approved to the beneficiary associations on the&#13;
basis of signed, legal agreements. This concept of approving subprojects within a budget&#13;
envelope enhances the Council's capacity to program and prioritize investments. If, on&#13;
the other hand, the Council's performance is unsatisfactory, it will run the risk of seeing its&#13;
budget envelope reduced the following year.&#13;
10.   Municipal Councils also supervise the implementation of subprojects in the&#13;
communities and work closely with the Community Control and Supervision Committee in&#13;
this respect. The Councils are well placed to provide this assistance. Given their&#13;
proximity to the communities and their lines of communication both with the PCU and&#13;
with the communitievthemselves, Municipal Councils are effective trouble-shooters for&#13;
subproject implementation problems.&#13;
PROJECT COORDINATING UNIT&#13;
11.   The PCU is the focal point for project administration and for communication with&#13;
the Bank and the State Government. It is also the project's principal liaison for the&#13;
Municipal Councils and for those community associations located in PAC municipalities.&#13;
In Maranhao, the PCU is the Nicleo Estadual de Programas Especiais (NEPE), as the&#13;
NRDP Technical Unit (TU) was renamed in a recent (April 1997) Governor's decree that&#13;
gave the TU increased autonomy and a revised structure, in line with the State's&#13;
decentralization strategy for the public sector. Under the proposed project, the PCU will&#13;
shed some of its executive responsibilities that it held under the reformulated NRDP and&#13;
increase its monitoring, technical assistance and supervision responsibilities. It will&#13;
promote decentralization and community participation in the project by delegating tasks to&#13;
Municipal Councils and participating state and non-governmental organizations.&#13;
12.   The PCU (NEPE) is an autonomous entity that is directly linked to the State&#13;
Secretary of Planning and is overseen by a Consultative Council, chaired by the Planning&#13;
Secretary and composed of representatives of the State Secretariats of Environment,&#13;
Science and Technology, and Agriculture as well as the State University of Maranhao,&#13;
with the Director of NEPE acting as Executive Secretary for the Council. The Director is&#13;
assisted by a Legal Advisory Group, a general Administrative and Financial Support&#13;
Department and a Physical and Financial Implementation Department, under which work&#13;
four closely interrelated Divisions, in charge, respectively, of subproject orientation and&#13;
selection; monitoring and evaluation; appraisal; and technical assistance and training.&#13;
Under the proposed project, NEPE will keep this structure although the Physical and&#13;
Financial Implementation Department will take on a more important planning function that&#13;
will be translated onto its name (see Organizational Chart at the end of this Annex). As&#13;
the PCU's staff is limited (36 technical and 22 administrative staff) and concentrated in&#13;
Sao Luis, all technical assistance, training and supervision tasks under the project will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                         Annex D&#13;
contracted to other service providers, i.e. NGOs, university and other private specialists,&#13;
as well as other public agencies like EMATER (see Annex E). In the field, the PCU will&#13;
link up with these service providers through 11 "regional agents" (Agentes Regionais da&#13;
Unidade Tecnica - ARUTs), also to be contracted. In keeping with the State's&#13;
administrative reform program, the ARUTs will use existing offices of EMATER or other&#13;
public agencies located in 11 strategically important regions in the state (see Annex C),&#13;
rather than new facilities that the PCU would have to establish and maintain.&#13;
13.   The PCU's principal tasks under the project will include: (a) project planning and&#13;
coordination at the state level through the preparation of POAs, including the&#13;
consolidation of POAs by FUMAC-P Councils, and monitoring activities through&#13;
maintenance of the project Management Information System (MIS); (b) promoting the&#13;
project and encouraging participation of potential beneficiary communities, NGOs and&#13;
private sector entities; (c) preparing project implementation reports and organizing&#13;
evaluation exercises; (d) ensuring timely and adequate provision of loan and state&#13;
counterpart funds; (e) appraising and approving all PAC subproject proposals; (f) entering&#13;
into subproject agreements with community associations (PAC) and Municipal Councils&#13;
(FUMAC) and into POA-based agreements with FUMAC-P Municipal Councils, to&#13;
transfer subproject funds and monitor their use; (g) overseeing all monitoring and&#13;
supervision activities under the project to gauge compliance with project guidelines and to&#13;
improve the quality of subprojects and project interventions, ensuring that environmental&#13;
guidelines for subproject approval and implementation are followed; (h) providing&#13;
technical assistance to the FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils; (i) preparing&#13;
statements of expenditure (SOEs) and applications for reimbursement; and () ensuring&#13;
that procurement, disbursement and auditing procedures applicable to the Bank loan are&#13;
followed. To increase the current Technical Unit's capacity to undertake some of these&#13;
tasks, particularly with respect to stimulating the mobilization and organization of&#13;
communities and providing technical assistance to them, training in specific areas will be&#13;
organized for its staff under the institutional development component of the project&#13;
(Annex E). In the area of environmental impact assessment, the PCU will be provided&#13;
training and assistance from specialized national or state agencies.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY&#13;
14.   The project, through the community subproject methodology, is expected to lay&#13;
the groundwork for, and consolidate, participatory institutions and processes at the&#13;
municipal and community levels. Formed into community associations, the rural&#13;
population is gaining a voice and a role in political participation which it did not have as&#13;
individuals. When communities organize themselves to receive benefits from the project,&#13;
and contribute to and operate and maintain the investments, the sense of ownership of the&#13;
investment empowers the communities and their organization and commitment are&#13;
rewarded. A municipality participates in the FUMAC (and eventually FUMAC-P)&#13;
program when this level of organization is apparent at the municipal level, and the official&#13;
municipal leadership supports participatory decision-making. The project Municipal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -                           Annex D&#13;
Council in FUMAC formalizes the communities' voice in the establishment of investment&#13;
priorities at the municipal level. FUMAC also forges a partnership between the&#13;
communities and municipal leadership as both groups contribute to the financing of&#13;
investments, thus leveraging project funds. As Municipal Councils gain experience and&#13;
capacity, progressing from FUMAC to FUMAC-P, they increase their bearing and&#13;
influence on public resource programming at the municipal level while reinforcing a&#13;
sustainable participatory process. Such an experience has been gained in a number of&#13;
highly organized municipalities in some of the northeast states under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP.&#13;
15.  Implementation capacity is central to the successful performance of the community&#13;
subprojects component and, hence, of the project's development objectives.&#13;
Implementation capacity constraints of the various institutions participating in the project&#13;
--beneficiary associations, Municipal Councils, public and non-governmental agencies, and&#13;
the PCU itself-- are specifically addressed by the project's institutional development&#13;
component. This component provides resources to finance appropriate technical&#13;
assistance and training in order that each group acquire the capabilities needed to&#13;
effectively perform its functions under the project (see Annex E for operational details).&#13;
16.   The institutional development component will give community associations access&#13;
to funds for community mobilization and organizational strengthening. Beneficiary&#13;
associations will also have access to expertise on subproject preparation and execution, as&#13;
well as training in operation and maintenance techniques to derive optimal benefit from&#13;
subproject investments. By providing training in financial administration, the project will&#13;
also prepare these groups to manage productive activities which open doors for future&#13;
income-generating endeavors. To fuliy develop their potential leadership role at the&#13;
municipal level and to fulfill their role within the project, Municipal Councils will require&#13;
assistance to orient their decision-making on resource allocation among community&#13;
investments and, in the FUMAC-P program, to develop their capacity for investment&#13;
planning and financial administration. Municipal Councils will also themselves serve as a&#13;
source of technical advice for community associations. The PCU, in its refined role as&#13;
project facilitator, will require training to master effective monitoring and supervision&#13;
techniques as well as enhanced project management and other skills. Where the PCU&#13;
contracts NGOs or other state agencies to assist in fulfilling some of its technical&#13;
assistance, monitoring and supervision tasks, these institutions may also receive specific&#13;
training under the project.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;
MARANHAO&#13;
E. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAINING AND&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY-BUILDING&#13;
1.    Technical assistance and training are fundamental inputs into the various stages of&#13;
the subproject cycle and overall project implementation. Evaluations of the reformulated&#13;
NRDP have emphasized the need for improved technical assistance and training to the&#13;
different partners in project execution -community associations, project Municipal&#13;
Councils and Project Coordinating Units (PCUs)-- in order to ensure higher quality&#13;
planning and implementation and greater sustainability of subprojects and to increase the&#13;
development impact of the project. Under the proposed Maranhao Rural Poverty&#13;
Alleviation project, technical assistance (TA) would be provided in two forms: (a) under&#13;
the Institutional Development component of the project; and (b) as a percentage of the&#13;
cost of community subprojects. Details on the operational aspects for the provision of TA&#13;
are included in the project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.    The Institutional Development Component. Funds under the project's&#13;
institutional development component would be used: (a) to mobilize and strengthen the&#13;
planning and implementation capacity of potential beneficiary associations and of FUMAC&#13;
and FUMAC-P Councils established under the project; and (b) to direct technical&#13;
assistance to the Maranhio PCU and State Planning Secretariat in specific areas, such as&#13;
specialized skills training and technical assistance for State reform. Since the component&#13;
is not tied to the subproject cycle, communities and Municipal Councils can receive&#13;
technical assistance independent of whether they have an approved subproject or approved&#13;
portfolio of subprojects, respectively. The resources of the Institutional Development&#13;
component would finance a variety of capacity-building programs, such as:&#13;
(a)   Mobilization assistance to beneficiary associations: the PCU (for PAC) and&#13;
Municipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUJMAC-P) would formulate and&#13;
fund strategies to extend mobilization assistance to those communities&#13;
lacking in organization and thus not initially in a position to benefit from&#13;
the project. Such assistance would include community workshops to&#13;
determine priority needs, training to community groups in organization&#13;
skills and helping them with the process of forming legal associations, etc.;&#13;
(b)   Introductory Municipal Council training program: the PCU would organize&#13;
this program to train, either directly or through collaborative arrangements&#13;
with other entities, FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils on the&#13;
project philosophy, subproject cycle and Operational Manual guidelines;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-89 -                           Annex E&#13;
and, more specifically for the FUMAC-P Councils, on the preparation of&#13;
annual operating plans (POAs), budgeting and administration;&#13;
(c)   Specialized skills training: the PCU, the project Councils, and groups of&#13;
comnunity associations, would receive, on a demand basis, practical "on-&#13;
the-job training" in areas such as monitoring techniques, environmental&#13;
impact assessments, financial administration, as well as specific technical&#13;
topics in support of subproject implementation and operation and&#13;
maintenance (e.g., for groups of community associations on water use);&#13;
(d)   Standard subproject design training: standardized subprojects (Annex G)&#13;
will reduce the need for intensive technical assistance in subproject&#13;
preparation for the majority of subproject types requested by communities.&#13;
The standard subproject models are especially helpful to communities&#13;
lacking experience in subproject preparation. Workshops organized with&#13;
community associations, community leaders and project Municipal&#13;
Councils would provide technical assistance in the application and use of&#13;
standard subproject designs;&#13;
(e)   "Best Practice" exchanges: the PCU and Municipal Councils would arrange&#13;
for technical exchanges among community associations with similar types&#13;
of subprojects. These exchanges have proven to be an effective way to&#13;
transfer know-how on subproject operation and maintenance from&#13;
community associations with successful subprojects to associations&#13;
initiating new subprojects. In addition, exchanges among Municipal&#13;
Councils within the state and among PCUs throughout the Northeast could&#13;
be financed to disseminate successful experiences across states; and&#13;
(f)   Technical assistance for State reform. Because the fiscal situation of the&#13;
State affects both project implementation and state counterpart funding,&#13;
technical assistance at the state level is needed to analyze issues&#13;
surrounding the reform of the State and to identify measures to improve&#13;
the State's capacity to overcome fiscal crisis and address its underlying&#13;
causes. The State Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN), through the PCU,&#13;
will have access to technical assistance funds for consultant services and&#13;
studies required for administrative and other state reforms.&#13;
3.    For access to funds from the Institutional Development component, the PCU and&#13;
each project Municipal Council Would prepare, as part of the Annual Operating Plan&#13;
(POA), a TA and training proposal indicating proposed beneficiaries (by type), numbers of&#13;
activities (e.g., events, consultants, etc.), expected subject matter and estimated costs.&#13;
The aggregate dollar amount of technical assistance included in each proposal would be&#13;
based on a series of parameters, such as the number of subprojects expected, the estimated&#13;
number of new Municipal Councils, the estimated number of communities needing&#13;
mobilization assistance or general technical support, etc. During the course of the year,&#13;
each actual TA and training event would require detailed terms of reference, outlining the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                          Annex E&#13;
objective and contents of each event. The PCU would provide the Municipal Councils&#13;
with a framework for the annual technical assistance and training proposals and with&#13;
model terms of reference to facilitate their access to the funds under the Institutional&#13;
Development component.&#13;
4.    Types of contracts under the Institutional Development component would range&#13;
from short-term contracts for single training events, to longer-term retainer contracts for a&#13;
series of training or technical assistance activities to be performed over a period of time.&#13;
For example, project Municipal Councils may contract the services of a local extension&#13;
agent to follow-up and provide TA to all community subprojects within the municipality.&#13;
Also, training in basic accounting and recordkeeping may be needed by a number of&#13;
community associations with productive subprojects and would best be handled by having&#13;
the PCU contract a specialized NGO to conduct in situ training with various community&#13;
associations over a certain period of time. The flexibility of contract types reflects the&#13;
diversity of TA and training needs of the various entities participating in the project.&#13;
However, to reduce the administrative task of processing a series of contracts and to take&#13;
advantage of economies of scale, technical assistance and training events would be&#13;
packaged whenever possible.&#13;
5.    The funds for institutional development at the project level will be administered by&#13;
the PCU, which will contract all technical assistance and training for the PAC program&#13;
and, in cases of packaging or upon request by the Municipal Councils, for the FUMAC&#13;
program. FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils may contract technical assistance&#13;
and training for themselves or, upon request, for beneficiary associations, with the&#13;
assistance of the PCU and on the basis of standard terms of reference. The PCU would&#13;
monitor the use of institutional development funds by the Municipal Councils and by&#13;
beneficiary associations through review of statements of expenditure (SOEs) and periodic&#13;
supervision.&#13;
6.    Percentage of subproject cost targeted to technical assistance. At the&#13;
discretion of community associations, subproject proposals may include, as part of the&#13;
subproject cost, an allocation for technical assistance in preparation and/or implementation&#13;
of the subproject. The percentage, to be determined by the Municipal Councils in the case&#13;
of FUMAC or FUMAC-P and by the PCU in the case of PAC, would vary from 2% to&#13;
8% of the subproject cost. It would depend on the technical complexity of the subproject,&#13;
on whether a standard design already exists for the type of subproject under consideration,&#13;
and on other factors.&#13;
7.    Technical assistance and training financed as a percentage of the subproject cost,&#13;
would need to be described in detail in the subproject proposal. For TA during subproject&#13;
preparation, the service provider would necessarily work in an "at-risk" situation, since&#13;
TA services provided would be paid only if the subproject is indeed approved and funded&#13;
under the project. However, to avoid the risk of hampering the provision --under this&#13;
mode-- of technical assistance for subproject preparation, community associations have&#13;
the option of requesting Municipal Councils to use resources from the institutional&#13;
development component instead to contract the required assistance. If the subproject is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-                             Annex E&#13;
approved, funds for technical assistance provided as a percentage of subproject cost&#13;
would be disbursed directly to the beneficiary association. The association would contract&#13;
the extensionist/entity under procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
described in the Operational Manual. For "turn-key"-type contracts, where the technical&#13;
assistance provider helps prepare and then implement the subproject, a smaller percentage&#13;
would be paid for the preparation assistance vis-a-vis the implementation assistance, in&#13;
order to direct the financial incentive toward the successful implementation of the&#13;
subproject.&#13;
8.    For greater effectiveness, technical assistance for subprojects should extend into&#13;
the post-implementation (i.e., operation and maintenance) period, particularly for&#13;
productive subprojects where success depends on the association's capacity to operate&#13;
and administer its small-scale, communal activity. Therefore, as a prerequisite for&#13;
approval of productive subprojects, community associations would have to provide a&#13;
satisfactory technical assistance plan with the service provider identified. In addition, as&#13;
part of their commitment to sufficiently operate and maintain their subprojects, beneficiary&#13;
associations should include technical assistance among the expenditures to be financed out&#13;
of the O&amp;M funds maintained by each association. The PCU and project Municipal&#13;
Councils would actively encourage this practice during routine monitoring and&#13;
supervision.&#13;
SERVICE PROVIDERS&#13;
9.    The identification and mobilization of technical assistance and training providers is&#13;
a crucial complement to the availability of resources. The most important providers of&#13;
technical assistance would continue to be the PCU and the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
Other service providers are readily identifiable from their participation in the reformulated&#13;
NRDP:&#13;
(a)   Multilateral and bilateral technical assistance agencies -- international&#13;
technical assistance organizations contracted by the PCU can provide&#13;
technical assistance to the PCU itself and to the Municipal Councils at the&#13;
project level;&#13;
(b)   EMATER extensionists -- in each municipality, local accredited agents of&#13;
the state rural extension agency (EMATER) would be identified by the&#13;
PCU, to be contracted by individual community associations for work on a&#13;
particular subproject, or by Municipal Councils, on a retainer contract, for&#13;
clearly-specified work with a group of communities. As a rule, the project&#13;
would channel resources (only for incremental operating costs, not salaries)&#13;
directly to local extensionists rather than to the central, state-level agency,&#13;
in order to stimulate greater local participation, reward effective agents and&#13;
penalize those that do not effectively provide the assistance needed; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -                          Annex E&#13;
(c)   Non-Govermnental Organizations -- staff from local grassroots&#13;
organizations can also serve as accredited agents, as described in the&#13;
paragraph above, or the NGOs themselves can enter into contracts with&#13;
associations, the Municipal Councils or the PCU for global or specific&#13;
technical assistance and training activities.&#13;
10.   The PCU and Municipal Councils would be charged with developing lists and&#13;
contacting all potential sources of technical assistance, such as: university students, local&#13;
private organizations, private extensionists, and state agencies. These lists would be&#13;
updated annually and would be available at the local level.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
11.   To create institutional incentives in the PCU to promote accountability for TA and&#13;
training activities, technical assistance would need to be a more visible and effective line&#13;
function within the PCU. A high-level Technical Assistance Coordinator, to be nominated&#13;
from among the staff of the PCU, would be responsible for overseeing the Institutional&#13;
Development component as well as the technical assistance arrangements forming part of&#13;
subproject funds (as described above). The main tasks of the Coordinator would be to:&#13;
(a) develop the technical assistance and training framework under the project; (b) identify&#13;
and contact potential technical assistance providers and maintain updated lists for each&#13;
municipality and for the project as a whole; (c) identify and prepare potential local&#13;
accredited agents; (d) prepare the annual TA and training proposal for the project; (e)&#13;
assist the Municipal Councils in the preparation of the annual TA and training proposals&#13;
and review the proposals presented by each Municipal Council; (f) develop model terms of&#13;
reference for specific technical assistance activities and training events; (g) encourage&#13;
replication of successful technical assistance and training activities wherever possible;; and,&#13;
(h) based on supervision findings, measure and report on the progress.of technical&#13;
assistance arrangements and their effectiveness.&#13;
12.   As part of their regular supervision efforts, the PCU and the Municipal Councils&#13;
would monitor the frequency and quality of technical assistance and training provided to&#13;
each subproject. SOEs presented by Municipal Councils and community associations for&#13;
technical assistance and training expenditures would be closely monitored by the PCU to&#13;
ensure that resources are used exclusively for that purpose and in a cost-effective manner.&#13;
As further incentive for their effective use, loan funds allocated to the Institutional&#13;
Development component will not be permitted to be re-allocated to finance community&#13;
subprojects or any other expenditure under the project. To give Municipal Councils&#13;
greater incentive to promote and achieve successful technical assistance arrangements in&#13;
their respective municipalities, the provision of technical assistance, both by the Councils&#13;
and other providers, would be considered a parameter by which to judge the overall&#13;
performance of project Municipal Councils and would factor into decision-making on the&#13;
promotion of FUMAC Councils to FUMAC-P. Technical assistance would also be&#13;
monitored through the project's monitoring and reporting arrangements (see Annex H).&#13;
Information from the MIS would identify active technical assistance contracts which will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                          Annex E&#13;
then be followed up during subproject supervision visits. The mid-year and annual project&#13;
progress reports, compiled by the PCU for the Bank, would contain specific sections&#13;
pertaining to the quantity, quality and effectiveness of technical assistance provided. The&#13;
project implementation review (Annex H) would also evaluate the quality and cost-&#13;
effectiveness of technical assistance and thus provide the beneficiaries' assessment of TA&#13;
arrangements. The Bank's Recife Office would evaluate the project's technical assistance&#13;
arrangements during regular supervision visits.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;
MARANHAO&#13;
F. THE FUMAC-P PILOT PROGRAM&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Decentralization of decision-making and the transfer of project implementation&#13;
responsibilities from the State to the local (municipal and community) levels, started under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP with the introduction of the community-based PAC and FUMAC&#13;
programs, will be further advanced in the proposed project. First, FUMAC coverage will&#13;
expand significantly under the project to cover over 110 municipalities by the fifth year of&#13;
implementation. Second, a further step towards decentralization will be taken through a&#13;
pilot program, FUMAC-P, which will promote the transfer of financial management&#13;
responsibilities to selected FUMAC Municipal Councils.&#13;
2.    Generally, municipalities which participated in FUMAC under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP tend to be those in which the environment for participatory decision-making is&#13;
more favorable, which distinguishes them from more traditionally-run municipalities with a&#13;
strong "clientelistic" approach. This environment has been the result of a conjunction of&#13;
cultural/political factors, such as the emergence of a movement for the development of&#13;
civil society (usually induced by religious organizations, NGOs and more recently by some&#13;
political parties) and the coming to power of a new generation of more open-minded&#13;
political leaders.&#13;
3.    Several important lessons have emerged from the FUMAC experience under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP. First, it proved to be an efficient, transparent approach for&#13;
identifying and prioritizing, through local-level consensus building, multiple demands for&#13;
investments by needy communities. Second, it provided the opportunity to experiment not&#13;
only with increased transfer of decision-making, including approval of subprojects, from&#13;
the state-level Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) to Municipal Councils representing&#13;
communities, but also with the management of community subproject funds by these very&#13;
Councils. This experience is reflected in the proposed project in the design of FUMAC&#13;
and, in particular, FUMAC-P, where the feasibility of financial management at the&#13;
grassroots level will be tested.&#13;
FUMAC-P: MAlN FEATURES&#13;
4.    The FUMAC-P pilot would account, initially, for about US$7.6 million or 7% of&#13;
the total base cost of the project over the five-year implementation period. In order to&#13;
motivate project Municipal Councils (both FUMAC and FUMAC-P) and have them&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-95 -                           Annex F&#13;
participate in the project in a sustainable manner, each Council --and its communities--&#13;
would benefit from a minimum of 5 subprojects per year. The initial amount allocated to&#13;
this subcomponent is therefore expected to allow the installation of some 20 FUMAC-P&#13;
Councils by the end of the project period. If this pilot approach proves successfiul with the&#13;
communities and meets its objectives of local-level investment selection, execution and&#13;
financial management, FUMAC-P would be expanded with funds initially earmarked for&#13;
the FUMAC and PAC subcomponents (see para. 10) and more FUMAC-P Councils than&#13;
initially foreseen could be set up during project implementation.&#13;
5.   Initially, the PCU would select FUMAC-P municipalities from among the best&#13;
FUMAC performers under the reformulated NRDP, i.e., those with the best record in&#13;
administering and executing community subprojects. Additionally, other municipalities&#13;
which have a favorable environment for participatory work (extensive community&#13;
organization, municipal officials open to participative decision-making, etc.), and are&#13;
interested and can commit themselves to following project guidelines, could be included.&#13;
There should also be some indication that local capacity exists to manage financial&#13;
resources, for instance in communities or existing associations already managing small-&#13;
scale businesses (on an individual or group basis) and whose members could potentially&#13;
form part of FUMAC-P Municipal Councils. As the proposed project gets underway, and&#13;
the FUMAC-P approach proves successful, other well-performing FUMAC municipalities&#13;
could gradually be upgraded into FUMAC-P municipalities.&#13;
6.    Once the municipalities are selected, allocation of funds would be done based on a&#13;
number of criteria to which different weights will be assigned. These criteria may include&#13;
several of the following:&#13;
(a)   ratio of rural to total population;&#13;
(b)   rate of indigence;&#13;
(c)   number and degree of dispersion of poor rural communities;&#13;
(d)   availability of public resources per capita;&#13;
(e)   number of subprojects approved under the reformulated NRDP (small&#13;
discriminatory factor);&#13;
(f)   perfornance in the previous year; and&#13;
(g)   willingness of the mayor (prefeito) to participate.&#13;
7.    FUMAC-P Municipal Councils would have the same composition and modes of&#13;
operation as FUMAC Municipal Councils (Annex D). They would be responsible for:&#13;
(a)   assisting rural communities in identifying priority needs and translating&#13;
them into investment proposals;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -                         Annex F&#13;
(b)   screening and reviewing these proposals, and ensuring that they meet&#13;
eligibility criteria as contained in the Project Operational Manual;&#13;
(c)   monitoring and supervising, together with the PCU, the implementation of&#13;
approved subprojects;&#13;
(d)   providing, directly or through contracting, technical assistance and training&#13;
to beneficiary associations in the design and operation and maintenance of&#13;
project-financed investments;&#13;
(e)   managing subproject funds and transferring funds to beneficiary&#13;
associations with approved subprojects; and&#13;
(f)   preparing indicative annual operating plans (POAs) for review and&#13;
approval by the PCU. The POA would contain a list of community&#13;
investment priorities, indicative targets to be met, a tentative timetable, the&#13;
indicative budget and the technical assistance required to implement the&#13;
proposed program. The PCU would review and approve the POA at the&#13;
end of the year preceding implementation.&#13;
8.    An agreement (convYnio) between the PCU and the Municipal Council would&#13;
establish the terms and conditions as well as rights and obligations of each party with&#13;
respect to the release and use of the approved funds. These (both loan and state&#13;
counterpart funds) would be deposited into an account in a commercial bank, and would&#13;
be withdrawn solely upon formal order by the Municipal Council. The Council would&#13;
screen community subproject proposals on the basis of the approved POA and the funds&#13;
made available by the PCU. An agreement (convenio) between the Municipal Council and&#13;
the beneficiary association would be required.&#13;
9.    Regular supervision of the operations of the FUMAC-P Municipal Councils would&#13;
be the responsibility of the PCU, focusing in particular on the administrative and financial&#13;
arrangements made by the Councils to effectively control and release project funds to the&#13;
community associations and on progress in the implementation of the POA agreed for&#13;
each FUMAC-P Council. Municipal Councils would be aided in their tasks, both for&#13;
management and accounting as well as subproject appraisal, monitoring and supervision,&#13;
by appropriate technical assistance under the guidance of the PCU. Unsatisfactory&#13;
performance of a Council would have to be carefully assessed by the PCU, including, if&#13;
necessary, the weighing of penalties. If unsatisfactory performance is not rapidly&#13;
corrected, it may lead to a reduction of the budget envelope allocated to the Council the&#13;
following year (para. 6) or, in the case of serious wrongdoing such as misappropriation or&#13;
misuse of funds, to legal remedies, combined with restructuring of the Council or its&#13;
downgrading from FUMAC-P back to FUMAC. On the other hand, built-in incentives&#13;
would encourage positive performance. Positive performance, for example, would be&#13;
rewarded with a potential expansion in the budget envelope allocated each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -                          Annex F&#13;
10.   The project implementation review to be carried out at mid-term would include a&#13;
specific evaluation of the FUMAC-P program. The basic purpose of this evaluation will&#13;
be to assess performance under the pilot program and, where necessary, adjust its design&#13;
and mechanisms in order to improve its procedures and impact on beneficiaries. If the&#13;
pilot program is found successful and its expansion is justified, part of the remaining PAC&#13;
and FUMAC funds under the project could be transferred to the FUMAC-P program for&#13;
implementation in the final project years.&#13;

G. STANDARD DESIGNS AND OPERATION AND&#13;
MAINTENANCE OF SUBPROJECTS&#13;
STANDARD DESIGNS&#13;
1.    Experience under the NRDP showed that the technical elaboration of subprojects&#13;
can be a difficult task for rural community associations. In some cases, especially where&#13;
competent technical assistance is not available locally, this resulted in inappropriate design,&#13;
cost overruns and subprojects left incomplete or unoperational. Under the proposed&#13;
project, preparation of subprojects by associations, as well as appraisal of the technical&#13;
proposals by Municipal Councils and/or the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), will be&#13;
facilitated with the adoption of standard designs developed by the PCU for the most&#13;
common types of subprojects found in Maranhao. The use of standard designs will ensure&#13;
that, at least for those subprojects most in demand by communities, project investments&#13;
follow recommended technical specifications, both for construction and operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M), meet reasonable cost parameters so as to be financially viable, and&#13;
comply with all necessary environmental requirements. At the same time, the risk of&#13;
"directing" community demend towards subprojects for which standard designs will be&#13;
made available would be reduced by the project's information campaign which advises&#13;
communities, inter alia, about the variety of subprojects that are eligible for financing.&#13;
2.    Different standard designs or appropriate standard documentation (projetos-&#13;
padrao orprojetos tipos) will be prepared for the various types of investments:&#13;
productive, infrastructure and social subprojects. The main items to be included in each of&#13;
the relevant documentation are indicated below.&#13;
3.    For productive subprojects:&#13;
(a)   a summary of the existing situation, including considerations on demand,&#13;
supply of raw materials, as well as markets;&#13;
(b)   a set of considerations and parameters to carry out simplified feasibility&#13;
studies, in particular: a presentation of subproject objectives and potential&#13;
benefits; the technical production process and type of equipment required;&#13;
technical parameters such as expected yields, coefficient of utilization,&#13;
range of output; range of costs of production, depreciation, maintenance&#13;
requirements; expected benefits and number of beneficiaries; indicative&#13;
internal rates of return, benefit/cost ratios, and other such indicators;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -                           Annex G&#13;
(c)   technical aspects, including a description of civil works, technical&#13;
specifications, bill of quantities, and the list of suppliers of equipment&#13;
required to operate the subproject;&#13;
(d)   guidelines for O&amp;M; and&#13;
(e)   environmental considerations and recommendations for specific measures&#13;
to mitigate the negative impact, if any, of the proposed subproject.&#13;
In addition, a set of operating rules (regulamento de uso) wifl accompany the&#13;
documentation for each of the proposed productive subprojects.&#13;
4.    For social subprojects:&#13;
(a)   a methodology for establishing the profile of social demand in order to&#13;
properly tailor the size of the required facility;&#13;
(b)   design considerations, e.g., services to be delivered by the proposed&#13;
subproject, and technical, legal and administrative aspects;&#13;
(c)   technical aspects as for productive subprojects;&#13;
(d)   O&amp;M features, including an evaluation of the delivery costs of the&#13;
proposed social service; and&#13;
(e)   environmental considerations where relevant.&#13;
5.    For infrastructure subprojects, whose size can vary widely depending on the local&#13;
context, intended number of beneficiaries and other factors, the concept of standard design&#13;
as such is not totally adequate. However, it is possible to develop:&#13;
(a)   generic terms of reference for engineering of different types of subprojects,&#13;
e.g., water supply systems, road rehabilitation, etc.; and&#13;
(b)   "typical" engineering (projetos tipicos) of small works such as pipes and&#13;
box culverts, retaining walls, typical decks for small bridges, etc.&#13;
6.    Standard designs will be available for those types of subprojects that most respond&#13;
to the needs and demand of communities. By project effectiveness, a first group of 10&#13;
standard designs will have been prepared by the PCU, and listed in the project Operational&#13;
Manual, for the following most popular types of subprojects: rural electrification, water&#13;
supply, local road improvements, small bridges, manioc mills, rice mills, clothes-making&#13;
units, tractors, artisanal fisheries and day care centers. While these standard designs&#13;
would be continuously reviewed and adjusted, others, depending on demand, would be&#13;
elaborated by the PCU for additional types of subprojects that would be requested by a&#13;
relatively large number of communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100-                           Annex G&#13;
7.    Careful field supervision and monitoring of standard subprojects by the PCU will&#13;
be necessary in order to: (a) avoid mistakes to be replicated on a large scale, and (b) fine-&#13;
tune and adjust the standard designs that have been developed. The need for the different&#13;
participating states to share experiences on standard designs of subprojects has also been&#13;
identified. In particular, those that have been prepared by the first six states participating&#13;
in the Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation Program (Bahia, Ceari and others) could be&#13;
shared by Maranhio. Workshops should be arranged in which standard subproject&#13;
documentation developed by the different states would be used for discussions to compare&#13;
and evaluate the different solutions that have been found to the same problem.&#13;
OPERATION AND MAINTNANCE&#13;
8.    Although the reformulated NRDP financed many of the same types of community&#13;
investments (e.g., manioc mills or small-scale rural water supply projects) that have been&#13;
supported under past programs or projects in the Northeast, one of its innovative features&#13;
was to ensure that these investments are operated and maintained by the beneficiaries&#13;
themselves, thereby enhancing their sense of ownership and the prospects for sustainability&#13;
of the investments. Under the proposed project, this feature will be maintained and&#13;
strengthened.&#13;
9.    Community associations will bear the primary responsibility for O&amp;M for most&#13;
project-funded investments, and this provision will be included in the agreements&#13;
(conmnios) with the associations. The relative responsibilities of the associations for&#13;
O&amp;M would vary according to the type of investment. As a general rule, beneficiaries&#13;
would be fully responsible for operating and maintaining their own productive subprojects&#13;
and some social subprojects, such as community or day care centers. In the case of most&#13;
infrastructure and other types of subprojects, the responsibility for O&amp;M would normally&#13;
be shared between the communities and the relevant State or municipal institution. In&#13;
exceptional cases of relatively complex subprojects, beneficiary associations might&#13;
contract private firms or NGOs to assist them in O&amp;M tasks.&#13;
10.   Based on experience under the reformnulated NRDP, several types of arrangements&#13;
would be implemented in order to ensure the financial sustainability of project investments,&#13;
as follows:&#13;
11.   Productive Subprojects (e.g., small-scale irrigation schemes, communal cereals&#13;
processing, manioc mills, etc.). Once a subproject has been approved for financing, the&#13;
beneficiary association elects a committee to be in charge of subproject implementation&#13;
and management. This committee has the task, among others, of determining the different&#13;
dues and user fees to be charged to association members (as well as to non-association&#13;
members using project facilities), based on estimated requirements for O&amp;M and capital&#13;
replacement or eventual expansion. User fees have to be approved by all association&#13;
members, and may be paid in cash, labor or kind, depending on the particular situation.&#13;
The committee is responsible for collecting the fees, placing them in a "reserve fund",&#13;
managing the reserve fund to meet extraordinary maintenance and capital replacement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-                            Annex G&#13;
requirements, and making payments for recurrent expenditures such as electricity&#13;
consumption, fuel, inputs, repairs, and employees' salaries.&#13;
12.   Social Subprojects (e.g., community centers, sanitation, health-related house&#13;
improvement, day care centers, school or health post rehabilitation). The degree of&#13;
community involvement in the O&amp;M of social subprojects depends on the type of&#13;
investment. In the case of subprojects related to public services, such as health posts or&#13;
schools, the municipality or relevant public/private entity could undertake O&amp;M foliowing&#13;
an agreement with the community. For other types of subprojects such as community&#13;
centers or house improvement, the community will be responsible for O&amp;M, each of the&#13;
community memrbers contributing either financially or in the form of labor.&#13;
13.   Infrastructure Subprojects (e.g., small bridges, water supply systems, fords,&#13;
road repairs). Different arrangements are to be followed for O&amp;M of infrastructure&#13;
subprojects. In the case of services (e.g., water supply) connected to individual&#13;
households, beneficiaries could transfer the corresponding assets to the relevant state or&#13;
municipal utility company, which then undertakes O&amp;M and recovers costs through user&#13;
fees. Simplified water supply systems (without connection to households) will be&#13;
operated and maintained by the community itself, which makes arrangements for collection&#13;
of dues or fees from individual community members to pay for O&amp;M expenses. These&#13;
arrangements are commonly found in the rural water supply subprojects financed under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP. For infrastructure subprojects such as rural roads, bridges, and&#13;
street paving, which serve a larger public, responsibility for O&amp;M would normally be&#13;
shared with the municipality under agreement with the beneficiary association.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;
MARANHAO&#13;
H. PROJECT MONITORING, REPORTING AND&#13;
EVALUATION&#13;
PROJECr MONITORING&#13;
1.    The establishment of an efficient project monitoring system will be instrumental in&#13;
following the progression of the investment program financed by the proposed Maranhao&#13;
Rural Poverty Alleviation Project and ascertaining its consistency with project objectives.&#13;
Project implementation relies heavily on a decentralized system of decision-making and&#13;
management, and is driven by demand from rural community associations which is filtered&#13;
through a selection process based on established criteria. This process involves a large&#13;
number of small, diverse subprojects over an extensive geographic area. Hence, since the&#13;
ex ante determination of the pattern of project investment and other key parameters is not&#13;
possible, effective supervision depends on the existence of a capable monitoring system.&#13;
2.    The objectives of the project monitoring system are to:&#13;
(a)   provide information regarding the progress of the project and the status of&#13;
the subproject cycle in its different stages (e.g., subproject approval,&#13;
procurement, implementation and disbursement); and&#13;
(b)   verify that project activities are consistent with the guidelines, targeting&#13;
methodology and selection criteria included in the Project Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
Project Database&#13;
3.    The project monitoring system would depend on a Management Information&#13;
System (MIS), created under the reformulated NRDP' and to be improved under the&#13;
project. The project MIS is a data base organized in three general levels: (a) a subproject&#13;
information module, which contains pertinent physical and financial information for each&#13;
subproject; (b) a financial management module, from which Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOEs) are generated; and (c) a project management module, from which all project&#13;
reports are generated. Under the proposed project, the MIS will operate as a network to&#13;
Under the reformulated NRDP, this system was referred to as the SSMP, or Simplified Project&#13;
Monitoring System.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -                         Annex H&#13;
facilitate the inputting of information and provide access to up-to-the-minute information&#13;
by all levels of project management, tailored to individual needs.&#13;
4.    For the State of Maranhio, the Project Coordinating Unit (PCIJ) would be&#13;
responsible for operating and maintaining the M1S and for providing the input&#13;
corresponding to PAC subprojects. The project Municipal Councils would be responsible&#13;
for completing the data sheets for FUMAC and FUMAC-P subprojects and, upon&#13;
completion of each data sheet, would present them to the PCU which would subsequently&#13;
update the MIS.&#13;
5.    The subproject module is the basic module into which all information collected&#13;
from the subprojects is entered and processed. Subproject information feeds into both the&#13;
financial management module and the project management module. Subprojects are&#13;
identified and entered in the MIS according to the following format. Information for the&#13;
MIS is obtained from data sheets for each subproject and separated into four submodules&#13;
which correspond to key steps of the subproject cycle:&#13;
(a)   Submodule No. 1 would include information for the subproject regarding&#13;
its location and identification, according to the following format: (i) by&#13;
program [PAC, FUMAC, and FUMAC-P]; (ii) by type [Infrastructure,&#13;
Productive and Social subprojects]; (iii) by category [e.g., water supply,&#13;
agro-processing, energy, etc.]; (iv) by sub-category, in particular for water&#13;
supply subprojects [e.g., dams, wells, tanks, etc.]; and (v) by location&#13;
[municipality, community and beneficiary association];&#13;
(b)   Submodule No. 2 would include the technical, social and financial&#13;
characteristics, as weli as a set of indicators such as cost/capita, cost/m2,&#13;
and other parameters to the subproject budget;&#13;
(c)   Submodule No. 3 would include information on subproject implementation,&#13;
including procurement procedures and contracting, all disbursement data,&#13;
including beneficiary and municipal government contributions to&#13;
counterpart funding, and provision of technical assistance and training to&#13;
the community association in question; and&#13;
(d)   Submodule No. 4 would include subproject completion information,&#13;
including beneficiary numbers and relevant subproject impacts (e.g.,&#13;
production figures, income generated, etc.).&#13;
6.    The information input into the MIS would come from standard data sheets of three&#13;
types: (a) subproject data sheet; (b) supervision data sheet; and (c) graduation data sheet.&#13;
The subproject data sheet, completed by the PCU (for PAC) and the Municipal Councils&#13;
(for FUMAC and FUMAC-P) would supply the basic information on the subproject&#13;
stemming from the subproject proposal. The supervision data sheet would verify and/or&#13;
update information on the subproject data sheet, identify any implementation problems and&#13;
possible mnitigating measures, and report relevant subproject impacts. The supervision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104-                           Annex H&#13;
data sheets would be completed by the PCU and Municipal Councils, or by those entities&#13;
subcontracted to provide supervision services, in which case the supervision data sheets&#13;
would be included in the TORs. Finally, the graduation data sheets would include&#13;
information on the community itself; including existing infrastructure and other indicators&#13;
of community well-being (see Annex C), to be filled out by the beneficiary community&#13;
associations as part of their subproject proposals, and verified and/or updated by the PCU,&#13;
Municipal Councils, or subcontracted participating agencies.&#13;
7.    Given the 3,392 subprojects estimated to be financed during the five years of&#13;
project implementation, the MIS is an essential tool for following the course of project&#13;
investment. Information from the MIS is also fundamental to measure compliance with,&#13;
and subsequent effectiveness of, the project's targeting mechanisms. By monitoring the&#13;
direction of project benefits and types of subprojects being financed, the PCU and the&#13;
Municipal Councils can direct appropriate technical assistance and training based on the&#13;
frequency of certain types of investment or target community mobilization activities.&#13;
Cases of mistargeting or misappropriation of funds -- resources channeled outside the&#13;
project area or for ineligible investments -- will be verified using the MIS in order for&#13;
appropriate remedies to be applied.&#13;
Monitoring Activities&#13;
8.    Within the framework of the project monitoring system, the PCU and the project&#13;
Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-P) are responsible for supervising the&#13;
application of the guidelines from the Operational Manual in the development and&#13;
implementation of all subprojects. Using the information from the MIS, combined with&#13;
field visits and inputs from project supervision reports, project-contracted studies and&#13;
audits, the PCU and the Municipal Councils would monitor project characteristics and&#13;
trends, identify implementation problems and accomplishments and undertake or promote&#13;
appropriate actions to improve project implementation (see Annex K on Project&#13;
Supervision). The MIS will also serve as a basis from which to derive Annual Operating&#13;
Plans (POAs), regulate their implementation, and make necessary adjustments to the&#13;
POAs and corresponding budgets during the course of each fiscal year. The delineation of&#13;
monitoring responsibilities between the PCU and the Municipal Councils would be clearly&#13;
reflected in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
PROJECr REPORTING&#13;
9.    The PCU is responsible for reporting on project progress to the Bank. Four types&#13;
of reports would be generated by the PCU and presented to the Bank:&#13;
(a)   a copy of the content of the MIS data base on diskette would be provided&#13;
on a monthly basis to the Bank's Field Office in Recife. The information&#13;
from the MIS will facilitate Bank supervision efforts and monitoring of the&#13;
investment program;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-105-                           Annex H&#13;
(b)   an MIS-generated report which would include the updated status of project&#13;
implementation (USPI) and an updated list of subprojects with their&#13;
physical, procurement and disbursement status would be provided to the&#13;
Bank's Field Office in Recife at the same time that the statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs) are sent to Bank Headquarters. The USPI and&#13;
subproject list will permit the Recife Office to review the eligibility of&#13;
subprojects presented for reimbursement;&#13;
(c)   a Mid-year Project Progress Report, using standard formats agreed with&#13;
the Bank, would be presented by July 31 of each year of project&#13;
implementation; and&#13;
(d)   an Annual Report would be presented by January 31 of each year of project&#13;
implementation. The Annual Report would use the standard formats from&#13;
the mid-year report but would also include a comprehensive review of: (i)&#13;
the status of the project performance indicators and the specific activities of&#13;
the institutional development component; (ii) subproject appraisal&#13;
indicators, the status of the targeting of project benefits, the application of&#13;
subproject investment eligibility criteria, and other implementation&#13;
guidelines included in the Operation Manual; and (iii) other relevant&#13;
analyses and recommendations from project-contracted studies and audits&#13;
which may be applied to improve project implementation.&#13;
PRoJEcT EVALUATION STUDIEs&#13;
10.   The project would develop and implement a range of evaluation studies to measure&#13;
the impact of the subproject investments and to provide appropriate feedback to improve&#13;
project methodology and implementation. The PCU would be responsible for drafting&#13;
Terms of Reference (TORs), which would form part of the Project Operational Manual,&#13;
and contracting local and other consulting services, both steps in agreement with the&#13;
Bank, for the following studies: (a) annual physical performance reviews; (b) a mid-term&#13;
implementation review; and (c) a comprehensive impact evaluation. These studies are&#13;
described below. In addition, the project would finance a study to determine the point of&#13;
community graduation and details on this study are included in Annex C. During the&#13;
course of project implementation, the PCU may also identify other needed evaluation&#13;
studies which can be financed under the project in agreement with the Bank.&#13;
Annual Physical Performance Reviews&#13;
11.   The objective of the Physical Performance Review (PPR) is to evaluate the success&#13;
of investments financed by the project, in terms of their achievement of specific subproject&#13;
objectives, and the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of the investments. For each&#13;
subproject included in the sample, the study would focus on the following points: (a) the&#13;
adequacy of the physical design in relation to the subproject's objective; (b) the quality and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106 -                          Annex H&#13;
cost of subproject execution; (c) the efficiency of procurement procedures used; and (e)&#13;
the targeting of project benefits. The PPR would provide indication of the effectiveness of&#13;
community-based procurement; compliance with and/or needed adjustments to cost&#13;
indicators and other physical/financial appraisal indicators and to the Standard Designs&#13;
included in the Operational Manual; and the quality of project investments and the profile&#13;
of distribution of project benefits. The PPR will also be an important input to the project's&#13;
implementation review and to project Annual Reports.&#13;
12.   The PPR will be conducted on the basis of TORs agreed with the Bank and&#13;
included in the Operational Manual. The first PPR will be conducted at the end of 1998&#13;
for a sample of subprojects representative of the prior year's investment program (PAC,&#13;
FUMAC, and FUMAC-P). To conduct the PPR, the PCU would: (a) establish, with&#13;
Bank agreement, the sample of subprojects to be reviewed; (b) supply counterparts to the&#13;
independent consultants contracted by the PCU to implement the study; (c) participate in&#13;
the diagnosis and generation of appropriate recommendations; and (d) incorporate the&#13;
recommendations into the implementation of the project. Subsequent PPRs would be&#13;
conducted each year and would review physical performance issues identified during the&#13;
first PPR and monitor improvements. TORs for the remaining PPRs would be agreed&#13;
with the Bank by no later than July 31 of each corresponding year.&#13;
13.  In addition, the first PPR will include a module to measure the quality and&#13;
efficiency of community procurement (direct contracting) of goods and works. Similar to&#13;
an audit, this module of the PPR would analyze the contracting procedures used and the&#13;
accompanying documentation for a sample of subprojects. The issues to be examined&#13;
would include: (a) the transparency of the contracting process; (b) if the goods/works&#13;
were procured at the lowest cost for the quality required and how these costs compare&#13;
with the unit cost references in the MIS; (c) in the case of technical assistance, if the&#13;
service providers contracted satisfied the profile and experience indicated in the TORs;&#13;
and (d) if the documentation maintained by the community association is sufficient to&#13;
complete Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) and to satisfy an audit.&#13;
Implementation Review&#13;
14.   Project performance would be measured through an implementation review at the&#13;
mid-term of project implementation. The purpose of the implementation review is to&#13;
assist the State Government of Maranhao, the PCU and the Bank, in the identification of&#13;
positive experiences and implementation problems and bottlenecks, particularly in&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P, in order to recommend needed modifications to their&#13;
methodology and design. Importantly, since the FUMAC-P program is a pilot, this mid-&#13;
term review would determine its feasibility and recommend its expansion.&#13;
15.   The mid-term review would be carried out through beneficiary consultations--&#13;
interviews and group discussions. These consultations would determine, inter alia: (a)&#13;
how the project is perceived and valued by the actual beneficiaries; (b) level of community&#13;
participation -- and any outside involvement (e.g., NGOs, EMATER, etc.) -- in the&#13;
different stages of the subproject cycle, including in the process of prioritizing local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107-                           Annex H&#13;
demands; (c) effectiveness of the subprojects in alleviating poverty and its consequences;&#13;
(d) the access to and quality of technical assistance for the preparation, implementation&#13;
and O&amp;M of subprojects; (e) the role of the Municipal Councils, how these Councils are&#13;
perceived in the communities, and how decisions on prioritization are effectively made; (f)&#13;
the role of Mayors in decision-making and in actual project implementation; (g) the&#13;
operation and maintenance of subprojects; and (h) how the role and performance of the&#13;
PCU is viewed in the communities (for PAC). Additional questions would evaluate the&#13;
efficiency and impact of the different subcomponents (PAC, FUMAC and FUMAC-P), the&#13;
effectiveness of institutional development activities, the level of community participation,&#13;
and the ability of the project to target and reach the poor. Overall, the beneficiary&#13;
consultations would generate a reliable evaluation of project performance and impact as&#13;
seen through the eyes of the ultimate beneficiaries which would serve as a convincing&#13;
input to improve project implementation.&#13;
16.   The implementation review would be carried out in the third year of project&#13;
implementation with a sample of community associations drawn from FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P municipalities, with a small residual sample drawn from PAC municipalities,&#13;
and a sample of Municipal Councils. The implementation review would be carried out by&#13;
independent consultants -- preferably a local organization with field experience -- under&#13;
TORs and contracting procedures agreed with the Bank. Inputs to the review process&#13;
would include: the mid-year and annual reports, MIS-generated analyses and reports,&#13;
results of the PPRs, recommendations from project audit reports, and additional reviews&#13;
or studies contracted by the PCU.&#13;
Project Impact Evaluation&#13;
17.   The project would also finance a baseline (year 1) and final (year 5) evaluation to&#13;
measure the socio-economic impact of the subproject investments. This comprehensive&#13;
evaluation, based on a random sample survey of representative subproject types, would&#13;
select important socio-economic indicators, such as employment, income, health,&#13;
education, and migration, and measure the impact of subproject investments on these&#13;
indicators and consequently the impact of the project on the quality of life of the&#13;
beneficiary population, differentiating by gender where possible. The evaluation would&#13;
also relate impact back to specific aspects of the project in order to identify those&#13;
conditions or activities which have resulted in positive impacts.&#13;
18.   The evaluation study would also measure the effects of the project on the financial&#13;
situation at the municipal and state levels, due to the positive impacts on project&#13;
beneficiaries (communities and families). For example, the financing of subprojects for&#13;
community water supply implies savings for municipal governments, and even State and&#13;
Federal Governments, in drought periods by preempting the need of these governments to&#13;
finance temporary water provision to rural communities through carro pipa, typically a&#13;
significant expenditure for municipal governments of the Northeast and one which is not&#13;
made to the extent needed due to limited resources. The project would also generate&#13;
benefits in terms of improved health or, in general terms, in improved quality of life for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108-                           Annex H&#13;
beneficiaries, which would result in savings for the State or municipal governments in&#13;
medical services, medicnes, etc., furnished to rural communities. In addition, the project&#13;
produces products over which the State and municipal governments can collect taxes&#13;
(such as the ICMS tax on marketed production). These products can include not only&#13;
products generated by productive subprojects but also consumer goods (e.g.,&#13;
refrigerators, radios, etc.) purchased by families benefiting from rural electrification&#13;
subprojects. Therefore, the study would evaluate the aggregate impact of the project at&#13;
the State and municipal levels, measurng: (a) the savings permitted by the project, in&#13;
terms of expenditures for water supplied by carro pipa' and provision of medical services,&#13;
etc., that no longer have to be made due to the project, and (b) the: taxes generated by&#13;
various types of subprojects financed.&#13;
19.   As in the mid-term implementation review, the study would concentrate on&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P municipalities, where the majority of project investments would&#13;
be located, and include a small sample of PAC municipalities, consistent with the project's&#13;
investment profile. The indicators would be identified and measured during the baseline&#13;
evaluation in the first year of project implementation, and assessed in the final evaluation&#13;
at the conclusion of implementation. The impact evaluation would be carried out by&#13;
independent consultants and contracted under TORs and procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
Implementation Plan and Project Performance Indicators&#13;
20.   The implementation plan and project performance indicators for each project&#13;
component over the five-year implementation period were agreed upon during appraisal.&#13;
Given the demand-driven nature and flexibility of the project, these indicators will be&#13;
mostly indicative targets. They can be expected to be achieved at least in the initial year of&#13;
the project, but may well develop somewhat differently in subsequent years, particularly in&#13;
terms of the proportion that each main category of subprojects (infrastructure, social or&#13;
productive) would represent out of the total investments financed by the project.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;
MARANHAO&#13;
J. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The project will assist the State Government of Maran}ao to alleviate poverty and&#13;
its consequences by providing basic infrastructure, employment and income-generating&#13;
opportunities for the rural poor, decentralizing resource allocation and decision-making to&#13;
local levels, leveraging resources mobilized at the community and municipal levels and&#13;
expanding social capital in rural areas of the state. These objectives will be attained&#13;
through three project components--Community Subprojects (90% of total base cost),&#13;
Institutional Development (7% of total base costs) and Project Administration,&#13;
Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (3% of total base costs).&#13;
2.    The demand-driven nature of the project implies that communities will determine&#13;
the nature and scope of each subproject funded. Accordingly, neither benefits nor costs&#13;
can be identified ex ante. As such, it is not possible to estimate an ex ante overall intemal&#13;
economic rate of return for the project nor individually for the variety of potential&#13;
subprojects. The proposed Rural Poverty Alleviation project is a foliow-up to the&#13;
reformulated NRDP (see performance and impact evaluation in Annex B). Subprojects&#13;
intended to be funded under the proposed project would, in general, be similar to those&#13;
subprojects funded and completed under the previous project. Therefore, the experience&#13;
and expost results of a sample of completed subprojects under the reformulated NRDP&#13;
can be examined, as internal rates of return and other economic parameters for subprojects&#13;
likely to be financed under the new project are not expected to differ greatly.&#13;
3.    Subprojects would be of many types, broadly classified as infrastructure (e.g.,&#13;
rural water supply, electrification, small roads and bridges), social (e.g., community&#13;
centers, sanitation) and productive (e.g., small-scale agro-processing and minor irrigation&#13;
schemes). Nmety percent of the total cost of the project (US$95.0 million) would support&#13;
matching grants for these subprojects. Bank funds will cover 75 percent of the total cost&#13;
of each subproject, with the remaining 25 percent consisting of counterpart funds from&#13;
state, municipal and community contributions. Of this 25 percent, approximately 10&#13;
percent is expected to come from the local community, either in cash or in-kind.&#13;
Subproject selection is demand-driven and based on community preferences. Subproject&#13;
proposals would observe standard documentation and technical, economic, environmental&#13;
and sustainability criteria established in a detailed Project Operational Manual, which sets&#13;
forth procedures and guidelines for implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-119-                             Annex J&#13;
Methodology and Assumptions&#13;
4.    In terms of the counterfactual, the project will support infrastructure and social&#13;
investments which, due to their public nature and the inappropriability of potential benefit&#13;
streams, are unlikely to be undertaken in sufficient quantity by the private sector.&#13;
Furthermore, while state, municipal and community counterpart contributions will total 25&#13;
percent of all subproject costs, it is doubtful that, in the absence of this project, the local&#13;
governments and communities would be financially capable of amassing the necessary&#13;
investment required to fund these projects, either due to poor rural financial intermediation&#13;
or low asset levels. Also, resource efficiency is improved through direct community&#13;
participation in the identification, selection and implementation of each subproject&#13;
proposal.&#13;
5.    While it is feasible to separate the three components of the project (i.e.,&#13;
Community Subprojects; Institutional Development; and Project Administration,&#13;
Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation), such a strategy would jeopardize the&#13;
achievement of project objectives. A project based solely on the provision of grants for&#13;
community subprojects would not address the need to simultaneously foster and bolster&#13;
the development of grass-roots institutions, such as the Municipal Councils created under&#13;
the project which review and approve the subproject proposals. While the overall level of&#13;
funding for institutional development is low (7 percent of total project costs), these funds&#13;
are vital to properly train and prepare these Councils for effective leadership in their&#13;
communities. Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation will&#13;
provide needed feedback on project performance and impact, as well as finance project&#13;
coordination.&#13;
6.    Complementarity among community subprojects makes a precise overall&#13;
quantitative analysis (i.e., economic IRR calculation) difficult. Simply put, the synergy&#13;
created from the interactive effects of several subprojects within any municipality is&#13;
difficult to capture and equally difficult to quantify. For example, rural electrification,&#13;
which accounted for about 20 percent of all subprojects funded under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP in Maranhao, generates a variety of productive undertakings, such as irrigation in&#13;
previously rain-fed only regions, opening opportunities for an expanded portfolio of crops&#13;
which the fanner can cultivate. Additionally, the electricity generated permits local milling&#13;
of basic grains, such as manioc, corn and rice, where previously these grains were&#13;
manually milled at home or processed outside the community at private mills. In short,&#13;
subprojects can build on each other, forging a network of community development&#13;
activities. Similarly, spillovers and spillins, in the form of incremental benefits or costs&#13;
which are unintended yet nonetheless result from the undertaking of the subproject, should&#13;
also be recognized in the economic analysis. Again, the spillovers are both difficult to&#13;
identify and difficult to quantify.&#13;
7.    Finally, the community subprojects foster the creation of social capital. The&#13;
demand-driven imperative of the subprojects requires that communities identify and&#13;
prioritize their most pressing needs. Municipal councils established under the project&#13;
would critically examine subproject proposals to both confirm their feasibility and verify&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-120-                            Annex J&#13;
their compatibility with overall community development objectives. These socially&#13;
sustainable community organizations are an important element of social capital formation.&#13;
Members of the community are responsible for counterpart financing of each subproject,&#13;
either financially or in-kind. As such, project resources are leveraged to undertake the&#13;
productive subprojects by which the community gains access to market channels.&#13;
Qualitative recognition of these benefits is vital to a fuili understanding of the economic&#13;
impact of a given subproject. However, as in the case of complementarities, spillovers and&#13;
spillins, social capital is difficult to quantify within the framework of estimation of internal&#13;
economic rates of return.&#13;
Infrastructure and Social Subprojects&#13;
8.    Infrastructure and social subprojects are analyzed using the least cost, best&#13;
alternative criteria. Several aspects of project design help to ensure that infrastructure and&#13;
social subprojects undertaken represent the least-cost, best alternative. First, the demand-&#13;
driven nature of each subproject permits scarce resources to flow where they are most&#13;
needed, thereby improving allocative efficiency. Community participation, under the&#13;
direction of the Municipal Councils created under the project, ensure that the chosen&#13;
subproject is the best alternative for the local community. Second, the use of standard&#13;
technical designs (projetospadroes), including cost parameters, for the most common&#13;
types of subprojects ensures that least cost models are adopted and decreases search and&#13;
information costs by providing communities with proven patterns of initiating and&#13;
completing a subproject. Third, the contracting procedures prescribed in the Project&#13;
Operational Manual requires competitive bidding on all subprojects; the community&#13;
solicits three bids for the subproject and subsequently chooses the least-cost bid. This&#13;
methodology has been shown to be more cost effective in completing the subproject than&#13;
were the same project undertaken by the public sector (for details and examples, see the&#13;
discussion presented in Annex B).&#13;
Productive Subprojects&#13;
9.    The financial and economic analyses completed for this project utilize expost data&#13;
on past subprojects completed under the reformulated NRDP. Productive subprojects&#13;
are analyzed by calculating the IRR for a sample of productive subprojects completed&#13;
under the previous NRDP. Actual cash flows associated with the productive subprojects&#13;
are captured in the estimation of the financial IRR. Nonfinancial benefits and costs, chief&#13;
among them incremental unskilled labor costs, are incorporated into the estimation of the&#13;
economic IRR The economic IRR is then refined by shadowing the impact of public&#13;
funds on the overall performance of the productive subproject. Data permitting, the cost&#13;
effectiveness of productive subprojects is indicated by estimating the subproject's benefit-&#13;
cost ratio and investment per job created.&#13;
10.   Generally, the analysis of sample cases indicates that the impact of the NRDP on&#13;
the quality of life and incomes of beneficiary communities has been very positive. As&#13;
shown in Annex B, productive subprojects comprised 31 percent of NRDP investments in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-121-                            Annex J&#13;
Maranhao and were typically implemented only after the basic infrastructure (electricity,&#13;
water supply, better feeder roads) became available. For this reason, many of the&#13;
surveyed productive subprojects only recently became operational, while others will reach&#13;
maturity over the next several years. Financial and economic analyses have been&#13;
conducted on three fully operational productive subprojects, representing some of the&#13;
most popular types of NRDP investments in Maranhao (see more detailed description in&#13;
Annex B):&#13;
(a)   Rice mills. Community rice mills typically consist of a shed and low-cost&#13;
milling equipment (less than US$10,000) operated by a wage-earning&#13;
employee. As in similar communal activities, association members pay a&#13;
monthly association fee and a user fee (conga) as a cost recovery measure.&#13;
Surplus rice remaining after family consumption is sold on local markets.&#13;
Based on the sample subprojects analyzed for this type of investment,&#13;
incremental net income generated would be about US$240 per family per&#13;
year.&#13;
(b)   Manioc flour mills. Casas defannha are a typical feature of rural areas in&#13;
the Northeast. The main benefits from this type of subproject are reduced&#13;
processing costs (plus, in some cases, savings in transport to other mills&#13;
located outside the community), leading to increased production both for&#13;
sale and family consumption. Where there is no other mill in the area,&#13;
community-owned casas defarinha replace home-based, artisanal (less&#13;
efficient) processing. Investments in the subprojects examined are&#13;
estimated to generate incremental net income of about US$200 per family&#13;
per year.&#13;
(c)   Tractors for Communal Use. Community-owned tractors with&#13;
implements are a popular type of productive subproject. Tractor use has&#13;
led to increased cultivation and greater crop diversification, productivity&#13;
and farm incomes. Tractors are labor-intensive when used primarily in pre-&#13;
harvest production activities and, when used for farm transport, can&#13;
substantially reduce producer costs. Increased net incomes of about&#13;
US$1,370 per family per year are resulting from the tractor subprojects&#13;
analyzed .&#13;
11.   Productive subprojects were evaluated using data collected by a late 1996&#13;
Bank/FAO mission and by the Technical Unit in Maranhao. Detailed cost and revenue&#13;
data were obtained on each productive subproject. Where either benefits or costs were&#13;
nonmonetary in nature, economic costs or benefits were assigned in order to calculate the&#13;
economic IRR. Conversion factors were also used to transform financial prices to&#13;
economic prices. The principal nonmonetary cost in the majority of productive&#13;
subprojects was unskilled labor; it was priced at the prevailing minimum wage and subject&#13;
to a conversion factor of 0.7 (See Table 1 for the conversion factors applied in the&#13;
analysis). Nonmonetary benefits flowing from the productive subproject (e.g., increased&#13;
manioc and rice production for family consumption) were valued at the market price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -                          Annex J&#13;
available for that good or service. No conversion factors were assigned to subproject&#13;
benefits, since in most cases small quantities were produced and they were traded locally.&#13;
Benefits, costs and prices are assumed to be constant over the 10-year project horizon.&#13;
Estimates of annual benefits, costs, and net incremental benefits were then obtained and&#13;
used to calculate both financial and economic IMRs. Given the sampling nature of the&#13;
exercise and the variations that exist among subprojects in terms both of costs and&#13;
performance, these results should be taken as illustrative only.&#13;

12.   Financial and economic analyses were conducted on a sample of productive&#13;
subprojects in Maranhao (see Annex B for descriptions of productive subprojects): (a)&#13;
manioc mills, (b) rice mills and (c) communal use of tractors. Collectively, these&#13;
productive subprojects accounted for about 12 percent of all community subprojects&#13;
implemented in Maranhlo under the reformulated NRDP. Table 2 gives the financial IRRs&#13;
for these productive subprojects. Financial IRRs for all productive subprojects evaluated&#13;
were satisfactory and in all cases greater than 50 percent. These uniformly favorable&#13;
financial IRs demonstrate the low-cost associated with both manioc mills and rice mills.&#13;
Furthermore, even though the tractor sujbproject requires nearly seven times as much&#13;
initial investment as manioc mills and rice mills, the corresponding revenues are more than&#13;
sufficient to justify the subproject.&#13;

13.  In the economic analysis, domestic prices were transformed to economic prices&#13;
(where conversion factors were available) and the financial analysis was extended to&#13;
include nonmonetary benefits and costs. Economic IRRs for the sample of productive&#13;
subprojects in Maranhao are reported in Table 3. Although lower than the financial IRRs,&#13;

the economic IRRs are nonetheless satisfactory. The primary factor in the difference&#13;
between the financial and econonic IRRs is unpaid labor required for each of the three&#13;
subprojects. These nonmonetaly labor costs, on average, were US$ 795 for manioc milis,&#13;
US$ 2,490 for rice mills and USS 17,668 for tractor subprojects, representing 36 percent,&#13;
62 percent and 48 percent of total annual costs, respectively.&#13;

14.   To determine the sensitivity of the economic IRRs to the distortionary effects of&#13;
publicly-funded grants and the costs associated with raising these funds (i.e., taxation), an&#13;
additional analysis was carried out using a shadow price of public funds. Although lower&#13;
than the "base" economic IRR estimates, the resulting "shadowed" economic IRRs remain&#13;
positive, ranging from 30 percent for manioc mills to 5 percent for tractor subprojects.&#13;
The capital-intensive nature of the tractor subproject (e.g., tractor purchase, implements)&#13;
was the primary factor in reducing its IRR under this scenario.&#13;

15.   Unexpected variations in benefit and cost streams can substantially effect the above&#13;
mentioned financial and economic IRUs. Sensitivity analysis attempts to capture these&#13;
unexpected variations. Table 5 reports the financial and economic IRRs under the&#13;
conditions of (a) a 10 percent decrease in benefits and (b) a 10 percent increase in costs.&#13;
The estimates obtained from the sensitivity analysis can be interpreted as a lower bound on&#13;
the financial and economic IRRs for each type of productive subproject examined.&#13;
Financial IRRs remain significantly positive, in all cases greater than 40 percent. Base&#13;
economic IRRs are again lower than the financial IRRs due to the impact of nonmonetary&#13;
labor costs; in the case of the tractor subprojects, the economic IRK is highly susceptible&#13;
to changes in the cost of capital equipment, e.g., tractor. With shadowing of public funds,&#13;
rice mills show a rather large decrease in the economic IRR to one percent, while the rates&#13;
for manioc mills and tractors are 18 percent and 13 percent, respectively.&#13;

16.   Cost effectiveness is examined by estimation of benefit-cost ratios for each&#13;
productive subproject and investment per job created (Table 6). These ratios are&#13;
calculated by deriving the NPV of both benefit and cost streams, assuming a discount rate&#13;
of 10 percent. The ratios reflect economic (i.e., monetary and nonmonetary) costs and&#13;
benefits. Benefit-cost ratios for productive subprojects in Maranhao range from 1.3&#13;
(tractors) to 1.8 (manioc mills).&#13;

17.   It is envisioned that those subprojects eventually undertaken will possess the&#13;
capacity for long-term sustainability through cost recovery. Whereas initial subproject&#13;
financing will provide the outlays required for start-up, subsequent net revenues from the&#13;
subproject should be sufficient to meet replacement costs of the original capital&#13;
investment. The sustainability of the productive subprojects was evaluated by examining&#13;
(a) cost recovery measures undertaken by each subproject and (b) the replacement period&#13;
for initial capital equipment. All three types of subprojects evaluated assess user fees to&#13;
cover 0 &amp; M expenses incurred and contribute toward the eventual replacement of capital&#13;
equipment. For all subprojects evaluated, cost recovery was sufficient. Table 7 details&#13;
cost recovery measures and replacement period for selected subprojects in Maranhao. In&#13;
spite of the relatively high up-front costs for the tractor subprojects, net revenues are&#13;
sufficient to cover replacement of capital investment within two years compared to an&#13;
economic useful life of ten years. Equally favorable is the sustainability of manioc mills&#13;
and rice mills, in which the replacement fund is built in only one-quarter of the project's&#13;
useful economic life.&#13;

Fiscal Impact&#13;
18.   The project will cost an average of US$16 million per year over the five year&#13;
project horizon. For FY 1996, the state of Maranhao realized capital expenditures of&#13;
US$ 232 million, an increase of 60 percent from FY 1995. As such, annual project costs&#13;
represent 6.9 percent of 1996 capital expenditures. The primary fiscal impact of the&#13;
project will derive from two sources: (a) cost savings and (b) revenue generation.&#13;
Experience has shown that local communities can undertake and complete these small-&#13;
scale subprojects at a lower total cost that is possible through the public sector. For&#13;
example, the rural electrification network installed by the NRDP in 1995 alone was&#13;
equivalent to that which was developed through other programs by the previous State&#13;
Government over a four year period. In another example, NRDP water supply&#13;
subprojects have minimized the need for water delivery via tanker trucks (carro pipa);&#13;
cost savings for all states under the reformulated NRDP due to these water subprojects&#13;
range from US$7 million in a year of normal precipitation to US$15 million in a drought&#13;
year. Surveys in many states indicate that infrastructure projects are, on average, about 30&#13;
percent less expensive when implemented by the communities (i.e., demand-driven) than&#13;
by government agencies or contractors. Thus, by decentralizing toward the community&#13;
level, the state can achieve costs reductions which in turn will allow reallocation of scarce&#13;
public finance to other pressing needs.&#13;
19.   The demand-driven nature of the project precludes the ex ante estimation of fiscal&#13;
revenues; however, experiences accumulated under the reformulated NRDP can shed light&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-126-                           Annex J&#13;
on any potential changes in public sector fiscal balances which may result from the project.&#13;
Expanded commodity production under the majority of the productive subprojects&#13;
evaluated can potentially generate additional public revenues through taxation. However,&#13;
the combination of informal market transactions, own consumption of subproject benefits&#13;
and tax exemptions will limit public revenue generation from these subprojects. The State&#13;
of Maranhao exempts the following agricultural items from value-added taxation (ICMS)&#13;
when marketed within the State: corn (for animal consumption), fish, agricultural inputs&#13;
and goat products. Interstate and state tax exemptions apply to the following items:&#13;
manioc, raw sugar, most fresh fruits and vegetables. This list would encompass the vast&#13;
majority of marketable produce from productive subprojects. In all cases, tax collection&#13;
depends on the extension of a nota fiscal which formalizes the sale before the public&#13;
authorities. However, rural transactions are largely informal in nature, which in turn&#13;
precludes significant public sector revenue generation from community subprojects.&#13;

K PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
1.    The principal role of project supervision is to ensure that project implementation&#13;
follows the guidelines set forth in the Loan Agreement and detailed in the Operational&#13;
Manual. At the operational level, project supervision arrangements are designed to&#13;
provide essential information on the general performance of the project and the feedback&#13;
necessary for managerial decision-making. Information collected regularly from the field&#13;
during project implementation will provide the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) with the&#13;
tools necessary to: (a) identify and correct departures from project guidelines; (b)&#13;
reinforce targeting mechanisms; (c) modify technical assistance strategies; and (d) identify&#13;
training needs.&#13;
2.    Supervision Responsibilities. In line with the decentralized implementation of&#13;
the project, the responsibilities for project supervision at the state and local levels will&#13;
correspond to the PCU and the project Municipal Councils, respectively:&#13;
(a)   at the state level: the PCU wili monitor global trends across all project&#13;
municipalities, oversee the functioning and activities of project Municipal&#13;
Councils, and supervise the portfolio of subprojects under the PAC&#13;
subprogram; and&#13;
(b)   at the local level: the project Municipal Councils will monitor the&#13;
performance of the subproject portfolio under the FUMAC and FUMAC-P&#13;
subprograms.&#13;
3.    At the state level, the PCU's responsibilities include: (a) monitor the quality of&#13;
global project implementation and administration; (b) assess community participation in&#13;
the identification, preparation and execution of PAC subprojects, as well as the quality of&#13;
technical assistance provided to beneficiary communities in PAC; (c) collect and verify&#13;
pertinent information on the project and subprojects for the MIS; and (d) review the&#13;
activities of the FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils.&#13;
4.    Supervision of the project Municipal Councils by the PCU will focus on the&#13;
following points: (a) the composition of the Councils to ensure they meet the required&#13;
80% beneficiary representation; (b) the frequency and openness of the Councils' meetings;&#13;
(c) the criteria applied to screen, prioritize and approve subproject proposals and the&#13;
effectiveness of targeting of project benefits to the poorest communities; and (d) the&#13;
capacity of the Councils to provide technical assistance to the beneficiary communities. In&#13;
addition to these points, supervision of the FUMAC-P Councils will focus on whether the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-128 -                          Annex K&#13;
administrative and financial arrangements made by these Councils are effective in&#13;
managing and releasing subproject funds to the community associations as well as&#13;
progress in the implementation of POAs agreed for each FUMAC-P Council.&#13;
5.    At the local level, the Municipal Councils, with support from the PCU, will carry&#13;
out the following supervision tasks in their respective municipalities: (a) verification of&#13;
the status and quality of subproject implementation; (b) assessment of community&#13;
participation in the identification, preparation and execution of subprojects; (c) evaluation&#13;
of the extent to which communities are organized to effectively undertake the operation&#13;
and maintenance of the investments, following, in the case of productive subprojects, the&#13;
appropriate regulamentos de uso; (d) identification of technical assistance and training&#13;
needs; and (e) assessment of effectiveness of targeting of project benefits and identification&#13;
of potential beneficiary communities not yet participating in the project. In addition to&#13;
these tasks, FUMAC-P Councils will follow up on compliance by beneficiary associations&#13;
with subproject agreements signed with them.&#13;
6.    To fulfill their supervision responsibilities, given the number of subprojects in the&#13;
field and the amount of information to collect, both the PCU and the project Municipal&#13;
Councils may delegate some supervision tasks to selected NGOs and participating public&#13;
agencies (e.g., EMATER), according to specific terms of reference developed for this&#13;
purpose. This assistance would be especially usefuil for evaluating the status of&#13;
community organization and mobilization. In addition, to facilitate the supervision of&#13;
individual subprojects under implementation, the PCU and the Municipal Councils would&#13;
liaise with the Subproject Supervision and Control Committees (Annex D) --community&#13;
members designated to supervise each subproject and control the status and quality of&#13;
subproject implementation. Whether carried out by the PCU, Municipal Councils or a&#13;
partner organization, subprojects would receive two supervision visits in their first year of&#13;
implementation and, in the case of productive subprojects and water supply subprojects, at&#13;
least one visit per year thereafter.&#13;
7.    Supervision Reporting. Information collected during supervision, including&#13;
indicators of subproject implementation performance and the identification of the principal&#13;
bottlenecks or problems, will be incorporated into the subproject standard data sheets (see&#13;
Annex H) and included in the MIS, maintained by the PCU. To aid the overall&#13;
information collection process between the state and local levels, the project Municipal&#13;
Councils will report regularly to the PCU on the implementation of the subprojects in their&#13;
respective municipalities. The contents and frequency of these reports would be&#13;
determined by the PCU and included in the Operational Manual. Based on the project and&#13;
subproject information collected at the state and local levels, the PCU will prepare and&#13;
submit to the Bank mid-year and annual reports on the overall physical and financial status&#13;
of project implementation and performance. In addition, the PCU will present the Annual&#13;
Operating Plan (POA) and corresponding budget for each subsequent fiscal year of&#13;
implementation to the Bank for its review and comment.&#13;
8.    World Bank Supervision. In keeping with the decentralized implementation of&#13;
the project, and based on the experience under the reformulated NRDP, the Bank will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-129-                           Annex K&#13;
continue its decentralized supervision of the project. The Bank will carry out at least two&#13;
regular supervision missions per year from its field office in Recife. Regular supervision&#13;
will entail: (a) a discussion of project implementation problems identified by the PCU&#13;
and/or Municipal Councils; (b) field visits to a random sample of community subprojects;&#13;
and (c) a review of the performance of all project components, and particularly an&#13;
assessment of the FUMAC-P pilot subprogram, to address problems and make appropriate&#13;
recommendations. In addition, based on frequent communication with the PCU, the&#13;
Recife Office will conduct short supervision missions to address problems which require&#13;
prompt action. Also, in view of the diversity of community subprojects, consultants of&#13;
different expertise would be contracted to provide occasional input and advice to Bank&#13;
missions. Two full supervision reports will be issued annually, as well as Back-to-Office&#13;
reports for each short supervision mission. It is estimated that about 35 staff-weeks will&#13;
be required for project supervision, or about 7 staff-weeks annually during the five years&#13;
of project implementation.&#13;
9.    The schedule of project supervision is as follows:&#13;
(a)   by July 31 and January 31 of each year, presentation of mid-year and&#13;
annual reports from PCU to the Bank;&#13;
(b)   by February and September of each year, full Bank supervision missions&#13;
completed; and&#13;
(c)   by October 30 of each year, presentation of the POA for the subsequent&#13;
year to the Bank for review and comment by November 15.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Rural Poverty Alleviation Project,
            based on the Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation Program,
            assists the state government of Maranhao in alleviating
            rural poverty by a) providing basic social and economic
            infrastructure, and employment and income-generating
            opportunities; b) decentralizing resource allocation and
            decisionmaking; c) leveraging resources mobilized at the
            community level; and d) deepening the creation of social
            capital. The project has three components: 1) community
            subprojects, which support small-scale investments selected
            and subsequently operated and maintained by beneficiaries;
            2) institutional development, which provides all
            implementing entities and communities with technical
            assistance and training to increase capacity and improve
            project implementation; and 3) project administration,
            supervision, monitoring, and evaluation, which finances
            project coordination and activities to provide feedback on
            project performance and impact.
