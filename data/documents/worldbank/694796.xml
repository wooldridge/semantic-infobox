I. ENTERPRISE SECTOR&#13;
A.    Sector Status&#13;
1.1    Moldova's industrial and agro-processing enterprises have been coping with a number of factors&#13;
inherited from the Soviet era: too many resources located in large loss-making enterprises, outdated&#13;
equipment with almost no process or product flexibility, loss of traditional inter-republic markets and&#13;
cooperation links, and perhaps most critically, inadequate management skills to cope with market-&#13;
induced changes. These structural challenges have been magnified by the implementation of a&#13;
stabilization program and rapid privatization. Early success with the stabilization program and mass&#13;
privatization was not complemented by adjustment at the enterprise level. By 1995, output had&#13;
decreased to 40% of its 1989 level. Contraction in industrial production appeared to have bottomed-out&#13;
in mid-1995 but following a slight recovery in early 1996, it continued to fall, reaching 8% for 1996.&#13;
With few exceptions, Moldovan enterprises have reacted to the new environment, with its hardening of&#13;
budget constraints, almost exclusively through passive strategies: the accumulation of arrears to the&#13;
budget, energy sector, wages and to the fragile commercial banks, as well as by increased recourse to&#13;
barter trade. Without inducing a more proactive stance of managers, a majority of privatized enterprises&#13;
would be forced into bankruptcy over the next few years. Moldova's First Private Sector Development&#13;
Project (PSD I), through its successful completion of radical restructuring in over 15 enterprises, has&#13;
demonstrated the benefits of non-investment, aggressive, cost-cutting and downsizing measures. These&#13;
enterprises, which are well down the road of recovery, are now demanding increasingly more&#13;
sophisticated forms of assistance. Such demand for Management Information Systems, Marketing and&#13;
Sales, Total Quality Management, ISO certification, as well as training of managers abroad, will only&#13;
increase as an additional 40 private enterprises are restructured in 1997.&#13;
1.2   Enterprise Sector Structure. Between 1992 and 1995, employment in the economy shrank by&#13;
18 percent (377 thousand people). This was mostly due to a sharp reduction of employment in industry&#13;
(more than 50 percent) while during the same period employment in agriculture increased by 3 percent.&#13;
In spite of reductions in employment in large enterprises--mostly in the former military complex--and&#13;
continuous labor reductions in the rest of the sector, large enterprises remain the dominant employers.&#13;
As in the other republics of the FSU, industrial enterprises are grossly oversized with a number of&#13;
employees listed on the employee rolls but without having been paid for months. The virtual non-&#13;
existence of a supportive network of industrial SMEs is a particularly acute problem for Moldova -- with&#13;
its small domestic market and traditional agricultural and agro-processing specialization. Over-sized&#13;
enterprises are still heavily dependent on cooperation with the producers and traders from the other&#13;
republics of the FSU. With the breakup of the USSR, and delay in re-establishing trade links with the&#13;
FSU, many production lines and markets were lost. In recent years, Moldovan enterprises have also&#13;
faced growing foreign competition in local markets. Participation of firms with foreign capital is low,&#13;
despite their dynamic growth in recent years in relative terms. Between 1992 and 1995, their volume of&#13;
production increased almost 50 times but by end 1995 they contributed only 3.3 percent of overall&#13;
industrial production and employed just 7566 people. This trend continued in 1996.&#13;

the role of the energy sector was&#13;
smaller (growth from 2.8 percent to 7.5 percent) but growth of the food industry was higher (from 40.6 to&#13;
56.5 percent) than measured by volumes of production.&#13;
1.4    Ownership structure began to change significantly in 1994 with the acceleration of mass&#13;
privatization. Moldova implemented one of the most rapid and broad-based mass privatization schemes in&#13;
the FSU. In addition, the Government has begun to offer some of the so-called "strategic" enterprises, such&#13;
as the national airline, through trade sales to strategic investors-preferably Western-while developing its&#13;
capacity for regulation and arms-length supervision. Despite these achievements, privatization of the&#13;
economy (privatization per se and emergence of a genuine private sector)--as measured by employment--is&#13;
not yet completed. In the industrial sector 18 percent of the employees still work for the state, in&#13;
agriculture 14 percent; in transport&#13;
more than 50 percent; in construction   o                  Eners&#13;

cases was again the state (due to tax    source: Moldovan Economic Trends&#13;
and energy arrears). Nonetheless, there a significant growth of new private firms, particularly in the first&#13;
nine months of 1996 (see Box 2). The private sector is expected to further increase with the new&#13;
Privatization Program, focussing on cash privatization, that was recently adopted.&#13;
1.5    Enterprise Sector Performance. Historical challenges related to the collapse of the Soviet&#13;
Union, the severe stabilization program, and deteriorating terms of trade have led to extraordinary&#13;
pressure to adjust quickly. Yet, significant adjustment at the enterprise level has only just started to&#13;
materialize. Few relationships have been forged with enterprises in non-FSU markets and the new&#13;
situation has not stimulated much development of local supportive industries (SMEs) to offset the loss of&#13;
traditional suppliers. Enterprises have yet to assume full responsibility for design, marketing,&#13;
purchasing, sales decisions, and the development of strong links with local suppliers. Macroeconomic&#13;
incentives introduced by the Government are not understood fully or are treated as temporary-all driven&#13;
by the unrealistic expectation that "relations from the past will be reestablished." Thus, the structure of&#13;
the enterprise sector, by firm size and product range, has not changed for the most part nor has the&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
behavior of much of enterprise management -- except for the firms and their respective managerial ranks&#13;
that were and are exposed to the lessons of PSD I.&#13;
1.6    The economy continued to shrink for   Box 3. Performance of the Industry Sector (I half 96/1 half 95)&#13;
four consecutive years until mid-1995 when&#13;
some improvement took place. The tendency    Sector        Sales   Costs of Produc- Employ-&#13;
has continued in the first half of 1996 (see                       Sales  tion    ment&#13;
Box 3) but has begun to show signs of&#13;
reversal during the second half of 1996. The    Industry Total    99.4  100.7  117.4  82.8&#13;

The ratio of earnings before interest and taxes   Furniture  112.3  114.3  121.8  88.3&#13;
to sales revenues decreased for industry as a    s     M&#13;

whole from 6 percent in the first half of 1995&#13;
to 5 percent in the first half of 1996, in machine industry from 9 percent to 7.6, in furniture production&#13;
from 8 percent to 6.2. Light industry reported growth of the ratio but at a very low level of 0.2 percent to&#13;
1 percent. These poor results--in most cases enterprises are not able to cover accrued interest and&#13;
overdue tax payments--are the consequence of too slow a reduction in costs per unit sold. Visibly,&#13;
downsizing has not had a significant impact on costs. Wages are low and a large part of employment was&#13;
only formal--employees have not been paid anyway. Sustainable improvement of the financial situation&#13;
of enterprises will require much deeper changes than a passive reduction of employment; deep cuts in&#13;
costs of energy and materials are also needed. In addition, growth of production has been faster than&#13;
growth of revenues from production sold. Improvement in this area will require fundamental changes in&#13;
marketing and finance -- cutting off clients who do not pay, searching for new clients and suppliers, and&#13;
selling off non-essential, unused assets.&#13;
1.7    From the perspective of medium term viability, Moldovan industrial enterprises, excluding newly&#13;
registered SMEs, can provisionally be divided into three groups, each with specific limitations and&#13;
restructuring needs:&#13;
*   Enterprises with salable products and local markets. This group is small, and includes&#13;
almost exclusively enterprises with an advantage in product characteristics over equivalent&#13;
imports, like basic foodstuffs, low priced furniture, services. Even this group is facing&#13;
growing competition from other Central and East European and Far East producers.&#13;
*  Large enterprises with obsolete products. These are enterprises which used to produce&#13;
electro-mechanical specialized and investment equipment, mainly for the military&#13;
complex and large state farms of the FSU. These were highly specialized units of an&#13;
integrated technological process dispersed all over the FSU and managed centrally from&#13;
Moscow. Recession and economic conversion in the FSU have made their products&#13;
obsolete. Their conversion as ongoing units will require a fundamental reorientation of&#13;
production and substantial long-term financing. Today in Moldova, neither is available.&#13;
*  Enterprises coping with one or more major constraints. Those dealing with a decline of&#13;
purchasing power domestically and in the FSU, the loss of foreign and domestic markets to&#13;
better quality products and/or poor managerial capacity to cope with the challenges. These&#13;
are the vast majority of enterprises and they are the primary target for both PSD projects.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.    Issues and Progress&#13;
1.8   The major issue affecting the transition of the manufacturing and agro-processing sectors to&#13;
market-based behavior is the insufficient adjustment at the enterprise level to a much more competitive&#13;
environment. Enterprise adjustment in Moldova has lagged behind other European transition economies&#13;
which had similar success with stabilization and privatization. The lack of enterprise level adjustment is&#13;
due to a complex set of infrastructural, institutional, and capability deficiencies.&#13;
1.9   Proximity of competitive market economies. Given a hard budget constraint environment&#13;
introduced by the stabilization program--control of the state budget deficit, price liberalization, falling&#13;
inflation, and strong currency--the major factors influencing the slow adjustment of Moldovan firms&#13;
have been the lack of commercial contacts with competitive markets, long exposure to the Soviet&#13;
economic system and very little autonomy enjoyed by managers under central planning. Moldova--a&#13;
land-locked country between Romania and Ukraine--has not benefited from contacts with contestable&#13;
markets. In the transition economies of Central Europe, such markets forced local producers to react in&#13;
order to compete and survive. Proximity to Western markets made it much easier for Central European&#13;
managers to travel and visit similar firms and to access start-up capital, know-how, and equipment&#13;
producers. At the same time, Western producers have been increasingly crossing the borders of Central&#13;
European transition economies and establishing 'twinning arrangements' of some form. All of the above&#13;
have facilitated the transfer of missing skills and assisted Central European firms, particularly SMEs, in&#13;
their continuous adjustment to market demands. Lack of bottom-level contacts and inadequate&#13;
managerial skills made the interpretation of, and acting upon, economic signals in Moldova&#13;
immeasurably more difficult than in Central Europe.&#13;
1.10    An inadequate accounting and auditing system. Delays in adjustment are also heavily related&#13;
to inadequate accounting and auditing standards and weak incentives to change them. Accounting,&#13;
financial reporting and auditing are still oriented outward to feed "the center" with window-dressed&#13;
historical data rather than inward, to support managers in their decision-making process. This lack of&#13;
motivation was clearly demonstrated during recent pilot liquidations under the SAL when the existing&#13;
accounting procedures presented a misleadingly positive enterprise picture and gave managers an argument&#13;
not to proceed with necessary downsizing measures. Subsequent experiences with restructuring under PSD&#13;
I showed that firms, using GOSPLAN accounting principles (accounting only for cost of goods sold),&#13;
reported profits but when International Accounting Standards (IAS) were applied, huge losses appeared. As&#13;
the number of enterprises that have undertaken heavy downsizing with the assistance of PSD I increases,&#13;
so does the bottom-up demand for introduction of IAS -- from managers who now need proper accounts for&#13;
their new management information systems (MIS). The process is accelerated by the availability of the&#13;
EBRD and PSD I lines of credit -- both of which require IAS from sub-borrowers and commercial banks.&#13;
This increased demand for IAS has allowed NGOs, the Government, as well as US AID supported&#13;
consultants, to intensify their efforts on broader implementation of these standards.&#13;
1.11    Scarce managerial skills. Managerial skills required to address the deficiencies and achieve&#13;
necessary restructuring are scarce and there is insufficient determination to manage the adjustment&#13;
process through radical changes in operations, methods, and structure. This includes a lack of skills to&#13;
prepare "bankable" projects for financing. Managers of already privatized enterprises that have not yet&#13;
passed through the PSD I supported restructuring program lack basic business skills. They remain driven&#13;
by volumes of production and see restructuring as contingent on: (1) the purchase of new equipment; (2)&#13;
the reintroduction of long-term subsidized financing; and (3) the renegotiation of preferential trade&#13;
agreements with FSU countries. Substantial managerial energy is spent on pressuring the Government to&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
secure the above-even after the firms are privatized-thus putting pressure on the Government to soften&#13;
hard budget constraints.&#13;
1.12    Narrow, yet high volume, product range. Enterprises aiming to shift to more competitive&#13;
markets encounter major technological problems. The organization of production has been such that&#13;
existing companies have little, if any, process or product flexibility. Most Moldovan industrial&#13;
enterprises perform poorly according to common performance benchmarks. The result is low working&#13;
capital productivity, high energy dependence, and very high material costs. Improved production&#13;
methods demand close consultation with the customer and good relationships with a range of&#13;
complementary enterprises. All too often, the lack of orders has contributed to the preservation of&#13;
production systems that lack the design, engineering, and organizational capabilities to succeed in a&#13;
market economy. Instead, the existing production system combines the low productivity of short runs&#13;
with the lack of flexibility of batch production systems. Product flexibility is very limited, due to a&#13;
severe lack of industrial design capacity. Consumer goods enterprises are facing a decline in sales due to&#13;
declining purchasing power in the FSU and increased competition from firrns outside the FSU. Local&#13;
markets occupy only a fraction of installed capacity and enterprises are excessively dependent on&#13;
imports. The Moldovan firms visited during preparation of PSD I and the current Project have been&#13;
trying to compete by lowering prices but are finding this difficult due to the need to allocate large often&#13;
fixed overheads across a low volume of output. Enterprises graduating from the PSD I creditor-led, out-&#13;
of-court, debt reconciliation program have in most cases: (1) radically reduced labor; (2) sold unused&#13;
equipment, old stocks of raw material and real estate to new entrepreneurs at auction; (3) rationalized&#13;
production, resulting in major savings in energy consumption; and (4) intensified their marketing and&#13;
sales efforts. Although even these enterprises lowered their costs of production significantly, it is&#13;
unlikely that with present quality and design, they could continue to increase the market share for a long&#13;
time without a fundamental shift in managerial performance.&#13;
1.13    Deficient and untested laws. Poor laws and administrative procedures required to restructure&#13;
enterprises are also an impediment to the efficient implementation of adjustment measures. Seven pilot&#13;
liquidations which were initiated under the SAL and restructurings undertaken under PSD I highlighted&#13;
deficiencies in existing regulations. A new Bankruptcy Law and Collateral Law were enacted in 1996 but&#13;
have not been tested in the courts. A Pilot Bankruptcy project has been initiated to help identify&#13;
potential bottleneck in the process and will recommend areas that require additional training or fine-&#13;
tuning. Once the first experience with restructuring is analyzed, there will be a need for a more&#13;
systematic review of the legal system governing commercial activities. Improvement of the courts'&#13;
capacity to deal with new and complex commercial issues is also critical.&#13;
1.14    Poor corporate governance. Excessively broad distribution of corporate ownership, created&#13;
by mass privatization, underdeveloped capital markets, and a lack of functioning shareholders' registrars,&#13;
is the main obstacle to efficient corporate governance executed by new private owners. In fact, the&#13;
inability to convene General Meetings of Shareholders which could then empower Boards to start heavy&#13;
restructuring (downsizing, break-ups, sale of assets) is the major constraint, at the moment, to an&#13;
increased number of entrants into the PSD I supported program. Collective investment vehicles-&#13;
investment funds, trust companies and citizens' associations (voucher clubs)-have introduced a new form&#13;
of collective, indirect ownership which facilitates corporate governance through the accumulation of&#13;
larger blocks of voting power. By late 1996, over 40 close-ended investment funds were in operation.&#13;
The funds and the banks are not yet important mechanisms enhancing corporate governance and&#13;
promoting restructuring of companies, although their role grows steadily. The financial sector faces a&#13;
number of immediate structural and regulatory issues that need to be clarified to be an efficient tool to&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
strengthen corporate governance. Protection of secured creditors, and rights of minority shareholders are&#13;
two examples of necessary changes. A regulated secondary market for trading shares was established&#13;
when the Moldovan Stock Exchange launched its first operations in July 1995 but little trading has taken&#13;
place and it has had a minimal influence on corporate governance to date.&#13;
1.15    The non-market relationship between government agencies and enterprises. There are&#13;
powerful short-term incentives for all the parties involved to soften budget constraints. For the&#13;
Government, most of the enterprises are seen as "too big to fail." For creditors, which are often distressed&#13;
enterprises themselves, there may be value in waiting. Suppliers are reluctant to provoke a closure of&#13;
major customers. A creditor's position may give it additional control over its debtor's behavior.&#13;
Enterprises which are individually not "too big to fail" tend to create a network of inter-enterprise&#13;
payments and therefore, disperse the potential costs of liquidation throughout a web of enterprises. For&#13;
banks, taking action against an undisciplined borrower may reveal the extent of its non-performing debts.&#13;
For all creditors, the cost of liquidation combined with the obligatory payments to the budget and&#13;
employees, may be higher than the liquidation value of the assets. As a result, even an improved&#13;
bankruptcy law and the growth of debts may not be enough to expand the use of bankruptcy proceedings&#13;
significantly. While relieance on court bankruptcy procedures will take on an increased role, acceleration&#13;
of liquidations, spin-offs and substantial downsizing-- as administered under the SAL and PSD I -- will&#13;
have a more powerful psychological demonstration effect for the immediate future. Experience has shown&#13;
that fast disposal of unused or underutilized assets has allowed a few major debtors to repay their debts to&#13;
their creditors (a former state bank) and thus help the bank itself to significantly improve its porfolio.&#13;
1.16    The above deficiencies all contribute to low competitiveness. The GOM's initial reluctance to&#13;
privatize SMEs immediately and support the entry of private SMEs (through spin-offs of larger SOEs as&#13;
well as the establishment of new SMEs) has only aggravated the current structural weaknesses and&#13;
insufficient competitiveness.&#13;
C.   The First Private Sector Development Project - Early Results&#13;
1.17    The proposed project will build on the groundwork laid by the PSD I Project. PSD I was&#13;
specifically designed to help managers interpret their initial exposure to market signals and start&#13;
responding to them rationally. Thus, in addition to increasing the pressure on enterprises to adjust and&#13;
providing positive incentives for those that do, the project focused on developing local skills in the&#13;
private sector necessary to make such adjustment sustainable.&#13;
1.18    PSD I has started this adjustment process in a selected number of enterprises when, after a&#13;
number of organizational, non-investment measures have already been applied, the utilization of assets and&#13;
human resources has improved dramatically. Incentives--both positive and negative--are built into the&#13;
process -- an out-of-court, informal, debt-moratorium and restructuring program. The objective was to&#13;
jump-start enterprise adjustment by offering the firms and their creditors a voluntary system, supported by&#13;
a private contract instead of public legislation, which would: (1) give the enterprises some breathing room&#13;
by restructuring current debt service payments, (2) give creditors, both public and private, some hope of&#13;
future recoveries by providing an analysis and recommendation as to downsizing and asset sales, designed&#13;
to create liquidity that could be used to retire debt and past due budgetary obligations (taxes, social fund,&#13;
etc.) and (3) give the owners some hope that, through restructuring, a viable core business could be defined&#13;
and saved as a profitable unit which could be expanded later on.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.19    A number of enterprises rushed into the program, expecting some form of traditional debt relief&#13;
or subsidy from the state. By October 1995, almost fifty enterprises had signed memoranda providing&#13;
them with a temporary freeze of past debts, while covering all the current obligations, and requiring&#13;
firms to prepare, agree with their creditors, and initiate implementation, of a restructuring plan. When&#13;
the first review in December 1995 showed that six of these enterprises managed to meet only about 80&#13;
percent of their current obligations, all six were eliminated from the program by the creditors committee.&#13;
This signal further energized the remaining firms--ten of which received TA during PSD I preparation&#13;
and SAL implementation--to be more active in reducing costs, collecting receivables, selling unused&#13;
assets and inventories, and searching for new markets. These ten firms are continuing their restructuring&#13;
by sending their managers on a pilot management training program to help us improve the design of the&#13;
Marshall Plan component of the Second Private Sector Development Project (PSD II, the Project) -- paid&#13;
by donor financing and the PSD I's technical assistance component.&#13;

long way to go. The program has helped a number of enterprises directly and indirectly. Firms have&#13;
streamlined their production methods, attained positive cash flows, and thereby increased their chances&#13;
for long-term survival. None the less, the number of enterprises that have benefited from the&#13;
restructuring program is still only a freaction of the total number of similar efforts have to continue and&#13;
expand so that the results can be better measured at the aggregate level.&#13;

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A.    Background, Objectives and Scope&#13;
2.1    The Second Private Sector Development Project (PSD II, the Project) continues to support a broad&#13;
program of reforms initiated by the Government of Moldova in the enterprise and financial sectors. The&#13;
project builds on already achieved results of PSD I in the enterprise sector and facilitates further&#13;
adjustment of Moldovan enterprises towards regional and international levels of competitiveness. The&#13;
Project would be supported by a proposed IDA Credit of US$ 9 million, funding from other donors,&#13;
including EU(TACIS) and Germany, totaling US$ 2 million, cost sharing by the participating enterprises&#13;
totaling US$ 3 million and the Government in-kind contribution.&#13;
2.2    Moldovan enterprises have to buy energy and raw materials at world prices and are facing&#13;
growing competition in their domestic and traditional markets. PSD I began to address these issues&#13;
through the transfer of restructuring skills and the provision of medium-term credit by participating banks.&#13;
The initial results have provided a good starting point for a number of restructured enterprises to maintain&#13;
and continue improving their competitiveness. These enterprises and many others currently embarking on&#13;
the restructuring path require additional and increasingly more sophisticated assistance. Enterprises&#13;
which have successfully gone through their initial restructuring must accept continued improvement&#13;
efforts as a normal mode of operation and address insufficient product or process flexibility, poor quality&#13;
and outmoded design as they try to shift to more competitive markets. Even Moldovan firms which focus&#13;
on local markets are confronting increased competition and will also have to start adapting fast in order to&#13;
survive. Thus, improving and retaining regional competitiveness will require switching to a philosophy of&#13;
continuous improvement by export-oriented firms.&#13;
2.3    The vast majority of Moldovan enterprises lack the organizational, engineering and design&#13;
capabilities required by international markets. Lack of market information and insufficient managerial&#13;
skills compound the problems and contribute to their diminishing market share and poor penetration of&#13;
new markets. Moldova will not be able to improve the position of private and privatized firms in isolation&#13;
from organizational approaches utilized by successful companies, including those in transition economies,&#13;
which compete on regional, EU, or global markets. To improve the current situation, Moldovan managers&#13;
need to establish close ties with their customers and with a range of complementary enterprises, domestic&#13;
and abroad. The Second Private Sector Development Project aims to develop the competitive advantage&#13;
of Moldovan managers of recently privatized and private enterprises in the industrial and agro-&#13;
processing sectors vis-a-vis their major competitors in the region.&#13;
2.4    The Project concept is founded on the experiences of countries which--lacking in abundant natural&#13;
resource or capital endowments--focused on the development of human resources to improve their&#13;
competitive position. The best-known examples are found in post-WWII Japan, Western Europe during&#13;
the Marshall Plan, and the new industrialized countries of East Asia. All demonstrated a high return to&#13;
their efforts to strengthen managerial capacity and overall human resources with dramatic increases in&#13;
productivity. Moldova is at a comparable stage -- without the income from extractive industries to&#13;
finance growth, Moldova must develop its human resources which are vital to its efforts to turn its&#13;
industrial and agricultural sectors into competitive engines of sustained economic growth.&#13;
2.5    The principal objective of the Project is to assist the Government in its efforts to increase the&#13;
managerial capacity of recently privatized enterprises and thus, improve their productivity and&#13;
competitiveness in domestic and international markets (see Diagram 1). This will be achieved by:&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(1) providing managers with competitiveness information about international and domestic benchmark&#13;
standards and marketing requirements and (2) investing in managerial skills through on-the-job training&#13;
for managers of private/privatized enterprises by way of secondments to leading industrial counterparts in&#13;
Central and Western Europe, East Asia and the United States.&#13;

2.6    The ability of Moldovan industrial and agro-processing firms to successfully compete&#13;
domestically and in the region (FSU and CEE) should become a national priority and be recognized as the&#13;
main potential advantage of the Moldovan economy. The Government already has a proven track record&#13;
of a full commitment to painful but successful reforms undertaken under PSD I. Significant financial&#13;
support for the Program will be one important element of the domestic commitment. To recognize the&#13;
efforts of participating managers, and acknowledge that they are the driving force for a "new Moldova",&#13;
the newly elected President is introducing annual Presidential awards for the Best Manager and Highest&#13;
Quality Improvement to further support this initiative.&#13;
B. Project Structure&#13;
2.7    To service implementation of the Program, a Competitiveness and Productivity Center (CPC, the&#13;
Center) will be created. The Center will be an independent, non-governmental and non-profit&#13;
organization. The proposed PSD II Project will support two activities: a competitiveness component,&#13;
Investing in Best Practice Information (IBPI), and a productivity component, Investing in Improvement of&#13;
Managerial Skills (IIMS), which are the two initial programs of the CPC. The first component of the&#13;
project, IBPI will invest in information by providing benchmarks on enterprise and sector performance as&#13;
well as identification of domestic and international opportunities. The second component, IIMS will&#13;
invest in human resources through provision of on-the-job training of managers abroad. IIMS will enable&#13;
at least 400 managers from about 200 private enterprises who have successfully completed pre-placement&#13;
training or can demonstrate comparative proficiency, to benefit from exposure to enterprises and&#13;
management behavior outside of the FSU for periods of up to six months. It is estimated that during the&#13;
life of the project, up to 2000 Moldovan managers will participate in pre-placement training--exposing&#13;
them to common business foreign languages (English, German, French, Italian), basic computer skills,&#13;
and management training. IIMS will also disseminate experiences brought from abroad to other managers&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and enterprises - indirect beneficiaries of the Program. In Moldova, this represents a significant&#13;
proportion of the total enterprise sector and management population. Within the Pilot, the first group of&#13;
managers that have successfully completed pre-placement training, will begin their foreign intemships in&#13;
Britain on April 1, 1997.&#13;

especially that ofrthe&#13;
leading East Asian economies (Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand )--demonstrates&#13;
that investment in measures enhancing competitiveness has a significant and long lasting impact on&#13;
economic growth (see Box 5). Over the last two decades, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand have rapidly&#13;
learned the principles of the "productivity revolution" following policies of the more advanced&#13;
economies of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. They have successfully implemented similar policies through a&#13;
spread of institutions disseminating and implementing better practices, resulting in increased productivity&#13;
and growth (see Box 6).&#13;
Box 6. Competitiveness and Productivity Centers in East Asia&#13;
In Fast Asia, the finctions of competitiveness centers have been distributed among a number of&#13;
institutions. l'he earliest institutions were the productivity centers focusing on business/production management&#13;
and entrepreneurial training. The most successful centers--found in Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan initially and&#13;
later in Malaysia and rhailand--were those that were demand driven. From the 1970's onwards, other institutes&#13;
were created that concentrated on standards and quality promotion, improving technical processes, promotion of&#13;
technology transfer and absorption. Separate market development centers to gather trade infornation and market&#13;
intelligence and to promote product packaging and design were also created in the 1970's and 1980's, e.g., China&#13;
External Trade Development Council and Malaysia's Export Promotion Organization. The functions of&#13;
competitive centers as seen in the US which deal with competitive strategies and benchmarking slowly crept into&#13;
the East Asian institutions in the early 1990's.&#13;
Based on the above, together with the ongoing success of ARIA, the envisaged CPC in Moldova should&#13;
be a sinall, independent, non-governmental, and non-profit organization operating on the principle of&#13;
connections and partnerships. These connections will assist in the acquisition and provision of specific&#13;
international best practice information--correcting for the information and knowledge failures endemic to&#13;
management in the country. The partnerships will leverage resources and facilities from other institutions and&#13;
donors in order to most effectively implement measures to overcome the skills gaps and thereby increase&#13;
enterprise competitiveness.&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.9    Process. In the first phase (year one) of its operations, the competitiveness program will acquire,&#13;
analyze, and disseminate information on competitiveness at the strategic and operational levels. At the&#13;
strategic level, it will acquire benchmarking informnation and will disseminate to policy makers and&#13;
enterprise managers the competitive position of selected Moldovan industrial and agro-processing sectors.&#13;
At the operational level, it will acquire and disseminate benchmarking information on productivity;&#13;
technological, organizational, and managerial capabilities of Moldovan enterprises relative to their main&#13;
competitors in Central Europe, Romania, and FSU as well as to best practices elsewhere--East Asia, EU.&#13;
In so doing, it will establish collaborative linkages with similar competitiveness centers in East Asia,&#13;
Europe, and the US, and have access to commercial databases. It will foster an environment for&#13;
productivity and quality education and improvement and instill a mind set for productivity and quality at&#13;
the national and enterprise levels. With ARIA, the restructuring agency created under PSD I, the CPC&#13;
will build close relationships with the best private, export-oriented enterprises including the best&#13;
enterprises which have graduated from restructuring and are able to take the next steps to improved&#13;
productivity and competitiveness. ARIA, through its restructuring and training programs, will generate&#13;
the initial demand for the CPC's services.&#13;

its dissemination work on benchmarking, marketing and related activities on continuous improvements in&#13;
productivity and quality. The Forum will help the Center establish a standard of excellence based on the&#13;
best firms to pull other firms along. It will also provide a platform for the dissemination of views of&#13;
visiting foreign experts, for the exchange of local experience to promote cross-learning between&#13;
Moldovan managers, and for the interchange of views on competitiveness between representatives of&#13;
management, government and labor. The CPC will also produce a Newsletter which summarizes&#13;
activities and proceedings of the Forum, and will produce a web-site that includes the cumulative editions&#13;
of the Newsletter and other public information. The CPC will have available for dissemination foreign&#13;
language translated materials (books, videos, and training materials) and will--following a public&#13;
education on quality and productivity--select nominees for the Presidential Awards to the Best Manager&#13;
and for Highest Quality Improvement of Firms.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
D. Investing In Improvement Of Managerial Skills Component (IIMS).&#13;
2.12     The IIMS component totals US $1 1.5 million and consists of US$10.8 million to finance&#13;
secondments of 400 managers and US$0.7 million to cover the costs of the Productivity Department of&#13;

emphasizes the reverse approach to that being practiced today: instead of only sending Western&#13;
consultants to Moldova, it will send large numbers of Moldovan managers to advanced producers in&#13;
developed countries or countries which have recently restructured their enterprises. The IIMS program&#13;
has its precedence in the very successful post-WWII Marshall Plan TA Component wherein West&#13;

as a basic management "tool kit". It is&#13;
expected that approximately 2000 participants will complete these introductory courses, from which&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
candidates will be selected for secondments to selected foreign firms in the same sub-sector to see how&#13;
skills, organization, and technology are combined to respond to continuously changing market demand.&#13;
Candidates will have to commit to a rigorous and demanding work program. To ensure transparency, the&#13;
final choice of secondment candidates will be made by a Selection Committee representing ARIA, CPC,&#13;
MOF, as well as the banking and enterprise sectors. They will be obliged by up-front contracts to "pay&#13;
back" this investment through their availability in their home country for follow-up dissemination&#13;
activities. To minimize costs and maximize the synergy effect, participants will be organized into groups.&#13;
The standard group will consist of three members visiting the same host firm. For training purposes two&#13;
to four groups can be combined. The secondment period will be divided into two modules: a 12-week&#13;
Basic Module and a 4- to 8-week Optional Module. A standard week work load will be as follows: (1)&#13;
four days in the host firm on-the-job training, (2) one day of in-class training based on case studies and&#13;
specific management courses, and (3) one day of report preparation. The second (Optional) module&#13;
would also consist of visits to other leading firms. Approximate costs are presented in Box 9 (page 21).&#13;
2.14    Dissemination. On their return, the groups will prepare, with the assistance of the CPC staff, a&#13;
thorough written report, including technological information on the operations of the visited firm,&#13;
performance studies, quality control, job structure and management, accounting and financing systems,&#13;
marketing channels and techniques, and export promotion. They will convene a series of workshops,&#13;
wide enough in scope to ensure that everyone with a stake in the industry was exposed to new know-how&#13;
acquired by the seconded participants. Managers returning to Moldova will also assist the CPC in&#13;
preparation of the next secondments and follow-up activities.&#13;
E. Economic Analysis and Rationale&#13;
2.15    The Project will assist governmental efforts to increase the managerial capacity of recently&#13;
privatized enterprises to improve their productivity and competitiveness, both domestic and international.&#13;
This will be achieved by: (1) providing managers with competitiveness information about international&#13;
and domestic benchmarking standards and marketing requirements and (2) investing in managerial skills&#13;
through on-the-job training for managers of private/privatized enterprises by way of secondments to&#13;
leading industrial counterparts in Central and Western Europe, East Asia and the US.&#13;
2.16    CAS Priorities. The project addresses two priorities: (1) hardening of the budget constraint in&#13;
the enterprise sector and (2) private sector development. To make both processes sustainable, positive&#13;
efforts are needed to promote the adjustment of Moldovan enterprises through technical assistance and&#13;
dissemination of best practices. SAL and PSD I aimed at accelerating the slow structural changes in the&#13;
enterprise sector -- while maintaining financial discipline and thus helping to underpin macroeconomic&#13;
stability. PSD I has demonstrated through a pilot that--given political will and readiness to confront large&#13;
layoffs--restructuring of enterprises emerging from the Soviet system is possible -- by breaking-up&#13;
enterprises and downsizing parts to their viable core. Previously unused assets, freed through this&#13;
process, are now being used by entrepreneurs. Under PSD I, the number of restructured enterprises will&#13;
be increased to about 50 over the next year with an additional 50 in the following year. However, for the&#13;
above process to have a significant impact on aggregate activity, a much larger number of former Soviet--&#13;
now privatized--enterprises has to be restructured and a much larger number of managers has to&#13;
understand and start interpreting the new "market signals" appropriately. Building on the lessons learned&#13;
from the SAL and PSD I, PSD II will enable about 400 managers from approximately 200 private&#13;
enterprises to benefit from exposure to enterprises and management behavior outside of FSU and&#13;
disseminate their experiences to other managers and enterprises - indirect beneficiaries of the Program. In&#13;
Moldova this represents a significant proportion of the total private enterprise sector (15%) and&#13;
management population (20%) who will benefit with direct participation in the Project.&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.17    The Project is coordinated with other providers of the TA: EU(TACIS) and GTZ. The Project is&#13;
pioneering this type of the TA in the Region, however, experience of successful countries of the Region&#13;
(Poland, Slovenia, Estonia, Czech Republic, and Hungary) strongly indicates that exposure to Western&#13;
management know-how and competition has a critical role in translating macroeconomic signals to&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
2.18    Adequacy of Policy Environment. Initially, a relatively mild contraction of output was&#13;
predicated for FSU countries. This was to be followed by a turnaround stemming from efficiency gains&#13;
expected to be released through liberalization and ownership reform. In other words, these macro and&#13;
structural reforms were expected to release significant gains -- where managers (and employees) in a&#13;
liberalized environment and with incentives from new owners are unconstrained and motivated to increase&#13;
efficiency. However, efficiency gains have been slow to materialize. Instead of an U-shaped recovery,&#13;
the output has followed an L-shaped pattern of "drop-and-stagnate." The vast majority of newly&#13;
privatized enterprises 'refused' to adjust and continued to wait for some kind of assistance from the&#13;
Government -- as taken together, they are 'too big to fail'. Early successes of the PSD I out-of-court led&#13;
restructuring program, convinced the policy makers in Moldova that restructuring, liquidation and&#13;
rationalization of employment may bring quick positive results. PSD II will further refocus the policy&#13;
from the short-term interventions--combination of discipline and support--toward a long-term and arms-&#13;
length policy of investment in access to commercial information, professional education, and improved&#13;
skills of managers and employees. In Moldova, as shown by the SAL and PSD I, the demonstration effect&#13;
provided by this Project will have a critical impact on institutional, legal, accounting and other reforms&#13;
and--more importantly--on their practical implementation.&#13;
2.19   Public/Private Justification. The Project will be funded from the IDA Credit for PSD II in the&#13;
amount of US$ 9 million equivalent; participating firms in the amount of US$ 3 million; and grants from&#13;
international and multinational donors in the amount of US$ 2 million, over the first five years of Project&#13;
implementation. Involvement of the Government as a co-financier of the project is justified by the&#13;
infrastructural character of the assistance, the need to continue the privatization effort after its mass&#13;
privatization phase, expected large externalities for other enterprises (dissemination) and for employment&#13;
and incomes in the economy as a whole. The proposed program resembles in its background and objectives&#13;
the TA component of the Marshall Plan implemented in 1950s. Under the Marshall Plan some 24, 000&#13;
managers from Western Europe visited the US to learn new methods of organization of production and new&#13;
management skills. The program was fully financed by the US Government. Reportedly, the productivity of&#13;
participating companies was increased from 25 to 50 percent due just to the improvement in organization and&#13;
management, without new investments. This successful model was later followed by Japan and East Asian&#13;
countries with similar results. In Moldova, one could expect even better results as Western European&#13;
enterprises suffered "only" war devastation and technological gap, with basic market skills and institutions&#13;
intact; while the Moldovan economy has to cope with the devastating consequences of the breakdown of the&#13;
Soviet system, including huge wastage of resources "programmed" into the system, lack of communication&#13;
with external suppliers, producers and consumers for more than fifty years, and a perverse incentive system&#13;
for managers and workers.&#13;
2.20   At the present stage of transition, understanding the vital necessity for continuous improvement&#13;
of firms and attainment of product competitiveness, both of which require investment in related skills, is&#13;
not yet internalized and demand-driven. A vast majority of Moldovan enterprises are cash-strapped and&#13;
do not see investment in the human (management) factor high on their priority list. There is also no&#13;
supply of similar services available in the private sector. An emerging local consultancy business is at the&#13;
stage of providing basic services - preparation of business plans for lending purposes, generic&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
management training. For the coming 3-5 years, a new type of institution: non-profit, non-governmental&#13;
(but government sponsored and financed) agency is believed to be the best catalyst of (and not a substitute&#13;
for) private sector providers of information and consulting services. Preparation of the managers for&#13;
foreign secondments (language training, basic computer skills and basic management) will be fully&#13;
contracted-out to local private parties.&#13;
2.21    Cost/Benefit Analysis. Preliminary cost-benefit analysis indicates significant net benefits from the&#13;
Project. Its total costs will depend on the number of participating managers and the duration of their&#13;
secondment. An initial sampling of 20 eligible enterprises suggests that some 200 enterprises would be&#13;
prepared to cover part of the costs of secondments for approximately 400 managers to participate in the&#13;
Program. The Program, realized over a five year period, would cost approximately US$ 11.5 million. The&#13;
cost of establishing and maintaining the Productivity Department (PD) of the CPC (responsible for domestic&#13;
pre-secondment training, managing the logistics of secondments, and dissemination) for four years would&#13;
be close to US$ 0.7 million. The remaining US$ 2.5 million, will be used in IBPI.&#13;
2.22    The benefits will be direct and indirect. Principal direct benefits are: (1) the increased value&#13;
added (profit and wages) per employee, mostly through cost cutting; (2) increased productivity (energy&#13;
efficiency, materials management, plant utilization, and product quality); and (3) increased level of&#13;
capacity utilization (through regaining of markets) in participating firms. The indirect benefit is the&#13;
externality of productivity improvement in firms which did not participate in the Program but received&#13;
detailed reports and participated in free-of-charge, follow-up dissemination of productivity improvement&#13;
measures 'copied' from abroad. Without the catalyst of improved management, many privatized firms&#13;
would slowly end up in bankruptcy. The Project provides the benefit of preserving and eventually&#13;
creating new jobs, thus reducing or eliminating related social costs.&#13;
2.23    An estimation of the increase in the value added which may be attributed to the proposed&#13;
secondments is complex and has been based on "proxy" indicators: (1) comparison of the present value&#13;
added per employee in Moldova with other Central and Eastern European economies in transition and in the&#13;
West, and identification of the "room for improvement"; (2) results from implementation of the PSD I.&#13;
2.24    An analysis of Moldovan light industry undertaken under PSD I shows that the value added&#13;
(wages and profits) per employee per year is between US$300 and US$400. For comparison, in Slovenia&#13;
in the same sub-sector it is US$10,000 and in the European Union the average value added is between&#13;
US$29,000 and US$39,000. The differences may be mostly attributed to the failures of the previous, and&#13;
still prevailing, economic system of management (low X-efficiency). The value added in the former East&#13;
Germany was about 27 percent of the West German level, and in the Czech Republic about 31 percent of&#13;
the Austrian level. It is clear that in Moldova there is room for dramatic improvement in the value added.&#13;
It can be increased easily by a factor of 2, but it will still not come close to the levels of Central European&#13;
transition economies.&#13;
2.25    Early results in ten out of 11 enterprises restructured under the PSD I Program include improved&#13;
production efficiency, significant cost reductions (through a range of measures including major&#13;
downsizing of excess labor, energy conservation, improved material management) and creation of a&#13;
number of new smaller firms through spin-offs with sustained ability to meet their current obligations. In&#13;
one case, due to the restructuring through liquidation, over 30 new private enterprises were established as&#13;
spin-offs of the old state enterprise. They doubled the turnover of the former firm and created over 300&#13;
new jobs which would have been lost. In another case, a reorganized company, streamlined its processes,&#13;
doubled its sales and now occupies 50 percent of its original plant--selling or leasing the rest to 25 new,&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
private companies. Energy costs today are less than 10% of what they were a year ago, while overall&#13;
production costs were lowered by 30 percent (see Box 4 on page 7).&#13;
2.26    These results are not unusual; in fact, they were achieved by a one-time intervention of local and&#13;
foreign consultants. World-wide experience confirms that there is a strong synergy effect when managers&#13;
are professionally qualified and motivated to change their enterprises continuously (by using consultants&#13;
and own expertise) on a day-to-day basis.&#13;
2.27   It is an important underlying requirement of the Program that the managers participating in the&#13;
secondments will: (1) prepare detailed reports of their findings during the secondment, and (2) "pay back"&#13;
by participation in dissemination of the results in workshops, seminars, visits and explanations to non-&#13;
participating enterprises. In Moldova, as PSD I experience shows, there is a very strong demonstration&#13;
effect. There are numerous examples of demonstrated interest regarding the results of enterprises&#13;
undergoing restructuring under PSD I from other, non-participating firms.&#13;
2.28    Sensitivity and Risk Analysis. The risk of project failure or low effectiveness is minimal if the&#13;
Project can be implemented according to the proposed guidelines and terms of reference. The potential&#13;
risk related to project implementation results from two extreme scenarios: (1) insufficient demand for the&#13;
TA provided by the Project, or (2) serious diversion from the approved criteria for participation.&#13;
Insufficient demand may result from the shortage of co-financing resources required from candidates&#13;
and/or inability to pass strict selection criteria (foreign language, computer literacy, basic knowledge of&#13;
managerial techniques). An initial group of eight managers has just completed a three-month training&#13;
course, while some 60 additional managers, each paying the full $2000 fee, have signed up for the next&#13;
several rounds of training. On the other end, selection criteria may be scaled-down to include lower&#13;
quality candidates. There is a potential risk that selected participants will not fully use the opportunities&#13;
available to them during the foreign secondment. All of these risks may be minimized by proper Project&#13;
set-up in Moldova and in visited countries. Project implementation will be based on formal agreements&#13;
with participating firms and with host countries (host firms and organizing counterparts).&#13;
2.29    Fiscal Impact/Cost Recovery. On the cost side, there will be no immediate fiscal impact, in the&#13;
long run it will be the repayment of the IDA Credit and service charge. On the benefit side, it is expected&#13;
that participating companies will increase their incomes shortly after participation in this Program and&#13;
therefore, make tax payments to the budget. (As noted in par. 2.20, in the period September 1995 - March&#13;
1996, the State and local budgets, the Social Fund and other creditors received US$103 million as&#13;
enterprises participating in PSD I started making their current payments.) The Social Fund will also save&#13;
on severance and unemployment benefit payments to employees who would lose their jobs if firms were&#13;
not restructured and went bankrupt.&#13;
2.30    Institutional Capacity. Moldova is only starting to build new institutional capacity supporting&#13;
emerging private businesses, following Western models. The largest asset in this effort is a genuine&#13;
understanding and enthusiasm at the highest level of the government for institution building. Experience&#13;
and achievements of PSD I supported Agency for Restructuring and Enterprise Assistance (ARIA) and the&#13;
Technical Unit are very encouraging. In just over a year, ARIA has become a center of excellence: over&#13;
70 local consultants have been trained in basic restructuring techniques, the first seventeen enterprises&#13;
have been restructured and results are regularly disseminated, thus increasing the demand and motivation&#13;
for restructuring in the enterprise sector. To service implementation of the Project, a Competitiveness and&#13;
Productivity Center (CPC, the Center) has been created. The Center will be an independent, non-&#13;
governmental and non-profit organization. The proposed PSD II Project will support a competitiveness&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
component, Investing in Best Practice Information, and a productivity component, Investing in&#13;
Improvement of Managerial Skills, which are the two initial programs of the CPC.&#13;
F. Detailed Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
2.31    The total project cost is US$14 million of which US$ 9.0 million equivalent will be financed by&#13;
an IDA Credit. The Investing in Best Practice Information (IBPI) component totals US$2.5 million of&#13;
which only US$0.7 million will be financed by the IBRD Credit, the remainder will be supported by EU&#13;
TACIS (US$1.8 million).&#13;
2.32   US$8.3 million from IBRD will assist the Government in supporting the Investing in Managerial&#13;
Skills (IIMS) component which supports the Productivity Department of the CPC as well as the Marshall&#13;
Plan for Moldova study tours (the Marshall Plan). Firms participating in the Marshall Plan segment of the&#13;
Project will contribute US$ 3 million to IIMS and GTZ will finance US$ 0.2 million thus bringing the total&#13;
project cost for IIMS to US$ 11.5 million. The majority of this amount, US$10.8 million, will be used to&#13;
invest in the development of managerial skills of local managers (400 managers at $23,000 - $28,000 each)&#13;
through a three pronged program. This program will consist of: (1) local training to bring the participating&#13;
managers up to minimum business practices standards (language, computer, management, etc.)--financed&#13;
entirely by the participating firm; (2) Secondment to foreign firms which will provide on-the-job training--&#13;
the majority of which will be financed by the Credit; and (3) dissemination of lessons learned from the&#13;
secondments so that firms/individuals who are unable to participate will be able to access the lessons&#13;
learned by their peers and also benefit. Dissemination will largely be financed by participating firms.&#13;
2.33   It is expected that no more than 2-3 individuals per firm will participate in the secondment&#13;
program to allow a greater number of firm's managers to be exposed to international practices. Based on a&#13;
demand survey completed during project preparation, eligible firms have agreed to provide up to $5000&#13;
per participant in the secondment program, which includes the approximately $2000 fee required for pre-&#13;
placement training. Total costs for the 90 day overseas on-the-job training, per person in a group of 3&#13;
people each, has been approximated at US$23,000 - $28,000 (transportation 500; per diem and hotel&#13;
8,100; foreign training institute 7,200; 5% overhead; and fees to the host company 6,000).&#13;
2.34    This technical assistance supports the efforts of the Bank, the Government and the international&#13;
donor community to implement the Government's reform program in the enterprise and financial sectors.&#13;
To date, the Donor community has been in full agreement with and wholeheartedly supports, the&#13;
objectives of PSD II and have generously provided resources to that effect. EU (TACIS) has agreed to&#13;
support IBPI in the amount of ECU 1.5 million and will consider additional allocations at the Project's&#13;
mid-term review. GTZ is supporting pilot secondments as part of project preparation activities and will&#13;
consider additional resources upon evaluation of the initial results.&#13;
2.35    Domestic financing (US$ 3 million equivalent) is envisaged from participating firms, on a cost-&#13;
sharing basis, for the Marshall Plan component of the project. The Government is also expected to support&#13;
PSD II by in-kind grants such as office space, office equipment, and telephone lines to the CPC. The main&#13;
merit of this source is that it demonstrates the Government's commitment to the proposed Program and its&#13;
objectives.&#13;

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.1    The Executing Agency for the Borrower (the Republic of Moldova) would be the MOP through&#13;
which the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is currently responsible for overseeing and coordinating the&#13;
implementation of PSD I. The PIU would continue to perform the same functions for PSD 1I. The PIU&#13;
would coordinate with the Competitiveness and Productivity Center which will be responsible for each of&#13;
the two Project components. Once the IDA Credit becomes effective, the PIU would be authorized to&#13;
request disbursements from the Credit Account and be in charge of opening and administering the&#13;
associated Special Account. The PIU, as part of the External Financing Department of the MOF would--in&#13;
addition to already existing staff--require budgeting for one additional professional staff who would be in&#13;
charge of day-to-day operations regarding PSD II. The appointment of this individual will be a condition&#13;
of effectiveness. The Director of the PIU, a senior member of the External Financing Department, already&#13;
managing PSD I on a part-time basis, would also be responsible for managing PSD II.&#13;
B. Investing in Best Practice Information&#13;
3.2   To manage and coordinate technical assistance required for both components--Investing in Best&#13;
Practice Information and Investing in Improvement of Managerial Skills--a Competitiveness and&#13;
Productivity Center has been established. The Competitiveness Department of the CPC will be responsible&#13;
for implementation of the IBPI component. Funding for IBPI, totaling US$2.5 million would be channeled&#13;
through the PIU to the CPC in the form of a non-reimbursable allocation from the Government. Efforts to&#13;
fund this component from foreign grants have already bome fruit. EU(TACIS) has already approved ECU&#13;
1.5 million (US$1.80 equivalent). Only US$0.7 million is expected from the IDA Credit to cover the&#13;
recurrent costs. A Funds Transfer Agreement (FTA) between the MOF and the CPC for the non-&#13;
reimbursable allocation from the Government will be signed. The guidelines for the FTA, financially&#13;
supporting the CPC's responsibility for both project components, were reviewed with the Moldovan&#13;
authorities during project preparation, and a satisfactory version of such an Agreement will be signed by&#13;
the responsible parties and delivered to the Association as a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
3.3    The CPC is a non-governmental, not-for-profit, independent legal entity, supervised by a&#13;
Supervisory Board, composed of two high-level government officials, two representatives of the donors&#13;
financially supporting the CPC, and one representative each from academia, business, and labor. The&#13;
Board will be responsible for the overall strategy of the Center, coordination with donors, and it will&#13;
monitor the use of resources committed by the Government and donors. The appointment of the&#13;
Supervisory Board and its President will be a condition of effectiveness. Staffing of the CPC, upon the&#13;
Association's "no objection" to the relevant TORs, will be the responsibility of its Executive Director.&#13;
3.4    The Center's programs will be implemented and administered by the Executive Director who will&#13;
be a full-time paid employee of the Center. The Excecutive Director of the CPC, satisfactory to the&#13;
Association, has been appointed. The Executive Director will report directly to the President of the&#13;
Supervisory Board and carry out all functions related to the Center. Recurent costs related to maintaining&#13;
the CPC on an on-going basis will be financed 100% from the Credit. Foreign experts will be hired as&#13;
consultants and be eligible for financing as consultant services using TACIS funds.&#13;

C. Investing in Improvement of Managerial Skills&#13;
3.5    The Productivity Department of the CPC will be responsible for implementation and dissemination&#13;
of experiences from the Investing in Improvement of Managerial Skills component. Funding for the IIMS&#13;
totaling US$ 8.3 million would also be channeled through to the CPC through the MoF in the form of a&#13;
grant from the Government. Participating enterprises are expected to provide US$3 million on a case-by-&#13;
case basis, while further efforts will be made to fund part of this component with foreign grants. US$8.3&#13;
million is expected to require financing from the IDA Credit. Financial arrangements would be finalized&#13;
between the MoF and CPC under a Funds Transfer Agreement (see par. 3.2 above).&#13;
3.6    The basic objective of the Productivity Department of the CPC is to manage the entire process of&#13;
seconding 400 managers from about 200 private or privatized Moldovan enterprises. This will enable the&#13;
maximum dissemination of experiences gained abroad to the widest number of local beneficiaries--&#13;
managers and enterprises that did not directly participate in the secondments. To secure optimal benefits&#13;
of the secondments, a special selection process will be developed covering basic foreign language&#13;
training, computer skills and introduction to management skills/training. Final selection of secondment&#13;
participants will be made by a Selection Committee (see para 2.13) to ensure transparency. To facilitate&#13;
start-up of these foreign placements, a pilot secondment program has been initiated during project&#13;
preparation. This pilot will train, test and select the first group of managers to participate -- under an&#13;
already approved GTZ grant. A specialized, independent training institution--the Multimedia Training&#13;
Center--has already been established and has begun operations with the first group of managers at full&#13;
cost recovery. Guidelines, regulating the mutual obligations between the enterprise/manager, and the&#13;
CPC as well as a sample Participation Agreement, regulating obligations between the CPC and seconded&#13;
managers are presented in Annex I.&#13;
3.7    Staffing. The productivity program, IIMS, will be locally managed by the CPC. There will be a&#13;
mix of experienced (retired) local and foreign managers, a group of young professionals, and support&#13;
staff -- whose primary task will be to monitor the quality of pre-placement training, ensure selection of&#13;
the best candidates, and organize dissemination. During project implementation, young professionals&#13;
may participate in the secondments as interpreters while at the same time, assimilating on their own as&#13;
additional participants. A person or organization in the host country will be designated as the&#13;
coordinator to be responsible for contacts with host firms and for the organization of host country&#13;
training activities (likely sub-contracted to a local productivity or specialized training organization). The&#13;
host firm will designate a guide to be responsible for day-to-day, on-the-job training and supervision of&#13;
the progress made with presentation of reports in selected host firms.&#13;
3.8    Targeted Participants and Eligibility Criteria. The targeted participants are medium-to-senior-&#13;
level managers of private/privatized companies from industrial and agro-processing sectors with a strong&#13;
motivation to learn. They will have basic competency of English or another commercial language, basic&#13;
computer skills and knowledge of management techniques (as defined in Block I or the successful&#13;
completion of Block I training). Eligible firms willing to designate managers for the Program have to be&#13;
private, without any overdue obligations to the state budget, or privatized firms in the process of&#13;
restructuring following the creditor-led restructuring program within the framework agreed under PSD I.&#13;
3.9    Cost Sharing. The participating firm would be expected to cover all the local costs during the&#13;
first and the last blocks of training (pre-placement training and dissemination of lessons learned), per&#13;
diem abroad, and transportation costs. A survey undertaken in October 1996 indicated that out of 20&#13;
firms, 16 were prepared to cover up to US$5000 per person. This is a significant effort for most of the&#13;
interviewed firms. On average, this sum is proportionally much greater than spending by Western firms&#13;
of comparative size on training activities. To secure participation of SMEs--which can economically&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
justified only very small expenditures on training--in exceptional cases and upon a decision of the&#13;
Supervisory Board of the Center, a larger part of secondment costs may be covered from PSD II&#13;
proceeds or grant financing.&#13;

3.11    A list of process and outcome performance indicators (Annex III ) has been discussed with and&#13;
agreed to, by the Government. These indicators, on the process side, include the creation and maintenance&#13;
of a database of international product benchmarks in the CPC, the identification of private/ privatized firms&#13;
committed to investing in their managers, and the number of host firms committed to participation in the&#13;
secondment program. The most important outcome indicators are: the number of benchmark comparison&#13;
reports requested by local firms, the number of firms with ISO certification, the participation of secondees&#13;
in dissemination efforts of lessons learned, and the financial self-sustainability of the CPC. The increase in&#13;
the profits of participating firms over five years (after subtracting the firm's cost sharing) should so&#13;
substantially exceed the grant funding to the participating firm that secondments might be continued for&#13;
other firms on a commercial basis at full cost recovery after the grant funding is finished.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
3.12    The project will finance the recurrent costs of the CPC--US$0.7 million for the Competitiveness&#13;
Department (IBPI component) and another US$0.7 million for the Productivity Department (IIMS&#13;
Component). The project will also include the IDA financed procurement of services in accordance with&#13;
the " Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" of January 1997.&#13;
3.13    Procurement process for placement of 400 managers into firms abroad. The borrower has&#13;
prepared a General Procurement Notice (GPN) and it has been published in the April 16, 1997 issue of&#13;
United Nations Development Business (UNDB). After a period of sixty days, the borrower will advertise&#13;
to identify firms interested in organization of secondments of Moldovan managers in foreign firms. The&#13;
borrower--thirty days--after advertising in a national newspaper and in UNDB -- will shortlist up to six&#13;
companies and invite them to prepare proposals. The invitation will include the TOR, prepared by the&#13;
Borrower, outlining the specific nature of this project: (1) the training will include in-company (80 percent)&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
as well as classroom (20 percent) placements during 3-6 month secondments and-- (2) regional preference&#13;
(at least 60 percent of placings should be in Central and Eastern European transitional economies). The&#13;
TOR, Letter of Invitation (LOI), Request for Proposal (RFP) and Information to Consultants will be&#13;
submitted to the Association by May 31, 1997.&#13;
3.14     The borrower will select--through a Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) process the&#13;
short list of firms to manage the training process. Only the financial proposal of the firms scoring 75&#13;
points or more in the technical evaluation will be opened and up to three of the top ranked firms will be&#13;
hired to manage the training program. The financial proposal will be based on a lump sum for the&#13;
training of 50 managers in one year. The details of the assignment (i.e. 4 month foreign placements, 50%&#13;
in EU countries, 50% in CEE countries) shall be clearly stated in the LOI and TOR.&#13;

3.15    Each of the qualifying firms will be hired to organize placement and training for a group of&#13;
Moldovan managers not exceeding 150 over a five year period. The project will be divided into three&#13;
Phases (not more than 50 managers will be trained in each Phase). Following each Phase, the Borrower&#13;
and the firms will evaluate results and decide whether to proceed with the next phase/batch. The LOI and&#13;
TOR will describe the guidelines establishing the basis for the allocation of the trainees under each of the&#13;
contracts in a fair and efficient manner (by sector, remaining capacity, geographical spread, etc.) as well&#13;
as the selection criteria and basic qualification requirements of the trainees. The LOI would indicate that&#13;
contracts may be subject to extension under same terms and conditions for the following years with the&#13;
prior approval by the Association.&#13;
3.16    Procurement review: For IIMS component, prior Association review will be required for the: (i)&#13;
GPN and Specific Procurement Notice; (ii) TOR; (iii) the short list of firms; (iv) the evaluation reports&#13;
(technical and combined proposals); and (v) the contract. The Association will also review and approve ex-&#13;
ante: (i) the contracts of the selected firms and (ii) the evaluation report of each completed phase and&#13;
decision to continue/discontinue with the next phase (managerial group). Prior review will also be required&#13;
for the CPC's annual budget and any sole-source consultant contracts.&#13;

E. Disbursements&#13;
3.17    To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower will establish a Special Account in one of the&#13;
major foreign commercial banks with terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association to cover the&#13;
Association's share of expenditures. The Authorized Allocation to the Special Account will be US$&#13;
600,000. During the early stage of the Project, the initial allocation to the Special Account will be&#13;
limited to US$ 300,000. When the aggregate disbursements have reached the level of US$ 1,000,000, the&#13;
initial allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of US$ 600,000 by submitting the&#13;
relevant Application for withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the Special Accounts will be&#13;
submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs first.&#13;
Documentation requirements for replenishment will follow standard Association procedures as described&#13;
in the Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the Special Account, which have&#13;
been reconciled by the Borrower, will accompany all replenishment requests. The minimum size of&#13;
application for payment directly from the account will amount to 20% of the authorized allocation to the&#13;
Special Account.&#13;
3.18    Disbursements will be made against Statements of Expenditures for contracts below&#13;
US$100,000 for consultant firms and below US$50,000 for individual consultants. All disbursements&#13;
above a threshold of US$ 100,000 for firms and above US$50,000 for individual consultants will be made&#13;
against fully documented withdrawal applications. The prior review for SOEs will be the same as for the&#13;
procurement prior review (see Procurement Infonnation table on page 23).&#13;
3.19    The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2001. The proposed closing date is&#13;
June 30, 2002.&#13;
F. Project Accounting, Financial Reporting, Auditing and Supervision&#13;
3.20   Accounting. The Borrower will have responsibility for the appropriate accounting of the funds&#13;
provided under the Credit, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring that audits of the&#13;
financial statements or reports are submitted to the Association. The PIU, on behalf of the Borrower,&#13;
will establish an appropriate accounting system to provide information on the proper receipt and use of&#13;
funds in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The system should ensure timely and accurate&#13;
accounting of all transactions under the Credit and clear presentation of the financial information.&#13;
3.21    Financial Reporting. Financial reporting for the Project components will be carried out by the&#13;
PIU closely reflecting the specific requirements of the Credit. It will consist of a statement of receipts&#13;
and payments for the reporting period since the beginning of the Project. The reporting will be in&#13;
accordance with disbursements classified and reported by the expenditure categories agreed to with the&#13;
Borrower and spelled out in the legal documents. Semi-annual progress reports will be submitted by the&#13;
CPC to the PIU, which will act as coordinator for all financial reporting. The PIU's quarterly reporting&#13;
will include a separate report with respect to the Special Account. An Implementation Completion&#13;
Report will be submitted to the Association by the PIU promptly after the completion of the program, not&#13;
later than six months after the Credit's closing date.&#13;
3.22    Auditing. Financial statements and reports on the Credit (including the Special Account) will&#13;
be audited by an auditor acceptable to the Association and audit reports will be submitted to the&#13;
Association within six months of the end of the fiscal year. Selected auditors must be: (1) impartial and&#13;
independent from the entity to be audited; (2) well-established and reputable; (3) experienced in the type&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of assignment to be undertaken; and (4) able to fulfil! the terms of reference required within the specific&#13;
timetable.&#13;
3.23    Project Supervision. The proposed project focuses on the establishment of a new institution,&#13;
the Competitiveness and Productivity Center, through which the project's components will be&#13;
implemented. There will be a strong emphasis on Association supervision to ensure that the activities of&#13;
the CPC conform with plans and agreements. Program supervision input by Association staff is therefore&#13;
expected to be above average, particularly at the early stage of project implementation. The use of the&#13;
existing PIU from PSD I will help facilitate smooth project implementation and supervision. In addition,&#13;
annual, audited reports will be prepared by an auditor acceptable to the Association and audit reports will&#13;
be submitted to the Association within six months of the end of the CPC's fiscal year. A mid-term&#13;
review, scheduled for 2 years after implementation,--tentatively scheduled for June 1999--will review the&#13;
Project's success in meeting its objectives and mid-course adjustments will be made as appropriate.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    Project Benefits&#13;
4.1    Anticipated benefits of the proposed Project are:&#13;
(i)    strengthening the management capacity of managers of new private and privatized firms;&#13;
(ii)   providing a supply response for the Government's stated policy of export promotion by&#13;
improving the competitiveness of firms through on-the-job secondments to&#13;
internationally competitive firms;&#13;
(iii)  improvement in the quality of products through an introduction of Total Quality&#13;
Management and access to informational database benchmarks; and&#13;
(iv)   enabling the absorption of lessons learned by those firms unable to participate in the&#13;
Project through extensive dissemination efforts of the CPC.&#13;
B.    Project Risks&#13;
4.2    The Project risks to be addressed are complex and diversified: institutional, cultural, and&#13;
psychological. Similar Centers have well established track records in providing successful assistance to&#13;
enterprises in other emerging economies, such as those in Asia. The lessons learned in those countries,&#13;
although strongly encouraging, may be of limited importance in Moldova--a country with a different&#13;
cultural and economic background. The project, in particular, faces the following risks:&#13;
(i)   the selection mechanism for participation in the secondment program may not&#13;
effectively identify those managers willing to change and follow through with&#13;
dissemination efforts organized by the CPC--the Letter of Understanding has been&#13;
drafted to specifically address this risk;&#13;
(ii)   possible decline of Governmental commitment that would lead to pressure on the CPC&#13;
resulting in the selection of non-qualified managers to the program so that the&#13;
secondments become junkets -- the Project design requiring the firm's financing of all&#13;
the local costs specifically addresses this risk through mandatory, pre-secondment&#13;
training in languages, basic computer skills, and management; and&#13;
(iii)  institutional weakness of the CPC which would lead to the inefficient dissemination of&#13;
lessons learned from the on-the-job-placements-technical assistance has been&#13;
incorporated into the project design specifically to address this risk&#13;
4.3    The project design introduces a number of measures for early identification of symptoms, their&#13;
prevention, and mitigation of consequences. These measures are:&#13;
(i)   full transparency of the process of attracting and selecting candidates;&#13;
(ii)    measurable tests for skills proficiency of candidates, published in advance;&#13;
(iii)   measurable and detailed performance indicators for subcontracted secondments&#13;
coordinators in host countries;&#13;
(iv)   financial commitment of participants and a very stringent budget of government&#13;
financial support;&#13;
(v)    close, formal and informal, links of the Project Team with the CPC Supervisory Board,&#13;
management and staff.&#13;
4.4    All of these should lead to the Program's perception as being an attractive but fair and "no pain&#13;
no gain" investment in professional skills.&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
A. Agreements&#13;
5.1   During negotiations, agreements were reached on all Credit documentation, as well as the&#13;
following:&#13;
(i) the establishment and appropriate staffing of the CPC (para's. 3.2 and 3.4); (ii) the specific set&#13;
of eligibility criteria for participants in the Marshall Plan (para. 3.8); (iii) the Participation&#13;
Agreement between the CPC and participating enterprise including a Letter of Understanding&#13;
between the CPC and the seconded managers (para 3.6); (iv) completion of a draft Funds Transfer&#13;
Agreement between the MOF and the CPC (para 3.2); (v) General Procurement Notice for QCBS&#13;
of Contract Services (para 3.13); and (vi) confirmation on type of Bank lending instrument.&#13;
5.2   As effectiveness conditions:&#13;
(i) The appointment to the PIU of professional staff who would be in charge of day-to-day&#13;
operations regarding PSD II.&#13;
(ii) Satisfactory version of a Funds Transfer Agreement between the MOF and the CPC will be&#13;
signed by the responsible parties and delivered to the Association.&#13;
(iii) The appointment of the CPC's Supervisory Board and its President&#13;
B.    Recommendations&#13;
5.3   The proposed Project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit to the Republic of Moldova.&#13;
The Credit will be in and amount equivalent to SDR 6.6 million (US$9.0 million), with 35 years&#13;
maturity, including a grace period of 10 years.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
An Agreement Between the Competitiveness and Productivity Center and an Enterprise&#13;
Participating in&#13;
"Investment in Improvement of Managerial Skills Program"&#13;
[The Guidelines]&#13;
1.    Background. It is the Government policy and priority to increase managerial capacity of&#13;
recently privatized enterprises in industrial and agro-processing sectors and to improve their&#13;
productivity and competitiveness domestically and internationally. One of the important&#13;
components of this policy is an "Investment in Improvement of Managerial Skills Program" (the&#13;
Program). The program is a vehicle for investing in managerial skills through on-the-job training&#13;
for managers of privatized enterprises by way of secondments to leading industrial counterparts&#13;
in Central and Western Europe and East Asia. The implementation of this Program has been&#13;
entrusted to a Competitiveness and Productivity Center (CPC), an independent, non-&#13;
governmental and non-profit organization.&#13;
2.    The basic objective of the Program is the extensive exposure of management of private&#13;
and recently privatized enterprises to new concepts of market-oriented management, marketing,&#13;
and production. This will be followed by dissemination to non-participating firms in Moldova.&#13;
3.    Targeted Participants and Eligibility Criteria. Eligible firms willing to designate&#13;
managers for the Program have to be private, without any overdue obligations to the state&#13;
budget or privatized firms in the process of restructuring following the creditor-led restructuring&#13;
program within the framework agreed under the PSD I. The targeted participants are medium-to&#13;
senior-level managers from private/privatized companies from industrial and agro-processing&#13;
sectors with passive knowledge of English or a language of a visited country, basic computer&#13;
skills and knowledge of management techniques, and strong motivation to learn. Candidates will&#13;
have to commit to a rigorous and demanding work program. The candidates have to prove their&#13;
passive knowledge of English or a language of a secondment country, computer skills (word&#13;
processing, spread sheet, presentation package, Internet), as well as knowledge of basic&#13;
management techniques and continuous improvement. The Center will organize, for fee, a&#13;
crash-course training for selected candidates in the above mentioned areas. The candidates will&#13;
be obliged by this contract to "pay back" this investment through their availability for follow-up&#13;
dissemination activities.&#13;
4.    The Program Components. The Program will have three components (blocks):&#13;
preparatory training qualifying managers for the second block of secondments abroad, and the&#13;
third block for finalizing a detailed report from the secondments and its dissemination in&#13;
Moldova.&#13;
5.    BLOCK I: MOLDOVA.Crash Course [320 hours]. Language, Computer Skills (Word&#13;
Processor, Spreadsheet, Presentation Package, Basics of Management Techniques (Strategy of&#13;
Continuously Improving Firms, Finance, Marketing, Human Resources Management, Quality&#13;
Control)&#13;
6.    BLOCK II: ABROAD. The secondment period will be divided into two modules: a 12&#13;
week Basic Module and a 4 to 8 weeks Optional Module. A standard week work load will be as&#13;
follow: (1) four days in host firm on-the-job training, (2) one day in-class training based on case&#13;
studies and specific management courses, (3) one day of report preparation. The second&#13;
(Optional) module would also consist of visits to other leading firms. To minimize the costs and&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
to maximize the synergy effect, participants will be organized in groups. The standard group will&#13;
consist of three members visiting the same host firm. For training purposes two to four groups&#13;
can be combined.&#13;
7.    BLOCK III: MOLDOVA. One week: debriefing and finalizing the report and&#13;
preparation of presentations with assistance of the CPC; three weeks of dissemination by series&#13;
of workshops and visits to Moldovan enterprises.&#13;
8.    Approximate Costs per Participant. Average costs of secondments abroad for the&#13;
Basic Secondment [90 days, per person in a group of 3 people each] would be between US $&#13;
23,000 - 28,000; including transportation 500; per diem 3,600 [90 days @ 40]; accommodation&#13;
4,500 [90 days @ 60]; training and report preparation 7,200 [24 days @ 3001; host company&#13;
6,000 [60 days @ 100]; overhead costs (5%).&#13;
The Optional Module would cost additional 10,000 - 20,000&#13;
The actual cost will differ depending on country of secondment and enterprise fees should be&#13;
reflected in the contract.&#13;
9.    Cost Sharing. The participating firm will be required to cover the local costs during the&#13;
first and the last blocks of training, per diem abroad, and transportation costs to and from the&#13;
Secondment, up to US$ 5,000. The remaining costs will be covered by the Government or&#13;
donors. To secure participation of SMEs--which can economically justify only very small&#13;
expenditures on training--in exceptional cases, larger part of costs may be covered by the&#13;
Government or grant financing. In case the demand among qualifying enterprises is greater than&#13;
the available financing, these resources will be auctioned to those enterprises prepared to cover&#13;
bigger percentage of the overall costs from their own resources.&#13;
10.   Dissemination. On their return, the participants will complete, with the assistance of the&#13;
CPC staff, a thorough written report, including technological information on the operations of&#13;
the visited firm, performance studies, quality control, job structure and management, accounting&#13;
and financing systems, marketing channels and techniques, export promotion. They will convene&#13;
a series of workshop, to transfer a new know-how acquired by the secondment participants.&#13;
Seconded managers will also assist the CPC in preparation of the next secondments and follow-&#13;
up activities. The costs of dissemination related to participation of a manager will be covered by&#13;
the participating firm and are included in the up to $5000 figure.&#13;

            The Second Private Sector Development
            Project's principal objective is to assist the
            Government in its efforts to increase the managerial
            capacity of recently privatized enterprises and thus,
            improve their productivity and competitiveness.  The project
            will support two activities: a) a competitiveness component,
            Investing in Best Practice Information (IBPI), which will
            invest in information by providing benchmarks to enterprise
            and sector performance as well as identification of domestic
            and international opportunities; and b) a productivity
            component, Investing in Improvement of Managerial Skills
            (IIMS), which will invest in human resources through the
            provision of on-the-job training of managers abroad.
