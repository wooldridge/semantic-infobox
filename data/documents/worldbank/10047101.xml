        <abstracts>
            The handwashing public private
            partnership was established in 2003 with the main objective
            to promote and institutionalize the handwashing practice
            with soap among low income families, to significantly reduce
            children diarrhea incidence and mortality in the country. A
            behavioral study was performed during the first year,
            fundraising became a key activity during the first two
            years, and implementation started in 2005. So far, important
            lessons have been gathered in the process of partnership
            building, as a wide range of institutions have joined the
            effort at different stages and, as 2006 begins, this seems
            to be a powerful growing trend.
