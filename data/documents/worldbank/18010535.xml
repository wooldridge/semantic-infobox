Memorialist: James E. Twinin&amp; Jr.&#13;
&#13;
Date of interview: May 2, 1985&#13;
&#13;
Place of interview: The World Bank, Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
Interviewer: John Muir&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Today is May 2, 1985. My name is John Muir of the Oral History Program, and I have with&#13;
me here at the headquarters of the World Bank, Mr. James E. Twining, Jr. Mr. Twm.ing had a&#13;
distinguished career in our institution that spanned more than three decades. He joined the Bank in&#13;
1950 as an assistant personnel officer. In 1951 he became assistant personnel manager. In 1960 he&#13;
transferred to what was then called the Technical Assistance and Planning Department. He returned&#13;
to the Administration Department in 1963, becoming its deputy director in 1964. In September 1971&#13;
Mr. Twining was appointed Director of the Administrative Services Department. He remained its&#13;
Director until his retirement in May 1983.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Welcome back, Mr. Twining. Perhaps we can start by focusing on the subject of personnel&#13;
management during the early years of the Bank. You began in the Bank as an assistant personnel&#13;
officer. Could you describe the mechanics of personnel work in the Bank when you joined and also&#13;
dicuss its early evolution?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Thank you, John. I certainly would be glad to. This is a two-part question. Let's deal&#13;
with the mechanics first. It must be remembered that the Bank at the time I joined had, I think,. 400&#13;
staff members, and the Personnel Division was a very small division in a relatively small Administration&#13;
Department. The organizational units of the entire Bank at that time were smalL The Division, as I&#13;
knew it, had 11 people in it, and we were dealing with a total Bank staff of 40 times that. The&#13;
mec:.hanies of the operation were very much the way they arc today, although very small in size. The&#13;
personnel work was much more informal. There were many fewer rules. There were many fewer&#13;
forms. The forms were rudimentary. We had at that time a black book, which became famous in the&#13;
Bank on the operational side. Everything was put into black books. But our black book was the staff&#13;
roster, and information was put in it by pen. So, if you wanted to see bow many people there were in&#13;
department X or department Y, you looked at the staff roster. There were very few policies.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                           -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
     However, all of the essential tasks of good personnel work were included in the operation of the&#13;
small Personnel Division that I first joined. We had recruitment and placement responsibilities. We&#13;
had job classification; more later on that. We had salary policy. We had transfers of staff from one&#13;
department to another. We had a termination policy. despite the fact that we were a very youag&#13;
organization. There were many staff relations problems in those early years. We had a health program&#13;
which was operating very much the way it does today, except there was one person instead of a whole&#13;
department. We hired a number of consultants for Bank missions, but these missions were missions to&#13;
member countries. They were not resident missions. There were no resideut missions at that time.&#13;
There was a Paris Office. and later there would be a London Office for the IFC when it became an&#13;
affiliate of the Bank. But the funelions that personnel work requires were all performed in this small&#13;
division in very much the same way that they're performed today. So my answer really is that the&#13;
mechanics haven't changed all that much. They have improved in many ways, due to improvements in&#13;
tedmology for one thing, but basically you're doing the same type of thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Back to the question of job classification. One of the first assignments I bad given to me when I&#13;
joined the staff was to be chairman of the so-caUed B-Comm.ittee. The B-Com.mittee was the&#13;
committee that was dealins with the classitieation of non-professional positions, and the company that&#13;
had been hired by the World Bank to do this was Edward N. Hay and Associates. I know that when I&#13;
left the Bank, Edward N. Hay and Associates were back here mak.iag another staff job classification,&#13;
and I gather it's still going on and bas not been concluded. I can just say that the one we did in 1950&#13;
and 1951--l think it started in 1951 actually-was never very wen accepted. The results were suspeCI, I&#13;
think, and, although we did reclassify jobs based upon rh.e Edward N.Hay study, over the course of time&#13;
that study was forgotten and c:baoges were made in the classification without benefit of it. I bope that&#13;
isn't the fate of the eurreut study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: If I may interject, according to Asher _and Mason's study, the job classification system&#13;
introduced by Vice President Robert L. Garner shortly after his arrival at the Bank was never&#13;
completed. From the early 1950s until1969 salaries were fixed without any clear or consistent&#13;
relationship to formal titles. Does that sound correct?&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1WINING: That's basically what it was. The staff began to grow on a steady upward course in tbe&#13;
mid-1950s, after having declined from a high of approximately four hundred fifty to around four&#13;
hundred in the early 1950s. But as the staff grew; of course, the Personnel Division grew as weD and&#13;
the informality that I referred to of the way we operatedÂ·-the mechanics-became much more&#13;
systematized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The basic change, I think, which was required to deal with the increases in pel'SODD.el questions and&#13;
personneJ problems, was that the early staff hired were people who you might refer to as jacks-of-all&#13;
trade. They eould do a little recruitment, they could do a little classification, and they could do a little&#13;
sala:ry administration. None was an expert in any one thiDg. What happened thereafter was that we&#13;
began to hire people because of their specific expertise: persoas who were experts in personnel&#13;
administration, in the first place, and secondly, who had a particulat skill in recruitment or in&#13;
classification or in salary administration. We hired a placement officer, for example. We hired a&#13;
training officer, which we had not had prior to tbat time. We created a consultant recruitment section&#13;
because the hiring of consultants had taken so much of the time of the staff of the smaJI division.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We refined, to a certain extent, the salary increase system that was in place. But the annual salary&#13;
reviews, I think they're now called, at that time were called personnel reviews, and I remember very&#13;
weD that the Personnel Manager, who was Donald D. Fowler, and I would get from the supervisors of&#13;
all of the professional and the non-professional staff their evaluations of their staff members. generally&#13;
written in a very informal way. We would go over these with those supervisors, and agree on a position&#13;
with respect to the performance of each staff member.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then Mr. Fowler and I would sit down \'\lith none less than the Vice President, Mr. Garner, and go&#13;
over all the professional staff evaluations. Mr. Garner would either comment on the evaluations in&#13;
general, or he had something to say about the individuals. In most cases, of course, he simply accepted&#13;
what we had agreed with the supervisor as to the rating of the individual But in many cases he knew&#13;
the persons weD. He'd seen them behave in front of the Board, and he had his own ideas as to how&#13;
they were performing. Sometimes tbat bad an effect on the salary increase given to the staff member.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[1WINING]&#13;
    Of course, in today's Personnel Department it would be unheard of to sit down with the Vice&#13;
President. It's enough, I guess, that they do let the Vice Presidents know what's recommended in the&#13;
departments, but I don't know how far up it goes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    One sidelight on the subject of personnel work in those days: this was, as you may or may not&#13;
remember, the McCarthy era in the United States. Senator Joe McCarthy was a Communist-hater and&#13;
had done a great deal to have laws passed to tighten security checks on Americans to keep Communists&#13;
from getting jobs in iotemational organ.i7.ations. As a result of this, United States citizens who wanted&#13;
to join the Bank had to be cleared by the State Department. We had to submit information to the U.S.&#13;
State Department and wait until their investigative officers, whoever they were, gave the green light to&#13;
hire Mr. X or Mr. Y, who was an American. Others who were hired in those days, whether they were&#13;
Czechs or PolesÂ·Â·and both cotllltries were members of the Bank at that time--could get on the staff of&#13;
the Bank within ten minutes, or whatever time it took us to process them. But an American had to&#13;
wait until he was cleared by his own government. This. of course, created a certain number of delays in&#13;
recruitment, and it also made it difficult to staff missions, because you never knew whether the man&#13;
you were hiring was going to get cleared, or wasn't going to get cleared, and secondly, how long it&#13;
would take. It generally was taking six to eight weeks, so once yt~u'd decided to hire Mr. X or Mr. Y&#13;
you had to wait six to eight weeks before he could come on the payroll It was a difficult time, and&#13;
personnel work was made difficult because of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Can I just ask you a question with regard to the annual review? You talked about evaluation&#13;
of performance and determination of salary inerease. Was there any discussion of that with the staff&#13;
member in those days, or was that stric:tly a supervisory task?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: It was a supervisory task. The staff member, of course, had the opportunity, if he felt&#13;
aggrieved because of the increase he'd been given, to appeal. But it was not in any way discussed with&#13;
him in advance. There were no clear lines giving the staff member the opportunity to show what he&#13;
had done during the year which, in his view, merited consideration for increases of higher than normal&#13;
size. It was very largely from the top down.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: This was a concept that probably was oDly introduced in the early 1910s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: The collcgi.al concept. yes.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                            -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: I think we covered part two, or do you have more to add to the question?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Well, part of two had to do with the typical staff member working in personnel-related&#13;
matters when I joined. The Assistant D.i:rector of the Administration Department in those years was&#13;
William F. Howell. Bill Howell was a graduate of the MaxweU School of Citizenship and Public Affairs&#13;
of Syracuse University, and he was very keen to get staff in the administration field who bad&#13;
professional qualifications, both academic and work-related. I guess I could be considered a typical&#13;
hire for the Personnel Department at that time, and my background was very muc:b.like his. I have a&#13;
BA. in government and economics from Union College and an M.S. from Syracuse in the Maxwell&#13;
School, and I had had four or five years in personnel work, both in the Federal Housing Agency and in&#13;
the State Department. So I considered myself at the time a qualified personnel administrator. This is&#13;
the kind of person that I think Howell encouraged to be brought into the Bank. Over the years more&#13;
and more of the staff who were hired were professional persoanel administrators or had professional&#13;
experience in either general administration or in personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: How was staff recruited when you joined? That is, did the Bank actively seek out reauits, or&#13;
did they come to the Bank and ask to join?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Recruitment in the early years was perhaps less difficult than it became later, and perhaps&#13;
than it is today. The initiative was with the Bank. There was very little referral from, say, Board&#13;
members or others who wanted to have their countrymen employed, or their relatives employed, or&#13;
anythiDg of that kind. But there was a large number of people who were applying to the Bank then,&#13;
seeking employment from Europe where, as you know, conditions were such that there weren't as&#13;
many opportunities for professional staff. So we had a large pool of candidates from whic:b. to choose.&#13;
It was also difficult in those early years to find Americans who had foreign experience. UDlil::e the&#13;
British and the French, who bad large c:olooial empires that they had overseen in the years before the&#13;
war--and wac still doq at that time--America had few, and therefore the nonÂ·U.S. were better&#13;
qualified to deal with the underdeveloped countries' problems than the Americans were.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINlNG&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING}&#13;
     However, I think the Bank's standards were always very high. We had rather thorough interviews&#13;
with any candidate at the Personnel Division level and with department heads. There were not so&#13;
many of them, and the numbers of people being hired were not so numerous that it was not Â·possible to&#13;
get the highest level interview that you wanted. Very often department heads themselves did the&#13;
interviewing and could decide even very low level positions in their departments. At the starting&#13;
professional level the department head himself would take time to interview, which I doubt happens&#13;
today. I think they might interview for those people close to their own level, but certainly they delegate&#13;
to the division chiefs and others the right to interview and decide, with Personnel's approval, hiring&#13;
today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I made many recruitment trips in th05e days with department heads,. espedally to Europe. We&#13;
would spend our time interviewiug candidates in all of the countries. On one trip, in 1959, I was gone&#13;
for a month-and-a-half. I went to nine different countries looki.ag for staff in Europe; just back and&#13;
forth from Italy all the way up to the Scandinavian countries and through Germany.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: For specific jobs, or just to find potential recruits?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: We always started out with a shopping list of specific jobs, but obviously you don't always&#13;
end up finding the pt:aple you wanted for those jobs, so you would find others who suited other jobs.&#13;
One sidelight I remember: I made an extensive recruitment trip one year with Siem Aldewereld. who&#13;
was later to become Vice President. At that time he was head of the Teclmical Operations&#13;
Department, or whatever it was called. Many of our recruitment trips were organized by a local official&#13;
of the member country government They knew we were coming, they advertised for candidates, and&#13;
they would organize the recruiting interview session. I remember in the U.K. it was a fellow called Sit&#13;
George Gater, who had an office in the bowels of the Treasury. When I looked at my office in&#13;
Washington and compared it to his, I was very hapPY I was in Wasbingtoo. But he seemed hapPY&#13;
enough with what he bad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In Germany our interviewing was always done around a large table, and there was the poor&#13;
candidate who was led in almost on tether and sat in a chair. Thea there was a whole bunch of&#13;
government officials alonpidc, and then there were Aldewereld and I. After one or two of these trips,&#13;
he said wpm going to sit opposite you. I don't want to sit alongside of you when I interview. I'll Jet you&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                             -7Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
know what I think of the candidate. If I put my hand on the table with a thumb up I think we ought to&#13;
go on with interviewing, and if the thumb goes down forget it. Stop the interview as soon as you can."&#13;
That was very successful. I mean, there wasn't any point in our both sitting there thinking this guy is a&#13;
real dud and prolonging the agony of the interview for both him and for us. So we had signals of that&#13;
kind which speeded things up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We never had a quota system in the Bank, as people have often thought. But with American&#13;
applicants so close at hand, it was difficult to keep the desired mix of staff. In those days I think the&#13;
U.S. contributed almost fafty percent of the funds to the Bank. And so it evolved that there were far&#13;
more Americans than any other nationality on the staff of the Bank. As the years have gone by that&#13;
number has been dropping steadily. I think in those days the U.S. had maybe 55 percent of the staff&#13;
members, the British followed with 17 percent. and the French with 6 and on down. But we did go out&#13;
of our way--and an of the department heads and an of the managers who helped in the recruitment&#13;
effort folJowed suit--to be sure that we bad a mix of aU nationalities. In a single department it was&#13;
especially difficult. You didn't want to end up with a department which bad predominantly one or the&#13;
other nationality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Can I interject? You say approximately seveaty percent were Americans and British. Would&#13;
there have been an Anglo..Sa:xon bias in the Penonnel Department because of the fact that there were&#13;
a lot of Americans, let's say, in Personnel?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Yes, fm sure that this might have been considered. The Personnel Division in those days&#13;
consisted of. as I said. 11 or 12--it began to grow rather rapidly--but there were more Americans than&#13;
any other nationaJity in the Division. The whole Administration Department, I think, eertainly had&#13;
more Amerieans than it has today. But we were con.stantly reminded, if the rwnon got too rampant&#13;
that we were biased. that we couldn't be. This is why we spent so much of our time recruiting abroad.&#13;
We wouldn't have bad to do that. Even if we had advertised abroad and had gotten a lot of&#13;
applicatioas as a result of that advertising, we might have done fairly well at attracting non-Americans.&#13;
But we went even further than that and we spent a fair amount of the Bank's money recruiting&#13;
throughout Europe over those years. That was one of the reasons. It was partly because we needed&#13;
the expertise that those people had. and the Amerieans particularly didnl have. but it was also because&#13;
we realized we couldn't have as many Americans as we could pick up off the stre~t easily.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[1WINING]&#13;
     There was an old boy network that existed as well. The department heads were of .several&#13;
nationalities; they weren't predominantly Ameriam in those days. We got many of the Dutch because&#13;
Aldewereld was a Dutchman; we got many of the British because S. R. Cope was a Briton, we got many&#13;
of the French because Leonard Rist was a Frenchman. But we worked hard at that.It was difficult&#13;
because. on the one hand. you had the department sayiDg if we am't get our staff in a hurry we're not&#13;
going to be able to make this many loans. and Mr. Black was pushing for an increase in the number of&#13;
loans and Bank activity. On the other hand. if you went the easy way you ended up with Americans and&#13;
British. because there were more of them available than other nationalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Was there any attempt to recruit outside America and Western Europe?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'IWINING: There was. The largest number that we tried to bite in those days outside of Europe and&#13;
the U.S. was in South America. Of COlll'SCt the Asian countries didn't produce a great many candidates&#13;
with the kind of experience we wanted. All of the Afriam countries were co1onies of the large&#13;
European countries, and they too lacked the academic training that we thought we needed. But there&#13;
was an attempt made, and we had several recruitment missions to South America where we were able&#13;
to hire a fair number of less developed country nationals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Were these policy decisions made at a high level or, let's say, from Mr. Fowler down?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'IWINlNG: It"s hard to say. I'm sure that these were discussed at high levels, and it was passed on to&#13;
us. But, as I say, all of the department heads were very much aware of the desirability of having an&#13;
international staff. It really didn't have to be dictated. It was something that was more or Jess inherent&#13;
in the job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: It's been said that the introduction of the professional and the nonÂ·professioual categories did&#13;
much to undermiue the initial cohesiveness and morale of the staff. espedally, of course, the morale of&#13;
the non-professio.aal staff. Could you give us some background on the process by which this distinction&#13;
was introduced?&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                             -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: As far as I remember, there was always a distinction between the professional and the&#13;
non-professional. I don't remember it being introduced in any way. I believe that it always existed. I&#13;
think, however, the distinction, which later became a problem--and which has largely, I guess, now been&#13;
overcome by various methods---was no problem for the early Bank. The Bank under Mr. Blade,&#13;
especially, was almost a family-style operation. Everyone knew almost everyone else. There was very&#13;
little, of tbe attitude of servant and master. I think that probably had more to do with the harmony than&#13;
anything else, but I think that the distinction between professional and non-professional was always&#13;
understood in fact, as I mentioned earlier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    When the Edward N. Hay Associates came, their grading exercise was divided into two classes.&#13;
There was the A-Committee that dealt with the so-called higher level, or I guess professional, and&#13;
there was the B-Com.mittec that dealt with all others: the secretaries, the clerks, the messengers, those&#13;
who, I suppose. would then have been considered non-professional.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I was thinking bade as to what resulted from this distinction and I, for the life of me, can't think of&#13;
any specific problem that arose. Of course, we had no Staff Association in those days. The pay for all&#13;
jobs was relatively high in comparison with the pay that you could get on the outside. It wasn't until the&#13;
Bank began to grow by leaps and bounds, in the mid-siJ.t.ies and on, that this became a significant&#13;
problem. But I'm sure that people were considered professional or non-professiona1, and the&#13;
distinction was there and you lived with it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Of course, there's been a large increase in the number of women in the market place recently.&#13;
This may have had some impact on that. Could you dcsc:n'bc the role of women in the Bank, especially&#13;
in terms of the recruitment, or promotion to higher level positions in the early days.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: WeU, women always were large in numbers in the Bank. For almost every staff member&#13;
that was eagased I think there was a seaetarial position, and in those days there were very few, if any.&#13;
male secretaries. So we had a cadre of large numbers of women almost from the very ~.ginning.&#13;
Those women who had what you can call professional status in those days were very largely in the non-&#13;
operational side of Bank activit:ies. The Administration Department had a number. The Public:&#13;
Relations Department had a number. There were one or two lawyers. The Controller's Department&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING)&#13;
had some. But. by and large, the operational departments had none. In PersoJlllCl, for instaocc, wheo&#13;
I ftrst came to the Bank, there were oDiy two males. One was Mr. Michael Lejeune, a Briton-an&#13;
American actually, but he was born in Britain--and Yann LeRoux who was a Frenchman. AU the rest&#13;
were women. It wasn't really until the last year or so of Mr. Woods' presidency, and aD through Mr.&#13;
McNamara's reign. that women were sought for opcratioos, and that in the reeruitiog formula, in&#13;
addition to continuing the mix of nationa1ities, you bad women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In addition to that, there has since been another element and that is the less developed country&#13;
nationals, especl.ally newly emerged African countries. But in the early years. and before that&#13;
expansion, there was really not too much effort made to find profcssiooal positions for women. I think&#13;
the fust lady to reach department bead status was probably Shirley Boskcy in the DeveJopmcnt&#13;
Services Department, and I gues&amp; the fust lady to make it to Vice President was Anne Krueger, who&#13;
was just recently appointed a ViCe President from outside. None has been promoted to Vice PresidenL&#13;
But there were always in Administration, the Marjorie Billingses and the Lacy Carters, and when I got&#13;
there Mrs. Geib, who was bead of Staff Relations, who was the Lacy Carter of her time, and so forth.&#13;
We've never had a shortage of women, quote, "professionals: on the administrative side of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Here again, were there any clear policies set out in terms of quotas? Wa there any feeling&#13;
that perhaps on the operational side there could be prejudice against female economists, loan officers,&#13;
project officers in the field on mission?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Certainly, to my knowledge, there was never any directive issued which said either you&#13;
must or you mustn't have a female in your department, in your division. or what have you. There&#13;
clearly wa&amp; aa effort made, and it was a clearly understood effort, to attract women to the Bank. I&#13;
remember sitting in meetinp with the Director of Administration in which the numbers of women that&#13;
had been hired in the past month waa a subject of discussion. Why was it only 11? Why didn't we hire&#13;
15, or something like that? But in terms of a specific quota, I never remember there being one, any&#13;
more than I remember there being a spec:i6c quota for less developed countries or other minorities. I&#13;
think the Bank was careful, and has always been careful, to recruit the kind of people it needs, and if&#13;
emphasis is given at any given moment to this type or that type, so be it.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                            Â·11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
     There is an effort made to attract candidates, but without any impo&amp;ed quota. and no department&#13;
head, to my knowledge, was ever told you have to take this person because he or she is a minority, or&#13;
we're on a big drive to increase the number of this type or that type on the staff. I caD't speak for what&#13;
the Personnel Department has been since about 1971, when I left it, but I would guess that they have&#13;
never had a quota either. Everything I've said applies to that time from 1950 to 1971. Thereafter I&#13;
recruited only for my own department, with the help of Personnel. I Jmow what we did. We didn't go&#13;
out of our way to find a specific color or sex or anything else for the department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Let's try and wrap up on PersonneL Do you have any feelings as to how, during your period in&#13;
Personnel, the Division or Department, was perceived by the rest of the staff, and did that perception&#13;
change when you suddenly became a user of Personnel services?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: I think that the Personnel Division, when it was a small division within the Administration&#13;
Department in the very early years of my career, was looked upon as a very helpful and essential&#13;
administrative aid to the growing Bank. Department heads, Vice Presidents, the President, were aU&#13;
fairly generous in their praise of what the Personnel Division, smaD as it was, could do. and was doing.&#13;
I think, as the Bank grew and as the Personnel Division grew, finally to become a department as you&#13;
know, some of that gloss wore off, and there was a change, especially after the Staff Association came&#13;
into being. I'm sure. there had always been in the Bank staff members who felt the Personnel Division&#13;
was not entirely objective in its approach to salary administration, in its approach to determiniDg&#13;
starting salaries, in its approach to internal reassignments. probably in its approach to terminations that&#13;
were forced. But it wasn't really until the early days of the Staff Association that there wu a move to&#13;
force Personnel to reveal how it did its work,. and how it determined what salaries 'Were going to be,&#13;
and why the cost of living should be X and the salary increase be Y. It wasn't until then, I think,. that&#13;
the real gloss that I always felt was on the personnel function in the Bank began to tarnish.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    II I remember correctly, the Staff Association began its life when I was Deputy Director of the&#13;
Administration Department and thea it continued during the time I was Director of Administrative&#13;
Services. I think that those days were difficult days., not because of the existence of the Staff&#13;
Association, but they were difficult days anyway for the administration in the Bank. That was the era&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
of tremendous growth and the administrative staff, including PerSOD.OCI. were very busy people and&#13;
they, I fee~ bad the seue that here was an ann~: the Staff Ass.ociatiou, a staff UDion. If they&#13;
would just go away and let us continue what we'd been do.iDg so well things would be all right. We&#13;
were much too busy, I guess, to really work hard to face up to this o.cw situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     But I think prior to that time, in answer to your specl.fic question, that the personnel function and&#13;
the personnel team were looked upon very favorably, as helpful and tryiDg their best to do what they&#13;
had to do, with obvious minor exceptions. People who were fired were unhappy with it, and those who&#13;
didn't get the salary increases they thought they should get were uuhappy, and those who were assigned&#13;
to some places they didn't want to be assigned were unhappy. and that's inevitable.      But I would pess&#13;
that it wasn't until the years either just prior to or after the creation of the Staff Association that the&#13;
personnel function was looked upon as a little bit less than helpful, and in some cases suspect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: In retrospect. do you think the Staff Association affected the evolution of the Personnel&#13;
Department, and was it in a positive way; did it come up with ideas that, in fact. pushed Personnel in&#13;
the right directiou, or not?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Yes. I think history will show that the creation of the Staff Association was a useful thing.&#13;
It's funny. In the Fund there was a Fund Staff Association almost &amp;om the very beginning. It became&#13;
rather dormant at about the time the Bank's Staff Association was betomiug very active. But I&#13;
remember we used to sympathize with our colleagues in the Fund Personnel Division that they were&#13;
dealing with this band of unionites who were trying to force the Fund to do things that the Fund&#13;
administration knew very well they didn't want to do. But I think probably the Staff Association was a&#13;
helpful thing. Whether it could have been introduced in a less antagonistic way, I don't know. But, I&#13;
think, in the end it probably did make Personnel stop and look at its procedures and its policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Of course, a big problem with the Staff Association and Personnel was the fault of neither. It was&#13;
a management decision as to whether we would pay X or Y dollan, and it was a management decision&#13;
as to whether the cost of Uving increase would be the full cost of living inc:rcase or a portion of it. In&#13;
many cases it was a management decision as to what groups would be trausfered to what, and what&#13;
departments would be c:reated out of what departm.ents. and all of these .issues that the Staff&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[1WINING]&#13;
Association then were forced to take up on behalf of the staff were above the Personnel/Staff&#13;
Association negotiation. It was something that neither could do much about. And, of course, I think a&#13;
great many of the senior staff, including Mr. McNamara himself, had many comrontations with the&#13;
Staff Association. I know that he bad regular meetings with them, and he at least listened to what they&#13;
had to say.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I, as a Department Director, had regular meetings with the Staff Association. We would have a&#13;
formal agenda, and they would come and meet with us and discuss the items on the agenda. We would&#13;
agree or disagree on things that they recommended be done. In those cases, the Staff A.ssoci.ation was&#13;
generally acting as the spokesman for a small group, maybe the printers, or maybe the messengers, or&#13;
maybe the chauffeurs, and it was not global It was not a Bank-wide issue. The travel policy was one&#13;
with wbich we had many, many rounds with the Staff Association aDd, there again, while we had the&#13;
opportunity to make recommendatious as to what the travel policy should be, there were certain limits&#13;
imposed by management and decisious taken by management, correct or incorrect, that earried the&#13;
day. And the Staff Association had to live with that It was a difficult time, but what they achieved was&#13;
to get all of the departments of the Bank who dealt with the conditious of life for the staff as a whole,&#13;
to think carefully about issues that had a serious effed on the way people behaved in the iustitution.&#13;
Maybe we didn't do enough of that before the Staff Association came along.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: You used the term management, as opposed to PersonneL Are you suggcstiag that&#13;
management might have contradicted some of the recommendations or advice of the Personnel&#13;
Department?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Oh, yes, surely. By management I mean a Vice President sitting on top of a group of&#13;
departments. There is of course, big management: the President. But let's assume that management is&#13;
the Vice President. There were a number of cases where the Vic:e President asked the Personnel&#13;
Department, or the Administration Department prior to that, to come up with a proposal for X or Y:&#13;
salary increase fot the year, or a new method for integrating returni.ng field mission staff-1 don't know&#13;
what it might be--and Personne~ after much thought, would come up with a proposal. Then&#13;
management would say go back to the drawing board. I don't like that proposal, or for this or that&#13;
reason it's not possible to do it that way, or I've checked with the President and be won't have it that&#13;
way, or whatever. So Personnel, or any other department, might be conversing with the Staff&#13;
Association.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
     Ia the days when the Staff Association became wen established, and when we were holding nothing&#13;
back, we would put it on the table what we were thinking of proposing. U it were the travel policy, we&#13;
would put it on the table when we discussed with the Staff Association: well we're thinking of lettiDg&#13;
people use business class, and we're still going to cut back on rust dass.. but business class win be more&#13;
or less the norm. You won't always have to go economy, And the Staff Association would know we&#13;
were doing that, and then we'd come back the next week and say, suddealy, we're not going to have&#13;
business class, we're going to stick with ec;onomy. I don't know if that ever ac:tually happened in that&#13;
way. I use it only as an example of what happened with several of the proposals that were made at the&#13;
departmental level When they reached the m8Dagement lcve~ the Vic:c President and sometimes the&#13;
President, you had to revise the proposals for reasons which maybe were good. maybe were bad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: During the period 1950 to 1971, do you feel that the Personnel Division or Department had&#13;
just about the right amount of influence on personnel decisions in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Ye5, I do. Again, the larpr the Bauik greVI, and the more complex the rules, and the more&#13;
forms, and the more policies, the more diffieult it was for the Personnel DivisioD to have its own way&#13;
about how thing,1s were going to rua, and the more advice it got from outside itself. The line becomes&#13;
fuzzy as to where the influence came from: whether it came from the Personnel Division, whether it&#13;
came from the Director of the department, Vlhether it came from some outside group Vlho had a&#13;
grievance. But I think there arc two periods: the period prior to the creation and the ascendancy of&#13;
the Staff Association and the period subsequent to it. There's a division. there. But I think it was&#13;
worthwhile. I don't think the Staff Association was a bad thiug. I think it took a 'While for the&#13;
management to learn that they had to live with the Staff Aasociation. I think ia the early years of the&#13;
Staff Association they probably went too far too fast. ney tried to get the World Bankâ&#128;¢s world&#13;
changed too quickly. ney bad a series of good and bad leaders sitting in the Staff Association Chair.&#13;
as you probably had in the staff itself in the departments. But, if you take it all together, I think it "WaS&#13;
probably a useful thing. I remember being very annoyed at the Staff Association from my perspective&#13;
and wishing tbeyd go away. It was easier to run the department or division without a Staff Association.&#13;
But it was probably a good thing.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                           Â·15Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: As a fmal question, do you have any reflections on any key personalities or characters in&#13;
Personnel during those years who you think may have cast their identity on the division and the&#13;
institution?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: I would probably have to tbink a little bit about that. In fact, I can tell you a little&#13;
sidelight. I was working in the State Department as a personnel officer in the Office of Foreign&#13;
Service. I had a telephone call asking if I would like to come over to be interviewed for a position ill&#13;
the World Bank. I didn't even knowwba~ the World Bank was, I must admit But I said, sure. Being&#13;
an old personnel mau. myself, I knew you never turned down au. opportuoity to go and be interviewed&#13;
for au.other job that might be the key to an your success. So the inteni.cw was set up for   ~      o'clock,&#13;
and they told me where the building was. I was to go to the twelfth Door in the A building. At that&#13;
time the Fund and the Bank were both occupying the same top five, or six, or seven, or eight Doors of&#13;
the A building. And I arrived there at U."()(), and I went into this room. It was a very small room, au.d&#13;
it had an array of maybe tbree desks. On top of each desk was one of these big brown boxes with&#13;
toggle switches, which was the telephone system. Beside each toggle switch was a light which blinked&#13;
when the phone rang, and it kept blinking until you pulled the toggle switch and made the connec:tioo.&#13;
But there was nobody ia this room. It was 12:00 au.d I sat down and I waited. It got to be 12:15 and&#13;
nobody showed up. All of a sudden all of the lights on all of these boxes on all the desks lit up almost&#13;
at the same time.   The telephone bells were ringing and ringing. All of a sudden this door opened and&#13;
this fellow came sort of stumbling out. "Where in the hell are an the secretariesâ&#128;¢? That was Yann&#13;
LeRoux. He was, at that time, the only other professional male ia the Personnel Division, and he'd&#13;
obviously been having his siesta. So my introduction to the Bau.k was one of surprise because, first of&#13;
aU, there was no secretary in sight, the phones were not being manned, and the only person there had&#13;
been asleep. Yann was a hit of a character, and he eventually went to become the administrative&#13;
officer in the Paris Office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Does that cover Personnel?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: I think that takes us at least as far as your questions went on Personnel. Whea I look back&#13;
on my c::areer it's in two parts. Personnel was one and everthiDg else was the other. It was just about&#13;
midÂ·way of the 34 years. I spent tcn in the Personnel Division and then three in Teclmical Assistau.ce&#13;
and another one back ia Personnel and several as deputy director with Personnel under me, and then&#13;
the restÂ·Â·from 1971 onward--was all in Administrative Services. My career in Personnel really ended in&#13;
1971.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                             -16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: For about four years you worked in what was called the Technical Assistance and Planning&#13;
Department. Could you describe your role there?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Yes. Actually, when I joined it I tbiDk it was eaJled Techoical Assistance and PlanniDg&#13;
Staff. The Director was Richard H. Demuth, who was a lawyer by professicm, but he was one of the&#13;
most influential meo in the Bank in the period of time that he was in it. He was an innovator. He first&#13;
headed what was eal1ed a Staff Office, and if you look at the organization c:bart it was on a line with&#13;
what now would be Vice Presidents or ~ least department beads, but it DC\U bec:ame anything but a&#13;
Staff Office until later. I think it was probably between 1946 and 1948. I'm talking about an office that&#13;
had departmental rank. But he was always called an advisor to the President, or he had some titles&#13;
other tban Department Director, until the Development Services Department was formed in. 1961.&#13;
The Technical Assista.oce and Planning Staff, and later the Development Services. Department, was&#13;
very much a creation of Dick Demuth's. He bad the vision to know that the Bank's adivity was going&#13;
to be something other than just making loans to member c:ountries, that there was a whole area of need&#13;
in. the less developed c:ountries that had to be filled, and that the way to fill it was to provide technical&#13;
assistance. He also, I think, was given credit for c:onceptnalizing the IFC [International F'mance&#13;
Corporation] and also the EDI [Economic Development Institute]. So there 'Wel'e two large offshoots&#13;
of the Bank that Demuth was very much involved in during the early da)'S.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    When I joined t!1c Technic:al Assistance and Planning Staff my primary duty, with some others&#13;
including David Gordon, was to provide technical assistance and training to Bank and later IDA&#13;
[International Development Association] member c:ountries. Whenever we had a request whkh asked&#13;
for advice rather than moucy, it came to the Tedmieal Assistance and Planning Staff; at one time it&#13;
seems to me it may have been called Tecbuical Assistance and Liaison. I thiDk the reason I had been&#13;
selected by Demuth to move from Personnel to this Staff, was bea.use mw::h of the work of getting&#13;
consultants to take these tc&lt;:bnic:al assistance assignments was a recruiting function. You had to find&#13;
them. Although there was a technical assistance recruitment unit in the Personoel Department-and in&#13;
fad it was there &amp;om the time that we were recruiting for the Tcchnieal Bureau of the Plan&#13;
Organization-they were so busy hiring c:onsultants for Bank Resident Missions or Bank lending&#13;
missions that there was a gap. I think Demuth rcc:ognized that, in order to make a viable tcclmical&#13;
assistance and planning effort, we had to have help to recruit these technicians and c:onsultants. So that&#13;
was primarily my fund:iou.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                            Â·17Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
     When the Development Services Department was created, it really encompassed two units: the&#13;
Technical Assistance and Liaison Staff, or whatever it was c:alled, and the Development Advisory&#13;
Service. Demuth, I think, at that time also had EDI reporting to him up the line, and I think the&#13;
European Office reported to him. So he had a very sizable department when it finally achieved&#13;
departmentaJ status. My role in the Development Services Department was not unlike my role when it&#13;
was lh.r Technical Assistance and Planning Staff. It was to plan for technical assistance. I accompanied&#13;
Bank operational officers to Syria, to th.e Philippines, and to Iran at one time, to discuss with the&#13;
member countries what kind of technical assistance they were really looking for, how it related to terms&#13;
of reference of the Development Advisory Service, and then, after having that clarified, to help the&#13;
Personnel Division--it was still a division of the Administration Department in those times-reeruit the&#13;
necessary staff, and in some cases do the reeruitment ourselves. It was a broader respoosibility, as far&#13;
as I was concerned, than simply doing the personnel work: involved, bec:ause I was invited in the early&#13;
stages of planning to decide what the technical assistance ought to consist of. That was an enlargement&#13;
of responsibilities that I had had up to that time in the Bank:. But it was a logical extension of my&#13;
personnel work because the recruitment was very much a part of getting technical assistance to the&#13;
member countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Turning now to your years in ADM [Administrative Services Department], I would like first to&#13;
focus on the impact of some key figures. Could you discuss Mr. William Howell's role in the&#13;
development of the Administration Department, as it was then called.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'IWINING: Wen, let me first of all say that the man who was Director of Administration when I first&#13;
joined the Bank was a fellow called Chauncey Parker. I don't know if anybody else has talked to you&#13;
about Chauncey Parker, but Chauncey Parker had been a banker and good friend of Mr. [Eugene]&#13;
Black's. He joined Black early on in Black's career as President, and was named Director of&#13;
Administration. He'd been a member of a law firm which was the Washington firm Parker &amp;t Redpath,&#13;
and bad been, I lhinkt a former Marine Corps general, or certainly a coloneL Bill Howell was his&#13;
deputy. Subsequently, Chauncey Parker went to join Mr. [John J.] McCloy, a former Bank President,&#13;
in Germany, when McCloy was named High Commissioner. That left the Administration Department&#13;
position open, and Mr. Howell was appointed the Director. But when I first came Parker was still&#13;
here, and he remained for some time after I came.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                          -18-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
    Bill Howell played a very significant role in increasing the importance and the competence of the&#13;
Administration Department. He was a very laid-back kind of a fellow. who would listen to anybody&#13;
who wanted to speak to him. He was very easy to approach. He was a seasible man with a good&#13;
academic background, and a lot of experience in the Federal Govemment before he came to the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Let me go back and tell you about ~e Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at&#13;
Syracuse University. This was a school which was formed in about 1924 to train city managers. And&#13;
city managers, we learned, were very often called upon to run cities when there was a depression or&#13;
when thinss weren't going very well. But as soon as the cities had money, and had no problems of that&#13;
kind, they reverted quickly to the mayor and council form. of government. They weren't interested in&#13;
the city manager. The city manager was supposed to be a:n efficlenc:y expert. He knew how to get&#13;
things done with the least amount of money. But, by the time I got there, it was dear that Mr.&#13;
Roosevelt was increasing the size of the Federal Government by leaps and bounds. and it was pretty&#13;
dear to alm01t everybody that we were going to CVCDtually be in the war. So a city managership was no&#13;
longer coDSidered an avenue of employment for Maxwell School graduates. We used to ask the Dean&#13;
at Syracuse how we went about getting a job in Washington and there were several names sugested as&#13;
contacts. One was Bill Howell. At that time he was in the CMJ. Service CoiDIDi&amp;sion. So rd known&#13;
Bill Howell before I ever came to, or even heard of, the World Bank. He was very understanding. He&#13;
took the time to rmd out what was really behind the staff member's complaint, if it was a compJaint, or&#13;
to find out how he or the Department could help in any way. There weren't too many in the Bank in&#13;
those days who were like that; so he was unique. Hi&amp; ambition was to improve the caliber of the&#13;
Department, and yet he had inherited a fair number of people who had come over in m.any cases just&#13;
on loan. I think Eddie [Edward J.) Donovan might have come over on loan. Bill [William) McCorkle&#13;
certainly came over &amp;om the Treaswy Department on loan, and several others bad. Bill had this group&#13;
of people, not any one of which he wanted to fire, but he still wanted to get new people who would not&#13;
have the imago of American civil service, which so many of the earlier people almost inevitably bad,&#13;
because when the Bank was formed that's where they turned to get the initial staff. I think he did a&#13;
good job of this. He also improved the teclmiquca that we were using.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                            -19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING}&#13;
     The thing that he did best, I guess, for Administration was to improve the image of the&#13;
Department. For reasons that rm not sure I understand, administration departments generally have a&#13;
fairly low image, not in terms of the people and their capabilities, but in terms of their role. If you're&#13;
an operations man, or if you're an economist, or if you're even nowadays a computer expert. you have a&#13;
certain image and a certain place in any organization. But adrninistators--forgetting management as&#13;
administration, which it really is--have a tendency to be less glamorous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Bill was always in the forefront of those who were trying to upgrade not only the staff of the&#13;
department, but also it's image and the influence it bad on management. He was supported very much&#13;
in this by [Robert LJ Garner, who had been an administrator in lhe General Foods Corporation, and&#13;
by Black, who had always been a banker but who also recogoizcd what Bill was trying to do. I would&#13;
say that of all the people I worked for in lhe Bank, including those that I worked in:unediately under,&#13;
HowcU was by far the person I admired most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Unfortunately, as you know, he died suddenly at about age 56, but he was just a wonderful fellow.&#13;
He had a lot of common sense about him, and he was not afraid to admitlhat what be was suggesting&#13;
might not be found in a book, might not be in the pages of the Syracuse manual.. but it was the best way&#13;
to go. I can't say enough about Howell and his contribution to the Bank, and to me, and to everybody&#13;
eJse tbat his career touched. Don Fowler was a very good friend of Bill Howell. Don also was a&#13;
graduate of Syracuse and the MaxweU School. On the other side of the street Ken Clark, who&#13;
eventually became the Director of Administration, but at that time was head of Personnel of the Fund,&#13;
was also a Syracuse graduate, so there were a lot of Bill Howell's proteges floating around in these&#13;
international organizations at that rime.&#13;

&#13;
MUIR: How would you characterize the impact and influence Of the Vice Presidents who successively&#13;
had cbarge of ADM: Messrs. Garner, [Sir Geoffrey) Wilson, (Mohamed] Sboaib, {Bernard) Cbadeact,&#13;
aod [Martijn] Paijmans?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: I caD tell you what my views are. Well, there's one that you left our. He was not a Vice&#13;
President at the time but, [Aron] Broches, when he was General Counse~ was named to sit over the&#13;
administration complex. 1 knew Mr. Garner perhaps less weU than I've known the Vice Presidents&#13;
since his time, simply because I was lower on the totem pole at the time be was Vice President. I&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                           -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING)&#13;
know that bis influence Oll the Bank was very stroog. Mr. Black used Mr. Garner as his chief of staff.&#13;
Mr. Black held the title. and Mr. Black sat ill the chair at the Board, and Mr. Black made the important&#13;
decisioos, but Garner ran the Bank. You only went to Mr. Black when Mr. Gamer wanted you to, or&#13;
felt that this was something of great interest to Black and he should let Black deal with it. He had an&#13;
abiding illterest in administration. He was especially interested, I think, in personnel managem.eDt.&#13;
Whether this came from his experience ill General Foods or whether it was just what he saw in the&#13;
Bank when he joined--which was maybe. a year or so before I joined--I don't know. But he was most&#13;
interested.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I thillk I mentioned when we were talking about salary increases ill those da)'S. and how we went&#13;
about salary administration, that Gamer was a very busy man. Even though the Bank was only then&#13;
working its way up toward a thousand people, he was, in effect, doing everything that many Vtce&#13;
Presidents do today. And yet. he took the time, and bad a great illterest in, sitting down with two&#13;
people from Persormel. much below his level. and going over word for word the personnel evaluations&#13;
of the professional staff. He didn't touch the so-ealled non-professional staff at that time. But he&#13;
certainly bad an interest in it to that extent., and he knew so many of them by aame and by performance&#13;
that he could make a real contribution to deciding whether this man was ready for this much of an&#13;
increase or that much of an increase, or ought to stay where he was and he had very definite views&#13;
about the way the professional staff was behaving.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Did all staff know that he was doing this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Oh, yes. It was not a secret&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: So it bad an impact on their morale that he was involved in their careers?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Sure, right. I thiak they all respected him for it. even th.ough it took a lot of bis time, and I&#13;
think some of them felt that it was wrong because he couJdnâ&#128;¢t have known how well they did as much as&#13;
the department head knew. Nevertheless, they knew that he was doing this. This carried over then&#13;
when he became President of IFC. I remember well the first time we went to visit Garner, who then&#13;
had a presidential tag and not a vice presidential tag, to discuss salaries of IFC staff. many of whom&#13;
he'd recruited from the Bank staff and others he'd gone out and recruited independently. Suddenlyt&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                           -21-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
whereas he was fairly conservative in giving salary increases in the Bank, when we went to him with the&#13;
same procedure with IFC he was willing to go all out. These people were the best he'd ever seen.&#13;
They were all going to be making the 1FC the best organization going an~ in fatt, one day Lthink I&#13;
remember that Don'Fowler and I went to see Garner about IFC salaries and he was recommending&#13;
such big jumps, and we were getting more and more annoyed because he hadn't done that before. We&#13;
weren't even recommending these jumps. F'mally, he turned to us and he sai~ "You guys must think&#13;
I'm crazy." We said, "Yes, frankly, we do." But he still had that strong interest in the administration of&#13;
the staff under him.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The Vice President whom I knew least weD, and who had a relatively short Bank career, was&#13;
Geoffrey Wilson. I can't remember the precise dates but I think probably when Garner left to become&#13;
President of IFC, Black, or certainly Woods after him, began to aeate more positions for Vice&#13;
Presidents. That's when the switch took place. We got away from the single VJ.CC President, chief of&#13;
staff type of organization, and we bad a number of Vice Presidents created. Geoffrey Wilson, I think,&#13;
was brought in as a Vice President, but I'm not sure of that fact. Whether he came as a high level&#13;
person in operations fll'St or not, l don't remember. He had a relatively short Bank career. He&#13;
expressed a lot of interest in Admin., espec:ially during the period after Bill Howell died. Mike'Lejeune&#13;
was named to succeed Bill Howell and Raymond J. Goodman, who had been the deputy under Howell&#13;
at the time of his dec.tb, was still deputy under Lejeune. At that time Wt.lson seemed to have a lot of&#13;
interest. He was a good friend of Ray Goodman's and they worked together weD, and be could speak&#13;
to him, I think, even better than he had been able to speak to Bill Howell. But when Ray Goodman&#13;
was not appointed Director of Administration after Bill's death--and I don't know the ins and outs of&#13;
why he wasn't-1 think Ray was disappointed and asked to be let go back to operatioos, from whence&#13;
he'd come. I don't remember whether he became a Director of a department, or an assistant director&#13;
of an operational department. I think maybe he worked for Peter Cargill as an assistant director.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    When Lejeune, who had taken over for Howell, asked me to take over for Ray Goodman,&#13;
Geoffrey W'dson's interest in the department was already on the wane. While we worked with him very&#13;
much the way owe had worked with Gamer, in the sense that we put out the same kind of proposals and&#13;
so forth, be didn't have the strong interest in it that Garner had. In fact. I remember Wilson at the&#13;
time I became Deputy Director of Administration as being quite critical of Administration. Of course,&#13;
then I got to know him more because I was closet' to that level and when Lejeune was away I was&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                             -22-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
running the Department. IDStead of being rather supportive, as Bill Howell had been. he tended to&#13;
criticize us for things we didn't do the way be thought they should be done. Or if someone outside of&#13;
the administrative heirarchy was critical, Wilson was very often supportive of that criticism. This made&#13;
it a little difficult to work under him .. I don't remember the dates but I do recall that it was a fairly&#13;
short time that Wilson was in charge of Administration. Again. I didn't go back to research this, but it&#13;
seems to me that there was a b.iatus between the time of Wilson's departure and the time that Broches&#13;
was named, as a subsidiary duty of General Counsel, to oversee the Administration Department.&#13;
During that hiatus, Lejeune and I reported directly to President Woods. There was a string of some&#13;
Vice Presidents to which department heads reported, I!Dd far over on the right-band side of the&#13;
organization chart were two departments, Administration and Program Evaluation and Contro~&#13;
reporting directly to the President.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then the next person to whom we reported was RoDDie Broches. He was General Counsel and&#13;
not a Vice President at that time. Woods was the one who decided that Admin. should report through&#13;
Broches, and I thio.k he may have said, at the time that he assigned us to do that, that it was an interim&#13;
measure. He didn't have the time to spend dealing with these matters. I think at that point the budget&#13;
people, John Williams perhaps--I think it was Williams then. or [John H.] Adler, I don't remember&#13;
exactly--reported up through another channe~ through the accounting side. We reported to Broches.&#13;
Brocbes served in this role for a couple of years, bow many I'm not sure. He was a lawyer. He really&#13;
had no great interest in administration. I think he thought it was a burden that someone had put on his&#13;
shoulders to take on this role. However, he had a great interest in architecture, and in the course of his&#13;
supervising us we compJeted the D building. In fact, we began and finished the D building and we also&#13;
built the Paris Office building during the time we reported to Brochcs. So he had two buildinBs to sort&#13;
of play with, while supervising Administration. For part of that time Lejeune com.inued to be the&#13;
Director. Then, while Broches was still sitting over us, Hugh Ripman was nominated by Woods to&#13;
succeed Lejeune, and I remained Deputy Director.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I remember Ronnie wanting to go to Italy with the architects to select. the marble that was going to&#13;
go on the facade of the D building, and they took several trips to a quarry outside of Rome. They&#13;
inspected the marble, and they were shown how they were quarrying it and how it would be cut and&#13;
how it would be numbered. Then. when we were doing the Paris building. we bad a French architect,&#13;
and Ronnie took many a trip to Paris to see how it was going and made some sUf&amp;CStions about how it&#13;
should took.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                            Â·23-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(TWINING]&#13;
    This was a very diffieult building, as you may know. Washington has terribly strict height and&#13;
architectural limitations because of it being a capital city, and they don't want it to be too different. But&#13;
Paris is far worse. There you could hardly touch a stone without getting, as far as I know, the whole&#13;
National Assembly to approve it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Hugh Ripman also enjoyed the job of "supervising" the construction of the Paris building and he&#13;
used to visit once a week. He'd get on. the plane Thursday night and spend aD day Friday in Paris, and&#13;
he'd get on a plane Saturday night and come home. This went on for months while that building was&#13;
being built. I think I took one or two trips when Ripman was busy doing something else and he sent&#13;
me in his place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But I would characteri%e Ronnie Broches as having a general interest in administration. not a very&#13;
specific one. He enjoyed the building program that we were embarked on. had very many ideas about&#13;
how it ought to look and how it ought to be divided up, and he was delighted to have the Paris Office&#13;
come up while he was in that role. But I think he was also delighted when he was relieved of the&#13;
responsibility for supervising Administration, which he was whea Mr. McNamara eame.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    After Broches, there was [Mohamed] Shoaib â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   IAJiJ.J,Jt~IJ. &amp;e"''"''~~" f&#13;
    ELP          ,.., 6 . " 'lÂ·~l&#13;

                                                                                           . Foralong&#13;
while be was just Vice PresidentÂ·-it wasn't stated what he did--and then, suddenly, McNamara bad the&#13;
idea that we should report directly to Shoalb. There was also a hiatus between Broches' being relieved&#13;
of that job and Shoaib taking it on, and then we reported directly to McNamara. But McNamara was&#13;
far too busy raising money and parcelling it out and increasing the staff, and increasing the member&#13;
country missions and increasing lending to worry about Administration. Shoaib was not a professional&#13;
public administrator. although I suppose as F'mance Minister he must have had a fairly large cadre of&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
people to be responsible for and to administer in some fashion. It was during Shoaib's tenure in charge&#13;
of Administration that the decision was taken to divide Administration into three parts: Administrative&#13;
Services, Personnel, and Organization and PlamUng. He continued to have the three Department&#13;
Directors report to him for a short while after that decision was taken.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Do you know who made that decision?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: McNamara. As far as I know, it was not even recommended to him by anybody. Shoaib&#13;
might have been consulted and might have said this is the best way to go, but my recollection of it was&#13;
that McNamara, who was making quite a number of organiutional changes at that time, deci.ded that&#13;
the Administration Department had just gotten much too large, that it was too big for any one or two&#13;
people to handle. Anyway, Mc:Namara bad certam clements of adminiwation that he was interested in&#13;
and others that he wasn't. I think he wanted personnel to be separate because that was one thing that&#13;
he had an interest in. Shortly after that split, Bernard Chadenet succeeded Shoaib. In fact, it probably&#13;
happened when Shoaib retired. It just seems to me there might have been a period when Shoaib stayed&#13;
on--whether in a special capacity or not, I don't know-"after Chadenet took over.   rm sure Shoaib was&#13;
already over the retirement age by that time. I think McNamara bad kept him on even though he was&#13;
at mandatory retirement age. But he didn't stay long after Chadenet took over.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Cbadenet was an engineer by training. We didn't seem to find any more trained administrators&#13;
after Garner. We had a lawyer, and we had a F'mance Miuister. I doDâ&#128;¢t know what Geoffrey Wilson&#13;
was in the U.K. civil service. In fact, Chadenet had headed the Technical Operations Department&#13;
before he bctame Vice Pre&amp;ident in charge of Administration. Aldcwereld had been promoted to Vtce&#13;
President over thls whole complex and Chadenet and [Wanen C.] Baum were numing the Technical&#13;
OpcratioDS Department under him. He was very interested in administration. and he worked hard at&#13;
it. He was amious to have recommcndarloDS made to him about what should and shouldn't be done.&#13;
He listened to these rccommcmdatioos very carefully. He may or may not have sought outside advice.&#13;
I suspec:t in many cases be did. By that I mean he discussed it with Mc:Namara. or discussed it with&#13;
some of his other senior colleagues before he gave us his blessing or not on things we proposed. He&#13;
was a very benevolent. kind man who would listen to you, and even though he disagreed with what you&#13;
were recommend.i.D&amp; he would give you plenty of time to try to persuade him.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                           -25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
     This was a new organizational structure that Cbadenet was running. Shoaib didn"t run it long&#13;
enough to make it run smoothly or make changes. The single Administration Department which&#13;
included such things as pla.tming and organization computing. and so forth. was one thing and then&#13;
suddenly he bad three, and he had three department heads UDder him, so it was different. Mr.&#13;
Chadenet's troubles, if he had troubles, began again with the creation and the increasing influence of&#13;
the Staff Association. He had a series of Staff Association Chairmen who, in the bcginrring, were very&#13;
good. I think Jim Cbaffey was one of the early ones, perhaps the first, and Beogt Sandberg was&#13;
another one. Then he had one or two who were not so good ia. the sense of taking a reasonable&#13;
approach to getting this thing to work. Bernard, I'm sure,. lost many a night's sleep over meetings that&#13;
we had with the Staff Association, partly because he knew that this was something that was encouraged,&#13;
and whose time had come. Almost all of the early, quote, "problems" that the Staff Association&#13;
addressed to management were addressed to the admin.istrat.We side of the Bank, whether it was the&#13;
travel policy or fair treatment in salaries, or job classifications, or space and why they moved so much.&#13;
All of these were issues that the Staff Association initially put on the table, which we were dealing with&#13;
anyway, theoretically, but which they wanted input to. And, of course, here was Bernard, for the fnt&#13;
time running all these departments and he had to take on the confrontation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Bernard certainly gave it his all, and he was an easy person to work with, and he tried his best to&#13;
be fait to all sides. Perhaps he tried too bard. The Staff Association, I thini; went away from many&#13;
meetings thinking that this man was weak, because he wouldn't poUDd the table and say, "No, we're not&#13;
going to do it that way, no matter what you do. Go on strike, or whatever you're threateaing to do."&#13;
He tried negotiation. But sometimes that didn't work, and he still wouldn't be very fmn about it. So&#13;
the Staff Association would leave a meeting thinking he said yes, and in fact be said possibly, maybe,&#13;
and he meant no. That type of negotiation doesn't make anybody feel very good. But I enjoyed&#13;
working with Bernard. I think that he had a lot to offer the Bank. Maybe he was not the best choice to&#13;
be head of this complex, but 1 don't know what McNamara's choices were, so I can't say tbat he might&#13;
have foUDd a better one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Paijmans, I would just as soon not comment on. I'll leave it to others to characterize his&#13;
contribution to the Bank. Maybe it's too soon for me to tell you what I think of Paijmans. and maybe I&#13;
don't know what I think of him until I see how some of his plans tum out.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                            Â·26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Maybe you would comment on the fact that, if I remember correctly, Bernard Chadenet had&#13;
no, or very few, assistants. wbereu Martijn Paijmans has a rather large cadre. How do you&#13;
characterize that change. Is that a style question, do you think. or a need?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Well, I'm sure it's a style, but I'm also sure Mr. Paijmans feels it to be a need. Bernard&#13;
Chadenet had a great deal of confidence, or gave the appearance of having a great deal of confidence,&#13;
in his Department Directors. He would rely on the Direc:tors to do the necessary staff work; or have&#13;
their staff do the necessary work; and ~e would listen patiently to the proposals he received, aod&#13;
between the Director and himself they would resolve these issues. Paijmans has very definite views&#13;
about how everything is going to be done. But, in order to be sure that he bas the necessary&#13;
knowledge, he has to surround himself with a large number of people, each of whom bas a little role to&#13;
play, whether it's a man who's going to keep his eye on administration, and a man who's going to keep&#13;
his eye on personnel. and a man who's goio&amp; to keep his eye on computing. and another one who's&#13;
going to be keeping his eye on planning, So Martijn found it desirable to have Tony [Antony P.] Cole&#13;
as his chief of staff, or whatever he was. He had someone on the staff morale side, a succession of&#13;
them in fact. I think they were all psychologists, I'm not sure. Plus, he relied on his lower level staff to&#13;
be his eyes and ears as well. This, I think, speaking personally, gives one the feeling that he didn't trust&#13;
his department heads, that unless he originated the idea, or ualess the people he hired to do these&#13;
various tasks told him this was the way it should be, it wasn't a good way. But, as I say, I think it's early&#13;
times for me to be e&gt;'aluating Paijmans, although I served under him for quite a while. When I was&#13;
made a Director of a department, and [Reginald A.] Clarke was made a Director of a department, I&#13;
hired Algie [D. A.] de Silva to be my deputy, and Reg Clarke hired Martijn Paijmans to be his deputy.&#13;
SuddeDly not many years later the two of us were reporting to Martijn Paijmans as a Vice President.&#13;
That was hard to adjust to, but, anyway. I think I'll skip any more about Paijmans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: You made a reference to Presidents Woods and McNamara. Do you have any other thoughts&#13;
on their impact or relationships with ADM?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: WeD, I don't thiak Woods had a great impact on ADM, although we dealt with him very&#13;
much. Woods bad a tendency to be both friendly and helpful. but also antagonistic. I remember well&#13;
that we'd go to a Board meeting. I would go with Mike Lejeune. I was Deputy Director and Mike was&#13;
Director. I would have agreed with Lejeune on a position, and Woods would have agreed that it was&#13;
the right position, and the paper would be written accordingly. Mike would read from or quote from&#13;
&amp;#12;1WIN1NG                                            -2:1-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
J:TWINING]&#13;
the paper in the Board meeting. and say we propose to do the following, and p         all the reasons. If no&#13;
Board member raised his hand and began to argue with us, Woods would. Not only would he do that&#13;
to get us in a defensive mood, but then he'd try to get me to say that I didn't agree with what Mike said.&#13;
This was a teclmique. He didn't mean to undercut us. or make us look silly. But it was a technique he&#13;
used, I think, to show the Board that he as the President, was right on top of this situation and he&#13;
suspected that there were some thing$ that maybe we weren't teDing the Board, and by God he was&#13;
going to rm.d them. out. And he was going to fmd them out right there at the table and the Board could&#13;
chime in and, of course, the Board did. F'U"St thing you know, the Board members would say, "That's&#13;
sort of crazy. Why are you going to go that way? What are you going to do this for?â&#128;¢ Then Woods&#13;
rmaUy would back off and say, "No, no, no, that's fine. I think thq're just right." But, in the meantime,&#13;
weâ&#128;¢re both sitting there with egg all over our faces, and Woods was enjoying it. It took a whlle to get&#13;
used to this form of leadership. I think both Mike and I had times when we thought this man was&#13;
really sticking the shiv in and turning it, and we were squirming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     McNamara, on the other band, was., as you probably know, very inci&amp;ivc. He knew more about&#13;
what was in a paper you'd put up to him, at the time you went up to defend it, than you knew about it.&#13;
He was a voracious reader, and he always got to the bottom line very quickly, and be would tell you, in&#13;
no uncertain terms. McNamara used an entirely diffCTent philosophy. We went to the Board&#13;
occasionally, several times, on this GW {George Washington University] property. It was a&#13;
complicated arrangement. The University was going to seU us the land and then we were goiDg to&#13;
build a building and they were going to buy the land back in 40 years, and they were going to get the&#13;
building at a fvccd pric:e in today's dollars. On the face of it, UDless you go through the exercise of&#13;
present values, which we did to come up with this proposal, it looks a 6ttle stupid. Youâ&#128;¢re going to,&#13;
quote, "give away" a building which is only 40 years old, and has certainly not outlived its usefulness. for&#13;
the same price as back in the late seventies or eighties when we finished building it. By that time that&#13;
building is going to be worth, on paper anyway, maybe five times what it's worth when first completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Once McNamara bad been convinced, or maybe even contributed to deciding bow to go, then he&#13;
backed you up all the way. There was none of this games playjng like Woods did at the Board.&#13;
McNamara would not only be very supportive, but if he sensed that a Director was trying to make&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                            -28-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[1WINING)&#13;
a staff member squirmÂ·-whether it was administration or an operational staff member on a proposed&#13;
loan--McNamara would answer the question himself. He wouldn't make the staff member either&#13;
reveal his ignorance or stumble around trying to get the right answer. lo. that way he was very&#13;
supportive. Once youâ&#128;¢d c:onvinced him that that was the way to go. he was going to get it through the&#13;
Board, come hell or high water. And he did. He put down a lot of Executive Directors who had very&#13;
legitimate concerns about what we were doing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The same thing was true earlier when we were going to buy the Fund bulld.ing. We had to&#13;
negotiate with the Fund, and it was a difficult negotiation because the Fund had a view of a autle that&#13;
they were abandoning. and they knew how much their new building was going to cost. McNamara had&#13;
certain views about that building. I tbink in your notes you refer to his concerns. But all these things,&#13;
when they got to the Board under McNamara, were very well handled indeed. He would not&#13;
embarrass you in. front of the Board, nor would he bile you in. the back.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: But was he easy to convince in. the first place?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: No. You had to have a lot of facts. Somebody once said that McNamara had a computer&#13;
for a mind, and be kept saying he didDâ&#128;¢t like computers. Heâ&#128;¢d rather do it on the back of an envelope,&#13;
and heâ&#128;¢d do it fast. I enjoyed watching Mr. McNamara at work--although it was a time of some&#13;
concern that we were going to be made to look foolish, or that he was not going to agree with us in the&#13;
end--more than I enjoyed watching others above me work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Were we generally sueccssful in. getting our point across to McNamara, and getting his&#13;
support?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1WINING: Yes, I think so, at least on the Administrative Services side we were. Personnel had a&#13;
slightly more difficult problem, partly because McNamara felt a little more UDa)mfortable with the&#13;
Board about personnel matt~ where a lot of money was at stake. Every two percent increase&#13;
represents a huge sum of money to the staff and working hours, and vacation time, and pensions.&#13;
These are big numbers. It's a lot of money to run the Administration Department too, but relatively&#13;
speaking it's less because you're dealing with one particular projeet which is going to cost X and is not&#13;
going to escalate year after year after year. In Personnel if you give a four perc::ent increase today and&#13;
you keep on going like that you're going to have a payroll of significant size in five years time. So I&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
thlnk he was less sure of himself there, although be had very definite views a.s to what was right and&#13;
what was wrong. He also bad, I think, iD the very besiDniog some antagonistic feeling about the Staff&#13;
Association, which iDcreased iD size and influence during his career. In the end. be supported&#13;
everything that was rmally agreed. but in the beginning he would have preferred that the Staff&#13;
Association hadn't existed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Because he was very interest~ in the dollar bottom line, did this affect allocation of resources&#13;
to ADM severely?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Not really. I'm sure we didn't get the same percentage of the budget, in terms of the&#13;
number of people we bad in the department or iD terms of the number of projects we were operating,&#13;
a.s other non-operational departments got. I think we did better than the Secretary's Department and&#13;
better than the Information and Public Affairs Department. Personnel probably got a better shake&#13;
from McNamara, in terms of the money that was allocated. than we did. However, 'there was no&#13;
project that we proposed to do, or any continuing work that we had to do--in the maintenance of&#13;
buildings, or the building of new buil~, or the communications operation, or records. or language&#13;
services, or anything else--that he picked out and said. "No you can't have that much money for that&#13;
operation: He gave us less mooey a.s a department than maybe we asked for, and left it to us to&#13;
allocate it however we wanted. By us, I mean either Chadenet or, later, Paijmans. That was only his&#13;
view of which departmental function was more important. If you bad a pic that was so big you divided&#13;
it up and tried to give it to those who needed it most in your judgement. But I never felt that we were&#13;
squeezed to the poiDt where we couldn't do basically what we had set out to do.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: What do you see as some of the highlights in the evolution of ADM during your period as&#13;
Director?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING~     WeD, I don't know if highlights is the right word. If by highlights you mean major events&#13;
that occurred during my directorship, I can identify them. I was promoted to Department Director in&#13;
September'l971. That December I was sitting at my desk just toward the end of the year and I began&#13;
jotting down the things that I thought the Administrative Services Department had to do iD the&#13;
following year. I think I headed it Problems as 1m Dawm;. or somethi.Dg. These were things that&#13;
were on my mind, and I'd go home and 1 huldn't go to sleep some nights because of them. And I kept&#13;
that up. I kept it just underneath my blotter in my office. So I have a series of these things going back&#13;
&amp;#12;lWINING                                            Â·30-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
to 1971 and finishing in 1983. There were two thiogs that started in 1971 and, when I looked the ather&#13;
day, were still there in 1982. One was space and the other was travel. Those were the two things that l&#13;
think our department was respon&amp;ibJe for that gave us, a.s a department, the most trouble for more than&#13;
a decade. So I think those are two major events.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     F'mt, the difficulty in making a decision about when we had to rent more spac:c, how many people&#13;
we bad to move into that space, why~ took space here and not there, and what kind of a deal we&#13;
could make on the space. When we decided to go after the GW property, we went tbroup difficult&#13;
negotiations for it, and delays occurred because we had to go through five or six different CODIDli$sions&#13;
in the District to get approval. Then there was the Doa't Tear It Down group, and the Neighborhood&#13;
Adivsory Committee, all these people who fought us from the very beginning, and who didn't want a&#13;
building where this one stands on the George Washington GW University campus. That made us then&#13;
decide to buy the property where the l building is, because we could build a building there quickly,&#13;
while we were still negotiating for the GW property on 19th Street. All of those things were, as I say,&#13;
with us in 1971 and they're still with us. Now they're busy building another building for 1985 or 1986 or&#13;
whenever it'll be finished. And I'm sure that won't end it. I guess Bill [William J.] Cosgrove, if be&#13;
keeps such a &amp;1:, will keep it on his list too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The other is the blessed travel policy. The history of that I won't try to go through. but, as you&#13;
know, in the very beginning we had American Express, and then Woods came along and he said get rid&#13;
of American Express: "All they do .is make a commission on every fligbt we take. We'll run it&#13;
ourselves". We got to the point where we thought American Express was not giving us the best senic:e,&#13;
and we thought that, although they weren't getting anytbjng from us, they were getting a big slug from&#13;
the airlines. So the contract expired with American &amp;press, over their screams ud squeals, and they&#13;
left ud we undertook to hire people to run our own Travel Office. That was fine during Woods'&#13;
period, when tbc Bank bad about 1,200 staff members. We went Â£rom 5.56 to about 1,263. So when&#13;
Woods was here we were fairly stable at around twelve hundred, I believe. We were running the&#13;
Travel Oftic:e ourselves, doin,g all of the bookings and making all of the reservations and deciding what&#13;
staff could and couldn't do in making their travel arrangements. In those days first class was pretty&#13;
prevalent, until Woods decided we couldn't afford that anymore because of the image impact on IDA&#13;
replenishment and a few other things. It was a very traumatic experience and it probably wasn't the&#13;
right decision. In any case, as yo~ also know, we eventually weDt back to American Express and the&#13;
travel policy was amended to permit some first class travel on long distance flights.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                             -31-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
     However, we always thought American Express ought to be able to do better, and I gather they're&#13;
still negotiating a contract. They put it out for bid I believe, but settled again on American Express.&#13;
I'm not sure of the bidding. They're still try.iog to get American Express to computerize the whole&#13;
operation. American Express has done more than we expected them to be able to do, I guess. But that&#13;
was number two. I think travel probably ran second to space as being the biggest headache, or major&#13;
even~     in my tenure as Director.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     There were others, but these were almost at the top of the list every year. But some would come&#13;
on and then they'd drop off and then they'd reappear again. The whole document control problem&#13;
must have started in 1973. It was a question of how to get a handle on controlling the documents in the&#13;
World Bank, and a study of this was undertaken. We called in an outside ~ and that stayed on my&#13;
list for quite a while, so I would guess that could be considered as one of the important major events. I&#13;
think we've got a handle on it now. Anyway, it's firmly in place. Whether it's the best that it could be is&#13;
another question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Another one that had been a constant bother was food senic:es. There was the issue of whether&#13;
Marriott should run our food services or whether we should put that out to bid, which we evenually did&#13;
just before I retired. Then they decided after I had left that they were going to keep Marriott on. But&#13;
the quality of food services, the sub&amp;idy of food services, the leDgt.h of the Jines in the cafeteria, the&#13;
cleanliness of the cafeteria, and why people got fed so well in the dining room. were issues that&#13;
constantly kept coming to the surface. With the Staff Association these problems were magnified. You&#13;
got to the point where you began to think that what we ought to do is put out a notice saying anybody&#13;
who doesn't like the Bank's food service is joUy well invited to go outside. There arc restaurants all&#13;
over the place. "Ob, no," was the reply. "It's the quality of life. You have to provide these services.&#13;
You don't want us spending our time going to restaurants."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Another reaming problem was security. When I joined the Bank anybody could walk in off the&#13;
&amp;treet.   You didn't have to show anytbi.ng. You might or might not work in the Balik, but you could&#13;
come right in the building. Then, as the tightening up process begaD, a1l you bad to do was wave a pass&#13;
and the guard would look at it. It could be the Safeway shopping card, or it could be your American&#13;
Express card, anything, and he'd wave you in. Then, of course, we got to the point where we narrowed&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                          -32-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
the opeuiDg where the guard could actually see the card. Now I guess they're still coDSideriog the&#13;
possibility of turnstiles or some other method of controlling access. As we told you this morning, I&#13;
drove in the garage. the man banded me the slip that Charles [Ziegler] had called about, and to an&#13;
extent l suppose that was security. But I could have been carrying a bomb in my car. and I could have&#13;
been coming in with someone other than Hector Prud'homme. who wanted to take out a typewriter if&#13;
we got near one. So I guess you have to put security down as another major event during my tenure. It&#13;
went from practically zero to what we have today. And it's probably going to go further.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The other major event I guess would have to be printing, because that is something that has&#13;
escalated to the point where you can't walk in a corridor anymore without stumbling over what the&#13;
Print Shop has produced. Every couple years we put in a new and bisger printing press. We managed&#13;
to keep the staff at a constant level. We didn't increase the staff, but every time we turned around we&#13;
had to spend another fifty to one hundred thousand doUars for a new machine, and the new machine&#13;
was to avoid having to hire two more people. Then we decided we should move the whole printing&#13;
operation out to Springfield, Vuginia. Great cries of anguish went up. AU those who lived in Maryland&#13;
said they would never get to work, and those who Jived in V~rginia were delighted. It went on and on&#13;
for a loog time. I don't know the latest, but now they've dropped that idea. Now the exercise is let's&#13;
see how much we can farm out. Reagan philosophy. take it away from government and give it back to&#13;
private industry. Take it away from the Bank's doing it, set a dollar amount and contract it out. We'll&#13;
see what comes of that. I think that probably has to be on the Jist as another major event.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then there are two more. One I would say is word processing We started word processing in my&#13;
department at the time it was first introduced. We had the vr/Sf. I think we were the first ones in&#13;
WashiDgton to have an MT/ST operation of the size we had, and it was a wonderful ac::hicvement. All&#13;
the loan officers ancl the people in operations were delighted that they could send this stuff down and&#13;
get it back the next morning. This was loog before computerized reproduction, but it was a start.&#13;
Eventually, we surrendered worcl processing to OPD (Organization Planning Department], and&#13;
probably correctly so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    F'mally, there was the whole concept of service standards, some of which you are probably&#13;
suffering with oow. We decided that the staff had an increasing demand level. If you gave them&#13;
something overnight they wanted it in six hours .instead of twelve hours. If you g~ve them five copies&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[1WININGJ&#13;
they wanted ten. That applies to all of the services we provide, whether it"s cleaning the floors or&#13;
providing documents. We began to work out a system--I guess Bill [Cosgrove] is still trying-of service&#13;
standards and some controls so that, not only will the staff know wbat to expea, but the budget people&#13;
will know what theyre going to have to pay if the Administrative Services Department is going to&#13;
provide service at a certain standard. So., I would guess you could add that as a major event.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Would you say, therefore, that those were the items you most frequently had on your agenda&#13;
for your meetings with your superiors?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Almost always, yes. They were certainly the items that were on the list in the beginning of&#13;
the year. In many cases during the course of the year they'd drop off because we dealt with them.&#13;
We'd decide, okay, Marriott's going to stay, and we're gojog to give them this much more leeway in&#13;
how they provide the food, or what food, or the size of the portions, or whatever. We'd reach an&#13;
accommodatioll. Then the next year it would be back on again because, in the meantime, some other&#13;
change bad occurred. We'd opened a new dining room, or we'd opened a new cafeteria, and there&#13;
were squeals from the staff because it was overcrowded. I remember when the I building was opened,&#13;
and we put the cafeteria on the fl.rst floor overlooking I Street. It was supposed to be the latest in--I&#13;
don't know what they called it--the split line. You could go here and get a sandwich. and you went&#13;
there if you wanted to get the full meal. Well, then people would go one place and they decided they&#13;
didn't like the looks of the sandwiches, so they wanted to cut into the other line. In the meantime, that&#13;
line went out to the elevators. You think you have the thing under control, and you take it off your list&#13;
and the next thing you know it's right back on again because of a new development that you really&#13;
hadn't foreseen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Were you in the unfortunate position of having to deal with all these details, because&#13;
frequently the complaints were at your level?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Well, more often than not, they were on my list because I knew that these were divisional&#13;
problems that were being dealt with and I was going to have to eventually make some kind of a&#13;
decision. Some were pressures from above being put on my shoulders. and I knew Pd bave to pass&#13;
them down. But most of them were there, and had been there, as I say, since 1971. They're just part of&#13;
the game for Administrative Services administrators. You expect them. But that's not listing all of the&#13;
things that flow gendy along with very little crisis.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                            -34-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(TWINING]&#13;
    Building maintenance was always a bis problem. No matter which VJC:e President we worked&#13;
under, we'd. get a call or a snowflake [a nnmbered note from Martijn Paijma:as, Vice Pre8ident for&#13;
Personnel and Administration] or something saying there were five cigarettes on the floor of the&#13;
balcony in the A building, and "why didn't we keep this place clean?â&#128;¢ I don't c:ousidcr that a major&#13;
event But those things. also had to be dealt with. Creation of the Rcc:ords Center Annex at National&#13;
Underground Storage, decidiug to put our documents in Pennsylvania. was an important decision, but&#13;
it's worked very well. It hasn't been a problem. It's not a major event in the seuse that major events&#13;
are prob1ems. That's the only distinction I'm making.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: What were some of the major organizational changes and departmental spin-offs duriag this&#13;
period, and c.ouJd you describe the effects of the 1972 reorganization on ADM?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: That reorganization was studied at a time when Mr. Shoaib was Vice President and had&#13;
been delegated by Mr. McNamara to Jook at the organi781ion of the Bimk. I'm sure Mr. McNamara&#13;
had given Mr. Shoaib some Sf18Bestions of his own as to how he thought the Bank ought to be&#13;
organized. Shoaib approached this by having a committee formed. of which I was a member. Then we&#13;
engaged the firm of Mc:Ki:bsey &amp; Company to make the study, or to be the leaders in studying the&#13;
present organization and making c:hangcs. So I was involved, as a member, in each of the decisions&#13;
that had to come to the committee, generally from the consultants. Then papers were prepared which&#13;
were floated around the Bank to the various departments that were affected and eventually, I'm sure,&#13;
Mr. ShoaJb discussed them informally with Mr. McNamara before they were formalized into a&#13;
recommendation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    As far as Admin. is concerned. 'Undoubtedly the major effect was in space planning. It was a very&#13;
difficult time for us in the sense that, if you were going to merge or consolidate UDits into a regional&#13;
structure -which is basically what the reorganization of 1m did-it was clear that you had to have&#13;
these units located either adjacent to one another, or close enough so that you weren't making it&#13;
difficult for the organization to work. That required us to look very carefully not only at what our&#13;
space situation was at the time it happened, but what it should be quite a way down the road, because&#13;
we weren't sure-I wasn't anyway-of what the growth pattern would be in the new organization. It's&#13;
one thing to say you're going to have four regions instead of two, or you're going to have four regions&#13;
instead of a functional office, department, bureau, whatever. It's another to say that if you continued in&#13;
the .functional mode the growth would be X, but if you split into a regional mode the growth would&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                             -35-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
be Y because you lost the advantages of numbers. You had to have a little bit of each in all the regions&#13;
instead of a whole lot of one in one department. So, because of that, the question of space became&#13;
much more complicated for us than it might have been. We thought we would be able to provide&#13;
enough adjacent space to fulfill the obvious requirements of the reorganization. What we didn't know&#13;
was how much spare space we had to provide, and should provide at the time you made the move, and&#13;
what that would mean to our total space allocation. I think probably we made some misc:ak:ulations.&#13;
We ended up giving too little space to the Asia region and too much space to the Middle East, or&#13;
whatever. Perhaps this division which previously didn't exist, or this department that previously didn't&#13;
exist wasn't in the right place vis-aÂ· vis another department that didn't exist. That's the major thing.&#13;
AJso, there was an increase in demand for services that came out of this reorganization. Again, the loss&#13;
of the advantages of size made for inaeased demands throughout the organization. You'd think that if&#13;
you had a pie and you broke it up into five parts., the sum of the parts would still equal the whole, but&#13;
it's not true. If you break it up into five parts, the demands on our servic::es for each of the five are&#13;
greater than the demands used to be for the whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The other thing that affected us was the increase in field missions. I don't mean missions to the&#13;
field to make a loan, but creation of resident missions. That had an effec:t on documents, on&#13;
procurement, and on traveL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Finally, I guess the other major effec:t was on document contro~ on how you had to reclassify, or&#13;
redesign all the documents that previously had becD in Tedmical Operations and Lending. Suddenly it&#13;
wasn't Technical Operations and Lendiog anymore. It was region X and region Y and a little bit of&#13;
this, and a little bit of that. And the Education Division was aJ1 dispersed into the regions, and the&#13;
engineers were alJ dispersed in the regions, and the doaunents that you knew they were going to need&#13;
weren't in that fashion. You had to redesign the whole thing. So I think those were the four major&#13;
effects on Admin. of the reorganization of 1972.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: And spin-off's, were they purely a function of the increase in size of the Bank and the&#13;
Department?&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                          -36-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Yes, I think they were. There were a number of organizational chaoges which are best&#13;
described in Bogomir Chokel's [Archivist of the World Bank] organization chart of the Bank. In fact,&#13;
I'm sure Bogomir researched this very carefully, and this is the way it looked in 1m. But I remember&#13;
that in the Administration Department of Bill Howell's day, Francis Poore had the title of Deputy&#13;
Director and Controller, or Assistant DirectorÂ·Â·! forget. So the Controller function was in the&#13;
Administration Department at one time, and this chart doesn't reflect that. 1'his chart shows the&#13;
Controller Bowing from the Treasurer's Department. There may have been some people in the&#13;
Treasurer's Department who were performing a controllership function, but the Controller was Francis&#13;
R. Poore, and he was deputy to Howell and in Administration. We also had, at that time, a fellow         t&#13;
called [Arnold) Johnston, who was hired to be the budget officer. I'm sorry. We bad a fellow before&#13;
that by the name of Arnold Kirch, who was the budget officer, and be was in Administration. So if you&#13;
go that far back. they were not department head level so tbars why they're not on Bogomir's chart.&#13;
But, in fad, from the old Administration Department of 1947, in additioD to ewrythiDg you see here,&#13;
there was Program Evaluation and Control. or Budget, and there was the Controller functiou, in&#13;
addition to Admin. Scrrices, PersoDDel, Organization and Pl.anDiDg. I guess that's it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The spinÂ·offs as a result of the reorganization of 1972 were minimal, as far as we were concerned.&#13;
There were none. I think it might have been a bad time. I believe McNamara decreed that the&#13;
Administration Department would be divided into two departments: Admin. Services and Personnel.&#13;
Then the reogranization of 1972 added Organization and Planning. because when we first started as&#13;
Admin. Services we had Bill (William D.S.J Fraser as organizatioft planniDg officer, so we kept&#13;
Organization Planning and then. when the reorganization of 1972 came about, they moved&#13;
Organization and Planning to a separate department and three of us reported to Shoaib for a short&#13;
time and then to Chadcnet. I think that the only spin-off of the 1m reorganization that affeeted&#13;
Admin. Serrices diredly was the creation of Organization and Planning as a separate function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Could you discuss the Bank's administrative philosophy towards such things as staff benefits,&#13;
travel policy and salary?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: I wasn't sure that I could answer tbat question. That was one of the questions I had most&#13;
trouble with when I was reading it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Was there a clear position?&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                             -37-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: I'm not quite sure I know what you mean by administrative philosophy. Does this mean&#13;
how these policies affect Admin., or does it mean was Admin. involved in shaping these policies, and if&#13;
so, how? And then, what was the philosophy behind what we did to do that? The question or&#13;
philosophy in connection with the various services, I believe, is what you're asking.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I guess there is one underlying philosophy, and it went from the top to the level of decision making&#13;
or to the level of recommendation. That had to be the budget. I think there was probably no&#13;
Administrative Services decision--and I would include Personnel as well--that hadn't a serious and&#13;
significant effect on the Bank's budget. This had to be in the minds of either the people down below&#13;
who were proposing changes, or the people at the top who were directing changes, or somewhere in&#13;
between in the evolution of a policy. Obviously, the needs of the staff very often gave me to the&#13;
original recommendations made to management. You find that the staff believes that there is a need&#13;
for a day care center. Now, that idea could have come from someone in the Administration&#13;
Department or in the Personnel Management Department or from the Staff Association. But, as it&#13;
works its way up to the top for a decision, the philosophy that 1 think has to be associated with the&#13;
decision making process is whether it's cost effective. There are certain thiDas which arc on the&#13;
margin. They might never have been able to prove that it was cost effective, but it was such a socially&#13;
attractive thing to do, or it was felt to be so needed by the staff, that you waived the issue of cost&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In addition to cost effectiveness as a criterion or a philosophy, you also had with many of the&#13;
Administrative Services decisions, at least at the time they were taken at the top leve~ a political&#13;
philosophy to concern yourself with. The whole decision as to whether the Bank would participate with&#13;
the Fund in the creation of the Bretton Woods Recreation Center was an example of this. Mr. Woods&#13;
thought this was a good idea, and rm sure the staff or the BaDk thought it was a good idea. It got to&#13;
within an eyelash of being approved, until someone--and I don't know who it \\'a&amp;--reminded Mr.&#13;
Woods that jf we were seen to be putting Bank money into a recreation center, or what was commonly&#13;
called a country club, the votes for IDA, which were already very scarce, would drop off, and it would&#13;
be twice as hard to get IDA funds. So the whole philosophy, which was "this is good for the quality of&#13;
life of the staff members," was washed away beause of a political issllÂ¢.&#13;

&#13;
[TWINING)&#13;
    I think the same thing is happening now witb food services. Pm not sure whether this is political. I&#13;
rather doubt it because ifs been so long that \\'C have had what was alwa,s considered to be a very&#13;
plush food service program, looked at from lhe outside. In fact, it was so plush that at one time we bad&#13;
to have people show their cards at the cafeteria because we were feeding half of G Street, coming&#13;
across from the Federal Govenunent. The reason was because it was subsidized. But, these issues, as&#13;
they become policy, are affected by a great number of philosophies. I would think the single&#13;
philosophy that affected most policies was probably the bud@etary philosophy. that we shouldn't live&#13;
beyond our means and that we should not provide thinp which we couldn't comfortably accommodate&#13;
in the budget, given that we had so much to give to ounelves and so much to give to our member&#13;
countries in terms of our operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It's iroak that in connection with the Bretton Woods Reaeation Center, despite the decision that&#13;
the Bank would not be involved, it was alwa,s referred to as -the Bank's country dub.- On the Hill a&#13;
speech by Senator Long of Maryland would be apinst IDA replenishment in part because those people&#13;
are living too well. "They've got a big country club out there; it's tax-free. Why should we be giving&#13;
them money when they spend it that way?" So, I think Mr. Woods was correct in bis decision that we&#13;
couldn't afford to be involved in it, but it was too late. Just by virtue of the fact that Bank staff&#13;
members can participate in it became a reason to have wished we hadn't been involved with it. I don't&#13;
thiDk I know of any other, John, that would help to describe the philosophy that affected us. Most of it&#13;
had to do, as I say, with a prudent budget policy, and a forced-upon-us political philosophy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: You've made several references to the Staff Assoclation today. Could you briefly characterize&#13;
ADM's relationship with the Staff Association during your directorship?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'IWINING: WeU, I think duriDg the early years of Admin. Se.rvices, about 1971 to 1975, the Staff&#13;
Association--l'm not sure that I know the date on which it was formally created, but in the early&#13;
seventies---was finding its way. It wasn't sure how far it could go to influence Bank management or&#13;
departmental management in pressing demands or grievances of the staff. Prom the management's&#13;
point of view, an active union, which is basieally what it is, was foreign. We had never had one.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                             -39-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
['IWININGJ&#13;
The Fund, on the other bud, did have one from the very beginning I don't know how successful the&#13;
Fund's uuion was. I don't thiDk it was very succes.sful In fact. it became moribund for a while, I think.&#13;
It was inactive and suddeoly when the concept of a Staff Association began in the Bank: it revived the&#13;
Fund union and both of us had Staff Associations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    N. far as the meehanics and tbe procedures we followed with the Staff Association in Admin.&#13;
Services were concerned, we had, of course, many lengthy discussions with members of the Association,&#13;
either the senior officers of the Association or subc:ommittees that they created to deal with different&#13;
subjects. Many of these, in the early days, were chaired by Chadenet as Vice President. He would&#13;
have the appropriate Director or assistant director or division chief come to participate in the meeting,&#13;
whether it was from the Personnel side or the Admin. Services side. These were largely Ad b.RI;&#13;
meetings which were requested by the Chairman of the Staff Association. It continued that way, as I&#13;
remember, for maybe a couple of years, with the initiative left to the Staff Assodation to raise issues&#13;
that they thought were worthy of discussion. I think there were many in the Bank on management side&#13;
at that time who thought it was going to go away. It was a new initiative but it was not going to last.&#13;
How could things be better thaD they were in the World Bank? It probably wasn't until the Association&#13;
had been in existence for maybe two or two-and-a-half years that it was clear to management at the&#13;
highest level and all the way down that it was here to stay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then we began to formalize it. In my department we had an agreement to meet-Â·1 think it was&#13;
monthly--with the Chairman of the Association, and whomever he wanted to bring with him. Of&#13;
course, we'd meet ad )!Qc whenever they had an issue that they thought was worth col'I.Sidering at the&#13;
time. The monthly meetings were attended by myself and other members of the front office, with the&#13;
officers of the Association. We tried to have a11 asenda for each meeting. At 1east it was an agenda&#13;
that referred to the general topic. not a specific issue; we were going to talk about trave1, or space&#13;
planning, or food services, or quality of life-that type of thing. Then, out of those general discussion&#13;
meetings would come specific suggestions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In those earlier days, and I would SU!l'8C&amp;t it's still true today, most of the real burning issues as far&#13;
as the Staff Association was concerned were directed at PMD, and not Admin. Services. We bad more&#13;
tangential issues: is the food hot enough, is the line too long, and canâ&#128;¢t you do something about getting&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
the building cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. These were the type&amp; of issues which,&#13;
wbile they were of interest to a large number of staff members, they could sleep at night whether they&#13;
got an answer, yes or no. But the burning issues were things like pay aDd salary, job dassification and&#13;
travel policy. Travel policy got to be so burning an issue that the staff threatened to strike. I&#13;
remember Mr. Woods caUed a meeting of the entire staff in the Eugene Black Auditorium one day to&#13;
teU them why we were cllanging our travel policy, and what his philosophy was about staff travel&#13;
Again, this had a political origin. We were being criticized heavily by the U.S. Coogresa because so&#13;
many Bank staff members were getting off the front--first class--end of the airplane. Even&#13;
Congressmen weren't always getting off the front end of the airplane. Many of the Bank staff were&#13;
being met by limousines, carted off to their appointed tasks in the member countries, and this was&#13;
evidence of a lifestyle that was much too glamorous for the Congress to agree to vote funds for mA,&#13;
quote, â&#128;¢giveaway" funds. This got to be a very burning issue. I'm not sure it's put to bed yet. I cxpcc:t&#13;
there are still people who don't like the travel policy. The airlines cooperated nicely by creating more&#13;
classes. At that time, wheo Mr. Woods had to make his plea to the staff to &amp;it tight, it was a question of&#13;
fust class venus less-thaa-first-class, and we were taking away first class travel privileges. Wheo I&#13;
traveled for the Bank all during my years in Personnel, and when I was doing recruiting, I always went&#13;
fust class to London. to Paris. wherever. In fact, in the first missious that I went on I got a berth. I was&#13;
in one of those big-bellied Pan Am planes and they put four berths down at the bar level, aDd I went to&#13;
sleep if I could. But that was the issue. It was a first class versus less-than-first-class issue. I don't&#13;
have to go over all of the ramificatious of that and how we dealt v.ith it cwcr the course of time. There&#13;
were various ways of dealing with that issue. As. I say, the air!inea helped us by creating business class&#13;
suddenly, and that was closer to first da.ss than steerage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I think over the course of my career in Admin. Services relations with the Staff Association were&#13;
good. But the Staff Association was rather impatientt in the early days, to show the staff that they were&#13;
worth their salt. They were goiag to get changes made, and our organizational st:ructure was not&#13;
geared to makiDg changes as quietly as the Staff Association thought we should be making them. So&#13;
there was a bit of antagonism there that maybe stiU exists today. I don't know. But, on the whole, the&#13;
issues that came up to me white I was Director were not issues that were too difficult. Largely,&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                               -41-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING}&#13;
they bad to do with food service, with travel which was the biggest, and with space. "Don't make me&#13;
move again; why do I have to move; every time I get myself situated in a nke building and I know my&#13;
neighbors and I know my way then you move us. You're moving us to L Street--my God we'll never get&#13;
there!" That sort of thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Was there a political issue here in terms of the number of concessious made to Staff&#13;
Association?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: No, not that I bow of. No, that never came up in my time. Now, that may have been the&#13;
case in relations with other departments, but we never decided that there would be a quota. This&#13;
month we'd say yes, and that would give us two months of no.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Did you ever have any problems with pressure &amp;om above in terms of selecting candidates for&#13;
jobs, such as an Executive Director wanting a relative on board, with ADM beiDg the most likely spot?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: This question probably should be addressed to PMD, at least in the current context of&#13;
Bank affairs. In the early years, when I was in Personnel, we had a certain amount of this. Very&#13;
seldom were we pressured in any way to take someone for a professional or a policy-making, or&#13;
whatever you want to call it, job. We did have some s~tions made to us by senior Board members&#13;
as to people who could serve on the messenger staff or in the Print Shop or in Office Services. More&#13;
often than not they were people who were, maybe not related to the officer in question, but of his same&#13;
nationality and deserving of any possible help the Bank could give, and often with a tale of woe at home&#13;
where this person had been very badly treated or out of luck or something. But not much. I think tbat&#13;
it could have been very much greater than it was. It really wasn't an issue. It was frowned upon,&#13;
obviously. We were going out of our way to be as objective as we could be about hiring for the staff.&#13;
We've already discussed the U.S. problem and the number of people available from Europe. So, I&#13;
never knew of anybody that was put in any kind of a senior position by virtue of pressure of that kind.&#13;
It was always at a very low level, if it existed at all, and not very often.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Could you discuss the origins of the ADM strengthening exercise?&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                            -42-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: I think I should leave this questions to others as weU. John. At the time we started the&#13;
strengthcaing exercise Bill Cosgrove had been invited to go to Harvard to undertake this course,&#13;
together with Jadt Mossop of the Personnel Management Department, and out of it came the&#13;
strengthening exercise. When Bill went, and when he asked me for permission to go, he didn't know&#13;
precisely what would come of it. All he knew was that it was a program designed to get people to&#13;
consider a new way of what used to be called, or maybe still is, the â&#128;¢quality circle" concept. which up&#13;
until that time had been largely in industry. I guess it originated in Japan, where they got aD the&#13;
workers and sat them around a table at five o'clock in the afternoon and went over the day's activities&#13;
and the members of the "circle" made recommendations as to how they could have been improved. By&#13;
virtue of this you were supposed to get beuer quality, a happier work force and more production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    When Bill came bade he gave us a report of what had transpired and said that he would like to try&#13;
and use it at the Bank. In fad, they had used the Administrative Services Department operations as&#13;
their project presented for this course at Harvard, and they were encouraged by the comments of the&#13;
people who were running the course that this was a good concept for use in ASD and that it should be&#13;
followed up. As a device for getting staff at aD levels involved in management decisions, or at least in&#13;
considering the issues that are involved in running an organization, it's a very useful thing. Whether it's&#13;
a success or a failure, I think probably it's too early to tell. It took, as you wdl know, a great deal of&#13;
staff time. I have no reason to think it hasn't been a success. but there are issues that were discussed in&#13;
these task foree$ which lent themselves to group decision, or group rccommendatioa, and others that&#13;
didn't. How many decisions are going to flow from the involvement of the staff in this sort of tbiog.&#13;
and how much time they spend on it, I think is too early to tell So, I think maybe auother five years&#13;
from now you'll be talking to someone who is here today. and was here when we started the&#13;
strengthening exercise and who will have been there wben it was fully implemented, and he'll be able to&#13;
tell you whether or not it was successful. I tlWlk we already know that some of the proposals have been&#13;
dropped, and that some of the proposals were considered very useful and are well on the way to&#13;
implementation. But I think it's really too early to teU how good it was, whether we were right or&#13;
wrong to spend that amount of time in doing it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Moving on. would you please discuss the evolution of the Bank's physical plant.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1WINING: WeD, that's a lengthy subject. Many hours are spent by staff of Admin. Services and on up&#13;
the ladder, including up to the President, on space planning. The major issue in space planning has&#13;
always been, and probably still is and will always be, whether to plan for the long-term future or the&#13;
short-term future. By long-term, I don't mean next month or next year. I mean a decade away or five&#13;
years away. I suppose if we bad made what we thought were long-term space decisions in 1950 or 19Sl&#13;
we would have found ourselves in just as much trouble as we were ten years later, because we would&#13;
have decided the Bank was going to jp'OW at two percent, four percent, or whatever, and we would have&#13;
built a building to accommodate the size of staff we thought we needed to deal with tbat kind of&#13;
growth. In fact, as you know, one of the options we had was to buy land oa which the Watergate&#13;
apartments are now situated. I'm sure, bad we bought the land then. and built a building. knowing&#13;
what we thought was going to be the size of the staff, it would have been too small, we would have&#13;
outjp'own it, and we would have been completely boxed in. We would have bad the river on one side of&#13;
us and Virginia Avenue on the other and that's as far as we could have gotten. We would then have&#13;
either had to have people commuting from various parts of D.C., or we would have had to pick up and&#13;
move away entirely. So, the issue is: are your growth plans sufficiently clear that you can act on them&#13;
and build buildings that will accommodate you for that many years in the future? I suspect you can't.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But there are certain watershed decisions that we made on space planning. The first, I suppose,&#13;
came when it was decided we should part company with the Fund and not live together in the same&#13;
building. That led to the Fund buying the old fll'e house and the land where the F building is now&#13;
located, and it resulted in the Bank buying the Hurley Wright Building 011 the corner of 18th and Hand&#13;
that little Columbia Lighthouse for the Blind building that was sitting between them, and then going&#13;
around and encompassing the entire block. I think at the time we were doing this nobody thought we'd&#13;
need any more than this b!odc, assuming we got the whole thing, which we eventually did. That&#13;
probably was the first decision that we made, and whether it was a right one or not, who knows?&#13;
Probably we'd have been better off then to have gone to Montgomery County or Fairfax County,&#13;
bought sufficient acreage to expand indefinitely, and built a building that was needed for the size of the&#13;
Bank at that time. K'mdsight being so much better than foresight, that would bave made a lot of sense&#13;
then.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    There bas always been a problem 'With space planning when you talk of long-term future and going&#13;
outside the District, and that is the Board of Directors. The Board, as you know, consists of people&#13;
who are generally serving dual roles. They're either fmancial counselors or other officials at their&#13;
&amp;#12;1WINING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINlNG]&#13;
embassies. They come to the Bank, and they have an office at the Bank, but they also have an offiec in&#13;
the embassy, and they don't want to have to spend an hour going to the headquarten of the Bank&#13;
located in the suburbs to have a meeting or to sit in a Board meeting. So any decision we took to take&#13;
us out of the District of Columbia any distance would have been objected to, Pm sure, by the influential&#13;
Board members. The U.S. bas always, I think, preferred that we be within spitting distance of the&#13;
Treasury. So all of those things militated against doing a lot of loag range space planning. I know Bill&#13;
Cosgrove is now doing some more. I don't know what will come of it, but the question continues: is&#13;
this the right thing to do, to pick up a building here and a lot there. to rent everything we have to in the&#13;
interim? And it's a subject which I'm not sure is one that can ever get the "right" decision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: Were there serious proposals at any stage, that reached a high level, to move?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Oh, yes. The first one was the Watergate space. That was decided negatively becluse at&#13;
that time the Korean War was on and, again. it was a political issue: v.iould it Jook right for the Bank to&#13;
be buying steel to build a big new buildiag at a time when all the resouraa in the U.S. that could go to&#13;
the Korean War should go to it? Then the next decision was should we encompass this wboJe block?&#13;
Should we buy the White Tower, which we never could do, and the building next to it, and the Fund&#13;
buy that apartment building? That was answered af6nnatively. We should and we would probably&#13;
always be able to use tbat block. and it would probably serve us for years and years to come.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then, of course, the next watershed decision was whether we should further separate from the&#13;
Fund, and if they built across the street would we buy their buildiogs from them? That was auswered&#13;
affirmatively. We decided we would, and we did. But each of these decisions was made more or Jess&#13;
out of necessjty. There was never, I think, a reallong-tenn plan for housing the Bank. or of ideal space&#13;
for the Bank. It was always two or three years down the road, and I guess in hindsight it's just as wen&#13;
tbat that was the case because, unless we bad picked up and moved out and bought lots of land, we&#13;
would never have gotten a big enough building. No matter where in the District we'd gone, I think&#13;
we'd never have anticipated the growth that took place in the 1970s. As far as I can see it"s still taking&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: You referred to the negotiations with the Fund on the E and F builcli.Dg$. Do you have any&#13;
additional information that might be interesting. particularly regarding Mr. McNamara's involvement?&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                           -45-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: The negotiations with the Fund were not at all volatile. It had been agreed that the Bank&#13;
would buy the buildings. The Fund, I believe, by that time had already bought, or at least was on the&#13;
verge of buying, and had a commitment to buy, the space across the street. So, it was really not a&#13;
question of yes, up or down. It was a question of how much. The ooly rec:oUection I have of Mr.&#13;
McNamara's involvement, apart from the final decision as to the number, was whether we would be&#13;
tricked into paying too much for what he considered to be a rather elaborate and overly done twelfth&#13;
floor executive suite. As a matter of fact, be was opposed to paying very much for that. He called it a&#13;
waste of space. But later on he began to use it more and more and he used to have farewell&#13;
ceremonies for retiring staff and to welcome new staff there. The administration of the Fund and of&#13;
the Bank couldn't agree initially on the price. So we decided the best way to go was to each hire an&#13;
appraiser and let the appraisers sit and knock each other's beads until they got a figure which they were&#13;
satisfied, between them, was the right figure, based on Washington real estate values. And we did that.&#13;
We didn't fight over the decision. We thought our appraiser had succeeded in getting the right price,&#13;
and I'm sure that the Fund thought that their appraiser had not buclded under and they were getting a&#13;
price they could live with. I don't lmow wbo was right, but we abided by the combined appraisal. It&#13;
was a single figure and the purchase was made.&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: The fact that we've never been able to plan far ahead and purchase surplU&amp; space bas meant&#13;
there's been a lot of internal moves within the Bank. Has the frequency of moves caused you&#13;
problems?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Oh. yes, of course. I think we covered a lot of this question before. It's caused problems&#13;
and will continue to cause problems in the future. I think part of that question was why we did not let&#13;
people go a distance away and let the telephone substitute for walking a block.. Of course, the answer&#13;
is that no matter how easy it is to prove that, with the usc of computers or telephones or whatever. the&#13;
units that work together don't need to be adjacent to each other, it never succeeds in convincing&#13;
anybody who is goiDs to be affected by the move. In the first place, there is a considerable mystique&#13;
about being dose to the President, and an awful lot of Department Directors in the early days, and now&#13;
Vice Presidents, are very reluctant to have their units moved far from where the President's seat is,&#13;
despite the fact that he may never call them, and may seldom see them. It is always pointed out to us,&#13;
whenever we start talkiug about you moving here, you moving there, the large number of meetings that&#13;
are held in the Bank. The Bank is an unusual institution in that everything is done in a collegial&#13;
meeting, and it's very expensive to have to call people from two or three blocks away to have a meeting.&#13;

in a cafeteria, you're going to have to put in a branch of AS &amp; T [American Security and Trust):&#13;
Those are the issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The solution to that problem, as weD as the problems we arc ta1kiDg about before, is to move out&#13;
to Shady Grove, or wherever, au.d buy enoup land that you could continue to erect buildinss attached&#13;
in some fashion to the next one, and have your headquarters there. I don't think that day will ever&#13;
come for the World Bank, but, who knows, it may. Even when we build a new buitdiag. as in my time-&#13;
-I was here but not involved with the building of C. I was here and involved in the building of D, in the&#13;
purchase of E, the purchase ofF, the building of I and the buildmg of H. au.d the start of J, but not the&#13;
fmish--that's not going to solve anything. I suspea that when J is fiDisbed, we will still need to keep&#13;
everybody that's in theN building. which is rented, and which we tried our best to buy but we never&#13;
could. So, I don't see a solution to the space problem other than the solution we've got, which is to&#13;
keep constructing or renting buildings until there is no more space to buy or rent ia the neighborhood.&#13;
Then we're going to have to face up to doing it au.other way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: ADM space proposals are often appealed to the Vice President or President. Is this a&#13;
procedure that works fairly weU. because it gets support from the highest levels for our plans?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: If you mean docs it work very well from the point of view of those who are making the&#13;
proposals in the first pW:e against those who are appealing them because they don't like the propo$81s,&#13;
I suppose it worb weD because it puts the final cap on. It makes the fmal decision. Mr. So-and-so,&#13;
who's the Vu:e President for such-and-such, is going to move, au.d the President sa)'S so. Thatâ&#128;¢s it.&#13;
&amp;#12;TWINING                                           Â·41Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[TWINING]&#13;
We may have fought with him for six months before, expJaioing where be was goiDg to move, and why&#13;
he was going to move, and how his move would be handled, but it wasn't until he had his final day in&#13;
court that he accepted it. To tbat extent, it's a system that works. Obviously, from Admin. Services&#13;
point of view, it would be much cleaner and neater, and I suppose more economical, it they'd take our&#13;
decision in the first place and not appeal it. Appea]s take time. And we don't always w:in. We moved&#13;
the Legal Department across the street one year, with the President's approval, I remember, and the&#13;
howls that went up from the Legal Department were such that, well. they stayed there, but they stayed&#13;
there kicking and screaming and eventually they got a commitment out of the President that the next&#13;
building that was built would see them in it, or at Jeast back in the headquarters building. which&#13;
happened. They came back to the E building. That, too, is a problem that is never going to go away&#13;
until you move away from the crowded D.C. area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: What role did you play in the growth and development of the Bank's field offices and resident&#13;
missions throughout the world?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Practically none. In the course of my service in Technical Assistance, the field missions&#13;
were very few. Mostly we sent missions out to make an on-the-spot study and come baclt agaia. The&#13;
Paris Office was one that we played a part in only because, when they decided to move from Rue de&#13;
Lille to the Avenue d'Iena, we were involved in building the building in the Avenue d'Icua, or buying&#13;
fl1"5t of all a residence down the street and then building a building up the street In the London Office&#13;
we were not involved because this was more or less dooe by Johnny [John L.] Miller who, at that time,&#13;
was a resident in Paris, but a1so was British and who knew how to go about getting into the proper&#13;
streets in London. As far as the field missions are concerned, now we are involved in the sense that&#13;
they"re starting to build some Bank accommodations and there is an architect on the staff of Admin.&#13;
Servkcs, who we hired before I left, who serves as the person who works with the region wbich is&#13;
setting up the mission. The ADM architect who goes out to look for the space, and to advise on the&#13;
type of building to be constructed, the design, etcetera. How many of these \WI will build and maintain&#13;
and own, I don't know. Some countries are very willing to have us do it and others are reluctant to&#13;
have the Bank own any of their property. It's an open question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIR: That draws to a conclusion a very productive interview. On behalf of the Bank's Oral History&#13;
Program, thank you very much, Mr.Twining, for your time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TWINING: Thank you, John. You're welcome.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In May 1985, James E. Twining was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by John Muir. During his tenure at the Bank
            from 1950 to 1984, Mr. Twining worked in the following
            areas: he joined as an assistant personnel officer in 1950;
            worked as assistant personnel manager beginning in 1951; as
            staff in the technical assistance and planning department
            from 1960; and for the administrative services department as
            a deputy director (1965-1971) and as a director (1971-1983).
            His transcript concerns his work in personnel department,
            the role of women at the World Bank in terms of recruitment
            and promotion to higher level positions, the contribution of
            the staff association to the personnel department, his role
            on the technical assistance and planning staff, and the
            effects of the 1972 reorganization on administration.
