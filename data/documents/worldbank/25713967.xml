7.     (a) The Interpretative Addendum and all annexes hereto and the Framework Agreement between&#13;
the World Bank Group and the European Commission constitute an integral part of this Administration&#13;
Agreement, whose terms taken together shall constitute the entire agreement and understanding between&#13;
the Donor and the Bank. In the event of any inconsistency, the Framework Agreement prevails over the&#13;
Administration Agreement and the Administration Agreement (including its Interpretative Addendum)&#13;
prevails over its Annexes. Unless otherwise specified in an annex hereto, this Administration Agreement&#13;
may be amended only by written amendment between the Bank and the Donor; provided, however, that&#13;
any annexes to this Administration Agreement may be amended only by written amendment of all donors&#13;
contributing to the Trust Fund.&#13;
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph 6.1 of Annex 2 to this Administration Agreement, the End&#13;
Disbursement Date for purposes of the Contribution is November 30, 2018.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿8.     Individual procurement and grant contracts under this Administration Agreement shall be signed&#13;
by the World Bank Group entity no later than thirty-five (35) months from the date of signature of this&#13;
Administration Agreement.&#13;
9.      The following derogations from the Framework Agreement shall apply:&#13;
Article 2.6 of the 2014 Framework Agreement specifies that, "in duly justified cases of crisis and&#13;
emergency and post-recovery situations," derogations from the terms of the 2014 Framework Agreement&#13;
may be made. Given that this Administration Agreement aims at supporting activities for the benefit of&#13;
Ethiopia, and given that Ethiopia, in the opinion of the Parties, represents such a case where such&#13;
derogations are justified, the Parties hereby agree to derogate from the 2014 Framework Agreement for the&#13;
reasons and in the manner as follow:&#13;
Through its Article 14.1.4, the 2014 Framework Agreement sets forth a notional approach for determining&#13;
compliance with cost eligibility requirements in the case of a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF), such as this&#13;
TF072448. Such an approach is required because in an MDTF various donors contribute to an account in&#13;
which their funds are commingled with those of the other donors, and thus compliance with each particular&#13;
donor's rules regarding the use of its funds is impossible to ascertain when the separate use of a particular&#13;
donor's contribution is not traceable within that commingled account.&#13;
However, said Article 14.1.4's application of the notional approach solely to cost eligibility requirements&#13;
is insufficient to cover issues raised by the untraceability of an individual donor's funds when the relevant&#13;
commingled account extends beyond the confines of the MDTF account. For example, commingled&#13;
amounts in the PSNP IV Trust Fund are disbursed into an account managed by the Ethiopian government,&#13;
wherein they are further commingled with funds contributed by Ethiopia itself and other joint cofinanciers&#13;
of the PSNP IV. It is from this greater account (the Joint Cofinancing Account) that funds are then applied&#13;
for purposes of carrying out activities under the PSNP IV. Because said Article 14.1.4 does not extend the&#13;
notional approach to this Joint Cofinancing Account, the Parties hereby derogate from said Article's&#13;
provisions by explicitly expanding them to cover the particularities of the PSNP IV case.&#13;
Pursuant to such derogation, if an amount of funds contributed to the Trust Fund by the European&#13;
Commission is alleged to have not been used in a manner consistent with the terms of this Administration&#13;
Agreement (the questioned amount), the European Commission shall deem such use to have been&#13;
compliant with the terms of this Administration Agreement if, as of the time of the alleged ineligibility,&#13;
amounts contributed to the Joint Cofinancing Account by other PSNP IV joint cofinanciers, including&#13;
other donors to the TF 072448, were equal to or greater than the questioned amount.&#13;
10.    The measures taken to identify the EU as a source of financing shall be in accordance with&#13;
Attachment 4 of the Framework Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿11.     Each of the Parties represents, by confirming its agreement below, that it is authorized to enter&#13;
into this Administration Agreement and act in accordance with these terms and conditions. The Parties are&#13;
requested to sign and date this Administration Agreement, and upon possession by the Bank of this fully&#13;
signed Administration Agreement, this Administration Agreement shall become effective as of the date of&#13;
the last signature&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿Interpretative Addendum&#13;
For purposes of interpreting Art. 14.1.4 of the 2014 Framework Agreement (and not as a derogation from&#13;
such Article), - the "notional approach" referred to therein shall apply in the following manner in cases of&#13;
both Direct and Indirect Management modalities:&#13;
a) This Trust Fund is a "Multi Donor Trust Fund" or "MDTF," defined as follows in Article 1(v)&#13;
of the 2014 Framework Agreement: "a trust fund that may receive contributions from more than&#13;
one donor, whose funds are pooled under a single set of agreed terms and such funds are not&#13;
earmarked by individual donors for specific categories of expenditures, also known as 'joint co-&#13;
financing' by the Commission." Consequently, the contributions from the Commission, as well as&#13;
from other donors ("Other Contributions"), form an account of commingled funds (the "MDTF&#13;
Pool") within which no one particular donor's contribution can be traced.&#13;
b) In administering the MDTF Pool, the Bank applies terms that are the same for all contributions&#13;
to the MDTF, in addition to the terms, derived from the 2014 Framework Agreement, that apply&#13;
solely to the Commission Contribution ("Commission Terms"). Examples of Commission Terms&#13;
include (i) that costs are incurred within a specified time period (2014 Framework Agreement&#13;
Arts. 14.1.1(c) and 14.2.1(b)), (ii) that costs are verifiable through supporting documents retained&#13;
for 7-years after the applicable End Disbursement Date (2014 Framework Agreement Arts.&#13;
14.1.1(e), 14.2.1(d) and 17.4), or (iii) that the Trust Fund pay for indirect costs only at levels not&#13;
exceeding those accepted by the Commission pursuant to 2014 Framework Agreement Art. 13.4.&#13;
c) The notional approach allows the Commission to participate in MDTFs where not all&#13;
expenditures would be eligible for the Commission (see point b immediately above) without&#13;
earmarking its contribution to specific items or on the basis of geographical criteria. It allows so&#13;
by verifying that there is enough expenditure in the MDTF eligible in accordance with the&#13;
Commission Terms to justify the Commission contribution.&#13;
d) Consequently, if, in carrying out verifications or audits of the Trust Fund under 2014&#13;
Framework Agreement Art. 17.2, a sampling by a European Union competent body finds&#13;
ineligible expenditures because of non-compliance solely with Commission Terms, no refunds&#13;
need be made by the Bank or any Recipients, nor shall adjustments be made under 2014&#13;
Framework Agreement Art. 15.3.1, nor shall any offsets be applied under 2014 Framework&#13;
Agreement Art. 16.5 or otherwise, as long as sufficient Other Contributions to cover the amount&#13;
of such expenditures were made to the MDTF Pool before the End Disbursement Date. Such&#13;
refunds, adjustments or offsets may only be applied (i) if, and to the extent, the ineligible&#13;
expenditures are in excess of Other Contributions and (ii) if the Bank does not provide&#13;
documentation to justify that an amount equal to such ineligible expenditures is covered by the&#13;
Other Contributions.&#13;
The provisions of this paragraph shall be applied in conjunction and are consistent with Art. 17 of, and&#13;
Attachment 3 to, the 2014 Framework Agreement, and are also consistent with the terms of Art. 42.2 of&#13;
the Rules of Application (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012).&#13;
&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between the&#13;
Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1    The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to&#13;
time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its&#13;
framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of&#13;
Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the&#13;
relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United&#13;
Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under&#13;
the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual&#13;
member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be&#13;
kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has&#13;
legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit&#13;
Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate&#13;
obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete&#13;
activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any&#13;
responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies&#13;
as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust&#13;
Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Instalment, an&#13;
amount equal to one per cent (1%) per Instalment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management and&#13;
Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex I of the Administration Agreements in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis&#13;
up to a maximum of zero point five per cent (0.5%) of the total Contributions under all Administration&#13;
Agreements.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund&#13;
Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first&#13;
Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank&#13;
reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would&#13;
be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would&#13;
thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement&#13;
existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1    The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds deposited in&#13;
the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
4.2    The Bank shall furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the World&#13;
Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all commitments and&#13;
liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial&#13;
information relating to receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to&#13;
the Contributions shall be made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center&#13;
secure website.&#13;
4.3    The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure&#13;

contributions from the European Commission and/or other donors to the Trust Fund pursuant to their&#13;
respective Administration Agreement and/or 2) Ethiopia's receipt of additional contributions from other&#13;
joint financiers. The updated indicative total budget will be deemed to have been agreed by both parties&#13;
without the need to further amend the indicative total budget amount in this Annex and in paragraph 1 of&#13;
this Agreement.&#13;
The Bank may transfer amounts between categories of the indicative budget. This does not require an&#13;
amendment of this Agreement if the Contribution is used to finance the activities set forth in Annex 1.&#13;
