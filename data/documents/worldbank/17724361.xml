                     P R O C E E D I N G S&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STIGLITZ:     Let me begin by thanking you for&#13;
&#13;
 the opportunity to present the outline of the World&#13;
&#13;
 Development Report for 2000-2001.        We just released last&#13;
&#13;
 week last year's and we are already well underway for next&#13;
&#13;
 year's.&#13;
&#13;
           The subject of this World Development Report is&#13;
&#13;
 on poverty.   We have had a WDR on poverty every ten years,&#13;
&#13;
 and I think one of the striking things about this report&#13;
&#13;
 on poverty is how thinking has changed so markedly over&#13;
&#13;
 the last decade.   And I think that is one of the things&#13;
&#13;
 that they are going to try to point out.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me introduce the Director and the Co-&#13;
&#13;
 Director of the WDR:    Ravi Kanbur, who was very active at&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank for a long time before we lost him very briefly&#13;
&#13;
 to Cornell where he became a professor, and we have&#13;
&#13;
 recruited him back to work on this, one of the most&#13;
&#13;
 distinguished development economists in the world; and we&#13;
&#13;
 were also very lucky to recruit Nora Lustig from the IDB&#13;
&#13;
 who is one of the senior advisors at IDB.           This represents&#13;
&#13;
 one of the kinds of examples of close cooperation between&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank and other multilateral institutions.          They were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 kind enough to second Nora to the World Bank for this&#13;
&#13;
 project.&#13;
&#13;
            And the two of them together have put together&#13;
&#13;
 what I think is a very good team and have been involved in&#13;
&#13;
 a very active process of consultation on the issues of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty around the world, fulfilling I think one of the&#13;
&#13;
 major functions of a WDR which is not only the product&#13;
&#13;
 that comes out at the end of the process but the actual&#13;
&#13;
 process of formulating the ideas, discussing other ideas,&#13;
&#13;
 that the WDR is really a way of stimulating an&#13;
&#13;
 international dialogue on a particular issue every year.&#13;
&#13;
 And I think this year's issue on poverty is clearly one&#13;
&#13;
 that is of central concern to this institution.&#13;
&#13;
            So without further ado, let me turn this over to&#13;
&#13;
 Ravi.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. KANBUR:   Well, thank you very much indeed,&#13;
&#13;
 Joe.    I will say a few words briefly and then we can get&#13;
&#13;
 into the discussion.     I think the main thing is for us to&#13;
&#13;
 hear from you.&#13;
&#13;
            As Joe said, this is a World Development Report&#13;
&#13;
 which is done every ten years on poverty.           So, the natural&#13;
&#13;
 reference point for us is the report that was done ten&#13;
&#13;
 years ago, the 1990 World Development Report.          And I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 thought it might be interesting to just step back and ask&#13;
&#13;
 the question what people were thinking this time ten years&#13;
&#13;
 ago when the team came to present to you their outline.&#13;
&#13;
           In fact, Michael Walton, who has just joined us&#13;
&#13;
 here, was a member of that team.       You know him as being&#13;
&#13;
 the Director of Poverty Reduction, and I was an advisor to&#13;
&#13;
 that team.   So, we are no strangers to that report.&#13;
&#13;
           And it was really quite interesting, the&#13;
&#13;
 approach that was taken, which is very similar to the&#13;
&#13;
 approach we are taking, which was to ask the question:&#13;
&#13;
 Looking back from 1990, looking back from 1989, where had&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction taken place and where had poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction not taken place?     And that was the question that&#13;
&#13;
 was asked.   And the answer that was given was actually&#13;
&#13;
 appealingly simple, partly because the world was so simple&#13;
&#13;
 in those days, I suppose, and partly because the&#13;
&#13;
 frameworks were perhaps simple as well.&#13;
&#13;
           The answer was essentially that in a clutch of&#13;
&#13;
 East Asian economies, looking back from 1990, twenty years&#13;
&#13;
 back or fifteen years back, there has been tremendous&#13;
&#13;
 reduction in poverty; no matter what measure you took, no&#13;
&#13;
 matter what indicator you took, poverty had gone down,&#13;
&#13;
 income, non-income, anything.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           And in a clutch of other economies in Latin&#13;
&#13;
 America, Africa, South Asia, there had been less than&#13;
&#13;
 stellar performance.     And that was the appealingly simple&#13;
&#13;
 answer that was given to the question:           Where has poverty&#13;
&#13;
 come down?&#13;
&#13;
           And the question that was posed was:          Well, what&#13;
&#13;
 was it that these East Asian economies did which the other&#13;
&#13;
 economies didn't?    What was it that Indonesia did that&#13;
&#13;
 Brazil didn't, which led to the difference in performance&#13;
&#13;
 on poverty?   And the answer was given in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 famous two-part strategy -- the labor-intensive growth and&#13;
&#13;
 widespread provision of social services.&#13;
&#13;
           The question was then asked:           Well, what is it&#13;
&#13;
 that leads to labor-intensive growth?           And not so much in&#13;
&#13;
 that WDR, although there was some discussion in that, but&#13;
&#13;
 in a whole series of Bank documents in the late 1980s and&#13;
&#13;
 early 1990s, the answer to what leads to labor-intensive&#13;
&#13;
 growth was given essentially in terms of a market-oriented&#13;
&#13;
 development, market liberalization, in the area of trade,&#13;
&#13;
 in the area of state-owned enterprises and so on and so&#13;
&#13;
 forth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           So that very much was the perspective of 1990,&#13;
&#13;
 of 1989, in fact, when the team came together to produce&#13;
&#13;
 the last report.&#13;
&#13;
           Our approach -- and I should say that this paper&#13;
&#13;
 is not the report, but it is the approach to the report;&#13;
&#13;
 we are still working on it -- and our approach has&#13;
&#13;
 essentially been based on trying to do three things --&#13;
&#13;
 firstly, to look at the world of events to see what has&#13;
&#13;
 happened in the world in the last dozen years or so in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of poverty reduction, essentially posing the same&#13;
&#13;
 question that the team posed ten years ago; secondly,&#13;
&#13;
 looking at the world of ideas, analyses, perspectives,&#13;
&#13;
 frameworks, how have those evolved over the last ten,&#13;
&#13;
 fifteen years; and thirdly, actually to look at the world&#13;
&#13;
 of the poor, to directly go and ask poor people what is it&#13;
&#13;
 that their concerns are, reviewing participatory poverty&#13;
&#13;
 assessments.   We are also conducting a major exercise, a&#13;
&#13;
 consultations with the poor exercise.&#13;
&#13;
           So very briefly, in terms of the world of&#13;
&#13;
 events, what we find is in a way, unlike the picture ten&#13;
&#13;
 years ago where it was very clear it was East Asia and&#13;
&#13;
 then the rest, the picture on poverty reduction is much,&#13;
&#13;
 much more complicated, varied, nuanced now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           So, take the case of Indonesia.          Would we say&#13;
&#13;
 that Indonesia has had a good performance or not so good&#13;
&#13;
 performance?   Well, the answer depends on where you use&#13;
&#13;
 the cutoff date, whether you talk about the period before&#13;
&#13;
 1997 or the period after 1997.&#13;
&#13;
           The whole series of transition economies have&#13;
&#13;
 now come onto the scene, and these were not discussed ago&#13;
&#13;
 in the report ten years ago.      So, not only has this entire&#13;
&#13;
 new group of economies come on the scene, but within these&#13;
&#13;
 economies, there is tremendous variation in performance.&#13;
&#13;
 Within Africa, which we generally thought of ten years ago&#13;
&#13;
 as having an undifferentiatedly bad performance, there is&#13;
&#13;
 now a differentiation coming through in terms of Uganda&#13;
&#13;
 and Mali, on the one hand, versus other countries and so&#13;
&#13;
 on.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think we cannot give as appealingly simple&#13;
&#13;
 an answer as we did ten years ago in terms of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction performance.&#13;
&#13;
           The second sort of thing that has happened is,&#13;
&#13;
 of course, that there has been a broad movement towards&#13;
&#13;
 market liberalization the world over.&#13;
&#13;
           The third thing that we see in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 world events are the big global trends that are taking&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 place which have actually brought the world to a very&#13;
&#13;
 different point ten years on than where we were ten years&#13;
&#13;
 ago, in terms of technological movement, in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 capital flows, in terms of population, demographics.    AIDS&#13;
&#13;
 was not really on the scene in the way that it is today&#13;
&#13;
 and so on.   And we discuss this in the approach paper.&#13;
&#13;
           So, in a way, the world now is very different&#13;
&#13;
 from the world that the team encountered ten years ago.&#13;
&#13;
 And I should say finally also in terms of non-economic&#13;
&#13;
 trends that the process of democratization,&#13;
&#13;
 decentralization, the resurgence of civil society,&#13;
&#13;
 participation and so on has also moved in a way that was&#13;
&#13;
 really not on our radar screens ten, fifteen years ago.&#13;
&#13;
           The world of ideas hasn't stood still either.&#13;
&#13;
 There has been this tremendous debate in terms of market&#13;
&#13;
 liberalization, both in terms of its specifics and in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of its generalities.     And I don't need to say any&#13;
&#13;
 more on that since we have Joe Stiglitz sitting here.&#13;
&#13;
           But the issue is not so much a sort of a crass&#13;
&#13;
 thing of liberalization good or liberalization bad.    This&#13;
&#13;
 is much more the tremendously varied responses to&#13;
&#13;
 different types of liberalization that we have had.    Two&#13;
&#13;
 countries, both of whom reduced tariffs and have very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 different outcomes, well, maybe that is something to do&#13;
&#13;
 with the way customs services operate in the two&#13;
&#13;
 countries.    Two countries undertake a privatization&#13;
&#13;
 program, very different outcome.        Well, maybe that has&#13;
&#13;
 something to do with the regulatory structures in those&#13;
&#13;
 two countries and so on.&#13;
&#13;
             So, I think we have a much more nuanced view of&#13;
&#13;
 those things in the world of ideas, discussion and&#13;
&#13;
 analysis.&#13;
&#13;
             Related to this -- and I am sort of hinting at&#13;
&#13;
 this -- is the whole issue of institutions has come center&#13;
&#13;
 stage in economic analysis certainly and in terms of broad&#13;
&#13;
 academic analysis.    Ronald Koss [phonetic] and Douglas&#13;
&#13;
 North were awarded the Nobel Prize in these last ten&#13;
&#13;
 years, something that perhaps would not have been&#13;
&#13;
 thinkable in the ten years before ten years ago.&#13;
&#13;
             Another thing I would say, for example, is that&#13;
&#13;
 in terms of inequality and growth, distribution and&#13;
&#13;
 growth, the focus in the literature of the last ten years&#13;
&#13;
 has been much more on the causality from inequality to&#13;
&#13;
 growth.   Ten years ago, the discussion was:        Does higher&#13;
&#13;
 growth lead to higher inequality or lower inequality or no&#13;
&#13;
 effect whatsoever?&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           In the WDR of 1980, the argument was made that&#13;
&#13;
 actually growth is accompanied by increasing inequality.&#13;
&#13;
 In the WDR of 1990, the argument was made that growth is&#13;
&#13;
 not accompanied by increasing inequality.&#13;

           In the ten years since that, since the 1990&#13;
&#13;
 report, the literature has moved to asking the question&#13;
&#13;
 not whether growth is or is not accompanied by inequality,&#13;
&#13;
 although that is an interesting question, but whether&#13;
&#13;
 inequality impedes growth or not, the causality looking at&#13;
&#13;
 it the other way around.&#13;
&#13;
           This gives you an idea of how things have been&#13;
&#13;
 moving in the last ten years.&#13;
&#13;
           The final thing I would say in the world of&#13;
&#13;
 ideas and analysis -- and you know, we discussed in much&#13;
&#13;
 greater detail in the paper -- is that micro data sets&#13;
&#13;
 have become much more available now than they were ten,&#13;
&#13;
 fifteen years ago, household survey data, panel data,&#13;
&#13;
 ability to follow households through their ups and downs&#13;
&#13;
 over time.   So much greater focus on volatility,&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability, risks coming out of this very micro level&#13;
&#13;
 perspective, intra-household issues, concerns of gender.&#13;
&#13;
 These things have come on stage in a way that they weren't&#13;
&#13;
 there ten, fifteen years ago.&#13;

&#13;
            So, finally, the world of events, the world of&#13;
&#13;
 ideas and then the world of the poor themselves.      And what&#13;
&#13;
 we have done as part of the preparation for this is, in&#13;
&#13;
 fact, we have reviewed the participatory poverty&#13;
&#13;
 assessments that the World Bank has done; we have reviewed&#13;
&#13;
 the participatory work that has been done outside the&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank, and we have also launched a major series of&#13;
&#13;
 studies called "Consultations with the Poor", and some of&#13;
&#13;
 you were there.   The global synthesis workshop is actually&#13;
&#13;
 going on as we speak today.&#13;
&#13;
            And some very interesting things come out of&#13;
&#13;
 these studies.    The first thing that comes out is that&#13;
&#13;
 lots and lots of different things matter to the poor on&#13;
&#13;
 the ground.   In terms of their sectoral needs, there is&#13;
&#13;
 not a single thing that you can say this is it, but it is&#13;
&#13;
 a number of interrelated issues that come up.       It is very&#13;
&#13;
 -- if I might use the word -- comprehensive view of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.&#13;
&#13;
            Now poor people do indeed have priorities on the&#13;
&#13;
 ground, but these priorities vary from place to place.      If&#13;
&#13;
 it is schools in one place, it is health clinics in&#13;
&#13;
 another.   If it is flood relief in one place, it is&#13;
&#13;
 drought in another.    It depends very much on local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 circumstances, so that universal prescriptions, universal&#13;
&#13;
 sectoral prescriptions are unlikely to work.&#13;
&#13;
           But having said that, having talked about this&#13;
&#13;
 diversity, there are three things which come through very&#13;
&#13;
 clearly from this voices of the poor exercise that we have&#13;
&#13;
 conducted -- and you can find out the detail of that in&#13;
&#13;
 the paper and we can give you more detail later on.&#13;
&#13;
           There are three commonalities which we find,&#13;
&#13;
 whether we are in Bulgaria, Bolivia, Bangladesh; whether&#13;
&#13;
 in fact the sectoral party is schools or health clinics or&#13;
&#13;
 whether it is floods or drought relief, there are three&#13;
&#13;
 commonalities.&#13;
&#13;
           One is the issue of voiceless, powerlessness,&#13;
&#13;
 inability to influence institutions of the state which in&#13;
&#13;
 turn influence poor people's lives.        This alienation from&#13;
&#13;
 local level institutions, the failure of state&#13;
&#13;
 institutions just comes through no matter where you are in&#13;
&#13;
 the world.&#13;
&#13;
           The second factor that comes through very, very&#13;
&#13;
 strongly is the issue of risk and vulnerability, the&#13;
&#13;
 notion of precariousness of existence.         You know, I am all&#13;
&#13;
 right today, but what if something goes wrong the way that&#13;
&#13;
 it went wrong for my brother-in-law last year?         You see&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 these things coming through again and again; risk and&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability, the precariousness, volatility,&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability come through again and again.&#13;
&#13;
           And the third thing that comes through which is&#13;
&#13;
 very common across is -- it should not be surprising -- it&#13;
&#13;
 is the conventional income earning opportunities issue.&#13;
&#13;
 There was some sort of fear that we go to this&#13;
&#13;
 participative thing and then the income issue will take a&#13;
&#13;
 back seat.   Well, actually no.     In fact, poor people say&#13;
&#13;
 that the jobs and wages, assets, income-earning&#13;
&#13;
 opportunities issue is quite prominent in their minds.&#13;
&#13;
           So, these three things -- the voicelessness,&#13;
&#13;
 powerlessness, the links to institutions, institutional&#13;
&#13;
 inequalities in society, the risk and vulnerability&#13;
&#13;
 precariousness and the income-earning opportunities thing&#13;
&#13;
 come through in this voices of the poor, and we believe&#13;
&#13;
 that they mesh very well with our assessment of the world&#13;
&#13;
 of events and the world of ideas.&#13;
&#13;
           And it is these three things that we have built&#13;
&#13;
 our approach around in this World Development Report.     Our&#13;
&#13;
 approach in terms of treating these issues is what we call&#13;
&#13;
 an empowerment security opportunity approach.      By&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, we mean addressing a whole host of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 institutional, economic and social inequalities which not&#13;
&#13;
 only impede prospects for the poor, but, referring back to&#13;
&#13;
 the literature I talked about, actually impede the&#13;
&#13;
 prospects for growth as well.&#13;
&#13;
            Second is the issue of security, which is&#13;
&#13;
 addressing the questions of risk and vulnerability at the&#13;
&#13;
 very micro level and at the very macro level, clearly&#13;
&#13;
 something that comes out not only from the voices of the&#13;
&#13;
 poor but the way that events in the world have moved and&#13;
&#13;
 the way that the ideas and analysis world has also moved.&#13;
&#13;
            And third is what we call opportunity, which is&#13;
&#13;
 what are the mechanisms and what are the reforms and&#13;
&#13;
 policies which will get us sustained economic expansion?&#13;
&#13;
            So these are the three areas in which we propose&#13;
&#13;
 to conduct a further analysis.      In this approach paper, we&#13;
&#13;
 give you some ideas of how we are going to do it, and&#13;
&#13;
 maybe in the discussion we can discuss these issues&#13;
&#13;
 further.&#13;
&#13;
            Maybe in the discussion I can also give you some&#13;
&#13;
 flavor of what came out when we took the initial ideas for&#13;
&#13;
 this outline on the road, what we heard from people, from&#13;
&#13;
 civil society, from policymakers and so on.        We heard a&#13;
&#13;
 lot about the outline but we also heard an earful about&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 what they thought about the Bank in this context.      So&#13;
&#13;
 maybe we can give you some of the flavor of that as well&#13;
&#13;
 during the discussion.&#13;
&#13;
             We have a little bit of that in the approach&#13;

 paper, but maybe it is best done verbally as well.&#13;

             Thank you.&#13;

             MR. STIGLITZ:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             Ravi, do you want to introduce some of the other&#13;
&#13;
 members of your team very briefly?&#13;
&#13;
             MR. KANBUR:   Yes.   [No microphone] -- we have&#13;
&#13;
 Christiann Grottaert who is the Social Development Family;&#13;
&#13;
 moving along with have Alice Sindzingre, who is being&#13;
&#13;
 seconded from CNRS in Paris to us, is a very well-known&#13;
&#13;
 social anthropologist who has worked a lot on Africa; and&#13;
&#13;
 we have Monica Das Gupta also on the team who has just&#13;
&#13;
 joined the Bank from Harvard and we grabbed her to be on&#13;
&#13;
 the team.&#13;
&#13;
             Some members of the team are still not here.      We&#13;
&#13;
 have Zino Yusof [phonetic] from Malaysia who is actually&#13;
&#13;
 making sure that the capital controls are working well in&#13;
&#13;
 Malaysia this week, and he will join us next week on the&#13;

&#13;
           MR. STIGLITZ:    Okay.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Sinclair.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SINCLAIR:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           I think what I would like to say is that what I&#13;
&#13;
 am hearing from Ravi and what I have heard from other&#13;
&#13;
 members of his team over the last months is very, very&#13;
&#13;
 welcome news.   In fact, one of my dilemmas in some senses&#13;
&#13;
 is the process has been so open and the spread of&#13;
&#13;
 innovative ideas so fast that at times I have to stop and&#13;
&#13;
 remind myself that formal publication is still a year&#13;
&#13;
 away.   But I think that is obviously a very, very positive&#13;
&#13;
 sign.&#13;
&#13;
           And in that sense, when I look at the process --&#13;
&#13;
 and I would like to deal a little bit briefly with the&#13;
&#13;
 process -- I think the team has to be congratulated on a&#13;
&#13;
 very, very open approach for the WDR.         In fact, I think&#13;
&#13;
 this may be one case.     I know, Joe, you said this was the&#13;
&#13;
 generic reality, but I think this is certainly one case to&#13;
&#13;
 my mind where the process is already more important than&#13;
&#13;
 the published text that we are all going to see in a&#13;
&#13;
 year's time, not to discount the published text.        I know&#13;
&#13;
 that will be a very impressive document when we do see it,&#13;
&#13;
 but I think quite honestly the process of engaging&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 different actors is actually the most centrally beneficial&#13;
&#13;
 aspect of the work that we are seeing on this WDR.&#13;
&#13;
           The extensive dialogue and debate with donors,&#13;
&#13;
 with civil society, with governments, and I think most&#13;
&#13;
 critically with the poor themselves is I think a model&#13;
&#13;
 that will certainly challenge future WDR authors and the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank as a whole in years to come.       It will be a complex&#13;
&#13;
 and difficult challenge to replicate.&#13;
&#13;
           The technology of the Internet certainly has&#13;
&#13;
 helped but, in truth, I think the real impact to my mind&#13;
&#13;
 has been in the depth and diversity of old-fashioned,&#13;
&#13;
 face-to-face dialogue, whether it is individual or groups&#13;
&#13;
 of people coming together at numerous sites across the&#13;
&#13;
 world and, very importantly, very much across the Third&#13;
&#13;
 World.&#13;
&#13;
           I think a key challenge in fact in some senses&#13;
&#13;
 will be to maintain the momentum and continuity of that&#13;
&#13;
 engagement.   I think if I leap from the pre to the post-&#13;
&#13;
 WDR era, I think one of the key issues is going to be how&#13;
&#13;
 do we embody all of these issues in our own work.      The CDF&#13;
&#13;
 can perhaps be the vehicle for some countries.      The HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 Initiative in some senses will be for others.      But I think&#13;
&#13;
 we will need many more.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           On the new perspectives on poverty that Ravi has&#13;
&#13;
 been outlining to us, I think without defining any final&#13;
&#13;
 views, I can say that we very much welcome the more&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive, the more organic perspective on poverty&#13;
&#13;
 that lies at the heart of this outline.            I was thinking as&#13;
&#13;
 Ravi was speaking that when I talked to my colleagues from&#13;
&#13;
 the NGO community they may in the same spirit as our&#13;
&#13;
 discussion of the CDF say, well, these aren't new ideas;&#13;
&#13;
 these are things we have been telling you donors for the&#13;
&#13;
 last twenty years or so.    But it is very, very important&#13;
&#13;
 all the same that we are actually listening now and&#13;
&#13;
 hearing those messages.    And in that sense, I was one of&#13;
&#13;
 those who was downstairs in the session a few floors below&#13;
&#13;
 us yesterday on the Voices for the Poor, and I must admit,&#13;
&#13;
 you know, you don't have to be there in that room for very&#13;
&#13;
 long to recognize that poverty is indeed a very complex,&#13;
&#13;
 multi-faceted reality, and I think also to recognize that&#13;
&#13;
 it is a debate about people, disadvantaged children,&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerable women, anxious workers.        And I think those are&#13;
&#13;
 very, very important issues.&#13;
&#13;
           In that sense, I think the elements that Ravi&#13;
&#13;
 used to sort of capture all those ideas -- empowerment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 security and opportunity -- are a very neat and compact&#13;
&#13;
 way of embodying those very complex dimensions.&#13;
&#13;
           It is certainly resonant with some central&#13;
&#13;
 themes of Canadian Development Cooperation policy, but I&#13;
&#13;
 think most basically they reflect the human reality that&#13;
&#13;
 we all slowly recognize as poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we agree with those who also see that&#13;
&#13;
 economic growth is a necessary but certainly very far from&#13;
&#13;
 sufficient route to poverty reduction.         And maybe we won't&#13;
&#13;
 have all the answers today, but I am particularly struck&#13;
&#13;
 by the new analytical material that Ravi and others have&#13;
&#13;
 commented on.   The suggested quality may, in fact, be an&#13;
&#13;
 impediment to growth rather than a by-product of&#13;
&#13;
 inadequate growth.&#13;
&#13;
           In that sense, I think we see this much broader&#13;
&#13;
 WDR agenda as part of the process of moving the approach&#13;
&#13;
 of the Bank and others in the development community beyond&#13;
&#13;
 even maybe what we talked about way, way back in the&#13;
&#13;
 1970s, growth with equity.&#13;
&#13;
           I think there is a qualitative advance in a&#13;
&#13;
 sense of the thinking -- maybe if I am a little rude -- in&#13;
&#13;
 the rather linear approach of the 1990 WDR.        I think it&#13;
&#13;
 forces us to revisit some of the specifics of how&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 societies function, good policy, effective institutions&#13;
&#13;
 and so on.&#13;
&#13;
           Intriguingly, and it came out of yesterday's&#13;
&#13;
 discussion downstairs, there still seems to be some&#13;
&#13;
 ambiguity which is part of the challenge as to whether the&#13;
&#13;
 poor themselves, unhappy as they already are and very&#13;
&#13;
 explicit on their concerns with existing structures, have&#13;
&#13;
 yet in a sense got that magic bullet or magic collection&#13;
&#13;
 of bullets in Ravi's correct vocabulary, which will&#13;
&#13;
 represent new ideas, new thinking as to how we can tackle&#13;
&#13;
 some of the very clear challenges that will make for&#13;
&#13;
 effective pro-poor programming.&#13;
&#13;
           Clearly, just around this room a few days ago,&#13;
&#13;
 we talked about the poverty reduction strategies.      And I&#13;
&#13;
 think in many ways those are going to become a very, very&#13;
&#13;
 important vehicle for translating the thinking in this&#13;
&#13;
 document into the real world of nations, of local politics&#13;
&#13;
 and the globalized economy.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me deal with one other major theme, which is&#13;
&#13;
 the issues of mainstreaming.      From my perspective, in a&#13;
&#13;
 sense -- and I suppose it comes back to this perspective&#13;
&#13;
 of the document being less important than the process --&#13;

&#13;
 participatory CASs, the CDF and so on, we do have to find&#13;
&#13;
 the means of taking poverty to the central daily&#13;
&#13;
 activities, the normal thinking process.           And that is&#13;
&#13;
 going to be a daunting challenge.       There are many&#13;
&#13;
 conservative forces -- and I am being very frank -- many&#13;
&#13;
 bureaucratic hurdles that are around.&#13;
&#13;
           And, in that sense, although I know it is not&#13;
&#13;
 the mandate of the WDR to sort of prescribe for us all&#13;
&#13;
 what we have to do with this, I hope it is at least going&#13;
&#13;
 to give us some hints as to what we have to do inside&#13;
&#13;
 other donors, in general, governments in general, to build&#13;
&#13;
 upon these very stimulating ideas, which I think we are&#13;
&#13;
 going to see in this document.&#13;
&#13;
           Maybe one of those elements in that open&#13;
&#13;
 consultative process is to bring some of those actors&#13;
&#13;
 together even before the WDR is completed to think about&#13;
&#13;
 where do we go forward with this process.&#13;
&#13;
           But certainly, I think it is going to engage us&#13;
&#13;
 as a Board and management as a whole in putting in place a&#13;
&#13;
 very strong commitment to a process for mainstreaming, to&#13;
&#13;
 get these ideas into the institutional mind set of the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank, the regions and networks who are not yet present&#13;
&#13;
 along that back row but presumably will be in the&#13;

&#13;
 dialogue, to our Bretton Woods partner, the IMF, and to&#13;
&#13;
 many of the other key actors in the development community,&#13;
&#13;
 because I think we wouldn't want this right set of new&#13;
&#13;
 ideas to be stillborn in a sense just to emerge as a very&#13;
&#13;
 elegant document and not get into the mainstream.&#13;
&#13;
             Indeed, what we are seeing is that the 1990s had&#13;
&#13;
 been a very barren period in terms of poverty alleviation,&#13;
&#13;
 not merely because of the failures of the WDR 1990 -- I&#13;
&#13;
 don't want to suggest that -- but because of much larger&#13;
&#13;
 circumstances.    But certainly, I think it is very, very&#13;
&#13;
 important to recognize, just to talk about these ideas is&#13;
&#13;
 one thing, to translate them into the way we function, the&#13;
&#13;
 leadership that we generate I think will be a very&#13;
&#13;
 important part of how we collectively handle this&#13;
&#13;
 document.&#13;
&#13;
             Let me just conclude at that stage, in a sense,&#13;
&#13;
 to say that we endorse the approach paper.          I think it&#13;
&#13;
 reminds us that poverty is an issue about people,&#13;
&#13;
 ordinary, indeed disadvantaged, human beings and I think&#13;
&#13;
 we need to see that sensitivity maintained through the&#13;
&#13;
 document, through the process that we are seeing now and&#13;
&#13;
 critically into the implementation phases.&#13;

             MR. STIGLITZ:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Rivera.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. RIVERA:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             I subscribe to all what my colleagues said about&#13;
&#13;
 the process of the report, but I have some reservations on&#13;
&#13;
 the approach.    It seems very general at the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
             I think that still the neo-classical, orthodox&#13;
&#13;
 economic policy is a reigning paradigm in the world, as it&#13;
&#13;
 is shown by the success of the U.S. economy, the European&#13;
&#13;
 community and all the countries that are applying this&#13;
&#13;
 paradigm.&#13;
&#13;
             I think the report is not clear about that.     It&#13;
&#13;
 says that it is trying to look at some eclectic way of&#13;
&#13;
 approaching poverty, and it is not clear the message.       For&#13;
&#13;
 example, it comes to my mind the thoughts of Douglas&#13;
&#13;
 North, when we were meeting with him three years ago in my&#13;
&#13;
 country, and I asked him what is the difference between&#13;
&#13;
 classical economics and what you are saying.        He told us&#13;
&#13;
 that there was no difference, that his approach was a&#13;
&#13;
 complement of neo-classical economics, to build&#13;
&#13;
 institutions around a very theoretical and abstract model&#13;
&#13;
 that was then in the past decade.&#13;

                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             Then, the other day I talked to Professor Sen,&#13;
&#13;
 and I told him what is the difference in what you are&#13;
&#13;
 saying and what Gary Baker has been saying for a long time&#13;
&#13;
 about health, education, social interactions?            He told me&#13;
&#13;
 we agree in general; we may have some few differences, but&#13;
&#13;
 we agree in general.&#13;
&#13;
             In that sense, I think this report is too&#13;
&#13;
 eclectic.    You know, the World Bank is an institution that&#13;
&#13;
 is heard about all over the world, and the countries&#13;
&#13;
 follow their policies.     And it is very delicate that&#13;
&#13;
 thing.&#13;
&#13;
             What I have in mind is the following:          that this&#13;
&#13;
 report is saying that free markets and liberalization&#13;
&#13;
 probably are good but not now; probably there is a problem&#13;
&#13;
 with sequencing and timing and all of that.            And our&#13;
&#13;
 countries have been accustomed for the last thirty or&#13;
&#13;
 forty years to government intervention.             And there are&#13;
&#13;
 lots of constituencies, not only in the ideological part&#13;
&#13;
 but also in the business communities that are trying to&#13;
&#13;
 reverse all the liberalization policies.&#13;
&#13;
             And if they see all this list of critics about&#13;
&#13;
 liberalization, that is working wrongly and needs to be&#13;
&#13;
 done the other way, they are going to capture again the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 living discussion on policies and they are going to&#13;
&#13;
 reverse what has been advanced with great suffering from&#13;
&#13;
 all of us.&#13;
&#13;
           That is a general point.        And on the process,&#13;
&#13;
 number two, I think it is good to have participation and,&#13;
&#13;
 for example, Professor Schulz [phonetic] in his famous&#13;
&#13;
 book, "Transforming Traditional Agriculture", did this in&#13;
&#13;
 1964 when we went to Guatemala and made an analysis, a&#13;
&#13;
 detailed analysis and consulted the people and he did his&#13;
&#13;
 famous work on transforming traditional agriculture, on&#13;
&#13;
 which he won the Nobel Prize.&#13;
&#13;
           I cannot criticize the whole report, but I am&#13;
&#13;
 going to pick a couple of things in the world of ideas and&#13;
&#13;
 in the world of events.     For example, in the world of&#13;
&#13;
 events, it says that trade liberalization does not work&#13;
&#13;
 well, but, on the other hand, the World Bank has done a&#13;
&#13;
 monumental study on trade liberalization, made by Choksi,&#13;
&#13;
 Papageorgia and Michaeli [phonetic].         And overall, that&#13;
&#13;
 study showed that trade liberalization on balance was&#13;
&#13;
 labor creating, not labor destroying, and that the fastest&#13;
&#13;
 liberalizers were not the slower liberalizers and so on&#13;
&#13;
 and so forth, and nothing is said about this thing in the&#13;
&#13;
 world of events.   That is just an example.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             On the world of ideas, it says that it is a new&#13;
&#13;
 idea where the intra-family allocation of resources.       It&#13;
&#13;
 is not a new idea.    Gary Baker [phonetic] already made an&#13;
&#13;
 article on the use of time and family in 1964, and it is&#13;
&#13;
 not taken here.&#13;
&#13;
             There are lots of things that are said with&#13;
&#13;
 different words but are basically the same as in the good&#13;
&#13;
 old days.    One is that voice and participation have an&#13;
&#13;
 impact on efficiency.     Voice and participation is the same&#13;
&#13;
 as competition; it is exactly the same.&#13;
&#13;
             For example, I would like to see in the report&#13;
&#13;
 to push more for market-friendly approaches to education&#13;
&#13;
 and health, more shared systems and all of that, that&#13;
&#13;
 precisely bring voice and participation to social&#13;
&#13;
 policies.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, there are some omissions in the report,&#13;
&#13;
 I mean very important omissions.        One is that, as Degal&#13;
&#13;
 Johnson [phonetic] wrote in 1964 a famous book called&#13;
&#13;
 "World Agriculture in Disarray", when he mentioned the&#13;
&#13;
 impact on the developing countries of the industrial&#13;
&#13;
 countries' agricultural trade protectionist policies, and&#13;
&#13;
 he discovered there was a long way to go in order to&#13;
&#13;
 reduce poverty if the developed countries liberalized&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 their agricultural policies.      I think this should be&#13;
&#13;
 studied here and should simulate the impact if they&#13;
&#13;
 liberalized their agricultural policies.&#13;
&#13;
           And finally, on labor migration policies, we all&#13;
&#13;
 know that there are segmented markets in the world and a&#13;
&#13;
 more open flow of labor would help to reduce poverty.&#13;

           The outline in the WDR presents at the very&#13;
&#13;
 beginning three voices of the poor.        This appears to me as&#13;
&#13;
 a very adequate start for what follows -- an approach&#13;
&#13;
 based on the voices of the poor followed by a thorough&#13;
&#13;
 analysis of the underlying reasons of poverty and then&#13;
&#13;
 there is on these results the design of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 alleviation strategies on the macro and micro level find&#13;
&#13;
 my full support, even more so, as this approach is&#13;
&#13;
 coherent with the German concept of poverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
            Let me say something in general but especially&#13;
&#13;
 for the tremendous work on what is called consultations&#13;
&#13;
 with the poor, the twenty-three countries' study which&#13;
&#13;
 covers more than 200 poor urban and rural communities, I&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 want to express my deepest appreciation and I had the&#13;
&#13;
 chance yesterday to join the session and I am really&#13;
&#13;
 impressed with what work has been done.&#13;
&#13;
             Perhaps I also find little to disagree with&#13;
&#13;
 because of the numerous fruitful discussions Ravi and his&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues had already with German institutions in the&#13;
&#13;
 preparation process of this paper and its outline&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.    Nevertheless, I want to comment on a few&#13;
&#13;
 aspects which I think need some more clarification or&#13;
&#13;
 rather some more emphasis.&#13;
&#13;
             First, to listen to the voices of the poor is&#13;
&#13;
 one step and it should be the first, but we have to&#13;
&#13;
 consider that it will be impossible to fulfill all the&#13;
&#13;
 vicious perceptions and the like which we will definitely&#13;
&#13;
 receive once we honestly ask them.         Of special importance&#13;
&#13;
 are those with the fundamental relevance for the country's&#13;
&#13;
 development.&#13;
&#13;
             But now we have reached quite a delicate&#13;
&#13;
 question.    Who decides and in which way what is relevant&#13;
&#13;
 or not?   What is the most effective and efficient way to&#13;
&#13;
 reach the overall objective of poverty alleviation?        It&#13;
&#13;
 is, of course, a question of participation, of power or&#13;
&#13;
 influence, of good governance, and it is a question of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 conflict.    The interlinkage and how to solve the evolving&#13;
&#13;
 problems should be given a much stronger focus in the&#13;
&#13;
 paper.&#13;
&#13;
             Second, poverty alleviation should be imbedded&#13;
&#13;
 into a comprehensive and country-specific national&#13;
&#13;
 development strategy and it should be reflected in&#13;
&#13;
 poverty-focused macroeconomic policies.             Poverty&#13;
&#13;
 alleviation should be the main driving force in the&#13;
&#13;
 country's activities like in the World Bank's own work as&#13;
&#13;
 we have intensively discussed it last week.&#13;
&#13;
             But again, I would like to bring up a question.&#13;
&#13;
 Who, for example, to make institutions of the state pro-&#13;
&#13;
 poor and accountable for the poor, as stated in the paper?&#13;
&#13;
 And if we have a much clearer and sharper view on the role&#13;
&#13;
 of inequalities, as also mentioned in the paper, how          do&#13;
&#13;
 we diminish these inequalities and introduce land reforms,&#13;
&#13;
 for example?&#13;
&#13;
             Of course, there is no blueprint, but we should&#13;
&#13;
 definitely think on a fairly practical level, as by the&#13;
&#13;
 way the voices of the poor will be also very practical and&#13;
&#13;
 most likely not theoretical.&#13;
&#13;
             Third, I also missed a stronger focus on the&#13;
&#13;
 gender subject.    To take the different priority mind sets&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 of men and women into consideration is of quite some&#13;
&#13;
 importance as it might lead to very different strategies&#13;
&#13;
 and project designs on the grassroots level.&#13;
&#13;
           And let me add one personal comment, which&#13;
&#13;
 reflects also my experience on the grassroots level.&#13;
&#13;
 Gender is often translated with women; so, the danger&#13;
&#13;
 exists that we design projects for women and only with&#13;
&#13;
 women.   But we then tend to forget that the surrounding is&#13;
&#13;
 still a man-dominated world.      And if I look around we can&#13;
&#13;
 simply say that it is true.&#13;
&#13;
           So, accordingly, segregation is not the solution&#13;
&#13;
 but integration, but an integration which focuses on the&#13;
&#13;
 differences and tries to find a compromise.        However, what&#13;
&#13;
 are we going to do if the only compromises change?&#13;
&#13;
 Empowerment of women means exactly this, a change in the&#13;
&#13;
 man-dominated world.   And, as I have mentioned earlier&#13;
&#13;
 already, the WDR should give stronger emphasis on these&#13;
&#13;
 conflict prone scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
           Equally important, the potential of the poor to&#13;
&#13;
 help themselves should be discussed in more detail.&#13;
&#13;
 Actually, I was a little bit surprised to read about the&#13;
&#13;
 self-employed women's associations and then to realize&#13;
&#13;
 later on that self-help issues are not a topic of their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 own.   Speaking about self-help includes, of course, also&#13;
&#13;
 to look at the underlying power structures and specific&#13;
&#13;
 interests within these groups.&#13;
&#13;
           The role of civil society is also not always&#13;
&#13;
 clear.   Do we speak about civil society as a whole or just&#13;
&#13;
 of groups or of both of it?     In addition, at definition of&#13;
&#13;
 the civil society sector in comparison to private sector&#13;
&#13;
 is not precise enough.&#13;
&#13;
           And then, the causalities stated on page 14,&#13;
&#13;
 where it is mentioned, for example, "rural roads provide&#13;
&#13;
 access to markets which enhances opportunity as well as&#13;
&#13;
 security, which in turn increases bargaining power of the&#13;
&#13;
 poor in local institutions" appears too simplistic to me.&#13;
&#13;
 I could name several reasons that this will not happen.&#13;
&#13;
           And then, the paper says little about the&#13;
&#13;
 realization of the ILO Conventions.        On the other hand, I&#13;
&#13;
 fully support the paper's view on crisis management and&#13;
&#13;
 especially crisis prevention.      But another significant&#13;
&#13;
 aspect which I fear needs some more touch-up is the&#13;
&#13;
 monitoring of effects.    We discussed that earlier last&#13;
&#13;
 week and the question of useful indicators in the&#13;
&#13;
 collection of data, so I do not want to repeat it here.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             The paper does not specifically refer to the&#13;
&#13;
 development goals set by the Development Assistance&#13;
&#13;
 Committee for the year 2015 and what it needs to be done&#13;
&#13;
 for that realization.       This is closely linked to the 2020&#13;
&#13;
 initiative, which is also spelled out in the paper, and I&#13;
&#13;
 think that should be included.&#13;
&#13;
             In addition, the discussion within the UN about&#13;
&#13;
 the standardization of social indicators and especially&#13;
&#13;
 the breakthrough on the ECOSOC meeting in May this year&#13;
&#13;
 should be taken into consideration.         Here also, our own&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank guidelines for social policy should be somehow&#13;
&#13;
 included.&#13;
&#13;
             And finally, in Chapter 10 on page 21, the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 Initiative should be an integral part of the international&#13;
&#13;
 dimension, especially those aspects we just discussed last&#13;
&#13;
 week concerning the paper "Strengthening the Link Between&#13;
&#13;
 Debt Relief and Poverty Reduction".&#13;
&#13;
             Okay, that is it for now, but I want to thank&#13;

&#13;
           We like this outline very much.          We like the&#13;
&#13;
 general approach of the paper and especially the emphasis&#13;
&#13;
 on the three issues -- empowerment, security and&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
           Like my Canadian colleague, I think we also feel&#13;
&#13;
 that the process leading up to this report is at least as&#13;
&#13;
 important as the end product itself.        And I think this is&#13;
&#13;
 manifested through us being part of financing and&#13;
&#13;
 arranging some of the consultations and workshops that we&#13;
&#13;
 have had and will be having over the next year.&#13;
&#13;
           I too was privileged to sit in and listen on the&#13;
&#13;
 consultations with the poor exercise yesterday, not as&#13;
&#13;
 much as I would have liked, but at least I got a feel for&#13;
&#13;
 some of the conclusions that can be drawn from these&#13;
&#13;
 consultations.&#13;
&#13;
           And I must say I too, like my German colleague,&#13;
&#13;
 was impressed by the wealth of information that has come&#13;
&#13;
 out of these consultations.&#13;
&#13;
           Now if you want to be nasty, you could obviously&#13;
&#13;
 say that these consultations should have taken place a&#13;
&#13;
 long time ago.   I mean, the Bank has been criticized for&#13;
&#13;
 not listening enough to the poor in the past, but we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 certainly feel that it is better late than never, and we&#13;
&#13;
 very much encourage this process.&#13;
&#13;
            Two important questions come to mind in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 these consultations.   The first one is:           How do we ensure&#13;
&#13;
 that these consultations become mainstreamed as a more&#13;
&#13;
 long-term participatory process in the Bank's work in&#13;
&#13;
 general?   I.e., how do we make sure that this is just not&#13;
&#13;
 a one-off exercise?&#13;
&#13;
            And secondly, how do we ensure that the&#13;
&#13;
 conclusions from the consultations get reflected in the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank's operations and in the Bank's strategies?           I think&#13;
&#13;
 these are two crucial issues that we would like to have&#13;
&#13;
 elaborated on in the WDR.&#13;
&#13;
            A few other areas where I think at least looking&#13;
&#13;
 at the outline we are seeing some weaknesses and we would&#13;
&#13;
 like to hear comments on whether this will be made more&#13;
&#13;
 clear or not in the end report as such.            The first one is&#13;
&#13;
 on environment and poverty.&#13;
&#13;
            We think that just judging from the outline, the&#13;
&#13;
 analysis seems to be weak on the links between environment&#13;
&#13;
 and poverty and the challenge of finding a balance between&#13;
&#13;
 immediate poverty reduction and long-term environmental&#13;
&#13;
 sustainability deserves to be addressed in more depth,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 reflecting the complexity involved attempting to prove&#13;
&#13;
 causalities between environmental sustainability and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.&#13;
&#13;
            And we know obviously that there is a whole lot&#13;
&#13;
 of experience to be drawn upon and a lot of existing&#13;
&#13;
 material that we would like to see reflected in the&#13;
&#13;
 report.&#13;
&#13;
            The second issue is on children and poverty.&#13;
&#13;
 Judging from the outline, we cannot see explicit&#13;
&#13;
 references to this complex question.        Children and young&#13;
&#13;
 people do experience the accumulated effects of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 due to their marginalized social position, and their&#13;
&#13;
 problems, needs and priorities and interests differ from&#13;
&#13;
 those of adults and, therefore, we feel that special&#13;
&#13;
 measures are required to accommodate children and young&#13;
&#13;
 people of both sexes in poverty analysis and poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction practices.&#13;
&#13;
            A third issue which we find is important and&#13;
&#13;
 where we would like to hear comments is on the&#13;
&#13;
 interrelationship between the global agenda, the&#13;
&#13;
 international commitments and country level poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction.   We feel we need to look in-depth into the&#13;
&#13;
 implications of the international commitments of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 countries themselves in relation to their national poverty&#13;
&#13;
 strategies.   And I think poverty should not and cannot be&#13;
&#13;
 addressed by the countries in isolation but the rights and&#13;
&#13;
 responsibilities as manifest in international commitments&#13;
&#13;
 provide an important framework for a national poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction process.&#13;
&#13;
            And I think a crucial element here is obviously&#13;
&#13;
 how to ensure national ownership of these processes.&#13;
&#13;
 Linked to this is the question of why and how some states&#13;
&#13;
 do end up pursuing poverty reduction strategies and others&#13;
&#13;
 don't.    I think a discussion of this would also be&#13;
&#13;
 interesting to have in the report.&#13;
&#13;
            And finally, on operationalization.      Obviously,&#13;
&#13;
 the biggest challenge for us is how to operationalize the&#13;
&#13;
 conclusions from the report in general into the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 work.    And I think what we are wondering is obviously the&#13;
&#13;
 Board has quite recently approved a poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy for the Bank, and that is a strategy which we are&#13;
&#13;
 very pleased with, but we would expect that also after the&#13;
&#13;
 WDR we will go more in-depth into looking at the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 strategy in this area based on the findings from the&#13;
&#13;
 report.   And we are interested in hearing what the plans&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 are after the report and how this will link up with the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy that we just have endorsed.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. STIGLITZ:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Ms. Zou.&#13;
&#13;
             MS. ZOU:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             I too very much appreciate this outline.      I&#13;
&#13;
 think it contains a lot of important thinking.        It is very&#13;
&#13;
 much thoughtful and very much enlightening.         And I don't&#13;
&#13;
 really feel that the general tone of this outline would be&#13;
&#13;
 some sort of subversion to the neo-classical economics.&#13;
&#13;
             But I would feel that it is actually a very&#13;
&#13;
 useful complement to it.     As a matter of fact, you know,&#13;
&#13;
 this world is a complicated one.        We cannot address all&#13;
&#13;
 the problems in this world by a single school of academic&#13;
&#13;
 thinking.    We do need various fresh thinking in economics&#13;
&#13;
 which is different from the neo-classical economics, but&#13;
&#13;
 it doesn't really mean that we are going to come back to&#13;
&#13;
 the days of the centrally-planned economy.&#13;
&#13;
             Having said this, I have a couple of&#13;
&#13;
 observations.    First, on the trilogy approach, we approach&#13;
&#13;
 this new approach very much.       It contains a focus on three&#13;
&#13;
 elements -- empowerment, security and opportunity.        I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 understand the authors' arguments that these three&#13;
&#13;
 elements are basically on an equal footing and there is no&#13;
&#13;
 hierarchy among them.&#13;
&#13;
           However, I would look at it a little bit&#13;
&#13;
 differently on this point.      I would feel that there is a&#13;
&#13;
 certain degree of hierarchy among the three, because in my&#13;
&#13;
 view the opportunity would be the most fundamental one&#13;
&#13;
 among the three, and then followed by security and then&#13;
&#13;
 the empowerment.&#13;
&#13;
           Take the relationship between opportunity and&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment as an example.      My view is that the&#13;
&#13;
 fundamental power is actually the power of access to and&#13;
&#13;
 allocate the resources.     So the powerless is rooted in&#13;
&#13;
 economic inequality.    Even in the developed countries, the&#13;
&#13;
 poor are still relatively powerless because they cannot&#13;
&#13;
 afford to run a newspaper, they cannot afford to lobby the&#13;
&#13;
 parliament; they cannot afford to have access to the&#13;
&#13;
 Internet, and they don't have money to finance NGOs.     So,&#13;
&#13;
 in poor countries, I think such a situation would be even&#13;
&#13;
 worse.&#13;
&#13;
           Therefore, I would feel that, as a matter of&#13;
&#13;
 fact, the economic intervention in developing countries&#13;
&#13;
 could be the most effective way to address the issue of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, for example, to provide opportunity to the&#13;
&#13;
 poor in education, access to resources and access to&#13;
&#13;
 information.    That will contribute tremendously to the&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment of the poor.     And I think in this area the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank could have a great value-added.&#13;
&#13;
             But by saying so, I don't mean to have prejudice&#13;
&#13;
 to the institutional arrangement for the participation of&#13;
&#13;
 the poor.    I would join my colleagues to appreciate that&#13;
&#13;
 directly talking to the poor approach of this WDR.&#13;
&#13;
             However, for this institutional intervention to&#13;
&#13;
 be effective and sustainable, I feel that that will&#13;
&#13;
 require the overall society transformation, that means the&#13;
&#13;
 societies should be partial from some sort of prevailing&#13;
&#13;
 money-talking logic.&#13;
&#13;
             I think we do need idealism which is we have to&#13;
&#13;
 embrace the market economy, but not a market society, as&#13;
&#13;
 stated by the French Minister of Finance.           However, this&#13;
&#13;
 is a big topic.    I am afraid that this is a question yet&#13;
&#13;
 to be solved in this world.&#13;
&#13;
             So, on this aspect regarding the operational&#13;
&#13;
 implications to the World Bank, I would feel that we have&#13;
&#13;
 to be cautious in this area.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             And number two, on the departure from false&#13;
&#13;
 dichotomies, I would fully concur with the ideas to reject&#13;
&#13;
 a couple of false dichotomies, especially the one&#13;
&#13;
 regarding the growth and redistribution.&#13;
&#13;
             However, here, I would like to mention one&#13;
&#13;
 question.    When talking about distribution pattern in this&#13;
&#13;
 world, I would like to bring your attention to an issue&#13;
&#13;
 that is a different rate of return in different factors of&#13;
&#13;
 production.    Because it seems to me that over the recent&#13;
&#13;
 years there is a trend of low rate of return in the labor&#13;
&#13;
 force.&#13;
&#13;
             Of course, it is also a two-edged sword.&#13;
&#13;
 Because of the low cost of labor force, the developing&#13;
&#13;
 countries do benefit from it, because it is good for them&#13;
&#13;
 to increase the competitiveness in the labor-intensive&#13;
&#13;
 industry.    However, as far as the poverty is concerned,&#13;
&#13;
 the distribution to the poor, I would think that this may&#13;
&#13;
 not be good news to the poor because the labor force is&#13;
&#13;
 the abundant asset of the poor.        And somebody said that,&#13;
&#13;
 given the pattern of supply and demand of the labor force&#13;
&#13;
 in this world, the long-term productivity, marginal&#13;
&#13;
 productivity of labor would be close to zero.       I am not&#13;
&#13;
 sure whether this is true or not, but I would think if it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 is true, then it would have very serious implications to&#13;
&#13;
 the poverty in this world.     So I would invite some&#13;
&#13;
 academic thinking or discussion on this aspect in this&#13;
&#13;
 paper.&#13;
&#13;
           Thirdly, on the international dimensions, I&#13;
&#13;
 would thank staff to include this part in the WDR because&#13;
&#13;
 we feel the poverty has to be addressed in national and&#13;
&#13;
 international levels alike.&#13;
&#13;
           I would mention two issues here.         The first is&#13;
&#13;
 the implication of the oligopoly trend in developed&#13;
&#13;
 countries to the developing countries, because we all know&#13;
&#13;
 that the major benefit of the market liberalization is to&#13;
&#13;
 encourage the market competition and medium and small&#13;
&#13;
 enterprises and to achieve labor-intensive growth in the&#13;
&#13;
 developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
           However, with such sort of a trend of merging in&#13;
&#13;
 these developed countries' industries, like information&#13;
&#13;
 industry, manufacturing industry and financial industry,&#13;
&#13;
 the developing countries have to consider with this trend&#13;
&#13;
 of oligopoly, how they can benefit from the open market to&#13;
&#13;
 the outside world.   I would like the report to give some&#13;
&#13;
 thinking on this aspect.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             And secondly, on the aid effectiveness, the&#13;
&#13;
 paper pointed out that the one factor effect, the aid&#13;
&#13;
 effectiveness is the policy of the recipient countries.         I&#13;
&#13;
 fully agree with this, but I think here two questions have&#13;
&#13;
 to be asked.&#13;
&#13;
             Number one is:    How to judge if a policy is good&#13;
&#13;
 or bad in one country?       Whether it should be judged by a&#13;
&#13;
 certain sort of international standard or certain sort of&#13;
&#13;
 economic thinking or rather judged by its effectiveness in&#13;
&#13;
 the specific context in this country and the results on&#13;
&#13;
 the ground.&#13;
&#13;
             The second question is the right policy in&#13;
&#13;
 recipient countries is not the only factor which&#13;
&#13;
 determines aid effectiveness.       I think another important&#13;
&#13;
 factor is the contradiction from the donor side, that is&#13;
&#13;
 the conflict between the development assistance as a need&#13;
&#13;
 for poverty reduction and the development assistance as a&#13;
&#13;
 tool for the donors' strategic diplomatic and political&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.    I think we have to address this issue as well.&#13;
&#13;
             And finally, I have a minor suggestion that I&#13;
&#13;
 think probably it would be useful to strengthen the&#13;
&#13;
 empirical part of this report a little bit, probably in&#13;
&#13;

           It is an attempt to react to the quotation.      I&#13;
&#13;
 was not there.   I think it was during your visit in&#13;
&#13;
 Europe.   So you know what more than I do in what was said&#13;
&#13;
 exactly by Mr. Stroskan [phonetic], but I think it is the&#13;
&#13;
 global reaction to the paper also that we very much&#13;
&#13;
 welcome the cautious way in applying the comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
 approach, somehow saying that we have to look at a more&#13;
&#13;
 complex world and also have a more complex approach, which&#13;
&#13;
 goes beyond economics of poverty reduction and from this&#13;
&#13;
 standpoint we very much support the trilogy of&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, security and opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
           Just to comment on an article by the President&#13;
&#13;
 and Joe in The Financial Times.       I think it was yesterday.&#13;
&#13;
 The difficulty will be to deal between complexity and&#13;
&#13;
 action and not stay in a position to contemplate&#13;
&#13;
 complexity but also find ways to act because if we just&#13;
&#13;
 look at what is happening, it will be too late.      And this&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 may be one of the major challenges of the WDR going&#13;
&#13;
 forward, to somehow make the step of the analysis towards&#13;
&#13;
 action and implementation of a proposed strategy.      It has&#13;
&#13;
 been mentioned by other chairs.       I will come back on that&#13;
&#13;
 a bit later.&#13;
&#13;
            So, we globally support the approach.     Just some&#13;
&#13;
 additional comments on maybe further steps in the work to&#13;
&#13;
 be done.&#13;
&#13;
            The first one is some uneasiness with how we&#13;
&#13;
 deal with what could be described as a switch of the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank's discourse on poverty compared to literature and&#13;
&#13;
 ideas which have been floating around in the last twenty&#13;
&#13;
 years.   It has been mentioned also by John Sinclair.     Some&#13;
&#13;
 common sense approaches which are in this paper and which&#13;
&#13;
 are very welcome were also put forward by other&#13;
&#13;
 institutions or other researchers.&#13;
&#13;
            And I think we have to be careful first in&#13;
&#13;
 recognizing that some trends are not new trends but have&#13;
&#13;
 been there for a long time, and also that it implies that&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank has accepted to change a little bit its&#13;
&#13;
 discourse.   So, it may be a different exercise, but we&#13;
&#13;
 have to recognize that, and maybe be clearer in saying,&#13;
&#13;
 yes, it has been said by others, and we have learned.      And&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 it means that we have to change the way we are doing&#13;
&#13;
 business, maybe being more candid in the acceptance of&#13;
&#13;
 this shift, which is not to be presented as scientific or&#13;
&#13;
 ideological but as a very pragmatic approach and facing&#13;
&#13;
 reality and what has happened in the last years.&#13;
&#13;
           But we very much welcome these comments and this&#13;
&#13;
 approach, and it is necessary to have the appropriate&#13;
&#13;
 theoretical background to justify it.          And it leads me to&#13;
&#13;
 my second point.&#13;
&#13;
           It is clear that some of the approaches proposed&#13;
&#13;
 in the paper will create resistance within the&#13;
&#13;
 institution, outside the institution.          So, it is very&#13;
&#13;
 important in our view that the approach is very strong and&#13;
&#13;
 robust so that it can prepare itself to this resistance or&#13;
&#13;
 contradiction by what some would call old-age economics.&#13;
&#13;
 I don't know how to describe that.&#13;
&#13;
           So, it means that for the Bank it must go beyond&#13;
&#13;
 fashion, and we have to be very careful about that, not to&#13;
&#13;
 go in the direction of purely fashion and say, okay,&#13;
&#13;
 poverty assessment and participatory processes.         We have&#13;
&#13;
 to have good pillars for bringing that forward and also be&#13;
&#13;
 very strong.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           So comments on this idea.        The idea of voices of&#13;
&#13;
 the poor has been welcomed by several speakers, and we&#13;
&#13;
 fully agree with that.    But it is necessary, maybe not&#13;
&#13;
 sufficient, and maybe if I can make a comparison with what&#13;
&#13;
 I could call an experimental process or what Ms. Zou has&#13;
&#13;
 just described as empirical facts.        It is necessary to&#13;
&#13;
 come to the reality and take some distance and try to feed&#13;
&#13;
 that in a more conceptual framework and also confronting&#13;
&#13;
 that with what we have said for the last years before&#13;
&#13;
 coming back and making sure that the conceptual framework&#13;
&#13;
 we have is consistent with what is being said.&#13;
&#13;
           And sometimes just sticking to voices of poor as&#13;
&#13;
 a quotation might be dangerous.       If I remember well, in&#13;
&#13;
 Michael Walton's paper there was something about the&#13;
&#13;
 distance to be taken sometimes, because just looking at&#13;
&#13;
 it, it could be short-sighted.      There are other dimensions&#13;
&#13;
 which are sometimes difficult to incorporate in the&#13;
&#13;
 reasoning.   Anna Brandt has mentioned environment.       I am&#13;
&#13;
 not sure that environment as a public good, for example,&#13;
&#13;
 is fully taken on by the poor we are listening to.&#13;
&#13;
           So, this back and forth process will be very&#13;
&#13;
 important in our view to strengthen the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           The second question related to how do we deal&#13;
&#13;
 with voices of the poor.      If I well understood my German&#13;
&#13;
 colleague, it isn't the question of the who.          If I take it&#13;
&#13;
 from the French side, I would say who is in charge of&#13;
&#13;
 public interest?    And is it directly civil society?          Do we&#13;
&#13;
 have institutions which are in place and who have the&#13;
&#13;
 legitimacy to express public interest?           Do we go directly&#13;
&#13;
 to the poor or do we consider that the processes in place&#13;
&#13;
 are sufficient enough so that we can deal with&#13;
&#13;
 representatives?&#13;
&#13;
           And the further we will go into political&#13;
&#13;
 economy, the more we will have to be careful with that.&#13;
&#13;
 So that we also listen to the global picture.          Maybe Ms.&#13;
&#13;
 Zou was close to that idea in saying that some aspects&#13;
&#13;
 will imply society transformation.          And on society&#13;
&#13;
 transformation, we have to be clear on the fact that we&#13;
&#13;
 have a global picture of all the interest, having listened&#13;
&#13;
 to it verbally but also anticipating the resistance when&#13;
&#13;
 it will come.&#13;
&#13;
           Maybe you could say some words on that.            It is&#13;
&#13;
 all the more important as I think it is in the description&#13;
&#13;
 of the potential of Chapter 1 when we are dealing with&#13;
&#13;
 values and norms.    There are contradictions, potential&#13;
&#13;

                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 conflicts around these ideas, and it is not to say we&#13;
&#13;
 shouldn't go there; it is very important for us to go&#13;
&#13;
 there, and I think it is one of the important dimensions&#13;
&#13;
 of the work proposed.    But it means that we have to be&#13;
&#13;
 very strong because questions will be raised on what is&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank doing there.    And, yes, the WDR is more than a&#13;
&#13;
 Bank paper, but it is also a Bank paper.           So, we have to&#13;
&#13;
 be careful.&#13;
&#13;
            And when it comes to implementation, it means&#13;
&#13;
 that we have to be clear also on how this should be done,&#13;
&#13;
 by whom it should be done and on a country base.          So, it&#13;
&#13;
 is some question, but it means that we are coming in some&#13;
&#13;
 uncharted areas, at least from the Bank point of view, and&#13;
&#13;
 that we have to be very robust on the way we put them&#13;
&#13;
 forward, also to ensure ownership by the countries&#13;
&#13;
 concerned.&#13;
&#13;
            The second question relates to mainstreaming.&#13;
&#13;
 It has been mentioned by several colleagues.          I think we&#13;
&#13;
 have to careful to keep clear on what is the purpose of&#13;
&#13;
 the WDR.   It is not a Bank strategy, but it is a more&#13;
&#13;
 global analysis with a stock-taking part, as mentioned by&#13;
&#13;
 Ravi at the outset, an analysis part, and putting on the&#13;
&#13;
 table some major principles for the years coming.&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            But it is right to say that we will have to be&#13;
&#13;
 careful and the fact that this is doable for the&#13;
&#13;
 institution which will be in charge, and that there is&#13;
&#13;
 enough on the forward-looking part so that we know how to&#13;
&#13;
 manage.&#13;
&#13;
            It also implies that in the Bank works in the&#13;
&#13;
 coming years or at the moment, we have to be very careful&#13;
&#13;
 on the consistency of what we are discussing.          We&#13;
&#13;
 discussed recently the papers on poverty reduction, HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 and the more global coming from Michael.           I think this one&#13;
&#13;
 seems to be fully in phase with the current thinking in&#13;
&#13;
 the WDR.&#13;
&#13;
            Now other papers discussed at the moment within&#13;
&#13;
 the institution such as social protection, social&#13;
&#13;
 dimensions of crisis, et cetera, we are not fully sure&#13;
&#13;
 that all these works are consistent, I mean, on the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy side and that what is being done by the regions,&#13;
&#13;
 as was mentioned earlier, is also fully consistent.&#13;
&#13;
            So, it is not to reduce the purpose of the WDR&#13;
&#13;
 but to make sure that the institution has a consistent&#13;
&#13;
 discourse outside.   And the more we will go into&#13;
&#13;
 participatory processes, the more we will have to be very&#13;
&#13;
 careful in making sure that it all fits together.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           The last point -- and I hope it will not be&#13;
&#13;
 badly taken -- the question of better late than never --&#13;
&#13;
 well, to put it that way -- but we also have to be careful&#13;
&#13;
 not to give the feeling that the Bank is discovering what&#13;
&#13;
 is poverty.   It means that we have to be very careful on&#13;
&#13;
 what we put behind the words, what are the poor, what do&#13;
&#13;
 we mean exactly by participatory processes, what is civil&#13;
&#13;
 society, as has been said earlier.&#13;
&#13;
           But I am not sure of the U.S. English words, but&#13;
&#13;
 "il ne faut pas etre trop naif", and it is not to be&#13;
&#13;
 cynical, but the Bank has been working in developing&#13;
&#13;
 countries for years, many people have been on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
 I hope they all know what is happening and in our schools&#13;
&#13;
 where teachers are not there, where it is difficult for&#13;
&#13;
 parents to send their children to school because they&#13;
&#13;
 don't have the money.&#13;
&#13;
           So maybe take some distance also from that, and&#13;
&#13;
 not to give the feeling that we are discovering all of&#13;
&#13;
 this.   It is very good to give the feeling that we are&#13;
&#13;
 completely in this reality check, and that is very&#13;
&#13;
 important.    But the way we are doing it should be such&#13;
&#13;
 that it does not give weapons for the contradictors to say&#13;
&#13;
 to the institution, well, it is pure fashion.&#13;

           That is all.    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STIGLITZ:    Those are good warnings.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Singh.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SINGH:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I would begin with the importance of a report&#13;
&#13;
 like this.   And I do see that this report, which is at the&#13;
&#13;
 center of what we do in the World Bank, is going to be of&#13;
&#13;
 great significance, not only to the World Bank, not only&#13;
&#13;
 to the Directors here, but also to countries which have&#13;
&#13;
 large segments of poor people.&#13;
&#13;
           And this report also has to have a meaning for&#13;
&#13;
 the poor themselves.     In many ways -- and I think in&#13;
&#13;
 significant ways -- this report should be a mirror in&#13;
&#13;
 which a country could look at itself and see whether what&#13;
&#13;
 it is doing is a step in the direction of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           I also know that this report is going to be&#13;
&#13;
 widely read by scholars, by NGOs, by concerned citizens&#13;
&#13;
 and by members of the civil society.        I know that the&#13;
&#13;
 author of this report, Ravi himself, is an eminent&#13;
&#13;
 economist.   My advice, however, should be that he need not&#13;
&#13;
 carry the cultural baggage too heavily so that this report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 becomes only the delight of the economists and relevant&#13;
&#13;
 with us.&#13;
&#13;
            Then, it would cease to be a mirror; it would&#13;
&#13;
 cease to be a mirror in which you can see and ponder over&#13;
&#13;
 what you do.&#13;
&#13;
            Having said that, Mr. Chairman, my constituency&#13;
&#13;
 is one of those areas which has the largest number of&#13;
&#13;
 poor.   So, I was looking at it, as a civil servant working&#13;
&#13;
 in the districts, having come from a village myself,&#13;
&#13;
 having seen poverty from very close quarters, having had&#13;
&#13;
 the responsibility to remove poverty in several&#13;
&#13;
 assignments directly.      I felt what had gone wrong because&#13;
&#13;
 there was a hope that by the end of the century we won't&#13;
&#13;
 have poor people.    But poor people still have increased.&#13;
&#13;
            I came across a reference which I thought I&#13;
&#13;
 would mention today, and I was trying to find out what was&#13;
&#13;
 the secret of Mahatma Gandhi, not because he is from&#13;
&#13;
 India, but he is definitely one of the tallest persons&#13;
&#13;
 that we have produced in this world in the century.             And&#13;
&#13;
 how could he relate himself to the poor?&#13;
&#13;
            It was it practice, which is well known, to have&#13;
&#13;
 a morning prayer from where he read out from the&#13;
&#13;
 scriptures and an evening prayer again.              But the only song&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 that he composed from out of his experience in South&#13;
&#13;
 Africa and in India, I happened to see that song, but it&#13;
&#13;
 is a song which is not much referred to.           And he went to&#13;
&#13;
 the morning prayer after singing that song which he had&#13;
&#13;
 composed -- he used to keep it secret; I don't know why he&#13;
&#13;
 kept it so secret, and I also don't know why it was not&#13;
&#13;
 publicized by the scholars -- and in the song, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, he said that God give me all the strength to&#13;
&#13;
 live like a poor man.&#13;
&#13;
           I couldn't understand that.        The second sentence&#13;
&#13;
 is even more powerful.    And he said God give me all the&#13;
&#13;
 strength to think like a poor man.        And, therefore, I was&#13;
&#13;
 very happy with the two things of this report.          The first&#13;
&#13;
 is that we start with the voice of the poor.          Select&#13;
&#13;
 people who record that voice, who could relate themselves&#13;
&#13;
 to the poor.   And that is crucial.&#13;
&#13;
           And more than the voice, to find out, to get&#13;
&#13;
 reflected in this report, how the poor think.          And that&#13;
&#13;
 would give this report a kind of a strength which would be&#13;
&#13;
 in my view unique.&#13;
&#13;
           I am also very happy with the sub-title of this&#13;
&#13;
 report, Attacking Poverty.     It is a good language of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 warfare.   But having said that, I find that this report&#13;
&#13;
 has to reflect a couple of things, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            One is that country-wide, because we are&#13;
&#13;
 national governments, we have to know clearly which are&#13;
&#13;
 the endemic areas of poverty in a country, in a region, in&#13;
&#13;
 a state, in a district.    And what is that culture of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty which keeps them down in terms of heritage,&#13;
&#13;
 traditions and all that we have got?        But most important,&#13;
&#13;
 and that is reflected in this approach paper, is the kind&#13;
&#13;
 of skills that we can provide to them.&#13;
&#13;
            The second aspect is the primary responsibility&#13;
&#13;
 for poverty reduction is that of the national government.&#13;
&#13;
 This point has to be there.     And we must in the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
 have that humility that we are going to help the national&#13;
&#13;
 government.&#13;
&#13;
            But my suggestion to the frameworkers of this&#13;
&#13;
 report is that the responsibility of the national&#13;
&#13;
 government finds a reference in the chapter dealing with&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment; more clearly, where it says, Chapter 4 of&#13;
&#13;
 Part 2, that is empowerment, institutions of the state and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
            While there are separate chapters on&#13;
&#13;
 international dimensions, I would suggest that there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 should be a separate chapter on national dimensions or&#13;
&#13;
 whatever language you want to put.         And the responsibility&#13;
&#13;
 of the national government must be clearly stipulated in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of all that we are required to do.&#13;
&#13;
             I am deeply conscious of the fact that the&#13;
&#13;
 national development strategy is carried away by certain&#13;
&#13;
 vested interests, and that defeats poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 programs.&#13;
&#13;
             In large areas of South Asia, I know the&#13;
&#13;
 contractors groups have come up.        Even if you need&#13;
&#13;
 irrigation channels, they will construct roads, because&#13;
&#13;
 they know how to construct roads.        Even if you need&#13;
&#13;
 schools, they will buy equipment because they know how to&#13;
&#13;
 buy equipment.    That subversion is taking place, and that&#13;
&#13;
 is the gross misutilization of scarce resources.&#13;
&#13;
             And, therefore, I would like to suggest that the&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank's programs and this report in particular should&#13;
&#13;
 pay a special emphasis on governance in the most crucial&#13;
&#13;
 aspect of governance besides going for education of the&#13;
&#13;
 poor, which is crucial, which is primary, which needs a&#13;
&#13;
 special focus if poverty has to be reduced, because it is&#13;
&#13;
 our global experience, experience which relates to each&#13;
&#13;
 country that illiterates are not reached anywhere and the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 skilled are not reached anywhere in the world, and the&#13;
&#13;
 skilled and educated are not poor anyway.&#13;
&#13;
           And that focus has to be there.          And, therefore,&#13;
&#13;
 Mr. Chairman, I would commend for the frameworkers of the&#13;
&#13;
 report that there should be training provisions, elaborate&#13;
&#13;
 training provisions, not that everybody has to be shifted&#13;
&#13;
 to Washington, but locally accepted training institutions&#13;
&#13;
 for leaders, planners, workers and the poor and the joint&#13;
&#13;
 training programs, joint communication.&#13;
&#13;
           At the end I have a submission to make for the&#13;
&#13;
 frameworkers of this report, and that is the message has&#13;
&#13;
 to be of hope, because this is very crucial if we have to&#13;
&#13;
 keep peace in this world, which is not to bluff people&#13;
&#13;
 and, therefore, the message has to be hope with sincerity&#13;
&#13;
 of purpose.&#13;
&#13;
           And if we succeed in doing that, we would&#13;
&#13;
 succeed, as I said in the beginning, making this&#13;
&#13;
 forthcoming report a mirror in which we can see ourselves.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
           There have been some excellent interventions&#13;
&#13;
 this morning.   So, I will try and move quickly through my&#13;
&#13;
 more limited points and referring to what others have&#13;
&#13;
 said.&#13;
&#13;
           I guess I heard something that Jean Pesme said&#13;
&#13;
 on the question of the overall approach and the use of the&#13;
&#13;
 voices of the poor.   So, to refer back to what he said,&#13;
&#13;
 then we think it is a very good approach overall, and I&#13;
&#13;
 guess it is a very basic cautionary issue of putting some&#13;
&#13;
 distance between what you hear directly from your survey&#13;
&#13;
 field work and your overall conclusions.           It is a basic&#13;
&#13;
 methodological point.    So, I don't think you really needed&#13;
&#13;
 to hear it, but just an overall note of caution that we&#13;
&#13;
 have some interesting anecdotes that you will get from&#13;
&#13;
 quotations and how do you really infer a b roader message&#13;
&#13;
 from that.&#13;
&#13;
           I should have actually begun by saying that we&#13;
&#13;
 like the overall way that you are doing this.          So, I tend&#13;
&#13;
 to focus on the things that we don't like so much.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it would be useful actually to&#13;
&#13;
 concentrate more on what worked from the previous WDR, the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy that we had.    I think that you are doing that&#13;
&#13;
 somewhat and I would imagine again in full text you will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 come out more, but just to push along in that direction&#13;
&#13;
 before throwing out the 1990 approach and holding you&#13;
&#13;
 personally responsible for your contribution to that, then&#13;
&#13;
 I think that some things did happen well, although we are&#13;
&#13;
 left with a challenge that we look at the poverty numbers&#13;
&#13;
 around the world and we don't see tremendous success,&#13;
&#13;
 which is a general question, and also tremendous&#13;
&#13;
 frustration for this institution.&#13;
&#13;
           Also again, coming back to the link between what&#13;
&#13;
 is this document versus what is the Bank as an&#13;
&#13;
 institution.   And someone else made the point that this is&#13;
&#13;
 not simply a Bank strategy yet.       We are an institution&#13;
&#13;
 which is in the forefront of carrying through the lessons&#13;
&#13;
 which have been learned and not to try and twist this into&#13;
&#13;
 what would the World Bank do now, but thinking about how&#13;
&#13;
 we will have to be responsible for implementing the&#13;
&#13;
 findings from the report.&#13;
&#13;
           I am talking in this case about the question of&#13;
&#13;
 selectivity which we are always going on and on about, the&#13;
&#13;
 need to focus on what the World Bank can do versus what we&#13;
&#13;
 should be sharing the responsibility with others that are&#13;
&#13;
 better placed.&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           So, when you say that the need to look at the&#13;
&#13;
 new approach is one of empowerment, security and&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity, we think that that seems interesting, but it&#13;
&#13;
 also sounds like everything.      And I am not about to say&#13;
&#13;
 which one is more important than the next, but what will&#13;
&#13;
 the World Bank be choosing to do?       Not only should we&#13;
&#13;
 focus on what the World Bank can do but before you look at&#13;
&#13;
 the whole range of everything that poverty is in a&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive way, what does that really mean, the&#13;
&#13;
 question about -- how did you phrase it -- action versus&#13;
&#13;
 complexity, confronting complexity?        Maybe it was Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Wolfensohn that said it that way now.         I am not sure.&#13;
&#13;
           So, on some additional details, there is an&#13;
&#13;
 implication in terms of flexibility that the donors should&#13;
&#13;
 get off their high horses or their particular interests&#13;
&#13;
 and allow the technicians to move forward with that.&#13;
&#13;
 Maybe I am misreading that.&#13;
&#13;
           But the question is the link with&#13;
&#13;
 conditionality.   And I don't mean in such a heavy-handed&#13;
&#13;
 way what we will impose upon the borrowers, but rather&#13;
&#13;
 when the institutions come and they speak to the&#13;
&#13;
 governments and they say this is what we really think you&#13;
&#13;
 have to be doing; this is what the empirical results from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the rest of the world show and country-specific results.&#13;
&#13;
 It is important to be strong, and there is a certain&#13;
&#13;
 implication that we are reading in this that we might be&#13;
&#13;
 moving away from keeping a strong message that says, okay,&#13;
&#13;
 this is our best advice to you as the government and you&#13;
&#13;
 really ought to be following it.&#13;
&#13;
           There is then the question of ownership, and&#13;
&#13;
 this is sort of tied into the point I just made.         What&#13;
&#13;
 does ownership really mean?     And coming back to the point&#13;
&#13;
 about empowerment, you know, even in my own country I&#13;
&#13;
 won't hesitate to say that when you look at questions like&#13;
&#13;
 voter participation, you see clearly that I think this&#13;
&#13;
 country will come up with some very different political&#13;
&#13;
 decisions if we had a broader participation in the&#13;
&#13;
 electoral process, but it doesn't happen.          And why doesn't&#13;
&#13;
 it happen?   It doesn't happen for a number of reasons.&#13;
&#13;
 Poverty is one of the reasons and politics is another one&#13;
&#13;
 of the reasons.&#13;
&#13;
           And I suppose we ought to be a little careful --&#13;
&#13;
 I think Jean said it as well -- about realizing the&#13;
&#13;
 problems that we are going to face as an institution if we&#13;
&#13;
 rush in and say we have discovered what the problem is;&#13;
&#13;
 the problem is the poor and not empowered because, of&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 course, that is the problem and now what do we do as an&#13;
&#13;
 institution about that.&#13;
&#13;
           A few points in the document.            I don't want to&#13;
&#13;
 pick a fight with China here, honestly.            But we are little&#13;
&#13;
 puzzled by the comparison between China and Russia insofar&#13;
&#13;
 as the discussion of liberalization and the rush to&#13;
&#13;
 liberalization to say, you know, looking at everything&#13;
&#13;
 that China has done so far versus everything that Russia&#13;
&#13;
 has done so far, the clear implication for poverty.            I&#13;
&#13;
 have the highest amount of respect for some of the work&#13;
&#13;
 that China has done and I think over the last two years in&#13;
&#13;
 particular.   Their economic performance has been -- I&#13;
&#13;
 don't want to say stellar -- but certainly it has been&#13;
&#13;
 constructive.&#13;
&#13;
           But, at the same time, you don't hold up to&#13;
&#13;
 other countries to be the exact Russian model or the exact&#13;
&#13;
 Chinese model.   You talk about the principles on which&#13;
&#13;
 they are proceeding.&#13;
&#13;
           And when we had our Asian miracle paper and then&#13;
&#13;
 the next year Asia disintegrated -- I am not saying&#13;
&#13;
 anything bad about China -- I am just saying before we get&#13;
&#13;
 on the bandwagon of saying China has done a wonderful job&#13;
&#13;
 about all of this, we have to recognize that China itself&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 is facing some important economic and structural problems&#13;
&#13;
 that they are having difficulty getting through.&#13;
&#13;
           You might look at the question of Korea, and&#13;
&#13;
 this comes back to the point on sequencing, how fast do we&#13;
&#13;
 move forward.    In some of my previous jobs, we had to&#13;
&#13;
 negotiate with Korea on how quickly they would open the&#13;
&#13;
 market, and Korea would often say, well, we are sequencing&#13;
&#13;
 that, we will get to that later.        And while we were&#13;
&#13;
 negotiating them honestly and in rather parochial&#13;
&#13;
 interests about opening their markets to some of our&#13;
&#13;
 financial services, providers or goods, I would think in&#13;
&#13;
 retrospect if Korea had moved faster than they did in&#13;
&#13;
 certain areas, they may have had a different experience.&#13;
&#13;
           You might say if they had moved faster, they&#13;
&#13;
 would have had a worst experience.         You are nodding your&#13;
&#13;
 head and I don't agree with that.        And so when you say&#13;
&#13;
 other things like about the capital account, looking at&#13;
&#13;
 Asia, the capital account, liberalization, negative&#13;
&#13;
 implication for poverty, I think you ought to be careful&#13;
&#13;
 of that, honestly.    I mean, there is a lot that the report&#13;
&#13;
 can do without getting into the subjects of a number of&#13;
&#13;
 other reports.   Just leave it like that.&#13;

           I agree environment could probably figure in a&#13;
&#13;
 little bit greater, again without trying to hijack the&#13;
&#13;
 agenda.&#13;
&#13;
           And I suppose I would just conclude by saying&#13;
&#13;
 that I very much appreciated your remarks and, whenever&#13;
&#13;
 you give an intervention, it reminds when I was graduate&#13;
&#13;
 student and I did not have an opportunity to prepare my&#13;
&#13;
 homework, because you start throwing out the names of all&#13;
&#13;
 the famous authors who have said this all before.         I am&#13;
&#13;
 rapidly writing them down.&#13;
&#13;
           I never read most of the studies that you&#13;
&#13;
 referred to, but they sounded like they were right on&#13;
&#13;
 target.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STIGLITZ:    Thank you.      I will come back to&#13;
&#13;
 some of those issues.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Davidse.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. DAVIDSE:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           We also view this outline very favorably and we&#13;
&#13;
 are very impressed also with the process.          I was also&#13;
&#13;
 there yesterday at the workshop and realized you have to&#13;
&#13;
 be there because if you are not, you have to read all the&#13;
&#13;
 documents.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             But it was a very interesting discussion and I&#13;
&#13;
 am very glad with the points you summarized this morning,&#13;
&#13;
 which were the very relevant ones.         I think we know a lot&#13;
&#13;
 more.   The institutional issue is much more in focus.         I&#13;
&#13;
 think also the connection of levels is a very important&#13;
&#13;
 lesson from micro to macro and back basically, which is&#13;
&#13;
 something which is implicitly and explicitly in the text.&#13;
&#13;
             We welcome very much the empowerment and&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity focus.    It fits well with the pro-poor growth&#13;
&#13;
 approach we and others have advocated.          And we agree&#13;
&#13;
 completely with those who say that complexity, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 should not prevent action.      And in that sense, we are very&#13;
&#13;
 glad that we are making policy while the WDR process is&#13;
&#13;
 underway.&#13;
&#13;
             I would say to those who are worried about the&#13;
&#13;
 impact of the report, not only the realizations are, of&#13;
&#13;
 course, new, but it has been an evolution which is not&#13;
&#13;
 that hard to explain to the outside world, I would say.&#13;
&#13;
             So we have to continue to act now with the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction strategy papers we discussed last week,&#13;
&#13;
 and we have to take the internal and external measures to&#13;
&#13;
 make it work, which would mean that by the time the WDR&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 comes out, we will actually have some results hopefully to&#13;
&#13;
 show for the work we are doing.&#13;
&#13;
           Of that lessons you suggest on page 24, we would&#13;
&#13;
 emphasize the third one, economic expansion in which the&#13;
&#13;
 poor participate fully.    This, in our view, is the core of&#13;
&#13;
 the report, and it points to all the points people have&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned -- the need to operationalize this, the need for&#13;
&#13;
 ownership, the need for poverty relevance.&#13;
&#13;
           I was once told glossy documents do not really&#13;
&#13;
 matter.   Look for the shabby ones; those are the ones&#13;
&#13;
 which are really relevant.     And I think this glossy one&#13;
&#13;
 will and should matter.&#13;
&#13;
           Some specific points.      We welcome very much the&#13;
&#13;
 attention paid to gender and ethnicity, but I would agree&#13;
&#13;
 with Germany that the gender focus should be stronger.        It&#13;
&#13;
 is morally sound and it is economically sensible.      A lot&#13;
&#13;
 of work has been done, and I would point to the report in&#13;
&#13;
 the Africa Region of Mark Blackton and Titra Banu&#13;
&#13;
 [phonetic], and I think the gender focus could be beefed&#13;
&#13;
 up a little.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, we welcome very much the attention, of&#13;
&#13;
 course, paid to poverty in transition countries.      It is&#13;
&#13;
 very timely.   I would refer to the statement of Mr.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 Stiglitz of this summer, but also to the UNDP report,&#13;
&#13;
 Poverty in Transition, which point to the fact that we&#13;
&#13;
 need to reflect on this growing problem in transition&#13;
&#13;
 countries.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STIGLITZ:      Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Binkert.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. BINKERT:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           I also like very much the new approach that is&#13;
&#13;
 being explained here with the trilogy of empowerment,&#13;
&#13;
 security, opportunity.      I also like very much, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 the methodological innovation of consulting with the poor&#13;
&#13;
 and, of course, I hope this will be Joe Stiglitz'&#13;
&#13;
 responsibility; it is not going to take another nine-and-&#13;
&#13;
 a-half years before the poor are consulted again for the&#13;
&#13;
 next WDR of 2010.&#13;
&#13;
           It reminds me a little bit of a story that my&#13;
&#13;
 former professor at Stanford, Penutopolis [phonetic] told&#13;
&#13;
 me when he went on a mission to Pakistan for the World&#13;
&#13;
 Bank, and he claims -- that was in the 1980s -- that he&#13;
&#13;
 was the first World Bank consultant to physically visit a&#13;
&#13;
 slum.   And Pakistan, of course, received I don't know how&#13;
&#13;
 missions every single month for decades, and he claims&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 even if he was not the first, there were very, very few&#13;
&#13;
 who physically visited the slum.       So, I guess this is&#13;
&#13;
 really important to talk and find the methodology to have&#13;
&#13;
 this feedback mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I would like to congratulate the team for&#13;
&#13;
 having made this innovation, and I hope in DEC they will&#13;
&#13;
 continue even after the WDR is published.&#13;
&#13;
           But I just would like to make two comments&#13;
&#13;
 basically.   One is the WDR 1999, the Labor-Intensive&#13;
&#13;
 Growth and Provision of Social Services, even though we&#13;
&#13;
 have now more micro data, we have a different way of&#13;
&#13;
 looking at it, I still think those are very valid things.&#13;
&#13;
 And I would be very interested to see somewhere, either in&#13;
&#13;
 the trend chapter, you know what has happened in the&#13;
&#13;
 1990s, or somewhere what happened to labor-intensive&#13;
&#13;
 growth.   How did we perform also region by region?&#13;
&#13;
           And I can say in the transition economies, some&#13;
&#13;
 of which we represent here, we have done very poorly.        In&#13;
&#13;
 Africa we have done very poorly.       Asia I don't quite know,&#13;
&#13;
 but what were the trends in the labor markets and so on?&#13;
&#13;
 It would be very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
           And similarly, what were the trends in both&#13;
&#13;
 access and provision of social services, sort of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 fiscal things, how much went to the social sectors, but&#13;
&#13;
 also the whole debate on cost recovery?            What has cost&#13;
&#13;
 recovery done?   Now that we tell everybody to do it, has&#13;
&#13;
 it truly increased access because of better maintenance,&#13;
&#13;
 better financial viability of those providers, or has it&#13;
&#13;
 reduced it?   Where do we stand empirically?&#13;
&#13;
           Since you still have almost a year to go, maybe&#13;
&#13;
 you can give it a first crack.      I know it is tricky.&#13;
&#13;
           Or the other issue, why particularly Africa, why&#13;
&#13;
 pretty much everybody has become informal, everything is&#13;
&#13;
 an informal market?   Why is that the case and what is the&#13;
&#13;
 implication of it?    And that also leads, of course, very&#13;
&#13;
 much to your issue of security.&#13;
&#13;
           And even if in the informal sector on average&#13;
&#13;
 you may earn the same income, it is different from having&#13;
&#13;
 the same average income through a drop.            The implication&#13;
&#13;
 on security is a very different.&#13;
&#13;
           And I guess with the informal sector -- and that&#13;
&#13;
 would then go towards your Chapter 8 when you look at&#13;
&#13;
 policies of the World Bank -- the whole fiscal debate, I&#13;
&#13;
 think there is a big issue on the fiscal debate.           You&#13;
&#13;
 know, we have moved very, very fast and very, very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 aggressively on reducing trade distortions, I mean tariff&#13;
&#13;
 reductions.&#13;
&#13;
           It is basically two things, tariff reduction and&#13;
&#13;
 introducing value-added tax.       Those are sort of the&#13;
&#13;
 standard package of the IMF.       There was very little work&#13;
&#13;
 on income taxes.   Labor is still being taxed very highly&#13;
&#13;
 in many countries, and we don't care; it is not good, but&#13;
&#13;
 we do not care, whereas we care very deeply how big the&#13;
&#13;
 top tariff is or average tariff is.         We are not as&#13;
&#13;
 aggressive on the other things.&#13;
&#13;
           Urban land taxation, what is the impact of that?&#13;
&#13;
 Maybe that is a less distorting.        It was always value-&#13;
&#13;
 added tax and tariff reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           So, could more light be shed if the fiscal&#13;
&#13;
 system (a) has an impact that it is very expensive to be&#13;
&#13;
 in the formal sector, which then has a big impact on&#13;
&#13;
 security and all these other issues that you discuss?          And&#13;
&#13;
 does it also have an impact on labor-intensive growth?          Is&#13;
&#13;
 the fiscal system one of the reasons maybe why there is&#13;
&#13;
 not as much labor-intensive growth as there could be&#13;
&#13;
 otherwise?&#13;
&#13;
           And my second, maybe small or large part -- I&#13;
&#13;
 don't know -- would be for Chapter 5 when you also talk&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 about security.    What about the whole debate of the last&#13;
&#13;
 20, 30 years on food security?       There have been great&#13;
&#13;
 insights on how to do this, and I think that would be also&#13;
&#13;
 a key dimension.   I didn't see it explicitly, but maybe&#13;
&#13;
 you will deal with it anyway.       I think there is a lot from&#13;
&#13;
 that debate we could also incorporate.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;

           MR. STIGLITZ:     Thank you very much.&#13;

           MS. KILLEN:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Well, not only do we have an excellent outline,&#13;
&#13;
 but we have also had a very good debate this morning. So,&#13;
&#13;
 there is not very much that I can add at this stage.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to associate myself with Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Sinclair's comments, Ms. Brandt's comments, very&#13;
&#13;
 thoughtful intervention by Mr. Pesme, Mr. Davidse and Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Kaplan.   I will just make a few comments which are a bit&#13;
&#13;
 more detailed and which draw on some of the analysis that&#13;
&#13;
 the DFID has been supporting for this report.&#13;
&#13;
           Like others, we welcome the freshness and the&#13;
&#13;
 new thinking in the report, and think that the optic of&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, security and opportunity is useful.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           I welcome the exercise to consult the poor and&#13;
&#13;
 to incorporate their perspectives into the report, and I&#13;
&#13;
 look forward to seeing more of this when the synthesis&#13;
&#13;
 report is ready.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it is very important that we incorporate&#13;
&#13;
 the international development targets, for example, in&#13;
&#13;
 Chapter 2, and the DFID has provided some research on the&#13;
&#13;
 implications for achieving these.&#13;
&#13;
           Like Mr. Sinclair, I think that the two-year&#13;
&#13;
 preparation period should become the norm for future WDRs.&#13;
&#13;
 The broad consultation process, especially in developing&#13;
&#13;
 countries, should enable this WDR to draw on a much richer&#13;
&#13;
 range of thoughts than its predecessors.&#13;
&#13;
           Like my German colleague, I hope that the WDR&#13;
&#13;
 text itself will be less focused on developed country&#13;
&#13;
 academic debate, as in Section 2.3, and more on the policy&#13;
&#13;
 implications of the analysis based on evidence and, as Ms.&#13;
&#13;
 Zou has pointed out, I recognize that this will, of&#13;
&#13;
 course, be different for different contexts.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it will be essential to have a longer&#13;
&#13;
 and more thorough process than usual to feedback and&#13;
&#13;
 debate this report, including to the poor, and in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 language that they will be able to understand.       So, I&#13;
&#13;
 would like to hear your plans for that.&#13;
&#13;
           Turning to the three issues focused in the&#13;
&#13;
 outline, on empowerment, I think why pro-poor policies are&#13;
&#13;
 adopted is a key issue.    Again, DFID has been able to feed&#13;
&#13;
 in a research project on the responsiveness of political&#13;
&#13;
 systems to poverty reduction with practical policy&#13;
&#13;
 suggestions.   And like Ms. Brandt, I look forward to your&#13;
&#13;
 reactions on this.&#13;
&#13;
           We would like to see further developments of the&#13;
&#13;
 analysis on the deep structural inequalities which&#13;
&#13;
 reinforce and perpetuate poverty and how these are often&#13;
&#13;
 translated into policies in favor of the more powerful and&#13;
&#13;
 the better off.&#13;
&#13;
           I would have also liked to see more on&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment with respect to the day-to-day interactions of&#13;
&#13;
 poor people, especially in the marketplace.        The quotes on&#13;
&#13;
 page 12 for Malawi illustrate the problems that poor&#13;
&#13;
 people face, and we need to know how to address these.&#13;
&#13;
           On security, we support the view of the World&#13;
&#13;
 Faith's development dialogue and their comments on the WDR&#13;
&#13;
 approach, that the poor possess certain types of wealth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 that should not be depleted by the development process,&#13;
&#13;
 including their dignity.&#13;
&#13;
           I would also query the lack of reference to the&#13;
&#13;
 human rights' framework for tackling inequalities and the&#13;
&#13;
 need to consider issues of violence and personal&#13;
&#13;
 insecurity.&#13;
&#13;
           On opportunity, I agree that the poor must&#13;
&#13;
 contribute to growth to reach the international&#13;
&#13;
 development targets.    But it would have been interesting&#13;
&#13;
 to see some discussion of tradeoffs here.           For example,&#13;
&#13;
 are the poor better at delivering growth than the non-&#13;
&#13;
 poor?   And where does the dynamism in economies really&#13;
&#13;
 come from?    The DFID Commission research on achieving the&#13;
&#13;
 IDTs points at the value of tackling inequalities at the&#13;
&#13;
 same time as promoting growth.&#13;
&#13;
           On the international dimensions, we would like&#13;
&#13;
 to see a special focus on health technology in the&#13;
&#13;
 technological change issues.       The work on the IDTs has&#13;
&#13;
 highlighted the importance of achieving step changes in&#13;
&#13;
 health by using new technology.&#13;
&#13;
           Also, the linkages between technology and human&#13;
&#13;
 capital, we would like to see how this might affect&#13;
&#13;
 education strategies and what are the complementary&#13;
&#13;

             And finally, we welcome the emphasis on local&#13;

&#13;
             This discussion comes at the end of a long week&#13;
&#13;
 and in the midst of many competing priorities.      The topic&#13;
&#13;
 is extremely important and goes to the heart of the&#13;
&#13;
 development process and the World Bank's role in it.&#13;
&#13;
             I wish the timing could have been better.&#13;
&#13;
 Anyway, I have some very selective general and more&#13;
&#13;
 specific comments.&#13;
&#13;
             Starting with the general points, I think the&#13;
&#13;
 team are off to a very good start along with what seems to&#13;
&#13;
 be the right track, and I have no doubt we will have an&#13;
&#13;
 excellent final product.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           I have a couple of comments about possible risks&#13;
&#13;
 of the team, perhaps biting off more than they can chew,&#13;
&#13;
 or at least realistically delivered.        I found the issues&#13;
&#13;
 listed in the box on page 27 very pertinent in this&#13;
&#13;
 regard.   I see that there are signs of distress amongst&#13;
&#13;
 the community of economists that the report may be moving&#13;
&#13;
 from what they no doubt see as the safe and familiar&#13;
&#13;
 ground of discipline and into uncharted waters of broader&#13;
&#13;
 social science perspective, including political economy or&#13;
&#13;
 even political science aspects.&#13;
&#13;
           There is also the problem if the approach of&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, security and opportunity is followed, there&#13;
&#13;
 will be less opportunity to be sector specific.       This also&#13;
&#13;
 follows from the welcome recognition that the key to&#13;
&#13;
 actual results in reducing poverty will be a process of&#13;
&#13;
 local adaptation and ownership and the ability to learn&#13;
&#13;
 from a range of experiences.&#13;
&#13;
           My initial reaction to this is that it will&#13;
&#13;
 indeed be necessary to move beyond a traditional economic&#13;
&#13;
 approach, especially given the intended focus on&#13;
&#13;
 institutional aspects.    However, the staff should stay&#13;
&#13;
 clearly within the Bank's own non-political mandate if&#13;
&#13;
 reputational risk is to be avoided.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           The focus on local adaptation may lead to a lack&#13;
&#13;
 of specificity.   This can perhaps be remedied by including&#13;
&#13;
 a number of specific boxes in the text, which add some&#13;
&#13;
 detail, as I am sure the team has in mind.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, on the general points, I would share&#13;
&#13;
 the team's view that the basic conclusion regarding&#13;
&#13;
 poverty trends will be one of strong concern on the global&#13;
&#13;
 aggregate.&#13;
&#13;
           Some specific points.        On page 18 and again on&#13;
&#13;
 page 20, there are announced intentions to, and I quote,&#13;
&#13;
 "explain the collapse of societies into civil war and&#13;
&#13;
 review the causes and consequences of civil war".        In my&#13;
&#13;
 view, it will be impossible to do such an analysis without&#13;
&#13;
 going beyond the Bank's non-political mandate, as such&#13;
&#13;
 occurrences are almost by definition of political origin.&#13;
&#13;
 I guess caution is advised here.&#13;
&#13;
           On page 14, there is a discussion headed&#13;
&#13;
 "Eschewing False Dichotomies", something of a mouthful to&#13;
&#13;
 pronounce itself.    Without getting into the details, I&#13;
&#13;
 think the team is to some extent setting up a storm in&#13;
&#13;
 here, as if you were approaching these questions in a&#13;
&#13;
 black or white manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           On page 12, I noted the statement "the&#13;
&#13;
 institutions of the state appear to be failing the poor".&#13;
&#13;
 The obvious rejoinder is they might be failing the poor&#13;
&#13;
 but effectively serving the rich.       However, here again&#13;
&#13;
 this is an issue which would need a full political&#13;
&#13;
 discussion beyond the Bank's mandate to address.&#13;
&#13;
           I think I will stop here, Mr. Chairman, with a&#13;
&#13;
 final suggestion that the team too bear in mind the risk&#13;
&#13;
 that the statement of the poor person in Bulgaria, quoted&#13;
&#13;
 at the bottom of page 11, which I quote, "we know who is&#13;
&#13;
 writing the book", could indeed be the standard by which&#13;
&#13;
 they themselves may be judged.      I nonetheless wish them&#13;
&#13;
 well in a difficult task.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STIGLITZ:    Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
           MR. LYNCH:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Like a lot of my colleagues, I am supportive of&#13;
&#13;
 this paper and I think it is a very good paper.      Like some&#13;
&#13;
 of my colleagues today who seem to talk a lot about&#13;
&#13;
 economists at the university and things, I am a bit&#13;
&#13;
 nervous about talking about economics in the company I am&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 in.   But I guess I wanted to pick up on the British&#13;
&#13;
 comment about tradeoffs.&#13;
&#13;
            I guess that one thing that economics taught me,&#13;
&#13;
 Economics 101, was that economics is about the allocation&#13;
&#13;
 of scarce resources and comparative advantage and the need&#13;
&#13;
 to make tradeoffs.   And I would just like to reinforce&#13;
&#13;
 that point that in this paper it is quite clear poverty is&#13;
&#13;
 still out there; there is a lot to be done, it is a&#13;
&#13;
 complex issue but we cannot do everything.         And as my&#13;
&#13;
 Chinese colleague pointed out when she was talking about&#13;
&#13;
 the rate of return to labor and how labor-intensive growth&#13;
&#13;
 might be good but rate of return may not be as high as&#13;
&#13;
 other investments.   So the question becomes:       How do you&#13;
&#13;
 make those tradeoffs?    And maybe this has something to do&#13;
&#13;
 with the discount rates, poor people must have a very high&#13;
&#13;
 discount rate, because they are concerned very much about&#13;
&#13;
 today.   Yet from a country point of view, are you better&#13;
&#13;
 off doing something to give immediate relief or a longer-&#13;
&#13;
 term investment that might produce more growth?&#13;
&#13;
            It is easy to talk about growth of equity.          Of&#13;
&#13;
 course, we should tackle them, but how do we make those&#13;
&#13;
 difficult tradeoffs when there is a cost to the reaction&#13;
&#13;
 we take?   Because as the U.S. pointed out, we talked about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 selectivity.    I am not sure what selectivity is.      In&#13;
&#13;
 economics we talk about comparative advantage.        And so&#13;
&#13;
 when we start thinking about what this means to the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
 where is our comparative advantage?         Where should we be&#13;
&#13;
 putting our resources?&#13;
&#13;
             And I guess when we come to the section on what&#13;
&#13;
 should the Bank do, because the Board has spent a lot of&#13;
&#13;
 time this year talking about the capital increase and its&#13;
&#13;
 mandate and what resources it needs to carry out that&#13;
&#13;
 mandate, it is going to come down to these sort of&#13;
&#13;
 questions.    And I would be looking at this document not to&#13;
&#13;
 provide the answers but to provide some guidance on those&#13;
&#13;
 things.&#13;
&#13;
             But otherwise, thank you very much for the&#13;
&#13;
 excellent document.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. STIGLITZ:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             Ms. Matesova.&#13;
&#13;
             MS. MATESOVA:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             Really, at this stage of the discussion, there&#13;
&#13;
 is not so much to add.      We also very much appreciate the&#13;
&#13;
 document.    We very much support the broader approach to&#13;
&#13;
 the understanding of poverty, although obviously we will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 get to the difficulty that the income poverty is much&#13;
&#13;
 easier to measure than anything else.&#13;
&#13;
           We were also impressed by the process of&#13;
&#13;
 consultation.   We sort of took for granted that if leaders&#13;
&#13;
 of the team are Mr. Stiglitz and Mr. Kanbur, there is no&#13;
&#13;
 doubt that the risks of having a central bias and these&#13;
&#13;
 kinds of failures are taken care of.&#13;
&#13;
           As far as the content, we also very much&#13;
&#13;
 appreciate the approach to the reflection of the events of&#13;
&#13;
 the past decade and to the change and I would say relative&#13;
&#13;
 weight of ideas and the world of ideas and perhaps to some&#13;
&#13;
 of the very new ideas that appeared.&#13;
&#13;
           The Bank is privileged and disadvantaged, in a&#13;
&#13;
 sense, compared to academicians that it has to recommend&#13;
&#13;
 policies, advise on policies at the end and has to have&#13;
&#13;
 national governments to implement the policies.     And from&#13;
&#13;
 that point of view, I think the report simply does not&#13;
&#13;
 have the chance to really state on the safe grounds of&#13;
&#13;
 academia purely.&#13;
&#13;
           It is a Bank document; it is not a strategy, but&#13;
&#13;
 it will be viewed as a document of an institution that has&#13;
&#13;
 to implement later on.     And from that point of view, I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 think it is simply impossible to stay away from the&#13;
&#13;
 political economy.&#13;
&#13;
           By the way, the political economy is about the&#13;
&#13;
 influence of institutions.     This is precisely what you&#13;
&#13;
 want to emphasize in the report.       And I would subscribe to&#13;
&#13;
 everything Jean Pesme said.     I know that you expect the&#13;
&#13;
 Board to probably give you mainly feedback on the content&#13;
&#13;
 and ideas and you are hearing a lot about the&#13;
&#13;
 operationalization and implementation.         But it is&#13;
&#13;
 important, I would fully agree with Jean Pesme, as many&#13;
&#13;
 others did, that we don't think there is much consistency&#13;
&#13;
 in the Bank in this approach.      So this is something which&#13;
&#13;
 has to be taken into consideration at least for the future&#13;
&#13;
 and for your thinking but the thinking of the team how&#13;
&#13;
 this report will be used.&#13;
&#13;
           Also, what is proposed should be doable for the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank, as it certainly should.      And I think the question&#13;
&#13;
 who is in charge for the big interest is a good question.&#13;
&#13;
 It is a very legitimate question.       Who is in charge for&#13;
&#13;
 the big interest within the Bank but, of course, who is in&#13;
&#13;
 charge for the big interest outside of the Bank?           Who are&#13;
&#13;
 the groups to be targeted?     And I am not speaking about&#13;
&#13;
 the ultimate beneficiary, the poor, but the groups that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 need to be targeted in order to influence, to reduce&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.&#13;
&#13;
            Mr. Singh said that it is the responsibility of&#13;
&#13;
 national governments to implement the poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategies.   I am not so sure it is the full picture and I&#13;
&#13;
 would think that it would be useful in the report to&#13;
&#13;
 identify what parts of the poverty reduction strategies&#13;
&#13;
 are actually global public goods.       I am sure there are&#13;
&#13;
 many of them.&#13;
&#13;
            And, of course, then it has to be someone else&#13;
&#13;
 than just the national government that should take care&#13;
&#13;
 about that.   Part of that is all kinds of regulation.&#13;
&#13;
 Well, we don't see a full document and I am sure many&#13;
&#13;
 parts will be elaborated.     But Ms. Zou referred to the&#13;
&#13;
 point of concentration and changing of market structure in&#13;
&#13;
 the world, and this is certainly again part of the factor&#13;
&#13;
 that will influence the future scope and structure of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty and inequality.&#13;
&#13;
            And the link between institutions and inequality&#13;
&#13;
 and inequality of growth in that part, certainly the&#13;
&#13;
 report will be very useful.     And I would suggest that&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps the thinking could be a little bit broadened, in a&#13;
&#13;
 sense of the link between institutions and inequality,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 also to implement the aspect the implementation of&#13;
&#13;
 institutions.   And it has taken place everywhere, in every&#13;
&#13;
 country all the time, how the transformation of&#13;
&#13;
 institutions affects inequality.&#13;
&#13;
           It certainly does, and there is very little&#13;
&#13;
 research on that aspect.     And we see in transition&#13;
&#13;
 economies some extreme consequences of that.&#13;
&#13;
 Transformation of institutions may cause inequality that&#13;
&#13;
 didn't exist or existed on a very low level initially.&#13;
&#13;
 But this is certainly the case of transformation of&#13;
&#13;
 institutions in well-developed market economies and&#13;
&#13;
 elsewhere as well.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think that is all I wanted to say.               And&#13;
&#13;
 again, we very much appreciate the outline and just can&#13;
&#13;
 subscribe to it.&#13;
&#13;
           Well, perhaps one more thing.             When I was&#13;
&#13;
 referring to Mr. Pesme on the link between the way how the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank does business and this report, I think really it&#13;
&#13;
 would be helpful if indeed the document and as well in the&#13;
&#13;
 thinking of the team, which is not implemented directly in&#13;
&#13;
 the document, to think ahead on the way of marketing the&#13;
&#13;
 document within the Bank and outside.&#13;

           The WDR 1999 just got out.        In my view, it is a&#13;
&#13;
 breakthrough document.    I have no doubt this will be a&#13;
&#13;
 breakthrough document as well.      But the WDR 1999 says two&#13;
&#13;
 major developments in the near future will be&#13;
&#13;
 globalization and localization; both of them affect&#13;
&#13;
 strongly the major clients and members of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
 That means the national governments.&#13;
&#13;
           So this political economy has to be taken into&#13;
&#13;
 account; you want obviously to say it but also we have to&#13;
&#13;
 know how the Bank will deal with it in the future.&#13;

           MR. RUBIANES:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I very much appreciate this opportunity to&#13;
&#13;
 discuss the World Development Report framework.        We attach&#13;
&#13;
 a lot of importance to this report, since it is a source&#13;
&#13;
 of consultation and also the way people take the thinking&#13;
&#13;
 of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           Unfortunately, I think it comes at a very bad&#13;
&#13;
 time, and I share the concern of my colleagues.        So, I&#13;
&#13;
 only will give some general comments and thoughts to this.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Basically, I share, of course, the thematic&#13;
&#13;
 approach, attacking poverty, and the methodology that has&#13;
&#13;
 been used.   This process of consultation I think is very&#13;
&#13;
 interesting, using qualitative methods to know exactly&#13;
&#13;
 what the poor people think about.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't know if you have taken into&#13;
&#13;
 consideration another type of methodology that is exactly&#13;
&#13;
 similar to this, that is the SAPRI [phonetic] exercise,&#13;
&#13;
 the structural adjustment participatory approach in which&#13;
&#13;
 Ecuador is the only Latin American country that&#13;
&#13;
 participates on it.&#13;
&#13;
           I still have some difficulties in the trilogy&#13;
&#13;
 you propose, the empowerment, security and opportunity, as&#13;
&#13;
 the way to attack poverty and give a response to the poor&#13;
&#13;
 voices.   Let me ask you:   Is this the new economic theory&#13;
&#13;
 of the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
           I also have some other general concerns which&#13;
&#13;
 probably could go much beyond this particular World&#13;
&#13;
 Development Report work.    And I want to pose some&#13;
&#13;
 questions, maybe some naive questions.&#13;
&#13;
           One of them is that a lot of studies have been&#13;
&#13;
 done, especially on poverty, but it is not clear to me if&#13;
&#13;
 we are only analyzing what poverty is about, but we still&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 are not clear on how to deal with the poverty issue and&#13;
&#13;
 what is the World Bank's role in going from the diagnosis&#13;
&#13;
 to the action in an effort to reduce poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           Another question that comes to mind is:   Is the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank going to continue mainly on this thinking as a think&#13;
&#13;
 tank or it is going to play still the developmental role&#13;
&#13;
 in financing specific investment projects, in which, as&#13;
&#13;
 you mentioned on page 9, for instance, the participatory&#13;
&#13;
 of beneficiaries, the contribution of NGOs is really very&#13;
&#13;
 important and makes the difference in the micro level.&#13;
&#13;
           Another issue is the participatory approach&#13;
&#13;
 itself.   Since these kind of consultations -- and I could&#13;
&#13;
 refer also to the case of SAPRI as well -- create a sort&#13;
&#13;
 of expectation in the people who are consulted, and if you&#13;
&#13;
 don't give them a sort of solution to the problems, what&#13;
&#13;
 you probably are doing is creating frustration to them.&#13;
&#13;
 Because they believe the Bank is becoming the&#13;
&#13;
 intermediary, in-between the people, the civil society and&#13;
&#13;
 government.   And that I think is a little bit far beyond&#13;
&#13;
 the mandate of the Bank and eventually the comparative&#13;
&#13;
 advantage of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't know if you are going to deal with the&#13;
&#13;
 institutions.   And you mention it in the framework.    But I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 think you have to be very careful on not only creating but&#13;
&#13;
 reinforcing existing institutions, because participation&#13;
&#13;
 and also decentralization should be linked to&#13;
&#13;
 accountability.&#13;
&#13;
             The Bank is undertaking many activities, most of&#13;
&#13;
 them under the poverty reduction objective, as has been&#13;
&#13;
 described in the paper on new international financial&#13;
&#13;
 architecture and in a brief we have on innovation&#13;
&#13;
 marketplace and even in the SAPRI exercise.         So, I share&#13;
&#13;
 very much the concept of selectivity that I think Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Kaplan mentioned, because we have to give priorities.&#13;
&#13;
             There is no doubt that there is a constraint,&#13;
&#13;
 the budget constraint even.      So, I have a final problem,&#13;
&#13;
 which is:    How are you going to institutionalize in the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank, to mainstream, for instance, the CDF?         It is going&#13;
&#13;
 to be an operational way to introduce it?&#13;
&#13;
             I consider it as a pilot project that has been&#13;
&#13;
 used in only a few countries.       So, I don't know how you&#13;
&#13;
 are going to deal with all the developing countries, all&#13;
&#13;
 the borrowing countries in the Bank.         Is the country&#13;
&#13;
 assistance strategy the way you are going to use to give&#13;
&#13;
 the new scheme of the CDF to those countries?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Is this the best way the Bank will serve its&#13;
&#13;
 client needs?   Those are some of my concerns.&#13;
&#13;
           So, it comes to my mind that maybe the World&#13;
&#13;
 Bank should also need a sort of holistic approach with a&#13;
&#13;
 sort of matrix to include all the activities it is dealing&#13;
&#13;
 with to really give priority to the role of the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
 the future.&#13;
&#13;
           And in this way, I recommend something you&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned at the very end, it should be a participatory&#13;
&#13;
 approach, inside the Bank, taking into consideration all&#13;
&#13;
 the members of the Bank, including the Board members,&#13;
&#13;
 management and staff.     And that should be done before&#13;
&#13;
 mainstreaming all these instruments into operations.&#13;

&#13;
           I will be brief.     Hopefully, I can keep my&#13;
&#13;
 promise of doing that.    We have had a very stimulating&#13;
&#13;
 discussion, I think, and I have benefited a lot from it.&#13;
&#13;
           Like others, I like the focus on poverty, the&#13;
&#13;
 role of civil society, the extensive consultation process&#13;
&#13;
 and the issue of people's empowerment, security and so on.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Chairman, when I came here about ten, eleven&#13;
&#13;
 months ago, I was taken aback a little bit by the report&#13;
&#13;
 that the Bank has been in Bolivia for twenty years and a&#13;
&#13;
 lot of good things have happened in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic performance, but poverty has actually&#13;
&#13;
 increased.    And I said, well, this has been the mandate of&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank.    What is the Bank doing?       And I think this is&#13;
&#13;
 the right focus that you have started now and you seem to&#13;
&#13;
 be dealing with it from time to time, because unless we do&#13;
&#13;
 that, I think we will have a very divided world, and our&#13;
&#13;
 idea of all people being equal and having a stake, having&#13;
&#13;
 participation will fail.     So, I want to commend you on&#13;
&#13;
 that and also hope you will continue your emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
 this.&#13;
&#13;
             Having said that, I just want to make one or two&#13;
&#13;
 comments.    The first one is on the role of civil society.&#13;
&#13;
 I think from my experience the role of civil society is&#13;
&#13;
 directly related to the non-committal or non-democratic&#13;
&#13;
 nature of governments.     In other words, the more&#13;
&#13;
 autocratic, the more uncommitted governments are, then the&#13;
&#13;
 more civil society will be needed.         But other than that,&#13;
&#13;
 we ought to be very careful in the sense that civil&#13;
&#13;
 society, like Mr. Singh alluded to, including the Bank or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 even donors, are not driving the development agenda of&#13;
&#13;
 these countries.   If we do that, it is tantamount to the&#13;
&#13;
 country government trying to drive development without the&#13;
&#13;
 people, of their own people.       So that appears to me&#13;
&#13;
 something that we should pay attention to.&#13;
&#13;
            The second one is the issue raised in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 the applicability of orthodox economic theory.             I think&#13;
&#13;
 beyond more economic and beyond guiding principles of&#13;
&#13;
 self-interest, I think there are a lot of variations.                  And&#13;
&#13;
 I would subscribe to your characterization of these&#13;
&#13;
 issues.&#13;
&#13;
            I don't want to pick up a fight; it is too big&#13;
&#13;
 for me.    But I think I would appreciate the way you put it&#13;
&#13;
 between China and the Soviet Union, because that is the&#13;
&#13;
 reality.   I think there is virtue of whether you put the&#13;
&#13;
 cart first or the horse first.       That is the issue.           We&#13;
&#13;
 call it sequencing.&#13;
&#13;
            So, I think when we see failures, we call them&#13;
&#13;
 by its name as a failure.      So, I see that we should not be&#13;
&#13;
 pursuing policies that work in one area and don't work in&#13;
&#13;
 another area.   It just depends on different situations.&#13;
&#13;
            So, the same thing in Zambia.            I think the&#13;
&#13;
 country privatized where there was no capacity to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 privatize and the performance in that country pleases&#13;
&#13;
 anybody who is associated with that country.        So, the&#13;
&#13;
 social context in which the theory, as much as I believe&#13;
&#13;
 in that theory, self-interest approach, but the context&#13;
&#13;
 must be there for us to say whether it is working or not.&#13;
&#13;
           Another area is the concept of democracy versus&#13;
&#13;
 participation.   I read Mr. Stiglitz' article on outreach&#13;
&#13;
 on that one, and I was very pleased.        He was not saying&#13;
&#13;
 you have a two-part system in democracy but participation.&#13;
&#13;
 And those are two different things.        And I don't think we&#13;
&#13;
 should judge from here these countries unless we have two-&#13;
&#13;
 part systems with democracy.      So, I don't think we can be&#13;
&#13;
 very, very strict in our approach and simply say that&#13;
&#13;
 these models could be transferred and applied in these&#13;
&#13;
 countries.   And I would commend to you that you see this&#13;
&#13;
 as an important approach.&#13;
&#13;
           Another issue, for instance, just in the realm&#13;
&#13;
 of ideas, concepts and so on, the concept of free press.&#13;
&#13;
 Now free press I think is very important and very good,&#13;
&#13;
 but where are you using it?     What country?      In what&#13;
&#13;
 cultural context has it been used?&#13;
&#13;
           I was in Uganda about ten months ago, and I just&#13;
&#13;
 happened to pick up the papers and read them.        And Uganda&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 is trying to be a very democratic country.            It is a very&#13;
&#13;
 diverse country in terms of ethnicity, in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 type of government they have and in terms of free press,&#13;
&#13;
 parliament and so on.      But one looks at those headlines&#13;
&#13;
 and it is kind of disturbing because they focus on&#13;
&#13;
 somebody stole this, somebody did this, somebody did that,&#13;
&#13;
 which is not very, very constructive.&#13;
&#13;
           Those individually are in the context of the&#13;
&#13;
 issue but to just label them as such is very destructive.&#13;
&#13;
 What I am trying to say is that this concept is developed&#13;
&#13;
 in a particular history, in a particular context, and we&#13;
&#13;
 should be very careful in not trying to wholesale, take&#13;
&#13;
 them and say this is how it should be.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STIGLITZ:      Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Lvin.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. LVIN:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I will try my best to be brief.            And being if&#13;
&#13;
 not the last speakers but one of the last speakers,&#13;
&#13;
 definitely I think it would be quite fair if I associate&#13;
&#13;
 myself mostly with Mr. Rivera.        I feel great sympathy to&#13;
&#13;
 what he has said.     And it allows me to be brief, by the&#13;
&#13;
 way.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           So since very much was said about the outline,&#13;
&#13;
 and we are discussing not the report itself, which I am&#13;
&#13;
 sure will contain a great deal of detail, empirical data,&#13;
&#13;
 very subtle observations and deductions, I prefer to talk&#13;
&#13;
 about three points made on page 14, which enumerate so-&#13;
&#13;
 called false dichotomies.     And why I decided to&#13;
&#13;
 concentrate on them is precisely because I don't think&#13;
&#13;
 these dichotomies are false.      I think they are very much&#13;
&#13;
 real and they will stay real for a long time to come.&#13;
&#13;
           And some of my other remarks can fit in the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion of these dichotomies.&#13;
&#13;
           First, about state versus market economy, which&#13;
&#13;
 is second in your list.    I think one cannot deny its&#13;
&#13;
 existence.   And it can be compared with the issue of&#13;
&#13;
 voiceless and powerlessness which was strongly mentioned&#13;
&#13;
 in the report.   I think that the idea that we have to&#13;
&#13;
 extensively quote from the poor, which is a starting point&#13;
&#13;
 about discussion about voicelessness, is very interesting,&#13;
&#13;
 this idea of quoting from the poor.&#13;
&#13;
           But I am afraid that it adds not very much to&#13;
&#13;
 the substance of the report but to its, I would say,&#13;
&#13;
 marketability among various NGOs, whose members, by the&#13;
&#13;
 way, tend to be very affluent and not the poor themselves.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           If we look more soberly, seriously at the matter&#13;
&#13;
 of voicelessness, of powerlessness, we will see that we&#13;
&#13;
 are moving toward the very end of the century, and that&#13;
&#13;
 the poor and uneducated, they are not poor because they&#13;
&#13;
 have no access to power.    They have no access to power&#13;
&#13;
 because they are poor.    So, it is practically impossible&#13;
&#13;
 to give them voice, to give them power by some decree.&#13;
&#13;
           We know a huge number of examples when the&#13;
&#13;
 claims that the poor must be given voice and power is the&#13;
&#13;
 shortest way to the rule of demagogues, manipulators,&#13;
&#13;
 dictators and so on.&#13;
&#13;
           On the contrary, there is the market which is&#13;
&#13;
 very much versus the state, it is very much the way the&#13;
&#13;
 institution, the playground, where even the poor have a&#13;
&#13;
 voice, have very strong power, at least due to their&#13;
&#13;
 number, to their combined power, and the fact that so many&#13;
&#13;
 countries, so many corporations, individuals so strongly&#13;
&#13;
 fight for access to the markets of developing countries is&#13;
&#13;
 a test to the fact that these poor have their voice on the&#13;
&#13;
 marketplace, have their power on the marketplace, and, if&#13;
&#13;
 we would like to make them voiceful, powerful, the best&#13;
&#13;
 way, the easiest way is to liquidate the market barriers&#13;
&#13;
 on their access to the market.&#13;

&#13;
           Another point is about the dichotomy between&#13;
&#13;
 growth and distribution.    It is very fashionable to talk&#13;
&#13;
 about combining the two of them, the two of these issues.&#13;
&#13;
 But I am not sure.    Maybe it was the economists who I&#13;
&#13;
 believe are the greatest thing in this century about&#13;
&#13;
 development economics and very rarely mentioned in this&#13;
&#13;
 institution.   I am talking about Peter Bahler [phonetic].&#13;
&#13;
 It was probably he who observed that when we are talking&#13;
&#13;
 about growth, when we care about growth, we are catering&#13;
&#13;
 to the noble feeling of compassion.        And when we are&#13;
&#13;
 talking about distribution and equality, more often than&#13;
&#13;
 not we are catering to the feeling of envy.&#13;
&#13;
           It is obvious that total poverty is absolutely&#13;
&#13;
 equal to total equality.    On the other hand, very rapid&#13;
&#13;
 growth and very rapid liquidation of poverty may lead to&#13;
&#13;
 growing inequality.   So, I would prefer to stick with&#13;
&#13;
 growth and to soften our emphasis on distribution and&#13;
&#13;
 equality, if we are talking about the poor, not about the&#13;
&#13;
 relative place in the ladder of wealth.&#13;
&#13;
           About open versus closed economy, it again&#13;
&#13;
 alludes to the experience of East Asia, and it was several&#13;
&#13;
 times that I spoke about this hear.        I hate to repeat&#13;
&#13;
 myself, but I think that proper analysis of what happened&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 in East Asia does not prove the idea that a closed economy&#13;
&#13;
 would have fared better than an open one.&#13;
&#13;
           For example, there is precisely the East Asian&#13;
&#13;
 Region which has the most open economy in the world.       I am&#13;
&#13;
 talking about Hong Kong, China, and it was not very&#13;
&#13;
 seriously hit by the crisis.&#13;
&#13;
           Precisely, we can make a sort of distinction&#13;
&#13;
 that those who were relatively more closed were probably&#13;
&#13;
 hit more strongly by the crisis within the same region.&#13;
&#13;
 And besides, it is still to be demonstrated the fact of&#13;
&#13;
 openness contributed to the fact of the crisis itself.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, let me make just two short assorted&#13;
&#13;
 remarks, first about China and Russia, which were&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned in the report, in the discussion.        I think that&#13;
&#13;
 comparison of China and Russia is very much important.       It&#13;
&#13;
 is a very rich field of future research, and I was&#13;
&#13;
 somewhat surprised that this important comparison was used&#13;
&#13;
 to make rather trivial observation that expansion and&#13;
&#13;
 growth lead to increased income for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't think it was necessary to invoke this&#13;
&#13;
 comparison to make this statement.&#13;
&#13;
           On the other hand, in a very cursory way I would&#13;
&#13;
 note that this comparison of China and Russia is usually&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 made on a very superficial level by the journalists.         It&#13;
&#13;
 is very popular among the journalists.         And I know&#13;
&#13;
 unfortunately not of much serious research about this.&#13;
&#13;
           I remember that Jeff Saks and some of his guys&#13;
&#13;
 produced a number of articles and even books about this&#13;
&#13;
 and some Russian economists looked into this.         And their&#13;
&#13;
 result is very much against what journalists and the&#13;
&#13;
 general public believe.&#13;
&#13;
           Generally, it means it was China which made very&#13;
&#13;
 serious, very liberal economic reforms which performed&#13;
&#13;
 sort of shock therapy, if you wish, and it was Russia who&#13;
&#13;
 chose a very gradual approach with obvious results we have&#13;
&#13;
 now.   Of course, we are not talking about absolute levels.&#13;
&#13;
 Russia is still more affluent than China.          We are talking&#13;
&#13;
 about pace of development and Chinese reform started in&#13;
&#13;
 the late 1970s, mid-1980s, not five, not seven years ago.&#13;
&#13;
 So, it is a little bit too early to compare these&#13;
&#13;
 countries when we compare some other transition economies.&#13;
&#13;
           A final point, on page 21, when the idea state&#13;
&#13;
 versus market translates that we must argue against&#13;
&#13;
 universal prescriptions.    I understand that very much must&#13;
&#13;
 be decided on a case-by-case basis.        But for economists to&#13;
&#13;
 deny that their knowledge has any universal value is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 tantamount to deny the rationale of their existence at&#13;
&#13;
 all, I believe.   And maybe we are talking about crisis of&#13;
&#13;
 mainstreaming economic theory in the United States and in&#13;
&#13;
 the world at large.    We must talk about the fact that this&#13;
&#13;
 theory failed in many aspects.       But it must not lead us to&#13;
&#13;
 the opinion that we don't need any theory at all.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STIGLITZ:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           It is one o'clock.      So I am going to try to be&#13;
&#13;
 brief in some of my responses and Ravi will also try to be&#13;
&#13;
 brief.&#13;
&#13;
           I think the report has demonstrated one thing,&#13;
&#13;
 that it can stimulate a lot of interesting debate, and I&#13;
&#13;
 think there has been a very good debate and discussion of&#13;
&#13;
 the issues.   They are complex.      Poverty is a complex&#13;
&#13;
 phenomena.    If it were easier, we would have made more&#13;
&#13;
 progress in attacking it.      And it is clear that there are&#13;
&#13;
 some different perspectives on the best way to approach&#13;
&#13;
 it.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me just make a few very brief remarks.         The&#13;
&#13;
 first is I am very supportive of the kind of consultation&#13;
&#13;
 process that has been a part of this.          But I should point&#13;
&#13;
 out that this is expensive.      It isn't free.     And I do want&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 to thank those governments who have helped support this,&#13;
&#13;
 and we have also gotten support from outside foundations,&#13;
&#13;
 but without trying to sound self-serving, I do hope you&#13;
&#13;
 will continue to support the WDR and DEC in their efforts&#13;
&#13;
 in this area, because without that financial support we&#13;
&#13;
 won't be able to continue.&#13;
&#13;
           Secondly, I cannot help but comment a little bit&#13;
&#13;
 on the discussion on the neo-classical paradigm, which has&#13;
&#13;
 bubbled up in a number of different remarks.&#13;
&#13;
           In the way that that term is used, it is based&#13;
&#13;
 on a theory, a model, a set of assumptions of the market&#13;
&#13;
 economy, which by and large are not well accepted today.&#13;
&#13;
 The classical statement is that of Arrow and Debrew&#13;
&#13;
 [phonetic] and those models assume perfect information, a&#13;
&#13;
 complete set of markets, including a complete set of risk&#13;
&#13;
 markets, no technical change, no entrepreneurship; all the&#13;
&#13;
 things that we think of as central in the development&#13;
&#13;
 process are left out of the neo-classical model.&#13;
&#13;
           The implication of the neo-classical model are&#13;
&#13;
 things like institutions do not matter.            It is institution&#13;
&#13;
 free, and it is more than it is institution free, but it&#13;
&#13;
 is the insertion that institutions do not matter.           It also&#13;
&#13;
 argues that wealth distribution does not matter.           It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 doesn't make any difference what the wealth distribution&#13;
&#13;
 is because the economic forces are independent of that.      I&#13;
&#13;
 think that is wrong.    And I think the wealth of evidence&#13;
&#13;
 is that that particular theory is wrong.&#13;
&#13;
             Having said that, let me say that I think one of&#13;
&#13;
 the conclusions of the neo-classical theory is one that I&#13;
&#13;
 agree with, which is the importance of market forces, and&#13;
&#13;
 the importance of looking for what we might call market-&#13;
&#13;
 friendly policies.    Growth, and the central focus of where&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank has been for a long time, is an essential part of&#13;
&#13;
 a mission to reduce poverty.       You don't need a&#13;
&#13;
 sophisticated model.&#13;
&#13;
             But, on the other hand, we also recognize that&#13;
&#13;
 not all growth is pro-poor, that you can have growth&#13;
&#13;
 without bringing people out of poverty, and there are some&#13;
&#13;
 strategies of growth that are more effective in bringing&#13;
&#13;
 people out of poverty.     And one of the kinds of things&#13;
&#13;
 that we are trying to be concerned with is how do we&#13;
&#13;
 design focused directed programs that are pro-poor growth&#13;
&#13;
 policies.&#13;
&#13;
             Some of you may have seen the Op-Ed [phonetic]&#13;
&#13;
 that Jim and I had in the FT yesterday where we tried to&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 articulate that particular view.        And I believe that one&#13;
&#13;
 can have that kind of focused policy.&#13;
&#13;
             The suggestion was made that the United States&#13;
&#13;
 was successful because it pursued the neo-classical&#13;
&#13;
 paradigm.    I would argue that a central question is the&#13;
&#13;
 role of government in achieving a balance, and I would&#13;
&#13;
 argue that the United States was successful because it did&#13;
&#13;
 not pursue the neo-classical paradigm, and that, in fact,&#13;
&#13;
 if you look at the history of the United States, it has&#13;
&#13;
 been much more balanced than the ideologues would have us&#13;
&#13;
 believe.&#13;
&#13;
             Just to give you a couple of examples.     The&#13;
&#13;
 success in technology in the United States was based on&#13;
&#13;
 the U.S. Government having supported the development of&#13;
&#13;
 the telegraph, supported the development of the Internet,&#13;
&#13;
 which is the basis of the modern economy, having supported&#13;
&#13;
 research in agriculture in the 19th century, which was the&#13;
&#13;
 basis of American productivity.        These were all government&#13;
&#13;
 efforts.&#13;
&#13;
             The fact is that beginning in 1863, the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
 Government instituted a system of financial market&#13;
&#13;
 regulation which has worked better at some times and worse&#13;
&#13;
 at other times.    But the worst problem was when the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 ideologues in the 1980s stripped away the regulation and&#13;
&#13;
 we had the S&amp;L crisis.    And we now recognize it was&#13;
&#13;
 excessive deregulation that led to the problems, not&#13;
&#13;
 excessive role of government.&#13;
&#13;
           It is trying to find the right set of&#13;
&#13;
 regulations, and there are areas in which the regulations&#13;
&#13;
 have been stifling.   And I agree with trying to get rid of&#13;
&#13;
 those regulations, but finding the right regulatory&#13;
&#13;
 framework is absolutely essential.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we have recognized in our research in&#13;
&#13;
 the East Asia crisis that it was financial market&#13;
&#13;
 liberalization without putting in place the regulatory&#13;
&#13;
 structure combined with capital market opening,&#13;
&#13;
 particularly at the short-term end, which contributed very&#13;
&#13;
 greatly to that crisis.&#13;
&#13;
           And at some time later, Mr. Kaplan and I should&#13;
&#13;
 have a discussion about whether the issue facing Korea was&#13;
&#13;
 whether it was too fast or too slow, but I think you all&#13;
&#13;
 know my views on that.&#13;
&#13;
           It is also the case that an important part I&#13;
&#13;
 think of the success in the United States was the&#13;
&#13;
 development of safety nets that are important not only in&#13;
&#13;
 the United States but everywhere in maintaining social&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 stability that is important for social and economic,&#13;
&#13;
 political stability, for investors to have confidence in&#13;
&#13;
 putting their money into a country.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we have to look in a very pragmatic&#13;
&#13;
 empirical way where there has been success and where there&#13;
&#13;
 has been failure.    There have been countries that have had&#13;
&#13;
 pro-poor growth.    We have to say that if you look at the&#13;
&#13;
 experience of China, it has had perhaps the largest&#13;
&#13;
 reduction in poverty over the last twenty years and the&#13;
&#13;
 fastest rate of economic growth of any major area of the&#13;
&#13;
 world, perhaps ever.     And we have to recognize that&#13;
&#13;
 success and we have to recognize, well, yes, it was open&#13;
&#13;
 in trade, it did not have openness in capital accounts and&#13;
&#13;
 did not follow many of the dictates of the neo-classical&#13;
&#13;
 model.   I think they took a very pragmatic way.&#13;
&#13;
           There are concerns that people raise, and I&#13;
&#13;
 think we all know about some of those concerns.             But the&#13;
&#13;
 fact is we have to look at the success.              We have to worry&#13;
&#13;
 about whether it will continue, but we have to look at&#13;
&#13;
 what is happening there.&#13;
&#13;
           We also have to recognize that there are other&#13;
&#13;
 regions in the world where poverty has soared in the last&#13;
&#13;
 ten years, and we have to address those concerns.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Not only can we have growth that is not pro-&#13;
&#13;
 poor, but we have decline that increases poverty, not&#13;
&#13;
 surprisingly.   So, these are issues that we really do have&#13;
&#13;
 to address.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me just turn to two other issues.          First of&#13;
&#13;
 all, the reach of the WDR, by talking about a number of&#13;
&#13;
 these issues, will go beyond the mandate of the Bank.          Let&#13;
&#13;
 me say that I view the mandate of the Bank is essentially&#13;
&#13;
 an economics mandate, a poverty alleviation mandate, but I&#13;
&#13;
 think there is an increasing recognition that addressing&#13;
&#13;
 those issues takes us into areas that are beyond you might&#13;
&#13;
 call standard views of narrow economics.           And I think we&#13;
&#13;
 have gotten used to that.&#13;
&#13;
           For instance, in the debate over corruption,&#13;
&#13;
 that corruption has adverse effects on economic growth&#13;
&#13;
 and, therefore, it is part of the Bank's mandate to deal&#13;
&#13;
 with the issue of corruption.      I think we have to deal&#13;
&#13;
 with these things with a great deal of care, that they do&#13;
&#13;
 not become political in their own right, and that they&#13;
&#13;
 keep a focus on our mandate which is poverty, but I think&#13;
&#13;
 we have to explore whatever causes poverty to see where it&#13;
&#13;
 will lead.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             Secondly, I think there were a number of very&#13;
&#13;
 important suggestions of putting more emphasis on areas&#13;
&#13;
 that are related to poverty, for instance, gender and&#13;
&#13;
 environment, and I also want to particularly support the&#13;
&#13;
 view of the importance of children in poverty, because we&#13;
&#13;
 know that the incidence of poverty among children is&#13;
&#13;
 higher than the population as a whole, and the&#13;
&#13;
 consequences for the future growth of the economy are&#13;
&#13;
 potentially more severe.&#13;
&#13;
             And this relates to the third topic, which is&#13;
&#13;
 implementation; trying to figure out how we can target&#13;
&#13;
 poverty among children seems to me an important&#13;
&#13;
 implementation issue that we want to deal with in the&#13;
&#13;
 future.&#13;
&#13;
             The final reach question of the WDR is the&#13;
&#13;
 question of implementation.      The WDR typically should be&#13;
&#13;
 setting out the intellectual framework, the framework for&#13;
&#13;
 discussion.    It in my mind should provide a basis for&#13;
&#13;
 discussion within the Bank on implementation on issues of&#13;
&#13;
 how we attack it, but it is not an implementation&#13;
&#13;
 document.    It is providing the intellectual background for&#13;
&#13;
 that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            But, on the other hand, I think it is very&#13;
&#13;
 important for the WDR to have firmly in mind the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation issues as it goes forward, that it is a&#13;
&#13;
 document that is designed to orient our thinking about&#13;
&#13;
 what the development community more broadly and what the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank can do to alleviate poverty.       I think some of the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion has highlighted some of the directions in which&#13;
&#13;
 that thinking may be effective.&#13;
&#13;
            For instance, we know that economic volatility&#13;
&#13;
 can give be a very important source of poverty.       When the&#13;
&#13;
 economies go into a recession, poverty increases, as we&#13;
&#13;
 have seen in the East Asia crisis.        Some of the policies&#13;
&#13;
 that we have advocated for promotion of growth also have&#13;
&#13;
 the consequence that they also increase volatility.       We&#13;
&#13;
 have not talked about that volatility aspect in our mind&#13;
&#13;
 set.&#13;
&#13;
            We now have to begin, as we think about poverty,&#13;
&#13;
 to start looking more carefully about how policies affect&#13;
&#13;
 not only growth but also volatility and through volatility&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.   So that is one example.&#13;
&#13;
            Another example that was raised is, for&#13;
&#13;
 instance, on tax policy, where we focused in the past&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps on issues of efficiency, dead-weight loss,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Harbiger [phonetic] triangles, all the narrow technical&#13;
&#13;
 issues of what you might call neo-classical economics.&#13;
&#13;
             We have ignored perhaps more than we should&#13;
&#13;
 issues of distribution consequences.         Value-added taxes&#13;
&#13;
 are proportional taxes and, as a result, are not as&#13;
&#13;
 progressive, do not have the distributional consequences&#13;
&#13;
 of other kinds of taxes, for instance, tariffs that are&#13;
&#13;
 luxuries.&#13;
&#13;
             We also have ignored the fact that some tax&#13;
&#13;
 structures are more immune to corruption than others, and&#13;
&#13;
 corruption is a problem in many parts of the world, and we&#13;
&#13;
 have to be sensitive to how the tax structure interacts&#13;
&#13;
 with corruption.&#13;
&#13;
             And thirdly, we have to recognize that the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation of taxes is very different in developed and&#13;
&#13;
 less-developed countries.      The point that was made I think&#13;
&#13;
 quite forcefully that tax structures can push the economy&#13;
&#13;
 into informality and that, in turn, has impacts on poverty&#13;
&#13;
 is something that has not been really taken into account&#13;
&#13;
 enough I think in the discussions, in the designs of tax&#13;
&#13;
 structure.&#13;
&#13;
             So, I think there really is a rich set of&#13;
&#13;
 implications of where this WDR can go for implementation.&#13;

 I assume that you will encourage the team to keep their&#13;
&#13;
 focus on that topic as they go forward.&#13;
&#13;
           Ravi.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. KANBUR:    Well, thank you very much indeed.&#13;
&#13;
 And thank you for all of those comments and observations.&#13;
&#13;
 We have been writing them down furiously.           Obviously, I&#13;
&#13;
 won't be able to respond to them in detail.&#13;
&#13;
           In fact, we will come back to you and discuss&#13;
&#13;
 those specific points in the weeks to come.&#13;
&#13;
           There seemed to me to be a tension between two&#13;
&#13;
 types of comments.    One is it is all known.        We have been&#13;
&#13;
 talking about this for a long time, and be careful how you&#13;
&#13;
 actually say these things in the report, how you&#13;
&#13;
 encapsulate what is being said, because this is a&#13;
&#13;
 particular document, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
           On the one hand, it is all known.          On the other&#13;
&#13;
 hand, we knew all of this but be careful what you say in&#13;
&#13;
 this document.    There seems to be a little bit of a&#13;
&#13;
 tension there which we should be aware of.&#13;
&#13;
           We take very much the point in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 operationalization and implementation, in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 empirical support and so on.       I mean, that is, of course,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the work that we are now going into in that case.    So, I&#13;
&#13;
 think that is very much clear for us.&#13;
&#13;
            And also the methodological issues that the&#13;
&#13;
 participative techniques, the voices of the poor type&#13;
&#13;
 techniques have to go hand-in-hand with the more standard&#13;
&#13;
 household survey analysis and statistical analysis and so&#13;
&#13;
 on, which, of course, many of us have indeed worked on and&#13;
&#13;
 continue to work on.     So, I think that point is also very&#13;
&#13;
 well taken, that it has to be a balanced approach in this&#13;
&#13;
 context.&#13;
&#13;
            In fact, I would say the approach paper looks&#13;
&#13;
 balanced to me, but maybe it look unbalanced because we&#13;
&#13;
 haven't had those sorts of quotes in these sorts of&#13;
&#13;
 documents before.&#13;
&#13;
            The issue of overlapping discourses, overlapping&#13;
&#13;
 methodologies, balanced approach, I think those points are&#13;
&#13;
 very well taken indeed.&#13;
&#13;
            And I think as we go forward, given the views&#13;
&#13;
 that you have expressed and given this notion of we knew&#13;
&#13;
 all of this but we have got to be careful how to&#13;
&#13;
 encapsulate this thing, I think we clearly have to go&#13;
&#13;
 forward, keeping very close consultation with you, and&#13;

                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 also this goes back to the question about what process we&#13;
&#13;
 are going to follow from now onwards.&#13;
&#13;
            Our idea is that instead of now coming back to&#13;
&#13;
 you in June, sort of saying thank you very much, we will&#13;
&#13;
 come back to you in June with a report, what we would like&#13;
&#13;
 to do, in fact, is to come back to you around about&#13;
&#13;
 December/January with actually a very rough first draft of&#13;
&#13;
 this thing, and have an informal technical level seminar&#13;
&#13;
 to get inputs from you on that, so that at a very early&#13;
&#13;
 stage we get a feedback from you.&#13;
&#13;
            And indeed, following up on the comments of how&#13;
&#13;
 is this consultation that we have launched on the outline&#13;
&#13;
 going to be continued, our idea is also to actually take&#13;
&#13;
 rough drafts of this report for outside discussion and for&#13;
&#13;
 broad consultation, so that indeed we get feedback in this&#13;
&#13;
 area.&#13;
&#13;
            You are right, it is uncharted waters, although&#13;
&#13;
 we seem to have known it, but it is uncharted waters&#13;
&#13;
 nevertheless, perhaps for the Bank, and we need to do&#13;
&#13;
 that.&#13;
&#13;
            So, that is our intention with how we move&#13;
&#13;
 forward.   I said I was going to mention something about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 our consultations with civil society, et cetera.           Two very&#13;
&#13;
 important points I wanted to make.&#13;
&#13;
           One thing came out very strongly, and this goes&#13;
&#13;
 back to Mr. Rivera's point on agricultural protection and&#13;
&#13;
 developed country protection and so on.            A very strong&#13;
&#13;
 point that came up to us from these consultations is where&#13;
&#13;
 is the Bank's voice as a champion of the poor, of poor&#13;
&#13;
 countries in global councils?      So, you are talking about&#13;
&#13;
 the voice of the poor, and the Bank comes to us to say&#13;
&#13;
 liberalize, do this, that and the other, and yet we don't&#13;
&#13;
 see the Bank's position coming out strongly in areas of&#13;
&#13;
 agricultural protection and so on, developed country&#13;
&#13;
 protection in general.&#13;
&#13;
           And this links back to global public goods, et&#13;
&#13;
 cetera.   So, I think that point came through very strongly&#13;
&#13;
 in the consultations for us, and I made this point to Joe&#13;
&#13;
 that he should now start talking more about these sorts of&#13;
&#13;
 issues.&#13;
&#13;
           The other point I want to just mention is in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of growth, and precisely Mr. Lvin's comments&#13;
&#13;
 encapsulates for me the dichotomy, the dilemmas that we&#13;
&#13;
 faced on this road.   Because when we in the Bank use the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 word "growth", immediately people on the other side, in&#13;
&#13;
 civil society read neo-liberal agenda.&#13;
&#13;
           When we don't mention the word "growth", when we&#13;
&#13;
 don't mention the word "growth" ten times in the opening&#13;
&#13;
 sentence, people read you have gone soft, mushy, you know,&#13;
&#13;
 this, that and the other.      It is all targeted, it is all&#13;
&#13;
 this sort of stuff.&#13;
&#13;
           And it is that dichotomy, it is precisely that&#13;
&#13;
 dichotomy that we want to get over; otherwise, we are&#13;
&#13;
 always going to be just saying you say growth, I say this,&#13;
&#13;
 you say whatever and so on.&#13;
&#13;
           And analytically that is the point, we do have&#13;
&#13;
 the basis for building that bridge.         And I think I want to&#13;
&#13;
 go further than what Joe said, which is you can have pro-&#13;
&#13;
 poor growth or non-pro-poor growth.         That is fine.   But&#13;
&#13;
 that is still saying we have growth over here, and it can&#13;
&#13;
 have distributive characteristics and that leads to&#13;
&#13;
 distribution outcomes over here.        So, there is a branch of&#13;
&#13;
 government which deals with growth, there is a branch of&#13;
&#13;
 the government which deals gender, equity and all those&#13;
&#13;
 sorts of things.&#13;
&#13;
           And it is precisely that dichotomy, which&#13;
&#13;
 certainly at the level of theory cannot be sustained, at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the level of empirical analysis cannot be sustained.         And&#13;
&#13;
 I think in terms of the Bank's own dialogue where with our&#13;
&#13;
 partners cannot be sustained because if we continue on&#13;
&#13;
 that road, we are going to be back to when you say growth,&#13;
&#13;
 we read neo-liberal growth, and when you don't say growth&#13;
&#13;
 ten times, we read you are going soft.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think we have to bridge that gap by&#13;
&#13;
 explicitly saying we reject the dichotomy between growth&#13;
&#13;
 type issues and distribution type issues.          It is what is&#13;
&#13;
 the mix of policies which are going to give you both.         So,&#13;
&#13;
 I think that is what we have to do.&#13;
&#13;
           I am going to stop there, Joe.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STIGLITZ:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           I hope we have a chance to continue this&#13;
&#13;
 discussion as we go on.&#13;

            This transcript, from the session of the
            Executive Directors of the International Bank on
