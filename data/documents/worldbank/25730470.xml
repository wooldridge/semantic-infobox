Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law.  Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;

applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;

finance terrorist activities, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;

that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset&#13;

Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be commingled&#13;
with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the&#13;
funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollar (the "Holding&#13;

Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;
the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;
it may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion.&#13;

external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an external&#13;

7.2    The Bank shall calculate a fee each time funds (the "Grant Amount") from the Trust Fund become&#13;
committed under a Grant Agreement. Such commitment shall occur when such Grant Agreement is fully&#13;
countersigned (the "Calculation Date"). The fee so calculated by the Bank shall be based on the cumulative&#13;
total of funds from the Trust Fund committed under all Grant Agreements that have been fully countersigned&#13;
on or prior to the Calculation Date (the "Cumulative Grant Total"). The calculated fee shall depend on&#13;
where the Cumulative Grant Total stands as the Grant Amount is added and shall be determined in&#13;

equal to US$ 50 million; plus&#13;

Fund net of the related fee.&#13;

Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under any Grant Agreements.&#13;
