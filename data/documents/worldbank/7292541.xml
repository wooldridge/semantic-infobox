                             A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE&#13;
&#13;
1. Countryand Sector Issues&#13;
&#13;
1. Avian inJuenza: Outbreaks o fhighlypathogenic avianinfluenza (HPAI)causedbythe H5N1&#13;
    subtype o f influenza "A" were first recognized in Hong Kong in 1997. Since late 2003, this&#13;
    subtype has been spreading at an alarming rate, from East Asia to Central Asia, and now to&#13;
    the Middle East, Europe, Afnca, and South Asia. In addition to its impact on animal health,&#13;
    with millions o f domestic poultry having died or been destroyed worldwide, H5N1 has been&#13;
    causing severe human disease. Of the known 258 humans with confirmed HPAI as o f&#13;
    November 2006, most (154) have died. The rapidly expanding area inwhich HPAI has been&#13;
    discovered and the escalating number o f human infections have raised concerns worldwide&#13;
    over the possible evolution o f the next influenza pandemic and its disastrous consequences.'&#13;
&#13;
2. Afghanistan 's risk status: As a result o f a quarter-century o f devastating civil stnfe andhalf a&#13;
    decade o f senous drought, Afghanistan has some o f the poorest social, economic and health&#13;
    indicators in the world with high susceptibility to communicable diseases. Inadequate&#13;
    facilities and capacities to detect, control, contain and mitigate an outbreak o f commucable&#13;
    disease have made this country highly vulnerable. 26 confirmed cases o f H5N1 virus in&#13;
    sampled chicken in 4 provinces have been reported since testing started inMarch 2006. The&#13;
    virus - which was first diagnosed in the province o f Nangahar - appeared to be spreading&#13;
    fast, with infection occumng in five new provinces in close succession (Kabul, Laghman,&#13;
    Logar, Parwan and Kapisa). However, since bird migration stopped inMay, there have been&#13;
    no further outbreaks o f AHID in Afghmstan. Bird migration will normally restart by&#13;
    October andpreparedness will beparticularly important dunngthe following six months.&#13;
&#13;
3. National Preparedness Plan. In March 2006, an inter-sectoral Task Force prepares a&#13;
    National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan&#13;
     (ANIPPRP) formally endorsed by the Government o f Afghanistan (GOA).' After prepanng&#13;
    the plan, the Government requested the World Bank assistance to finance the Plan. The&#13;
    ANIPPRP provides a strong basis on w h c h to detect and combat possible outbreaks, and&#13;
     outlines the institutional mechmsms for doing so. The plan i s candid about what capacity&#13;
     and resource constraints exist. The ANIPPRP was later supplemented with an Operational&#13;
     Plan, which formed the basis for the World Bank appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
' Avian  influenza (also called avian flu or bud flu) refers to a group of differentinfluenzaviruses that primarily&#13;
affect birds.An influenzapandemchappens when a new subtype emergesthat has notpreviously cuculatedm&#13;
humans.IfH5N1adapts mto a straln that is contagious amonghumans, it will no longer be a budvms but a human&#13;
influenzavirus.&#13;
* A National Avian Influenza Comrmttee (NAIC) was established as soon as the Mimster MA1 confirmed the&#13;
existence HPAI (H5N1). Membership of NAIC mcludes MAI, Mimstry of Public Health (MOPH), Mitllstry o f&#13;
Commerce (MOC), Ministry of Finance (MOF, and the Mimstry of Envuonmental Protection (MEP),&#13;
representativesof concerneddonors and implementingorgarmations suchas FAO, USAID, USDA, EU, ADB, WB,&#13;
WHO and UNICEF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4. Recent actions taken: Under the Plan the Mimstry o f Agnculture and h g a t i o n (MAI)&#13;
   adopted a policy o f slaughtenng birds in the vicinity o f all proven outbreaks o f H5N1 and&#13;
   payment o f compensation to farmers concerned. This policy was initiated under the FA0&#13;
   supported Avian Influenza Response Project ( A m ) and, as a result o f the 26 diagnosed&#13;
   cases, about thirty thousand birds were slaughtered. Since then, eight regional emergency&#13;
   centers have been established for handlingavian influenza (AI) (Kabul, Nangahar, Kandahar,&#13;
   Herat, Bamayan, Balkh Kunduz and Ghazni). Intensive training has been provided to&#13;
   provincial vetennary directors and training courses on AI awareness have been organized for&#13;
   285 vetennanans. h t i a l supplies o f equipment, protective clothing and flu detector antigen&#13;
   have been distributed and a surveillance program has been initiated based on 2 percent&#13;
   monthly samplingo fpoultry flocks in each regonal center.&#13;
&#13;
5. Status ofthe Animal HeaZth Services: The Department o f Vetennary Services (DVS) i s a part&#13;
   o f MA1 and is headed by the Director o f Vetennary Services/Chief Vetennary Officer&#13;
   (CVO). The MA1vetennary service i s poorly equipped and has no budget for addressing&#13;
   regulatory and public-good functions related to animal health, including trans-boundary&#13;
   disease control, zoonotic disease control, disease surveillance, food safety, and quality&#13;
   control o f vaccines and medicines. Transport and telecommunications are weak and there i s&#13;
   no organized disease-information system. There are insufficient graduate vetennanans for&#13;
   providing an effective presence inall provinces o f the country; salanes for MA1vetennanans&#13;
   are extremely low and sometimes delayed.&#13;
&#13;
6. Status ofthe Public HeaZthcare Services: Until the end o f 2003, the performance o f the&#13;
   public health system was poor. Since the beginning o f 2004, there appears to have been a&#13;
   large increase in service delivery, about 90 percent o f it provided by NGOs. A rudimentary&#13;
   disease surveillance systembased on a Health Management Information System (HMIS) and&#13;
   reports from vertical programs such as tuberculosis and vaccine-preventable childhood&#13;
   diseases exists in Afghanistan. However, the quality and completeness are vanable and&#13;
   utilizing this system for avian and pandemic influenza surveillance would be unreliable, due&#13;
   to weak data accuracy. The best functioning disease surveillance system in Afghanistan i s&#13;
   the acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)/poliomyelitis system.         It is supported by WHO in&#13;
   collaboration with the MOPH. This system has an extensive grass-roots infrastructure&#13;
   throughout Afghanistan, has timely reporting, i s coupled with specimen collection and rapid&#13;
   shipment, and has a ngorous response component. Rapid response teams that conduct case or&#13;
   outbreak investigations are present in each province.        As needed, these teams can be&#13;
   supplemented by national level personnel.      Some training o f personnel on these teams&#13;
   regarding avian influenza (including specimen collection) has been conducted, but their&#13;
   ability and capacity to adequately respond i s largely untested and they have limited&#13;
   equipment and transport.&#13;
&#13;
7 Diagnostic Capacity - Animal Health: Diagnostic capacity for animal health i s very limited&#13;
   but several efforts are under way with funding and technical assistance from European&#13;
   Commission (EC), UnitedStates Department o f Agnculture (USDA), and Japan International&#13;
   Cooperation Agency (JICA). FA0 initiated a trans-boundary disease-surveillance program in&#13;
   Afghanistan, which i s part o f broader regional efforts in Central and South Asia. The&#13;
   program established an enzym-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) test laboratory At the&#13;
   same time, the third US naval medical research unit (NAMRU-3) has provided the MA1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   laboratory in Kabul with real-time reverse transcnptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-&#13;
  PCR) equipment to screen samples for Avian Influenza. The FA0 laboratory provides the&#13;
   necessary HPAI diagnostic services through the following diagnostic tests: (i)   RRT-PCR for&#13;
   identification o f H5, (ii)ELISA for antibodies against type A, (iii)HI3for detection o f&#13;
   antibodies against H 7 andH9, and (iv) AGID4test for antibodies against H 7 andH9.&#13;
&#13;
8. Dzagnostic Capacity - Human Health: Laboratory diagnostic capacity for human health in&#13;
   Afghmstan i s very limited. Under the BPHS, no lab services are offered at health posts or&#13;
   BHCs. CHCs and distnct hospitals offer basic hematology, unnalysis, and biochemical&#13;
   assays. They are able to perform gram stains for bactenology and acid fast smears for&#13;
   tuberculosis. However, more advanced health care facilities are unable to perform&#13;
   microbiologic cultures, and instead rely on gram stains and smears. As a result, most&#13;
   infectious diseases diagnoses are based on clinical impression, although serologic diagnosis&#13;
   through blood collection is performed for some diseases. For influenza, FA0 has established&#13;
   diagnostic capacity in the vetennary diagnostic laboratory o f the Ministry o f Agnculture.&#13;
   Arrangements are inplace for this facility to test human specimens when necessary There&#13;
   are also arrangements to refer specimens to the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office&#13;
   (EMRO) o f WHO and the collaborating laboratory o f the U.S. Naval Medical Research Urut&#13;
   (NAMRU)No. 3 in Cairo. NAMRU-3 is inthe process o f developing virology capacity in&#13;
   the Central Laboratory o f the Ministry of Public Health, including influenza facility&#13;
   renovation, RT-PCR diagnostics and virus isolation.&#13;
&#13;
2. Rationale for IDA involvement&#13;
&#13;
9  Bank involvement i s justified by the global public good aspect o f the HPAI, one of many&#13;
   emerging and re-emerging transboundary zoonoses. A human flu pandemic could cause&#13;
   significant increases in poverty in developing countnes. To be effective, the response&#13;
   requires coordination across countnes and agencies at the international and regional levels&#13;
   and close intra-ministry coordination in each participating county. Inmost instances it also&#13;
   requires substantial financial resources. The Bank i s well placed to work inthis environment,&#13;
   in partnership with international technical agencies, other multilateral agencies and donor&#13;
   countnes.&#13;
&#13;
10.The Bank has endorsed the FAO/OIE Global Strategy to minimize the global threat and nsk&#13;
   o f HPAI in domestic poultry and humans through progressive control and eradication o f&#13;
   HPAI, particularly that caused by H5N1 virus from terrestnal domestic poultry Furthermore&#13;
   the Bank, in collaboration with the EU, WHO, FAO, OIE and bilateral donors, has&#13;
   established a multi-donor trust fund for Avian and Human Influenza (AHITF) that pnmarily&#13;
   supports country level activities in conjunction with a smaller and complementary role at the&#13;
   regional and global levels. National level activities for progressive control and eradication o f&#13;
   the HPAI are a fundamental buildingblock to global eradication. The Bank has been working&#13;
   with national governments, FAO, OIE, WHO, EU, other partners and bi-and multilateral&#13;
   agencies inthe preparationo fNational AI Preparedness Plan and strategies.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
11.The HPAI control and eradication programs are complex and require a multi-disciplinary&#13;
   approach to integrate technical, social, economic, political and regulatory issues. The Bank i s&#13;
   well placed to draw on its vast expenence throughout the world in multi disciplinary&#13;
   approaches to tackle similar emergency preparedness, nsk-mitigation and other projects and&#13;
   programs requinng multi-disciplinary approaches. In addition, the Bank has comparative&#13;
    advantage in having swift access to its own financial resources to support emergency&#13;
   preparedness and response projects. The Bank is an active member o f the NAIS and has&#13;
   demonstrated its capability to bnngtogether relevant and important national and international&#13;
   institutions in support o f a national preparedness plan. The Bank, recognizing the importance&#13;
    o f the poultry sector, has included a component for semi-intensive poultry production in the&#13;
   recently approved Horticulture and Livestock Project (P098256, HLP).&#13;

&#13;
1. ProjectDevelopmentObjective&#13;
&#13;
12. The overall objective o f the Project i s to mimmize the threat posed by HPAI to humans in&#13;
    Afghanistan by controlling such infections among birds, especially domestic poultry, and&#13;
   prepanng for, controlling, and responding to possible human infections, especially an&#13;
    influenza epidemic and related emergencies. Though the objective is specific to HPAI, the&#13;
    interventions are expected to contribute to the control o f other zoonotic diseases and other&#13;
   types o f infectious diseases, interms o fbuildingoverall response capacity&#13;
&#13;
13. This objective will be achieved through three types of interventions: (i)prevention; (ii)&#13;
    preparedness and planning; and (iii)  response and containment. Ifthese types o f interventions&#13;
    achieve their goals, the proposed project will reduce the burden o f disease in animal and the&#13;
    consequent economic losses. It will also lower the nsk o f human infection and the loss o f&#13;
    productivity attributable to human infections in Afghanistan. Finally, it would limit the nsk&#13;
    of HPAI inother countnes.&#13;
&#13;
14. At the end o f the project it i s expected that (i)&#13;
                                                      the capacity o f the agencies involved in AI&#13;
    containment, control andmitigationwill have significantly improved, (ii) threat to human&#13;
                                                                               the&#13;
    health in the high nsks provinces o f Afghanistan will have been substantially reduced, and&#13;

&#13;
2. FinancialInstrument&#13;
&#13;
15 The project will be implemented over three years for a total cost o f US$ 13 million. IDA will&#13;
    finance US$8 million and the Avian and HumanInfluenza Trust Fund (AHITF) will finance&#13;
    US$5.0 million.&#13;
&#13;
16. The IDA Grant is proposed under the Global Program for Avian Influenza and Human&#13;
    Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI, approved by the Board on January 12, 2006).&#13;
    Under the GPAI framework, all new IDA financing preparedwill follow APL procedures for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

    follow-on operations.' GPAI operations are also processed as emergency and recovery&#13;
    operations (ERLs) under OPBP 8.50.&#13;
&#13;
17 AHITF cofinancing i s expected to be made available within six months from effectiveness of&#13;
    the proposed IDA Grantunder the same applicable Bankpolicies, practices, andstandards.6&#13;
&#13;
3. Project Components&#13;
&#13;
18. The project will finance activities under four components: (i)                Ammal Health, (ii)      Human&#13;

46. The extent to which the project will be able to assist farmers throughout the country depends&#13;
    on the secunty situation. Secunty remains problematic in several provinces because o f the&#13;
    limited extent o f government authonty Aid agencies can face threats from cnme, inter-&#13;
    warlord nvalnes, and opponents to the government. The secunty situation in the country is&#13;
    at its worst since the fall o f the Taliban regime, and it i s not clear how it will evolve in the&#13;
    next coming years. k s k is particularly hgh in the South. Preliminary operations o f the&#13;
    project have therefore been designedto avoid areas ofpersistent nsk.&#13;
&#13;
47 No controversial aspects are foreseen.&#13;

Management Manual satisfactory to the Association has been prepared and adopted for the&#13;
Project; (ii)a financial management officer for the Project has been appointed withn MAI; (5)&#13;
the Implementation Support Team has been constituted and staffed with an adequate number o f&#13;

Procedures Manual and an Environmental Management Plan satisfactory to the Bank have been&#13;
adopted by the government&#13;
&#13;
50. Before effectiveness, the Minister o f Justice should prepare and submit to the Bank a legal&#13;
opinion stating that the Financing Agreement has been executed and ratified in accordance with&#13;
the laws o f Afghanistan. In addition, the cofinancing agreement between IDA (as administrator&#13;
for the Avian and Human Influenza Trust Fund) and the government o f Afghanistan should have&#13;

                                     D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1. Economicand FinancialAnalyses&#13;
&#13;
5 1 In terms o f savings or prevention o f losses from further outbreaks o f HPAIthe returns to the&#13;
    proposed investment are substantial. Using conservative assumptions, the total investment o f&#13;
    US$12.7 million, could prevent an estimated cumulative loss o f about US$200 million over&#13;
    the next 10 years. Infinancial terms an average o f about US$18 million per annum o f losses&#13;
    preventedmay be significant in itself but these losses would affect the poorest and the most&#13;
    vulnerable households inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
52. The economic analysis uses the standardcost-benefit analysis method to estimate the avoided&#13;
    losses in with-project situation. Without project and AI outbreak would have a significant&#13;
    negative impact on the poultry sector and humans, using the impact parameters from WHO&#13;
    and FAO/OIE (See Appendix 5 for more details). The with-project scenano assumes that the&#13;
    negative impact o f the disease would be minimized over the course o f the project, leading to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   reduced costs to the stakeholders and the economy as a whole. The benefits in terms of&#13;
   humanhealth and the poultry sector are significant and robust, suggesting the financial and&#13;
    economic viability o f the project. The sensitivity analysis shows that the project benefits are&#13;
   robust and do not change even with significant changes in the assumptions and parameters&#13;
    (Appendix 5). Nevertheless, the assigned probabilities, as cntical parameters for estimating&#13;
    costs and benefits with and without project scenanos are estrmates and not statistically&#13;
    denved. Any interpretation o f the economic analyses should therefore be correspondingly&#13;
    cautious.&#13;
&#13;
53. Some notable and highly relevant direct and indirect costs related to a possible AI outbreak&#13;
   have been disregarded in the analysis, in view o f the uncertainties in extent o f correlation,&#13;
    lack o f appropnate data and information. Following field visits to a number o f affected and&#13;
   highlyvulnerable provinces, the preparationmission found that manytraders and the nascent&#13;
   poultry farms have incurred significant costs and many have beenindebted as a result of the&#13;
    minor outbreak early in2006.&#13;
&#13;
54. Alternative sources o f income are limited and in Afghanistan any loss o f income from the&#13;
   poultry sector will have significant food insecunty repercussions. Poultry is also one of the&#13;
   most significant sources o f income for the landless. Therefore, the project's aim to help&#13;
    control and contain the spread o f AI will benefit pnmarily the relatively poorer members o f&#13;
   the society&#13;
&#13;
2. Technical&#13;
&#13;
55 The proposed Project involves a large set o f technical issues involving capacity o f vetennary&#13;
    services, laboratory facilities, bio-secunty measures, epidemiological .expertise, and&#13;
    emergency response to avian influenza outbreaks and a possible pandemic. These technical&#13;
    issues are elaborated inAppendix 2 (Detailed Project Descnption).&#13;
&#13;
3. Fiduciary&#13;
&#13;
56. The decision to align with the government's systems and procedures for implementing all&#13;
    components will contribute to enhancing institutional capacity While the overall fiduciary&#13;
    nsk associated with the Project is rated as "High h s k " for financial management and&#13;
    procurement, the proposed nsk mitigation action plans are deemed to be adequate (see Annex&#13;
    6 and 7 for details). Efforts will be made for capacity building in project coordination that&#13;
    includes procurement and financial management.&#13;
&#13;
4. Social&#13;
&#13;
57 Although poultry i s not a major commercial or economic activity, in Afghanistan, backyard&#13;
    chickens are an important livelihood, income and food secunty issue for the rural poor and&#13;
    especially for female-headed households. Nearly 98 percent o f the poultry sector i s owned&#13;
    and managed by women as one of the very few economic activities accessible to women.&#13;
    Therefore, interventions in the poultry sector will disproportionately benefit the most&#13;
    vulnerable section o f the society and positively contribute to addressing the gender bias in&#13;
    society, representinga significant positive social impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. Environmental&#13;
&#13;
58. The Project is assesszd as Category B for environmental impact. Project activities are&#13;
    expected to generate no or limited adverse environmental effects, since most activities are&#13;
    designed to support preventive measures. The Project will, generally, have positive&#13;
    environmental and social impacts as investments in facilities, equipment, laboratones, and&#13;
    training will improve the effectiveness and safety o f existing avian influenza handling and&#13;
    testing procedures. This would be reinforced by the mainstreaming of environmental&#13;
    safeguards through protocols and procedures for the culling and disposal o f ammals dung&#13;
    AI outbreaks and decontamination o f production facilities, and laboratones. However,&#13;
    adverse environmental health impacts, mainly unintentional from the spread o f HPAI, could&#13;
    occur when an emergency operation involves containment o f outbreaks through quarantine,&#13;
    isolation and culling actions and when relevant mitigation measures are not inplace. Most of&#13;
    the key potential impacts will be avoided or minimized by routinely integrating&#13;
    environmental and public health safety aspects dunngproject implementation.&#13;

&#13;
Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The project will support the national program for HPAIprevention, containment, control,&#13;
and eradication activities in the livestock and public health sectors. These activities&#13;
reflect an assessment o f the particular nsks, conditions, constraints, needs and&#13;
possibilities in the country, including a rapid assessment o f the public health and&#13;
vetennary services and poultry production systems, and reviews by donor agencies and&#13;
institutions involved with AI.&#13;
&#13;
A. AnimalHealthComponent&#13;
&#13;
A.1. StrengtheningHPAI Controland OutbreakContainmentCapacity&#13;
&#13;
Project support for HPAI outbreak containment actions reflects the provisions in the&#13;
NAIPPRPand associated implementation guidelines andmanuals. Project financing will&#13;
be provided for activities relatedto the implementation o f the NAIPPRP which specifies&#13;
the responsibilities and functions o f the National and Provincial Committees on AI&#13;
Control, the line ministnes involved, and implementing partners. It also defines the&#13;
responsibilities o f the zone offices and the teams that will be formed and trained now&#13;
and activated in any location where an outbreak is suspected andor confirmed. For&#13;
animal health, this will pnmarily involve the Vetennary Services Department (VSD) o f&#13;
MAI.&#13;
&#13;
Targeting Virus Eradication at the Source. The overnding objective for vetennary&#13;
services i s to detect and contain any outbreak o f AI and to eradicate the disease at the&#13;
source of infection. Several activities are directly linked with this objective and&#13;
accordingly, the sub-component will provide support for: (i) detection o f virus&#13;
                                                                  early&#13;
among the poultry population; (ii) response in order to suppress viral activities in&#13;
                                     early&#13;
the identified outbreaks by means o f culling o f infected and at-nsk poultry (stamping&#13;
out) through emergency response teams, (iii)       compensating farmers and commercial&#13;
poultry producers (at rates prescribed by the National Avian Influenza Secretanat -&#13;
NAIS), (iv) disposingo f carcasses and potentially infective matenals ina bio-secure and&#13;
environmentally acceptable manner, (v) enhancing bio-secunty at poultry farms and&#13;
associated premises through bio-containment and bio-exclusion; (vi) controlling the&#13;
movement o f birds and products that may be infected, including controls at the interface&#13;
of infectednon-infected areas and border controls, and (vii) providing nng vaccination&#13;
for all poultry within restncted and control areas after completing culling operations.&#13;
&#13;
Project financing will provide for the technical and logistical means to Emergency&#13;
Response Teams (ERTs) to contain a HPAI outbreak through location quarantining and&#13;
culling o f affected animals in infected and dangerous contact places. Culling and carcass&#13;
disposal will be done under the supervision o f zonal vetennanans or contracted pnvate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 vetennanans, who will be assisted by properly trained, equipped and protected staff&#13;
 (governmenthetennary field units - VFU staff and laborers) hued for*thispurpose by&#13;
 VSD o f the zone. Equipment and matenals will be provided for efficient and humane&#13;
 animal destruction as well as for the safe disposal o f carcasses. Carcass disposal will be&#13;
 case-specific, depending on local circumstances, but inall cases inan authonzed andbio-&#13;
 environmentally safe manner. Manuals will be developed in local languages and culling&#13;
 teams will receive proper training in human safety measures, humane killing and&#13;
 environmentally safe disposalldestruction o f biological and solid waste matenals.&#13;
 Protective clothing and other gear will be procured and kept in ready supply at zonal&#13;
 offices, to be issued incase o f an outbreak to all staff and workers involved incontainmg&#13;
 it. Detailedrecords will bemaintained o f all w a l s culled, so as to prowde the basis for&#13;
 subsequent compensation to their owners.&#13;
&#13;
 For backyard poultry operations, the culling will be done in the presence and under the&#13;
 "social supervision" of a small local committee that includes two trusted members o f the&#13;
 village community (of which preferable one will be a woman) as well as the local&#13;
 vetennanan.      Community representatives may be the Mullah, members o f the&#13;
 Community Development Council (CDC), a representative o f the Women Poultry Group,&#13;
 or other locally recognized and trusted community members. This committee will venfy&#13;
 the number o f birds culled and their owners, so as to ensure a correct count and f i l l&#13;
 transparency for subsequent compensation payments. The commission members will&#13;
 sign and the poultry owners will countersignthe list o f birds culled.&#13;
&#13;
 At (semi-)commercial poultry farms, the culling will be carned out in.the presence o f the&#13;
 owner or manager or o f a person designated by himher and under the supervision o f the&#13;
 zonal vetennanan and one official o f the local administration. All three will sign the list&#13;
 o fbirds culled.&#13;
&#13;
 Along with the project activities the staff members o f the ERTs will undertake filed&#13;
 simulation exercises in order to test the correct implementation o f the established&#13;
 procedures.&#13;
&#13;
 Vaccination: Poultry vaccination on a large scale as a preventivemeasure i s not foreseen&#13;
 at the present time. Lessons learned from the epizootic occurred in March-April 2006&#13;
 showed -that the disease, if present, i s likely to move slowly within the poultry&#13;
 population. This might be mainly due to the low population density o f poultry and to the&#13;
 fact that 98% of the poultry population i s in the rural sector (with an estimated average&#13;
 size of 6 animals/family), meaning that there are no big aggregation o f birds per&#13;
 epidemiological unit that can sustain the survival o f the virus. In addition the vetennary&#13;
,system (government and pnvate) i s not presently equipped to implement large-scale&#13;
 poultry vaccination campaigns7, the secunty situation in many parts o f the country not&#13;
 conducive to large-scale vaccination campaigns. Vaccination can however take place on&#13;
 a regular basis for the semi-commercial layer farms and pullet-reanng farms, which&#13;
 provide birds to the rural sector, as well as the birds supplied via Rural Poultry&#13;
 Development ProjectsPrograms. Provisions have been made in the budget to do so. In&#13;
&#13;
 'The annual import of Newcastle disease vaccine is reported to be 2 milliondoses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
,the face o f an outbreak and inorder to prevent hrther spread o f disease, the project will&#13;
  undertake nng vaccinations, after culling, if required. Each zone will receive adequate&#13;
  stock o fvaccines to carry out nngvaccinations.&#13;
&#13;
  Whenever vaccination is going to be implemented a vaccination monitonng scheme has&#13;
  to be developed in order to momtor: (i)  efficacy o f vaccine; and (ii) incursion o f&#13;
                                                                        detect&#13;
 virus in vaccinated flocks. The latter is usually achieved by leaving some unvaccinated&#13;
  birds invaccinated flocks. Evenif such method is culturally unacceptable inthe Afghan&#13;
  rural setting this might be applied in the commercial and semi-commercial sector. The&#13;
  project will support active and passive sero-surveillance programs in vaccinated birds,&#13;
  distributed through the FA0 implemented Rural Poultry Development project&#13;
  (GCP/AFG/030/USA), in order to assess the level o f protection after vaccination and to&#13;
  monitor vaccinated birds for possible infection with HPAI. These activities will i.a. be&#13;
  carned out with the assistance o f female (para)vetennanans/CBAHWs and poultry&#13;
  trainers.&#13;
&#13;
  After the initial emergency phase, dunng which poultry farmers are to be financially&#13;
  compensated for culled birds, a restocking scheme with vaccinated birds, based on the&#13;
  Afghan Rural Poultry Development Model, could be established as a mechanism within&#13;
  the compensation facility&#13;
&#13;
  Activities in support of sub-component A.l (cost Table 1in project files):&#13;
&#13;
        A.1.a. In order to face avian influenza emergency situations, the Project will&#13;
        support eight regonal ERTs. Each Team will be composed o f four vetennanans,&#13;
        who will be equipped with all necessary matenal to carry out field investigation and&#13;
        culling operations. The provisional list o f minimum required equipment i s as&#13;
        follows: rapid tests, personal protection equipment sets (PPEs), disinfectants,&#13;
        sprayers, motonzed mist blowers, autopsy kits, culling bags, C02cylinders, GPS,&#13;
        cell phones,   maps, laboratory equipment for samples collection, storage&#13;
        (refngerators and freezers) and sample transportation (liquid nitrogen tanks and&#13;
        cool boxes).&#13;
&#13;
        A.1.b. Training for the ERTs. Teams will be provided with technical operation&#13;
        manuals on samples collection, storage and transportation, outbreaks investigation,&#13;
        methods for culling and disposal o f carcasses.&#13;
&#13;
        A.1.c. Field simulation exercises will be organized for ERTs to check if emergency&#13;
        procedures could be duly implemented.&#13;
&#13;
        A.l.d. Procurement o f vaccine for emergency and for regular vaccination programs&#13;
        in the commercial and semi-commercial sector. It is estimated that the maximum&#13;
        amount o f vaccine to be purchased along with project activities i s up to 6,000,000&#13;
        individualdoses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      A.1.e. Establishment and.implementation o f procedures to momtor the efficacy o f&#13;
      the vaccine and to establish a monitonng program in commercial vaccinated flocks&#13;
      inorder to be able to detect earlyincursions ofthe virus.&#13;
&#13;
      A.1.f. The project will procure a number o f station wagons, pick ups, motor&#13;
      bicycles and truck in order to carry out timely and effectively above mentioned&#13;
      activities inthe country&#13;
&#13;
A.2 -Human       Safety Assurance. The project will support the provision o f traimng to&#13;
people likely to be in direct contact with birds that may carry AI. Ths includes&#13;
vetennary and extension field staff involved inidentification o f the disease, farm workers&#13;
involved in culling and waste disposal, and laboratory workers involved invirus isolation&#13;
and diagnosis.      Resources will be allocated for extensive field training* in order to&#13;
enhance the level o f awareness. Equipment (bio-safety hoods and appropnate personal&#13;
protective gear and clothing) will also be provided and inaddition, all vetennary staff and&#13;
workers involved in emergency response teams and laboratory staff involved in HPAI&#13;
diagnostic activities will be vaccinated against seasonal humaninfluenza.&#13;
&#13;
Activities in supportof sub-component A.2:&#13;
&#13;
        A.2.a. Extensive training activities will be camed out by ERTs for field&#13;
        vetennanans, field staff and farm workers on recoption o f avian influenza and&#13;
        procedures o f self-protection in case o f handling suspected birds. Training will&#13;
        include the procedures o f activation o f the ERTs. Each ERT will carry out three&#13;
        training sessions per year inorder to cover the relevant satellite provinces.&#13;
&#13;
        A.2.b. Provision of PPEs for the ERTs, trainees, and State Vetennary Department&#13;
        (SVD) staff. The Project will procure 10,000 (ten thousand) units composed of&#13;

Strengthening Disease Surveillance Capacity. Project financing will provide for&#13;
supporting MA1 vetennary services and VFUs nationwide through specific operating&#13;
procedures for all staff inthe detection and reporting o f clinical HPAI disease. This will&#13;
be based on the guidelines as developed by FAO/OIE and will include building capacity&#13;
of public and pnvate vetennary services, throughprovision o f training programs inactive&#13;
and passive epidemiological surveillance and disease reporting, in order to combat major&#13;
trans-boundary animal diseases including AI. This sub-component will expand the&#13;
activities already initiated and build on the expenences and lessons learnt fiom the FA0&#13;
implementedAN?, which is providing a bndging project between the AI surveillance&#13;
component o f the FA0 Regional Trans-boundary Animal Diseases project and the AHIP&#13;

project. The surveillance program i s implemented at the moment in (formerly) infected&#13;
and neighbonng distncts and at live bird markets in established nsk areas. The&#13;
preliminary results o f the program are presently under evaluation but it can be anticipated&#13;
that the results so far obtained didnot evidence the presence o f HPAIinthe study areas.&#13;
&#13;
The program was structured infour main sub-components: (i)      rural areas; (ii)&#13;
                                                                                commercial&#13;
and semi-commercial sector; (iii)wetlands; and (iv) live birds markets. The same&#13;
approach could also be used inthe present project extending the activities throughout the&#13;
country Project financing will be provided for regular epidemiologcal studies and active&#13;
and passive surveillance programs in commercial and smallholder poultry. This will&#13;
support the process o f improving disease control measures, and will allow for&#13;
adjustments and refinements as new information becomes available. This activity will&#13;
also support Afghanistan's participation in the regional HPAI network and will enable&#13;
disease information shanng. Studies to support the surveillance component will be&#13;
implemented by the project and include, i.a., poultry density mapping exercises to&#13;
support nsk assessments and establishment o f sample sizes for epidemiological surveys.&#13;
Following these studies, VFUs will be contracted to carry out surveillance work e.g. (bi-&#13;
)weekly random sampling at live-bird markets, commercial and semi-commercial sectors&#13;
intheir service areas. Government and pnvate service providers will be remunerated for&#13;
both passive and active surveillance activities. It is foreseen that surveillance in rural&#13;
poultry will be carned out by female (para)vetennanans/CBAHWs.&#13;
&#13;
UDdatina Essential Information on Migratory Birds. The Government intends to assess&#13;
flight and resting patterns o f migratory birds, especially waterfowl.      To this end the&#13;
project management will liaise with the National Environmental Program for Afghanistan&#13;
(NEPA) to determine migratory bird species in the country In this context, project&#13;
financing will provide for: (i)supporting activities by an ornithologist to classify&#13;
migratory bird species; (ii) active surveillance program invillages around 15 identified&#13;
                                 an&#13;
wetlandsg in order to carry out nsk assessments at locations where migratory fowl may&#13;
come into contact with domestic poultry and humans; and (iii)      surveillance activities in&#13;
wild birdsthrough observation o f the clinical status and collection o f samples from target&#13;
species adopting methodologies that will not affect protection o f wildlife and&#13;
safeguarding biodiversity. Active reporting will be stimulated via the FA0 installed&#13;
CODAN radio network, which i s to date operating in 32 provinces o f Afghanistan. The&#13;
remaining two provinces, not yet covered by the system, will receive a CODAN radio&#13;
shortly&#13;
&#13;
Strengthening Diagnostic Capacity. Project support through this sub-component will&#13;
be targeted pnmarily at strengthening the capacity o f the Central Vetennary Laboratory&#13;
and public and pnvate field staff, in detection, reporting, sample collection and&#13;
submission, and follow-up of reported AI cases.          This will involve initial training&#13;
followed by active surveillance activities. Essential equipment for the central laboratory&#13;
and rapid tests for regional laboratones, as well as consumables and reagents, will be&#13;
financed. Staff training and technical assistance will be provided to establish rapid&#13;
institutional capacity for serological tests and screening surveys, and for virology tests to&#13;
&#13;
  Serological surveys carried out inDec 2005 -Jan 2006.&#13;

&#13;
       A.3.a. Training and review the regulatory and legslation framework and&#13;
                                                              2&#13;

       development of guidelines for compensation scheme.&#13;
&#13;
       A.3.b. Improvement o f information system is an essential component o f the&#13;
       surveillance system, which will be enhanced through the procurement o f different&#13;
       items aimed at improving the capacity o f the State Vetennary Department to&#13;
       rationalize information collected through surveillance system. Training will also&#13;
       be provided on the implementation o f an ad-hoc information system.&#13;
&#13;
       A.3.c. In order to strengthen disease surveillance capacity, training and&#13;
       preparation o f guidelines and manuals will be provided for investigating diseases&#13;
       inthe sub-component identified (rural, commercial and semi-commercial sectors,&#13;
       livebirdsmarkets and wetlands).&#13;
&#13;
       A.3.d. Remunerationfor the vetennmans involved ininvestigatingincommercial&#13;
       and semi-commercial sectors, live birds markets and wetlands. Investigations in&#13;
       commercial sector and live birds markets are to be carned out on a regular basis&#13;
       while investigations on wetlands are to be carned out mainly dunng migrating&#13;
        seasons o fwild birds.&#13;
&#13;
        A.3.e. Field vetennanans involved in surveillance activities in wetlands will&#13;
        undertake a training course on sample collection and recognition o f wild birds&#13;
        species, which are relevant to AI epidemiology&#13;
&#13;
        A.3.f. Field vetennanans involved in activities in wild life will need to be&#13;
        equipped with sample collection matenal and additional devices to capture wild&#13;
        birds.&#13;
&#13;
        A.3.g. The Central Vetennary Diagnostic Laboratory in Kabul will be provided&#13;
        with laboratory equipment, reagents and consumables in support of surveillance&#13;
        activities. Laboratory staff involved in diagnosis will undertake refreshing&#13;
        training courses on laboratory techniques.&#13;
&#13;
A. 4. Improvingthe capacityof poultry stakeholdersto adopt appropriatemeasures&#13;
to counter HPAIpresenceinAfghanistan&#13;
&#13;
Community-BasedAnimal Disease Surveillance and Early Warning. Early warning&#13;
o f suspected outbreaks o f avian influenza i s essential in curtailing spread o f the disease&#13;
and minimizing economic loss. Since the rural backyard poultry sector constitutes 98&#13;
percent o f the national flock, rural poultry raisers are the focal point to address when&#13;
early warning and disease reporting issues are concerned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
However, early warning systems at village level will only be effective if measures taken&#13;
follow established guidelines and procedures, and farmers are well and timely&#13;
compensated for loss o f healthy chickens through culling. Activities as expenenced in&#13;
Afghanistan, e.g. culling in distncts without confirmed cases o f avian influenza, are not&#13;
conducive to disease reporting, and may senously hamper containment and control of&#13;
HPAIinAfghanistaninthe near future.&#13;
&#13;
The rural poultry industry i s a female core and since most rural women in Afghanistan&#13;
are illiterate and often out o f contact with modern communication methods such as radio&#13;
or television, the method o f choice to address these women i s through personalcontact by&#13;
female poultry trainers or CBAHWs.&#13;
&#13;
To establish early warning systems at the community level to support a robust emergency&#13;
reporting and feedback system for notifiable animal diseases, the project will finance&#13;
training courses in, and implementation o f participatory disease survey techniques for&#13;
female animal health workers and women poultry trainers. Training courses will further&#13;
include handling o f infected animals, reporting procedures and immediate local response&#13;
measures. To this purpose the project will provide training courses to FAO's Women&#13;
Poultry Trainers and to female BWV, who will act as trainer o f trainers. NGOs will be&#13;
sub-contracted to implement program activities at village level through training o f&#13;
women poultry raisers. Poultry farmers will receive hands-on training in detection o f&#13;
clinical signs. Group leaders will be focal points for reporting suspected cases in those&#13;
villages where women poultry groups exist. Group leaders will be reimbursed for cost"&#13;
incurred for reporting (telephone, travel, small service fee, etc.).     Funding will be&#13;
provided for essential bio-secunty equipment such as sprayers andprotective equipment.&#13;
&#13;
Improving Bio-Security in Poultry Production. Bio-secunty is the cheapest, most&#13;
effective means o f disease control available. N o disease prevention program will work&#13;
without it. Bio-secunty i s a concept for prevention o f disease entry/escape that must be&#13;
practiced by all farmers, cooperatives, abattoirs etc. Lack o f bio-secunty measures&#13;
increases the nsk o f introducing disease or infection into the production unit, market, or&#13;
any commercial operation. Farm management practices and marketing systems influence&#13;
the probability o fpoultry beingchallenged (andbecoming infected) with HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
Smallholder households keep approximately 98 percent o f the total poultry population in&#13;
Afghanistan. Typically, smallholder households own around 6 chickens per household&#13;
and sell a bird occasionally to meet cash or domestic needs. Rural poverty i s&#13;
unfortunately expected to perpetuate high-nsk behavior through slaughtenng and/or&#13;
selling o f infectedchickens.&#13;
&#13;
The main goal o f the bio-secunty sub-component is to develop clear guidelines and to&#13;
train both commercial and backyard poultry owners in clinical signs o f senous poultry&#13;
diseases, to ask them to notify competent authonties o f occurrences o f sick and/or dead&#13;
birds, and to give them information on practicing bio-secunty measures to keep their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
loOn average US$5.0 per report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              32&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
birds safe and healthy This will be achieved through carehl assessment and planningo f&#13;
the required measures and their applicability in the Afghan context. All commercial&#13;
poultry farms should develop and implement a formal bio-secunty plan as appropnate to&#13;
the type of farm. The bio-secunty planshould be documented with clear specifications o f&#13;
those responsible for its maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
Bio-secunty practices do not have to be cumbersome or expensive. However, the&#13;
effectiveness of the measures depends on compliance by farmers and farm workers, who&#13;
must have a basic understanding of the purpose o f the measures. Breaches o f bio-secunty&#13;
can occur no matter how stnngently the measures are implemented. Therefore, this sub-&#13;
component will assess the capacity and willingness o f people to cany out bio-secunty&#13;
measures. Willingness depends on the perception o f the nsks from HPAI, the extent to&#13;
which the government i s able to enforce wntten regulations, the importance o f poultryto&#13;
the livelihood, the cost o f the recommended bio-secunty measures compared to profit&#13;
from the poultry enterpnse, and the availability o f cash to make an investment in bio-&#13;
secunty measures, when weighted against the many other demands on income.&#13;
&#13;
Improving bio-secunty in poultry production i s an important element in any strategy to&#13;
safeguard against the damaging impact o f HPAI. The project will support participatory&#13;
socio-economic needs and impact assessments o f bio-secunty measures in the poultry&#13;
sector, encompassing all stakeholders. Links should be established with the HLP project&#13;
for baseline data on bio-secunty Support will also be provided for an overall assessment&#13;
o f the poultry industry, including birds markets, and o f the opportunities for improving&#13;
bio-secunty measures to prevent spreading o f virus from infected premises and thereby&#13;
reducing the nsk o f further infection. The assessments will result in tailor-made&#13;
recommendations to enhance bio-secunty at poultry farms and associated premises,&#13;
through bio-containment and bio-exclusion and by the provision of safe carcass disposal&#13;
facilities. Appropnate technical training matenal adapted to vanous existing categones o f&#13;
poultry stakeholders will be developed. Particular emphasis will be given to the&#13;
promotion o f the Afghan Rural Poultry Development model as viable approach for bio-&#13;
secunty measures. Project management will liaise with the HLP to provide poultry&#13;
reanng training courses to HPAIaffected farmers.&#13;
&#13;
Activities in support of sub-component A.4:&#13;
&#13;
         A.4.a. Surveillance in rural areas will be carned out by trained women. This&#13;
         activity will have two main components: (i)regular surveillance in nsky areas&#13;
         (Le. around live birds markets); (ii) random surveillance in the remaining areas.&#13;
         The two activities will have different penodicity&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
AS. Compensationfacilities&#13;
&#13;
The Project has established a compensation fund for farmers in order to reimburse them&#13;
from the loss o f domestic poultry due to HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
A.6. TechnicalAssistance InternationalConsultants&#13;
                             -&#13;
&#13;
International consultants will be recruited to provide technical expertise to national staff&#13;
throughout the project.&#13;
&#13;
A.7. Waste Managementand Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
This sub-component will include the preparation o f a national plan, standard guidelines&#13;
and an operational manual for HPAI-related waste management, as well as equipment&#13;
and supplies to support healthy and environmentally fhendly disposal o f culled animals,&#13;
laboratory waste disposal and decontamination. Detailed TORS for an international&#13;
consultant to prepare guidelines and operational manuals have been prepared and are&#13;
available inthe draft Project Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B. HUMANHEALTHCOMPONENT&#13;
&#13;
B.l. EnhancingPublicHealthProgramPlanningandCoordination&#13;
&#13;
Supportfor an avian influenzacoordinatorwithin the Ministryof PublicHealth. At&#13;
present, there is no individual inMOPH responsible for coordinating activities related to&#13;
AI and human health. It is important that a senior officer be appointed since the required&#13;
elements o f human avian influenza surveillance, response, and case management,&#13;
including those activities that are part o f this proposal, fall within different parts o f the&#13;
MOPH. The proposed activities must .occur in a precise time frame and sequence (e.g.&#13;
guidelines must be developed before training can be initiated).             A Public Health&#13;
Coordinator will be appointed to the project coordinating unit, to be responsible for&#13;
implementingthis component. The PH Coordinator will also serve as the MOPH liaison&#13;
to the National Avian Influenza Secretanat (NAIS), and will coordinate the NGOs,&#13;
international organizations, and technical consultants who will be executing a number o f&#13;
theproject tasks through contractual arrangements with the MOPH.&#13;
&#13;
Development of command and control structures within the Ministry of Public&#13;
Health,and review of institutionalinfrastructure. The current ability o fthe MOPH to&#13;
manage complex emergencies, such as disease outbreaks, i s limited and fragmented.&#13;
There is no management structure for handling a complex problem like avian influenza.&#13;
An outbreak of AI will require a system for integrating surveillance information,&#13;
communications, deployng response teams, pharmaceuticals management, specimen and&#13;
test result tracking. It will also need to liaise with provincial and local health authonties&#13;
and other parts o f govemment. Project funding will assess the institutional arrangements&#13;
within the MOPH for command and control, and develop a unified structure, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
staffing and equipment, to support the formation o f a command and control w t . Project&#13;
hnding will also provide for the appointment o f a director and operating costs for the&#13;
command andcontrol unit.&#13;
&#13;
Developmentof protocolsand guidelinesfor disease surveillance,response, and case&#13;
management. The MOPH has developed limited guidelines for disease surveillance,&#13;
including dissemination o f a case definition. Guidelines andprotocols are available from&#13;
many international orgamzations (WHO, CDC, the European CDC, other countnes that&#13;
have expenenced human illness from avian influenza). However, these guidelines will&#13;
need to be adapted to the situation inAfghanistan. Given the multiplicity o f organizations&#13;
that are providing health care in the country, uniform standards for disease surveillance,&#13;
reporting, investigation, and case management, are cntically needed. Training activities&#13;
cannot commence untilsuch matenals are inplace. Project financing will provide for the&#13;
technical assistance needed to: (i)rapidly develop, produce, and disseminate such&#13;
protocols and guidelines; and (ii)    carry out penodic reviews o f existing protocols and&#13;
guidelines and necessary modifications as the human dimensions o f avian influenza&#13;
evolve.&#13;
&#13;
Training workshops and activities. A comprehensive training program is needed to&#13;
assure uniform implementation o f protocols and guidelines for surveillance, response,&#13;
and case management of persons with avian influenza. The project will support a train-&#13;
the-trainer approach. Workshops will be conducted for up to three trainers from each of&#13;
the provinces on disease surveillance, training o f response teams, and case management.&#13;
The project will also support subsequent provincial and local training activities to be&#13;
conducted by the trainers.      The project will also provide resources for training o f&#13;
personnel at the national and regional referral hospitals being established as part of the&#13;
project. The project will provide resources for penodic refresher courses, especially as&#13;
the national situation, and the state of knowledge of avian influenza, evolves.       Such&#13;
penodic retraining will assure that the health care system is well-prepared to handle&#13;
humandiseaserelated to avian influenza.&#13;
&#13;
Conduct of tabletop and field simulations. Once protocols and guidelines are inplace,&#13;
it is important to conduct exercises to assurethat policy-makers and healthcare managers&#13;
understand how to respond to avian influenza and can identify and correct any gaps or&#13;
deficiencies in the system.       The project will support technical assistance for the&#13;
development o f two tabletop exercises and four field exercises, and will support the&#13;
actual conduct o f the exercises.&#13;
&#13;
B.2. Strengtheningthe NationalPublicHealth SurveillanceSystem&#13;
&#13;
Develop institutional capacity for avian influenza surveillance including data&#13;
collection, analysis, and dissemination in the MOPH. The project will support the&#13;
development o f a unit within the Ministry o f Public Health to coordinate surveillance&#13;
activities related to avian influenza and other pnonty diseases. At present, surveillance&#13;
activities within the MOPHare fragmented, and there i s no single unit with responsibility&#13;
for its collection, analysis, and dissemination. For avian and pandemic influenza, this i s a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
cntical deficiency It is likewise a problem for other pnonty conditions and diseases.#&#13;
The project will support the institutionalization o f a network for the avian influenza&#13;
component through the Disease Early Warning System (DEWS) currently under&#13;
development, including collection o f data on viral pneumonia and influenza-like illness&#13;
(ILI), from the local to the provincial to the national level. As regional facilities are&#13;
being developed as case referral centers (see below), the project will support sentinel site&#13;
ILI monitonng in these same locations.        The project will also support six additional&#13;
geographically representative sentinel sites for ILImonitonng. Each o f the eight sentinel&#13;
sites will be gven a lump sum payment o f $12,000 annually to cover equipment,&#13;
recording, reporting, specimen collection and shipment costs, and an information&#13;
coordinator at each surveillance site. Under this component, the project will support&#13;
equipment (computers,       communications equipment, training) and transportation,&#13;
information dissemination through monthly bulletins, a surveillance unit director and data&#13;
manager, and information collection personnel at each surveillance site. Because other&#13;
donor resources are available to support the surveillance unit director and data manager&#13;
for the first two years of the project, project funds are allocated for them dunng the third&#13;
year o f the project only.&#13;
&#13;
Support to rapid response teams. Each province in Afghanistan has rapid response&#13;
teams (also known as emergency response teams) that have been developed to conduct&#13;
investigations and institute control measures in emergency or outbreak situations, or&#13;
when unusual illness i s recognized. Each o f these teams i s multi-person. There are also&#13;
national level teams which provide back-up support to the provincial teams.             The&#13;
technical skill o f these response teams is inconsistent, as is their training. These teams&#13;
will need to respond if suspected or confirmed cases o f avian influenza are recognized.&#13;
They will need to conduct field investigations, complete report forms and file outbreak&#13;
investigation reports, initiate control measures, and collect appropnate specimens for&#13;
diagnostic purposes. The project will offer support to these teams, including training,&#13;
communications, transportation, personal protective equipment, and incentives. For the&#13;
purposes o f cost estimation, it was assumed that the surveillance infrastructure would&#13;
identify 50 potential cases or clusters requinng investigation per year, and that backup&#13;
support will be required from national level teams ten times per year. Support is also&#13;
provided for WHO to,provide technical support to the investigations being conducted by&#13;
the rapid response teams. Because funds from other sources are available to support&#13;
investigations dunng the first year o f the project, project funds are provided only for the&#13;
second and third year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Equip major medical referral centers. The project supports the development o f a&#13;
definitive diagnostic capacity using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for&#13;
avian influenza in the Ministry o f Public Health Central Laboratory         This capacity is&#13;
beingdeveloped by other donors, and is therefore not covered under the project proposal.&#13;
For case management purposes, four regional medical centers have been identified as&#13;
referral facilities for suspected and confirmed avian influenza (see below). Two&#13;
additional referral centers are being refurbished and operated by other sources. These&#13;
facilities have weak laboratory diagnostic capacity Although the project cannot support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development o f RT-PCR in each o f these sites, it is appropnate for case-management&#13;
purposes (e.g. to aid decision making on initiation of anti-viral therapy, health care&#13;
worker prophylaxis, use o f isolation) to have access to rapid diagnostic luts to identifythe&#13;
presence o f influenza virus (luts identify influenza A &amp; B only). These pre-packaged kits&#13;
are feasible for resource-limited laboratones. Because two o f the four designated referral&#13;
centers are inKabul, it is not necessary to provide kits to these hospitals, since specimens&#13;
can be rapidly transferred to the Central Laboratory for definitive RT-PCR diagnosis.&#13;
Kits, along with the training to use them, will be provided to the remaimng two facilities&#13;
and the two facilities being established through other donors, outside of Kabul.&#13;
Sufficient capacity to perform 100 rapid tests per year will be provided to each o f these&#13;
four referral sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.3. Strengtheningthe HealthCare SystemResponseCapacity&#13;
&#13;
Designation of regional health care facilities and upgrading of these facilities to&#13;
serve as referral institutions for persons with suspected or confirmed avian&#13;
influenza. Although it is not possible to predict where human cases might appear in&#13;
Afghanistan, dung the pre-pandemic phases there will need to be specialized referral&#13;
facilities to isolate and care for persons with suspected or confirmed disease. Dunngthe&#13;
pandemic phase, when there are likely to be large numbers o f illindividuals, the health&#13;
care system will have difficulty canng for all .severely illpatients. However, there will&#13;
still be a role for these isolation facilities. At present, Afghan health facilities are ill-&#13;
prepared to care for such patients, lacking the physical infrastructure, equipment (e.g.&#13;
oxygen generators, suction devices), and supplies for such isolation wards. The project&#13;
will support facility renovations to hospitals designated by the national government to&#13;
serve as referral facilities on a regional basis. This includes two hospitals inKabul (the&#13;
infectious disease hospital and the Indira Ghandi pediatnc hospital) and two in other&#13;
locations in the country yet to be designated.     Two additional sites are being developed&#13;
by other donor sources. The project will also support transportation costs to transfer&#13;
patients from penpheral locations to these referral facilities. Because most health care&#13;
services in Afghanistan are organized by the MOPH but managed through a consortium&#13;
o f NGOs, the project will support a contract with an NGO to renovate and operate the&#13;
wards designated for care o f persons with suspected or confirmed avian influenza&#13;
(isolation wards) in the four designated regional referral facilities. It i s expected that&#13;
these wards will be used to care for patients with other pnonty communicable diseases&#13;
(especially those where isolation may be necessary) when they are not being used for&#13;
patients with avian influenza.&#13;
&#13;
Personal protective equipment (PPE). Health care workers who will be canng for&#13;
persons with suspected or confirmed avian influenza should utilize protective equipment&#13;
to reduce their nsk o f exposure and infection. Standards for PPE have been established&#13;
by WHO. They include masks (N95 or above), gowns, gloves, boots, and for care o f&#13;
severely illpatients (e.g. in isolation facilities) goggles.   Since these patients may be&#13;
hospitalized in virtually any health care facility, or be seen in comprehensive or basic&#13;
health care centers, some amount o f PPE should be available in these settings.            A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
standardized set o f PPE, if purchased in bulk, should cost about $15 U.S. per unit. The&#13;
project will obtain 200 sets o f PPE per referral hospital, 100 sets per regional and&#13;
provincial hospital, and 25 sets per distnct hospital.        A backup stdckpile o f PPE&#13;
maintained by the MOPH will also be developed. The project will also budget for a 25&#13;
percent replacement rate per year. The project will also fund shipping and distribution&#13;
costs.&#13;
&#13;
Antiviral medications.      As currently circulating avian influenza (H5N1) viruses are&#13;
uniformly resistant to M 2 inhibitors (amantadine and nmantidine), the only currently&#13;
feasible antiviral option i s the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (for both prophylaxis&#13;
and treatment). The other neuraminidase inhibitor (zanamivir) is currently not widely&#13;
available.     The project will support prophylactic use o f oseltamivir in limited&#13;
circumstances as follows: (a) prophylaxis o f workers engaged in culling activities (b)&#13;
prophylaxis o f health care workers canng for patients with confirmed avian influenza (c)&#13;
dunng the pre-pandemic phase, household and other close contacts o f patients with&#13;
confirmed avian influenza. The project will also support use o f oseltamivir for treatment.&#13;
However, to be effective, the drug must be administered within48 hours o f illness onset.&#13;
Given the challenging geography o f Afghanistan, this means that the drug must be&#13;
distributed and warehoused throughout the country, particularly in the facilities&#13;
designated as referral centers.      The project will support 200 treatment courses o f&#13;
oseltamivir in each o f the four regional referral centers, 100 treatment courses in each&#13;
province, with a 50 percent annual replacement estimate. A backup stockpile o f 1000&#13;
treatment courses with annual replemshment will be maintained by the MOPH. A&#13;
proportion (75%) o f the medication will be obtained inthe adult tablet formulation while&#13;
the remaining 25% will be in the pediatnc formulation. The ration is reversed for the&#13;
pediatnc hospital inKabul. Ifadditional medicationi s needed, it can be accessedthrough&#13;
the stockpile o f WHO, or through emergency purchases o f medication. The dose and&#13;
duration o f prophylaxis is one tablet per day for 10 days.      The WHO recommended&#13;
treatment course i s one tablet twice daily for five days. The estimated cost o f oseltamivir&#13;
i s $2/tablet and $4/dose for the pediatnc formulation, although costs may be less from&#13;
other WHO-certified suppliers. The project will also support shipping and distribution&#13;
costs.&#13;
&#13;
Seasonal influenza vaccine for health care workers and poultry culling workers.&#13;
Persons at high nsk o f exposure to avian influenza virus should be vaccinated against&#13;
regular (or seasonal) influenza. This will reduce the opportunity for simultaneous co-&#13;
infection with humanand avian viruses, a circumstance which can promote re-assortment&#13;
and enhance person-to-person transmissibility        Since influenza viruses naturally dnft&#13;
from year-to-year, this vaccine must be given annually InAfghanistan, individuals who&#13;
should receive this vaccine are poultry culling workers, health care workers with a high&#13;
'likelihood o f canng for patients with avian influenza, and persons working in laboratones&#13;
where viable avian influenza virus may be present. The estimated cost of each vaccine&#13;
dose i s $10.00.     The project will cover costs for procurement, distribution, and&#13;
administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Developmentof case managementstrategies duringthe pandemicphase. Ithas been&#13;
estimated that with no interventions, at the peak o f an influenza pandemic 30-40 percent&#13;
o f the population o f a community may be illat the same time, with 10 percent o f these&#13;
individuals (3-4 percent o f the population) severely ill.Few communities inAfghmstan&#13;
have the infrastmcture to support such a large number o f illpersons at one time. There&#13;
are strategies that can reduce the amount o f overall illness, but even in the best of&#13;
circumstances, in a full-blown pandemic large numbers o f individuals will seek and&#13;
require care. It i s therefore important to plan for these needs and develop options to&#13;
handle these illnesses. InAfghmstan, given the geographic isolation o f many areas, it is&#13;
possible not all communities will be impactedby the pandemic. Furthermore, because o f&#13;
its geographic, it i s likely that all would not be affected at the same time. Planrung&#13;
efforts should take these factors into consideration. Given the low level o f surge capacity&#13;
o f the Afghan health care system, a case management approach which takes full&#13;
advantage o f the community health worker system and emphasizes home management,&#13;
should be emphasized. The project will support the development o frecommendations for&#13;
health care management dunngthe pandemic phase.&#13;
&#13;
Surge capacity in the health care system during a pandemic. Afghmstan has one o f&#13;
the lowest health care worker per capita ratios inthe world. Exacerbating this problem i s&#13;
that these workers are not evenly distributed throughout the country, being&#13;
disproportionately urban. Dunnga pandemic, health care workers will also be ill,leaving&#13;
some communities without health care services. Therefore it i s important to develop&#13;
strategies to deal with possible shortages o f health care workers dunng the pandemic&#13;
phase, and to develop strategies to reinforce the health care workforce.        Among the&#13;
possible strategies to be employed are shifting health care workers from less affected to&#13;
more affected communities, developing and credentialing a volunteer workforce, and&#13;
bnnging health care workers no longer actively engaged in health care back onto&#13;
temporary service (e.g. a reserve force). The project will support the development and&#13;
implementation o f recommendations for health care worker surge capacity dunng the&#13;
pandemic phase.&#13;
&#13;
Social distancing measures.         In the pre-pandemic and pandemic phases, social&#13;
distancing measures can play an important role in limiting the spread of disease and&#13;
reducing overall morbidity and mortality. Community isolation and quarantine, closure&#13;
o f common gathenng places (e.g. schools, sports venues, and religious institutions),&#13;
business closures or worker furloughs, and travel advisones/alerts or restnctions, are&#13;
among the more common social distancing measures. Social distancing plans need to be&#13;
developed before they are actually needed. Because implementation and enforcement o f&#13;
many o f these measures fall outside the responsibility o f the MOPH, it will be necessary&#13;
to draw a number o f other stakeholders into the discussion and plandevelopment. These&#13;
stakeholders include, but are not limited to, local community leaders, religious leaders,&#13;
Ministnes of Education, Sports, Transportation, Secunty, and Defense, and the business&#13;
community The project will support the development o f a social distancing plan. Once&#13;
this plan is developed, consideration should be given to devoting one o f the tabletop or&#13;
field exercises to implementationo f social distancing measures.&#13;

C. COMMUNICATIONAND PUBLIC AWARENESS&#13;
&#13;
The AHIP fdly recognizes the importance o f a communications component inits quest to&#13;
control and contain AI and reduce its nsks both to humans and animals. This component&#13;
will inparticular address the following activities: a) elevate public awareness, control the&#13;
spread in the poultry sector, and prevent the spread o f infection among humans; b) give&#13;
visibility to the multisectoral response; c) secure hgh-level political support; d) promote&#13;
a pro-active commuruty-dnven response; e) install a feedback and reporting mechanism,&#13;
to foster two-way information flows.&#13;
&#13;
UNICEF has had significant expenence incommunication and has recently designed and&#13;
implemented AI-related communication strategies in a number o f countnes in Asia and&#13;
elsewhere. The AI Secretanat incollaboration with other technical agencies (FAO, WHO&#13;
and NGOs) will seek the assistance o f UNICEF to prepare a communication strategy and&#13;
plano f action for AHIP Subject to agreement o f the AI Secretanat and NAIS, UNICEF&#13;
will also be responsible for implementing the strategy. If agreed with the National AI&#13;
Secretanat UNICEF will implement all or parts o f the communications component under&#13;
a contract with the former. The communications strategy and plan o f action, which will&#13;
be prepared by UNICEF will include the following activities if deemed appropnate at the&#13;
time o fimplementation.&#13;
&#13;
C.l. ExtensiveCommunication&#13;
&#13;
Training component to pnontv stakeholders: The National AI Secretanat will sub-&#13;
contract and manage the design, production and delivery o f face-to-face training to a&#13;
competent agency (an option could be UNICEF) to reduce the nsk o f infection in&#13;
animals, and prevent the spread o f the disease. Contents for these interventions will&#13;
adhere to FAO's guidelines on AI communications, and FAO-WHO-UNICEF's "pnonty&#13;
behaviors to control AI.". Support will be provided to finance the development o f&#13;
appropnate communication training matenal and training to homogenous groups o f&#13;
pnonty audience. Pnonty audiences groups are:&#13;
        Agncultural extension and public health staff,&#13;
&#13;
    0   Religious leaders&#13;
    0   Provincial Councils&#13;
    0   Community development councils&#13;
        Teachers/NGOs&#13;
&#13;
Training to media managers: The National AI Secretanat will sub-contract and manage a&#13;
program for the delivery of an information workshop on the AI epidemic. This will&#13;
include the creation and maintenance o f a cleannghouse o f information and&#13;
documentation on AI matenals, accessible to media reporters, for a professional and up-&#13;
to-date reporting o f the epidemic.&#13;
&#13;
Community-based mobilization and media suuport: The Communications Unit o f the&#13;
National Solidanty Program (NSP) will enter into partnership with the National AI&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             40&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Secretanat to reach the Commuruty Development Councils and rural populations across&#13;
 the country through its established communications infrastructure. The partnershp with&#13;
 NSP will also include assistance in the creation o f a feedback mechmsm, to bnng&#13;
 information from the grass-roots level, to the APSecretanat and other stakeholders. Ths&#13;
 mechanism can be built on NSP's existing community reporting system.&#13;
&#13;
 Support to face-to-face education and the development o f audiovisual matenals, for hgh-&#13;
 nsk and vulnerable rural population. T h s matenal will focus on five core messages:&#13;
 prevention and control o f AI; protection o f rural livelihoods; disclosure o f compensation&#13;
 mechanisms; rapid-reporting; andthe mobilization o f group resources.&#13;
&#13;
 The Component will finance the production costs o f five radio core messages. The spots&#13;
 will beproducedinlocal languages.&#13;
&#13;
 The Component will cover the production costs o f a weekly radio program, to highlight&#13;
 the activities undertaken, and investments made by pnonty mimstnes, to prevent and&#13;
 control AI.&#13;
&#13;
 A request to the NSP will be made to contribute in-kindto the AI project inthe delivery&#13;
 o f "community-based dialogues," the five radio core messages, and the weekly&#13;
 presentation o f AI government activities. Similarly, the NSP will negotiate with&#13;
 subcontracted networks: RTA, Inter-News and Equal Access, for the dissemination of the&#13;
 radio messages inan intensiveradio campaign.&#13;
&#13;
 Radio senals for sustainable awareness: The Afghan Education PrograrrBBC, will be&#13;
 subcontracted to produce a package o f edutainment senals, covenng all audiences in the&#13;
 rural population, across the country&#13;
&#13;
 The senals will focus on the AI prevention and control messages inthe first three months&#13;
 o f the project, while maintaining a presence o f the educational contents across the rest o f&#13;
 the first year. The package will include research, message design, production in two&#13;
 languages, broadcasting, as well as monitonng and evaluation o f the effects, in four&#13;
 established radio dramas, namely. Health life, People talk, Senes for Afghan children,&#13;
 and Village voice&#13;
&#13;
 Advocacy to secure high-levelpolitical suuuort: The Component will organize a senes o f&#13;
 presentations to the NAIS members, the parliament and other decision-makers, about&#13;
 possible epidemic scenarios; financial and social costs; and the activities o f the national&#13;
 response program. Identification and training o f spokespersons will be provided, as well&#13;
'as a consistent plan to inform the media on a regular basis. Lastly an operational budget&#13;
 for communications, assigned to the National AI Secretanat, will be earmarked for&#13;
 emergingcommunication needs inthe first year o fthe project. A budget to maintain basic&#13;
 communications operations dunng years 2 and 3 will be available, with the assumption&#13;
 that other national government programs will assist and finance operations, in case of&#13;
 need. The main activities include:&#13;
      a) Meetings and presentations to decision-makers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    b) Selectionandtraining o f spokespersons&#13;
    c) Press conferences and roundtables&#13;
    d) Communications budget for emerging needs&#13;
&#13;
C.2. IntensiveCommunication&#13;
&#13;
Gender sensitive communicators inthe mobile response units: Under this Sub-component&#13;
the Project will subcontract the professional training o f women, to act as Communication&#13;
Officers in the mobile units responding to the outbreaks. They will receive specialized&#13;
training in the preventive health aspects o f AI, preparedness plans, socio-psychological&#13;
and community-based mobilization. These Communications Officers will be equipped&#13;
with educational matenals and resources to face the immediate needs o f impacted&#13;
populations, and will be hiredfor the duration o f the project (3 years).&#13;
&#13;
The mobile teams will receive intensive training with regard to the AI (both from the&#13;
animal and human health perspectives), issues o f control, safeguards, containment and its&#13;
dangers. The main task o f these teams are to raise awareness with regard to the AI and&#13;
persuade women within the households to allow necessary culling and what precautions&#13;
to take ifcertain symptoms are observed.&#13;
&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL COORDINATIONAND PROJECTMANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
Financing for this Component will cover overall institutional coordination and project&#13;
management. It will cover (i)    NAIS expenses for its operations and to strengthen the&#13;
National Policy and regulatory environment and (ii)the cost o f the Implementation&#13;
Support Team operations to implement the proposed Project, including financial&#13;
management, procvrement, monitonng and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
D.l. Strengtheningthe NationalPolicyand RegulatoryEnvironment. Although there&#13;
are regulations and guidelines in place, compliance and enforcement are not actively&#13;
practiced. Present lack o f cooperation and exchange o f information between ministnes i s&#13;
also not conducive to an effective response to the containment, control and eradication o f&#13;
HPAIinAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
The project will support therefore activities for improving the policy, legal and regulatory&#13;
framework relating to AI. This will extend to ensunng inter-ministenal coordination and&#13;
cooperation and the national capability to implementthe recommendeddisease detection,&#13;
control, prevention, containment and eradication measures ina uniform and effective way&#13;
and in accordance with OIE standards and guidelines. The Component includes support&#13;
for a detailed review of current policies and the existinglegal and regulatory environment&#13;
and for drafting, as may be warranted, o f legal amendments, regulations, and&#13;
implementation guidelines and manuals. Further the project will fund related policy&#13;
studies and dissemination workshops especially those focusing on trans-boundary animal&#13;
diseases.&#13;
&#13;
National Action Plan. The Director DVS has few qualified and trained staff to delegate&#13;
responsibility for implementation o f an action plan. Following the first outbreak o f HPAI,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             42&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   a National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan&#13;
   (ANIPPRP) was developed in close collaboration with the MOPH, NEPA, FAO,&#13;
   USDNAPHISNSandWHO. This forms thebasis o fthe Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
,  As part o fthe NAIPPRP, a good and comprehensive draft actionplan" hasbeenprepared&#13;
   for the vetennary sub-sector. The Plan includes precise details (standard operating plans)&#13;
   for: (i) detection o f suspected cases of HPAI in domestic poultry, and (ii)rapid&#13;
             rapid&#13;
   eradication o f HPAI by stamping out. It further spells out the responsibilities o f the&#13;
   response plan task force, and regional and local .task forces, and the cntical need for&#13;
   operational team training.        It also specifies a communication plan. The project will&#13;
   provide support to further refimng the NAIPPRP and to develop the necessary detailed&#13;
   implementation guidelines and manuals outlining the steps to be taken at all levels for all&#13;
   relevant agencies and services. Specialists will be contracted to assist in this work in&#13;
   close collaboration with the national HPAI working group and the agencies involved&#13;
   (MAI, FA0 and subcontracted NGOs, notably AVA) inHPAI prevention and control of&#13;
   animal health.&#13;
&#13;
   Development of a HPAI Contingency Plan. Initial response efforts by the MAIto the&#13;
   diagnosis o f avian influenzawere delayed for three weeks because o f&#13;
&#13;
            lack o fpersonal protective equipment PPE),&#13;
            lack o f equipment and supplies to conduct culling, disposal and decontamination&#13;
            o f premisesknownto holdinfectedpoultry,&#13;
       0    lack o f training for personnel to conduct surveillance, euthanasia, and disposal of&#13;
            culled birds,&#13;
       0    inadequate transportation and communication to support deployedteams, and&#13;
       0    lack o f immediate financial support from GOA and donor community to support&#13;
            teams deployed to provinces.&#13;
&#13;
   The Contingency Plan to be developed under the Project will include guidelines for the&#13;
  rapid mobilization o f physical and human resources to respond quickly to an outbreak.&#13;
   This will require close cooperation between the relevant ministnes and the immediate&#13;
   availability o f contingency funds. Project support will provide for developing a&#13;
   contingency plan with detailed procedures for supporting early reaction capabilities o f all&#13;
  parties concerned in case o f a H P A I outbreak. Useful information can be found in a&#13;
   number o f FAO/OIE documents12 and in the Australian Vetennary Emergency Plan&#13;

Inparticularproject actions will focus on: (i) training staff and testing plans, developing&#13;
capabilities at the national, provincial and distnct vetennary centers, field level and&#13;
laboratory services; (ii)&#13;
                        developing mechanisms for ensunng close collaboration between&#13;
government and pnvate sector services and farming cornmumties in the emergency&#13;
response; (iii)developing the capacity to mobilize resources to counter the disease or any&#13;
other m m a l health emergency in the most efficient way (including equipment,&#13;
vaccination, personnel and finances); and (iv) establishing legal and administrative&#13;
structures to deal with an emergency. The project will support contingency allowances&#13;
for appropnate humanresources as required.&#13;
&#13;
Regulation o f the Poultry Sector. The project will support the assessment of present&#13;
policies regulating the Afghan poultry sector. When warranted appropnate policies and&#13;
regulations to strengthen the poultry sector would be drafted.&#13;
&#13;
D.2. ProjectCoordination&#13;
&#13;
Financing for this sub-component will cover overall project management, including&#13;
technical coordination, financial management, procurement, monitonng and evaluation&#13;
and ad hoc consultancies. Institutional capacity will be strengthened for coordinating and&#13;
managing the project, at central and provincial levels (national and zonal coordination&#13;
units). Inaddition to full time employment o f personnel at central and provincial levels,&#13;
project actions will promote linkages with existing coordination structures. Linkages will&#13;
be specifically made with Bank-financed operations in the agnculture/livestock/health&#13;
sectors to make synergies with project management, coordination, procurement and&#13;
monitonng and evaluation.&#13;

I.Background&#13;
&#13;
The AI outbreaks were first identified in six South-East Asian countnes inclose succession.&#13;
The HPAIhas since spread to more than 35 countnes, which has infected 194 people out o f&#13;
which 109 cases have been fatal (as o f 12 April 2006). Inaddition it has caused the death o f&#13;
200 million birds (as of February 2006) since the outbreak. The spread o f AI in quick&#13;
succession has raised significant concern over the potential emergence o f a pandemic with&#13;
devastating consequences for humanhealth and livelihoods.&#13;
&#13;
A study by the European Commission indicates that the global losses from the HPAI&#13;
outbreak since late 2003 may run into billions o f U S dollars. Direct economic costs are the&#13;
costs associated with the loss o f poultry population, poultry products, control, mitigation and&#13;
treatment o f patients as well as the loss o f life. Indirect costs are the effects on higher&#13;
alternative substitute food products, the loss o f capital employed in the poultry sector, from&#13;
the fam-gate to the fork, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
In Afghanistan, nearly 98 percent of the poultry sector is owned and managed by poor&#13;
households under free-range, scavenging with insignificant or no purchased feeding provided&#13;
and very small numbers kept around the house. The poultry is not only a good source of&#13;
nutntion for poor households but also a significant source o f income as well as a store of&#13;
value, hence, an important factor in household food secunty Lack o f sufficient alternative&#13;
sources of income and nutntion would augment the direct costs AI to households and&#13;
increase household vulnerability to food insecurity The resilience o f the poultry sector in&#13;
other countnes following the HPAI outbreaks have been noted, however, this may prove&#13;
rather difficult inAfghanistan for lack o f investible fund at the household levels, inparticular&#13;
the resource-poor rural households.&#13;
&#13;
11. Methodologyand Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
The economic analysis for this project uses the standard with andwithout-project cost-benefit&#13;
analysis using accepted scenanos and standards. The without-project scenano assumes that&#13;
nothing will be done and the toll on poultry and humans will be unhindered. The WHO&#13;
estimated parameters in conjunctions with local data are used to estimate the impact o f an&#13;
unhindered AI outbreak. The with-project scenano estimates the costs with the proposed&#13;
project, investment costs and the losses to humans and poultry, as the mission i s under no&#13;
illusion to assume that the proposed interventions will be 100 percent effective, given the&#13;
animal and human health conditions and institutional capacities in the country Finally, the&#13;
net benefit i s denvedby usingdifference between the total costs o fwith and without project.&#13;
&#13;
Cntical assumptions for estimating costs and benefits are based on likely guesses on&#13;
probabilities o f events that are not estimated using scientific methods, simply because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              48&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
statistics on the AI or similar diseases do not exist. Therefore, caution is necessary when&#13;
interpretingthe resulting project IRR andNPV.&#13;
&#13;
Population: The last census was conducted in 1979 and no accurate census has since been&#13;
conducted. Therefore,         population estimates by vmous national and international&#13;
organizations vary greatly and range between 22 and 26 million. However, the Central&#13;
Statistics Office (CSO) in2003 undertook a review and made some estimates for settled and&#13;
nomad population. The CSO hasjust published population estimates for 2006 at 23.6 million&#13;
with settled population estimated at 22.1 million and the nomads (Kuchi) population&#13;
estimated at 1.5 million. The current population estimates are based on the 2003 estimates&#13;
and review, which may have some credibility issues but is still the best estimate available.&#13;
Population growth is estimated at 1.9 percent per year. Since the last official census in 1979,&#13;
population has almost doubled (the fertility rate at 6.8 percent i s one o f the highest in the&#13;
world). Urban population is currently estimated at just over 21 percent o f the total, with&#13;
urbanization nsing at an alarming rate.&#13;

    a. in the event o f an outbreak 30 percent o f the poultry sector will be affected, and'any&#13;

        annum;&#13;

    f. Local pnces (with appropnate adjustments) are used in calculating the appropnate&#13;
        unit costs;&#13;
    g. The unit cost estimates and the vanous assumptions are presented inTables 1and 2.&#13;
&#13;
With-Project Scenario. Assumes that the proposed project actions will have a gradual but&#13;
notable effect on the containment, protection and treatment o f a likely AI outbreak. The&#13;
following main assumptions are made:&#13;
&#13;
    a. Probability o f success inthe prevention o f an AI outbreak inpoultry is conservatively&#13;
        assumed at 20 percent reaching 50 percent inthe fourth year o f the project;&#13;
    b. Probability o f success in rotecting humans is assume at 10 percent gradually&#13;
        reaching40 percent inthe 7tRproject year;&#13;
    c. Probability o f success in containment o f AI and treatment o f infected humans i s&#13;
        assumed at 20 percent reaching 40 percent inthe 4thproject year, both assumptions, c&#13;
        and d are highly conservative in view o f the dilapidated and low capacity o f the&#13;
        publichealth sector inAfghanistan;&#13;
    d. It is further assumed that the government expenditure in economic terms to continue&#13;
        the project containment and control plansbeyond the life o fthe project will amount to&#13;
        about US$2.1 million over the penod o f analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Some notable and highlyrelevant direct and indirect costs related to the AI outbreak have not&#13;
been included in the analysis, in view o f the uncertainties in extent o f correlation, lack o f&#13;
appropnate data and information. Many traders and the nascent poultry farms have incurred&#13;
significant costs and many have beenheavily indebted. Inaddition, many traders and poultry&#13;
farmers are awaiting news and instructions from relevant authonties, when to begin their&#13;
activities and inwhat form. This situation i s further detenorating their financial situation.&#13;

The Results&#13;
&#13;
Table 2 provides the results o f the project economic analysis using a number of&#13;
conservative assumptions and parameters. The basic assumptions are relatively more&#13;
conservative even,when compared with the assumptions made for similar projects in&#13;
other countnes in the region and elsewhere. Despite such conservative assumptions, the&#13;
project economic analysis results inanNPV ofUS$21million and an IRR o f 37 percent,&#13;
whlch are highly significant and suggests that the proposed project is economically and&#13;
financially viable.&#13;

SensitivityAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
Table 3 provides a summary o f sensitivity analysis based on a number of assumptions as&#13;
presented in the table below. Despite significant changes in the rates o f project success,&#13;
probability o f AI outbreaks and the associated costs both to humans and animals, the&#13;
project IRR and NPV i s still highly significant. Therefore, the project is robust and the&#13;
results do not change even if the assumptions change significantly. Changing the&#13;
parameters in the human health impact o f the project significantly changes the IRR and&#13;
NPV&#13;

DistributionalAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
Poultry i s one o f the most important sources o f food and income as well as a reliable&#13;
store o f value and a cushion for consumption smoothing in lean seasons. The poultry&#13;
sector i s predominantly a backyard and household activity with 98 percent o f the poultry&#13;
owned by households under very small scale management (about 4 birdshousehold on&#13;
average) with very little or no purchased inputs. The householdpoultry i s entirely owned&#13;
and managed by women. Usually the income from poultry finds its way directly to the&#13;
purse rather than the wallet, with notable impact on the intra-household consumption&#13;
behavior and welfare. Any support to the household poultry sector positively contributes&#13;
to correcting the gender bias inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Almost all of the rural poor raise some poultry in their backyard, which contributes to&#13;
their diet and is animportant source of income. Alternative sources o f income are, by and&#13;
large, limited and any loss o f income from the poultry sector will have significant food&#13;
insecunty repercussions. Poultry i s also one o f the most significant sources o f income for&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
CountryContext&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has gained substantial expenence and understanding o f the procurement&#13;
environment in Afghanistan through its involvement in the intenm procurement&#13;
arrangements put in place through EPAP as well as with the institutions with current&#13;
responsibility for those and the subsequent arrangements, namely ARDS. As part o f the&#13;
broader review o f Afghanistan's Public Finance Management (PFM) system, the Bank&#13;
camed out an assessment o f the procurement environment in the country based on the&#13;
baseline and performance indicators developed by a group o f institutions led by the&#13;
World Bank and OECDDAC.&#13;
&#13;
The first key issue identified through the procurement assessment was the need for&#13;
ownership and a champion in the Government for reform, deepening o f capacity,&#13;
ensmng integnty in the operation o f procurement systems, and promoting sound&#13;
procurement among ministnes.&#13;
&#13;
A new Procurement Law has been adopted in November 2005 which radically&#13;
transforms the legal and regulatory framework. While it provides a very modern legal&#13;
system for procurement, it may be difficult to implement in the current context. The&#13;
Procurement Policy Unit (PPU) has now been established under the M O F to ensure&#13;
implementation through the creation of secondary legislation, standard bidding&#13;
documents, provision o f advice and creation o f the necessary information systems for&#13;
advertising and data collection. It further relies on the development o f an independent&#13;
complaints review mecharusm to ensure enforcement. These institutional arrangements&#13;
are yet to be inplace.&#13;
&#13;
Inthe absence of adequate capacity to manage procurement activities effectively, some&#13;
intenmarrangementshave beenput inplace to improve the procurementmanagement o f&#13;
the country    A central procurement facilitation service has been established under&#13;
A R D S which i s supervised by the Ministry o f Economy The Bank and the Government&#13;
has agreed on a program for country wide procurement reform and capacity building,&#13;
leading to the transition from centralized to decentralized procurement services. The&#13;
Bank funded Public Administration Capacity Building project (PACBP) i s the pnmary&#13;
instrument for implementingthe program to strengthen capacity o f the line ministnes to&#13;
manage public procurement in an effective, transparent and accountable manner.&#13;
However, the implementation o f the procurement capacity building strategy has not&#13;
made any significant progress yet due to lack o f coordination and delays in decision&#13;
making within the Government.       The envisaged radical changes to the procurement&#13;
management environment expected from the new Law also require the urgent&#13;
implementation o f a comprehensive human resources and capacity development&#13;
program. The implementation of the procurement reform component o f the PACBP&#13;
should be considered with due pnonty to ensure that fiduciary standards are further&#13;
enhanced and that capacity i s developed inthe Government to maintain these standards.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
January 2006 and it was found that the existing Ministry staff does not have adequate&#13;
expenence for handlingBank financed projects.&#13;
&#13;
To mitigate this nsk, the mimstry will be strengthened by a competent procurement&#13;
specialist to carry out procurement action under the project and train the ministry&#13;
procurement staff.&#13;
&#13;
The procurement specialist will be responsible for managing procurement for: (i)      the&#13;
animal health component based on technical specifications provided by the Department&#13;
o f Vetennary Services; and (ii)the communications component, based on t e c h c a l&#13;

Ministry o f Public Health. The Bank made an assessment o f the capacity o f the&#13;
procurement staff o f MOPHto implement part of the procurement actions for the project&#13;
in April 2006 and it was revealed that the existing personnel does not have adequate&#13;
expenence for managing Bank financed projects. To mitigate the nsk, the following&#13;
arrangement will be adopted for the Project:&#13;
&#13;
a) a competent procurement specialist will be hired under Grant and Contract&#13;
Management Unit (GCMU) o f MOPH to procure small value o f goods, works and&#13;
consultancy contracts;&#13;
&#13;
b) procurement o f highvalue and complex contracts for the first year o f the project will&#13;
be carned out through UN agencies which will be contracted as consultants under the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
Because o f the overall responsibility o f MA1 for implementing the Project, all&#13;
procurement for the public health component will be carned out incollaborationwith the&#13;
IST based in MAI. To ensure compliance with the World Bank policy and procedure,&#13;
procurement documentation for complex and large value o f goods, works and&#13;
consultancy contracts will be carned out with consultation o f the ARDS.&#13;

&#13;
The Bank has gained substantial expenence and understanding o f the financial management&#13;
environment inAfghmstan through the large number o f projects under implementation over the&#13;
past four years. The Public Administration Capacity Building Project (PACBP) i s the pnmary&#13;
instrument to continue and enhance the fiduciary measures put inplace dunng the past years to&#13;
help ensure transparency and accountability for the funding provided by the Bank and other&#13;
donors.&#13;
A PFM performance rating system using 28 high-level indicators that was developed by the&#13;
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) multi-agency partnershp program was&#13;
applied in Afghanistan in June 2005       PEFA   IS  compnsed o f the World Bank, IMF, EC, and&#13;
several other agencies.      The system is structured around six core dimensions o f PFM&#13;
performance: i)budget credibility, ii)comprehensiveness and transparency, iii)policy-based&#13;
budgeting, iv) predictability and control in budget execution, v) accounting, recording, and&#13;
reporting, and vi) external scrutiny and audit.           Afghanistan's ratings against the PFM&#13;
performance indicators generally portray a public sector where financial resources are, by and&#13;
large, being used for their intendedpurposes. Thshas been accomplished with very high levels&#13;
o f support from international firms; this assistance will continue to be needed over the medium&#13;
term ifthese ratings are to be maintained. There i s also muchroom for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
Inspite of undeniable gains made inreconstruction since the end o f 2001, the challenges facing&#13;
Afghanistan remain immense; not least because o f the tenuous secunty situation in the region&#13;
and continued prevalence o f a large illegal and illicit economy The policy framework&#13;
benchmarks have not yet been fully costed so vanous pnonties are funded through the annual&#13;
budgeting process. The nsing costs o f the secunty sector constitute the major constraint on&#13;
attainment o f fiscal sustainability With regardto executive oversight, the national assembly will&#13;
play an increasingly active role. All in all, the new national strategy has created high&#13;
expectations o f the executive which could prove to be quite difficult to meet.&#13;
&#13;
The public sector, in spite o f considerable efforts to reform its core functions, remains extremely&#13;
weak outside o f Kabul. The lack o f qualified staff in the civil service and the absence o f&#13;
qualified counterparts in the government after 30 years or war and conflicts is a binding&#13;
constraint. Delays in reforming the pay structure and grading o f civil servants have severely&#13;
crippled the public administration of the country Domestic revenues lag behindexpendituresby&#13;
a factor o f ten to one. Large-scale corruption could emerge to undermine the government's&#13;
efforts to enhance aid flows through national accounts. Capacities to track expenditures and&#13;
monitor expenditure outcomes have improved, but they need rapid and substantial strengthening&#13;
ifprogress toward the attainment ofnational development targets is to bemonitored. Currently,&#13;
75 percent o f external revenues bypass government appropnation systems.&#13;

The World Bank is financing a Financial Management Advisor to assist the Ministry o fFinance,&#13;
an Audit Advisor to assist the Control and Audit Office, and a Procurement Advisor to assist in&#13;
Procurement-related activities. Also an Internal Audit h c t i o n i s being developed within the&#13;
Ministry o f Finance with World Bank financing. USAID and earlier the Indian Aid Assistance&#13;
Program are also financing a team o f consultants and advisors to assist the D a AfghanistanBank&#13;
in local as well as foreign currency operations. The activities carned out under the existing&#13;
Public Administration projects have helped the Government to ensure that appropnate fiduciary&#13;
standards are maintained for public expenditures, including those supported by the Bank and the&#13;
donor community.&#13;
&#13;
Progress has been slower than expected in shiftingfrom operations support provided by the three&#13;
Advisors to capacity development and knowledge transfer to the civil servants. Given that, it i s&#13;
expected that the Advisors will continue to be required for the medium term. Challenges still&#13;
remain in attaining the agreed upon fiduciary standards and also to further enhance them. And to&#13;
make matters more complex, the regulatory environment in Afghanistan has advanced&#13;
significantly in the past three years. Unfortunately, even mastery o f basic skills in the early&#13;
environment does not fully qualify the civil servants to work effectively in the new emerging&#13;
environment.&#13;

Strengths andWeaknesses&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
The Government provides assurance to the Bank and other donors that the measures in place to&#13;
ensure appropnate utilization o f funds will not be circumvented. The Government support for&#13;
PACBP i s strength in itself to enhance financial management in Treasury operations, public&#13;
procurement, internal audit inthe public sector, and external audit by the Auditor General. This&#13;
will be the second IDA-funded grant for MAI, so the Ministry has expenence infollowing Bank&#13;
procedures.    Under the Horticulture and Livestock Project (HLP) MA1 has established an&#13;
Implementation Management Support Team (IMST) to oversee all aspects o f the project. The&#13;
IMST is part o f the General Department for Policy and Planning (GDPP) and includes a Lead&#13;
Facilitating Partner (LFP) involving technical and administrative specialists to train and&#13;
strengthen MA1 personnel in project implementation.             This team includes a financial&#13;
management specialist who will be responsible for developing sound financial management&#13;
procedures and training Afghan personnel responsible for financial management. In the same&#13;
way, this facility will be available to support the HAICP&#13;
&#13;
Weaknesses and Action Plan&#13;
&#13;
The main weakness in this project, as in many others in Afghanistan, is the ability to attract&#13;
suitably qualified and expenenced counterpart staff especially for Financial Management. The&#13;
additional staff to be fundedby the project, together with intensive training programs included in&#13;
this project, is expected to strengthen the fiduciary arrangements.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ImplementingEntity&#13;
&#13;
The National Emergency Response Committee through the AI National Committee (NAIC) will&#13;
serve as the oversight body. The NAIC, through the Finance Committee (FCAI) will convene at&#13;
least every four months to review progress with implementation and review and approve work&#13;
plans and budget. The Minister MAI, as Chairman o fNAIC, will have overall responsibility for&#13;
project implementation. The relevant technical departments o f MA1 and MOPH will be&#13;
responsible for implementing the &amp;mal        Health and HumanHealth components respectively.&#13;
Their activities will be managed by a Project Coordinator who will report to the Mimster of&#13;
Agnculture.&#13;
&#13;
In order to ensure comprehensive management o f NAIC finances, a Financial Management&#13;
Officer (FMO) i s being hired in MAI to perform key project functions and to help develop&#13;
capabilities of the MAIFinance and Administration Department (FAD). T h s responsibility will&#13;
also include training staff at the national and provincial levels. The FMO will work closely with&#13;
the financial management personnel responsible for financial management o f the Project and&#13;
HLP in IMST This staffing is considered adequate for the project since the bulk o f the project&#13;
work i s expected to be contracted out to other UNAgencies like WHO, UNICEF and FA0 who&#13;
will have their own FMarrangements.&#13;
&#13;
The FMO is expected to seek guidance and technical assistance from the Financial Management&#13;
Specialist o f the LFP o f HLP. The Financial Specialist IMST and his Afghan colleagues will&#13;
liaise with the Financial Management Officer (FMO) when prepanng M-16 forms (payment&#13;
orders). The Head o f the accounting department for Grant and Contracting Management Unit&#13;
(GCMU) in MOPH will take responsibility for the financial management activities o f the&#13;
component to be implemented by MOPH. This department is adequately staffed with FM&#13;
personnel who are efficiently managing all external grants includingIDA Health Sector Project.&#13;
The present capacity i s adequate to absorb FMwork related to AIC project.&#13;
&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
The budgets for respective components would be prepared in the responsible line ministry, i.e.&#13;
MA1 and MOPH and included in the development budget for the line ministry These will&#13;
however, be consolidated for the project at the AI Secretanat.&#13;
&#13;
Because limited capacity exists within MA1 to manage the external budget, the FMO with&#13;
support fi-om the Specialist under HLP will strengthen the financial management capacity of&#13;
MAI. The FMO will be responsible for ensunngthat projects expenditures expended ina fiscal&#13;
year are captured in the Governmental Development budget o f that fiscal year. The MA1must&#13;
get an approval from the presidential office and the parliament to be attached to B27 and PCS&#13;
forms at the time o f requesting yearly allotments for contracts under development project to&#13;
avoid delays when payments are processed.         Similarly G C M U will be responsible for this&#13;
function inMOPH.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
FundsFlow&#13;
&#13;
The standard mechanism o f flow o f funds inAfghanistanwill be followed inthis project. Project&#13;
funds will be deposited inthe Designated Account (DA) to be opened and maintained at the D a&#13;
Afghanistan Bank (DaB).       The DA, in keeping with current practices for other projects in&#13;
Afghanistan, will be operated by the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) in the Treasury&#13;
Department o f MoF Requests for payments out o f the DA will be made to the SDU by the&#13;
implementing entity when needed.&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition to payments out ofDA funds, the implementing entities could also request the SDU&#13;
to make direct payments from the Grant Account and Trust FundAccount to consultants, firms,&#13;
and contractors and special commitments for goods contracts covered by letters o f credit. These&#13;
payments will follow the World Bank procedures. All project payments are expected to bemade&#13;
to either international firms or local firms that have bank accounts in DaB, a local commercial&#13;
bank, or an overseas bank. All payments will be made either through bank transfers into the&#13;
account o f such firms or by check. All expenditures for each component will be paid centrally&#13;
from MA1and MOPH respectively in accordance with the approval mechanisms documented in&#13;
the FMManual.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
Retroactive financing o f up to US$l,OOO,OOO   IS envisaged for government financed expenditures&#13;
related to start-up activities between 15th June 2006 and when the grant i s signed. The&#13;
retroactive finance can be claimed only after the grant becomes effective and all disbursement&#13;
conditions have beenmet.&#13;

The SDU will maintain a proper accounting system o f all expenditures incurred along with all&#13;
the supporting documents to enable IDA to venfy these expenditures. The Financial&#13;
Management Officer and the government counterparts in MA1 and FM Staff o f GCMU in&#13;
MOPH will: i)supervise preparation of supporting documents for expenditures, ii)prepare&#13;
payment orders (Form M16), iii)obtain approval for M-16s by the Minister or Deputy Minister&#13;
dependingon the payment amount, and iv) submit them to the Treasury DepartmentinMoF for&#13;
venfication and payment. Whilst onginal copies o f required supporting documents are attached&#13;
to the Form M16, the project i s requiredto make and keep photocopies of these documents for&#13;

their record purposes. The FMAdvisor inthe MoF/SDU will use the government's computenzed&#13;
accounting system, AFMIS for reporting, generation o f relevant financial statements, and&#13;
exercising controls.&#13;
&#13;
Currently, all records o f payments by MA1 are filed manually However, the Financial&#13;
Management manualto be prepared for the project will establish a simple tracking and reporting&#13;
system in the General Department for Policy and Planning o f MAL The FMO and the&#13;
government counterpart will train existing MA1 staff to record project expenditures in&#13;
spreadsheets for maintenance o f accurate and timely financial data. The FM manual, to be&#13;
reviewed and approved by the Bank will include roles and responsibilities o f all FM staff,&#13;
documentation and approval procedures for finds transfers in each o f the subprograms, project&#13;
reporting requirements, and quality assurance measures to help ensure that adequate internal&#13;
controls and procedures are inplace and are being followed.&#13;
&#13;
The FM Manual will also establish project financial management in accordance with standard&#13;
Afghan government policies andprocedures, including use o fthe government Chart o fAccounts&#13;
to record project expenditures. The use o f these procedures will enable adequate recording and&#13;
reporting o f project expenditures. Overall project accounts will be maintained centrally in SDU,&#13;
which will be ultimately responsible for recording o f all expenditures and receipts in the&#13;
Government's accounting system. Reconciliation o f project expenditure records with M o F&#13;
records will be carned out by the General Department for Policy and Planning together with the&#13;

CompensationFund&#13;
&#13;
In order to ensure efficient and transparent management of the compensation fund, the&#13;
Compensation Procedures Manual will include details on the following: (i)the legal basis for&#13;
establishing responsibilities for Compensation Fund administration; (ii)     conducting a financial&#13;
needs assessment (how much will compensation cost); (iii)     identification of sources o f funds and&#13;
likely amounts from each source and mobilizing needed financing; (iv) identification o f the&#13;
payment agencies needed to get the funds to the beneficianes; (v) payments instruments to be&#13;
utilized (cash, bank transfers, vouchers, etc.; (vi) designing the basis on which payment will be&#13;
made i.e. certification; (vii) communication o f the time frame for payment; (viii) monitonng&#13;
disbursements; (ix) operation and financial audits; and (x) social accountability mechanisms.&#13;
Where UN agencies are involved, audit arrangements for the UN agencies will be described in&#13;
the Manual.&#13;
&#13;
There is also need for enhanced accountability measures to reduce the risk o f fraud and abuse.&#13;
Provision will be made in the Compensation Procedures Manual for continuous monitonng and&#13;
oversight through: (i)enhanced disclosure and transparency of project-related information -&#13;
after culling, a paying list o f farmers per village including the amounts to be compensated will&#13;
be announced in public space; (ii)establishment o f a mechanism to handle complaints about&#13;
misuse o f funds, especially for the Compensation Fund; and (iii) supplement the annual audit,&#13;
                                                                    to&#13;

FinancialReporting&#13;
&#13;
Financial Statements and Project Reports will be used for project monitonng and supervision.&#13;
Based upon the FM arrangements o f this project Financial Statements and Project Reports will&#13;
be prepared monthly, quarterly, and annually by the FMO (with assistance from GDPP local&#13;
counterpart staff) in the MA1and by the G C M U in the MOPH. These reports will be produced&#13;
based on records kept on Excel spread sheets after due reconciliation to expenditure statements&#13;
from SDU (as recordedinAFMIS) andbank statements from DAB.&#13;
&#13;
The quarterly Project Reports will show: (i) and uses o f funds by disbursement category&#13;
                                               sources&#13;

DisbursementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
Table 1 shows the allocation o f IDA proceeds and Table 2 the expected co-financing. A single&#13;
category for "goods, works, consultancy services, training, audit and operating costs" i s defined&#13;
in the financing agreement to facilitate preparation o f withdrawal applications and record-&#13;
keeping. Because there are specific disbursement conditions attached to the Compensation&#13;
Facility, there i s a separate disbursement category for this component. Project funds will be&#13;
disbursedover 36 months. The closing date o f the project will be March 31, 2010 with a final&#13;
disbursement deadline four months after the closing date.&#13;
&#13;
Dunng this additional 4-month grace penod, project-related expenditures incurred pnor to the&#13;
closing date are eligible for disbursement. Disbursements procedures set out in the Bank's&#13;
DisbursementGuidelines (May 2006) and "Disbursement Handbook for World Bank Clients              "&#13;
(May 2006) are applicable to this project.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                      Environmental assessment: Environmental Category B&#13;
&#13;
1. Environmental Aspects. The Project is assessedas a Category B Project. Activities under the&#13;
proposed Project are expected to generate no or limited adverse environmental effects, since&#13;
most activities o f the Project are considered to support preventive measures. The Project will,&#13;
generally, have positive environmental and social impacts as the project's investments in&#13;
facilities, equipment, laboratones, and training will improve the effectiveness and safety o f&#13;
existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures. This would be reinforced by the&#13;
mainstreamingo f environmental safeguards into the protocols andprocedures for the culling and&#13;
disposal o f animals dunng AI outbreaks, decontamination o f production facilities, and&#13;
laboratones. However, adverse environmental health impacts, mainly unintentional from the&#13;
spread o f HPAI, could occur when an emergency operation involves containment o f HPAI&#13;
outbreaks through quarantine, isolation and stamping out actions and when relevant mitigation&#13;
measures are not in place. Most o f the key potential impacts could be avoided or minimized by&#13;
integrating environmental and public health safety aspects in the preparatioddesign and&#13;
implementation o fthe project activities.&#13;
&#13;
2. Worker Safety       The suggested investments in health facilities, equipment, clothes, staff&#13;
training and management o f the waste will improve the safety and effectiveness o f Highly&#13;
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) handling and testing procedures. The PIM to be prepared&#13;
pnor to the disbursement should include these provisions.&#13;
&#13;
The project will help the Government of the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan in developing&#13;
strategies to manage future outbreaks o f infectious and zoonotic diseases that may emerge and&#13;
re-emerge. The Environmental and Social Safeguards will be benefited from this iri two major&#13;
ways: (i)  Environmental safeguards will be mainstreamed into protocols and procedures for the&#13;
inspection and disposal o f animals dunng an outbreak in due consideration o f OLE standards,&#13;
and (ii)Policies on compensation for poultry owners affected by future outbreaks will be&#13;
developed.&#13;
&#13;
Social Issues&#13;
&#13;
There are no Social Safeguards tnggered by the project, which will have significant positive&#13;
social impact by protection o f human lives through HPAI early warning,          prevention and&#13;
containment, improved poultry farming practices, increased public awareness o f HPAI and&#13;
improved hygiene and food preparation practices and waste management. Development o f&#13;
compensation policies to affected poultry owners will contribute to mitigate the effects of losses&#13;
suffered from HPAIpandemic.&#13;
&#13;
There will be no Land Acquisition (voluntary or involuntary) under the project, and carcasses o f&#13;
culled birds will only be deposited on public land. For backyard poultry operations, the local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
committee witnessingthe culling and the local vetennanan sign a document stating the carcass&#13;
deposit area for is public property and free o f encroachers/informal settlements. Incase o f semi-&#13;
commercial poultry farms, the zonal vetennanan and an official from the local administration&#13;
will sign a document stating that the carcass deposit area is public land and free of&#13;
encroachers/infonnal settlements.&#13;
&#13;
InAfghanistan, almost all poultry (98 percent) is raised infamily backyards rather than inlarge&#13;
commercial poultry farms. There are an estimated 250 small artisan incubators and only one&#13;
commercial hatchery that operate parttime". According to the NRVA, an average o f 86 percent&#13;
of rural households have poultry - at a rate o f 4 ammals per household (2003)16, w h c h is a&#13;
reduction o f almost 2/3 compared to the situation in 1995 (before the drought), where the&#13;
average number o f birds per household were 11.6. In all but two provinces, more than 75&#13;
percent o f rural households own poultry - the exceptions being Badghis (25 percent) and&#13;
Jawzjan (57 percent). Through the RAMP project, poultry production has been promoted in 25&#13;
distncts o f Ghazni, Kunduz, Nangarhar andParwanprovinces.&#13;
&#13;
The pnmary poultry production system i s the traditional backyard system where small numbers&#13;
o f domestic fowl are raised for home consumption with small, mostly seasonal surpluses being&#13;
soId in village markets. Women and children are the main tenders o f ammals in the rural&#13;
households, and unlike the larger livestock, poultry is normally considered the property of&#13;
women, who would normally control any income generated from the sale o f poultry and eggs.&#13;
Hence, village-based scavenger and semi-scavenger systems are owned and operated by women,&#13;
whereas semi-commercial poultry producers are exclusively men and are based in urban and&#13;
semi-urban areas.l7 With the preponderance o f village-based scavenger system, women and&#13;
children are thus highnsk groups inrespect o f H P A I and women andpoor households ingeneral&#13;
will in particular suffer economically from the HPAI, since poultry is one of the very few&#13;
income sources for women, and an important source o f supplementary foodincome particular in&#13;
poor households.&#13;
&#13;
While women are the main poultry owners, cultural restnctions on their mobility and social&#13;
interaction prevents them for being engaged inthe marketing o f poultry and eggs, which is thus&#13;
an entirely male domain. Live farm chickens and eggs either being sold at farm gate to collectors&#13;
or sold on the local markets directly to local consumers or to collectors. Young boys may retail&#13;
eggs produced by the family in rural penodic markets and pen-urban markets. The&#13;
collectors/middlemen will sometimes buy the chickens and eggs from the rural women through&#13;
barter, payng for the poultry and eggs in commercial goods particularly aimed at female&#13;
customers. Collectors transport the live chickens to urban centers for sale by retailers in the&#13;
urban live poultry markets, where different species of poultry (chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese,&#13;
guinea fowl) are kept in cages, which are not cleaned or disinfected regularly Evenvisibly sick&#13;
birds are attempted sold off before dyng, and in case o f culled birds, they are normally not&#13;

&#13;
People usually prefer buyng a live bird and kill it themselves at home as it i s considered&#13;
healthier than buyng a slaughtered bird, since the meat i s fresh and frozen chicken can spoil&#13;
before reaching the retailer due to the many interruptions inthe cold storage chain." Chicken i s&#13;
a very popular food in Afghanistan, often served to guests and invanably at special occasions&#13;
such weddings, engagements, funerals and religious festivals like Eid. While both poultry and&#13;
eggs normally are fully cooked when consumed, food handling practices in general are far from&#13;
safe. Eggs are usually consumed inthe momng, but boiled eggs are also sold as a snack in the&#13;
bazaar and at bus stations. Like in case o f chickens, there i s a strong preference for Afghan&#13;
produced brown eggs ("national eggs") which consumers consider healthier than white eggs&#13;
("machine eggs", imported from Pakistan or Iran), since they have a larger yolk. Brown eggs&#13;
sells for twice the pnce o f whte eggs, but cover only around 10percent o f the market (ibid).&#13;
&#13;
Special measures are required (a) to reach the pnmarily female poultry producers and assisting&#13;
children with sufficient information, training and mobilization to prevent the spread o f Avian&#13;
diseases. (b) to change household level behavior inpoultry raising, improved hygiene and food&#13;
preparation practices and waste management food through awareness raising and community&#13;
mobilization campaigns; (c) likewise, the identification o f the disease and the culling o f birds&#13;
have to involve significant community mobilization and awareness raising in view o f the&#13;
preponderance o f small domestic poultry units where cultural restnctions on the mobility and&#13;
social interaction o f women poultry owners render outreach activities, identification and culling&#13;
o f sick birds difficult and necessitates recruitment o f female field staff.&#13;

               birds, bird products or waste (eggs, manure and feathers) and equipment (for&#13;
               example inopen containers) may pose environmental andpublic healthnsks.&#13;
&#13;
      d)       Safe disposal o f carcasses. A practical and samtary system for disposing of dead&#13;
               birdswill help prevent the spread o fdisease andprotect air andwater quality&#13;
&#13;
Human Health Component: Refurbishing o f reference diagnostic laboratones (if any),&#13;
refurbishing o f referral hospitals and health clinics and training o f staff to include key&#13;
environmental issues related to zoonotic disease prevention and special waste management&#13;
(laboratones, clinics and hospitals).&#13;
&#13;
Public Awareness and Coordination Support Component: No environmental issues, but an&#13;
important component for design and delivery o f communications tools for good hygiene, safe&#13;
culling and disposal o f animal carcasses and animal waste management.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Support and Critical Imports (ifapplicable): No environmental issues.&#13;
&#13;
The pnmary potential key nsks can be grouped into two categones:&#13;
&#13;
  a)    Inadvertent human exposure and spread o f the virus due to: improper culling and&#13;
        disposal of dead birds (wild birds, sick and dead birds from backyard and commercial&#13;
        poultnes); lack of, or improper personal protection equipment (PPE); improper disposal&#13;
        of farm waste (Le. bedding, manure, washngs, etc. dunng andor after an outbreak); lab&#13;
        and hospital/medical, and&#13;
&#13;
  b)    Inadvertent release o f chemicals inthe environment from unsatisfactory decontamination&#13;
        procedures (for personnel, poultry sheds, andtransport vehicles, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for carcass, excreta and waste (eggs, manure and&#13;
feathers) disposal facilities is attached (Attachment 1to this appendix). However, it i s important&#13;
to note that the EMP will be further revised and updated with the evolving situation and&#13;
conditions inthe country with regardto AI. The necessary adjustments inthe scope of the EMP&#13;
will be specified dunngthe initial phases o fthe project implementation. While the EMPis being&#13;
finalized, the project will follow the initial EMP andthe operating procedures to manage and&#13;
monitor potential negative impacts o f the disposal o f carcasses, excreta, litter, contaminated&#13;
soils, disposal equipmentinaccordance with the advice o f a technical specialist to the Project&#13;
Management Team. These Provisions will be included inthe Project Implementation Manual&#13;
(PIM) to be readypnor to disbursement, and updated as necessary to reflect any changes or&#13;
additions to procedures recommended inthe EMP&#13;
&#13;
To prevent further spreadingo f H5N1,surveillance indomestic poultry as well as inwild birds&#13;
should be strengthened inthe country as it i s along migrating birdroutes. Resources shouldbe&#13;
focused on the reduction o f close contacts betweenhumans, domestic poultry and wildlife&#13;
through better management practices and improved biosecuntypractices inpoultry production&#13;
enterpnses, especially those that are small and 'open-air'- where domestic poultry and waterfowl&#13;
are allowed to mingle with wild birds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                81&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Officials would also need to monitor 'wet' and wildlife markets, where wild and domesticated&#13;
species are kept inclose proximity, which are at nsk o f exposure to a wide range o fpathogens.&#13;
Limitingcontact with wild birds shouldtherefore bepart o f any avian influenza control strategy&#13;
To protect domestic poultry, vaccination should be considered as a tool for the prevention and&#13;
control o fHPAIinat nsk situations.,The control o f avian influenza infection inwild bird&#13;
populations at this stage, i s not feasible - from a logistical, environmental andbiodiversity point&#13;
o f view hdiscnminate culling o f wild migratory birdpopulations would be ineffective in&#13;
preventing further spread o f avian influenza and their huntingwould likely cause dispersion o f&#13;
the birds.&#13;
&#13;
The investments in laboratory facilities, equipment and staff training will improve effectiveness&#13;
and safety o f avian influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting international standards&#13;
established by OIE. If there are existing guidelines from other projects, for the handling of&#13;
medical waste generated in health care facilities, such guidelines will be adapted. The Project&#13;
will also support updating o f these guidelines, training o f healthcare workers to manage medical&#13;
wastes according to these guidelines and, ifnecessary, the purchase o f equipment for the proper&#13;
handling and disposal o f medical waste in participating facilities. These provisions will be&#13;
included inthe PIM.&#13;
&#13;
The Project will assist the government in developing a strategy for managing future emerging&#13;
and re-emerging zoonotic and infectious disease outbreaks. Such a strategy would improve&#13;
environmental and social safeguards inthree areas: (i)       mainstreaming environmental safeguards&#13;
into protocols and procedures for the stamping out and disposal o f animals dunng an outbreak,&#13;
in particular by adopting OIE standards; (ii)improving understanding of the relevant&#13;
practitioners o f waste management systems in health facilities; and (iii)     developing policies on&#13;
compensation for poultry farmers affected by future outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
As an emergency operation under OP/OD 8.50, the safeguard documents are not requiredto be&#13;
preparedand disclosed pnor to appraisal. However, it is expected that the EMP for the carcass&#13;
disposal facilities will need to beprepared and disclosed pnor to the appraisal.&#13;

Strategic Communication. The Project is designed to promote awareness, consensus building,&#13;
support buy-inon mitigation measures by the Afghan public and stakeholders on the Avian and&#13;
Human Influenza Control and Preparedness Emergency Project in the country. This strategy is&#13;
predicated on the fact that pandemic will be slowed down by everyday behavior change, which&#13;
is in turn determined by information and beliefs, and also by sheer plain habit. One o f the&#13;
lessons learned elsewhere around the world from the AIDS epidemic i s that public information&#13;
alone does not necessarily generate action. People's response i s contingent on social networks,&#13;
social beliefs and how they affect behavior as well as resource availability in their community&#13;
Government's role i s to provide enabling policies for restoration o f public health infrastructure&#13;
and preparedness at individual, community and national levels, developing training courses in&#13;
communication methodology and techniques for apcultural extension and vetennary staff,&#13;
health workers, NSP social organizers/facilitators information and National Onentation staff at&#13;
national, local government levels as well as community based groups, such as, CDCs, CBOs, the&#13;
traditional shuras and etc.&#13;
&#13;
The Project is designed to safeguard human health, in particular for extension staff, animal&#13;
health workers, poultry producers and their families, by improving public awareness and&#13;
information. Support will be provided for information and communication activities to increase&#13;
the attention and commitment of government, pnvate sector, and civil society organizations, and&#13;
to raise awareness, knowledge and understandingamong the general population about the nsk&#13;
and potential impact o f the pandemic. It will also involve conducting a rapid social and hygiene&#13;
assessment to investigate household and individual health-related behaviors within `their&#13;
complex, rational matnx of personal, organizational, and social realities. The assessment will&#13;
explore opinions, attitudes, behavior, and motivations o f affected communities, leading to&#13;
understanding o f health, livelihood and other social development issues relevant indesigning an&#13;
effective communication strategy&#13;
&#13;
In Afghanistan, raising chicken is one o f the means o f income generating activities and&#13;
livelihood strategy, and many o f poor farmers and peasants live in close proximity with their&#13;
flocks and depend on poultry production for their survival, often in remote areas. Unlike in&#13;
some other countnes, where poultry production i s largely concentrated in huge enterpnses, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              83&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
scattered and small holdings in Afghanistan pose enormous problems for controlling any&#13;
outbreak.&#13;
&#13;
The fact that the virus o f Avian Influenza does not recognize national boundanes, Highly&#13;
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) strategy should address the migratory nature o f wild birds&#13;
carryng the virus across the borders.&#13;
&#13;
The new environmental law is givingNEPA the mandate o f ensunngthe Environmental&#13;
Management inthe country ingeneral andparticularly among other issues o f the transboundary&#13;
environmental issues and making regulations with regardto EIA o fprojects. Inthis case NEPA&#13;
and its partner UNEP could beplayng a vital role inmaking sure that relevant major&#13;
environmental concerned are adhered to and capacity i s developed inthe relevant implementing&#13;
agencies to comply with the stipulated laws as far as possible given the conditions inthe&#13;
country&#13;

&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The project will include two major categones o f interventions: (i) emergency or short-term&#13;
interventions geared to control and prevent the spread and outbreak o f Avian Influence threat&#13;
to general public in a bio-secure and environmentally fhendly manner; and (ii)   interventions&#13;
for the longer-term that aim to improve existing national capacity, systems, procedures and&#13;
public awarenessto prevent, respond effectively and rapidly to any potential AI threat, and to&#13;
control the situation in the event o f an AI outbreak.       In the initial stage of project&#13;
implementation, the focus will be on emergency interventions. Therefore, the Monitonng and&#13;
Evaluation Framework and Strategy should be capable to provide necessary information to&#13;
policy makers, and related stakeholders, including government agencies on project inputs,&#13;
outputs, outcomes and implementation performance in relation to both these two phases o f&#13;
interventions. Lessons learned during the emetgency phase will also be a learning exercise&#13;
for the government to refine and fine tune medium term interventions thgt will continue&#13;
beyond the emergency phase.&#13;
&#13;
B. M&amp;EApproach&#13;
&#13;
The AHIP places significant emphasis on M&amp;E and sees it as a vehicle for ensunngthat the&#13;
envisaged activities fully reflect the changing environment. The monitonng and evaluation&#13;
(M&amp;E) system is intended to provide information to the relevant stakeholders on project&#13;
implementation performance, process, outputs, and outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
There are a number o f cntical aspects that need to be monitored in order to achieve the&#13;
objectives o f this operation.  In view of the high nsks posed by the AI threat and the&#13;
emergency nature o f the project as well as lack o f pnor expenence with similar projects in&#13;
the country, the M&amp;E system will be dynamic and reflect the changing environment and             '&#13;
&#13;
conditions. The iterative and dynamic M&amp;E approach would ensure that the changing&#13;
environment and lessons learned from implementing the project will be reflected in the&#13;
ensuing project activities. Such an arrangement will and can help emergency response team&#13;
and task forces as well as implementing agencies and partners to introduce early corrective&#13;
measures, which would lead the project to achieve its stipulated objectives in a dynamic&#13;
fashion. A dynamic and continuous monitonng and evaluation system will be established to&#13;
ensure that the project implementation fully reflects the changing environment and i s&#13;
sufficiently flexible to alter the direction and implementation modality o f the project.&#13;
Lessons learned from this project will not only feed into the design and implementation&#13;
strategies of the subsequent phases o f the project but will also contribute to improving the&#13;
design and implementation o f other similar projects inthe country&#13;
&#13;
B.1Organization for M&amp;E&#13;
&#13;
The ultimate responsibility for national level M&amp;E will rest with the National AI Secretanat&#13;
(NAIS). A Project Coordinator will be appointed for implementing the Project and this&#13;
person will work in team with the public health and animal health coordinators for technical&#13;
implementation and in liaison with the Director General o f the General Department for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            90&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Policy and Planning (GDPP) MA1for administrative matters and monitonng and evaluation.&#13;
An Implementation Management Support Team (IMST) has been established for&#13;
coordinating the Horticulture and Livestock Project (HLP) and a lead Facilitating Partner&#13;
(LFP) has been appointed to provide technical assistance specialists to work with Afghan&#13;
coordinators in IMST        The IMST i s headed by a Project Manager who - working in&#13;
collaboration with the Project Director is responsible for project implementation. Appendix&#13;
10provides all details o f the institutional arrangements proposed for the project.&#13;
&#13;
The IMST includes a monitonng and evaluation specialist to help develop the operations of&#13;
the Monitonng and Evaluation Department within GDPP A full time senior officer will be&#13;
designated as M&amp;E specialist for THE PROJECT, working as part o f the M&amp;E team in&#13;
GDPP and in liaison with NAIS. Inaddition, the two implementing ministnes will designate&#13;
staff at their eight zone offices to keep track of project implementation progress, inputs and&#13;
outputs and to provide detailed and frequent reporting to the centre. The frequency o f&#13;
reviews and progress monitonng for the NAIS, TCAI and FCAI will be determined dunng&#13;
the project implementation depending on the levels o f nsk and emergency&#13;
&#13;
Terms o f References for key Project staff, including the M&amp;E specialist, highlighting the&#13;
scope and institutional arrangements o f the M&amp;E system for the proposed project will be&#13;
developed as part o f the Project Operational Manual. Inview o f the emergency nature o f the&#13;
project and the consequent need to achieve efficiency and transparency in project&#13;
procurements and financial management, the M&amp;E specialist will play an overlapping role in&#13;
monitonng some aspects of procurement and financial management o f the project as well.&#13;
The M&amp;E specialist will work together with staff responsible for overall financial&#13;
management, establishing and enforcing transparent systems and procedures to register and&#13;
monitor the disbursement o f financial compensation to the affected poultry farmers.        In&#13;
addition, he/she will also work inclose collaboration with the relevant staff for monitonng o f&#13;
the timely implementation of the procurementplan and external and ex-post procurement and&#13;
financial management audits of the project. Some o f the most important inputs and outputs&#13;
of the project components are presented inAppendix 1. These matnces should be considered&#13;
dynamic, which will be revised from time to bme based on the expenence and lessons&#13;
learned dunng the project implementation.           In addition, the M&amp;E specialist will be&#13;
responsible for organizing, contracting and implementing specific analytical work, research&#13;
and field studies requiredto assess the project's outcomes and impact inline with the Results&#13;
Framework (Appendix 1).         The main aspects o f the proposed M&amp;E are outlined in the&#13;
following sections.&#13;
&#13;
B.2Physical geographic monitonng&#13;
&#13;
The Project M&amp;E specialist will maintain a GIS baseddata base o f the provinces and specific&#13;
geographic locations where the AI virus has been detected and preventive and control&#13;
measures have been carned out. Necessary technical assistancewill be obtained from a local&#13;
IT company to develop the GIS system. The M&amp;E Specialist will produce maps showing&#13;
geographical locations where H5A1 virus have been detected, culling and animal vaccination&#13;
activities have been carried out with other information and statistics such as the number o f&#13;
poultry killed and vaccinated and number of persons treated with preventive vaccines. The&#13;
M&amp;E Specialist will: (i)through its zonal representatives, establish proper communication&#13;
channels for provincial and central level departments o f the two ministnes; and (ii)  help to&#13;
designand improve the data collection and registration formats used by the MOPH and MAI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               91&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
He/she will also ensure that accurate data and information are collected by animal health and,&#13;
human health workers and transmit the information timely from the field to the provincial&#13;
offices and provincial offices to the Secretanat.&#13;
&#13;
B.3Implementation Monitonng and Learning&#13;
&#13;
The success o f the intended AI control program and the achievement o f the intended project&#13;
objectives depend in part on the speed and ability with which all the stakeholders can&#13;
respond to demands o f a changing situation and conditions. Success also depends on the&#13;
diligence with which planned control and prevention measures are implemented with&#13;
satisfactory adherence to the sanitary, environmental and safety requirements o f the program&#13;
as elaborated in Appendix 8 and partly in Appendix 2-1..          It is essential to monitor the&#13;
implementation o f the program not only focusing on the quantitatwe inputs and outputs but&#13;
also covenng the qualitative aspects o f the implementation program. For example, if the&#13;
quality o f protective clothing used by the animal heath workers i s not satisfactory or&#13;
necessary safeguard procedures are not adopted in culling and disposing culled poultry, not&#13;
only the intended benefits o f the program may not be fully achieved but further risk may also&#13;
be generated. Safety standards and appropnate procedures specific to salient implementation&#13;
aspects o f the project will be prepared and translated into local languages for implementation&#13;
in the form of an operation manual. Careful monitonng of the adherence to prescribed&#13;
procedures, standards and safeguards will therefore be a key part o f the monitonng and&#13;
learning o f the project. The monitonng o f project inputs and outputs, both inquantitative and&#13;
qualitative dimensions, will be useful for all project stakeholders, including the emergency&#13;
response team, to rectify the shortcomings on regular basis. Core aspects o f inputs and&#13;
output monitonngwith respect to the project components are illustrated inAppendix I.&#13;
&#13;
B.4Outcome and Impact MonitonnP and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
The outcome and impact monitonng will be guided by the Results Framework, presented in&#13;
Appendix I.The framework shows the major outcome indicators as well as the potential use&#13;
o f the outcome indicators during project implementation. The framework also shows the&#13;
arrangements for results monitonng for each outcome indicator expressed in terms o f&#13;
baseline status, cumulative target values, frequency o f reporting, means o f venfication and&#13;
responsibility for M&amp;E.&#13;
&#13;
C. Implementation'CompletionEvaluation&#13;
&#13;
At the end ofthe project, a comprehensive evaluation o fthe project outputs, outcomes and&#13;
impacts will be carned out by the AI Secretanat. The evaluation will specifically assess&#13;
whether the target set inAnnex Ihadbeen achieved at the end of the project.&#13;
&#13;
IDA will producean Implementation Completion Report, which will focus on evaluating&#13;
whether the project objectives and targets for key performance indicators have been met.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
The institutional arrangement for the Project are based on the responsibilities and capacities&#13;
of existing departments and organizations, using operational guidelines and technical&#13;
capacity specific to the Project. Awareness o f avian influenza (AI) and its control and&#13;
containment are a preoccupation at the highest government level.&#13;
&#13;
Early in 2006 the government established a National Emergency Response Committee&#13;
(NERC) at Vice President-level to address major national emergencies. However, because of&#13;
the senousness of a potential threat from avian influenza it also created a specific National&#13;
Avian Influenza Committee (NAIC) responsible for tackling prevention and control of this&#13;
disease. The NAIC i s supported by two specialized committees (Box 1).&#13;
&#13;
Box 1.Various Actors inthe AI Control,Afghanistan&#13;
&#13;
National Emergency Response Committee (NERC): Headed by the Vice President. This is an inter-&#13;
mnisterial level body that coordinates national level activities, policies and strateges on all national&#13;
emergencies. The c o m t t e e has recently begun discussing issues relating to the AI outbreak in the&#13;
country All policy and strategy issues, inparticular those that concern more than one rmnistry, can be&#13;
addressed in the emergency response c o m t t e e . Since the AI concerns a number o f mnistfles, this&#13;
c o m t t e e will be particularly useful in pursuing specific AI-related policies and strateges and&#13;
ensunng that all concerned rmnistries adhere to the recommendations o f the c o m t t e e . The&#13;
c o m t t e e meets twice per month, which can increase in case o f emergencies.&#13;
National A I Committee (NAIC): This body has recently been established, just before the outbreak of&#13;
AI in Afghanistan      111March 2006. It is headed by the Mimster o f MAI. The members o f the&#13;
c o m t t e e include: Ministryo f Public Health (MOPH), Ministry o f Finance (MoF), Ministry o f Rural&#13;
Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA),&#13;
Ministry o f Commerce, Ministry o f Interior and the Mimstry o f Foreign Affairs. This is the main&#13;
coordination unit for national level AIpolicies, plans o f action and activities. The NAIC reports to the&#13;

            The Afghanistan Avian and Human
            Influenza Control and Preparedness Emergency Project has the
            objective to minimize the threat posed by Highly Pathogenic
            Avian Influenza (HPAI) to humans in Afghanistan by
            controlling such infections among birds, especially domestic
            poultry, and preparing for, controlling, and responding to
            possible human infections, especially an influenza epidemic
            and related emergencies. . The project components are: (i)
            animal health, (ii) human health, (iii) communications and
            public awareness, and (iv) institutional coordination and
            project management.
