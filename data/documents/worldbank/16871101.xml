                 Tanzania continues to stand out as a                            as in speciï¬?c debates of topical importance&#13;
                 model of sound economic performance in                          in Tanzania. The current issue seeks to get&#13;
                 the African continent, with a growth rate                       the discussion going on how to achieve&#13;
                 of over six per cent in 2011 and 2012,                          the structural transformation of the rural&#13;

                 story: the failure of growth to impact those                    does not have to be enduring. The present&#13;
                 who make up 80 per cent of the population                       update points to three forces that have&#13;
                 in Tanzania. Despite impressive macro-ï¬?scal                     the potential to produce transformational&#13;

                 in Tanzania has been concentrated in a few                      to provoke debate on one of the most&#13;
                 capital-intensive sectors such as mining and                    important and until now intractable&#13;
                 telecoms, and soon natural gas â&#128;&#147; failing to                     challenges facing Tanzania. As a partner of&#13;

&amp;#12;       Part 1: The state of the economy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Main points&#13;
       Â&#132;&amp;#3; Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s economy performed extremely well in 2011/12,&#13;
          recording solid growth and ï¬?scal discipline despite rising inï¬&#130;ation.&#13;
       Â&#132;&amp;#3; The countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic prospects are positive with its GDP&#13;
          forecast to grow at a rate of 6.5-7.0 over the period 2012 - 2014.&#13;
          However, the exogenous threats cannot be ignored.&#13;
       Â&#132;&amp;#3; In 2012/13, ï¬?scal policy will remain the main instrument to promote&#13;
          economic growth. This will be achieved through a combination of&#13;
          higher spending and increasing prioritization of expenditure on&#13;
          infrastructure. The expansion of the private sector will continue&#13;
          to be in capital-intensive sectors, except for the construction&#13;
          sector which will beneï¬?t from the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s infrastructure&#13;
          development program and from foreign investments in the&#13;
          extractive industries.&#13;
       Â&#132;&amp;#3; To secure ï¬?scal and debt sustainability and to ensure the optimal&#13;
          use of public resources, close monitoring of public accounts is&#13;
          required. This monitoring should extend to public agencies and&#13;

  Highlights from the 2012/13 Budget&#13;
  The approved 2012/13 Budget demonstrates ï¬?scal restraint, with a projected deï¬?cit&#13;
  of 5.5 percent of GDP. This level of deï¬?cit is in line with the IMF program. The ï¬?scal&#13;
  framework is built on the combination of:&#13;
  s2!2SIGNIlCANT2INCREASE2IN2DOMESTIC2REVENUES2&amp;#8;BY2&amp;#17;&amp;#22;2PERCENT2IN2REAL2TERMS2COMPARED2&#13;

  under the IMF program.&#13;
  The above budget framework, however, does not capture all public expenditures. In&#13;
  particular, it does not include expenditures by public enterprises and agencies. For&#13;
  example, the Tanzanian Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) will execute&#13;
  a new pipeline involving a total expenditure of USD1.2 billion, of which $ 800 million&#13;
  (or 10 percent of total public expenditure) will be spent during 2012/13. If the TPDCâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
  expenditure on the pipeline is taken into account, total public expenditures increase by&#13;
  13.7 percent in real terms, while the consolidated ï¬?scal deï¬?cit of the State will reach&#13;
  8.3 percent of GDP.&#13;

                               Infrastructure spending and economic growth&#13;
&#13;
                               The stock of infrastructure in Tanzania is one of the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa, slightly&#13;
                               above the level reported in Madagascar and Burkina Faso. Tanzania has 2.1 times fewer&#13;
                               paved roads than Uganda; it produces 10 times less electricity per capita than Mozambique,&#13;
                               and owns 15 times fewer ï¬?xed phone lines per capita than South Africa. These shortfalls&#13;
                               are major bottlenecks for economic growth as they make it more difï¬?cult for ï¬?rms to do&#13;
                               business given the constraints with regard to moving goods and people.&#13;
&#13;
                               The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s effort to focus on the development of infrastructure is warranted&#13;
                               given the success of most emerging countries that have allocated a signiï¬?cant share&#13;
                               of their resources for this purpose. For example, Korea, Malaysia and Chile have each&#13;
                               spent roughly two dollars on infrastructure projects for each dollar spent within the&#13;
                               social sectors in their early stages of their development, with this ratio becoming more&#13;
                               balanced in subsequent stages.&#13;
&#13;
                               Using the calibration results from a World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s paper, it is estimated that Tanzania could&#13;
                               increase its per capita growth by 2 and 5 percent respectively if it could reach the level of&#13;
                               infrastructure development in Uganda and South Africa. These ï¬?gures are indicative, and&#13;
                               do account for quality of spending but merely illustrate the close relationship between&#13;
                               the stock infrastructure and economic growth.&#13;

&amp;#12;       Part 2: Fighting rural poverty: no other&#13;
               way around for Tanzania&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Main points&#13;
        Â&#132;&amp;#3; In macroeconomic terms, Tanzania is a success story. However,&#13;
           its success has not translated into improved conditions for a large&#13;
           proportion of rural households, who constitute approximately&#13;
           30 million people or about 75 percent of the total population. A&#13;
           signiï¬?cant proportion of these households live today under conditions&#13;
           very similar to their parents or even their grandparents.&#13;
        Â&#132;&amp;#3; Successful countries are those that have connected their farmers to&#13;
           markets, encouraged them to produce high-value products rather than&#13;
           traditional crops, and managed migration ï¬&#130;ows toward urban centers.&#13;
        Â&#132;&amp;#3; Fighting rural poverty requires a major policy shift. Simply tinkering&#13;
           at the edges will not do it. The shift must be toward: (i) agricultural&#13;
           commercialization, (ii) diversiï¬?cation and (iii) urbanization.&#13;
        Â&#132;&amp;#3; The challenge for the Tanzanian policymakers is not only to stimulate&#13;
           these three transformational forces, but also to manage them&#13;
           appropriately over time.&#13;
&#13;
       Poverty arithmetic is an important tool               as rural poor (see Table 1). The high level of rural&#13;
       for the comprehensive evaluation of the               poverty persists despite the fact that the country&#13;
       economic performance of a country. This               is, arguably, blessed with good rains and fertile&#13;
       is particularly true in Tanzania, where, despite      soils, and that it has placed agriculture at the&#13;
       the impressive macroeconomic performance,             center of successive national strategies.&#13;

            Tanzania economic update : spreading the wings
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Tanzania continues to stand out as a
            model of sound economic performance in the African
            continent, with a growth rate of over six per cent in 2011
            and 2012, surpassing other regional economies and
            demonstrating impressive resilience to the global economic
            crisis. This is the second issue of the Tanzania economic
            update series. The series aim to engage a broad audience in
            a discussion of the state of the economy in general, as well
            as in specific debates of topical importance in Tanzania.
            The current issue seeks to get the discussion going on how
            to achieve the structural transformation of the rural
            economy so that rural households can also benefit from the
            country's remarkable growth performance.
