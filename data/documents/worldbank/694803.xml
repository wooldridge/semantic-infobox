1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Government of China (GOC) has requested Bank assistance in financing the&#13;
Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project. The proposed project would reduce infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks due to extreme water shortages, increase employment and thereby reduce&#13;
poverty, decrease human distress due to intermittent and limited water supplies, and&#13;
improve water quality in the river systems. Project objectives would be achieved by&#13;
diverting water from the Yellow River through tunnels and pipelines to industrial cities in&#13;
northern Shanxi.&#13;
1.2   Most of China's impressive economic growth since 1978 (9.5 percent per year)&#13;
has occurred in the industrial and commercial sectors, which are concentrated in urban&#13;
areas. As a result, urban area demand for water increased over 500 percent since 1978,&#13;
but available water supplies have been able to meet only 20 percent of that increase. By&#13;
1995, 400 of China's 514 largest cities suffered water shortages, with 100 of them,&#13;
located in the North China Plain (NCP) characterized as "desperately short" of water.&#13;
The economic loss due to these water shortages has been estimated at $12 billion per&#13;
year. The shortages also affect the domestic sector. Household consumption in NCP&#13;
cities averages between 20 and 50 liters per capita per day (l/c/d). The absolute&#13;
minimum for physiological and personal hygiene needs is considered to be 20 l/c/d. The&#13;
shortages have also had adverse environment impacts as local surface water has been&#13;
completely exhausted, and groundwater seriously overdrawn, leading to land subsidence&#13;
in some cities, and salt water intrusion in coastal areas. The reasons for these shortages&#13;
are straightforward. The NCP contains 40 percent of China's land and 45 percent of its&#13;
population, but only 10 percent of its water resources. The estimated annual water&#13;
deficits of 5 billion cubic meters (mi3) in the municipal and industrial sectors, and 35&#13;
billion m3 in agriculture amount to more than 70 percent of the average annual flow of the&#13;
Yellow River, the largest in North China. GOC has given top priority to alleviating these&#13;
water shortages. The longer-term "strategic" plan calls for massive water transfers from&#13;
the South, which has 80 percent of the country's water resources, to the North via the&#13;
Yellow River. The shorter-term "tactical" strategy includes medium-distance transfers&#13;
from the Yellow River to those cities most critically in need of water, including Qingdao&#13;
in Shandong Province, Beijing-Tianjin, and the industrial/mining cities of northern&#13;
Shanxi Province-the focus of this Project. These transfers will involve water previously&#13;
allocated by the State Council, and are consistent with national goals of economic and&#13;
social development, and maximum efficient use of Yellow River water.&#13;
1.3   Shanxi Province is located in northeastern China, bounded by the Yellow River to&#13;
the west and south. The current population is over 30 million, 23 percent of which is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
urban and growing at an annual rate of 3.15 percent. Although agriculture is the principal&#13;
source of employment, the northern areas are highly industrialized. Northern Shanxi is&#13;
called China's "energy base" due to its vast coal deposits and electricity production,&#13;
which in 1993, was 41,700 million kilowatt-hours (kWh), or 7 percent of the national&#13;
total (25 percent of which was delivered to the North China grid). In the same year, coal&#13;
production reached 310 million tons, or 30 percent of the national total. In addition to&#13;
coal and power, Shanxi produces significant amounts of chemicals, metallurgical and&#13;
electronics goods. Overall economic growth has kept pace with the national level, with&#13;
an average real rate of 13.5 percent since 1990.&#13;
1.4   The province is relatively poor in water resources: It has the least water resources&#13;
per capita (470 mi3) in the Yellow River Basin, and is the second driest province (after&#13;
Ningxia) in terms of surface water resources. These are widely scattered among 15 river&#13;
basins, which are separated by mountains, making interbasin transfers difficult. River&#13;
flows exhibit a high degree of annual variation, although they are concentrated in the&#13;
summer. In most areas, groundwater has been tapped to its limits. Moreover, irrigated&#13;
agriculture has suffered most from water shortages: Although irrigation covers about 1 .1&#13;
million hectares (ha) or 30 percent of the cultivated area, only 50 percent have adequate&#13;
supplies, and some have received no water at all in recent years. To make matters worse,&#13;
in the northern industrial region, mining has severely affected water quality.&#13;
1.5   The most important economic impacts of the water shortage are felt in the&#13;
northern urban industrial areas in the cities of Taiyuan (the capital and largest city),&#13;
Datong (the second-largest city and mining center), and Pingshuo (a rapidly growing&#13;
mining/industrial region). In the first two, surface water supplies have virtually dried up,&#13;
and groundwater has been overextracted to a degree leading to land subsidence of over&#13;
3 meters (m) in many places. As a result, all sectors and population groups have suffered.&#13;
Farmers have sometimes resorted to irrigating with untreated industrial waste; miners are&#13;
often unable to bathe because of a lack of water; people living above the third floor have&#13;
no piped supply because pressures are too low; and industries have been forced to&#13;
extraordinary lengths and expense to conserve water. By 2000, water demands in these&#13;
three areas will outstrip supplies by a factor of 70 percent, with the gap growing much&#13;
wider afterwards.&#13;
1.6   The project would help alleviate these shortages through the construction of a&#13;
water transmission line from the Yellow River at Wanjiazhai Dam to Taiyuan, and later&#13;
to Datong and Pingshuo. Taiyuan would be served by a southern tunnel branching off a&#13;
general line into the Fen River. The other areas would be served by a northern branch,&#13;
passing through the proposed Daliang reservoir, beginning about 2005. The entire project&#13;
will deliver up to 320 million m3 per year in 2002, 900 million mi3 by 2010, and 1.2&#13;
billion mi3 by 2020. These volumes are within the allocations permitted by the Yellow&#13;
River allocation designated by the State Council, and ultimately will result in a 25 percent&#13;
increase in provincial water consumption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

B. PROJECT ORIGIN AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.7  In 1964, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) conducted a study&#13;
for the Basin and key water control projects, including the Wanjiazhai Dam Project for&#13;
diverting water to Shanxi, were identified. In 1986, the Basin plan was updated and the&#13;
conclusions of the 1964 study were reconfirmed. The study concluded that Shanxi&#13;
Province's main source of water will be from the main branch of the Yellow River. The&#13;
provincial Government started its investigation of the Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project&#13;
in 1984 and, with the help of the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), completed the&#13;
studies and preliminary designs in 1992. The State Council approved the plan in 1993.&#13;
MWR simultaneously completed the feasibility study of the Wanjiazhai Dam and&#13;
preliminary designs in 1993, and construction for the dam was started in late 1994.&#13;
1.8  In March 1992, the Bank and YRCC carried out the Yellow River Investment&#13;
Planning Study (Report No. 11146-CHA, June 30, 1993), which sought to place&#13;
investment options in a consistent, basinwide economic framework. The study evaluated&#13;
options with respect to the development goals and physical and economic constraints.&#13;
Three interbasin transfers of water (Qingdao City transfer; Wanjiazhai transfer to&#13;
Taiyuan, Datong and Shuozhou; and the Hebei-Tianjin transfer) show a 25 percent&#13;
increase in net annual regional economic value added (Y 16.5 billion) due to more&#13;
rational usage of Yellow River water resources. The study concludes that these transfers&#13;
are some of the highest priorities for water use in the Basin.&#13;
1.9   The proposed project will therefore: (a) help meet the water needs of the northern&#13;
urban areas so as to alleviate structural bottlenecks and permit economic growth to&#13;
continue; (b) reduce the environmental impacts of land subsidence due to overextraction&#13;
of groundwater; (c) promote commercialization and corporatization of major water&#13;
resource project offices; and (d) upgrade the institutional and accounting capabilities of&#13;
the Shanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, and support the creation of the Upper Fen River&#13;
Basin Corporation for operational and water pricing functions.&#13;
C. BANK LENDING TO DEVELOP THE YELLOW RIVER BASIN&#13;
1.10  The Bank has helped finance 11 land and water resource development projects in&#13;
the Yellow River Basin. These projects focus on reducing poverty by raising agricultural&#13;
production through irrigation and drainage systems. Two of the projects involved a dam&#13;
on the Yellow River [Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project (Loan 3727-CHA)] and the&#13;
associated resettlement [Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project (Credit 2605-CHA)]. These&#13;
projects are unique in that they were a multipurpose effort aimed at improving flood&#13;
control for about 103 million people, providing water supplies for 15 cities with water&#13;
shortages, and improving water for 2 million ha of poorly served irrigation areas. The&#13;
most recent efforts in the Basin include the Loess Plateau Project (Credit 2616-CHA),&#13;
which aims to improve watersheds to prevent further soil erosion, and the Shanxi Poverty&#13;
Alleviation Project (Credit 2834-CHA), which is designed to directly improve irrigation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
areas, and provide water supply and terracing for poor areas in Western Shanxi along the&#13;
Yellow River.&#13;
D. LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS BANK PROJECTS&#13;
1.11  Although the Bank has assisted in 11 water resource and irrigation projects in the&#13;
Yellow River basin, the most important lessons for this project were drawn from the&#13;
Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project and hydropower projects in other parts of China such as&#13;
the Shuikou Hydroelectric (Loan 2775-CHA) and Ertan Hydroelectric projects (Loan 3387-&#13;
CHA), which had large construction components. The lessons include: (a) the project&#13;
should be reviewed by a technical panel of international experts, as this improves the&#13;
design, economic assessment, and resettlement; (b) civil works procurement packaging and&#13;
joint ventures should be arranged between foreign and local contractors to obtain transfer of&#13;
technology and best international practices; (c) procurement for major civil works should&#13;
begin early so that bid awards will correspond with loan effectiveness and thus avoid delays&#13;
and cost overruns; (d) prequalification criteria should be stringent to ensure that all partners&#13;
of foreign and local joint ventures can meet their responsibilities; and (e) resettlement plans,&#13;
safety nets and budgets should be adequate. An action plan has been incorporated into the&#13;
project to ensure proper implementation of the resettlement component.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.12  Consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for China presented to the&#13;
Board on March 18, 1997, the proposed project supports development efforts focused on:&#13;
China's poorer interior provinces; alleviating infrastructural constraints to continued&#13;
economic development; enterprise reform by commercializing operations and, inter alia,&#13;
introducing rational pricing. and fostering environmental protection for river basins. In&#13;
this regard, the project would ease infrastructural constraints in the water supply sector&#13;
that are now impeding Shanxi's economic and industrial growth, with consequent effects&#13;
on increasing employment and poverty alleviation. It would also relieve periodic&#13;
municipal water shortages; and improve the environment by reducing dependency on&#13;
groundwater resources and introducing modern water treatment facilities. By supporting&#13;
the creation of water resource corporations at various levels and commercializing those&#13;
operations by enabling them to trade water and set prices at commercial rates, the project&#13;
supports enterprise reform. And, for technology transfer, project tunnels-some of the&#13;
longest in the world -would be constructed by double-shielded boring machines, and&#13;
use of a master computer-controlled supervisory system would optimize pumping rates to&#13;
save energy costs.&#13;

2. PROJECT AREAS&#13;
A. SHANXI PROVINCE&#13;
2.1   Shanxi Province is located in northeastern China between 1 10°3O' and 114045'&#13;
east longitude and 34°30' and 40025' north latitude.  The western and southern&#13;
boundaries are the Yellow River. Neighboring provinces are Nei Mongol (north), Hebei&#13;
(east), Henan (south) and Shaanxi (west). The northeastern corner of Shanxi is&#13;
approximately 150 km from Beijing.&#13;
2.2   The geography of the province is characterized by a series of mountain chains&#13;
with elevation ranging between 1,500 and 3,000 m and alluvial plains situated between&#13;
600 and 1,100 m. Fifteen river subbasins are scattered throughout: The largest two, Fen&#13;
and Qin, cover most of the southern two-thirds of the province and are major tributaries&#13;
of the Yellow River. Mean annual precipitation is 524 millimeters (mm). The northwest&#13;
is driest (less than 400 mm) while the southwest is relatively wet (600 to 800 mm);&#13;
however, 70 percent of precipitation occurs in June through August.&#13;
2.3   Population is just over 30 million, with 23 percent classified as urban and 77&#13;
percent as rural. It has grown at 1.25 percent annually since 1990, with urban population&#13;
2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#13;
increasing at 3.15 percent. With a surface area of 156,270 square kilometers (km ),&#13;
population density in the province is 192 per km2, or 45 percent higher than the national&#13;
average. Of the 6,941,000 urban population in 1993, 2,588,000 (37 percent) resided in&#13;
the project areas, 1,720,000 in Taiyuan alone. Agriculture, subject to the vagaries of the&#13;
weather (given insufficient water for irrigation), has exhibited modest real growth since&#13;
1990 (Table 2.1). But the industrial sector grew by an average annual rate of 18.5&#13;
percent. This performance is remarkable in that it occurred in an environment that&#13;
experiences severe water shortages.&#13;

2.4   Within the nonagricultural sectors, coal production was the most significant,&#13;
achieving 26.9 percent of total industrial output value, followed by "other" (commerce,&#13;
services and transportation) at 23 percent, metallurgy (16.9 percent), manufacturing (15.3&#13;
percent), chemicals (11.7 percent) and electricity (6.7 percent). The last sector would&#13;
have had a much larger share had it not been for the existence of price controls, which&#13;
limits the value of its output to about 45 percent of it economic value. Clearly, Shanxi's&#13;
economy is not only highly industrialized and growing, but its industrial structure is&#13;
highly interdependent. Emerging bottlenecks, such as a water constraints that affect one&#13;
or more sectors, are beginning to have severe negative impacts throughout the provincial&#13;
economy. Since other parts of China rely heavily on Shanxi's products as critical inputs,&#13;
production problems would have a wide impact throughout the country.&#13;
2.5    Water Resources. Mean annual surface water runoff in the Shanxi Province&#13;
from  1956 through 1984 was 10.87 billion m3.  Annual exploitable groundwater&#13;
resources total 9.31 billion m3. However, 6.36 billion m3 of the groundwater and surface&#13;
water is double counted, implying that the actual average annual total water resource is&#13;
13.8 billion m . Water consumption in 1993 was 5.57 billion m3, of which 10 percent&#13;
was pumped from nonlocal sources. There are several reasons why this picture is not&#13;
nearly so optimistic as may first appear: (a) surface runoff varies greatly, and in one out&#13;
of four years, it is 6.35 billion m3 or less; (b) 7.84 billion m3 (71 percent) of surface&#13;
runoff occurs in subbasins that lay south or east of the northern demand centers and are&#13;
separated from them by long distances and/or mountain ranges; (c) runoff is concentrated&#13;
in a few summer months whereas municipal and industrial demand is year-long; and (d)&#13;
surface water flows have declined in key parts of the province in recent years. In the&#13;
Upper Fen Basin, which supplies the Taiyuan project area, surface water flows averaged&#13;
180 million m3/year before 1970, but only 47 million since 1988. This was partly due to&#13;
terracing and damming of large areas upstream of the city, and to lowered groundwater&#13;
tables (because of overpumping), which have led to greater seepage from streambeds.&#13;
Together, these factors imply that surface water resources are virtually exhausted where&#13;
and when the water is needed; the same is true of groundwater. Adjusting for double-&#13;
counted water, annual exploitable groundwater is estimated to be 2.69 billion m3. In&#13;
1992, 3.45 billion mi3 was consumed (given distribution losses, a much greater volume&#13;
was actually pumped).&#13;
2.6   Irrigation still uses more water than any other sector, with nearly 65 percent of&#13;
total consumption, but this percentage has been falling rapidly (see Table 2.2). Indeed,&#13;
the negligible growth in irrigation is evidence that water supplies have been virtually&#13;
exhausted everywhere in Shanxi as only about 80 percent of irrigable land can be treated,&#13;
and most crops receive only one-half the water recommended. If other water were&#13;
available, farmers would quickly use it to obtain the high marginal returns from&#13;
irrigation. In parts of the project area, farmers have been observed using untreated&#13;
wastewater, an unacceptable practice that the proposed project will help eliminate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

2.7   Most surprising is that Shanxi industries have been able to maintain rapid growth&#13;
in output despite the slow growth in water supplies. In general, they have done so&#13;
through a combination of investments in water, increased recycling, and purchasing water&#13;
from local farmers, with some paying Y 1 0/m3 or more. This latter practice probably&#13;
results in water use being underreported. Such sales are illegal, and the project will seek&#13;
to promote free and efficient markets for water, since informal markets are beneficial to&#13;
3&#13;
both parties: Marginal returns from irrigation are seldom above Y 4/m , but they are&#13;
generally higher than Y 20/mr3 in industry. In 1980, Shanxi industries obtained Y 22/m3&#13;
of water; by 1990, the figure rose to 48 and exceeded 75 in 1994 (all in constant 1990&#13;
yuan). Industrial recycling of water reached 84 percent in 1993, and the province's major&#13;
industries already exceeded the 2000 China norms.&#13;
2.8   If groundwater use is kept at sustainable levels and nonlocal water resources are&#13;
excluded, Shanxi will have only about 4.2 billion m3 of reliable water supplies per year.&#13;
However, current consumption exceeds this figure by 30 percent and by 40 percent in the&#13;
project areas. Forecasts of water demand show how critical the future water balance may&#13;
become: Provincial Water Commission (PWC)-sponsored research concludes that&#13;
demand will reach 11.1 billion m3 by 2000, 13.0 by 2010, and 15.1 by 2020, despite rapid&#13;
improvements in the efficiency of water use.&#13;
B. THE PROJECT AREAS&#13;
2.9   The areas to be served by the project are those that have the highest water demand&#13;
and the most severe shortages, and the greatest potential for economic growth. While&#13;
they contain just 12.5 percent of the population, they produce 29 percent of provincial&#13;
industrial total output, over 40 percent of coal, electricity, metallurgical, and chemical&#13;
output, and contain only 7 percent of its water resources (see Table 2.3).&#13;

2.10   Taiyuan. Located in north-central Shanxi along the Fen River and near abundant&#13;
raw materials and energy sources, Taiyuan contains one of the largest concentrations of&#13;
heavy industry in China. The area to be served includes the city, its suburbs and Gujiao,&#13;
the adjacent county. Per capita water resources are only 51 percent of the provincial&#13;
average, and 9 percent of the country's. Due to water shortages, 50 percent of its mines,&#13;
factories, and enterprises periodically close, which lowers productivity: For example,&#13;
Taiyuan Chemical Industry Company, the largest chemical and fertilizer producer in the&#13;
province, has a water demand of 3,200 m 3/hour but obtains only 1,080, which results in a&#13;
60 percent shortfall in output. For all Taiyuan industries, it has been estimated that 1993&#13;
industrial output (Y 18.3 billion) would have been Y21.1 billion (+15 percent) if the&#13;
water shortage had been alleviated, and only Y 12.8 billion (-30 percent) if groundwater&#13;
use had been held to sustainable levels.&#13;
2.11   Datong. Located in northeastern Shanxi near the Sangan River, Datong is the&#13;
center of China's largest coal mining area and is an important electricity supplier to the&#13;
North China grid and Beijing. The project area includes Datong city and suburbs, and&#13;
Datong and Xinrong counties. Per capita water resources are only 230 m3, 43 percent of&#13;
the provincial average, and 8.4 percent of China's. Datong Mining Bureau operates the&#13;
largest coal mine in China, and requires 163,000 m3/day for its operations and workers'&#13;
needs. It receives only 90,500. Since part of the raw coal cannot be washed, revenue&#13;
losses per year are nearly Y 800 million. Worker sanitation is a problem as pit drainage&#13;
water is often the only available water source for bathing. Miners carry their own potable&#13;
supplies to work with them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
2.12  Pingshuo. The Pingshuo project area includes Shuozhou City and suburbs, and&#13;
parts of Shanyin, Zuoyun, and Youyu counties. The current situation in Shuozhou City is&#13;
not yet as critical as in Taiyuan and Datong for two reasons. First, the Shentou Spring&#13;
has been tapped for much of the area's water supplies, and large volumes of water have&#13;
been "borrowed" from local irrigators. The borrowed water is to be returned when water&#13;
from the proposed project is available. The spring has shown indications of drying up.&#13;
From a long-term average of 7.15 m3/second, discharge dropped to 4.44 in 1993-all of&#13;
which was consumed.  Planned construction of new industries, mines, and other&#13;
enterprises has been postponed pending assurance of additional water supplies.&#13;
2.13  The rationale for the Project centers around the existence and impacts of the&#13;
shortages and the ability of the project to alleviate them so that economic growth can&#13;
continue, coal and electricity can continue to be exported to Beijing and other important&#13;
areas, and the ecological degradation can be halted. Water deficits began to appear in&#13;
these areas in the late 1980s and have been intensifying. Table 2.4 summarizes water&#13;
demand, supply and deficits for 1993. "Demand" here means actual 1993 consumption&#13;
increased to account for estimates of shortages in the urban, industrial, and agricultural&#13;
sectors.  The first "deficit" column is the shortage based on actual surface and&#13;
groundwater usage and amounts to 24 percent of demand. The last column takes into&#13;
account the serious overdraft of groundwater in Taiyuan and Datong and the borrowing of&#13;
water from irrigators in Pingshuo. If groundwater usage were held to safe (sustainable)&#13;
yields, and Pingshuo farmers allowed to retain their supplies, then the true deficit in 1993&#13;
was nearly 400 million m3, or almost 40 percent of demand.&#13;

2.14  The water shortages are felt by all sectors and consuming groups. Farmers around&#13;
the project areas get only about 25 percent of their needs, which explains why they&#13;
scavenge for wastewater. Urban households reportedly consume about 40 liters/day on&#13;
average (the norm for large Chinese cities is 160). But a recent survey showed that half&#13;
of surveyed people in Taiyuan get only 20 liters/day or less.&#13;

C. PROJECTED WATER SHORTAGES IN THE PROJECT AREAS&#13;
2.15   Estimated sustainable local water supplies are shown in Table 2.5 for runoff&#13;
probabilities of 50, 75, and 95 percent, and sustainable groundwater withdrawals. Both&#13;
categories of water may be overstated as they are based on long-term averages. As&#13;
mentioned above, both surface water and groundwater have been declining, particularly&#13;
around the project cities.&#13;

2.16   Because the supply of local water resources is absolutely fixed (and probably&#13;
declining), shortages can only intensify in the future as population grows, and the mining,&#13;
energy and industrial sectors continue to develop at rapid rates. Table 2.6 summarizes the&#13;
projected water demands by project area as developed by the project staff. By combining&#13;

/a Decline in industrial output due to increasing domestic water consumption, which&#13;
deprives industry of water.&#13;
2.17  In 2000, water shortages are 41 percent of demand, 52 percent in 2010, and 61&#13;
percent in 2020. The economic impacts of the shortages will fall disproportionately on&#13;
the industrial sector since the allocation policies give priority to human consumption.&#13;
2.18  Table 2.7 illustrates the gravity of the future situation if the project is not&#13;
undertaken. The top block contains forecasts of industrial (nonagricultural) output on the&#13;
assumption of sufficient water that can only be met by the project. The second block&#13;
projects output if only sustainable supplies of local water are available assuming that&#13;
farmers' shares of available water will be kept constant at 1992 levels and all human&#13;
consumption demands are met. The bottom blocks show the forgone output if the project&#13;
is not undertaken. By 2020, 91 percent of potential output will be lost without the&#13;
project, which explains why the drastic steps of physically moving the industrial base out&#13;
of Shanxi or of moving Taiyuan to the bank of the Yellow River, have been mentioned in&#13;
Government circles as a distinct possibility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
D. OPTIONS FOR SOLVING WATER SHORTAGE PROBLEM&#13;
2.19  Consideration of a major water supply project such as this must be predicated on&#13;
an exhaustive review of alternatives such as imposing higher water prices, conservation,&#13;
increased recycling and reuse, reallocations of existing water from other areas and uses,&#13;
and even the consequences of accepting drastically lower economic growth.&#13;
2.20  Prices. Historically, water prices in Shanxi, as elsewhere in China, have been&#13;
low. Farmers have been paying Y 0.1 5/m3 or less, and industries and households, about&#13;
Y I/mi3 (see paras. 6.14-6.15). These costs are well below the marginal economic returns&#13;
and estimated willingness-to-pay. Therefore, it might be argued that the "shortage" is in&#13;
fact artificial, and that a more rational set of prices would clear the water markets and&#13;
render the Project unnecessary. Ordinarily, higher prices would have two effects: an&#13;
incentive to conserve water, and an incentive to trade water from lower-productivity uses&#13;
to higher. As noted below, conservation efforts have probably reached a technical&#13;
maximum; measures of water use efficiency have increased sharply over the past decade,&#13;
and are now leveling off. If further substantial gains were possible, then one would not&#13;
observe idle and underused factories and mines. In the household sector, about half of&#13;
Taiyuan's residents are consuming one fourth of the national average, and many, only&#13;
one eighth. It is inconceivable that higher prices would uncover significant "waste" of&#13;
water. "Grassroots" water markets have appeared in some areas. Transactions have been&#13;
observed whereby farmers sell water to industries at prices ranging from Y 5 to Y 1 0/m3.&#13;
Because these transactions are voluntary and economically motivated, they undoubtedly&#13;
favor both parties. However, agricultural water is seldom available where and when&#13;
industries need it, and the scope for expanding these markets is therefore small. In fact, if&#13;
all agricultural water in the Project area could be sold to industries and households, the&#13;
estimated water deficit in 2001 would decline by only 24 percent.&#13;
2.21   The supply of water to the Project areas is virtually inelastic. This is evidenced&#13;
by the fact that economic growth has not led to higher consumption and neither&#13;
increasing shortages nor price increases have led to decreased consumption, either within&#13;
the Project areas, or in the entire Province. Higher prices therefore would serve only to&#13;
transfer revenues from consumers to water supply entities. Heretofore, supply costs have&#13;
been low, largely associated with costs of groundwater pumping and O&amp;M cost of the&#13;
surface water storage and distribution system (see para. 5.11). Costs of measures to&#13;
augment the supply of water have not been considered, because such sources effectively&#13;
do not exist except for the project. The project now provides an estimate of the marginal&#13;
costs of water supply, and these costs are substantially above the costs of supply existing&#13;
water and the prices currently paid. If the "new"V water is to be used efficiently, and the&#13;
Project is to be financially viable, then it is clear that prices must be increased. The&#13;
project thus provides the backdrop and the rationale for instituting a more rational pricing&#13;
system. Associated with the project will be a pricing reform policy that raises water&#13;
charges to approximately the marginal economic cost of new water, yet ensures that most&#13;
water consumers will continue to have the ability to pay for water (see para. 5.18 and&#13;
Table 5.1). The new prices will apply to all water consumed in the Project area to ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
that substitution of "old" water for "new" is not encouraged. Water costs are a small&#13;
component of household and enterprise budgets, and will remain within manageable&#13;
limits even under the new price structure.&#13;
2.22  Conservation. Conservation means reducing waste and curtailing water supplies&#13;
to marginal uses. In northern Shanxi, there is virtually no waste. Water utilization ratios&#13;
are probably the highest in China. While there are water-using activities that exhibit low&#13;
returns (e.g., agriculture), these cannot be termed "marginal" given the necessity to&#13;
maintain  subsistence and incomes for millions of poor rural people.   Water&#13;
recycling/reuse, which now stands at 85 percent, has produced remarkable gains in the&#13;
productivity of water used by industries and mines. One study has shown that most&#13;
investment in Shanxi industries over the last decade has gone toward conserving water&#13;
and the marginal gains to such investment are approaching zero.&#13;
2.23  Reallocation. In 1993, irrigation accounted for 40 million m3 (21.4 percent of&#13;
total consumption) in Datong and 83 million m3 (19 percent) in Taiyuan. Irrigation&#13;
consumption as a percentage of total consumption has been declining as water has been&#13;
diverted to municipal and industrial (M&amp;I) uses or sold by farmers who have water&#13;
rights.&#13;
2.24  However, not all of the current irrigation supplies could be diverted to M&amp;I uses&#13;
in the project areas. Irrigation demands are seasonal, peaking in the spring, whereas M&amp;I&#13;
demands are relatively constant throughout the year. The larger irrigated areas are not&#13;
located near the cities so that measurable reallocation would require investments in both&#13;
surface water storage and conveyance. Those irrigated areas located near the project&#13;
cities supply important and valuable produce to those cities. These products would be&#13;
difficult and costly to procure elsewhere. However, the most important justification for&#13;
not reallocating from irrigation has to do with poverty alleviation. Most of Shanxi's poor&#13;
are rural and most rural residents rely on agriculture for the bulk of their incomes.&#13;
Without irrigation, agriculture in Shanxi is a precarious undertaking due to low and&#13;
unpredictable rainfall. Irrigated yields are double those of rainfed land and could be&#13;
much higher were irrigation water available in ample supplies. Agricultural incomes are&#13;
quadrupled when crops are irrigated. In 1994, farm wages were only 33 percent of wages&#13;
in manufacturing. Thus, any further reallocation of water from farmers would have&#13;
serious negative income effects on farmers who are already the poorest population&#13;
segment.&#13;
2.25  Without the proposed project, slower economic growth is a virtual certainty and in&#13;
the project areas, a general economic decline would be highly probable. With current&#13;
water shortages in the project areas amounting to 40 percent of estimated demand, and&#13;
growing rapidly, and with both ground and surface water supplies declining, failure to&#13;
complete the project would engender economic, social, and environmental calamity.&#13;
Projections using the Provincial Planning Model (PPM) show that if the project areas'&#13;
urban residents are to be given supplies equaling the norms for China and if farmers'&#13;
water allocations are to be preserved at current levels, industrial and mining activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
would decline rapidly and virtually cease after the year 2010. The annual loss in&#13;
industrial output would be Y 32 billion in 2000 and Y 66 billion in 2010. The impact&#13;
would be felt throughout China, given the heavy reliance on northern Shanxi's coal,&#13;
heavy industry and chemical output. Hundreds of thousands of skilled workers would&#13;
need to be relocated and vast quantities of mineral resources would go unexploited. It is&#13;
not surprising that Chinese planners have mentioned the possibility that Taiyuan and&#13;
Datong would need to relocated (at incalculable cost) if project water is not forthcoming.&#13;
E. ALTERNATIVES TO WANJIAZHAI AS WATER SOURCE&#13;
2.26  If economic growth in the project areas is to continue and the urban population is&#13;
to receive adequate supplies of water, additional sources of water must be found.&#13;
Potential sources include (a) groundwater, (b) local surface water, (c) imported surface&#13;
water, and (d) reallocation of existing water from other uses (irrigation).&#13;
2.27  Groundwater. In Datong and Taiyuan, there is strong evidence that groundwater&#13;
is already overexploited and has been since the late 1980s. The evidence comes from&#13;
both a comparison of extraction with estimates of sustainable yields and from&#13;
observations of declining water tables and increasing incidence of land subsidence. In&#13;
1993, groundwater overdraft in Datong was 40 percent higher than sustainable yield, and&#13;
in Taiyuan, 15 percent. Groundwater supplied 86.7 percent of total consumption in&#13;
Datong in that year, and 80.4 percent in Taiyuan. Except in the Shuozhou city center&#13;
area, groundwater extraction in the Pingshuo project area has not reached crisis levels.&#13;
This area has relied heavily on Shentou Spring, the average discharge rate of which had&#13;
dropped nearly 40 percent by 1993. The question is not whether increased extraction of&#13;
groundwater can be tolerated but whether current levels can be sustained to the year 2000&#13;
when the project water is scheduled to become available.&#13;
2.28  Local Surface Water. Taiyuan City is situated near the upper end of the Upper&#13;
Fen Basin, an enclosed hydrological entity that relies almost entirely on snowmelt and far&#13;
upper reach runoff for the river flow. There is negligible offtake above Taiyuan City and&#13;
its northern suburbs, but virtually unlimited demand for water in and around Taiyuan and&#13;
downstream for irrigation. The utilization rate has been as high as 74 percent in recent&#13;
years, which is probably the highest in the Yellow River Basin. This level cannot be&#13;
increased, given the seasonality of flows and high sediment content during flood periods.&#13;
This level of utilization has resulted in the riverbed often running dry much of the year,&#13;
and a dramatic decline in the irrigation supplies to downstream farmers. Furthermore,&#13;
there is strong evidence that recorded Fen river flows have been declining at statistically&#13;
significant rates. This has been caused by extensive terracing (to conserve water and&#13;
lessen erosion) upstream, and by the decline in groundwater tables, which increases&#13;
losses from seepage. Datong is located near the middle of the Sanganhe Basin, and&#13;
utilizes surface water from the Sanganhe River as well as small volumes from the Yuhe&#13;
River which originates in Nei Mongol Province. Sanganhe resources available to Datong&#13;
3&#13;
are again small relative to projected demands (36 million m at P75 vs. 352 million m&#13;
projected 2000 demand), and also are seen to be declining for the same reasons applying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
to the Upper Fen. In recent years, the Yuhe supplied about 74 percent of Datong's total&#13;
surface water, and the flow of this river is declining sharply as Nei Mongol develops uses&#13;
for the water for its own internal economic expansion. Downstream of Datong lies the&#13;
Cetian Reservoir which, by agreement, permits 31 million m3/year to be pumped back to&#13;
Datong. The remainder of Cetian's storage goes for consumption in Hebei and Beijing&#13;
City, which are also experiencing chronic water shortages.&#13;
2.29  Imported Surface Water. The alternative sources for importing surface water&#13;
are either from adjacent subbasins within Shanxi or from the Yellow River. Shanxi is&#13;
divided into 15 subbasins or catchment areas. Conceivably, Taiyuan could receive water&#13;
diverted from the Northwest or Hotuohe basins, and Pingshuo and Datong could receive&#13;
water from the Honghe and Yanghe basins, respectively. Two factors make these options&#13;
virtually impossible. First, water shortages are prevalent throughout northern Shanxi and&#13;
are intensifying everywhere. Only in the west are excess surface flows projected, and&#13;
these occur mostly in flood season, draining directly into the Yellow River, at points&#13;
remote from the project area water demand centers. Second, the division of Shanxi into&#13;
subbasins follows the pattern of intervening mountain ranges, which would need to be&#13;
crossed if water were to be diverted. These ranges are as high as 3,000 m and would&#13;
involve daunting technical and economic challenges.&#13;
2.30 The above discussion implies that only importation of water from the Yellow&#13;
River by a project such as the proposed Wanjiazhai can meet the projected water&#13;
demands. Alternatives cannot supply the volumes required, or would pose even greater&#13;
difficulties and higher costs than the proposed project. However, is Wanjiazhai the best&#13;
location on the Yellow River for the diversions? It is probably the only location that is&#13;
feasible. Above Wanjiazhai the Yellow River turns westward, requiring longer and more&#13;
costly diversion routes, and one that encroaches on Nei Mongol. Below Wanjiazhai, the&#13;
Loess Plateau begins with its associated runoff with high silt concentrations, which would&#13;
require prohibitively high treatment costs.&#13;
F. PROJECT PHASING&#13;
2.31   The economic and social effect of the water shortage situation is sufficiently&#13;
severe in each of the described project areas to warrant the immediate attention to&#13;
remedies such as the project. However, a project of the scope and cost of the full project&#13;
(para. 1.6) is not feasible given the limited financial means of the Province, and the&#13;
capacities of local contractors. Thus, the Project needs to be phased, beginning with the&#13;
General Transmission Line and either the North Line (to Datong and Pingshuo) or the&#13;
South (to Taiyuan and its environs). The second alternative has been selected for two&#13;
reasons. First, Taiyuan has a much larger urban population that would benefit from the&#13;
increased household water supplies, and a slightly greater industrial capacity suffering&#13;
from shortages than do the northern areas. Second, there is a much larger irrigation area&#13;
around and downstream from Taiyuan that could make immediate use of treated&#13;
wastewater to increase farm output and agricultural incomes. Thus Phase I of the project&#13;
will first serve Taiyuan beginning about 2001, followed by the northern areas in Phase II.&#13;
&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The project is part of a phased development program to expand the water supply&#13;
and improve the land and water environment in northern Shanxi province. Specific&#13;
objectives include:&#13;
(a)   Reducing the severe infrastructural bottlenecks in water supply that&#13;
impede economic growth;&#13;
(b)   Increasing employment and incomes by eliminating the paramount&#13;
constraint to development;&#13;
(c)   Reducing the distress of the urban population caused by insufficient and&#13;
intermittent water supplies, which are barely enough to meet their basic&#13;
needs;&#13;
(d)   Improving the environment by ending the overextraction of groundwater&#13;
and the subsequent drying of surface streams and land subsidence, and by&#13;
treating all waste, so as to reduce water pollution downstream;&#13;
(e)   Creating a system to rationalize water use, by sector, and reducing water&#13;
shortages by managing demand; and&#13;
(f)   Promoting integrated management and financial independence for water&#13;
institutions.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2   The project would provide the physical works needed to transfer water from the&#13;
Yellow River through a system of tunnels, aqueduct pipelines and reservoirs. It would&#13;
also support policy and institutional reform for economic water pricing and water&#13;
marketing. The project would include the following components:&#13;
(a)   Yellow River Diversion Project Corporation (YRDPC)&#13;
(i)    Work on the general main tunnel (GMT) would be completed. This&#13;
would involve civil works for tunnels no. 1 to 3, 6 to 11, and all&#13;
connecting structures such as aqueducts and siphons, power&#13;
transmission lines (220 kV, 110 kV, 35 kV) and transformer stations&#13;
as well as preparatory work for access roads, adits and water supply&#13;
for the south main tunnels (SMT);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
(ii)    Civil works for five pumping stations (two underground and three&#13;
above ground) and for pressure tunnels no. 4 and 5 for the GMT;&#13;
(iii)    Construction of all seven tunnels (totaling 98 km), four aqueducts&#13;
and the bifurcation structure for the SMT;&#13;
(iv)    Supply and installation of equipment for all pumping stations on the&#13;
GMT and SMT. The supply would include all pumps (6.0-6.45&#13;
m3/second units), motors (10 MW to 12 MW units), controls for the&#13;
motors, communications, valves, gates and steel works;&#13;
(v)    Construction of connecting works from the end of the SMT to&#13;
Taiyuan that will include a headworks at Fen-1, a 41 km twin&#13;
pipeline (2.2-2.4 m diameter each) and a 17.1 km tunnel to the&#13;
Huyang treatment plant outside of Taiyuan;&#13;
(vi)    Resettlement/compensation  for all people displaced  by  the&#13;
aqueducts;&#13;
(vii)   Environmental management techniques to offset the negative effects&#13;
at the construction sites or from any part of the project;&#13;
(viii)    Consultant services to supervise construction, create a board to&#13;
review disputes, establish a panel of experts for the design and&#13;
construction of underground works and training programs, and&#13;
organize an environment/resettlement panel.&#13;
(b)   Water Resources Institutional Reform&#13;
(i)    Reform of all major water resource institutions will be undertaken&#13;
within the Yellow River water delivery area: YRDPC, Fen-1, Fen-2,&#13;
Fenhe Irrigation Bureau, Taiyuan Water Company and Taiyuan&#13;
Sewerage Bureau. The YRDPC, Fen-1, Fen-2, Fenhe Irrigation&#13;
Bureau and the Taiyuan Groundwater Institution and Rural&#13;
Groundwater Institution will be integrated into a Upper Fen River&#13;
Basin Corporation (UFRBC). This corporation will be responsible&#13;
to license all water sold (surface or groundwater) to all users in the&#13;
Upper Fen Basin. UFRBC will issue permits for the sale of water&#13;
and discharge of water and waste water. To ensure financial&#13;
autonomy, water pricing would be liberalized to obtain the best&#13;
arrangements within the various sectors, and trading between&#13;
sectors. The Taiyuan City, the Fen Bureau Irrigators, Gujao City,&#13;
and industries will form the users of water and UFRBC will issue&#13;
permits for use for different sources of water. Prices will be based&#13;
on the quality of water, time when water is needed, the return flows&#13;
and the quality of return flows. The users of the water, Taiyuan City&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
Water Company, Sewerage Company, and Irrigators will also be&#13;
reformed so that they will also be financially autonomous.&#13;
(c)   Water Pollution Control and Industrial Waste Management&#13;
(i)    An environmental master plan for Taiyuan, which would involve&#13;
studies on a wastewater permit system, pollution enforcement, and a&#13;
phased pollution prevention program;&#13;
(ii)    An in-plant wastewater monitoring system and effective pollution&#13;
permit system, with charges high enough to deter industries from&#13;
discharging waste above the standards;&#13;
(iii)    Training and upgrading Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB)&#13;
staff skills to prevent pollution, establish and operate pollution&#13;
permit systems and a data base for monitoring water and wastewater&#13;
quality;&#13;
(iv)    A fund to introduce cleaner technology in the seven main polluting&#13;
industries (steel, coal, coke, pharmaceuticals, paper, fertilizer and&#13;
chemicals).&#13;
3.3   Complementary works for Taiyuan would be needed for receiving, treating and&#13;
distributing water; they will be carried out by the Taiyuan Municipal Water Company&#13;
(TMWC). These works are not under the project but will be implemented in parallel by&#13;
TMWC. Also, the city will need to make added investments to ensure that wastewater&#13;
generated from the increased water supply will be intercepted, collected and treated. This&#13;
will prevent water quality in the Fen River from deteriorating as it passes through the area.&#13;
The works that will be financed by a combination of local and Japanese Government&#13;
sources (para. 3.41) will involve the following components:&#13;
(a)   Water supply for Taiyuan&#13;
(i)    A new surface water treatment plant at Huyang with an initial&#13;
capacity of 0.9 million m3 per day in 2003, to be increased to 1.4&#13;
million m3 per day by 2005 and to 1.76 million m3 per day by 2010;&#13;
(ii)    A new network of water transmission lines of 170 km for the City,&#13;
with pipe diameters of 300 to 2,000 mm and a special water line of&#13;
13 km for the power station;&#13;
(iii)    Two booster stations;&#13;
(iv)    Consultant services for detailed design and engineering;&#13;
(v)    Training for water company staff in finance, operations and&#13;
maintenance management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(b)   Wastewater Collection and Treatment&#13;
(i)   Eight new wastewater treatment plants for eight new areas (Hexi,&#13;
Xiaodian, Xishan, and Shanglan, Luocheng, Nanxiawen, Jinei and&#13;
Power Plant No. 1);&#13;
(ii)    Rehabilitating five existing wastewater treatment plants (Yang Jiabu,&#13;
Ying Jiabu, Beijiao, Zhaozhuang, and Nanyan);&#13;
(iii)   Laying the first phase of 170 km of interceptors and secondary and&#13;
tertiary sewers by 2002 (ultimately 660 km);&#13;
(iv)    Consultant services for master plan and feasibility studies and first-&#13;
phase design;&#13;
(v)    Training for municipal commission staff and for institutional&#13;
development (to integrate wastewater collection and treatment).&#13;
C. PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
3.4   Project impact would be monitored with respect to the project objectives (POs),&#13;
the key indicators of which are listed below:&#13;
(a)   For PO(a), it is planned to monitor the economic output of different&#13;
sectors of industry and water deliveries;&#13;
(b)   For PO(b), employment growth and income will be monitored;&#13;
(c)   For PO(c), it is planned to monitor the water deliveries to households;&#13;
(d)   For PO(d), it is planned to monitor the water supplied from groundwater to&#13;
all sectors, to observe whether these exceed the safe yield levels of&#13;
extraction and to monitor the water quality in the Fen River and tributaries&#13;
around and below the city limits;&#13;
(e)   For PO(e), it is planned to monitor the industrial and urban water&#13;
deliveries to each sector and their economic outputs and employment; and&#13;
(f)   For PO(f), it is planned to monitor the progress of pricing reform and the&#13;
corporatization of water suppliers in the Upper Fen River Basin and their&#13;
integration into the Upper Fen River Basin Corporation.&#13;
D. PROJECT FORMULATION&#13;
3.5   The Wanjiazhai Dam, identified in the Yellow River Master Plan as the most&#13;
economic site, would be the main diversion point from the Yellow River. The dam is not&#13;
under the project, but is being constructed by MWR. It is located below the bend&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
southward (after Hekouzen) where the catchment area is 394,813 km2 (52 percent of the&#13;
river basin) and river flows average about 19.7 billion m 3/year. The lowest flow recorded&#13;
at this point was 11 billion m3/year in 1928. Since the diversion requires only 1.2 billion&#13;
m3/year, there will always be sufficient water for this purpose.&#13;
3.6   The dam, of the concrete gravity type, is designed to preserve the long-term&#13;
storage of 445 million m3 of water, which will be drawn through two side sluices to the&#13;
pumping stations at an elevation of 948 m. The reservoir's normal operating level will be&#13;
977 m; its lowest level, 952 m, occurs during silt flushing. The intake sluice sills for the&#13;
tunnels skim the water from the reservoir's upper section so that suspended sediment is&#13;
minimized and concentration levels are kept to relatively low levels of 1 to 1.3 kg/m3. In&#13;
winter, intake sills would be heated to prevent ice from closing the intake. Pumping from&#13;
the reservoir would occur only from October to July, because suspended silt&#13;
concentrations can exceed 5 kg/m3 in August and September. Safety aspects of the design&#13;
were reviewed by consultants appointed by MWR and additional specialists were&#13;
appointed to review these aspects during design and construction. MWR has also&#13;
installed exterior and interior equipment on the dam to monitor any movements or&#13;
deflections in the dam. At negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the Borrower that&#13;
it will prepare, by December 31, 1998, a satisfactory maintenance program and an&#13;
emergency preparedness plan for the dam. Also, the Borrower will employ independent&#13;
experts with qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to&#13;
inspect the dam, associated works and structures regularly starting October 31, 1998,&#13;
according to sound engineering practices, to determine if any of the structural conditions,&#13;
maintenance or operating methods could endanger safety (see Annex 17). Inspections&#13;
would be conducted annually for the first five years of operations and every three years&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
3.7    MWR, through the Tianjin Design Institute, developed a detailed environmental&#13;
impact assessment (EIA) for the dam and program for resettlement. The EIA covered&#13;
subjects such as water temperature and quality, reservoir sedimentation, ice regimes and&#13;
floods, reservoir regulation, environmental geology, fisheries, impacts of construction&#13;
sites, protection measures around resettlement areas and the environmental monitoring&#13;
system.   It indicated that dam  construction should not cause any  significant&#13;
environmental degradation, provided the dam is operated as planned, which would&#13;
include incorporating the Environmental Management Plans specified in the EIA, and&#13;
provisions for resettlement. Also, it concluded that resettlement is the project's only&#13;
major negative impact, which will be completely offset by the ongoing resettlement plan.&#13;
Altogether, 664 residents are affected at the dam site and 6,047 in the reservoir area. All&#13;
664 at the dam site have been resettled, the new areas developed and industries opened to&#13;
ensure that the income of those resettled is maintained. In fact, surveys indicate that most&#13;
incomes have increased by 35 percent. As for the 6,047 residents in the reservoir area,&#13;
the investment planned totals Y 510 million, or about Y 84,000/person, which far exceeds&#13;
any previous resettlement expenditures in China. Nevertheless, during negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained that the Borrower will (a) complete the resettlement for the&#13;
Wanjiazhai Dam according to a resettlement action plan that has been found acceptable to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
the Bank, (b) employ by February 15, 1998 an independent monitoring institution with&#13;
qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to evaluate&#13;
semiannually the socioeconomic progress of those resettled from the dam site; and&#13;
(c) provide the Bank with a report of each evaluation along with proposals for meeting the&#13;
resettlement plan targets, if they have not been achieved. It is planned that the monitoring&#13;
institution will be the Yellow River Conservancy Commission Resettlement Office.&#13;
3.8   MWR is in charge of project implementation. Dam construction began in March&#13;
1994 and the river was closed in November 1995. The first turbine should be installed in&#13;
November 1998 and the dam completed sufficiently to start diverting water from the&#13;
Yellow River.&#13;
3.9   Alignment and Routing. The issues of tunnel alignment and routing the water&#13;
were studied for three decades. The tunnel and water route are shown in Map IBRD&#13;
28136, and a schematic is shown in Figure 1, Annex 1. The route was selected based on&#13;
the geology that provides the strongest rock relatively free of groundwater, the shortest&#13;
distance for the transfer, the lowest cost and pumping requirements. Based on these&#13;
criteria, the best alignment for the general main tunnel (GMT) moves eastward from the&#13;
Wanjiazhai Dam from an elevation of 957 m, through a mountain range at 1,582 m, and&#13;
follows the Pinguan River, which flows west, for about 44 km to Xiatuzhai Village,&#13;
where the bifurcation structure is located for the north main tunnel (NMT) and south&#13;
main tunnel (SMT). The alignment for the SMT starts from Xiatuzhai and passes through&#13;
the Guancen Mountain (2,800 m high) to the Luya Shan Range, for 102 km into the Fen&#13;
River Basin. This is the shortest route to the Fen River. From the connection tunnel to&#13;
the Fen, the water travels via the upper Fen for 66 km and enters an existing reservoir,&#13;
Fen-1. Here the water is transported by way of twin pipelines for 40.2 km and tunnels for&#13;
16.8 km. The route was selected because it offered the lowest-cost construction, least&#13;
possibility of pollution, lowest loss of water and minimal environmental impact.&#13;
3.10  Five pumping stations would move water through these tunnels: three are on the&#13;
GMT and two on the SMT. Four have pump lifts of 142 m and one is 80 m. These lifts&#13;
were designed to reduce tangential velocities in the impellers so that sand erosion will be&#13;
reduced. The station locations were also chosen to maximize pumping efficiency.&#13;
3.11  The GMT is in competent mass limestone and dolomite (rock class 1-3) most of&#13;
the way (81 percent); only small sections, in the tunnel openings, are in shale, sandstone&#13;
and soils. The SMT is also mainly (88 percent) in competent dolomites and limestone&#13;
(rock class 1-3) and some small sections are in soils, red clays, sandstone and coal. Most&#13;
of the tunnel construction will be by tunnel boring machine (TBM) with double shields.&#13;
The tunnel lining will be placed automatically by the TBM. The lining will be precast&#13;
reinforced concrete segments made on-site in a segment production factory. Use of&#13;
TBMs for construction for long tunnels has been found to be very economical and give&#13;
good construction quality. Construction in the less-competent rock would be undertaken&#13;
manually, with drill and blast (D/B) techniques. The alignment of both tunnels was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
optimized to ensure that geological conditions will be good and construction can be fully&#13;
mechanized, thus achieving high quality at low cost.&#13;
3.12  Reservoirs. The water transfer system has two main regulating reservoirs. The&#13;
Shentongshui Reservoir, with a capacity 150,000 m3, is located between the GMT's&#13;
tunnels 5 and 6. It will regulate the inflow of water from the Wanjiazhai Reservoir and&#13;
also regulate water flowing out to the rest of the tunnels in the GMT. The reservoir will&#13;
be the main dynamic regulator in the entire GMT and SMT tunnel system. Additional&#13;
dynamic regulation will be achieved through variable speed motors in the pumping&#13;
stations. The only other reservoir will be the Fen-1, located in the Fen Basin about 57 km&#13;
from Taiyuan. The Fen Dam was built in the 1960s with a capacity of 700 million m3&#13;
3                                      3&#13;
and an active storage of 385 million m . The reservoir will provide 120 million m&#13;
storage for the period when pumping is not possible from the Wanjiazhai Reservoir&#13;
(because of suspended silt loads of over 5 kg/m3). (See Annex 1, Figure 1.1.)&#13;
3.13  At negotiations, assurances were obtained from Shanxi Province that it will&#13;
continue its program of dam maintenance for Fen-] dam; also that the Province and&#13;
independent experts with qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to the&#13;
Bank would, not later than February 15, 1998, inspect the dam-associated works and&#13;
structures, according to sound engineering practices. This would be done to determine if&#13;
any of the structures, maintenance or operating methods are deficient and may compromise&#13;
their safety. Shanxi will biannually submit the experts' reports to the Bank starting with&#13;
the first report by November 15, 1998.&#13;
E. PROJECT WORKS&#13;
3.14 General Main Tunnel. The GMT has 11 tunnels, five aqueducts, three pumping&#13;
stations (GM1, GM2 and GM3), and one underground regulating reservoir. The tunnels&#13;
and aqueducts are designed for a flow capacity of 48 m3/second and to pump 1,200&#13;
million m3/year of water to Datong, Pingshuo and Taiyuan. The first phase of the project&#13;
will have a capacity to pump 640 million m3/year (25.8 m3/second) to Taiyuan; and,&#13;
although the tunnels and aqueducts will be completed at this capacity, the pump stations&#13;
will initially have a reduced number of units (because of lower demand in 2002) to pump&#13;
320 million m3/year (12.5 m3/second), reaching 640 million m3/year by 2010.&#13;
3.15  Tunnels 1 to 5 are pressurized while all others are free-flowing. Tunnels 1 to 8&#13;
are circular, with cross-sections of 5.6 m for tunnels 3 to 5, and 5.46 m for tunnels 6 to 8.&#13;
Tunnels 9 to 11 have a city-gate shape, 5.0 m wide and 5.36 m high. The 11 tunnels vary&#13;
in length: tunnels 8 and 11 are 10 to 12 km, tunnels 6 and 9 are 6 to 7.5 km, and tunnels&#13;
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 vary from 0.21 km to 2.67 km. The five aqueducts connect the tunnels.&#13;
3.16  The Shentongshui Reservoir is located after the two pump stations, between&#13;
tunnels 5 and 6. Situated at the end of tunnel 5 and at the start of tunnel 6, it is an&#13;
underground cavern 12 m wide by 6 m high and 2,900 m long and has storage of&#13;
151,000 m3 and control gates to regulate the flows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.17  There are two underground pumping stations to pump water from the Wanjiazhai&#13;
Reservoir. Pump station 1 is located between tunnels 3 and 4 and pump station 2 is&#13;
located between tunnels 4 and 5. Each of the pump stations will be designed to have an&#13;
ultimate pumping capacity of 10 units of 6.45 m3/second for each unit. The static lift for&#13;
each unit will be 142 m head. Each chamber will be excavated some 130 m long, 18 m&#13;
wide and 35 m high. A third pumping station is located between tunnels 10 and 11 and&#13;
will be above ground. This pump station will also have 10 pumps of 6.45 m3/second.&#13;
3.18  Preparatory work for GMT consists of construction of access roads (105 km),&#13;
power supply (220 kV and 110 kV lines), a communications system, and access adits for&#13;
all tunnels. Most of this work has been completed. In addition, to get an early start,&#13;
YRDPC awarded tunnels 6, 7, and 8 to an international contractor in 1994. Similarly,&#13;
contracts for tunnels 1, 2, 9, 10, and 11 were already awarded to national contractors that&#13;
were selected through national competitive procedures. Bank missions have reviewed&#13;
these works, which are being funded by YRDPC, and the quality of design and&#13;
construction is satisfactory. Bank funding for the GMT will focus on tunnels 3, 4, and 5&#13;
and the pumping stations.&#13;
3.19 South Main Line. The SMT consists of seven free-flow tunnels (98 kin), two&#13;
buried pipes, two aqueducts, three culverts and two pumping stations. The discharge&#13;
capacity of these facilities is 25.8 m3/second. Tunnels 1 to 3 will have a horseshoe-&#13;
shaped cross-section, with a top diameter of 4.24 m, an invert width also of 4.24 m, and&#13;
water depth will be 3.08 m. As tunnels 4 to 7 will be constructed with boring machines&#13;
(TBM), the tunnels' shape will be circular with a diameter of 4.2 m. Tunnel lengths, as&#13;
indicated in Table 3.1, particularly for tunnels 5 (26.4 km) and 7 (42.6 km), are among&#13;
the longest in the world.&#13;
TABLE3.1: TUNNELLENGTHS&#13;

3.20  The SMT will have two pumping stations at ground level, 81.3 m long, 15.4 m&#13;
wide and 27.7 m high. Pumping station 1 is located between tunnels 1 and 2 and&#13;
pumping station 2 is located between tunnels 2 and 3. Each will have six units of pumps&#13;
with a unit capacity of 6.45 m3/second and lift capacity of 142 m.&#13;
3.21  Connecting Works. The connecting works link Taiyuan's main water treatment&#13;
plant to the Fen-1 reservoir, a distance of about 57 km. The works consist of an intake&#13;
tower in the reservoir and a pipeline that follows the Fen riverbed most of the way to the&#13;
city. The dam was constructed in 1961 for flood control, irrigation and water supply; it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
has been upgraded several times with new outlet tunnels to sluice silt through and&#13;
stabilize the active storage. Dam safety inspections have also been carried out by the&#13;
Shanxi Water Conservancy Bureau.&#13;
3.22  The pipelines are six twin lengths, for a total of 40.2 km, and seven tunnel&#13;
sections of 16.7 km. The pipe-lengths vary from 10.8 km to 0.11 km and the diameters&#13;
are 2.2 m to 2.5 m. The seven tunnels vary from 0.1 km to 13.122 km and the diameters&#13;
vary from 2.2 m to 2.5 m. Prefabricated reinforced concrete pipes will be used, as they&#13;
can withstand a pressure of 10 bars at the joints. The pipeline will have 7 valve&#13;
chambers, 76 inspection wells, 134 ventilation air valves, 6 pressure reduction valves, 2&#13;
energy dissipation pools, 17 regulator valves and 2 butterfly valves. The tunnels will be&#13;
constructed using drill and blast techniques. (See Annex 1, Figures 1.2 and 1.3.)&#13;
3.23  Plant and Equipment. The main equipment to be procured will be pumps,&#13;
motors, controls and communications items. The required flow between 2001 to 2010 is&#13;
12.9 m3/second and after 2010, it will be 25.9 m3/second. For the first stage (in 2001),&#13;
there will be 15 units of vertical centrifugal pumps (three pumps per station). Each&#13;
pump's unit capacity will be 6.45 m3/second, with a static lift capacity of 142 m. Pump&#13;
power of 10.8 MW will be used for the first two pumping stations on the GMT and two&#13;
stations on the SMT (a total of 12 units). For the third pumping station, unit capacity will&#13;
be 6.45 m3/second, but the static lift capacity will be 80 m and the pump power will be&#13;
6.3 MW. The pump inlet, guide vanes and outlet areas will be coated with special&#13;
hardened materials and impellers will be made of hardened steel to resist sand erosion.&#13;
Fifteen synchronous vertical shaft electric motors will be procured: three units with a&#13;
capacity of 6.75 MW and 12 units with a rated capacity of 12.5 MW. Except for the&#13;
GMT's, the first two stations, which will use fixed-speed motors (six units), all other&#13;
motors will be variable-speed drives (nine units). The starting facilities for the fixed-&#13;
speed motor units will be variable-frequency starters (6 units) and for the variable-speed&#13;
motors will be variable-speed converters (9 units).&#13;
3.24  Control Systems. One central dispatching and control station and 13 local&#13;
control stations will be built to coordinate and integrate the operations of the entire&#13;
diversion system and to enhance reliability and safety. Control and automation systems&#13;
will be procured for flow control, economic flow dispatching, normal starting and&#13;
stopping, automatic operation and coordination for emergency events, and operation&#13;
monitoring. Of the three levels of controls, the first level is at the local pump unit and the&#13;
control consists of starting and stopping a pump unit, automatic actions in the event of an&#13;
emergency and data collection for levels two and three. The second level is at the pump&#13;
station for managing pump units, gate and valve control. At this level, data will be&#13;
collected to be transmitted to level three and information will be displayed at local&#13;
centers; there will also be some remote control functions. A third level will have a&#13;
supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA). It will manage by remote&#13;
control the whole hydraulic network and equipment, and emergency shutdown of pumps.&#13;
There will also be global monitoring of all equipment and storage of all historical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
information. In addition, there will be programs to control operations of all pumps and&#13;
motors to maximize the system's efficiency.&#13;
3.25  Water Sector Institutional Reform.  This component affects several water&#13;
resource institutions in the area where water from the Yellow River will be transferred&#13;
under one corporation, the Upper Fen River Basin Corporation (UFRBC) for the supply&#13;
of water. The users of water will be the cities, industries, irrigators, etc. The users will&#13;
be issued permits to use water by UFRBC.&#13;
3.26 These institutions include YRDPC, the Fen River Dam I Bureau, Fen River Dam&#13;
II Bureau, and Fen River Irrigation Bureau. UFRBC will be responsible for all water&#13;
permits (surface or groundwater). Also, water user charges are so low that the institutions&#13;
receive subsidies, and are not financially autonomous.&#13;
3.27  The reform will have two phases. In the first (from 1997 to 2000) all suppliers of&#13;
water, YRDPC, Fen-1, Fen-2, Groundwater Institutions, Fen Irrigation Bureau, will be&#13;
corporatized and made financially independent from the Government. The irrigation&#13;
districts at the village level will be turned over to farmers who will run the systems&#13;
themselves. The water resources management institutions at the town, county and district&#13;
levels will be corporatized, converted to financially autonomous units, and would derive&#13;
all their revenues from user charges. In addition, water prices (see para. 5.18 and Table&#13;
5.1) will be at levels to reflect the economic value of water. Also, the allocation of water&#13;
resources will ensure that industrial and urban sectors are provided with enough water,&#13;
although there will be a basic allocation of water for agriculture and human consumption.&#13;
Last, water trading within and outside of sectors will be allowed to achieve more rational&#13;
use.&#13;
3.28  In the second phase, all six water agencies will be placed under one corporation or&#13;
holding company to better manage the resource. A more detailed description is given in&#13;
Annex 1 1.&#13;
3.29  The regulatory body, the Wanjiazhai Water Management Committee, will&#13;
coordinate management activities of the corporatized entities mentioned above. This&#13;
body will regulate water allocation and future price adjustments and thus ensure&#13;
consistency of water prices across sectors and sources, monitor surface and groundwater,&#13;
and coordinate and approve water trading.&#13;
3.30  The reform will be carried out by three institutions: the Shanxi Commission for&#13;
Structural Reform (SCSR), the Water Conservancy Department (SWCD) and Bureau for&#13;
Price Administration (SBPA).&#13;
3.31  Technical assistance of $10.1 million (including contingencies) will be provided&#13;
under the project to help carry out the work and will be applied as follows: $2.5 million&#13;
for consultants including $200,000 for promoting community participation, $0.7 million&#13;
for training, $2.6 million to establish a water resources monitoring system, and $4.3&#13;
million for equipment and vehicles (see Annex 2, page 99).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
3.32  Water Pollution Control and Industrial Waste Management. The project also&#13;
provides for investments in water pollution control and industrial waste management.&#13;
The Taiyuan and Shanxi Province EPBs will be strengthened, conduct studies and&#13;
implement programs to improve pollution control and maintain water quality in the Fen&#13;
River and other receiving waters at acceptable levels. These initiatives will include:&#13;
(a)   An environmental master plan for Taiyuan, which involves a wastewater&#13;
management master plan to further develop the discharge pernit system&#13;
and related pollution prevention programs;&#13;
(b)   In-plant wastewater monitoring and enforcement systems, with effective&#13;
charges and penalties;&#13;
(c)   Training for EPB staff; and&#13;
(d)   A subloan facility of $8.0 million to implement cleaner technologies in the&#13;
main polluting industries.&#13;
3.33  The purpose of the subloan facility is for financing industrial enterprises in&#13;
Taiyuan City to adopt Clean Technologies to reduce and control their pollution to protect&#13;
and improve the Fen River water quality and the environment of Taiyuan. The local&#13;
counterpart fund will come mainly from the special environment protection investment&#13;
from Shanxi Provincial and Taiyuan City Govermments as well as from enterprises' self-&#13;
raised fund. To effectively manage the subloan facility, Taiyuan will establish a special&#13;
body, the Subloan Administration Technical Committee (SATC), and an executive&#13;
agency, the Subloan Management Office (SMO), which are patterned after the experience&#13;
of Tianjin, which also has a major industrial center with problems of waste management&#13;
similar to these at Taiyuan. SATC is in charge of subloan management, which comprises&#13;
representatives of concerned government agencies including TEPB, Taiyuan Planning&#13;
Commission, and Taiyuan Finance Bureau with TEPB at leading position. The major&#13;
duties for SATC include: (a) preparing directives and regulations for subloan use;&#13;
(b) setting up subloan approval conditions; (c) setting up the SMO; (d) approving the&#13;
SMO annual work plan; (e) approving subloan projects; and (f) reviewing the SMO&#13;
annual report.&#13;
3.34  Subloan Operation Procedure. Initial proposals are to be made by candidate&#13;
enterprises and submitted to responsible government agencies for review and permission.&#13;
Then, formal proposals are submitted to the SMO for appraisal with the criteria discussed&#13;
below.&#13;
3.35  Procedures for Processing Subloans. TEPB with the use of local consultants&#13;
will be responsible for processing the subloans. The enterprises will prepare an initial&#13;
feasibility that will be reviewed in detail by TEPB using its own consultants. TEPB will&#13;
appraise the proposals and submit the appraisal to the SMO for final approval. Prior&#13;
Bank review will only be needed for the first three subprojects and subsequent&#13;
subprojects for which subloans of over $1.0 million or more are proposed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
3.36  Subborrower Eligibility Criteria. The subborrower must be in the following&#13;
types of industries: steel, chemicals including fertilizer, paper mills or pharmaceuticals.&#13;
Under the circumstances, a loan will be made available under a first come/first serve basis&#13;
to industry who could meet the following criteria and subproject eligibility criteria: (a) is&#13;
a limited liability (shareholding) company or otherwise established as a legal entity;&#13;
(b) has a completed EIA approved by the TEPB and has a mitigation plan satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank; (c) has adopted the new accounting standards and its financial statements have&#13;
been audited by independent auditors; and (d) the company has been appraised and found&#13;
creditworthy (see Annex 15).&#13;
3.37  Terms of the Subloan. The subloan terms will be as follows:&#13;
* Interest Rate and Fees. Subborrowers will pay a commitment fee of 0.75 percent&#13;
on the undisbursed amount of the subloan. The minimum interest margin will be&#13;
2 percent over the Bank interest rate but could vary depending on the cost of&#13;
undertaking the required appraisal and loan processing, administrative overheads&#13;
for the SMO and repayment risk.&#13;
*  Maturity. The maturity of individual subloans will be no more than three years'&#13;
grace and eight years' repayment period.&#13;
*  Rate of Return. Each subproject financed will have a financial rate and an&#13;
economic rate of return of no less than  1I percent.&#13;
3.38  The maximum size of a loan cannot exceed $1.5 million. The proceeds of the&#13;
subloan are mainly for pollution control equipment and services and must not cover the&#13;
costs of civil works, taxes, or land.&#13;
3.39  During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom Shanxi that it will establish&#13;
through Taiyuan an SMO with terms of reference, staffing and other resources&#13;
acceptable to the Bank by December 31, 1997 to appraise subprojects, provide subloans&#13;
and supervise, monitor, and report on subprojects in accordance with an operations&#13;
manual's procedures and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Appraisal&#13;
procedures will focus on (a) an analysis of the viability of the enterprise undertaking the&#13;
project; (b) an evaluation of the subproject's EIA's mitigation plan; (c) an evaluation of&#13;
procurement arrangements; and (d) an assessment of the enterprise's ability to pay back&#13;
the loan.&#13;
F. COMPLEMENTARY WORKS&#13;
3.40  Complementary investments and activities described in detail in para. 3.3 will be&#13;
needed to efficiently and economically use some 640 million m 3/year of additional raw&#13;
water from the Yellow River to the Fen River (for the use of Taiyuan and surrounding&#13;
areas). These complementary works will be planned, financed and implemented by&#13;
Taiyuan and the Province over the next 25 years. The investments will double Taiyuan's&#13;
available water resources by 2001, triple them by 2020, and support sustained economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
growth and higher living standards over the whole region.  The relevant sector&#13;
institutions responsible for implementing them and, operating and maintaining services&#13;
are being reformed and expanded to accomplish the tasks.&#13;
3.41  Costs and Financing of Complementary Works. The estimated cost of the&#13;
water supply component is about Y 3.2 billion and of the wastewater component, Y 3.0&#13;
billion. These works will be financed from self-generated funds, including increased&#13;
water and wastewater charges, other provincial sources (Y 0.9 billion), and from bilateral&#13;
loans. Bilateral and multilateral sources have tentatively earmarked a loan to cover up to&#13;
70 percent (Y 1.8 billion) of the cost of the water supply component. It is also expected&#13;
to finance about Y 750 million of the wastewater component.  Taiyuan industrial&#13;
enterprises are expected to contribute about Y 765 million.&#13;
3.42  Implementation Schedule. Most of these works are scheduled to be completed&#13;
concurrently with the additional project water coming onstream. The Huyan Treatment&#13;
Plant, with a capacity of 1.0 million m3/day, and the replacement of about 170 km of&#13;
undersized and aging transmission lines and the installation of new lines will be&#13;
completed by 2002.  Rehabilitation of the five sewage treatment works and the&#13;
completion of the first phase of the sewer program (interceptors, secondary and tertiary&#13;
sewers) to provide about 0.6 to 0.7 million m3/day of wastewater collection and treatment&#13;
capacity, is also scheduled for completion by 2003. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtained from Shanxi that all proposed complementary works for Taiyuan water&#13;
supply and wastewater collection and treatment and associated resettlement activities&#13;
would be implemented as planned in a program acceptable to the Bank so as to be&#13;
completed by June 30, 2002. Shanxi will provide the Bank on a semiannual basis (by&#13;
each April 15 and October 15) details of the designs, financing and construction progress&#13;
for Taiyuan water supply and sewerage plans implemented in the preceding semester and&#13;
plans for construction for the 12 months ahead.&#13;
G. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.43  A detailed EIA was carried out by the China Institute of Radiation Protection&#13;
(CIRP) and the Shanxi University Environmental Engineering Department, with help&#13;
from foreign consultants. It was reviewed and endorsed by the National Environmental&#13;
Protection Agency of China (NEPA). Based on the Bank review and recommendations&#13;
during project preparation (November 1995 and May 1996), the reports were improved&#13;
and the EIA was submitted to the Bank in July 1996. CIRP prepared an English&#13;
summary of the report, which will be circulated to the Board on October 12, 1996.&#13;
3.44  The EIA reviewed the need for water in the Taiyuan area; the availability of water&#13;
for diversion (Annex 16); impacts along the delivery system (resettlement, assurance of&#13;
continued delivery, maintenance of water quality, disposal of tunnel excavations and&#13;
siltation problems); use of imported water and water pollution. It also specified needs for&#13;
overall environmental monitoring, an environmental management plan (EMP) and&#13;
training needs (see Annex 5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
3.45  The studies indicated the project had overwhelming positive affects because it&#13;
would address the scarcity of water.  At present, average urban household gross&#13;
consumption is 45 liters/capita/day, which is 41 percent of China's average, and 29&#13;
percent of the world average. Industrial water use is limited to 60 percent of demand and&#13;
recycling has reached the limits of technology. The present daily shortfall is about&#13;
400,000 m3/day, of which about 200,000 m /day are supplied by overextracting&#13;
groundwater. This has caused the groundwater to drop to over 100 m in many places and&#13;
very severe land subsidence in the city of up to 3 m. The groundwater depletion has also&#13;
caused several local streams in the Fen River Basin to dry up.&#13;
3.46  Hence, any measures to introduce water from the Yellow River will help to reduce&#13;
the human distress and improve living conditions in the city. In addition, reducing the&#13;
use of groundwater will halt land subsidence and improve the flows in small streams.&#13;
3.47  The EIA identified several potential impacts, of which only two have significant&#13;
potential negative impacts if not properly managed: (a) resettlement of a small number of&#13;
people and (b) the increased wastewater generated from the introduction of large volumes&#13;
of water to the city. However, with the proposed control measures, the net impacts for&#13;
both situations will be positive.&#13;
3.48  In addition, although most of the project works will be underground, they will&#13;
affect some surface areas due to land acquisition for tunnel crossings in river valleys and&#13;
for earth spoil disposal (from tunnel excavation) and health hazards to workers on&#13;
construction sites. The health hazards to workers and disposal of tunnel spoil can be&#13;
offset by straightforward control measures available in China and these will be applied in&#13;
the project. Because 1,204 individuals will be affected by land acquisition, a resettlement&#13;
plan was prepared in accordance to OD 4.3 (see paras. 3.50-3.57), to offset negative&#13;
impacts.&#13;
3.49  To ameliorate the wastewater problem, a detailed wastewater treatment and&#13;
management plan was developed and funding sources identified; as a result, by 2002 (one&#13;
year after water arrives in Taiyuan), 89 percent (42 percent in STW's and 37 percent in&#13;
lagoons) of the wastewater will be treated and by 2010, 100 percent (74 percent in STW's&#13;
and 26 percent in lagoons). In addition, a Water Pollution Control and Industrial Waste&#13;
Management Program was incorporated into the project [see paras. 3.2(c) and 3.3]; by&#13;
2002, the water quality of the Fen River in Taiyuan will be improved from class V to&#13;
class IV, and by 2010, to class IV. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that&#13;
YRDPC will employ by September 15, 1997 an independent environment/resettlement&#13;
panel of experts to review and make recommendations with respect to the EMP. Further,&#13;
it shall maintain an Environmental Management Office with competent staff in adequate&#13;
numbers and with responsibilities and functions acceptable to the Bank to manage,&#13;
coordinate and monitor the EMP. Also, it shall ensure that all activities under the&#13;
project will comply with the EMP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

H. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
3.50  Project Impacts. The project entails acquisition of land and the resettlement of&#13;
those affected. YRDPC conducted a detailed census, with the help of counties, towns and&#13;
villages; based on the results, acquisitions will involve 7,393 mu (440 ha) of permanently&#13;
held agricultural land, 2,495 mu (166 ha) of temporarily leased agricultural land, and 23&#13;
small enterprises. It will also involve the resettlement of 54 individuals in 16 households.&#13;
About 1,204 persons will lose land, the 16 households have lost their dwellings, and 273&#13;
employees will be affected due to the relocation of their enterprises. The resettlement&#13;
impacts are described in Annex 6.&#13;
3.51   Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). To mitigate these adverse impacts, YRDPC&#13;
prepared a comprehensive strategy for implementation and submitted it to the Bank. The&#13;
RAP includes: (a) a detailed census of all people and assets affected; (b) the legal&#13;
framework for land acquisition; (c) a framework for implementation (objectives for land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement, compensation policies and rates, preferential policies, etc.);&#13;
(d) institutional arrangements; (e) costs and budgets; (f) an implementation schedule; (g)&#13;
participation and consultations; (h) grievance procedures; and (i) monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. The RAP covers all works including the resettlement and compensation of&#13;
the people affected by the project. The RAP, which the Bank found satisfactory, is&#13;
summarized in Annex 6.&#13;
3.52  Resettlement Strategy. The strategy was designed to ensure the standard of&#13;
living of all those affected will be improved or, at the least, restored. To achieve this&#13;
goal, the following principles were incorporated into the RAP.&#13;
(a)   Land acquisition and resettlement should be minimized as much as&#13;
possible;&#13;
(b)   Compensation for structures should be at replacement cost without&#13;
depreciation;&#13;
(c)   Compensation should be paid to the collectives before land acquisition and&#13;
used for productive purposes;&#13;
(d)   All infrastructure affected will be replaced;&#13;
(e)   Priority in job opportunities with the project will be given to those affected&#13;
by the project;&#13;
(f)    Land will be redistributed to farmers who lose land due to the project;&#13;
(g)   All affected enterprises will be helped to relocate and workers will be&#13;
given an allowance during relocation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
(h)   Those affected will be invited to participate in preparing  and&#13;
implementing the RAP; and&#13;
(i)   Those affected will be able to redress their grievances.&#13;
3.53  Resettlement Costs. These costs, which were included in the project, total an&#13;
estimated Y 51.33 million (which involve physical and price contingencies).&#13;
3.54 Implementation Arrangements. YRDPC is responsible for implementing the&#13;
entire resettlement component. It has a resettlement office to carry out the planning,&#13;
designing, budgeting, and coordination with the county resettlement offices (CROs). The&#13;
YRDPC resettlement office (YRDPCRO) has three field offices with 3 to 5 staff to&#13;
coordinate land acquisition, contract with local government, supervise resettlement&#13;
progress and support the CROs and township resettlement offices (TROs). The CROs&#13;
and TROs each have 5 to 10 staff and are responsible for implementing the land&#13;
acquisition, livelihood development programs, and compensation to those being resettled.&#13;
TMWC will be responsible for all resettlement and compensation of people affected by&#13;
the complementary works.&#13;
3.55  The RAP will be carried out in a highly participatory manner, and those affected&#13;
will be consulted at each stage in the planning and implementation; avenues for&#13;
redressing grievances were established at all levels. At present, all 54 individuals have&#13;
been resettled; several others who lost land received new land and many have started&#13;
agricultural production and sideline industries. YRDPC's monitoring indicates the&#13;
incomes of those affected have increased substantially (Table 3.2).  A detailed&#13;
implementation program is presented in Annex 6.&#13;

3.56  Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring of resettlement will occur at three&#13;
levels. First, YRDPC will conduct bimonthly internal reviews of land acquisition, civil&#13;
works, land development and redistribution, off-farm activities, restoration of public&#13;
facilities, training of CRO and TRO staff and the welfare of all project-affected people&#13;
(PAP). Second, an independent monitoring institution will conduct external reviews.&#13;
Yellow River Conservancy Commission Resettlement Office (YRCCRO), which was&#13;
selected as the independent monitor, will review the physical progress, PAP livelihood&#13;
restoration, PAP participation, grievances and effectiveness of grievance procedures, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
proposed measures for improvement. YRCCRO will submit semiannual monitoring&#13;
reports to YRDPC and Bank. Third, a seven-member international/local panel will meet&#13;
twice a year to review the resettlement progress and propose measures for improvement.&#13;
It will submit reports of its findings to YRDPC and the Bank.&#13;
3.57  During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Shanxi that resettlement&#13;
agencies at the provincial, county and township levels will carry out the resettlement&#13;
under the project according to the RAP. YRDPC will (a) also carry out resettlement&#13;
according to the RAP; (b) employ an independent monitoring institution by September&#13;
15, 1997, acceptable to the Bank, to evaluate the socioeconomic progress of those&#13;
affected by resettlement, (c) employ an independent panel of environment/ resettlement&#13;
experts by September 15, 1997, satisfactory to the Bank, to review the resettlement&#13;
semiannually (see para. 3.49); (d) promptly furnish to the Bank, for comment, reports of&#13;
the findings and recommendations of both groups; and (e) implement all&#13;
recommendations for follow-up actions, taking account of the Bank's comments.&#13;
I. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
3.58  Detailed designs have been completed for tunnels in GMT and SMT, underground&#13;
pumphouses, aqueducts, culverts and other structures linking tunnels. Tunnels 6 to 11 on&#13;
the GMT are already under construction (see para. 3.18). These designs, which form&#13;
about 80 percent of all civil works, were reviewed by the Bank and found to be&#13;
satisfactory. Bank missions also reviewed preliminary designs for the connecting works&#13;
and the complementary works for water supply for Taiyuan. Feasibility studies for&#13;
sewerage works and treatment were reviewed and found satisfactory. During appraisal,&#13;
the mission reviewed the detailed design for these components. All land acquisition for&#13;
construction for the GMT was completed; land acquisition for the SMT has started and&#13;
will be completed in 1998.&#13;
3.59  Designs for electrical and mechanical works pumps, motors and controls were&#13;
also completed, reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. The design for the&#13;
SCADA system will be completed by December 1997.&#13;
3.60 Prequalification documents for international competitive bidding (ICB) works for&#13;
the two underground pump stations and all tunnels on the SMT were completed, and were&#13;
reviewed and approved by the Bank. Bids for the tunnels and pump caverns have been&#13;
received and are being evaluated (see para. 3.69).  YRDPC has advertised in&#13;
Development Business and China Daily for prequalification of mechanical contractors,&#13;
which will be completed in June 1997. The Bank is reviewing the bidding documents for&#13;
electrical/mechanical works and these will be completed by June 1997.&#13;
3.61  Detailed proposals were also received for the technical assistance (TA) for Water&#13;
Sector Institutional Reform and Water Pollution Control and Industrial Management.&#13;
These proposals were found to be satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
J. CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.62  Construction of preparatory work for SMT started in 1994 and should be&#13;
completed in early 1997. At Pingguan, located close to tunnel 8 of GMT, YRDPC has&#13;
constructed a large field office for design and construction supervision. In addition, there&#13;
are several site offices already constructed along the SMT for receiving contractors.&#13;
Contract award for all major civil works contracts should be completed after Board&#13;
approval, expected in July 1997.&#13;
3.63   The main civil works construction will start in September 1997 and will be&#13;
completed in July 2002, after about five years (see Annex 10 for a detailed schedule). A&#13;
six-month commissioning period will be required before water can actually be supplied to&#13;
the city. Taiyuan will complete all its works by the end of 2002 to receive water. The&#13;
proposed schedule is considered reasonable and attainable. A detailed program of project&#13;
supervision is presented in Annex 13. The monitoring of all key construction activities is&#13;
presented in Annex 10.&#13;
K. PROJECT COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.64  The total costs of this phase of the project are estimated to be $1,351.6 million&#13;
equivalent, of which $492.9 million (36 percent) represents the foreign exchange&#13;
component. Annex 2 contains, in detail, the estimated costs of the project, which are&#13;
summarized in Table 3.3. The project base costs are in February 1997 prices. These&#13;
costs include interest during construction and commitment charges of $63.8 million. The&#13;
tunnel and other underground works costs are based on ongoing works where&#13;
international contractors have bid. The costs of electrical and mechanical equipment,&#13;
transformers and gates are based on recent quotations from manufacturers and suppliers'&#13;
prices for similar equipment and materials. The costs of the remaining items are based on&#13;
the consulting engineers' data for similar works. Physical contingencies are assumed as&#13;
follows:  10 percent for the aboveground works; 15 percent for the tunnels and&#13;
underground works; 10 percent for the remaining preparatory works, contract&#13;
administration, technical assistance, environmental management, studies and training;&#13;
and 10 percent for the electromechanical equipment. These percentages are considered to&#13;
be reasonable in view of the site features, the stage of design, and the contracts ongoing at&#13;
the site. The price escalation for costs expressed in foreign exchange (US dollars) has&#13;
been calculated in accordance with the anticipated international price escalation of 1.7&#13;
percent for 1997, 2.2 percent for 1998, and 2.5 percent for 1999 and thereafter. The price&#13;
escalation for costs expressed in local currency is calculated according to projected local&#13;
inflation rates of 6.2, 5.8, and 5.5 percent for 1997, 1998 and 1999 and thereafter,&#13;
respectively.&#13;

L. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.65      The financing proposed for the project is shown in Table 3.4.  To enable timely&#13;
and effective implementation of the project, it is necessary to ensure an adequate flow of&#13;
local funds, as shown  in  Annex  2.  YRDPC  will derive  all its counterpart funds from&#13;
surcharges on coal, electricity and water supplied. The surcharge collection was established&#13;
in 1993 and about $240 million had been collected up to 1995. Collection in 1995 was&#13;
$115 million and it is expected a slightly greater amount will be collected per year in 1996-&#13;
2001. The surcharge collections are fairly well-established and should not pose any major&#13;
issues  for counterpart fumding.   During  negotiations,  assurances  were  obtained  that&#13;
YRDPC would submit to the Bank by December 15 of each year the financing plan and the&#13;
proposed implementation program for the next year as approved by the Government, and&#13;
thereafter implement this program, taking into account the Bank's views on it.&#13;

3.66  China is eligible for single currency loans under the Bank's expanded program.&#13;
GOC and Shanxi Province have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan&#13;
terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of&#13;
their borrowing by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities with their net&#13;
trade flows, about 80 percent of which are US dollar denominated. They selected the&#13;
LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full maturity of this loan, compared to the&#13;
fixed-rate option that would have resulted in a shorter maturity. The Borrower judges&#13;
that it can manage any interest risk. The loan of $400 million would be for 20 years,&#13;
including a 5-year grace period at the standard rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single&#13;
currency loans. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent from the GOC through the&#13;
Shanxi Government to YRDPC with the same terms as the Bank loan. At negotiations,&#13;
an assurance was obtained from Shanxi that it would onlend the proceeds of the Bank&#13;
loan (other than for the Institutional Support Program for Shanxi Government) to&#13;
YRDPC, under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20-year term, including 5 years of&#13;
grace at the same interest rate and commitment fee as those paid by the Borrower. The&#13;
execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between Shanxi and YRDPC, satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.&#13;
3.67  A small portion of the financing is from official bilateral sources for pipe-making&#13;
equipment, consultants and for special steel for the pipes.  Since the funds are not&#13;
immediately required, it is not proposed to have a cross-effectiveness clause in the loan&#13;
agreement. However, we propose to have a cross-default clause; in the event the funds do&#13;
not become available by July 1, 1998 or there is a suspension or cancellation of the&#13;
cofinancing, the Borrower is obligated to cover the shortfall in funds.&#13;
M. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.68  The procurement arrangements for the project have followed the Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published in January&#13;
1995 and revised in January and August 1996, as well as experience gained from&#13;
previous Bank infrastructure projects in China. The Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
(SBDs), which have been agreed between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Bank in&#13;
August 1996, would be adopted for all international competitive bidding (ICB) and&#13;
national competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works and goods. For the appointment of&#13;
consultants, the Bank's Model Contract Agreement for Consultants would be used. The&#13;
main items to be procured are: (a) the main civil works; (b) electrical and mechanical&#13;
equipment; and (c) engineering and consulting services. The procurement arrangements&#13;
for the proposed projects are summarized in Table 3.5.&#13;

3.69  Civil Works. All contracts for civil works valued at $10 million equivalent or&#13;
above would use ICB procedures. There will be eight lots of civil works contracts (see&#13;
Annex 3). The procurement of the main civil works, through ICB procedures, has been&#13;
divided into three lots, with a total value of $328 million, one for the underground pump&#13;
stations and two sets of tunnels for the SMTs and aqueducts and culverts. These contracts&#13;
would be mainly financed by the proposed Bank loan. All civil works contracts will require&#13;
prequalification. A Disputes Review Board will be included in contracts valued at $50&#13;
million or more. The prequalification documents have been reviewed by the Bank and the&#13;
prequalifications have been implemented by YRDPC. A total of 10 prequalified contractors&#13;
have tendered for ICB bids and the bids are being evaluated. Bidding documents for these&#13;
main civil works have been reviewed in the Bank. All other civil works (16 contracts),&#13;
valued at $69.6 million, will be financed under NCB procedures because they are&#13;
distributed and small in nature and not of interest to foreign contractors.&#13;
3.70  Goods. All contracts for goods valued at $1 million equivalent or more would be&#13;
awarded under ICB procedures. Concrete pipes, pumps, electric motors, mechanical works&#13;
and control systems valued at $130.4 million (three lots) will also be procured using ICB&#13;
procedures. Qualified domestic manufacturers would be eligible for a margin of preference&#13;
of 15 percent of CIF prices or the actual customs duties, whichever is lower, in the bid&#13;
evaluation. Items estimated to cost less than $1 million equivalent will use NCB&#13;
procedures up to an aggregate total of $59.7 million. The proposed Bank loan would also&#13;
finance environmental and hydrologic forecasting equipment for $4.3 million, which would&#13;
be procured through limited international bidding (LIB) procedures following the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines. LIB procedures are being used because of the specialized nature of the&#13;
equipment. Items or groups of items estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $300,000&#13;
per contract, up to an aggregate amount of $3.1 million, may be purchased on the basis of at&#13;
least three quotations from qualified suppliers eligible under the Bank's procurement&#13;
guidelines for national shopping.&#13;
3.71  Procurement Review. All contract packages for works and goods financed by the&#13;
Bank and estimated to cost $10.0 million equivalent or more for works, $1.0 million&#13;
equivalent or more for goods and consultant contracts valued at $100,000 equivalent or&#13;
more for firms and $50,000 equivalent or more for individuals would be subject to the&#13;
Bank's prior review (about 95 percent of the loan). In addition, the first three NCB&#13;
contracts less than $10.0 million in value for works and $1.0 million in value for goods will&#13;
be subject to the Bank's prior review.&#13;
3.72  Consultants.  Consultants are needed for construction supervision, detailed&#13;
design, reviews, engineering and environment panels, institutional reform and training. A&#13;
detailed list is provided in Table 3.6. All consultants would be selected in accordance&#13;
with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," January 1997.&#13;
YRDPC will retain the present international consultants for detail design (210 person-&#13;
months) who have prepared the feasibility study, the detailed designs and bidding&#13;
documents, on grounds of intimate knowledge of the site, river hydrology, local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
construction conditions, and the overall project in the interests of project safety,&#13;
economy, efficiency and expediency. The consultants have also been involved in&#13;
evaluation for prequalifying of contractors and will be involved in bid evaluation with&#13;
YRDPC. The consultant services for construction supervision for tunnels and pump&#13;
caverns (479 person-months), connecting works pipelines (200 person-months) and for&#13;
the environmental master plan (75 person-months) for Taiyuan City would be procured&#13;
using competitive procedures (QCBS) following the Guidelines. The $0.8 million of&#13;
consultancy for institutional support is a quality-based service, which is highly&#13;
specialized and needs intimate knowledge of Chinese and local practices. Another $2.2&#13;
million of consultants for engineering design panels, environmental/resettlement panels,&#13;
groundwater monitoring, etc. will be individual consultants.&#13;

N. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.73   The proposed Bank loan of $400 million would be disbursed over a period of five&#13;
years as detailed in Table 3.7. For expenditures relating to training, and contracts for&#13;
works valued at less than $10.0 million equivalent other than the first three, goods valued&#13;
at less than $1.0 million equivalent other than the first three, services valued at less than&#13;
$100,000 equivalent for firms and $50,000 for individual consultants, training, and clean&#13;
technology pollution fund subloan reimbursements would be made on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Documentation supporting the SOEs would be&#13;
retained by YRDPC and made available for review by Bank supervision missions. To&#13;
facilitate disbursements, a Special Account in US dollars, with an authorized allocation of&#13;
$15 million (less than four months of average eligible expenditures), will be established&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
in a bank and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Applications for&#13;
replenishment would be submitted monthly or when the amounts withdrawn are equal to&#13;
50 percent of the authorized allocation, whichever occurs sooner. Retroactive financing&#13;
in an aggregate amount of $28 million would be provided under the loan to cover&#13;
payments made for expenditures on civil works, urgently needed goods, consultant&#13;
services, and training incurred before signing the Loan Agreement, but after October 20,&#13;
1996.&#13;

3.74   The disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan is given in Annex 4,&#13;
Table 1. The disbursement period covers the first phase of the construction period. The&#13;
disbursements profile for this project varies slightly from the agriculture sector profiles.&#13;
There is a slow startup because of the time taken by large civil works contractors to&#13;
mobilize. However, once mobilization is completed, the disbursement proceeds rapidly,&#13;
and it conforms with the disbursement profile of other agricultural projects (see Annex4).&#13;
The disbursement schedule is based on the detailed project implementation program. The&#13;
loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
0. PROJECT MONITORING, REPORTING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.75  Supervision. The project would be supervised through Bank missions whose&#13;
frequency would be guided by the progress of the works. However, on the average, a&#13;
mission at about nine-month intervals would be mounted; a Supervision Mission Plan is&#13;
presented in Annex 13. In addition to field missions, staff input would be provided at&#13;
Headquarters for project-related activities such as completion of supervision reports,&#13;
procurement documentation and contracts, staff training and equipment proposals and&#13;
follow-up and review of the studies on water sector institutional reforms, industrial waste&#13;
management and antipollution fund utilization. Moreover, the Bank would monitor&#13;
progress of implementation of all project components through quarterly progress reports&#13;
to be submitted to the Bank. It is estimated that over the implementation period of the&#13;
project the total time expended on supervision would be in the order of 100 person-&#13;
weeks.&#13;
3.76  Monitoring.   During implementation, project performance, including the&#13;
achievement of physical targets and attainment of other project objectives will be&#13;
monitored by YRDPC through the use of performance indicators, reports on the&#13;
environment and land acquisition and resettlement, progress reports and auditing of&#13;
project accounts. In addition, upon completion, the project will be reviewed in an&#13;
Implementation Completion Report.  Annex 12 presents the proposed monitoring&#13;
indicators for the project. Each of the project components' indices will track annual&#13;
progress in attaining targets during implementation and impact objectives after the project&#13;
is completed. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that YRDPC shall, by April 30&#13;
of each year and for three years after completion of the project, furnish to the Bank an&#13;
annual monitoring report, in a format acceptable to the Bank, covering all components of&#13;
the project, in conformance with the agreed monitoring indicators. In addition, YRDPC&#13;
will provide semiannual progress reports by April 15 and October 15 of the project&#13;
implementation in the previous semester including any revisions to the project or its RAP&#13;
or EMP.&#13;
3.77  Reporting. Based on the monitoring activities described in Annex 13, YRDPC&#13;
will submit to the Bank an annual monitoring report. This report will be based on the&#13;
following reports, which will be submitted to the Bank during the course of a given year:&#13;
(a)   Annual environmental monitoring reports during the construction phase.&#13;
(b)   A  series of internal and external (independent) monitoring reports&#13;
assessing the impact of land acquisition and resettlement on various&#13;
segments of the local population, describing the income restoration&#13;
strategies followed and the number of people compensated (para. 3.56 and&#13;
Annex 6).&#13;
(c)   Annual audit reports for the project accounts and financial statements&#13;
(para. 3.79).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
(d)   Semiannual progress reports for all project activities and up-to-date&#13;
performance indicators.&#13;
(e)   A Project Implementation Completion Report would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the loan closing date.&#13;
P. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
3.78  Accounting. Up to now, YRDPC has maintained two sets of accounts, one set for&#13;
capital construction and the other for operation. Since these two sets of accounts are not&#13;
consolidated, the balance sheet for operations does not include construction work-in-&#13;
progress and related financing. However, under the newly revised general principles set&#13;
forth by the Ministry of Finance, enterprises will have to consolidate the capital&#13;
construction accounts with the operations accounts. YRDPC will consolidate its accounts&#13;
and special technical assistance using foreign consultants has been included as part of the&#13;
project to help do this.&#13;
3.79  Auditing. Audits of Bank-financed projects have been conducted by the Shanxi&#13;
Provincial Audit Bureau (SPAB) under the guidance of the State Audit Administration&#13;
(SAA). This arrangement is satisfactory. Assurances were obtained from YRDPC and&#13;
Shanxi (for the Institutional Components for Water Sector Institutional Reform and Water&#13;
Pollution Control and Industrial Waste Management) that they would maintain separate&#13;
accounts for the project and that the audited project accounts of Shanxi and the audited&#13;
financial statements of YRDPC and Shanxi Government would be furnished to the Bank&#13;
within six months after the end of each fiscal year. The Borrower would arrange for audits&#13;
of the Special Account and the details of withdrawals from the loan account made on the&#13;
basis of SOEs and the auditor's opinion as to whether such withdrawals were made against&#13;
expenditures eligible for disbursement by the Bank. Audited financial statements would&#13;
also be required to be furnished to Shanxi (for forwarding to the Bank on request) by&#13;
enterprises borrowing subloans under the clean technology pollution fund. YRDPC has&#13;
developed an internal auditing section (staffed with chartered accountants), which&#13;
periodically will examine the accounts of each operating unit. The objective of these&#13;
examinations is primarily to test for accuracy and compliance with Ministry of Finance&#13;
regulations. The section will serve as liaison between external auditors and the project&#13;
entity. The Bank will review the internal auditing function during project implementation&#13;
with a view toward increasing its efficiency and usefulness to YRDPC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
4.1    General Structure. The Government of Shanxi Province (GSP) will take overall&#13;
responsibility for implementing the project. Recognizing the project's importance and&#13;
complexity, and based on successful experiences elsewhere in the country, the GSP&#13;
created the Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project Headquarters (WWTPH) to guide the&#13;
project management office(s) and coordinate the construction and resettlement efforts of&#13;
related organizations and authorities. The general organization of the project is shown in&#13;
Annex 9.&#13;
4.2   The main role of WWTPH, which is headed by the Vice Governor of Shanxi&#13;
Province and made up of representatives from various key departments of the province, is&#13;
to oversee the Wanjiazhai Yellow River Diversion Project Corporation (YRDPC) in&#13;
policy and fiscal matters, as well as project construction and resettlement, and to&#13;
coordinate issues and problem resolution at the provincial level.&#13;
4.3   Project Management Office (PMO). YRDPC, whose function is to build,&#13;
operate and maintain the project, has established a PMO for the project. Originally&#13;
known as the Yellow River Diversion Project Bureau (YRDPB), YRDPC was initially set&#13;
up as an administrative organization of the provincial government, in order to have easy&#13;
access to other government organizations and authorities. In 1994, it was approved by&#13;
the provincial government and registered as a state-owned enterprise.  Its general&#13;
manager, the former director of the Planning Commission of Shanxi Province, reports&#13;
directly to WWTPH and the provincial government. At present, it has 734 staff and more&#13;
(up to 1,500) will be added during the construction and operational phases. Although&#13;
YRDPC was formed recently, its key personnel have been involved in the construction&#13;
and/or operation of similar projects, or involved in the planning and preparation of this&#13;
project; thus, it is capable of managing the project's construction and operations. The&#13;
PMO will cooperate with agencies in charge of resettlement, in order to coordinate the&#13;
project's resettlement component. Further, it has worked out a plan for progressively&#13;
reforming the corporation from an administrative organization to an economic enterprise&#13;
during the life of the project. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that&#13;
YRDPC will maintain its project management office with competent staff in adequate&#13;
numbers and it will have responsibility andfunctions satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
B. PROJECT EXECUTION AND SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION&#13;
4.4   YRDPC will execute the project, acting as the employer. It will be responsible for&#13;
preparing and executing all bids for civil works, goods and services; also, for managing&#13;
construction, cost and quality control of all civil works and the installation of plant and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
equipment. It will be assisted by the Wanjiazhai Project Supervision Joint Venture&#13;
(WPSJV), comprised of six organizations, which will supervise construction; by the&#13;
Tianjin Investigation and Design Institute (TIDI) and Shanxi Investigation and Design&#13;
Institute (SIDI), which will oversee design and design changes; by foreign and local&#13;
consultants, which will assist in managing the contract, as well as cost and quality&#13;
control. Also, a panel of experts (POE, para. 4.8) will review design changes and any&#13;
special construction problems semiannually. In addition, a dispute review board (DRB,&#13;
para. 4.10) will be appointed to resolve any disputes that arise with the contractors (see&#13;
Annex 9).&#13;
4.5   Construction Supervision. WPSJV will act as Engineer ' for the Employer and&#13;
be responsible for supervising daily and detailed fieldwork for quality control, certifying&#13;
payments to contractors, maintaining a field laboratory for testing materials delivered to&#13;
the site, and revising design documents/drawings according to field conditions. Its six&#13;
supervision organizations are licensed and have experience with the construction and&#13;
supervision of similar projects. With support from YRDPC and assistance from the&#13;
consultants, WPSJV will have the capability required to mange the construction of such a&#13;
complex and large project. The organization of WPSJV is shown in Annex 9. At&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that YRDPC will continue to employ an Engineer&#13;
with qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank in order to&#13;
undertake the construction supervision.&#13;
4.6   Engineering Design and Technical Assistance.  Having been retained by&#13;
YRDPC, TIDI is assisting with the design of civil and electromechanical works from the&#13;
inlet to the end of tunnels to Daliang Reservoir on the north main line and the end of the&#13;
south main line; SIDI is assisting with the design of civil and electromechanical works&#13;
from Daliang Reservoir, including the reservoir, to the end of the north main line and&#13;
connection works, starting from Fen-] Reservoir. Both are experienced institutes and&#13;
have recently designed some large- and mid-scaled hydro projects.&#13;
4.7   Nevertheless, YRDPC recognizes the very complex and delicate nature of the&#13;
construction and will therefore continue to use international consultants during&#13;
implementation. International engineering consultants have also been actively involved&#13;
in reviewing the project design and resolving specific technical matters related to the&#13;
pump station, TBM technology, tunneling and electromechanical equipment/plant. A&#13;
number of technical delegations and prominent tunnel and electromechanical experts&#13;
have visited the project site, offered valuable suggestions and shared their experiences&#13;
with their Chinese counterparts in building large and complex projects.&#13;
4.8   Panel of Experts.  YRDPC will continue to employ a POE, comprised of&#13;
international and domestic specialists, to help resolve particular technical problems&#13;
"Engineer" as defined in the Bank's Standard Bidding Document for Procurement of Works, January&#13;
1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
related to the project and advise on major design and construction issues. The POE,&#13;
which has effectively reviewed the project's major technical issues, has been funded by&#13;
YRDPC. Under the proposed project, the POE would meet regularly. At negotiations, an&#13;
assurance was obtained from YRDPC that it will employ a POE by September 30, 1997&#13;
that is independent from the project's designers, that the POE will conduct, at least twice&#13;
annually or more frequently as needed, reviews of designs and technical specifications&#13;
and advise on unforeseen problems relating to project implementation, and that YRDPC&#13;
will report the POE's findings to the Bank and Borrower on a semiannual basis.&#13;
4.9   Foreign Consultants. Due to the project's magnitude and complexity, and the&#13;
use of international civil contractors and equipment suppliers, YRDPC will appoint&#13;
experienced and qualified international consultants who will play a key role in assisting&#13;
YRDPC and WPSJV to manage project construction. Their scope of work will include&#13;
contract management, cost control, scheduling, and construction site administration&#13;
during the entire implementation period. The total input of engineering services and&#13;
technical assistance is estimated to be about 679 person-months of foreign consultants'&#13;
services, which is considered reasonable for a project of this sort (see Annex 14).&#13;
4.10 Dispute Review Board (DRB). Based on the experience with other projects&#13;
involving international contractors in China, YRDPC recognizes the need to have a DRB&#13;
to help it resolve the conflicts that emerge during construction between the employer and&#13;
contractors. Therefore, YRDPC and the contractors will jointly employ a DRB to resolve&#13;
such disputes.&#13;
4.11  The procedures for inspecting, maintaining and monitoring the safety of&#13;
underground/civil works in China generally follow international practices and are&#13;
considered satisfactory for the proposed project.&#13;
4.12 Environmental Management Plan (EMP). For the project works, the EMP will&#13;
be implemented by YRDPC's Environmental Management Office (EMO), whose&#13;
functions would be to ensure that all contractors adhere to the relevant environmental&#13;
specifications in their contracts.  The EMO will also monitor the environmental&#13;
parameters for air, water and land in the construction and resettlement sites.&#13;
C. OVERALL COORDINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OTHER COMPONENTS&#13;
4.13  Resettlement Coordination. Various agencies and jurisdictions, at different&#13;
levels, are responsible for resettlement; thus, coordination will be essential and will be&#13;
carried out by two agencies. As the owner of the project, YRDPC will supervise and&#13;
coordinate resettlement activities through WWTPH. YRDPC will also be responsible for&#13;
channeling resettlement funds to the local governments' resettlement agencies. For this&#13;
reason, it has set up a Resettlement Office to maintain close liaison between the&#13;
Provincial Resettlement Bureau and local governments at various levels, as well as to&#13;
supervise and coordinate the program. And, since the GSP has ultimate authority for&#13;
resettlement and bears the responsibility for the welfare of its citizens, its Provincial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Resettlement Bureau will also be involved in coordinating the various local government&#13;
agencies and provincial departments.&#13;
D. OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.14  Institutional Components.  The Water Sector Institutional Reform will be&#13;
carried out by SCSR, SWCD and SBPC (see para. 3.30). A large coordination working&#13;
group convened by SWCD will be involved in working out details of this component.&#13;
The larger group will consist of Taiyuan City municipal agencies such as TMWC,&#13;
Municipal Commission, Water Saving Office, etc.&#13;
4.15  The Water Pollution Control and Industrial Waste Component would be carried&#13;
out by the Taiyuan EPB under the guidance of the Provincial EPB.&#13;
4.16  YRDPC's organizational arrangement for project operations and maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) will be quite different than for construction: Its operational departments will be&#13;
created about two years before the first phase of the project is completed. YRDPC's&#13;
organization will be transformed gradually to have the capability to operate and maintain&#13;
the entire system. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that YRDPC will&#13;
prepare under guidelines acceptable to the Bank and furnish to the Bank a program by&#13;
June 30, 1999 for smooth transformation of YRDPC from a construction entity to an&#13;
operating entity and thereafter will implement this plan, taking into account the Bank's&#13;
comments on this matter. The plan will have details of the new organizational structure,&#13;
staffing numbers and qualifications, and training programs for staff to make the&#13;
transition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
5. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. WATER RESOURCES AND SUPPLY ENTITIES&#13;
5.1   YRDPC is responsible for construction of the proposed project, including the&#13;
general main tunnel, pumping stations, south main line, and connection works [see para&#13;
3.2 (a)]. YRDPC was registered as a corporation in December 1995, and will become the&#13;
executing agency to operate and manage the project upon completion of construction.&#13;
YRDPC is also responsible for providing investment capital for the Shanxi Government's&#13;
share in the Wanjiazhai Dam.&#13;
5.2   To receive diverted water from YRDPC, TMWC will need to expand its treatment&#13;
capacity by constructing the Huyan water treatment plant and installing additional&#13;
transmission/distribution pipelines in Taiyuan city by year 2002. Since the project is&#13;
designed to supply water to industrial and domestic users in Taiyuan through TMWC and&#13;
since YRDPC will be liable for repayment of the Bank loan, determination of end-user&#13;
water tariffs becomes critical as it will directly impact TMWC's ability to pay for&#13;
purchased water and in turn YRDPC's ability to repay the Bank loan. Therefore,&#13;
financial forecasts along with projected water tariffs are prepared for both YRDPC and&#13;
TMWC, and both entities shall be covered by financial covenants.&#13;
5.3   Shanxi Water Conservancy Department (SWCD) governs Fen Reservoir 1&#13;
Management Bureau (Fen-1), Fen Water Conservancy Management Bureau (FWCMB),&#13;
and Zhang Zhe Reservoir Administrative Bureau (ZZRAB). As diverted Yellow River&#13;
water will flow through Fen Reservoir 1 and Fen-1 is responsible for management and&#13;
operation of the reservoir, YRDPC will need to have an agreement (in the interim until&#13;
Fen-l is incorporated within the Fen Basin Authority) with Fen-I detailing (1)&#13;
management fee to be collected by Fen-1, and (2) entitlement of water volume by Fen-1&#13;
and YRDPC at discharge point after the proposed project is commissioning.&#13;
5.4   Fen Reservoir 2, downstream of Fen Reservoir 1, will be used to adjust Fen River&#13;
water volume during different seasons. The Fen-2 Reservoir Water Enterprise Company&#13;
Ltd. (Fen-2) will construct, own, and manage Fen Reservoir 2.&#13;
5.5   Taiyuan Groundwater Resource Management Co. (TGRM) and the Self-Supply&#13;
Tubewell Commission (SSTC) are both responsible for monitoring, licensing, and&#13;
management of groundwater resource.&#13;
B. PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
5.6   Total project cost before interest during construction (IDC) is estimated at&#13;
Y 11.52 billion for all project works. Based on such cost estimate, plus required&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
investment in Wanjiazhai Dam of Y 2.23 billion but excluding about Y 0.2 billion for&#13;
institutional reform and water pollution control components that are not under YRDPC's&#13;
responsibility, YRDPC's costs amount to Y 13.55 billion prior to IDC, or Y 14.23 billion&#13;
after IDC and the foreign exchange gain/loss is taken into account (see Annex 8,&#13;
Summary Table, page 216).&#13;
5.7   YRDPC's capital requirement during 1993 to 2001 is estimated to be Y 14.07&#13;
billion, which is Y 165 million less than the above estimated total cost of Y 14.23 as the&#13;
foreign exchange loss during construction is a noncash item caused by revaluation of&#13;
long-term loans.&#13;
5.8   The proposed project, along with other nonproject components, will be financed&#13;
mainly by GSP surcharges, the World Bank loan, a small cofinancing loan, and&#13;
investment income from Wanjiazhai Dam's net income from electricity sales. GSP&#13;
surcharges, to be collected and about Y 7.6 billion used for the project before the end of&#13;
year 2001, consist of surcharges on coal sales, provincial electricity consumption,&#13;
outbound electricity sales, and water consumption (see Annex 8). The Bank loan of&#13;
Y 3.8 billion, $400 million equivalent, and a cofinancing loan of Y 273 million, $30&#13;
million equivalent, will be borrowed by YRDPC. Because Wanjiazhai Dam is to be&#13;
completed by end- 1998 and will start to have power revenue by 1999, YRDPC will then&#13;
be entitled to investment income. Such investment income is estimated at Y 911 million&#13;
during 1999 to 2001.&#13;
5.9   Altogether, a financing gap during 1996-2001 may still exist. Such a shortage&#13;
could be financed by (a) allocation of additional water revenue derived from the water&#13;
tariff adjustment starting in 1997; (b) an adjusted water resource fee; and (c) the Shanxi&#13;
Investment and Trust Company in case of a short-term financing need.  During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom Shanxi that each year incremental revenues&#13;
from tariff adjustments and increased water resources fees between 1997 and 2001 will&#13;
be allocated to YRDPC by December 31 of that year as a capital contribution to YRDPC.&#13;
5.10  Huyan water treatment plant and associated pipelines in Taiyuan city will cost&#13;
Y 2.55 billion, of which Y 900 million will be financed by budgets of provincial and&#13;
municipal governments as well as by TMWC's internal cash generation; the remaining&#13;
will be funded by Japanese OECF loans.&#13;
C. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
5.11  YRDPC's past financial statements for 1992-95 are presented in Annex 8. As a&#13;
construction organization, YRDPC follows "financial accounting systems for&#13;
construction units" and prepares only the capital balance statement. As of end-1995,&#13;
YRDPC had invested Y 1,134 million in project preparation and construction and Y 424&#13;
million in Wanjiazhai Dam; both are financed by GSP surcharges. Details on GSP&#13;
surcharges and YRDPC's existing financial reporting systems are described in Annex 8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
5.12 TMWC's past financial statements for 1992-95 are presented in Annex S. In&#13;
1995, the average water tariff for industry and domestic users in Taiyuan city was Y 1.1&#13;
and Y 0.7/mr  [value-added tax (VAT) inclusive] respectively, or Y 0.86/m3 on average&#13;
(excluding VAT). Despite increases in net income since 1994 due to water tariff&#13;
adjustment, TMWC has not kept much as retained earnings for future investment because&#13;
most net income was used for the GSP water surcharge paid to the Government. Most&#13;
capital investments such as installation of transmission pipelines are still funded by the&#13;
municipal budget rather than self-financing or borrowing. As a result, TMWC maintains&#13;
a healthy financial structure with a low outstanding liability for the past three years.&#13;
Adjustment of water tariffs is subject to government approval. Therefore, even though&#13;
TMWC has adopted an enterprise accounting system and prepares commercial financial&#13;
statements, it is not yet a financially autonomous company.&#13;
5.13 As quasi profit-making organizations, Fen-1, FWCAB, and ZZRAB are not&#13;
included in the governmental budget. For financial reporting purposes, all three bureaus&#13;
submit their own balance sheet and income statement to WSCD for aggregation. Fen- 1's&#13;
earnings are mainly from water resource fees paid by FWCAB (which is downstream on&#13;
the Fen River) and partly from electricity sales, while FWCAB's revenue is primarily&#13;
from water sales to irrigation and industries. Fen-1 charged FWCAB water resource fees&#13;
for an allocated quota for irrigation and industrial consumption at 1 fen and 10.5 fen per&#13;
m3 respectively in 1995 (the latter was increased to 15 fen in 1996). FWCAB charged&#13;
3                                   3&#13;
irrigation water consumption at 5.5 fen per m and industry consumption at 48 fen per m3.&#13;
In view of the charge limit set by the Price Bureau, both Fen-I and FWCAB have to&#13;
underprovide depreciation and incur less-than-required costs in order to ensure a small&#13;
amount of surplus for employee benefits. The imputed cost-recovery water resource fee&#13;
levels for Fen-1's water supplies to irrigation and industry are 9 fen and 18 fen per m3&#13;
and imputed FRCAB cost-recovery water prices for irrigation and industry are estimated&#13;
at 7 fen and 68 fen per m3 if necessary costs are taken into account. SWCD's past three&#13;
years' financial statements are presented in Annex 8.&#13;
D. WATER PRICING&#13;
5.14 Water pricing for YRDPC and TMWC is determined by the estimated total capital&#13;
investment cost which belongs to SMT, the estimated cost for the Huyan water treatment&#13;
plant, suggested financing plans for both YRDPC and TMWC, forecast water&#13;
transfer/supply volume, operational and financial assumptions, along with agreed&#13;
financial requirement indicators (see below and Annex 8).&#13;
5.15 The GMT cost is a common cost for SMT and NMT and thus should be shared&#13;
based on the estimated eventual water transfer volume, 56.5 percent and 43.5 percent,&#13;
respectively. Investment in Wanjiazhai Dam, also part of the capital requirement during&#13;
phase I (1993-2001), is a long-term investment, and thus is not subject to cost sharing.&#13;
5.16  The cost for SMT consists of the shared GMT cost, the cost to complete SMT,&#13;
and the cost of connection works, which in total equal 81.72 percent of total phase I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
investment cost including capitalized interest and foreign exchange gain/loss. That is,&#13;
only 81.72 percent of total phase I cost will be considered in determination of water&#13;
tariffs for TMWC starting from year 2002; the remaining 18.28 percent of cost will&#13;
belong to NMT and will not be subject to depreciation until completion of NMT.&#13;
5.17  Phase I capital requirements will be financed through GSP surcharges as well as&#13;
borrowing. Sources of funds and their uses are assumed to be as follows:&#13;
(a)   The World Bank loan of $400 million and the cofinancing loan of $30&#13;
million will be used to finance foreign currency requirements for the&#13;
proposed project;&#13;
(b)   Investment income from Wanjiazhai Dam, assumed to be Y 911 million&#13;
during 1999-2001, can be used in project construction;&#13;
(c)    GSP surcharges can be used to finance Wanjiazhai Dam and project&#13;
activities if a shortage of funds still exists after application of the previous&#13;
two financing sources; and&#13;
(d)   If a shortage still exists, particularly during 1997-1998, additional&#13;
surcharges or incremental water revenue as a result of water tariff&#13;
adjustment will be needed.&#13;
5.18  At present, the provincial price bureau has authority to determine and adjust water&#13;
tariffs within the province. Shanxi Province is aware of the necessity of adjusting water&#13;
tariffs to recover the capital investments of the project for repayment of the loans. To&#13;
smooth out the impact on users of the impending tariff adjustment, the provincial price&#13;
bureau has decided to increase water tariffs gradually from 1997 for all users. The goal of&#13;
the proposed tariff adjustment is to price water based on operating costs and debt service&#13;
in the year 2002 when the project is put into operation (see Table 5.1). These tariffs are&#13;
essentially equal to the long-run marginal cost of water in the year 2000. It is hoped that&#13;
such a policy could further stimulate water savings and rationalize the water consumption&#13;
structure among different sectors. It should be noted the average tariff ratio for irrigation&#13;
water to industrial water is presently 1:10 and with the new tariff structure it will reduce&#13;
to 1:4 in the year 2000. These tariffs apply to TMWC-supplied water, which covers the&#13;
Yellow River-diverted water and groundwater supplied by TMWC. However, there is&#13;
also self-supplied groundwater by industries and enterprises, which is now priced at much&#13;
lower tariffs and controlled by the Water Savings Office of Taiyuan Municipality.&#13;
During negotiation, assurances were obtainedfrom Shanxi that it would prepare, on the&#13;
basis of guidelines acceptable to the Bank. (a) a program by February 15, 1998 to&#13;
ensure that, by June 30, 2002, self-supplied groundwater would have the same tariffs as&#13;
for all other water supplied in Shanxi; and (b) a program by June 15, 1998 to ensure that&#13;
groundwater extraction would also be limited to safe yield levels. Shanxi would&#13;
thereafter implement these programs, taking into account the Bank's comments on them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
5.19  Water sales were 144 million m3 in 1995 and therefore the additional water&#13;
revenue caused by the above pricing reform action plan would amount to more than Y 1&#13;
billion between 1997 and 2000. The provincial price bureau intends to use this additional&#13;
revenue to finance either YRDPC or water supply projects within Taiyuan city, or deposit&#13;
it partially as a debt repayment fund. Because water tariffs should cover the debt&#13;
repayment component after project commissioning, and because financing plans for&#13;
YRDPC and TMWC indicate both organizations are short of local counterpart funds for&#13;
their investments, it would be more justified if this additional water revenue were used&#13;
for both YRDPC and TMWC's project investment instead of debt repayment.&#13;

5.20  With a view to obtaining economic efficiency and promoting prudent financial&#13;
management, at negotiations assurances were obtained that financial performance&#13;
indices for YRDPC and TMWCs' water supply operations will meet the following&#13;
requirements:&#13;
(a)   YRDPC would take all measures, including but not limited to tariff&#13;
adjustments, to ensure a debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.2&#13;
throughout the whole debt repayment period (2003-16), and a rate of&#13;
return on two-year average notionally revalued net fixed assets in service&#13;
of no less than 2 percentfor year 2011-16.&#13;
(b)   Shanxi Province would cause TMWC to take all measures, including but&#13;
not limited to tariff adjustments, to ensure that (1) debt/equity ratio is&#13;
better than 70/30 between 1997 and 2001, (2) a debt service coverage&#13;
ratio of no less than 1.2 is achieved between 2002 and 2016 when YRDPC&#13;
is paying off its subsidiary loan; and (3) a rate of return on two-year&#13;
notionally revalued net fixed assets in service of no less than 2 percent is&#13;
achievedfor the same period of 2002 and thereafter.&#13;
E. FUTURE FINANCES&#13;
5.21  Table 5.2 illustrates the YRDPC's financial projection summary of a simulated&#13;
case in which the NMT and all possible investments after year 2002 are excluded. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
simulation indicates the projected water tariffs to be charged by YRDPC to TMWC.&#13;
Between 2002 and 2004, rate of return on fixed assets is estimated to be negative due to&#13;
projected net losses in such years. Despite forecast net loss, the minimum debt service&#13;
coverage ratio of 1.2 can still be met during these years because internal cash generations&#13;
(mainly from depreciation) are sufficient to cover principal repayments.&#13;
5.22    The  comprehensive  financial projections  for YRDPC  (both  for the  proposed&#13;
project and for the full project including the NMT) and TMWC for 1996-2006 are&#13;
presented in Annex 8, and summarized in Table 5.3 and Table 5.4 below. Those&#13;
projections are based on the assumptions contained in Annex 8, which include pricing&#13;
mechanisms and water tariff adjustments needed to allow YRDPC and TMWC to achieve&#13;
the above financial performance targets. In Table 5.4, the average tariff before year 2002&#13;
is the tariff that should be maintained by TMWC for its investment needs, not the higher&#13;
tariffs suggested by the tariff reform action plan.&#13;

5.23   Sensitivity analysis (see Annex 8) shows that projected water tariffs for YRDPC&#13;
and TMWC will be more sensitive to the accuracy of estimated water transfer volume. It&#13;
emphasizes the importance of timely completion of the proposed project as well as Huyan&#13;
water treatment plant-both phase I and phase II. The system's ability to transfer water&#13;
as scheduled and to have an estimated matching capacity to receive transferred water is&#13;
critical to realization of the estimated water transfer volume by YRDPC and water supply&#13;
volume by TMWC. Reduction in investment income from Wanjiazhai Dam would also&#13;
make the projected tariffs higher, because additional water tariff adjustment would be&#13;
needed should YRDPC have weaker capability to meet the financial covenants. Cost&#13;
overrun of Huyan water treatment plant's phase I cost would impact tariffs by TMWC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
since in the current projection model it is assumed that any shortage of funds after&#13;
availing of financing from the provincial and municipal governments and TMWC's&#13;
internal cash generation will be financed by borrowing.&#13;
5.24  The sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed tariffs for YRDPC and TMWC&#13;
are less sensitive to cost overrun of the proposed project as it is assumed that a shortage&#13;
of capital (after drawing down the World Bank loan, cofinancing loan, investment&#13;
income, and GSP surcharges) will be financed by additional surcharges or funds from the&#13;
provincial government free of charge. With regard to the proposed reused water, if the&#13;
tariff is set at Y 1.5/m3 instead of Y 0.2 as currently assumed, the projected tariffs for&#13;
YRDPC and TMWC will drop by about Y 0.5. Therefore, water reuse mechanisms,&#13;
including construction and rehabilitation of wastewater treatment plants in Taiyuan and&#13;
water allocation and pricing schemes, need to be put in place as early as possible.&#13;
F. FUTURE REFORM&#13;
5.25  The existing water resource and supply institutions have different priorities in&#13;
water allocation, different levels of financial autonomy, and various reporting systems.&#13;
These differences have resulted in problems such as insufficient maintenance, lower-than-&#13;
market-price tariffs, rigid pricing mechanisms, and questionable water allocations. Water&#13;
has to be managed in all its forms from rainfall in the catchment to reaching the sea, with&#13;
proper controls through a licensing system. Licenses for surface water or groundwater&#13;
abstraction as well as licenses for the return of water to the river basin are necessary to&#13;
address allocation problems. Water reuse, time of use, and quality of water should all be&#13;
reflected in water pricing. Establishment of an Upper Fen River Basin Corporation&#13;
(UFRBC) is thus envisioned under the project, with responsibility for regulatory&#13;
functions such as management and administration of a unified licensing and charging&#13;
system in Shanxi Province for the Fen River.&#13;
5.26  Reforms in financial aspects other than the pricing system are also required. All&#13;
water resource and supply institutions and enterprises, to different degrees, should&#13;
strengthen their financial viability by gaining better skills in financial, operational, and&#13;
capital investment planning, having power to borrow and invest, having rights to propose&#13;
tariff adjustment, retaining any revenue surplus for future use, and having the power to&#13;
hire and fire.&#13;
5.27  Along with institutional and financial reforms, transition from  the current&#13;
reporting systems to a unified reporting system in line with international accounting&#13;
practices is needed not only for project monitoring but also for better analysis of financial&#13;
and operating performance.  All water sector institutions and enterprises, whether&#13;
involved in construction or operation, should be able to provide easily understandable&#13;
financial reports or consolidated accounts.&#13;
5.28  Terms of reference for the proposed institutional study and financial strengthening&#13;
are presented in Annex 8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATIONS AND RISK&#13;
A. GENERAL&#13;
6.1   The primary motivation for Phase I of the proposed project is to alleviate severe&#13;
water shortages in Shanxi's Province's capital and main industrial center Taiyuan, and its&#13;
surrounding areas.&#13;
6.2   In 1993, water demands were estimated to be 33.5 percent greater than water&#13;
available from sustainable local supplies. By 2000, the deficit will be 50 percent and&#13;
continue to grow thereafter. Current water deficits in Taiyuan constrain economic growth&#13;
and employment, and limit Shanxi's ability to export coal, industrial products, and&#13;
electricity. Since much of the existing industrial capacity will be idled without sufficient&#13;
water supplies by the year 2000, relaxing this constraint for industry alone generates&#13;
sufficient economic benefits to justify the project.&#13;
6.3    Water shortages also  inflict hardships on  municipal consumers, create&#13;
environmental damage as the groundwater is depleted, and hamper the ability of farmers&#13;
to meet agricultural demands. Municipal consumers suffer from periodic interruptions of&#13;
service and perpetually low water pressures. Many people living above the third floor are&#13;
continually without water. Groundwater has been overextracted by 15 percent or more&#13;
every year since 1990. This exploitation has led to rapidly falling water tables (reaching&#13;
145 m in some places), a growing cone of depression under Taiyuan City and increasing&#13;
incidences of land subsidence. The proposed project water would halt overextraction of&#13;
groundwater and permit a gradual natural replenishment of the aquifers. No attempt was&#13;
made to measure these environmental benefits. Between 1987 and 1993, farmers in the&#13;
Taiyuan project area saw their irrigation supplies decline from 207 million m3 to 68&#13;
million. In part, this was due to water tables dropping below their capacity to pump, but&#13;
mostly the water was transferred to industrial uses, either voluntarily through sales or&#13;
involuntarily. The Project would preserve farmers' rights to their local water supplies,&#13;
and provide them with increased supplies of treated waste and sewage water for use in&#13;
irrigating crops.&#13;
B. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
6.4   Water Demand Projections. The benefits from increased water supplies depend&#13;
in large part on the estimates of future water demand. Recent statistical evidence&#13;
suggests that the water demand projections presented in Chapter 2 may be too&#13;
conservative.2 Those projections assumed an urban population growth rate of 1.2 percent&#13;
2 Those projections were made by local Project staff and the Tianjin Design Institute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
between 1993 and 2000, whereas the growth in 1993-95 was nearly 3 percent per year.&#13;
They also projected the growth in industrial capacity at 8 percent to 2000, whereas recent&#13;
growth has been about twice that. The appraisal mission in 1996 produced a revised set&#13;
of water demand projections for household and municipal (H&amp;M) demand, as well as&#13;
industrial demands, based on more recent trends, and careful forecasts worked out by the&#13;
Taiyuan Water Company. The revised projections include a breakdown into three cases:&#13;
"low" (which produces results similar to the earlier projections), "medium" (the most&#13;
likely case), and "high". In the medium case, urban population grows at 2.1 percent from&#13;
1995 to 2000, then slows to 1.4 percent. Industrial capacity grows at 10 percent from&#13;
1995 to 2000, then slows to 7.5 percent and 5 percent in the following decades. The&#13;
results of these new projections are summarized in Table 6.1.&#13;

6.5   Increased Human Consumption.3 Per capita urban consumption in Taiyuan was&#13;
91 liters/capita/day (l/c/d) in 1993 compared to the average for large Chinese cities of&#13;
210 l/c/d. A recent survey found that in half of households, per capita consumption was&#13;
less than 40 l/c/d. The project will permit urban consumption to reach China-wide norms&#13;
of 200 l/c/d by the year 2000. Water supplies will be available thereafter to parallel the&#13;
increase in population. It is estimated that urban consumption will increase by nearly 50&#13;
percent between 1993 and 2000.&#13;
6.6    Typically, willingness-to-pay (WTP) is used to measure the economic benefits to&#13;
increased urban consumption. WTP for urban water is observed to be about Y 1.8/m3 in&#13;
some coastal cities of China and is projected to be Y 4.3/mi3 in Taiyuan by 2002.&#13;
However, WTP is only valid for small increments in the water supply not for the large&#13;
changes that the proposed project will engender. Instead, a more conservative measure of&#13;
benefits, consumers' surplus (CS) is used. CS has been estimated from consumer&#13;
3 Includes consumption by commerce also.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
demand functions to be Y 2.5/m3 for Taiyuan in 2000, rising to 4.5 in 2020. These&#13;
economic values are lower than the amortized cost of project water, but the increased&#13;
supplies generate unmeasured social benefits.&#13;
6.7    Benefits from Increased Industrial Consumption. Shanxi industries have made&#13;
heroic efforts to conserve water. Shanxi industries surpassed China-wide norms for the&#13;
year 2000 for recycling in 1991 and achieved an 84.3 percent recycling rate in 1993.&#13;
Production function analysis shows that most investment in Shanxi industries in recent&#13;
years went toward increasing the productivity of water. Yet water remains the overriding&#13;
constraint on industry. It is estimated that 1993 industrial output could have been Y 6.5&#13;
billion greater (22 percent) had there been no water shortage. Factories have been&#13;
observed to shut down periodically when water is not available.&#13;
6.8    Given an alleviation of the water shortage, Shanxi industrial capacity will&#13;
continue to grow based on the natural resource endowment and location of the province.&#13;
With additional water, annual industrial output is projected to increase by 75 percent&#13;
between 1993 and 2000. Without additional water, output is likely to stagnate near&#13;
current levels. Table 2.7 showed projected industrial output with and without the Project.&#13;
6.9   The benefits from the water delivered to mines and industries by the proposed&#13;
project are based on the increase in industrial economic value added4 due to the water&#13;
delivered. A simple calculation based on average value added per unit of water shows&#13;
that the return to water might be as high as Y 67/m3.  But the calculation is not&#13;
straightforward, since the benefits vary by industrial sector, by project area (because the&#13;
sectoral mix is different), by future year, and by degree of underutilized existing&#13;
industrial capacity. The calculations are further complicated by the fact that Shanxi&#13;
industries are highly interdependent: the power sector buys a great deal of coal, without&#13;
which additional water would have little impact on power production and hence&#13;
economic value added. By using a linear programming model derived from a Shanxi&#13;
input-output model, the measures of additional value added per unit of water shown in&#13;
Table 6.2 were obtained.&#13;
6.10   These values represent benefits applying to unutilized (because of water shortage)&#13;
industrial capacity beginning in 2000. After 2000, benefits will slowly decline to the&#13;
perceived long-run cost of water, which we assume to be about 5.8-the announced&#13;
future price of water to industries in Taiyuan. By 2029, all plant in existence in 2000 will&#13;
have been replaced with modern technology based on the 5.8 price, and benefits from&#13;
project water will have fallen to that level. It should be noted that this technology will be&#13;
far more conserving of water than that currently in operation, largely based on the&#13;
assumption of free water.&#13;
4 Economic value added is the sum of payments to factors of production (labor, capital, etc.) adjusted&#13;
where necessary for distortions due to taxes, subsidies, and/or price controls.&#13;

6.12    Benefits to Farmers.  Irrigated farming can be quite profitable near the large&#13;
cities if high-valued fruits and vegetables are grown. But average returns to irrigation are&#13;
quite low  at about Y 2/m3, which explains why farmers sometimes sell their water to&#13;
industry. The proposed project water will be far too expensive to use for irrigation&#13;
directly. Nevertheless, farmers in the project areas will stand to benefit indirectly. First,&#13;
their shares of both surface and groundwater will be preserved at current levels. Second,&#13;
the subsidence of water tables due to overextraction will cease. Currently, water tables&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
are dropping toward levels at which farm pumps may cease to operate. Over time, water&#13;
tables should again rise to stable depths, making it easier for farmers to access&#13;
groundwater. Third, there will be vastly greater supplies of treated sewage and industrial&#13;
waste water available for irrigation. The planned schedule of water treatment allows the&#13;
volumes shown in column 4 of Table 6.3 to become available to farmers in the project&#13;
area and those downstream in the Fen River Basin.&#13;
6.13   Economic benefits of irrigation water supplies are estimated to be Y 4.0/mi3 within&#13;
the Taiyuan Project Area and Y 1.2/mi3 downstream. The former area has higher returns&#13;
because the water transport distances are shorter (lower losses) and it has a higher&#13;
percentage of high-valued fruits and vegetables in its cropping pattern. The projected&#13;
supplies of irrigation water shown in Table 6.2 receive primary and secondary treatment,&#13;
or oxidation ponding. Priority will likely be given to farmers in the Taiyuan Project area,&#13;
up to the limit of their demands of 108 million m3/year. The remaining water will be&#13;
released to the Fen River for use by irrigators below Taiyuan. It has been verified that&#13;
downstream shortages in irrigation water are sufficiently large to absorb these volumes.&#13;
The use of the treated water in this manner will ultimately double the incomes of farm&#13;
families receiving it.&#13;
C. PRICES, TARIFFS, AND COST RECOVERY&#13;
6.14 The investment costs, including physical contingencies, and operation and&#13;
maintenance costs have been taken into account in estimating the economic costs of the&#13;
project. Economic O&amp;M costs include electricity (valued at Y 0.35/kWh),5 management,&#13;
maintenance, overhaul and repair, and replacement costs of pumps and other equipment, all&#13;
expressed as economic values. Locally supplied components were evaluated at an exchange&#13;
rate of Y 8.3 to $1. Agricultural labor has been valued at Y 10 per day, the prevailing&#13;
market rate in the region. World Bank commodity price projections (1996) are used to&#13;
estimate farm-gate economic prices in constant 1995 terms for traded outputs and inputs.&#13;
6.15   The economic capital costs of water transfer from the project are Y 4.5/m3. The&#13;
financial costs are Y 4.86/m3. These levels, however, are far above present water tariffs&#13;
ranging from Y 1.0/mi3 for households to Y 1.2/m3 for industries.  As described in&#13;
Annex 7, the economic and social returns from Project water are sufficient to justify&#13;
tariffs that will result in full cost recovery. Accordingly, the Shanxi Province Price&#13;
Bureau has taken steps to increase water tariffs in Taiyuan in a stepwise fashion, so that&#13;
residential consumers will be paying Y 3.66/m3 by 2000, and industries, Y 5.78/m3,&#13;
averaging Y 4.94/mi3 (see Table 5.1). These levels have been justified through WTP&#13;
analysis (on the part of households) and financial profit analysis (for industries). They&#13;
will not only ensure full cost recovery, but provide incentives for more efficient water&#13;
use. Farmers who use treated wastewater from the project will be required to pay&#13;
Y 0.5/m3 to recover treatment and distribution costs.&#13;

D. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
6.16  Project investment (main works, water treatment and water supply networks for&#13;
Taiyuan City), incremental operation and management cost streams, and benefits streams&#13;
are presented in Annex 7. Based on the assumptions contained in these cost and benefit&#13;
streams and a 50-year project life, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the&#13;
project, excluding water treatment, is estimated to be 22.0 percent. The net present value&#13;
discounted at 12 percent (to 1995) is Y 10,316 million. Increased urban consumption&#13;
generates 7 percent of these benefits, and industrial consumption 85 percent and irrigation&#13;
10 percent. These returns exclude any difficult-to-measure environmental benefits from&#13;
the elimination of groundwater mining, and from the removal of health risks associated&#13;
with inadequate urban water supply.&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS&#13;
6.17  The project would improve the economic potential and living conditions in the&#13;
most economically productive region of Shanxi Province.  This region is already&#13;
critically short of water for virtually all human development needs including (a) domestic&#13;
(b) industrial, and (c) agricultural needs. The project produced water will be used first for&#13;
residential purposes to meet consumer demands for drinking water, second for industries&#13;
to maintain and increase output and employment, and third for agriculture to maintain&#13;
and improve productivity. It is also planned to reduce the use of freshwater resources for&#13;
agriculture by substituting use of treated sewage effluents. In addition, the project-&#13;
produced water will reduce pressures on groundwater resources, already very serious and&#13;
causing serious economic/socioeconomic losses to all affected community sectors. The&#13;
reduction in groundwater use will also have important effects on small streams in&#13;
maintaining year-round flow and restoring the aquatic ecology. The project will also&#13;
make major strides to reduce pollution in the Fen River and thereby make more water&#13;
available for municipal purposes downstream.&#13;
6.18  The argument may be made that the project favors the socioeconomics of the&#13;
urbanized target areas, which are less poor than the rural areas. This is true, but it is these&#13;
target areas that are of prime importance to the macro economy and socioeconomic&#13;
standards of the entire province. The huge increase in industrial employment anticipated&#13;
with the project (Table 6.4) will obviously represent the main opportunity for masses of&#13;
farm youth to escape poverty. Also, where reservoirs are to be built as part of the project,&#13;
it is planned that the resettled rural farmers will be benefited, that is, their housing and&#13;
income levels will be improved as a result of the resettlement.&#13;
F. EMPLOYMENT AND INCOMES&#13;
6.19  Industries in the Taiyuan Project Area generated about 744,600 jobs in 1994, with&#13;
a total wage bill of Y 3,253 million. Table 6.4 shows the projected path of employment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
and incomes with and without the project.6 In addition, farmers in the project area and&#13;
downstream will generate approximately Y 1,250 million of agricultural output from the&#13;
use of project wastewater, with associated gains of 35,000 person-years of employment&#13;
and Y 400 million of farm incomes.&#13;

G. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.20   The proposed project faces a variety of risks which could affect its performance.&#13;
These fall under the general headings: physical, finance, implementation and operational&#13;
risks, institutional/policy risks, environmental/long-term sustainability and economic.&#13;
Each type of risk is discussed in turn. Where possible, the economic cash flow model is&#13;
used to estimate the impact on the project's performance of a failure to avert the risk, and&#13;
the results summarized in Table 6.5 below.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
6.21   The major physical risks involve construction mishaps and delays and seismic&#13;
events, which could destroy the tunnels and connecting works. Construction risks are&#13;
deemed to be within manageable limits given close supervision by foreign and Chinese&#13;
experts. Nevertheless, a 10 percent cost increase has been included in the base case cash&#13;
flow model. The probability of an earthquake of a sufficient magnitude (7.0 Richter&#13;
scale) to damage the works is estimated to be less than 0.01 percent over the construction&#13;
period. As shown in Table 6.5, a 50 percent increase in construction costs (after 1996)&#13;
would still yield a rate of return of 16.3 percent, and a two-year delay in obtaining any&#13;
benefits would still produce a 16.3 percent return.&#13;
6.22   An additional concern is that future flows in the Yellow River may be insufficient&#13;
to supply the Project's diversions. A simulation over the 56 years of available hydrologic&#13;
data showed that sufficient water will be available in all months and all years if upstream&#13;
diversions are held to currently agreed provincial allocation limits.&#13;
6.23   Financing risks arise from the finance scheme, which relies on general revenues&#13;
for only 10 percent of cofinancing, with the remainder from special taxation of water,&#13;
electricity and coal. The taxation scheme is already functioning and generating the&#13;
revenues projected for it, and there has been no reported resistance to it on the part of the&#13;
major coal and power producers. The impacts of a shortfall in any of the finance&#13;
components would be equivalent to a physical risk resulting in a one-year delay in project&#13;
benefits, and is deemed manageable.&#13;
6.24  Implementation and operational risks involve failures to deliver the needed&#13;
volumes of water in a timely fashion. To prepare for the complexities of implementing&#13;
and operating the project, YRDPB was established at an early stage, and staffed with&#13;
carefully selected local experts. The staff has been supplemented by foreign consultants&#13;
who will continue to assist and oversee the operation. A failure in implementation and&#13;
operation resulting in a one-year delay in achieving benefits would reduce the IRR from&#13;
22 percent to 18.8 percent. A continuing operational problem that would result in 20&#13;
percent lower water deliveries throughout the life of the project would reduce the IRR to&#13;
15.6 percent (Table 6.5).&#13;
6.25  Institutional/policy risks involve resistance to the proposed water tariff structure&#13;
or other factors that would result in low or uneven water fee collections. Such failures&#13;
would adversely affect the locally-financed component (see above).  If the water&#13;
authorities fail to charge the same price for all water of the same quality (project water&#13;
and existing ground and surface water), then the latter sources will continue to be&#13;
overexploited, and the demand for project water will be less than projected. This type of&#13;
risk is being addressed through strict water pricing covenants covering all water sources.&#13;
6.26   Environmental/sustainability risks would arise from a failure to adequately treat&#13;
and reuse incremental industrial waste and sewage water facilitated by the project. Such&#13;
a failure would result in environmental damage downstream of Taiyuan, and to the entire&#13;
lower reach of the Yellow River. Covenants to be negotiated would ensure that releases&#13;
to the Fen and Yellow rivers will be within safe levels according to Chinese&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
environmental standards. There is also a significant economic and income-distributional&#13;
benefit to treatment and reuse. Without this component the IRR would fall from 22.0&#13;
percent to 20.6 percent.&#13;
6.27  The major economic risks associated with the project are related to the projections&#13;
of industrial output and water demand by firms in the project areas. A lengthy economic&#13;
depression in China could cause the demand for Shanxi exports to fall and thereby reduce&#13;
the need for WWTP water. However, even under the "Low" assumptions about&#13;
economic growth (8 percent until 2000, then 5 percent), the rate of return is still above 18&#13;
percent. The "Low" growth rate is about half of Shanxi's recent experience.&#13;
6.28  Several other critical assumptions in the EIRR analysis were tested for sensitivity.&#13;
These tests are summarized in Table 6.5. In each case, the economic performance of the&#13;
project remains acceptable. The project would remain viable even if a combination of&#13;
unforeseen cost increases and delays should occur. If all post-1996 construction costs&#13;
should increase by 50 percent, operating costs increase by 50 percent, and all benefits&#13;
were delayed one year, the EIRR would still be 12.3 percent and the cost-benefit ratio&#13;
would be above 1.&#13;
H. PROJECT AFFORDABILITY&#13;
6.29  The proposed project water will be significantly more expensive than any water&#13;
source used in the project area to date. In 1993, industrial consumers paid an average of&#13;
Y l.1/m3 and urban residents, Y 0.7/mi3. Local authorities have already begun to increase&#13;
water prices, with the objective by the year of 2000 of Y 5.8/m3 for industrial users,&#13;
Y 3.66 for urban residents, and Y 0.6 to Y 1.5 for irrigators. The price structure was&#13;
designed to recover project costs as well as take into consideration the ability-to-pay of&#13;
consumers.&#13;
6.30  With the eventual prices in place, will the consumers be able to afford project&#13;
water? In the case of industrial users, the answer is unequivocally yes. Input-output&#13;
analysis has shown that marginal financial returns to all industries combined was about&#13;
3                                                            3&#13;
Y 20/mi in 1990, and rising rapidly. By 2000, it will be in the range of Y 50/mr.&#13;
6.31   Farm budget analysis has shown that the marginal returns to irrigation are in the&#13;
range of Y 1.1 to Y 5/m3 or more and have been rising recently as agricultural commodity&#13;
prices have increased. Even with the higher prices projected, irrigation charges will still&#13;
amount to only 6 percent of farm budgets in 2000 for grain production, and 20 percent for&#13;
vegetables.&#13;
6.32  Urban residents may be the most likely group to suffer from the increased water&#13;
charges since their costs are scheduled to increase fivefold over 1993 levels. However,&#13;
household budget information reveals that only 0.4 percent of household income went for&#13;
water in 1993, and this will rise to only 0.75 percent in 2000 with the higher water tariffs&#13;
and projected income increases. Under the unlikely possibility of no increase in urban&#13;
incomes, water would still comprise only about 2 percent of household budgets.&#13;

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1   During negotiations, assurances were obtained from:&#13;
(a)   the Borrower that it will prepare, by December 31, 1998, a satisfactory&#13;
maintenance program and an emergency preparedness plan for the dam.&#13;
Also, the Borrower will employ independent experts with qualifications,&#13;
experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to inspect the dam,&#13;
associated works and structures regularly starting October 31, 1998,&#13;
according to sound engineering practices, to determine if any of the&#13;
structural conditions, maintenance or operating methods could endanger&#13;
safety. Inspections would be conducted annually for the first five years of&#13;
operations and every three years thereafter (para. 3.6);&#13;

and structures, according to sound engineering practices. This would be&#13;
done to determine if any of the structures, maintenance or operating methods&#13;
are deficient and may compromise their safety. Shanxi will biannually&#13;
submit the experts' reports to the Bank, starting with the first report by&#13;
November 15, 1998 (para. 3.13);&#13;
(d)   Shanxi that it will establish through Taiyuan an SMO with terms of&#13;
reference, staffing and other resources acceptable to the Bank by&#13;
December 31, 1997 to appraise subprojects, provide subloans and&#13;
supervise, monitor, and report on subprojects in accordance with an&#13;
operations manual's procedures and on terms and conditions satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank (para. 3.33);&#13;

activities would be implemented as planned in a program acceptable to the&#13;
Bank so as to be completed by June 30, 2002. Shanxi will provide the&#13;
Bank on a semiannual basis (by each April 15 and October 15) details of&#13;
the designs, financing and construction progress for Taiyuan water supply&#13;
and sewerage plans implemented in the preceding semester and plans for&#13;
construction for the 12 months ahead (para. 3.42);&#13;
(f)    YRDPC  will employ  by  September 15, 1997  an  independent&#13;
environment/resettlement panel of experts to review and make&#13;
recommendations with respect to the EMP. Further, it shall maintain an&#13;
Environmental Management Office with competent staff in adequate&#13;
numbers and with responsibilities and functions acceptable to the Bank to&#13;
manage, coordinate and monitor the EMP. Also, it shall ensure that all&#13;
activities under the project will comply with the EMP (para. 3.49);&#13;
(g)   Shanxi that resettlement agencies at the provincial, county and township&#13;
levels will carry out the resettlement under the project according to the&#13;
RAP. YRDPC will (a) also carry out resettlement according to the RAP;&#13;
(b) employ an independent monitoring institution by September 15, 1997,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, to evaluate the socioeconomic progress of those&#13;
affected by resettlement; (c) employ an independent panel of environment/&#13;
resettlement experts by September 15, 1997, satisfactory to the Bank, to&#13;
review the resettlement semiannually (see para. 3.49); (d) promptly furnish&#13;
to the Bank, for comment, reports of the findings and recommendations of&#13;
both groups; and (e) implement all recommendations for follow-up&#13;
actions, taking account of the Bank's comments (para. 3.57);&#13;
(h)   YRDPC would submit to the Bank by December 15 of each year the&#13;
financing plan and the proposed implementation program for the next year&#13;
as approved by the Government, and thereafter implement this program,&#13;
taking into account the Bank's views on it (para. 3.65);&#13;
(i)   Shanxi that it would onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan (other than for&#13;
the Institutional Support Program for Shanxi Government) to YRDPC,&#13;
under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20-year term, including 5 years&#13;
of grace at the same interest rate and commitment fee as those paid by the&#13;
Borrower. The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between Shanxi&#13;
and YRDPC, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness of the loan (para. 3.66);&#13;
(j)    YRDPC shall, by April 30 of each year and for three years after&#13;
completion of the project, furnish to the Bank an annual monitoring report,&#13;
in a format acceptable to the Bank, covering all components of the project,&#13;
in conformance with the agreed monitoring indicators.  In addition,&#13;
YRDPC will provide semiannual progress reports by April 15 and October&#13;

Institutional Reform and Water Pollution Control and Industrial Waste&#13;
Management) that they would maintain separate accounts for the project and&#13;
that the audited project accounts of Shanxi and the audited financial&#13;
statements of YRDPC and Shanxi Government would be furnished to the&#13;
Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal year (para. 3.79);&#13;
(1)    YRDPC will maintain its project management office with competent staff&#13;
in adequate numbers and it will have responsibility and functions&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.3);&#13;
(m)   YRDPC will continue to employ an Engineer with qualifications,&#13;
experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank in order to&#13;
undertake the construction supervision (para. 4.5);&#13;
(n)   YRDPC that it will employ a POE by September 30, 1997 that is&#13;
independent from the project's designers; that the POE will conduct, at&#13;
least twice annually or more frequently as needed, reviews of designs and&#13;
technical specifications and advise on unforeseen problems relating to&#13;
project implementation, and that YRDPC will report the POE's findings to&#13;
the Bank and Borrower on a semiannual basis (para. 4.8);&#13;
(o)   YRDPC will prepare under guidelines acceptable to the Bank and furnish&#13;
to the Bank a program by June 30, 1999 for smooth transformation of&#13;
YRDPC from a construction entity to an operating entity and thereafter&#13;
will implement this plan, taking into account the Bank's comments on this&#13;
matter. The plan will have details of the new organizational structure,&#13;
staffing numbers and qualifications, and training programs for staff to&#13;
make the transition (para. 4.16);&#13;
(p)   Shanxi that each year incremental revenues from tariff adjustments and&#13;
increased water resources fees between 1997 and 2001 will be allocated to&#13;
YRDPC by December 31 of that year as a capital contribution to YRDPC&#13;
(para. 5.9);&#13;
(q)   Shanxi that it would prepare, on the basis of guidelines acceptable to the&#13;
Bank: (a) a program by February 15, 1998 to ensure that, by June 30,&#13;
2002, self-supplied groundwater would have the same tariffs as for all&#13;
other water supplied in Shanxi; and (b) a program by June 15, 1998 to&#13;
ensure that groundwater extraction would also be limited to safe yield&#13;
levels. Shanxi would thereafter implement these programs, taking into&#13;
account the Bank's comments on them(para. 5.18); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
(r)    YRDPC and Shanxi Province that financial performance indices for&#13;
YRDPC and TMWC's water supply operations will meet the following&#13;
requirements:&#13;
(i)    YRDPC would take all measures, including but not limited to tariff&#13;
adjustments, to ensure a debt service coverage ratio of no less than&#13;
1.2 throughout the whole debt repayment period (2003-16), and a&#13;
rate of return on two-year average notionally revalued net fixed&#13;
assets in service of no less than 2 percent for year 2011-16.&#13;
(ii)   Shanxi Province would cause TMWC to take all measures,&#13;
including but not limited to tariff adjustments, to ensure that (1)&#13;
debt/equity ratio is better than 70/30 between 1997 and 2001; (2) a&#13;
debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.2 is achieved between&#13;
2002 and 2016 when YRDPC is paying off its subsidiary loan; and&#13;
(3) a rate of return on two-year notionally revalued net fixed assets&#13;
in service of no less than 2 percent is achieved for the same period&#13;
of 2002 and thereafter (para. 5.20).&#13;
7.2   Subject to the foregoing, the proposed project would be suitable for a US Dollar&#13;
single currency Bank loan of $400 million to the People's Republic of China. The loan&#13;
would be for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the Bank's&#13;
standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar denominated single currency loans.&#13;

D. CONTROLS AND AUTOMATION&#13;
It is understood that the major tasks of the control and automation systems are:&#13;
* Flow Control&#13;
* Economic Flow Dispatching&#13;
* Systemwide Normal Starting and Stopping&#13;
* Automation Operation Schemes and Coordination for Emergency Events&#13;
* Operation Monitoring&#13;
* Water Pricing&#13;
Control Levels&#13;
A three-level control and automation structure is a good approach for the project.&#13;
This concept is supported by the World Bank Team. The major functionality of the three&#13;
control levels is summarized as follows:&#13;
Level One (local or Pump Unit Level) Control&#13;
- Signal unit starting and stopping&#13;
* Automatic actions in case of a local emergency&#13;
3 Data collection and transmission to Level Two and Three&#13;
Level Two (Control/Pumping Station Level) Control&#13;
* Management of pump units: operating, maintenance, standby, if the control&#13;
station is local at pump station.&#13;
* Gate and valve control&#13;
* Display important information at local control centers&#13;
* Data collection and transmission to Level Three&#13;
* Logs and reports printing for local usage&#13;
* Allowing operators to perform some "remote control" functions.&#13;
Level Three (Diversion or Central Dispatching Level ) Control&#13;
* Management of the whole hydraulic network&#13;
* Remote control of key equipment&#13;
* Major emergency response schemes&#13;
* Global status information of all important equipment&#13;
* Operation planning and dispatching strategy&#13;
* Systemwide key information display&#13;
* Data treatment, storage, analysis and statistics&#13;
* Logs and reports printing for diversion usage&#13;

PART 2: COMPLEMENTARY WORKS: TAIYUAN CITY&#13;
1.    Taiyuan Municipality (area 7,000 kM2, population 2.6 millions in 1991) comprises&#13;
three urban districts (the City proper), two suburban districts, three counties and the Gujiao&#13;
City. Most of the population (about 1.8 million), is concentrated in Taiyuan City (170 km2)&#13;
and in the suburban districts. [These are also an estimated 300,000 "temporary" residents,&#13;
i.e., people without official residence permits living and working in the main urban areas.]&#13;
The area is heavily industrialized (coal mining, power generation, steel, heavy machinery&#13;
and chemicals). About 85 percent of industry is concentrated in Taiyuan City, about 10&#13;
percent is located in the northern outskirts and 4 percent in Gujiao. In 1993 there was about&#13;
23,600 ha of irrigated agriculture in the Municipal area. This annex reviews the current&#13;
situation for both water supply and wastewater in Taiyuan and goes on to identify the works&#13;
that will be required and are being planned to efficiently utilize the transferred water. The&#13;
concomitant institutional and operational improvements necessary and the associated&#13;
financing plans are also discussed.&#13;
A. WATER SUPPLY&#13;
2.    Water Agencies. The Municipality has in place a number of agencies responsible&#13;
for water supply, including:&#13;
(a)   the Taiyuan Municipal Water Company (TMWC), which provides water to&#13;
some 1.45 million people and industries in the main urban areas covering&#13;
about  O0 km;&#13;
(b)   the Municipal Water Resources Management Commission, which provides&#13;
water to the suburban districts and the counties, as well as the power and&#13;
steel industries, and for agriculture;&#13;
(c)   the Gujiao Water Supply Company; and&#13;
(d)   industries that operate their own sources (around 558 wells) serving both&#13;
industrial and domestic needs.&#13;
The Tianjin Investigation and Design Institute (TIDI), consultants to The Yellow River&#13;
Development Project (YRDP), has carried out comprehensive studies of the water resources&#13;
available to the Municipality as a whole, and has prepared water demand forecasts. The&#13;
Southwest Municipal Engineering Design and Research Institute of China (SMEDRIC) has&#13;
prepared prefeasibility studies for the water supply works required to utilize project water,&#13;
and has also prepared forecasts of demand and resources available for the city area.&#13;
3.    Present Water Resources. Both surface water and groundwater are used within&#13;
the Municipality, although the latter dominates (over 80 percent) for municipal/domestic&#13;
and industrial uses. Groundwater abstractions are estimated by the Municipal Water&#13;
Resources Commission to be 960,000 m3/day (350 million m3/year) compared to a safe&#13;
yield (estimated by TIDI) of 840,000 m3/day (307 million m3/year).  Most of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                     ANNEX I&#13;
overabstraction is in the urban area, where current (1994) abstraction rates are about&#13;
650,000 m3/day, compared with an estimated safe yield of around 410,000 m3/day&#13;
(SMEDRIC). Groundwater levels have declined by some 2 to 3 m per year, natural springs&#13;
and wells have dried up and local ground subsidence has occurred, in some areas of the city.&#13;
Coal mining activities compound these problems. Abstraction depths are over 200 m in the&#13;
south of the city, but less to the north (around 120 m). Unless alternate sources of water are&#13;
developed, the City will face a declining level of urban and industrial activity, under use of&#13;
land, energy and mineral resources, increase in environmental pollution and lower living&#13;
standards.&#13;
4.    Groundwater abstraction is regulated through a renewable (five years) permit&#13;
system, instituted in 1993. All requests for new wells are subject to review and approval by&#13;
the Municipal Water Resources Commission. Wells are metered and allocated abstraction&#13;
quotas by the Water Saving Office of the Urban Construction Commission (UCC). Heavy&#13;
fines are imposed for overabstraction.  However, basic abstraction charges are low&#13;
(Y 0.11 /m3 for industry and Y 0.10 for domestic users). TMWC is exempt from these&#13;
charges. Per capita supply for domestic/municipal uses in 1993 was around 120 liters/day,&#13;
of which residential use was 70 liters/day, as estimated by TMWC. These are among the&#13;
lowest in the nation. In some areas, residential use is even less, due to local supply&#13;
constraints. Estimated uses and sources of water in the Municipality and in the TMWC&#13;
service area in 1993 are summarized in Table I below.&#13;

5.    TMWC serves the main urban and industrial area and operates nine water&#13;
distribution/treatment plants and five booster pump stations. TMWC sources are dominated&#13;
by three major well fields: Lan Cun (300,000 m3/day); Xi Zhang (70,000 m3/day); and&#13;
Zaogou (70,000 m3/day). TMWC has other, minor, active sources totaling 23,000 m3/day.&#13;
Total supply by the water company in 1993 averaged around 415,000 m3/day (151 million&#13;
m 3/year), with annual sales of 140 million m 3/year, of which an estimated 53 million m3&#13;
were domestic/municipal, 10 million m3 institutional and 77 million m3 industrial/&#13;
commercial. Supply in 1994 increased to 420,000 m3/day. About 240 factories have their&#13;
own supply systems, abstracting groundwater (serving both industrial and domestic uses)&#13;
from around 558 wells. In 1993, abstractions totaled 270,000 m3/day (98 million m3/year),&#13;
rising to 290,000 m3/day in 1994. The Water Savings Office estimates that 40 percent of&#13;
water abstracted by factories is used for domestic purposes for workers living on the factory&#13;
site. Industry is reported to reuse about 30,000 m /day (11 million m3/year) after treatment,&#13;
and the power and steel industries use about 90,000 m3/day (33 million m3/year) of surface&#13;
water abstracted from the East and West irrigation canals, which pass through the city.&#13;
6.    Water Treatment Facilities, Distribution System and Supply Zones. Water&#13;
abstracted from the wells is generally of good quality. Treatment of groundwater comprises&#13;
chlorination conforming with national standards. Water quality is tested both by TMWC&#13;
and by the Public Health Bureau. Treatment for industrial self-supplies presumably reflect&#13;
end use (i.e., disinfected for domestic use; untreated for basic industrial uses). Surface&#13;
waters abstracted by the power station and steel mill are used, after settlement, as cooling&#13;
and wash water.&#13;
7.    TMWC serves three principal service areas in the City:  west, northeast and&#13;
southeast. Each of these areas have a number of subzones controlled by five booster pump&#13;
stations and seven forwarding stations at which additional disinfection is applied. The&#13;
system is designed to be pressurized by pumps, with no water towers or reservoirs. Some&#13;
enterprises have constructed their own storage facilities and many apartment blocks have&#13;
roof tanks. The shortage of water in some areas is attributable both to inadequate supply&#13;
and to deficiencies in the network. The western service area is fed from the Xi Zhang&#13;
wellfield, whereas the east bank is fed from both the Lan Cun and Zaogou wellfields.&#13;
Trunk mains from Xizhang are 700 and 900 mm dia. and from Lan Cun twin 1,000 mm dia.&#13;
pipes supplying the power station and steel mill, and an 1,100 mm dia. pipe supplying the&#13;
central city area; 600 and 700 mm dia. pipes from Zaogou connect to the Lan Cun trunk&#13;
mains. The Lan Cun source has the highest quality and is also the cheapest to operate&#13;
(lowest pumping head). It is thus generally used to provide the base load.&#13;
8.    Trunk mains are generally concrete or steel with cast iron secondary mains, now&#13;
between 10 and 30 years old. Tertiary distribution and house connections are generally&#13;
galvanized iron. Leakage, which forms almost all unaccounted-for water (UfW), is reported&#13;
to be only 6 to 7 percent, based on readings taken at "bulk" meters (there are 3,000 such&#13;
meters in the whole city and TMWC charging is based on readings at these). This does not&#13;
take account of downstream distribution losses and also reflects the low pressures within the&#13;
system. Losses per unit length of trunk main are estimated to be 44 m /km/day. The total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                      ANNEX I&#13;
UfW is estimated at 30 percent presently. The UfW is expected to be kept lower (about 20&#13;
percent) because of complete rehabilitation of the distribution system before 2001 (see&#13;
Table 4). In addition, it is planned to have a UfW study to identify the main sources of&#13;
UfW. Distribution is controlled by manual adjustment of valves and pumps. Information&#13;
on pressures at 20 monitoring points in the network is telemetered to the head office, from&#13;
where decisions on the dispatch of water are made. In view of the water shortage, parts of&#13;
the network are shut down in turn, to ensure that water is available to all areas in rotation.&#13;
Large enterprises, such as the Steel Mill and Chemical Works, have their own distribution&#13;
systems.&#13;
9.    Resource and System Management and Water Charges. There is an underlying&#13;
problem of a lack of overall coordinated resource management; the inability of TMWC to&#13;
deliver adequate supplies has led, in the urban area, to what is effectively a "free for all,"&#13;
with industrial, domestic and agricultural users competing for a dwindling supply of&#13;
groundwater. While the Municipal Water Resources Commission is attempting to control&#13;
the situation through the abstraction permit system, a more rational approach to the&#13;
conjunctive management of surface and groundwater is being developed. In particular,&#13;
further regulatory measures will need to be taken to curb and rationally allocate individual&#13;
groundwater abstractions, as this source will be cheaper than project water. As pressures in&#13;
the system are increased, water wastage and system losses could become significant. A&#13;
comprehensive water conservation, leak detection and prevention program is required.&#13;
Business and domestic users are metered as bulk supplies, with residents in an apartment&#13;
block, for example, being required to organize their own sharing of water charges. There&#13;
are around 330,000 domestic meters. As noted earlier, a groundwater abstraction charge is&#13;
collected from enterprises with their own wells. TMWC charges for treated water (1995)&#13;
are Y 1.1/m3 for business users and Y 0.7/m3 for domestic/municipal users and for&#13;
government institutions.&#13;
10.   Economic Growth and Water Demand Forecasts. Forecasts are prepared by the&#13;
Municipal Government and indicate significant growth in a number of areas. Principal&#13;
features are summarized in Table 2. Forecasts of water demand have been made both by&#13;
TIDI for the Municipality as a whole, and by SMEDRIC for the TMWC service area.&#13;
These forecasts are difficult to compare, as they are not based on the same assumptions.&#13;
Furthermore, while TIDI has focused on industrial and agricultural forecasts, with limited&#13;
attention to domestic/municipal demands, SMEDRIC has focused on domestic/municipal&#13;
demands with industrial demand forecasts being relatively crude and agricultural/rural&#13;
demands omitted. Clearly, the forecasts are intended for different purposes; TIDI's is&#13;
intended to provide an overall view of the projected municipal water balance, whereas&#13;
SMEDRIC's is intended as a guide to capacity requirements within TMWC's service area.&#13;
As the project water will be transferred to TMWC, the SMEDRIC forecasts have been&#13;
adopted for the planning of the treatment and distribution works. Detailed forecasts were&#13;
also prepared based on economic growth parameters and taking account of price elasticity&#13;
effects (see Annex 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                     ANNEX 1&#13;
11.   Water Distribution System. The SMEDRIC report compares the options of a&#13;
single water treatment plant at Huyan for all of the transferred water against one plant at&#13;
Huyan and a second nearer the city center, each treating part of the flow. The conclusion&#13;
reached is that a single plant at Huyan is the most cost-effective solution. The major part&#13;
of the city can be supplied by gravity from this location, although fringe areas require&#13;
pumping stations to boost supplies. The report reviews the use of three booster pump&#13;
stations compared to two, and concludes that two will provide the most economic&#13;
solution. Pipeline sizing has been optimized using a network analysis program provided&#13;
by Tongji University. Storage of 10 percent of daily capacity will be provided for&#13;
regulation purposes. A separate low quality supply of 56,000 m3/day for power station&#13;
No. 2 is provided by omitting some of the processes for part of the flow. The possibility&#13;
of supplying other industrial areas with low quality water has also been examined, both&#13;
for a complete dual distribution system for the whole city and also for a partial system for&#13;
the principal industrialized areas. The conclusion reached is that dual supplies, whether in&#13;
general or to targeted industrial areas, would add significantly to costs due to the&#13;
additional pipework required.&#13;

12.    It has been agreed that TMWC will be responsible for the treatment and distribution&#13;
of the whole of the project water resource delivered to Taiyuan and has signed a&#13;
memorandum of understanding with YRDPO to this effect. The new treatment works at&#13;
Huyan and associated distribution networks will present a new challenge for TMWC, both&#13;
in view of its size and the modem treatment technologies required. It will therefore be&#13;
important to ensure that technical assistance and training are provided, both for&#13;
management and systems design and O&amp;M. The conjunctive management of the existing&#13;
and future resources and system design will depend on the locations of major centers of&#13;
demand (particularly large industry), and the policy regarding the use of groundwater.&#13;
Groundwater abstractions in the urban area are predicted to reduce from around 650,000&#13;
m3/day in 1994 to 410,000 mr3/day in 2020. A rational approach to groundwater allocations&#13;
could result in significant cost savings, in terms of treatment capacity and pipework&#13;
required. A operational analysis using a dynamic computer network model is to be carried&#13;
out to assist in planning, design and specification of new works. SMEDRIC future resource&#13;
and demand forecasts are summarized in Table 3 below. The investigation of the upstream&#13;
connecting works by Shanxi Investigation and Design Institute for Water Resources (SIDI)&#13;
suggests an appropriate interim step in transfers. The timing of utilization of project&#13;
transfers can be reviewed, as demand develops, and it may be possible to surcharge the&#13;
treatment works should deficits develop in interim years while additional capacity is being&#13;
developed.&#13;

13.   Project Water Delivery aind Treatment. Water from the project tunnel will be&#13;
delivered at the new TMWC water treatment plant at Huyan at the north end of the City.&#13;
The Huyan treatment works will have an initial capacity of 1.0 million m3/day and an&#13;
ultimate capacity of 1.87 million m3/day. The treatment processes will take into account the&#13;
raw water quality-a varying mix of Yellow River water and local runoff, with high&#13;
turbidity and suspended solids, especially during the flood season. The SMEDRIC studies&#13;
recommend the following process: Presedimentation using open radial flow clarifiers with&#13;
provision for the addition of polymer coagulating agents; rapid mechanical mixing tanks for&#13;
coagulant dosing and pH adjustment; mechanical flocculators; rectangular, baffled&#13;
settlement tanks; conventional rapid gravity sand filters with air/water backwashing;&#13;
disinfection tanks for liquid chlorine and ammonia dosing; and treated water storage of 15&#13;
percent of the daily flow. TMWC are proposing to build the presedimentation tanks at the&#13;
Fen-1 reservoir site. These would only be operated during the flood season. Given that&#13;
the Fen-1 reservoir acts as a silt trap, the need for these tanks remains to be established,&#13;
following  further study  and  water quality  analysis.   The  requirements  for&#13;
presedimentation will be reviewed during the detailed design phase. Sludge generated by&#13;
the treatment processes is to be discharged to river under the current Phase 1 feasibility&#13;
design, with proper treatment facilities being provided in Phase 2. This decision will be&#13;
reviewed during the detailed design phase, in view of concerns over the environmental&#13;
acceptability of this proposal. A facility for the tapping of partially treated water for the&#13;
power station will be included in the works and would optimize treatment and distribution&#13;
costs. Computerized monitoring and control systems will be included for all the processes.&#13;
The coagulation, settlement and filtration processes will be enclosed, in view of the severe&#13;
winter temperatures: heating will also be necessary.   The SMEDRIC  design&#13;
recommendations will form the basis of the final designs now under preparation in&#13;
collaboration with Japanese OECF financing.&#13;

added or will replace existing systems (see Table 4 above). These will be cast iron&#13;
(400 mm and less), "improved" cast iron (up to 1,600 mm) or steel (for larger diameters).&#13;
Tertiary systems will also need to be expanded and renewed where appropriate. However,&#13;
final designs and programs will be based on dynamic network modeling to optimize&#13;
operations and take into account the revised Town Plan. A leakage detection and control&#13;
program  for which Terms of Reference will be agreed during the appraisal will be&#13;
implemented and will assist in detailed network planning, pipeline replacement and&#13;
conservation of water. A more strategic approach to system improvement, over a longer&#13;
time span, targeting specific supply zones and making best use of the capacity of the&#13;
existing systems may be appropriate. Network modeling will aid strategic planning and&#13;
programming and serve to optimize the design, assess operational characteristics, optimize&#13;
performance and examine the effects of conjunctive use of the project water and&#13;
groundwater supplies. Consideration also could be given to the provision of additional&#13;
storage over the 10 percent of daily supply now proposed, as a means of flow balancing,&#13;
and reducing pipe size requirements.&#13;

15.    Program, Financial Requirements and Proposals.  TMWC intends to utilize&#13;
project water as it becomes available from 2001 and preliminary cost estimates have been&#13;
made. Works that are planned to be completed by TMWC for Phase 1 and their costs,&#13;
including 8 percent physical contingencies (as estimated by SMEDRIC), are summarized in&#13;
Table 5. TMWC propose to finance these investments through a combination of national&#13;
funds and international loans (60 percent). TMWC is negotiating with Japanese financing&#13;
agencies (OECF) to secure finance for the Huyan treatment works. Local financing will be&#13;
raised from the Municipal Planning Commission, the Municipal Construction Commission,&#13;
the Provincial Government and from additional connection and supply charges, water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
resource fees and surcharges on current water consumption. The Japanese finance will be&#13;
provided through their OECF private sector facility, in a similar manner to that provided&#13;
for the Changchun Industrial Water Supply Project. Onlending will be through the Bank&#13;
of China. Under this arrangement, a joint venture (J/V) will be established between&#13;
private sector Japanese and Chinese companies to design, build and operate the works.&#13;
TMWC, along with 32 local investors from the state-owned and private business&#13;
community in Taiyuan, will form the Chinese company, which has applied for its&#13;
business license. Most of the mechanical and electrical components for the treatment&#13;
works and pumping stations will be procured from Japan. The Japanese Company will&#13;
not invest directly in the project, but will contribute to the design and construction of the&#13;
works, provide technical assistance with operation and maintenance for three years after&#13;
completion of construction, and then withdraw. The J/V will thus operate the plant for&#13;
three years, and then hand over to the Chinese partner to continue.  Water sales&#13;
agreements between the three parties (YRDPC, the J/V and TMWC) will be drawn up at&#13;
the same time as the financing and concession agreements.&#13;
B. WASTEWATER&#13;
16.   The Existing Water Environment. The Fen River deteriorates significantly in&#13;
quality as it passes through Taiyuan City. There are significant levels of pollution in the&#13;
river and its tributaries as a result of the numerous discharges of untreated and partially&#13;
treated domestic sewage and industrial wastes. This situation will only be improved with&#13;
the extension and upgrading of sewerage systems, and the expansion of treatment facilities&#13;
for domestic and industrial discharges. Wastewater discharges were estimated in 1993 to be&#13;
around 220 million m3, of which around half was of industrial origin. Most of this&#13;
wastewater is discharged to the Fen River, either through sewers or open ditches and&#13;
tributaries. Seventeen major enterprises contribute over 80 percent of the industrial volume,&#13;
the largest being the steel mill, the fertilizer plant, the two power stations, the chemicals&#13;
plant and the paper mill. Water quality measurements taken at seven sampling sites on the&#13;
Fen River in May 1993 (a typical low-flow situation), indicated that levels of chemical&#13;
oxygen demand (COD), phenol, ammonia, nitrates, chromium and cyanide were well above&#13;
acceptable standards. Samples taken in tributaries of the Fen River in April 1993 showed&#13;
similar problems.&#13;
17.   Drainage Areas. There are currently eight defined drainage areas in Taiyuan, as&#13;
described below. Most have separate stormwater and sanitary sewers, but the older,&#13;
downtown area has a combined system. The drainage areas are: (a) Shang Lan, a small&#13;
area (2.5 km ) to the north of the main city mainly serving the paper mill; (b) Bei Jiao in the&#13;
northeast of the city (23 km 2), which serves the Jing Yang and Xin Yang chemical works;&#13;
(c) the steel mill industrial and housing area (26 kmi2) in the northeast of the city; (d) the&#13;
main downtown area (34 kmi2) on the east bank; (e) Nan Jiao, the largely industrial area&#13;
(23 km2) in the southeast of the city; (f) He Xi North, the west bank of the city, northern&#13;
area (21 km2); (g) He Xi Central, the west bank of the city, central area (10 km2); and&#13;
(h) Nan Yan, the area (20 km2) in the southwest of the city, mainly serving the Taiyuan&#13;
Chemical Company's factories and the No. 2 Power Plant.&#13;

18.   Treatment Works. There are three municipal sewage treatment works (STWs), all&#13;
on the east side of the river: Bei Jiao in the north, Yang Jia Bao serving the central down&#13;
town area, and Ying Jia Bao in the south. In addition, there are two works serving&#13;
industrial plants and their cnvirons: Zhao Zhuang, serving Taiyuan Iron and Steel&#13;
Company on the east side of the river, and Nan Yan serving the chemical complex on the&#13;
west side. Key data are summarized in Table 6.&#13;

19.   Management and Financing of Operations. There are a number of fees for&#13;
sewerage services collected by the Water Saving Office on behalf of the Municipal&#13;
Government:  Y 0.1 0/mn3 from government institutions; Y 0.12/mi3 from industry and&#13;
commerce; and no charge for domestic connections. In addition, where an effluent from an&#13;
enterprise does not reach the standards laid down for discharge to sewer, a fine is collected&#13;
by the Monitoring Station of the Urban Engineering Management Bureau, depending on the&#13;
nature of the effluent and the damage caused. These fees are supplemented by revenue&#13;
from the sale of treated sewage effluent for reuse within industry, for which the rate was&#13;
Y 0.4/mi3 in 1995. A volume charge of Y 0.05/mi3 is also collected by the Environmental&#13;
Protection Bureau (EPB) from industrial users. EPB also imposes fines for discharges to&#13;
the environment that do not comply with the standards set. The reported operating costs for&#13;
sewage collection and treatment vary from Y 0.1 6/mn3 for a simple pumping station&#13;
discharging sewage to the river without treatment, to Y 0.22/m3 for treatment at Yang Jia&#13;
Bao and Y 0.74/m3 for treatment at Bei Jiao. Total income does not cover the costs of&#13;
providing the service, which is subsidized by the Municipal Government through an annual&#13;
budget provision, with all revenues collected being returned to Government. The budget for&#13;
1994 for operation of treatment works was around Y 9.4 million, whereas that for&#13;
maintenance of the sewerage network was Y 0.9 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
20.   The operation and maintenance of STWs is carried out by the Drainage&#13;
Management Section of the Urban Management Bureau, while the maintenance of sewers is&#13;
the responsibility of the Municipal Engineering Management Section of the Bureau, which&#13;
also has responsibility for roads, bridges, streetlights, etc. The latter organization has area-&#13;
based management units, with separate roads and sewers gangs in each. All STWs and&#13;
most sewers are designed by the Taiyuan Municipal Engineering Design Institute (TMEDI).&#13;
However, this institute only takes schemes to the detailed engineering stage: completion of&#13;
tender documents and all subsequent stages of implementation are dealt with by an&#13;
investment institute under the Planning Commission. Public lavatories and the disposal of&#13;
nightsoil are managed by the Sanitation Bureau, and the Environmental Protection Bureau&#13;
is responsible for monitoring discharges to the environment and for collecting volume fees,&#13;
pollution fees and fines. It is apparent that the organizational framework for planning,&#13;
operations, investment, fee collection and financing of sewerage services is fragmented.&#13;
Ideally, the provision of sewerage services should be integrated within a single entity,&#13;
which would have full responsibility for planning, design and financing of systems and for&#13;
the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage and industrial wastes, nightsoil and sewage&#13;
sludge. The formation of such an entity could be considered as a precursor to the formation&#13;
of a Sewerage Company, which would become financially autonomous through the&#13;
collection of user charges for wastewater collection, treatment and disposal. Control of&#13;
discharges to the environment should be effected through a discharge permit system,&#13;
which would set limits for industrial and municipal discharges and ensure these are met&#13;
through enforcement proceedings. The EPB has currently issued permits for 36 major&#13;
factories accounting for 85 percent of wastewater discharged, and has plans to expand the&#13;
system to over 100 factories. At present the permitting system does not encompass&#13;
municipal treatment plants.&#13;
21.   Plans for Expansion. An outline plan for the improvement of existing sewerage&#13;
facilities has been drawn up by TMEDI, taking into account the anticipated increases in&#13;
flows due to the project. The planning horizon assumed is 2010. The planning increases&#13;
the number of drainage areas from 8 to 15, as detailed in Tables 7 and 8, and takes account&#13;
of the new city plan. Investment needs are summarized in Table 9. It is planned to have&#13;
adequate treatment facilities for about 60 percent (700,000 m3/day) of the estimated wastes&#13;
by the year 2002 and for about 75 percent (1,170,000 m3/day) by 2010. Although the&#13;
improvements necessary to overcome existing deficiencies and to accommodate the&#13;
additional loads to be generated by the project have been identified in very broad terms,&#13;
only limited study/design work has been undertaken on these improvements and funding&#13;
has not been secured.&#13;
22.   Outline designs have been prepared for the provision of sludge digestion facilities at&#13;
Yang Jia Bao and for the He Xi Central and North treatment plant (which replace earlier&#13;
proposals for two plants). These are seen to be the priorities. In both cases, the designs&#13;
relate to the preproject capacity scenario, and will need to be revised. The Institute is also&#13;
preparing construction drawings for a proposed plant at Xi Shan on behalf of the Coal&#13;
Mining Bureau for construction later this year&#13;

23.   Financing. The current rate of expenditure on sewerage is Y 30 million per year,&#13;
compared to the need for Y 3.2 billion over the next 20 years, if the plan is to be&#13;
implemented (about Y 150 million per year). The new Provincial Governor has indicated&#13;
that expenditure on sewerage should be stepped up by Y 10 million per year, each year, but&#13;
this will still not be adequate to achieve the program indicated. The Municipality has&#13;
considered foreign finance, and a deputation went abroad to seek an environmental&#13;
protection loan last year, as it was recognized that there would not be an economic rate of&#13;
return on the investment. However, a major share of long-term financing and operational&#13;
costs could be borne by wastewater generators on the "generator pays" principle. The&#13;
proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 10, although it is envisaged that this will be&#13;
reviewed under the Environmental Waste Plan.&#13;

24.   Wastewater Management Master Plan. The Municipal STWs serving Taiyuan&#13;
are well constructed and maintained although the day-to-day management of the plants&#13;
could be improved to optimize their perforrnance. The extent of the sewerage systems is&#13;
such that large volumes of domestic and industrial sewage are discharged directly to&#13;
watercourses resulting in high levels of pollution and risk to public health. The revenue for&#13;
the services supplied is inadequate to cover the costs of the existing service, resulting in&#13;
substandard performance. Outline plans for the improvement of these services have been&#13;
identified and some design work undertaken on specific items. The Urban Master Plan for&#13;
Taiyuan area has been updated to include priority sewerage and industrial wastes collection&#13;
and treatment requirements in the near term. The Taiyuan Municipality and the proposed&#13;
TWMC will also prepare a Wastewater Management Master Plan (WMMP). Terrns of&#13;
Reference for the WMMP have been prepared and will be agreed with the Shanxi&#13;
Government during negotiations.&#13;

ANNEX 5: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Project Concept&#13;
1.    The EIA report for the project was based on the utilization and updating of earlier&#13;
studies of the project, which will meet the requirements of MWR, NEPA, Shanxi&#13;
Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB), and the World Bank.&#13;
2.    The EIA methodology utilized was that described in NEPA's EIA Guidelines&#13;
Modules now routinely used by NEPA and many provincial EPBs. This methodology&#13;
classifies environmental resources into four categories: (a) natural physical resources,&#13;
(b) natural biological resources, (c) human development resources, and (d) quality-of-life&#13;
resources. This identifies and evaluates the significant environmental issues (SEIs), i.e.,&#13;
potentials for adverse effects posed by the project components, and arranges for&#13;
modifications in the project planning so the net overall environmental impact will be&#13;
acceptable. In addition, an overall Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is prepared,&#13;
to be implemented when the project proceeds, and an Environmental Management Office&#13;
(EMO) is established, within the overall Project Management Structure, with&#13;
responsibility for implementing the EMP.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.    Detailed project description is in Chapter 3 and Annex 1 of the SAR. The&#13;
description of the environmental components is summarized below.&#13;
Environmental Protection Components&#13;
4.    Generally, each of the various components of the project has been designed to&#13;
incorporate environmental protection measures as specified in the project EIA.  In&#13;
addition to the project's physical components, the overall present project includes (a) an&#13;
environmental training program, (b) an environmental monitoring program, for both&#13;
construction and operation stages, (c) a public participation program, and (d) an&#13;
Environmental Management Plan with an Environmental Management Office for&#13;
implementing the Environmental Management Plan.&#13;
Project Alternatives&#13;
5.    The decision to import water to Taiyuan from Wanjiazhai reservoir is based on&#13;
extensive studies that show that this is the only feasible solution. No more water, either&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-111-                       ANNEX5&#13;
surface or groundwater, is available locally, hence import of water is essential, and import&#13;
from Wanjiazhai represents by far the lowest cost system.&#13;
6.    With current water shortages in the Project Areas amounting to 40 percent of&#13;
estimated demand, and growing rapidly, and both groundwater and surface water supplies&#13;
declining, failure to complete the project would engender economic, social, and&#13;
envirornmental calamity. Projections using the Provincial Planning Model (PPM) show&#13;
that if the project area urban residents are to be given supplies equaling the norms for&#13;
China, and if farmers water allocations are to be preserved at current levels, industrial and&#13;
mining activities would decline rapidly and virtually cease after the year 2010. It is not&#13;
surprising that Chinese planners have mentioned the possibility that the Taiyuan/Datong&#13;
industries would need to be relocated (at incalculable cost) if project water is not&#13;
forthcoming.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING&#13;
Environmental Study Area (ESA)&#13;
7.    The EIA Main Report (not included here) includes drawings that show the EIAs&#13;
for each of the Phase I EIA component studies, namely Wanjiazhai Reservoir, GMT,&#13;
SMT, Fen- l Reservoir, Connection Works, and the Taiyuan Service Area.&#13;
Land Use&#13;
8.    The overall project ESA is primarily hilly and mountainous and the land use in&#13;
the area can be broadly categorized into farmland, garden plot, forest, grassland, urban&#13;
and industrial area, infrastructure, water area, and wasteland area. Land use in the ESA&#13;
has long been impacted by human activities, primarily agriculture, and the impact has&#13;
been particularly severe on the area's forest and wildlife resources. The land use impact&#13;
of the project per se will be essentially limited to the vicinity of the projects ground-&#13;
surface components.&#13;
Natural Physical Resources&#13;
9.    The project region enjoys temperate/seasonal/continental zone type of climate, is&#13;
drought prone, and the annual precipitation ranges between 430 and 480 mm.&#13;
10.   The project passes through several major tectonic features, including two seismic&#13;
zones. The Pianguan river, a tributary of the Yellow River, constitutes the major surface&#13;
hydrology for the GMT, and the Pianguan, Jian-er, and Fen rivers for the SMT.&#13;
Groundwater along the project is of good quality and suitable for community use&#13;
purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112 -                       ANNEX5&#13;
Natural Biological Resources&#13;
11.   The natural biological resources in Phase I/ESA  may be categorized into&#13;
(a) forests and other vegetation, (b) terrestrial wildlife, and (c) aquatic ecology (see Table&#13;
8).&#13;
12.   With respect to animal wildlife in the ESA, because of low vegetation coverage&#13;
the animal habitats are limited. A total of 133 animal species are found, including 31&#13;
species of resource animals and some 16 species of State-protected animals including 4 in&#13;
the Class I rare category. However, all of the project component facilities (excluding&#13;
tunnels) are located in already humanized developed areas. All of the protected species&#13;
live in areas remote from the project components locations/activities; hence, they should&#13;
not be affected by the project.&#13;
13.   With respect to aquatic species, the ESA waterways contain relatively few aquatic&#13;
plants and aquatic animals. There are some 17 species of fish but these have no&#13;
commercial value and all are hardly of value even for subsistence. There are no known&#13;
rare aquatic species that would be affected. The Fen River is heavily affected by&#13;
Taiyuan, by extractions and pollution discharges, and has no significant remaining&#13;
aquatic species of value.&#13;
Development Resources&#13;
14.   The area along the GMT lines is primarily an agricultural region with limited&#13;
farming and livestock because of limited water and mountainous terrain. Crops like&#13;
millet, beans, corn, oats, potato, sesame, broomcorn millet, and fruits like apple, pears&#13;
and grapes are grown. Livestock development is mainly sheep raising. Agricultural&#13;
production is also low in the SMT area because of poor landform and unfavorable&#13;
climatic conditions, although it still is the main source of income for local people.&#13;
15.   With respect to urbanization/industrialization, most of the project area is hilly and&#13;
mountainous resulting in limited urban industrial development in the region.&#13;
Quality of Life Resources&#13;
16.   Shanxi Province, including the project ESA, represents one of the poorest regions&#13;
in China, despite the presence of considerable mineral resources including the coal&#13;
mining and power industries. The people in the ESA, in their reliance on economic&#13;
income sources, are in roughly two categories: (a) those in urban centers who are&#13;
working mainly in industry, and (b) rural villagers who depend mainly on agriculture.&#13;
The latter are much poorer than the former. By far the most important parameter, which&#13;
is crippling the continuing development of the province, is lack of water supply for all&#13;
sectors of development. This includes both the urban/industrial sector, which represents&#13;
the backbone of the overall economic/socioeconomic resources of the province, and the&#13;
rural farning sector where the people are very poor despite availability of adequate farm&#13;
land areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-113 -                      ANNEX5&#13;
17.   There are no precious archeological relics or monuments of historical or special&#13;
culture located in any of the project component areas.&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND EPMs&#13;
Delineation of Significant Environmental Issues (SEIs)&#13;
18.   The essential findings of the EIA process, namely (a) delineation of the SEIs,&#13;
(b) evaluation of each of these to make a quantified assessment of the potentials for&#13;
adverse environmental effects if no Environmental Protection Measures (EPMs) are&#13;
utilized, and (c) delineation and quantification of the needed EPMs so that the project will&#13;
be economically sound. Needs for environmental monitoring during the construction and&#13;
operation stages are concerned with the water transfer system, which will deliver the&#13;
imported water to Taiyuan City (to the Huyan Water Treatment Plant), and focuses on&#13;
use of the imported water by the City.&#13;
19.   The SEIs identified and evaluated by the project EIA are listed as follows (see&#13;
Table 1):&#13;
(a)   Critical need for additional water for Taiyuan service area;&#13;
(b)   Availability of water for diversion to Taiyuan;&#13;
(c)   Delivery system:&#13;
(i)    Resettlement&#13;
(ii)    Assurance of continuing delivery of imported water&#13;
(iii)    Maintenance of water quality&#13;
(iv)    Construction operations constraints&#13;
(v)    Disposal of tunnel excavation materials&#13;
(vi)    Siltation problems;&#13;
(d)   Use of imported water at Taiyuan:&#13;
(i)    Appropriate use of both imported water and local water resource&#13;
including reuse&#13;
(ii)    Water management and pollution control/water quality in Fen&#13;
River&#13;
(iii)    Coordination of (i) and (ii) for optimal overall water use and&#13;
pollution control system;&#13;
&#13;

(e)   Overall&#13;

stages&#13;
(ii)    Environmental Management Plan and Office&#13;
(iii)    Environmental/Training.&#13;
Evaluation of SEIs&#13;
Land Use&#13;
20.   The significant impacts of the project on land use for Phase I will be in&#13;
(a) acquisition of land for the transmission line facilities that are aboveground, including&#13;
construction camps, and (b) land needed for disposal of tunnel excavation materials. This&#13;
totals some 659 ha, of which 166 ha will be used only temporarily. About 579 ha of the&#13;
required land is farmland. However, the reduction of farmland, both permanent and&#13;
temporary, should not have any significant impacts on farming in the region traversed by&#13;
the Phase I project because this only represents less than 0.1 of 1 percent of the farmland in&#13;
the region.&#13;
Hydrology&#13;
21.   Environmental Concerns. The environmental concerns on project hydrology&#13;
relates to the effects caused by the water transmission system along its route, and on&#13;
beneficial uses of both surface water and groundwater resources, both during the&#13;
construction and operation stages.  The effects due to the construction stage are&#13;
temporary, whereas those during the operation stage are continuing.&#13;
22.   Surface Water. The planned project, when completed, will divert annually from&#13;
Wanjiazhai Reservoir 640 million m3 water to Taiyuan Service Area and 560 million m3&#13;
to the Pingshuo and Datong Service Areas when these are connected. However, for&#13;
Phase 1, limited to SMT, only 640 million m3 will be diverted. No reservoirs are included&#13;
in Phase I, but Phase I will utilize the existing Fen-1 reservoir for regulation purposes.&#13;
The diverted water will have significant positive impacts on the surface water hydrology&#13;
in the three service areas. Assuming the recommended EPMs are properly followed and&#13;
implemented during both construction and operation stages, the project is expected to&#13;
have no significant negative impacts on hydrology in the Project ESA. Use of Fen-I&#13;
reservoir for regulating purposes will not adversely affect the existing function of this&#13;
reservoir.&#13;
23.   Flooding and Siltation Hazards. Flooding hazards are very unlikely to be&#13;
caused by tunnel failures because the tunnels are deeply in the ground. But flood hazards&#13;
may be caused by pipe, aqueduct, or culvert failures due to earthquakes, poor operations,&#13;
and poor construction quality. When such failure occurs, the monitoring and control&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115 -                      ANNEX5&#13;
system to be established along the project will function to stop the diversion immediately,&#13;
so the water released out the pipe or aqueducts is limited to only the water volume in the&#13;
transmission line between two nearest valves (gates), which are designed to be promptly&#13;
closed.&#13;
24.   The only existing stream to which the diverted water will be discharged is the Fen&#13;
River on SMT. While the imported water volume will be about the same as the average&#13;
river flow, the imported volume will represent less than 1 percent of the Fen River flood&#13;
flow peaks. Hence, the effect of the imported water on Fen River hydrology is expected&#13;
to be negligible. With respect to the impact of the silt content of the imported water on&#13;
Fen River siltation, the volume of imported silt is only about 3 percent of that in the river&#13;
from local runoff; hence, the effect of the imported water will be to alleviate existing&#13;
siltation problems.&#13;
25.   Groundwater. All of the tunnels on the GMT and SMT are located above&#13;
groundwater, so no groundwater problems are expected, in either construction or&#13;
operations. Because there are no villages along the tunnel routes, and limited farmland,&#13;
the tunnel operations are not expected to exert any negative impact on groundwater use&#13;
by villagers along these routes.&#13;
26.   Water for construction will be obtained from wells built by the Construction&#13;
Contractors. The wells to be utilized must be stated and identified by each Construction&#13;
Contractors (CC) at the time of his proposal, and the CC must arrange to obtain the water&#13;
he needs without impairment of existing beneficial water users and/or with the&#13;
concurrence of the existing users.&#13;
27.   The construction well will lower the groundwater table to some extent during the&#13;
construction period. However, the impacts should not be significant because the wells&#13;
are located far from existing wells, will extract from areas not conflicting with existing&#13;
wells, and the amounts withdrawn for each well is small (less than 1,000 m3/day).&#13;
28.   Monitoring Program for Hydrology. The Project's EMO will routinely check&#13;
the CC's operations as related to effects on hydrology, so that all potentials for adverse&#13;
effects will be suitably controlled for the purposes of expediting construction and for&#13;
avoiding and/or offsetting any conflicts with existing beneficial water uses. Following&#13;
completion of construction, the EMO will carry out periodic monitoring of effects of&#13;
project operations on hydrology in ESA, including water quality. Details of these&#13;
monitoring programs for hydrology for both construction and operations stages are given&#13;
in the EIA Main Report.&#13;
Special Design Issues&#13;
29.   Tunnel Hazards. The concerns here are that (a) the tunnel design take into&#13;
account the earthquake hazard in the region, (b) provision be made in the tunnel design to&#13;
enable prompt repair of tunnel failures, (c) the overall project plan will include sufficient&#13;
storage in the system's reservoirs to that the system can continue to function in the event&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-116 -                      ANNEX5&#13;
of failure of delivery of water because of tunnel collapse or any other reason, and (d) the&#13;
tunnel construction methods will include adequate attention to worker health and safety.&#13;
In general the overall plan for the project will furnish two months' storage for the target&#13;
service area in order to (i) enable shutdown of delivery from Wanjiazhai for two months,&#13;
and (ii) furnish enough storage to overcome the hazard of tunnel collapse. Use of the&#13;
existing Fen-I reservoir for regulation will furnish the needed two months of storage.&#13;
With respect to Item (d) above, in order to ensure adequate protection for tunnel workers,&#13;
YRDP has changed the method for tunnel construction to use shield-protected core-&#13;
boring machines, which do ensure adequate protection.&#13;
30.   Equipment Erosion Hazards. Because of the high turbidity of the Yellow&#13;
River, the concern here is whether the pumps and other equipment will be eroded by silt&#13;
and thus not be able to function throughout their design life period. Project study reports&#13;
on this subject note that the turbidities will not exceed levels of 3,000 to 4,000 ppm and&#13;
that this does not represent a serious constraint to pump equipment suppliers.&#13;
31.   Reservoir Intake Hazards/Frazile Ice. This hazard is whether there will be&#13;
reservoir intake problems due to entry of ice and/or "frazile" (a kind of ice mush); hence,&#13;
the design will incorporate special precautions to guard against this hazard. In response&#13;
to this problem, YRDP design staff have developed a special type of intake design which&#13;
involves use of a weir with a grill which warms the frazile to turn it into harmless mush&#13;
which is readily managed.&#13;
32.   Disposal of Tunnel Excavation Materials. A special environmental problem for&#13;
project Phase I construction is disposal of tunnel excavation materials so as not to cause&#13;
environmental damage including damage to lands better used for farming, creation of&#13;
flooding hazards, hazards of runoff of these materials to cause pollution/damage, and&#13;
despoiling of environmental scenery. For these reasons, the project Phase I planning&#13;
includes provision of detailed schemes so that disposal will be accomplished in a manner&#13;
which is environmentally sound, as presented in the EIA Main Report Section 4.11.4,&#13;
including Figure 4.11.4-1.&#13;
33.   Silt Deposition Problems. The concern here is whether the silt in the imported&#13;
water might interfere with the project operations. The analysis of this problem shows that&#13;
the silt content of the imported water is only a small fraction, 3 percent, of the silt carried&#13;
by runoff from the Fen River watershed above Fen-1 reservoir; hence the importation&#13;
should actually alleviate existing siltation problems.&#13;
Environmental Review of Resettlement (ERR)&#13;
34.   Purpose and Scope of Task. The EIA Main Report reviews and assess the&#13;
environmental soundness of the resettlement (RS) plan presented in the project RS&#13;
Report, to ensure that the recommended RS plan will include all needed attention to&#13;
applicable environmental parameters, including effects on the RS families, on host&#13;
villages/families, and affected community/regional infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-117 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
35.   The plan also gives due attention to the timeliness of the various RS process&#13;
components, so that preparation of the new situation facilities (houses, land, etc.) will be&#13;
ready for use at the scheduled time for moving residences and/or land uses. Because the&#13;
project does not include any new reservoirs, the RS problem is relatively small for the&#13;
project components included in Phase I. However, for EIA purposes, the overall ERR&#13;
also includes Wanjiazhai reservoir, which has a large RS problem, and the Huyan Water&#13;
Treatment Plant (and related pumping plant), which involves significant urban RS&#13;
problems.&#13;
36.   Approach for Preparing ERR. For ERR purposes, on the basis of the types of&#13;
RS problems involved, the overall ERR study has been divided into four categories as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   GMT: Disturbance in rural areas to both housing and farm production&#13;
lands.&#13;
(b)   SMT and CWs:  Disturbances in rural communities only on farm&#13;
production lands, with no housing losses.&#13;
(c)   Huyan: Only urban land use changes, with no housing losses.&#13;
(d)   Wanjiazhai: Major disturbances in rural communities including both&#13;
housing and farm production lands.&#13;
37.   The project ERR has been patterned after the ERR done a few years ago for the&#13;
Xiaolangdi project. This includes several major categories, with various subcategories,&#13;
for the issues of (a) accommodating RS families, (b) accommodating host communities,&#13;
(c) regional infrastructure needs, (d) public participation, (e) monitoring plan adequacy,&#13;
and (f) overall assessment.&#13;
38.   Summary, Conclusions, and Monitoring. Review of this information indicates&#13;
that the RS Planning programs are reasonable adequate for all four RS sectors. However,&#13;
the YRDP EMO will monitor the RS progress periodically for all Phase I components&#13;
(GMT, SMT, CWs) and also with check progress for Wanjiazhai, working with the&#13;
Wanjiazhai EMO, and for Huyan, working with TEPB. This includes checking on&#13;
progress on the Phase I RS training program. In addition, the Expert Panel for&#13;
Environment and Resettlement to be established by YRDPC is also expected to make&#13;
periodic reviews and recommendations for all RS sector projects.&#13;
Public Health&#13;
39.   The significant hazards for the EIA include both enteric diseases due to&#13;
inadequate sanitation and insect vector diseases, namely encephalitis and hemorrhagic&#13;
fever. Both the construction and operation stages of the project are involved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-118 -                       ANNEX5&#13;
40.   The recommended action program for enteric diseases and insect vector diseases&#13;
control includes the following:&#13;
(a)    Enteric Diseases:  The project's construction program  will include&#13;
provisions for protection against outbreaks of enteric diseases such as&#13;
typhoid and dysentery, by (i) provision of adequate and safe water supply&#13;
and sanitation facilities for construction workers and (ii) medical&#13;
examination (initial and periodic) for construction workers. Also the&#13;
housing buildings for construction workers should be periodically sprayed&#13;
with insecticides for mosquito control.&#13;
(b)   Insect Vector Diseases:  Phase I Project will not finance any dams/&#13;
reservoirs nor any irrigation facilities, hence Phase I will not affect these&#13;
diseases. However, it is recommended that the Phase I Project monitoring&#13;
program will include close check on incidence of these three diseases in&#13;
the overall project region and if any significant increases occur, then&#13;
special control measures should be implemented. During Phase I, it will&#13;
be necessary to monitor rat densities in the construction zones, which may&#13;
tend to increase due to the food available there, and if significant increases&#13;
occur, rat killing measures should be carried out to prevent increases in&#13;
hemorrhagic fever due to the project.&#13;
Ecology&#13;
41.   The project's Phase I will convey water to the Taiyuan Service Area by passing&#13;
through the following areas in sequence, (a) mountainous zone, where the facilities are&#13;
underground, (b) the Fen river, over a reach of some 81.2 km, (c) the Connection Works&#13;
region, for delivery of water from Fen- 1 reservoir to the Taiyuan Service Area.&#13;
42.   Effects on ecology in the mountainous zone will be negligible because the system&#13;
facilities are essentially underground. There are some 22 species of State protected&#13;
species in the mountain areas, but these are remote from urbanizing/industrializing areas&#13;
and should not be affected by the project.&#13;
43.   There will be an impact on the Fen River reach utilized for conveyance, above&#13;
Fen-l reservoir, both for flora and fauna. At present, this river reach includes no valuable&#13;
fishery, not even for subsistence, and no valuable rare species. Because the overall&#13;
project will include rigid control of pollution discharges to the river, including industrial&#13;
discharges, and because the project will add clean fresh water which will increase the&#13;
river flow volume, the river water quality should be significantly improved and this&#13;
should significantly improve habitats for both flora and fauna. The introduction of&#13;
different species from Wanjiazhai reservoir will modify the eco-balance in the river and&#13;
in Fen-1 reservoir but this should hardly affect the overall aquatic ecology in the region.&#13;
44.   The natural ecology in both the Connection Works area and Taiyuan Service Area&#13;
have been essentially displaced by existing development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-119 -                       ANNEX5&#13;
Reservoir EIAs&#13;
45.   Wanjiazhai Reservoir. The Wanjiazhai EIA shows that the project should not&#13;
cause any significant problems of enviromnental degradation, provided it is designed and&#13;
operated as planned, including incorporation of the EPMs specified in the EIA and&#13;
including environmental monitoring in both construction and operation stages, and&#13;
including implementation of provisions for resettlement as specified in the Phase I&#13;
Project RS report (see Table 10). A potential adverse effect on the project is the silt&#13;
content of the diverted water (about I percent) in possibly causing siltation/flooding&#13;
problems in the Fen river system, but the EIA analysis shows that silt content of the&#13;
imported water is much less than in the Fen River (3.3 percent), hence the effects of&#13;
importation will be beneficial. The project will result in large-scale positive benefits&#13;
including flood control and power production and availability of water for export to the&#13;
project target areas. Export of Wanjiazhai water for the project will decrease the total&#13;
water availability in the Lower Yellow River Basin, but the approved overall&#13;
governmental plan for allocation of the Yellow River water resource includes provisions&#13;
for project diversion needs.&#13;
46.   Fen-1 Reservoir.  Use of Fen-1 reservoir for project regulation, following&#13;
construction, will bring about minor changes in reservoir hydrology, but without adverse&#13;
effects, and the impact on the existing flood protection function of the reservoir will be&#13;
small compared to that from local runoff, hence no adverse effects are expected. The&#13;
imported water inflow will result in some shift in the reservoir aquatic ecology balance,&#13;
but this should not result in any adverse effects on the reservoir fishery nor on the&#13;
regional aquatic ecology.&#13;
47.   Erosion and Sedimentation. Assuming that the contracts for the CCs include&#13;
provisions as noted in the section on "Construction Constraints" and assuming proper use&#13;
of environmental construction inspectors, construction of the project will not cause any&#13;
significant erosion problems. Also, because the diverted silt represents only a small&#13;
amount of the total silt reaching the Fen River course and Fen-l Reservoir, around 3&#13;
percent, no significant impacts are expected on sedimentation in the areas along SMT.&#13;
Quality of Life&#13;
48.   People Living along Water Transmission System. The only significant effect&#13;
of the project's transmission system will be impacts on people whose houses or lands will&#13;
be taken over and utilized for these facilities. There are only a small number of such&#13;
families, and all of their losses will be compensated for, at rates such that the net effect is&#13;
expected to be beneficial for all affected families.&#13;
49.   Taiyuan Service Area (TSA).  The project will certainly result in great&#13;
improvements in quality of life in TSA, all made possible by the availability of the&#13;
imported water to alleviate the existing severe water shortage. These benefits include&#13;
(a) considerably increased family income resulting from improved industrial productivity,&#13;
(b) marked increase in per capita water use, so that residents will have decent amounts of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-120 -                      ANNEX5&#13;
water for washing and bathing and for toilets, (c) significant decrease in disease rates for&#13;
enteric diseases, stemming from steady availability of pipe water to homes/buildings, and&#13;
(d) great improvements in urban greening areas and in urban recreational areas.&#13;
Construction Constraints&#13;
50.   Historically  CCs have often caused unnecessary  environmental damage,&#13;
sometimes serious, simply because it is the nature of the CC, and of the Engineering&#13;
Supervision of Construction, to focus on expediting building of the project physical&#13;
components, with relatively low-priority attention to EPMs. However, experience has&#13;
shown that it is quite feasible/affordable for the CC to observe and comply with the&#13;
EPMs specified in EIA. These will be included in the terms of reference (TOR) for the&#13;
CC's construction contract and ECIs will be made available by EMO to observe the CC's&#13;
operations and to require compliance. Main Report Figures 4.11.2-1 and 4.11.4-1&#13;
summarize the details.&#13;
Interbasin Water Transfer Feasibility&#13;
51.   The project has been an approved component of the Government's overall Yellow&#13;
River Basin Plan for the past two decades. This will divert about 2 percent of the mean&#13;
annual river flow and about 5 percent of dry-year flows, but the Wanjiazhai storage is&#13;
from periods of higher river flow, and this should not pose hardships on downstream&#13;
water users. This issue was further investigated using the Bank's Basin Level Planning&#13;
Model. These studies confirmed that the project will not create problems for the&#13;
downstream users assuming that all "Shareholders" of the river do not extract more than&#13;
their allocated share.&#13;
Connection Works&#13;
52.   The EIA for the CWs (Connection Works), described in EIA Main Report Section&#13;
4.13, notes that (a) because the CWs are located in already developed areas, there will be&#13;
no adverse effects on forests/wildlife, (b) no adverse effects on aquatic ecology (in Fen&#13;
River and Fen-1 Reservoir) are expected, (c) no adverse effects on Fen-1 Reservoir&#13;
existing operating functions are expected, (d) no effect on archeological/historic or&#13;
cultural values are expected, (e) there will be some use of land now used for other&#13;
purposes, but only some 16 ha permanently and 235 ha on a temporary basis, (f) there&#13;
will be no significant changes in the quality of the imported water due to river passage&#13;
and reservoir storage, and (g) the only significant hazard for environment will be that for&#13;
the construction stage.&#13;
Global Environmental Issues&#13;
53.   The primary environmental concerns, from  the global point of view, are:&#13;
(a) earth-warming, (b) ozone layer increase, and (c) biological diversity degradation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-121-                      ANNEX5&#13;
54.   Because the project components that are aboveground are in areas that are already&#13;
"humanized," with little significant remaining natural ecological resources, the project is&#13;
not expected to have any significant effects on the biodiversity situation in the ESA&#13;
region. However, the monitoring program to be managed by EMO will include an annual&#13;
survey of the status of ecology in ESA including forests, swamps, and wildlife.&#13;
55.   The project does not involve use or production of substances to be discharged to&#13;
atmosphere which will contribute to ozone layer depletion.&#13;
56.   The project will require expenditure of a considerable amount of electrical energy&#13;
for enabling pumping of the imported water into the service areas, but this total amount is&#13;
insignificant in terms of China's production of earth warming gases from burning of coal.&#13;
Hence, the project should have no significant impact on China's total contribution to&#13;
earth warming.&#13;
Water Supply, Uses and Pollution Control&#13;
57.   Water Supply and Use. Annex 7 of the SAR shows the new water supply, water&#13;
demand and balance for the Taiyuan Service Area, which will result from water imported&#13;
by the project.&#13;
58.   Water Pollution Control. The project will generate wastewater that will have to&#13;
be managed, along with existing wastewaters, so that significant environmental pollution&#13;
impacts are properly controlled and managed. The increased wastewater volumes that&#13;
will result in Taiyuan from new water have been forecasted for the years 2002, 2010, and&#13;
2020. Assuming that primary treatment is required for agricultural reuse, and that&#13;
secondary treatment is required for discharge and for agricultural and industrial reuse,&#13;
Taiyuan City has developed a plan to increase wastewater treatment capabilities to almost&#13;
100 percent for the target years. The plan is summarized in the following:&#13;
Year                             1995       2002       2010        2020&#13;
Wastewater Flow, 104 m3/day        65         114        156        207&#13;
Treatment, % of Total&#13;
Primary                            0          7         32         51&#13;
Secondary                         19         51         42         42&#13;
Tertiary                           0          0          0          7&#13;
Stabilization Pond                 0         38         26          0&#13;
Treated Wastewater %                19        96         100        100&#13;
59.   The plan calls for use of stabilization ponds in the tributaries of Fen River and&#13;
along the banks of Fen River to provide additional treatment when wastewater collection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-122 -                      ANNEX5&#13;
and treatment plants are being built. The target is to phase out stabilization ponds and&#13;
have sufficient collection systems and treatment plants in use by 2020.&#13;
60.   Cost estimates for treating wastewater generated until the year 2020 have been&#13;
developed. The estimated treatment costs for the period until 2020 are about Y 2.8&#13;
billion.&#13;
Water Quality&#13;
61.   The impact of the planned project water conveyance system on the quality of the&#13;
imported water should not be significant for all salient water quality parameters because&#13;
the system will comprise mostly tunnels and culverts that will be enclosed. However, the&#13;
receiving Fen River is an open stream and will be vulnerable to contamination. This will&#13;
require the waste management program mentioned in the section on "Water Pollution&#13;
Control."&#13;
62.   The quality of the raw water delivered to Taiyuan and other service areas will&#13;
correspond to Class III in the National Government's classification system. Based on the&#13;
available date on Yellow River water quality at Wanjiazhai and elsewhere in the Yellow&#13;
River system, it appears that the imported water delivered to the service areas will be&#13;
suitable for a raw water supply for all intended uses, with treatment needed to meet&#13;
drinking water standards. Conventional rapid sand filtration with effluent chlorination&#13;
should meet this need.&#13;
63.   The project is not expected to adversely affect groundwater quality in the ESA&#13;
except during the construction stages when use of groundwater by the CC must be strictly&#13;
controlled.&#13;
64.   Assuming implementation of the treatment program described in the section on&#13;
"Water Pollution Control," it is expected that the water quality in Fen River will not be&#13;
adversely impacted by wastewater discharges. The predicted pollution concentration in&#13;
the Fen River would be much lower than the current condition (see Table 11).&#13;
Integrated Management of Water Supply/Use/Pollution Control&#13;
65.   To ensure that industries and municipalities will treat their wastewater prior to&#13;
discharge, an area-wide regulatory/implementation agency will be established as shown&#13;
in Figure 3. This is to perform the functions currently being accomplished by several&#13;
governmental agencies with the following responsibilities:&#13;
(a)   Regulating water use to ensure optimal overall use of the limited water&#13;
supply, with priority to substitute use of treated effluent by industries in&#13;
place of using freshwater, and use of treated effluents for other reuse&#13;
purposes including agricultural irrigation and groundwater recharging, so&#13;
that freshwater use is limited to priority purposes. This will be achieved&#13;
by use of an appropriate pricing structure and by monitoring/enforcement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-123 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
(b)   Establishing appropriate standards for wastewater treatment and for reuse&#13;
of treated wastewater as water supply.&#13;
(c)   Strengthening the existing permit system to be similar to that used in the&#13;
United States, so all industries which produce significant wastes (liquid&#13;
and solid) will build/operate their own treatment systems as needed to&#13;
protect environment. The permit system involves establishing appropriate&#13;
discharge standards, monitoring the quality of discharge effluents, and&#13;
enforcing the regulations through a penalty system for violators. River&#13;
water toxicity will be controlled, primarily by the use of the permit&#13;
system, so that existing discharges from industries will cease.&#13;
(d)   Establishing/maintaining  an environmental monitoring program  for&#13;
exercising surveillance on all waste treatment facilities, including sewage&#13;
treatment plants and solid waste disposal sites, and for ambient water&#13;
quality monitoring, as needed for achieving a comprehensive area-wide&#13;
monitoring program.&#13;
(e)   Establishing a water pricing mechanism to promote optimal water reuse.&#13;
(f)   Provision of an education and training of industrial and municipal staff&#13;
and the public about the significance of uncontrolled discharges and the&#13;
importance of waste management, to promote awareness and acceptance&#13;
of the program.&#13;
66.   The ultimate goal of the integrated management mechanics is to achieve the&#13;
optimal water use, reuse, and pollution control system shown in Figure 2. This would be&#13;
similar to the program of this type now in action in Southern California.&#13;
67.   The overall project loan includes an allocation of $8.0 million for establishing a&#13;
Clean Technologies Fund for industries.  This program  is consistent with and&#13;
supplementary and complementary to the recommendations made in the presents EIA.&#13;
Pollution Control Achievement at Taiyuan City&#13;
68.   Despite the many difficulties involved, the Taiyuan city agencies, working in&#13;
close cooperation with the Provincial agencies, have over the past decade made&#13;
impressive progress in planning and implementing a comprehensive water pollution&#13;
program in the Taiyuan service area. This includes:&#13;
(a)   Preparation of a comprehensive municipal sewerage management plan,&#13;
and implementation of the plan including treatment of some 19 percent of&#13;
the total city sewage, with planning to achieve comprehensive control by&#13;
year 2020.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-124 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
(b)   Establish of an initial permit system for control of industrial waste&#13;
discharg_s, resulting in much more plant recycling and use of in-plant&#13;
treatment to meet discharge requirements including reduction in discharge&#13;
of heavy metals.&#13;
(c)   Establishment of the initial comprehensive water quality monitoring&#13;
program, covering both pollution sources and ambient water quality of&#13;
receiving waters, to gain factual data on the extent and nature of waste&#13;
management problems.&#13;
(d)   Initiation of other measures including public education on water&#13;
conservation, reducing leakage in water supply distribution, and&#13;
promoting industrial water reuses and other reuse of treated effluents.&#13;
69.   These activities represent a good beginning step towards achieving optimal water&#13;
use/reuse/pollution control, and are firm evidence of the keen interest of the local officials&#13;
in striving to solve their water use/pollution problems and of their willingness to give real&#13;
support to achieving the goals of the proposed project.&#13;
E. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION&#13;
Public Participation (PP)&#13;
70.   YRDP has been active in PP work on the project even since initial establishment&#13;
of YRDP in the 1950s. These activities have increased over the years, as YRDP's role&#13;
has expanded, with detailed attention beginning in 1992.  Considerable public&#13;
participation has been taking place during 1993-97, through involvement of counties in&#13;
the project preparation activities.&#13;
Compliance with Environmental Laws&#13;
71.   Both NEPA and the World Bank require that the EIA include information&#13;
showing how the project complies with China's environmental laws and regulations. The&#13;
full-scale EIA study has included such attention to all known environmental laws and&#13;
regulations applicable to the project.&#13;
Environmental Economics&#13;
72.   The project may truly be said to be a project planned with the primary objectives&#13;
of improving the socioeconomics of the primary economic-earning areas of Shanxi&#13;
province. These are already critically short of water for virtually all human development&#13;
needs including (a) domestic and commercial, (b) industrial, and (c) agricultural needs.&#13;
The imported water will be used first for municipal purposes, with second priority to&#13;
industry to maintain employment stability, and then to agriculture. It is also planned to&#13;
reduce existing use of freshwater resources for agriculture by substituting use of treated&#13;
sewage effluents. In addition, the imported water will reduce pressures for more and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-125 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
more ground-level subsidence, already very serious and causing serious economic/&#13;
socioeconomic losses to all affected community sectors. Thus, the project may be said to&#13;
be a truly economic-cum-environmental-cum social development project.&#13;
73.   The argument may be made that the project favors the socioeconomics of the&#13;
urbanized target areas, which are less poor than the rural areas. This is true, but it is these&#13;
target areas that are of prime importance to the overall economy and socioeconomics of&#13;
the entire province. Also, where reservoirs are to be built as part of the project, it is&#13;
planned that the resettled rural farmers will be benefited, that is, their housing and income&#13;
levels will be improved as a result of the resettlement.&#13;
Risk Assessment&#13;
74.   Table 12 summarizes the Risk Assessment evaluation. The project is expected to&#13;
be a well engineered project and moreover should be financially sound because of the&#13;
precious value of the imported water for sustaining the economy of Shanxi Province. The&#13;
real risk, actually, is the risk that the project might not get built.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING&#13;
Description of Monitoring Program&#13;
75.   An essential component of the overall project is its Environmental Monitoring&#13;
program, which is to cover both the construction and operations stages of the project, thus&#13;
covering a period of some 25 years. The monitoring work should begin as soon as the&#13;
Environmental Management Office becomes operative in June 1997. The summarized&#13;
monitoring program to be administered by EMO is shown in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5,&#13;
including delineation of tasks and costs.&#13;
76.   The costs for professional EMO staffing are estimated at Y 13.04 million or&#13;
$1.5875 million for the total of 25.5 years (preconstruction 0.5 years, construction 5&#13;
years, operations 20 years), average $62,000 per year (see Table 6).&#13;
Management of Monitoring Program&#13;
77.   The monitoring program is to be managed and supervised by the EMO, with&#13;
much of the detailed field work done by the ECIs and some by the EMO office staff.&#13;
However, other agencies, including the provincial EPP. Hydrographic Station, AES, and&#13;
Shanxi University are to participate in the field work in accordance with agreements with&#13;
YRDPC. Costs for monitoring work by these other agencies, which is outside their&#13;
normal scope of monitoring, are to be reimbursed by YRDPC.&#13;
Importance of Monitoring Program&#13;
78.   Note that the overall monitoring program includes essentially two components:&#13;
(a) monitoring to ensure continuing delivery of water to the service area, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-126 -                       ANNEX5&#13;
(b) monitoring to ensure optimal use of the imported (and expensive) water in the service&#13;
area, including monitoring of water use and reuse, waste management/water pollution&#13;
control, and Fen River water quality.&#13;
79.   The monitoring costs are significant but actually very small as related to total&#13;
project costs, and the benefit/cost ratio will be large. The monitoring data will be&#13;
essential for purposes of optimal water use planning and for this reason will result in&#13;
large savings through minimization of water wastage. The monitoring is absolutely&#13;
essential to the success of the project.&#13;
G. ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING&#13;
Need for Training&#13;
80.   Implementation of the project will be a pioneering project for Shanxi Province in&#13;
transbasin diversion of water on a massive scale, for meeting the critical needs for more&#13;
water to support continuing growth and development of parched areas of northern China.&#13;
Because of the excessively high cost of such imported water, it is essential that&#13;
conventional practices on water use, waste treatment, water pollution control, and water&#13;
reuse be reoriented to achieve an integrated comprehensive program that makes&#13;
maximum/optimal use of the precious water for all essential water uses in the service&#13;
areas (Taiyuan Service Area for Phase I) including domestic, commercial, industrial, and&#13;
agricultural needs, including balanced use of all freshwater resources (local surface water,&#13;
local groundwater, and imported water), and including institutional, legal, economic, and&#13;
financing as well as engineering aspects.&#13;
Recommended Training&#13;
81.   In order to achieve this goal, a training program is needed to strengthen the&#13;
capabilities of the officials involved in the project including YRDPC, Shanxi Province,&#13;
and local agencies, in the various new approaches and methodologies which will be&#13;
utilized. The recommended training program, shown in Table 7, is a specialized training&#13;
program to be an integral part of the Phase I project. This program, to cost an estimated&#13;
$368,500, will include training by foreign experts of selected Chinese personnel who will&#13;
then conduct training courses at Taiyuan for stuff of participating agencies, plus a visit by&#13;
a selected team to foreign countries to study integrated water r ,e technologies developed&#13;
there over the past four decades.&#13;
Value of Training Program&#13;
82.   The proposed training program should prove to be one of the most cost-effective&#13;
components of the entire project. Its total cost is small, only a very small percentage of&#13;
total first-phase investment cost, but this small investment is essential if the precious&#13;
imported water is to be wisely used. It is expected that the training program will result in&#13;
more appropriate planning decisions on investments in facilities and thus result in savings&#13;
of tens of millions of dollars over the Phase I project design life period.&#13;

H. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
83.   The  Environmental Management Plan  (EMP) comprises  environmental&#13;
management activities and institutional arrangements, particularly the Environmental&#13;
Management Office (EMO), which is designed to ensure that all of the EPMs specified in&#13;
the EIA, including environmental monitoring, will be actually carried out.&#13;
Environmental Management System&#13;
84.   To ensure effective administration of environmental management, YRDP will&#13;
create the Environmental Management Lead Group and Environmental Management&#13;
Office (EMO), whose combined responsibility is the administration and implementation&#13;
of the EMP. The Lead Group will be comprised of senior officials of YRDP, the&#13;
provincial environmental agencies, and local agencies that will have responsibilities for&#13;
undertaking specific environmental management tasks. Figure 1 shows the institutional&#13;
roles of the EMO.&#13;
85.  In addition, YRDPC will establish an Expert Panel on Environment, comprising&#13;
distinguished foreign and Chinese experts, which will meet every six months to review&#13;
YRDP progress in implementing the Phase I's environmental (and resettlement) action&#13;
programs. The scope of work by EMO and Expert Panel is to include periodic review of&#13;
the progress of MWR Wanjiazhai Reservoir Management EMO in implementing the&#13;
EPMs specified in the EIA for Wanjiazhai.&#13;
Environmental Management Activities&#13;
86.   The overall environmental management activities are illustrated in Table 3.&#13;
EMO Costs and Justification&#13;
87.   The total costs as shown in Table 6 for the EMO EMP program are estimated to&#13;
be approximately $4.194 million, for a total period of 25.5 years including 0.5 years for&#13;
preconstruction activities, 5 years for construction, plus 20 years of operation. This&#13;
averages about $164,500 per year. This cost represents a very small percentage of the&#13;
total Phase I project cost, and is very much less than what is practiced in Western&#13;
countries for similar projects. Experience has shown that the benefit/cost ratio for this&#13;
investment is very high because it is essential to ensure that the project will be&#13;
economically-cum-environmentally sound, therefore sustainable.&#13;
I. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
EIA Team and Report&#13;
88.   The EIA has been carried out for YRDPC by CIRP/Shanxi University with the&#13;
assistance of WB/EIA team members, over the period July 1995 to July 1996. The EIA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-128-                      ANNEX5&#13;
Main Report and the Executive Summary Report have been prepared in both the Chinese&#13;
version (to meet NEPA requirements) and the English version (to meet World Bank&#13;
requirements). Both versions use the same Table of Contents and are essentially the same&#13;
in substance.&#13;
Management of Significant Environmental Issues&#13;
89.   Tables 8, 9 and 10 summarize the environmental impacts of the project. It (a) lists&#13;
all of the SEIs, (b) quantifies each in terms of potentials for adverse effects if not&#13;
controlled, of potentials for benefits with feasible controls, and of net effects with these&#13;
controls, (c) shows the EPMs measures which must be taken as part of the feasible&#13;
control system, and (d) shows the net environmental effects. Table 1 shows the control&#13;
measures and, assuming proper implementation of EPMs by the EMO, the project will&#13;
achieve great environmental benefits with virtually no significant environmental losses.&#13;
Xiaolangdi Experience&#13;
90.   Because conditions for the SEIs for the project are similar in many respects to the&#13;
SEIs for Xiaolangdi, the pioneering experience of the Xiaolangdi project in managing&#13;
these issues (including construction stage problems) furnishes very valuable guidelines&#13;
for project EIA purposes.&#13;

ANNEX 6: RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION (R&amp;R)&#13;
ACTION PLAN&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    This annex describes the land acquisition and resettlement impacts under the&#13;
project, the framework developed by Shanxi Provincial Government for implementation&#13;
of R&amp;R activities and an evaluation of R&amp;R programs completed. Resettlement planning&#13;
of Wanjiazhai Dam and Reservoir Project, financed by the Chinese Government alone&#13;
and indirectly linked with the project, is also described.&#13;
B. LAND ACQUISITION AND ADVERSE IMPACTS&#13;
2.    The following components of the project requires land acquisition:&#13;
(a)   General Main Tunnel (GMT). GMT component includes 11 tunnels, 3&#13;
pumping stations and 4 aqueducts. The total length is 44.35 km.&#13;
(b)   South Main Tunnel (SMT).  SMT consists of 103 km waterways&#13;
including 7 tunnels with a length of 98 km, 3 aqueducts and 2&#13;
aboveground pumping stations.&#13;
(c)   Connection Works. This component consists of 40.2 km of transmission&#13;
pipelines and 6 tunnels of 16.75 km.&#13;
(d)   Taiyuan Water Supply. This component includes a new water treatment&#13;
plant and two booster stations.&#13;
Census Survey&#13;
3.    Census surveys were undertaken on the physical losses for different components&#13;
of the project. The census surveys were conducted according to the "Detailed Rule And&#13;
Regulations on Physical Loss Survey of Reservoir Inundation for Water Conservancy&#13;
And Hydropower Projects" by the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR). The surveys&#13;
were conducted by the design institutes under the guidance of the Resettlement Office of&#13;
the project in collaboration with the relevant County Resettlement Offices (CROs) and&#13;
township governments and village leaders. The census survey of GMT and SMT was&#13;
conducted in February/March 1993 and updated in December 1995. The census survey&#13;
was carried out in April 1996 for the Connection Works while the survey for the Water&#13;
Treatment Plant and Booster Stations was conducted in June 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-143 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
4.    All physical losses and the number of affected persons were inventoried on&#13;
household basis and signed by the family head and the village leaders. Relevant&#13;
information is recorded on the Household Registration Information Booklet, which will&#13;
be issued to all affected households.&#13;
Adverse Impacts&#13;
5.    Adverse impacts have been identified in the following categories: (a) acquisition&#13;
of 7,393 mu of agricultural land, (b) temporary leasing of 2,495 mu of agricultural land,&#13;
(c) relocation of 23 small enterprises, (d) resettlement of 54 persons in 16 households.&#13;
The impacts are detailed in Table 1.&#13;
6.    About 1,204 persons will lose land, including 54 persons in 16 households who&#13;
have lost both land and houses and have resettled in their new houses. 273 enterprise&#13;
employees will be affected due to the relocation of their enterprises. See Table 2.&#13;
Socioeconomic Surveys&#13;
7.    Socioeconomic surveys were conducted separately for GMT, SMT and the&#13;
Connection Works.  The surveys were undertaken by the Design Institutes in&#13;
collaboration with the local resettlement offices and governments in May 1996. The&#13;
surveys established the baseline living standards of the affected persons and provide the&#13;
basis for future comparisons.&#13;
C. LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
8.    The Chinese government has issued a number of laws, regulations and guidelines&#13;
related to resettlement planning and implementation. Resettlement under the project is&#13;
prepared in accordance with these laws, regulations and guidelines. The main laws and&#13;
regulations concerning resettlement are listed in Table 3.&#13;
D. FRAMEWORK FOR PROJECT R&amp;R IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
9.    The Project Resettlement Office has prepared separate land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement action plans (RAP) for the GMT, SMT, Connection Works and Huyan Water&#13;
Treatment Plant in accordance with the legal framework and the Bank OD 4.30. A&#13;
framework for R&amp;R implementation has been laid out in the various RAPs.&#13;

Objectives and Principles of Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
10.    The objective of the R&amp;R is to ensure that the standards of living of all project-&#13;
affected persons are improved, or at least restored. To achieve the objective, the&#13;
following principles have been adhered to in the preparation of the RAPs:&#13;
(a)    Land acquisition and resettlement should be minimized as much as&#13;
possible&#13;
(b)    All structures should be paid at replacement cost without depreciation&#13;
(c)    Compensation should be paid to the owner collectives before  land&#13;
acquisition and used for productive purpose&#13;
(d)    All affected infrastructure would be replaced&#13;
(e)    Priority in job opportunities with the project should be given to project-&#13;
affected people&#13;
(f)    Land should be redistributed to farmers in all villages losing land to the&#13;
project&#13;
(g)    All affected enterprises would be assisted in relocation and workers would&#13;
be provided allowance during relocation&#13;
(h)    Full participation of the affected persons would be guaranteed during RAP&#13;
preparation and implementation&#13;
(i)    The affected persons should be able to redress their grievances&#13;

Compensation Policies For Different Categories of Project Adverse Impacts&#13;
11.    Land Acquisition.  Compensation for agricultural land permanently acquired is&#13;
estimated by applying specified multiplier to the average per mu annual output during the&#13;
past three years. Different compensation rates have been calculated for different types of&#13;
land in different areas, varying from Y 945 to Y 28,000 per mu. Details of compensation&#13;
calculation are provided in Table 4.&#13;
12.    Land Leasing. Compensation for land to be leased would be paid at three times&#13;
of their average per mu annual output, varying from Y 405 to Y 12,000 per mu. The&#13;
leasing period is normally two to three years, after which the project would return the&#13;
leased land fully restored in its previous productive condition. Any cost in restoring the&#13;
land productivity would be borne by the project.&#13;
13.    Structures.  Affected  structures would be compensated  at replacement cost,&#13;
which were estimated with market information in different areas and updated in early&#13;
1996. Details of the cost are provided in the RAPs.&#13;
14.    Impact on Enterprises. Affected enterprises would be provided alternative sites&#13;
free of cost. Affected buildings, structures, etc., would be paid at replacement costs&#13;
including relocation cost. Enterprise employees would be paid allowance equivalent to&#13;
monthly salaries during the period when production is stopped.&#13;

R&amp;R Strategy of Rehabilitation&#13;
19.    The project will acquire a total of 7,393 mu of agricultural land, affecting 1,204&#13;
persons. The project, based on the findings of the field investigations and analysis of&#13;
local resources, has formulated the rehabilitation strategy through land development, off-&#13;
farm employment and pension arrangement.&#13;
20.    On-farm  Development. Given the rich land resources and poor cultivation in the&#13;
affected villages, land development is planned as the major rehabilitation measure.&#13;
YRDPC RO and design institutes, working closely with township and village&#13;
representatives, conducted field investigations to analyze land resources, the current&#13;
production levels and potentials of agriculture development in each village. Village-wise,&#13;
plans have been formulated for land development through slopeland and rotation land&#13;
terracing, wasteland reclamation and on-farm irrigation works. In villages where average&#13;
per capita land holding is above 5 mu, it is planned that 854 mu of dry flat land and&#13;
1,892 mu of dry slopeland will be distributed to the PAPs out of the remaining land. On-&#13;
farm works will be conducted to increase agricultural yield. In villages where per capita&#13;
landholding falls below 5 mu, it is planned to terrace 3,713 mu of slopeland and reclaim&#13;
148 mu of wasteland, which will be distributed to the affected persons to maintain per&#13;
capita landholding. A total of 983 PAPs will be provided agricultural land.&#13;
21.    Off-employment.  Some villages in the Connection Works Component have&#13;
planned to invest land compensation in off-farm developments and provide jobs to the&#13;
affected farmers in these enterprises. Some affected farmers have seen the opportunity in&#13;
transport business and have opted for self-employment with the compensation. 76 PAPs&#13;
will be engaged in either private or collective transport business. See details in Table 6.&#13;

22.   Rehabilitation of Leased Land. The project will lease temporarily 2,495 mu of&#13;
agriculture land during construction, 1,489 mu of which is along the Connection Works.&#13;
The project will pay compensation for the leased land and return the land to the farmers&#13;
in its restored productive condition when leasing is over. The RAPs have included clear&#13;
rehabilitation standard of the leased land, the inspection and acceptance procedure and&#13;
rehabilitation schedule.&#13;
23.   Pension Arrangement. 126 elderly PAPs and children are eligible for pension in&#13;
Luyukou Village in the Connection Works Component. They will be provided Y 900 per&#13;
year per person for their pension. This pension will be provided to the old all their life&#13;
and to the children until they reach the age of 18.&#13;
24.   Support Services. YRDPC RO has drawn up detailed training program for the&#13;
affected farmers to equip them with new skills required for livelihood development&#13;
activities. PAP training will cover irrigated farming, vegetable growing, animal-rearing&#13;
and vehicle driving. The existing agricultural extension system will provide special&#13;
support to the affected villages in their livelihood development activities. They will&#13;
provide extension services to the PAPs, deliver timely agricultural input including seeds,&#13;
fertilizer, pesticide and agricultural machinery services. County governments will be&#13;
responsible for the construction of all necessary irrigation facilities.&#13;
Preferential Policy&#13;
25.   Shanxi Provincial Government has issued "Preferential Policy for Resettlement&#13;
And Rehabilitation of the Affected Persons in Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project."&#13;
Major provisions are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Any houses, public buildings, enterprise and public facilities to be&#13;
constructed under the R&amp;R program will be exempted from charges for&#13;
urban infrastructure construction, tax for farmland occupation.&#13;
(b)   Enterprises for resettlement, collective or private, would be exempted&#13;
from income tax for three years from the time of yielding profit.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-151-                      ANNEX6&#13;
(g)   Priority should be given to PAPs in providing agriculture credit and low-&#13;
interest loans.&#13;
(h)   An reservoir construction fund is planned to be created with project profits&#13;
to help livelihood development of the PAPs.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
26.   RAP implementation schedule is dovetailed with the construction plan of the civil&#13;
works. Land acquisition and resettlement for the GMT had been completed by April&#13;
1996 while livelihood development activities are still underway and will be completed in&#13;
1997. Land acquisition on SMT, started already, will continue till the end of 1998 and&#13;
livelihood development activities will continue till 2001. RAP implementation will start&#13;
in 1997 for the Connection Works and will be completed in 2001. RAP implementation&#13;
for the Water Treatment Plant started in 1996 and will be completed in 1997. YRDPC&#13;
RO has prepared a detailed CPM schedule of all land acquisition and livelihood&#13;
development activities for all components of the project. This CPM schedule will be&#13;
used to monitor the progress of R&amp;R activities and will be updated semiannually.&#13;
Institutional Framework&#13;
27.   A complete R&amp;R institutional framework has been set up for the implementation&#13;
of land acquisition and resettlement under the project.&#13;
28.   Project Bureau (YRDPC). It is responsible for overall R&amp;R implementation on&#13;
behalf of Shanxi Provincial Government.&#13;
29.   Project Resettlement Office (YRDPCRO). YRDPC RO has been established&#13;
within YRDPC with four full-time staff, experienced in resettlement. It has the overall&#13;
responsibility for the planning, coordination, supervising of land acquisition and R&amp;R&#13;
activities and R&amp;R staff training under the project.&#13;
30.   Field Resettlement Offices. Resettlement offices have been established in the&#13;
three field construction offices, each with three to five staff. They are responsible for&#13;
land acquisition, contracting with local governments, supervising R&amp;R progress. They&#13;
will provide necessary support to CROs and TROs in RAP implementation. They will&#13;
report to YRDPC RO.&#13;
31.   County Resettlement Office (CRO). CROs have been set up in each of the&#13;
affected counties, each staffed with 5 to 10 persons. They are responsible for the&#13;
planning and implementation of livelihood developments, payment of compensation to&#13;
affected villages and coordination of land acquisition, resettlement and civil works. They&#13;
will submit quarterly R&amp;R progress reports to the field offices.&#13;
32.   Township Resettlement Office (TRO). TROs have been set up in the township&#13;
governments. They are mainly responsible for disseminating resettlement policies to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-152 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
affected villages, supervising and assisting villages in land development and land&#13;
redistribution.&#13;
Participation And Consultation&#13;
33.   Project R&amp;R planning has been undertaken in a participatory manner.  All&#13;
relevant line agencies, administrations, entities and communities were consulted&#13;
systematically in R&amp;R planning. Particular attention was devoted to the participation of&#13;
and consultation with the affected communities.&#13;
34.   Project information was disseminated to the PAPs at an early stage. Information&#13;
dissemination meetings were held at the village level, where project information, possible&#13;
adverse impacts, suggested compensation rates, resettlement arrangements, proposals for&#13;
rehabilitation were presented and discussed with the PAPs. The RAPs were revised with&#13;
suggestions from the PAPs. A resettlement information booklet was prepared. After the&#13;
review of the RAP by the Bank, the RIB will be reproduced and distributed to all the&#13;
PAPs' households.&#13;
35.   Village leaders and representatives of the villagers participated actively in the&#13;
census and socioeconomic survey carried out by YRDPC RO, CROs and design&#13;
institutes. The results of the census were recorded and signed by village leaders. The&#13;
villagers have also contributed to RAP preparation, particularly in the formulation of&#13;
livelihood development programs.&#13;
36.   Consultation with the affected communities is planned to continue until the&#13;
project is completed. Field surveys and meetings have been held with affected villagers&#13;
to evaluate the completed R&amp;R programs along the GMT, SMT and propose additional&#13;
measures. YRDPC RO plans (a) to undertake bimonthly regular surveys of the affected&#13;
persons over R&amp;R implementation, covering, at least, 40 percent of total affected persons&#13;
and (b) to hold public meetings with affected persons once a month to improve R&amp;R&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Grievance Mechanism&#13;
37.   Shanxi Government has grievance redress offices at various levels. They have&#13;
been notified to give special attention to redress of grievances from PAPs regarding any&#13;
aspects of land acquisition and resettlement under the project. PAPs can approach these&#13;
offices to seek redress of their grievances. PAPs also have the right to appeal to the court&#13;
to seek resolution of their grievances.&#13;
38.   Apart from the existing grievance redress mechanisms, Shanxi Government has&#13;
established a three-stage grievance channel for project PAPs:&#13;
(a)   If any affected person is aggrieved by any aspect of the resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation program, he/she can lodge an oral or written grievance with&#13;

publicized through posting in the affected villages and their adequacy will be monitored&#13;
throughout RAP implementation. All grievances will be recorded in standard formats.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
40.   Monitoring includes both internal and external monitoring. The primary target is&#13;
to (a) evaluate the progress of R&amp;R programs implementation, and (b) modify and&#13;
improve R&amp;R plans as necessary during implementation and evaluate the result of R&amp;R&#13;
programs.&#13;
41.   Internal Monitoring. Internal monitoring of the R&amp;R programs is part of the&#13;
overall project management. YRDPC RO will be responsible for internal monitoring,&#13;
that will be conducted through the R&amp;R institutional setup. The monitoring indicators&#13;
would include, at least, institutional capacity, R&amp;R staff training, land acquisition, land&#13;
leasing, payment of compensation, land development and redistribution, off-farm&#13;
development activities, PAP training, restoration of public facilities, relocation of&#13;
enterprises. Monitoring reports would be submitted quarterly and semiannual monitoring&#13;
reports will be submitted to the Bank as part of the overall project progress report.&#13;
Detailed reporting formats have been developed and are attached to the RAPs.&#13;
42.   External Monitoring. YRDPC plans to have the Resettlement Office of Yellow&#13;
River Water Conservancy Committee (YRCCRO) as its independent external monitor for&#13;
the project. YRCCRO will set up a monitoring team for the project, staffed with 15&#13;
resettlement specialists including 5 senior staff. External monitoring would focus on&#13;
(a) the physical progress of RAP implementation, (b) evaluation of livelihood restoration&#13;
and living standard improvement, (c) PAP participation and consultation during&#13;
implementation, (d) effectiveness of grievances redress mechanism and (e) proposing&#13;
measures for improvement.&#13;
43.   External monitoring will be conducted through regular consultation meetings with&#13;
the affected communities, regular field visits, structured and random sampling of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-154 -                                ANNEX6&#13;
affected persons on living standard. Living standard will be monitored on a sample basis.&#13;
A data base will be maintained and updated twice a year with first hand data. Two living&#13;
standard surveys will be conducted among the affected population, one after two years of&#13;
resettlement completion and one at the completion of the project. YRCCRO will submit&#13;
its semiannual monitoring reports to YRDPCRO and the Bank throughout the project&#13;
implementation  period.   Detailed  monitoring  indicators, survey  questionnaires  and&#13;
reporting formats have been developed and attached to the RAPs.&#13;
44.    Environmental and Resettlement Advisory Panel. The project has established&#13;
a seven-member international Environment And Resettlement Advisory Panel. The panel&#13;
will meet twice a year to review R&amp;R progress, propose measures for improvements.&#13;
The panel will submit its report to both the project management and the Bank.&#13;
Costs&#13;
45.     The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement under the project is estimated at&#13;
Y 51.33 million, of which Y 36.80 million cover rural resettlement, Y 3.30 million cover&#13;
relocation of enterprises and Y 11.24 million cover the remaining cost items. Total cost&#13;
is allocated across project components as follows: Y 7.33 million for GMT, Y 12.41&#13;

46.   All compensation will be paid before acquisition and a disbursement procedure&#13;
has been established to ensure timely payment of compensation. YRDPC RO will pay&#13;
the funds for land acquisition and resettlement to its field offices, who will disburse the&#13;
funds to CROs. CROs will deliver the funds directly to villages, who will use land&#13;
compensation for productive purpose and pay the PAPs for their private assets lost.&#13;
E. EVALUATION OF COMPLETED R&amp;R UNDER THE PROJECT&#13;
Land Acquisition And Resettlement&#13;
47.   Land acquisition for the GMT has been completed. Land acquired included&#13;
1,129 mu of cultivated land, 67 mu of riverbank land, 420 mu of rotation land, 7 mu of&#13;
orchards, 99 mu of forest land and 69 mu of bush land. A total of 714 mu of land were&#13;
leased. A total amount of Y 6.87 million have been paid for compensation. Some&#13;
114 mu of land have been acquired in seven villages for the SMT and the total amount of&#13;
compensation paid is Y 0.28 million.&#13;
48.   The resettlement of the 16 households is completed. The PAPs are resettled&#13;
within the same village. Their new houses are larger in area and of better quality.&#13;
Livelihood Development Activities&#13;
49.   Land development has been going on. So far 1,560 mu of land have been&#13;
redistributed in the affected villages including the newly developed and terraced land.&#13;
Land development will be completed in October 2001.&#13;
50.   The project improved the infrastructure in the villages along the transmission line.&#13;
Three highways have been constructed in Pianguan County with a total length of 127 km&#13;
and one road has been rehabilitated with a length of 25 km. As a result, 23 villages have&#13;
become accessible through the new highways. The project has drilled 12 deep wells&#13;
along the GMT and has provided 3,000 people and 750 large animals in 10 villages along&#13;
the line with drinking and irrigation water. The project helped with the power supply for&#13;
over 400 households by building over 6 km of transmission lines.&#13;
Living Standard Survey&#13;
51.  In April 1996, Tianjin Water Resources and Hydroelectric Design Institute of&#13;
MWR conducted a survey to evaluate living standard improvement among PAPs along&#13;
the GMT and the SMT and local economic development with the project. The survey is&#13;
undertaken by random sampling 26 percent of PAP households and collecting data&#13;
through secondary sources. The survey indicates a remarkable improvement in living&#13;
standards of the PAPs and fast economic development in Pianguan County with the&#13;
project:&#13;
(a)   Diversified sources of income. The number of households with no other&#13;
source of income than farming dropped from 82 percent in 1992 to 12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-156 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
percent. Most of the families have either opened family business, sideline&#13;
activities or have members working as temporary laborers.&#13;
(b)   Increase of average per capita income from Y 100 to Y 833 in 1992 to&#13;
Y 625 to Y 5,000 in 1995. While 59 percent of the households had an&#13;
average annual per capita income of below Y 500 in 1992, 1995 witnessed&#13;
59 percent of them enjoying an average per capita income of over Y 3,000.&#13;
(c)   An impressive possession of modem electronic apparatus and vehicles&#13;
such as color TVs, small tractors, refrigerators, stereo systems, motor&#13;
bikes and washing machines, rare before the project started.&#13;
(d)   Improved housing conditions with better quality and larger area.&#13;
(e)   Access to clean drinking water.&#13;
(f)   The 152 km of highway have created a transport network within Pianguan&#13;
County connecting 15 townships and have greatly improved transportation&#13;
for the affected villages.&#13;
(g)   With the project, the number of construction companies in the county&#13;
jumped from 67 before the project to 189 in 1996 with the total revenue&#13;
increased by 400 percent. Private transport businesses increased from 58&#13;
in 1992 to 1406 in 1996 while the number of restaurants went up by 300&#13;
percent.&#13;
(h)   Since the project started construction, new  enterprises have been&#13;
established, including 2 cement plants, 35 quarries, 21 kilns, 46 brick&#13;
factories and 50 new shops along project transmission lines with about&#13;
4,500 employees.&#13;
F. WANJIAZHAI DAM AND RESERVOIR PROJECT&#13;
Introduction&#13;
52.   Wanjiazhai Multipurpose Dam and Reservoir Project (WJZP) is a local project&#13;
financed by the Ministry of Water Resources, Shanxi Province and Nei Mongol Region.&#13;
It is located on the Yellow River, which separates Shanxi Province and Nei Mongol&#13;
Region. The reservoir would provide 1.4 billion m3 annually to the area. Shanxi&#13;
Province plans to channel its share of water through the project, to be financed by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
53.   The reservoir damsite construction affected three villages. Its resettlement started&#13;
in 1993 and was completed in 1996. Reservoir inundation would affect 60 villages in&#13;
two counties and one banner and 90 percent of the affected population are in Qinshuihe&#13;
County in Nei Mongol Region.&#13;
&#13;

Resettlement Planning&#13;
54.      Inventory and Socioeconomic Surveys.  Resettlement planning started in 1989.&#13;
The census survey was conducted in February 1990, updated in 1993 and 1996. The&#13;
census was carried out by the Regional, county, township resettlement offices and design&#13;
institutes. Villagers participated actively in the surveys.&#13;
55.      Resettlement Impacts. The project will submerge 60 villages in 10 townships in&#13;
three counties, inundating 5,171 mu of farmland. A total population of 6,047 will have to&#13;
be resettled including 4,645 PAPs losing houses and 1,402 persons only losing land. The&#13;
main categories of losses and the number of affected population is detailed in Table 8.&#13;
56.      Resettlement Objectives.   Resettlement action  plans were  prepared  for each&#13;
county by county resettlement offices. The overall objective of resettlement is the&#13;
restoration and improvement of the current living standards of the resettlers and will be&#13;
materialize through four specific targets of (a) economic development in reaching, at&#13;
least, the same level of the hosting population in average per capita output value, income&#13;
and grain consumption; (b) social development with an enhanced level of education,&#13;
technology, improved health services, better health and rehabilitated and improved&#13;
infrastructure in transportation, telecommunication and power; (c) environment&#13;
development in expanded forest coverage, reduced earth erosion and better treatment of&#13;
gas and water pollution in the resettlement areas.&#13;

57.   Resettlement. Based on the analysis of local resources, environment carrying&#13;
capacity and infrastructure conditions, resettlement strategy has been worked out for each&#13;
of the affected villages. Affected persons will be resettled within the same village as&#13;
much as possible and 813 persons will be resettled this way. Where outside resettlement&#13;
is necessary, the villages will be moved as a whole. After field investigations and close&#13;
consultation with both the resettlers and host communities, the resettlement offices have&#13;
identified 21 resettlement sites for 5,669 persons. Detailed survey and design have been&#13;
completed for each resettlement site, covering residential houses, public facilities, water&#13;
supply and sewage system, power transmission lines, broadcasting lines, road and&#13;
irrigation facilities. PAPs will be provided allowances for transportation, income loss&#13;
during transportation and subsidy for medical care.&#13;
58.   The principle of rehabilitating the affected enterprises is to restore their current&#13;
productive capacity. The design institutes worked with the affected enterprises and has&#13;
drawn up different rehabilitation schemes for each of the enterprises. The cost of&#13;
rehabilitation is fully budgeted, including compensation for lost assets, relocation cost,&#13;
compensation for profit loss and etc.  Many of the enterprises plan to take this&#13;
opportunity for technical renovation.&#13;
59.   Rehabilitation schemes have been worked out for affected infrastructure.&#13;
Relevant design institutes have estimated the replacement cost and have designed the&#13;
reconstruction of the infrastructure. The reconstruction cost is fully budgeted in the&#13;
project resettlement cost.&#13;
60.   Tianjin Hydropower Design Institute and Nei Mongol Archaeology Research&#13;
Institute conducted a survey on cultural relics and have drawn up an action plan for&#13;
protection, relocation and retrieving the relics.&#13;
61.   Livelihood Development. Livelihood rehabilitation will be conducted for 6,430&#13;
people (in the year of moving), including 5,085 people in agriculture, 1,210 people in&#13;
industries, service sector and 135 people opting for self-employment. Agricultural&#13;
development has been planned in detail for each resettlement site. All plots of land have&#13;
been identified and surveyed.  Irrigation facilities have been designed for land&#13;
development. It is planned to develop and improve 13,941 mu of low-yielding land, to&#13;
develop 5,511 mu of irrigated land, 4,686 mu of dry land and 3,017 mu of grassland.&#13;
Industrial jobs will be provided to 746 PAPs (total population is 1,210, including&#13;
children) in new enterprises or existing enterprises to be expanded. These enterprises&#13;
have been identified. Feasibility studies have been conducted for each of them and&#13;
approved by county governments.  These factories will sign contracts with the&#13;
resettlement offices for employing the PAPs and they cannot unilaterally dismiss any&#13;
PAPs. Part of the power profits will be set aside as a special fund to support PAPs in&#13;
their livelihood development.&#13;
Cost and Budget&#13;

Resettlement Implementation Arrangements&#13;
63.      Organization.   A  multilevel institution  has been  set up  for WJZ  resettlement&#13;
implementation.   The resettlement office  in  WJZ  Reservoir Construction  and&#13;
Management (WRCM), under the guidance of the Resettlement Office of Ministry of&#13;
Water Resources, is responsible for the WJZ resettlement implementation. Both Shanxi&#13;
and Nei Mongol have established resettlement offices at provincial, prefecture, county&#13;
and township level. The resettlement office of WRCM will operate as the supervisor of&#13;
the WJZ resettlement implementation, and will monitor resettlement progress. The&#13;
county resettlement office would undertake internal monitoring on resettlement progress.&#13;
YRCCRO will be contracted as the independent external monitor for R&amp;R monitoring&#13;
and evaluation. The Environment and Resettlement Panel will also review the progress&#13;
of WJZ  Reservoir  resettlement progress.   Detailed  monitoring  indicators, reporting&#13;
requirements and formats have been developed and attached to the RAP.&#13;
64.      Implementation  Schedule.   Resettlement schedule  is  detailed  with  reservoir&#13;
impounding schedule. Resettlement is to be completed by the end of 1998 and livelihood&#13;
development activities will continue till 2000. A detailed CPM schedule is developed&#13;
and attached to the RAP.&#13;

Damsite Resettlement Evaluation&#13;
65.   The construction of the dam, started in 1994, affected three villages, i.e.,&#13;
Wanjiazhai in Shanxi Province on the left bank and Yaozimaoshen, Shidaoqingshen in&#13;
the Nei Mongol Region on the right bank. The census survey was completed in early&#13;
1993. A resettlement action plan was prepared respectively for the Left Bank and Right&#13;
villages and was approved by the Ministry of Water Conservancy (MWC) in December&#13;
1993. Resettlement offices have been established in Wanjiazhai Project Construction&#13;
Corporation, the affected counties and townships to coordinate and implement land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement.&#13;
66.   Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The project acquired 7,482 mu of land,&#13;
including 5,706 mu of cultivated land affecting 664 persons. Land acquisition was&#13;
completed by 1995 and compensation was fully disbursed. Twenty-four people in 6&#13;
households who lost houses to the project have resettled in new houses. The income&#13;
rehabilitation component is 80 percent completed and will be completed by the end of&#13;
1997. The total cost for land acquisition and resettlement was estimated at Y 26.82&#13;
million and has been fully paid. The budget was later adjusted to Y 34.80 million with&#13;
increased compensation rates. An additional Y 7.98 million is to be disbursed to the&#13;
affected villages.&#13;
67.   Livelihood Development. Livelihood development is planned through on-farm&#13;
and off-farm activities. For the two villages on the right bank, the planned development&#13;
of 1,640 mu of wasteland has been completed and distributed to affected villagers, raising&#13;
their per capita land holding above preproject level.&#13;
68.   For the Wanjiazhai Village on the left bank, the arrangement is (a) to develop land&#13;
for on-farm activities for 111 PAPs, including 50 mu for vegetable, 10 mu for nursery,&#13;
100 mu for orchard, 300 mu for fruit trees, melons and corn; (b) to develop animal&#13;
husbandry for 63 PAPs (pigs, sheep, cows, chickens, fisheries); (c) to provide&#13;
employment for 30 PAPs in service industry; and (d) to provide industrial employment&#13;
for 44 PAPs (food processing plants and bean product processing). Fifty-eight old people&#13;
are on pension arrangement. R&amp;R is well in progress and 80 percent of livelihood&#13;
development activities have been finished. They are expected to be completed by the end&#13;
of 1997.&#13;
69.   Living Standard Survey. The living standard survey conducted in the three&#13;
villages indicates a significant improvement of living standards, infrastructure and public&#13;
facilities. The sample survey shows a sharp increase in household income. Wanjiazhai&#13;
Village saw an average per capita annual income increase from Y 127 in 1990 terms to&#13;
Y 1,200 in 1995. The three villages are now enjoying greatly improved infrastructure,&#13;
such as road, telecommunication facilities, water supply system, education and health&#13;
care facilities.&#13;

ANNEX 7: PROJECT ECONOMICS&#13;
A. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND WATER DEMAND&#13;
1.    Taiyuan is Shanxi Province's capital, largest city, and principal industrial&#13;
complex. The area to be served by the WWTP Phase I includes Taiyuan City, the north&#13;
and south suburbs, and the adjacent county of Gujiao. Combined, the urban population&#13;
was 1,672,000 in 1993, and the rural population, 532,000. Taiyuan had 7.2 percent of&#13;
Shanxi's population in 1993, but produced 18.3 percent of its industrial output, including&#13;
11.2 percent of coal, 14.6 percent of electricity, 31.2 percent of chemicals, 48.0 percent of&#13;
metallurgical products, and 28.8 percent of other industrial output.&#13;
2.    Table 7.1 reports current and future population, industrial output, and water&#13;
demands by consuming sector as projected by YRDP staff and the Tianjin Design&#13;
Institute. These projections have been carefully worked out using projected population&#13;
and industrial growth rates, and water consumption "norms" used in China-wide planning&#13;
exercises. Combined, they show total water consumption increasing from 437 million m&#13;
in 1993 to 784 in 2000, 1,000 in 2010, and 1,196 in 2010, with implied compound rates&#13;
of growth of 8.7 percent between 1993 and 2000, 2.5 percent between 2000 and 2010,&#13;
and 1.8 percent after 2010.&#13;
3.    There are two significant problems with these forecasts. First, they undoubtedly&#13;
understate both growth in population and industrial output in the early years of the&#13;
forecasts. We know that the Taiyuan urban population has been growing in excess of 3&#13;
percent per year, but the projections use only a 1.2 percent rate for the entire period 1993-&#13;
2000. We also know that industrial growth has been averaging 15 percent in recent years,&#13;
while the projections assume only 8 percent from 1993 to 2000. These considerations&#13;
imply that the forecasts are far too conservative. Second, the projections ignore any&#13;
impacts of price on demand. Prices of both household and industrial water supplies have&#13;
been increased recently, and are scheduled to rise much faster in the near future.&#13;
Heretofore, water prices were so low that there was no need for a distinction between&#13;
projected "consumption" and projected "demand". But with household water prices&#13;
scheduled to triple, and industrial water prices scheduled to more than quadruple, this&#13;
distinction becomes important. For these reasons, the forecasts have been recomputed,&#13;
taking into account both the recent growth in population and industrial activity, and the&#13;
influence of the projected higher prices.  The changes will affect only the main&#13;
consuming sectors industries and households which includes municipal water&#13;
consumption. At the same time, we will produce a range of forecasts-low, medium, and&#13;
high-recognizing the inherent difficulty of making such projections in a rapidly&#13;
changing area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-162 -                      ANNEX7&#13;
4.    The assumptions about the growth in Taiyuan's population, industrial capacity,&#13;
and water consumption are shown in the top part of Table 7.2. Those assumptions&#13;
pertaining to household and municipal (H&amp;M) water demand are taken from projections&#13;
prepared by the Taiyuan Water Company, which rely on the most recent data available,&#13;
and contain assumptions relevant to the local economy. Combined, the assumptions&#13;
produce the forecasts for H&amp;M demand shown in the bottom left portion of Table 7.2.&#13;
The "medium" case, which we expect will have the highest probability of proving true, is&#13;
somewhat higher than the YRDP/TDI projections given in Table 7.1. The difference is&#13;
mainly due to the higher population growth rates assumed (which more closely match&#13;
recent trends), and to the inclusion of "municipal" demands (firefighting, urban landscape&#13;
requirements, etc.) which the YRDP/TDI projections omitted.&#13;
5.    The middle part of Table 7.2 gives the assumptions pertaining to the revised&#13;
industrial water demand forecasts. Whereas YRDP/TDI assumed an 8 percent growth in&#13;
industrial activity until 2000, slowing to 5 percent and ultimately 4 percent, the Mission&#13;
feels this assumption is conservative, and may be characterized as the "low" case. The&#13;
preferred "medium" case assumes a 10 percent growth after 1995 (1993-95 averaged 18&#13;
percent), then slowing to 7.5 percent and finally 5 percent after 2010. The assumptions&#13;
about growth in the productivity of industrial water approximate those of YRDP/TDI.&#13;
The higher growth rates would have produced a higher demand forecast except for the&#13;
influence of the higher prices which have been taken into account. We have assumed a&#13;
price elasticity of -0.1, which results in, for example, the 2000 water consumption&#13;
declining from 530 million m in 2000 to only 327 because prices for industrial water are&#13;
scheduled to increase from about Y 1.0/mi3 to 5.8 (YRDP/TDI projected demand in 2000&#13;
to be 382 ignoring any price effects). The low (in absolute value) elasticity assumed is&#13;
justified for several reasons. First, Taiyuan's firms have already made great strides in&#13;
reducing consumption per unit of output in reaction to physical water shortages. Second,&#13;
even the higher prices will not significantly affect profits of most industries, as water&#13;
costs will remain a small part of total costs. Third, the assumption that there will be&#13;
continuing productivity gains with or without price changes implies that there will be&#13;
ongoing, long-term adjustments to both price and probable future shortages which the&#13;
Project will be unable to eradicate in total.&#13;
6.    The bottom part of Table 7.2 show the water demands used for the economic&#13;
analysis for H&amp;M, Industry, and the categories combined. We assume that the rural&#13;
consumption of humans and livestock will be met by local surface water and&#13;
groundwater, and that all irrigation demands will be met from these sources plus treated&#13;
wastewater from the Project, as discussed below.&#13;

B. WATER RESOURCES&#13;
7.      Taiyuan's water resources may be classified as surface and groundwater. Surface&#13;
water resources include local runoff and diversions from the Fen Reservoir, located 50&#13;
km upstream of Taiyuan City. Local runoff is primarily usable only by agriculture,&#13;
because there are no water storage facilities of consequence other than Fen reservoir. The&#13;
reservoir directly supplies, via a dedicated pipeline, about 36.5 million m3/year to Gujiao,&#13;
an industrial/mining complex north of Taiyuan. Virtually all of the remaining supplies&#13;
are diverted to the large irrigation districts bordering the Fen River. These irrigation areas&#13;
are also suffering severe water shortages: only 80 percent of irrigable land received any&#13;
water in most years, and supplies are only half those required for optimal yields. In recent&#13;
years, runoff to the Fen has been low and apparently declining, due to extensive terracing&#13;
upstream to limit erosion, and construction of small-scale dams. Compared to long term&#13;
trends, each of the of the years 1989-93 is classified "P95" (very dry) because local&#13;
runoff has averaged less than 50 million m3 compared to a long-term  average of 127.&#13;
This water source is not considered a viable alternative to WWTP as a supply source for&#13;
Taiyuan because (a) further curtailment of water supplies to the irrigation districts would&#13;
further exacerbate poverty and unemployment, (b) there are no physical diversion&#13;
structures in place at present to supply the City, and (c) the available supplies would be&#13;
far from sufficient to alleviate Taiyuan's present and projected shortages.&#13;
8.      As  shown  in  Table  7.3, Taiyuan  relies- on  groundwater for most of its&#13;
consumption. In 1991, 83 percent of consumption by households, municipal entities, and&#13;
industries came from groundwater, with the percentage rising to 87 percent in 1993. The&#13;

Gujiao diversions from Fen Reservoir are included in the "surface" category; without&#13;
them, the percentage from groundwater in 1993 is 97 percent. Sustainable groundwater&#13;
supplies have been estimated at 307 million m3/year for the entire Project Area, of which&#13;
35 million m3 are used outside the City for irrigation and "rural life" purposes, leaving&#13;
272 as the long term groundwater resource available. In 1993, Taiyuan's consumption&#13;
from groundwater exceeded 312 million m3, implying overextraction of 15 percent. In&#13;
fact, groundwater extraction has exceeded the sustainable level in every year since 1989,&#13;
a situation which cannot continue much longer without dire environmental consequences.&#13;

C. WATER SHORTAGES&#13;
9.     In 1993, water consumption in Taiyuan totaled 437 million m3. If the measurable&#13;
shortages in the urban and industrial sectors are included, water demand was at least 538&#13;
million m', for a deficit of 101. If there had been no overdraft of groundwater, the&#13;
shortage would have been 146 million m', or 27 percent of demand. In addition, farmers&#13;
in the project areas were getting only about one-third of the fresh water they needed (part&#13;
of their deficits were made up by using untreated sewage and industrial wastewater),&#13;
implying the true deficit was over 30 percent.&#13;
10.    Combining the household, municipal, and industry water demand projections of&#13;
section A and the sustainable local groundwater supplies available to meet these demands&#13;
we can predict the future water shortages as shown in Table 7.4. The middle part of the&#13;
Table represents the volumes which the WWTP will attempt to supply.&#13;

D. ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROJECT&#13;
11.   If economic growth in the Project Area is to continue, and the urban population is&#13;
to receive adequate supplies of water, additional sources of water must be found.&#13;
Potential sources include (a) more intense use of local water, (b) importing surface water,&#13;
and (c) reallocation of existing water from other uses (irrigation).&#13;
Local Water&#13;
12.   There is strong evidence that groundwater is already overexploited, and has been&#13;
since the late 1980s. The evidence comes from both a comparison of extractions with&#13;
estimates of sustainable yields, and from observations of declining water tables and&#13;
increasing incidence of land subsidence. The question is not whether increased extraction&#13;
of groundwater can be tolerated, but whether current levels can be sustained to the year&#13;
2000 when the Project water is scheduled to become available.&#13;
13.   Taiyuan City is situated near the upper end of the Upper Fen Basin, an enclosed&#13;
hydrological entity that relies almost entirely on snowmelt and far upper reach runoff for&#13;
the river flow. There is negligible offtake above Taiyuan City and its northern suburbs,&#13;
but virtually unlimited demand for water in and around Taiyuan and downstream for&#13;
irrigation. The utilization rate has been as high as 74 percent in recent years, which is&#13;
probably the highest in the Yellow River Basin, and cannot be increased given the&#13;
seasonality of flows and high sediment content during flood periods. This level of&#13;
utilization has resulted in the river bed often running dry much of the year, and a dramatic&#13;
decline in the irrigation supplies to downstream farmers.&#13;
Importing Surface Water&#13;
14.   The alternative sources for importing surface water are either from adjacent&#13;
subbasins within Shanxi, or from the Yellow River. Conceivably, Taiyuan could receive&#13;
water diverted from the adjacent Northwest or Hotuohe basins. Two factors make these&#13;
options virtually impossible. First, water shortages are prevalent throughout northern&#13;
Shanxi, and are intensifying everywhere. Only in the west is excess surface flows&#13;
projected, and these occur mostly in flood season drain directly to the Yellow, at points&#13;
remote from the Taiyuan water demand center. Second, the division of Shanxi into&#13;
subbasins follows the pattern of intervening mountain ranges, which would need to&#13;
crossed if water were to be diverted. These ranges are as high as 3,000 m and would&#13;
involve insurmountable technical and economic difficulties.&#13;
15.   The above discussion implies that only importation of water from the Yellow by a&#13;
project such as Wanjiazhai can meet the projected water demands. Alternatives neither&#13;
can supply the volumes required, or would pose even greater difficulties and higher costs&#13;
than Wanjiazhai. Is, however, Wanjiazhai the best location on the Yellow for the&#13;
diversions? It is probably the only location that is feasible. Above Wanjiazhai the&#13;
Yellow River turns westward, requiring longer and more costly diversion route, and one&#13;
that encroaches on Nei Mongol. Below Wanjiazhai, the Loess Plateau begins with its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-167 -                     ANNEX7&#13;
associated runoff with high silt concentrations, which would engender prohibitively high&#13;
treatment costs.&#13;
Reallocation of Existing Water&#13;
16.  In 1993 irrigation accounted for 83 million m3 (19.0 percent of total consumption)&#13;
in Taiyuan. Only about half of this was fresh water. Downstream of Taiyuan the major&#13;
irrigation districts (Fen-I and 2) receive about 200 million m3/year diverted from the Fen&#13;
Reservoir. In these areas as well as the entire Province, irrigation consumption as a&#13;
percentage of total consumption has been declining as water has been diverted to&#13;
municipal and industrial uses or sold by farmers who have water rights. However, not all&#13;
of the current irrigation supplies could be diverted to M&amp;I uses. Irrigation demands are&#13;
seasonal, peaking in the Spring months, whereas M&amp;I demands are relatively constant&#13;
throughout the year. The larger irrigated areas are not located near the cities, so that&#13;
measurable reallocation would require investments in both surface water storage and&#13;
conveyance. Those irrigated areas located near Taiyuan supply important and valuable&#13;
produce to the City, supplies which would be difficult and costly to procure elsewhere.&#13;
But the most important reason why reallocation from irrigation should not be pursued has&#13;
to do with poverty alleviation. Most of Shanxi's poor are rural, and most rural residents&#13;
rely on agriculture for the bulk of their incomes. Without irrigation, agriculture in Shanxi&#13;
is a precarious undertaking because of low and unpredictable rainfall. Irrigated yields are&#13;
double those of rainfed land, and could be much higher were irrigation water available in&#13;
ample supplies. Agricultural incomes are probably quadrupled when crops can be&#13;
irrigated. In 1994, farm wages were only 33 percent of wages in manufacturing. Thus,&#13;
any further reallocation of water from farmers would have serious negative income&#13;
effects on this group which is already the poorest of Shanxi. Furthermore, the volumes&#13;
involved would still be insufficient to meet the projected deficits in Taiyuan.&#13;
The "Do Nothing" Alternative&#13;
17.   With current water shortages in Taiyuan amounting to 30 percent or more of&#13;
estimated demand, and growing rapidly, and both ground and surface water supplies&#13;
declining, failure to complete the project would engender economic, social, and&#13;
environmental calamity. If Taiyuan's urban and rural residents are allocated supplies&#13;
equally YRDP's projected demands, then no fresh water would be left for agriculture, and&#13;
industrial output would fall far short of its potential:&#13;

The impact would be felt throughout China given the heavy reliance on northern Shanxi's&#13;
coal, heavy industry, and chemical output. Hundreds of thousands of skilled workers&#13;

would need to be relocated, and vast quantities of mineral and fossil resources would go&#13;
unexploited. It is not surprising that Chinese planners have mentioned the possibility that&#13;
Taiyuan (and Datong as well) would need to relocated (at incalculable cost) if project&#13;
water is not forthcoming.&#13;
E. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
18.   Benefits arise primarily from water shortage alleviation in the industrial and urban&#13;
consumption sectors. There may be secondary health benefits, but these have not been&#13;
quantified. Farmers near the project areas would benefit from additional supplies of&#13;
treated sewage and wastewater. There would also be environmental benefits because the&#13;
additional water would halt the overexploitation of groundwater. In the following&#13;
sections we describe how the economic benefits of YRDP water are estimated for its&#13;
intended uses for urban consumption, industry, and possibly, irrigation. In general, we&#13;
will seek to obtain marginal economic values based on sound economic principles&#13;
applied to the situation pertaining in the project areas. Furthermore, we will take a&#13;
conservative approach where a choice is obvious, preferring to err on the low side of&#13;
benefit estimation.&#13;
Value of Water in Urban Consumption&#13;
19.   The use of water receiving the highest priority from local policymakers is for&#13;
3&#13;
human consumption. In 1994, urban households in Taiyuan consumed 59.24 million m3,&#13;
and rural households, 14.6, in the project area. In terms of liters per day, the urban figure&#13;
is 91.5 per capita, which is less than half the China norm of 200 for the year 2000. Even&#13;
so, the consumption figure includes items that are not strictly household consumption,&#13;
such as household-based commerce. Recent survey work shows that about half of&#13;
Taiyuan households consumed less than 40 liters/day. The per capita consumption by&#13;
rural residents amounts to 18 liters per day, while the norm for 2000 is 70. Based on&#13;
departure from China-wide norms, it is clear that both groups suffer severe shortages that&#13;
can only worsen in the absence of the YRDP.&#13;
20.   The analysis below will derive the value of water to urban consumers, and assume&#13;
that this value will also apply to the much smaller group of rural households in the project&#13;
area.&#13;
21.   A commonly used measure of the benefits from household consumption is&#13;
willingness-to-pay (WTP). If consumers state, directly or indirectly that they are willing&#13;
to pay so much for a unit of water, then that value is commonly taken as the benefit for&#13;
project analysis. Sometimes consumer surveys provide estimates of WTP, sometimes a&#13;
lower bound on WTP can be inferred from what other consumers in similar situations are&#13;
paying. In China, urban water consumers are paying Y 1.8/mi3 in some coastal cities of&#13;
size similar to Taiyuan.&#13;
22.   Alternatively, WTP can be estimated from consumer demand functions if the&#13;
required data are available. The method is illustrated in Figure 7.1.&#13;

Po  ' ' '&#13;
Q0  Qd           volume/year&#13;
The point Po, Qo is observed. For Taiyuan, total "urban life" consumption in 1994 was&#13;
110.8 million m3, adjusted to 77.56 to allow for 30 percent losses in distribution. Given&#13;
the existence of shortages and intermittent supplies, we know that (Po,Qo) is a point&#13;
interior to the urban demand function, DD'. We first seek a point on DD' for the current&#13;
price of 0.7. The China norm of 200 for cities of Taiyuan's size gives an approximation,&#13;
implying that (0.7,129.5) is a point on DD' pertaining to 1994. In the figure, this is&#13;
represented as Po,Qd. Given an estimate of the price elasticity of demand, i, we can&#13;
trace out the complete demand function. For a constant elasticity function, the formula is&#13;
Q=AP'T, where A is a constant. A typical short-run value for ii is 0.2.7 Solving for A, we&#13;
can complete the demand function (A=120.6). WTP, the point on the demand function&#13;
corresponding to the current supply, is Y 9.09/m3. This high value, however, depends in&#13;
large part on the highly inelastic short-run elasticity assumed. Furthermore, WTP is valid&#13;
for only small changes in supply, not the very large changes envisaged by the Project.&#13;
23.   When changes in supply are large, the appropriate measure of benefits is&#13;
consumers plus (plus the underlying price). In the short run conditions applying to 1994,&#13;
CS is Y 4.19/m3, which, when added to the price of 0.7, yields a value Y 4.89/m3. In the&#13;
longer run, it is widely recognized that price elasticities are less inelastic because&#13;
consumers have time to adjust habits and replace water-using appliances. In general,&#13;
long run elasticities are taken to be twice (in absolute value) of short run, which, other&#13;
things equal, results in lower values for both WTP and CS.&#13;
24.   Table 7.5 extrapolates the data over time. Column (2) is the projection for urban&#13;
population in the Taiyuan Project Area, which is assumed to continue to grow at 3&#13;
7 Price elasticities of demand are notoriously difficult to estimate because of the influence of a variety of&#13;
nonprice factors: 0.2 is within the range of many estimates from developed countries.&#13;

percent until 2000, 2 percent for the next decade, and 1 percent thereafter. Column (3) is&#13;
target consumption norm, and column (4) is the implied annual demand net of losses.&#13;
Column (5) is the annual deficit assuming that water supplies cannot grow from their&#13;
1994 levels in the absence of the project. Column (6) is the assumed price elasticity,&#13;
which increases in absolute to reach -0.4 by 2001, the first year of Project water supply.&#13;
Column (7) is the computed demand function constant term. Column (8) is the calculated&#13;
WTP for the Qo supply, (9) is the CS per cubic meter, and (10) is the implied value.&#13;
Note that until 2001, the increase in elasticity outweighs the increase in demand, so that&#13;
both WTP and CS decline. After 2000, the elasticity is assumed constant, and demand&#13;
growth causes WTP and CS to grow thereafter.&#13;

WTP is Y 4.13/m3, while by the CS measure, it is Y 2.41/m3.  Again, WTP would be&#13;
valid for a small increase in supply. But the Project will result in a doubling of&#13;
consumption over what would be possible without it, so we must take the more&#13;
conservative measure of CS. In other words, WTP effectively assumes a perfectly elastic&#13;

demand function, which does not introduce a large error for small changes in Q, but&#13;
certainly does so when the changes are large.&#13;
26.   The consumers' surplus values are adopted for the measure of benefits from&#13;
increased urban consumption brought about by YRDP, and will be applied to the rural&#13;
consumers as well. From Y 2.41/m3 in 2001, they rise continuously over time as&#13;
population growth causes a rightward shift in the demand function.&#13;
27.   Column (10) shows the current price for household water, and the schedule of&#13;
price increases adopted by the Shanxi Province Commodity Price Bureau. By 2000, the&#13;
Bureau will be charging Y 3.66/mi3 for household water, a price designed to capture most&#13;
of the cost of Project water. The above analysis shows that this price is between the WTP&#13;
pertaining in 2001 (4.13) and the CS for that year (2.41). CS will reach the administered&#13;
price about the year 2010.&#13;

The Value of Industrial Consumption&#13;
28.   Of all water-consuming sectors, only industry has the potential to generate&#13;
sufficiently high economic returns to justify the Project. A rudimentary procedure,&#13;
summarized in Table 7.6, indicates that the returns might be in the neighborhood of&#13;
Y 34/m3. In this table, we simply take the average, weighted by projected water use by&#13;
industrial sector, of value added per unit of water. (The average return will be equal to&#13;
marginal return up to some point because of the existence of present and future water&#13;
shortages leading to underutilized capacity.)&#13;

weighted average industrial sectors:    67.31&#13;
29.    Apart from  shadow-pricing, to which we will return, the main reason why this&#13;
method is likely to be erroneous has to do with the interconnectedness of industries.&#13;
More than half of industrial output in Taiyuan supplies intermediate demand, i.e., is an&#13;
input to other firns' production. Consider the coal industry. For every yuan of output,&#13;
Taiyuan's coal firms buy Y 0.53 of inputs from the other sectors, which must use water in&#13;
their production of these inputs. The true marginal return to water in the coal sector&#13;
cannot be as high as Y 47, because all other sectors supplying inputs have lower returns,&#13;
and it is impossible to increase the output of coal without increasing the output of the&#13;
others.&#13;
30.    A  convenient method of analyzing the industrial sector is through the use of&#13;
Input-Output (1-0) models for the following reasons:&#13;
*  1-0 models provide a consistent accounting framework&#13;
*  1-0 models explicitly recognize the interconnectedness of most economic&#13;
activity&#13;
*  1-0 models can easily be linked with more rigorous analytical techniques such&#13;
as linear programming&#13;
Input-Output modeling has a rich background in China. It proved highly useful in central&#13;
planning, and continues to be used to produce economic forecasts.8 A significant boon to&#13;
this study is the existence of both a Shanxi I-0 model and models for all of China which&#13;
have recently been projected up to 2020. The Shanxi model was originally developed for&#13;
1987 conditions, then updated to 1990. It consists of 28 sectors, and includes important&#13;

detail on water demands.9 The China-wide models were developed for a World Bank-&#13;
sponsored study on greenhouse gas emissions, contain 18 sectors, and are available for&#13;
1990 plus projected versions to 2000, 2010, and 2020. Together, these models permit us&#13;
to develop a projected Shanxi model aggregated to the level of detail appropriate for the&#13;
analysis of the project.&#13;
31.   In its basic form, an 1-0 table of n sectors consists of a transactions matrix T of n&#13;
rows and n columns, where each element tij is the purchases of sector i from sector j in the&#13;
measured year. The sum of any column of T is the total purchased inputs of that sector,&#13;
and the sum of any row is the total intermediate products of the sector represented in that&#13;
row. The basic table is completed by noting that the total output of each sector may be&#13;
divided into that part which meets other industries' inputs, and that component which is&#13;
final demand. In matrix notation,&#13;
£jTjj + Yj = Xi&#13;
where X is total output and Y is final demand. In a regional 1-0 table, Y is typically&#13;
expressed as Y* + E - M where Y* is local final demand, E are exports from the region,&#13;
and M are imports to the region. In this analysis we need not be concerned with regional&#13;
trade flows, so the collapsed form will be used. Thus a negative Y1 implies that M i &gt;E j,&#13;
(the region is a net importer of the sector's product). Another most useful identity is that&#13;
the sum of a given sectors' purchases, plus the payments to its factors of production, is&#13;
also equal to total output:&#13;
Xj T1J + Vj = Xj&#13;
where Vj is the sum of factor payments, or value added.&#13;
32.   The most common use of an 1-0 table is to predict the changes in the total output&#13;
and value added of an economy's sectors when an exogenous change such as an increase&#13;
in final demand occurs. Therefore, Tii is normalized by dividing each transaction of each&#13;
firm by the sum of transactions of that firm:&#13;
Aii = Tii /Ej Tii&#13;
Then, AX + Y = X, X(I-A) = Y, and X = (I-A)-'Y so that total output may be expressed&#13;
as a function of final demand. Note that the system of equations is closed and fully&#13;
interdependent. Any change in any parameter of one sector will affect all other sectors.&#13;
In particular, a change in the final demand of say, the agricultural sector, will influence&#13;
all other sectors from which agriculture purchases inputs and/or services.&#13;

33.    The full 28-sector Shanxi model contains far more detail than can be used by this&#13;
study: sectoral output and water demand has only been projected up to 2020 for six&#13;
sectors: agriculture, coal, electricity, chemicals, metallurgy, and "other" for the Project&#13;
Area; Shanxi-wide projections output has only been projected to 2000, and for these six&#13;
sectors as well. Thus the 28-sector model was first aggregated to these six sectors. Table&#13;
7.7 shows the aggregated 1990 transaction table.&#13;
34.    The Tij elements appear in the top six rows of numbers and reflect the purchases&#13;
of the sectors heading the columns from the sectors listed in the rows. For example, the&#13;
agriculture sector purchased Y 2,137 million from "itself," 41 million from the coal&#13;
sector, etc. The relative size of these elements is an indication of the interconnectedness&#13;
of the industrial system. For example, agriculture is highly dependent on the chemical&#13;
sector; the coal sector on power, chemicals, and metallurgy; and power on coal.&#13;
35.    The column "Inter(mediate) Demand" is the sum  of the row elements and is total&#13;
sales to other firms for use as inputs. Final Demand is the difference between Total&#13;
Output and Intermediate Demand, and comprises final demand by Shanxi consumers,&#13;
(plus) exports from the Province, (less) imports to the Province, and changes in stocks&#13;
over the year. From these data, it can be seen that only in the metallurgy sector is Shanxi&#13;
a net importer.&#13;

37.   Several modifications to the 1-0 table are required before it can be used for&#13;
analysis of the project. First, it must be extrapolated to the future. Second, it must be&#13;
shadow-priced. And third, it must be converted to the level of Taiyuan. Extrapolation is&#13;
necessary because the underlying coefficients change with technical progress and changes&#13;
in the orientation of industrial activity. Fortunately, this work has been done for China-&#13;
wide 1-0 tables, and we can adopt those changes to the Shanxi model. Table 7.8 tracks&#13;
the sequence of calculations involved.&#13;
38.   The procedure for obtaining the Table for 2000 is as follows: (1) compute the Ajj&#13;
matrices for the China-wide models for the years 1990 and 2000; (b) calculate the rates of&#13;
change of the coefficients as ratios; and (c) apply the ratios to the 1990 Shanxi table. The&#13;
calculations are shown in top parts of Table 7.8. The top block is the 1990 aggregated Aii&#13;
matrix described above. The second block is the ratio of 2000 coefficients to 1990&#13;
coefficients from the China-wide matrices. A departure from unity implies that changes&#13;
in interindustry relations is projected. For example, most sectors are projected to have&#13;
lower requirements for agricultural and coal inputs, and most will place a greater reliance&#13;
on "other" sectors which includes electronics, transport and communications. Projected&#13;
technical progress can be noted from the sum of the input coefficients: if these fall (as&#13;
they do in all but agriculture and coal), then the same output can be obtained in the future&#13;
with less total inputs.&#13;
39.   The projected changes we have introduced to the Shanxi Aii 1-0 matrix are&#13;
expected to have two types of effects: (1) changes in relative intersectoral demands for&#13;
inputs, and (2) evidence of an overall decline in intermediate demands relative to total&#13;
demands, i.e., technical progress in production. We now check for these effects by&#13;
applying projections in total output to the projected A1j matrices described above.&#13;
40.   The fourth block of Table 7.8 corrects for the most significant price distortions&#13;
which occur in the electricity sector. The shadow price of electricity is 35 fen/kWh&#13;
compared to an average financial price of 13.33 in the 1990 data. Therefore, the output of&#13;
the sector ELECT was increased by 35/13.33, and the value added and final demand&#13;
figures adjusted as well to maintain the identities. In addition, the ELECT row of the A1i&#13;
was adjusted upward to reflect the higher costs, and the value added of all firms&#13;
purchasing electricity reduced by a corresponding amount. The final block of Table 7.8&#13;
applies the total output projections for Taiyuan in 2000 to obtain a 2000, shadow-priced&#13;
transactions table for Taiyuan.&#13;

Input-Output and Linear Programming&#13;
41.   Despite its statistical and accounting merits, an 1-0 table cannot tell us what the&#13;
marginal value of water is to any given sector. But a simple transformation of the basic&#13;
1-0 structure into a linear programming model can.&#13;
42.   Recall that the general form of a linear programming (LP) model is&#13;
maximize Ej cjx;&#13;
subject to X- A 1j xj = bi for all j, and xj 2 0&#13;
where the xi are activity (variable) levels, cj are objective function coefficients, A is a&#13;
matrix of technical coefficients, and bi are resources available. The equality constraints&#13;
may be changed to inequalities of either direction through the implicit introduction of&#13;
slack activities.&#13;
43.   An equivalent LP model of an I-0 model is&#13;
maximize L:j vjO;&#13;
subject to Zj (I-A)1jOj = Dj where Oj are levels of sectoral output, vj are ratios of value&#13;
added to output, I is an identity matrix, Ai3 is the normalized 1-0 transactions matrix&#13;
described earlier, and Dj are final demands. Because an 1-0 model is fully closed, one&#13;
has a choice among which variables to constrain, and which to allow to vary. Either OQ or&#13;
Dj may be allowed to vary, and the model solved for the remaining set. In this example,&#13;
we first assume that the system is demand constrained, and set upper bounds on the Dj&#13;
equal to the 1990 observed levels of net final demand, and permit to Oj to vary. In&#13;
addition, we also add a set of water constraints&#13;
ij w Oi &lt; W&#13;
where wj is the amount of fresh water required per unit of output, and Wj is amount of the&#13;
water allocated to sector j. All data required for the LP model are available from Tables&#13;
7.7 and 7.8 above. A solution to the LP yields shadow prices on the W constraints which&#13;
are the derivatives of the objective function (total economic value added) with respect to&#13;
a small increase in the volume of water supplied-indeed the definition of marginal value&#13;
added.&#13;
44.   The results of these experiments, performed for each sector (except agriculture)&#13;
produce the following values:&#13;
COAL               78.9 (yuan/m3)&#13;
ELECT              43.7&#13;
CHEM               29.6&#13;
METAL              45.8&#13;
OTHER              34.5&#13;
weighted average    41.9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-178 -                       ANNEX7&#13;
Note that the weighted average value is substantially less than the 67 obtained by the&#13;
simple method earlier. Again, these values represent the impact, on value added, of an&#13;
additional unit of water focused on the listed sectors. We say focused, because all of the&#13;
increase in final output permitted by the experiment may come only from the sector&#13;
selected. Some of the additional water allocated must go to each of the other sectors, but&#13;
only to the extent that it is required to permit the increase in final demand for the selected&#13;
sector. The numbers reflect 1995 price levels with the exception of the shadow pricing&#13;
of electricity and fertilizer described earlier.&#13;
45.   First, benefits in the early years are much higher than in later years due to&#13;
discounting. Second, values for years later than 2000 become progressively lower as will&#13;
be seen in the next section.&#13;
46.   An implicit assumption in using the LP model to generate the marginal values of&#13;
water is that water is the constraint (apart from the technological relationships built into&#13;
the input-output matrix). That is, if water is available, then output could increase and&#13;
generate the values described above. In other words, there are no other constraints such&#13;
as labor or industrial capacity which could prevent these results from occurring. Clearly,&#13;
labor is not, and is not likely to become a constraint in Shanxi. Industrial capacity is not&#13;
now a constraint, as evidenced by unutilized capacity, and the projections of capacity to&#13;
2000 and beyond suggests that it will be even greater in the future. Once the existing&#13;
capacity is fully utilized with YRDP water and new capacity comes on stream, the above&#13;
values will overstate the true benefits. This is because economic theory tells us that firms&#13;
will select technology so as to equate the marginal return of an input to its expected long-&#13;
term price. If labor is expected to be very expensive in the long term, then firms will&#13;
choose capital-intensive technologies to reduce the labor cost. Likewise, firms will&#13;
choose water-using technologies based on their perception of the long-term cost of water.&#13;
3&#13;
We assume the long-term cost of water to be Y 5.8/mi. This means that, given a&#13;
sufficiently long period of time, the marginal returns of water will tend toward this value.&#13;
We further assume that plant and equipment life is 30 years, so that new plant coming&#13;
onstream in 2000 will be based on the Y 5.8 assumption.&#13;
47.   T   calculation of "old" industrial capacity, that subject to the high marginal&#13;
returns as we have estimated, is shown in Table 7.9 based on the assumptions outlined&#13;
above. The phased marginal values, based on this projection of "old" capacity, is given&#13;
in Table 7.11 for "new" (the long run water price) values of 5 and half that level. The&#13;
table shows that the average value will steadily decline and reach 5 by the year 2030&#13;
when all existing plant and equipment have been retired.&#13;

48.   Note that the Y 5 figure is not crucial to the final economic appraisal: in the early&#13;
years after 2000, most plant is of the existing variety and still subject to the high returns.&#13;
In the later years when the average marginal return declines, the benefits are heavily&#13;
discounted in the rate-of-return calculations. Furthermore, even halving the assumed&#13;
value of 5 produces an average return, for example, for Taiyuan, only 14 percent lower in&#13;
2010.&#13;
Irrigation&#13;
49.   Agricultural activity in the Project Area may be divided into (a) urban "truck&#13;
gardens" producing mainly fresh vegetables for the city, and (b) field crops produced in&#13;
the surrounding areas. In addition, there is a large irrigable area (c) south of Taiyuan&#13;
stretching all the way to the Yellow River.&#13;
50.   With the possible exception of (a), project water will be too expensive to be used&#13;
directly for irrigation. YRDP has included the demand of truck gardens in their water&#13;
demand projections, but we have separated them. They amount to 108 million m3 in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-181-                      ANNEX7&#13;
2000, 120 million m3 in 2010 and 132 in 2020. Because of the proximity to Taiyuan of&#13;
this production, and the fact that high-valued crops predominate, we assume that this&#13;
demand will receive precedenze in allocations of any available after M&amp;I demands are&#13;
met. Such water may come from excess supplies during "wet" years, or from treated and&#13;
reused wastewater. Marginal economic returns are assumed to be Y 4/m3. Under the&#13;
category (b) suburban irrigation, there are 300,000 mu within the Project Area. YRDP&#13;
demands assume an irrigation norm of 550 m3/mu and distribution losses of 40 percent.&#13;
The demands decline over time under the assumption that losses will be reduced and&#13;
efficiency of application will increase.&#13;
51.   Downstream of the Project Area lie 3.8 million mu of irrigable in the Fen Upper-&#13;
Middle Region, and 2.9 million mu in the Lower Fen Region. Projections using the&#13;
Provincial Planning Model indicate that water shortages under P75 conditions will be 43&#13;
percent in the Upper Fen and 34 percent in the Lower Pen by 2000, and growing&#13;
thereafter. Effectively, then, water demands in these areas are infinite with respect to&#13;
potential water deliveries from the Project.&#13;
52.   The Provincial Agricultural Bureau has projected cropping patterns for these areas&#13;
shown in Table 7.11, and provided farm survey materials used to produce crop budgets&#13;
for the main irrigated crops (crop budgets appended to this Annex). These patterns and&#13;
budgets were used to estimate the marginal returns to water shown in the right-hand&#13;
column of Table 7.10. Returns are higher in (b) than in (c) because the mix of crops is&#13;
more heavily weighted toward fruits and vegetables, and because distribution losses are&#13;
lower.&#13;
F. THE PROJECT&#13;
Water Deliveries and Allocations&#13;
53.   The combined economic benefits from the WWTP will ultimately depend on how&#13;
much water is diverted from Wanjiazhai to the Project Area, how much is left after&#13;
transmission losses, and how much is allocated to each sector. A variety of factors&#13;
determines how much water will be diverted: pipeline capacity, water allocations,&#13;
demand, and capacity of treating and distributing the Project water. The complete&#13;
WWTP has been allocated 1,200 million m3 of Yellow River water, a volume which&#13;
holds Shanxi province to the limits of consumption established by the SPC. Of this total,&#13;
640 million m3 has been allocated to the Taiyuan Project Area by Provincial Authorities,&#13;
with the remainder reserved for Phase II. Diversion works have been designed to handle&#13;
this volume. Diverted water must be treated for sediment and bacteria, and this will be&#13;
done at Huyon Treatment Plant to be constructed for that purpose. Huyon's capacity will&#13;
be designed to accommodate the expected volume of diversions, although  the&#13;
"lumpiness" of the works implies that there may be occasional bottlenecks in the early&#13;
years of construction and operation.&#13;
54.   Table 7.12 summarizes expected diversions, treatment, and distribution of Project&#13;
to the primary beneficiaries. Column (1) is demand net of local groundwater in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-182 -                                ANNEX7&#13;
medium case as described in Section (A). Column (2) is the volume of diversions at&#13;
Wanjiazhai required to meet that net demand, taking into account losses in distribution&#13;
and treatment, the 640 maximum diversion limit, and the scheduled capacity of Huyon&#13;
[column (3)]. Losses in distribution are estimated at 7 percent, and Huyon is expected to&#13;
lose 9 percent, mainly from evaporation from the sedimentation tanks. The 640 limit is&#13;
not reached until 2010. Huyon capacity will be a constraint on the system in 2002 and&#13;
2006 if the demand projections and other assumption hold, but only by small margins.&#13;
Column (4) gives the feasible inflow to Huyon, and column (5) the outflow after losses in&#13;
treatment. Columns (6) and (7) allocate treated water to industries, households, and&#13;
municipal demands in the same proportions as the projected demands. These are the&#13;
volumes upon which the primary benefits from the Project are obtained. Column (7) is&#13;
the total supply from local groundwater and Project water net of all losses, and column&#13;
(8) is the remaining water deficit, if any, again according to the medium demand&#13;
projections.&#13;

55.    The left part of Table 7.12 quantifies the underlying assumption.  The column&#13;
"Water Deficit" is the volumes needed to close the gap between demands and local&#13;
supplies. "Needed Diversions" is this volume inflated to allow for losses in transmission.&#13;
"Allowed Diversions" takes into account the future limits on allocation imposed by the&#13;
overall project and from the fact that eventually the water must be shared with Datong&#13;
and Pingshuo when Phase II is completed. We assume that 480 is the maximum allowed&#13;
diversion to Taiyuan up to 2010, and 640 by 2020 (by agreement, Taiyuan is to receive&#13;
53 percent of Wanjiazhai water). Note that by 2005, deliveries will already be less than&#13;
deficits, not taking into account additional supplies from treatment and reuse.&#13;

56.    The next columns allocate the deliveries to the consuming sectors urban life ("To&#13;
HH") and industry. This allocation does not reflect current policy, but is a means of&#13;
allocating benefits, which are disproportionately larger for industrial uses than for urban&#13;
consumption. The stated allocation assumes a division proportional to water demands in&#13;
the two sectors. The column "M&amp;I Ben's" is the total economic benefit in 1993 prices&#13;
based on the assumed allocations and the economic values derived in the previous&#13;
section.&#13;
Water Treatment Program&#13;
57.    At present, only 19 percent of wastewater in Taiyuan receives primary treatment.&#13;
The Project will ensure that this proportion eventually reaches 100 percent, and that the&#13;
treated water is recycled to industry and agriculture. Table 7.13 shows the planned&#13;
volumes by type of treatment. Part of the wastewater receiving secondary treatment may&#13;
be resold to industry for reuse. Plans for doing so have yet to be completed; therefore we&#13;
assume that all treated water will be made available to irrigation, first serving the&#13;
"suburban" areas, and then the downstream areas. The right part of Table 7.13 shows the&#13;
volumes which may be diverted to these irrigation uses, deriving the benefits described in&#13;
the previous sections.&#13;

Project Costs and Phasing&#13;
58.    The size and complexity of the WWTP have led local planners to prefer a phased&#13;
construction program, beginning with the General Main and South Main, followed by the&#13;
North Main at a later date. This schedule would permit the first water deliveries to&#13;
Taiyuan in the year 2000, and deliveries to Pingshuo and Datong about 2005.  The&#13;

components of the project which permit deliveries to Taiyuan are referred to as "Phase I",&#13;
and have total costs amounting to $1,412 million as described fully in Annex 2. The&#13;
timing and allocation of these costs are shown in Table 7.14 below.&#13;
59.    Estimates of Phase I project financial costs amount to  $1,150 million.  The&#13;
phasing and allocation of these costs are shown in Table 7.14 below.&#13;

60.    In addition, there are several types of variable economic costs associated with&#13;
diverting and supplying water, shown in the bottom part of Table 7.14. First, there are&#13;
operating costs which are applied to all water diverted and include power costs of&#13;
pumping, system management costs, and maintenance. Operating costs are estimated to&#13;
be Y 1.22/mr3 in 2002, declining to a long-range value of 1.04 due to economies of scale.&#13;
Second, Yellow River water will require desiltation and additional treatment at the Huyon&#13;
plant to be constructed as part of the project.  These treatment costs begin at Y 0.83/mr3&#13;
in 2002 and decline to Y 0.46/m3, and are applied to that part of water not lost in&#13;
transmission. The electricity component of the operating and treatment costs are shadow-&#13;
priced at Y 0.35/kWh. Finally, there are opportunity costs of Yellow River water which&#13;
reflect benefits forgone by downstream hydropower installations and irrigators. These&#13;
were estimated using the Yellow River Basin Model, and are Y 0.6/mr3 in 1996 prices.&#13;
G. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE PROJECT&#13;
61.    The economic performance of the Project is estimated with an economic cash&#13;
flow model based on the construction cost schedule given above, the benefits described in&#13;
section E, and the following assumptions about allocation policies:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-185 -                      ANNEX7&#13;
(a)   WWTP water will be directly supplied to households, municipal and&#13;
industrial demands only, in proportion to the demands of these sectors&#13;
(approximately 30 percent to H&amp;M, and 70 percent to industries).&#13;
(b)   Eighty percent of water supplies will be returned for treatment and reuse&#13;
by irrigators. Treatment by type will follow the schedule given above in&#13;
Section F, and the water first delivered to irrigation demands within the&#13;
project area (so-called truck gardens) up to the limit of estimated annual&#13;
demand of 108 million m3. The remainder of treated wastewater will be&#13;
released into the Fen River for use by downstream farmers.&#13;
62.   The basic cash flow model is shown in Table 7.15 up to the year 2020, after which&#13;
most of the entries are constant throughout the life of the project.&#13;
63.   Based on the assumptions contained in these cost and benefit streams, the&#13;
"medium" growth and demand projections, and a 50-year project life, the EIRR of the&#13;
project, including wastewater treatment and reuse, is estimated to be 22 percent. It's net&#13;
present value discounted at 12 percent (to 1996) is Y 10,221 million. Increased H&amp;M&#13;
consumption generates 7 percent of these benefits, industrial consumption, 83 percent,&#13;
and reuse in irrigation, 10 percent. These returns exclude any difficult-to-measure&#13;
environmental benefits from the elimination of groundwater mining, and from the&#13;
removal of health risks associated with inadequate urban water supply.&#13;
64.   When the costs of constructing and operating the treatment plants and water&#13;
retention ponds are removed, and the benefits from the use of the treated water in&#13;
irrigation are excluded, the rate of return is 20.4 percent (Table 7.16). This option is&#13;
clearly not preferable because treated wastewater benefits are distributed to a much wider&#13;
group of people, including the poorest farmers.&#13;
H. PROJECT RtSKS&#13;
65.   The major physical risks involve construction mishaps and delays, and seismic&#13;
events which could destroy the tunnels and connecting works. Construction risks are&#13;
deemed to be within manageable limits given close supervision by foreign and Chinese&#13;
experts. Nevertheless, a 1O percent cost increase has been included in the base case cash&#13;
flow model. The probability of an earthquake of a sufficient magnitude (7.0 Richter&#13;
scale) to damage the works is estimated to be less than 0.01 percent over the construction&#13;
period. As shown in Table 7.16, a 50 percent increase in construction costs (after 1996)&#13;
would still yield a rate of return of 17.4 percent, and a two-year delay in obtaining any&#13;
benefits would still produce a 17.3 percent return.&#13;

66.    The Project is also  robust with  respect to  the estimates of losses in  the&#13;
transmission system  and costs of operating it. Doubling the losses reduces the rate of&#13;
return from  22.0 to 20.7 percent, while doubling the operating costs reduces the rate of&#13;
return from 22.0 to 20.4 percent.&#13;
67.    Because the benefits from  increased water consumption by industries constitute&#13;
such a large proportion of total benefits, the estimates of these returns are critical to the&#13;
Project's performance. The analysis used a combination of input-output analysis and a&#13;
linear programming model to arrive at a more conservative value for industrial water than&#13;
more straightforward methods. The value was estimated to be about Y 31/in3 in 2002,&#13;
declining to a long-run value of 5.8-the eventual price of water charged to industries. If&#13;
these returns are reduced by 25 percent, the project still yields a rate of return of 17.5&#13;
percent.&#13;
68.    An additional concern is that future flows in the Yellow River may be insufficient&#13;
to the supply the Project's diversions. A simulation over the 56 years of available&#13;
hydrologic data showed that sufficient water will be available in all months and all years&#13;
if upstream diversions are held to currently agreed provincial allocation limits. However,&#13;
demands for Yellow River are insatiable, and failure to abide by the limits on the part of&#13;
provinces upstream from Wanjiazhai could jeopardize the project if flows are sharply&#13;
curtailed.&#13;
69.    The Project will ensure that all wastewater will be treated and most of it will be&#13;
made available to farmers. Without this component, the rate of return falls marginally to&#13;
20.6 percent, implying that this strategy is economically attractive, as well as providing&#13;
significant environmental and income distributional impacts.&#13;

H. IMPACTS ON BENEFICIARIES&#13;
70.   The Project's direct beneficiaries are urban households, and workers in factories&#13;
and mines.  Farmers will benefit indirectly.  Urban (household plus municipal)&#13;
consumption will increase from 90 million m3 (147 l/c/d) to 165 million m3 (225 l/c/d) in&#13;
2002, bringing it in line with Chinese norms. After 2010, when the Project Area again&#13;
begins to experience water shortages, per capita consumption will begin to decline&#13;
moderately, but still remain at acceptable levels throughout the Project's time horizon.&#13;
71.   The most dramatic impacts affect industrial workers.  Without the additional&#13;
water from the Project, employment and incomes in the area will almost certainly begin&#13;
to decline in the near future as population growth continues to demand more household&#13;
water (given precedence by policymakers), and local water supplies continue to diminish.&#13;
In Table 7.17, the "without" project projections assume a 3 percent annual growth in the&#13;
productivity of labor, and a 2 percent annual growth in real labor income. By 2002,&#13;
120,000 jobs will be lost to the water shortage, with the number increasing thereafter.&#13;
With the Project water, employment and income growth can continue. In 2002, this&#13;
means an increase of 98 percent in both employment and incomes over the without&#13;
Project scenario. By 2010, the differences become very large.&#13;

72.   In 1995, there were 41,930 farm households in the Project Area, holding 154,770&#13;
people with a per capita income of Y 1,443 ($175). These people will benefit in two&#13;
ways which are difficult to quantify. First, they will have full use of their local surface&#13;
and groundwater resources, part of which has been diverted to urban and industrial uses&#13;
in recent years. Second, those within the City who operate truck gardens will have first&#13;
call on the treated wastewater. The volumes they require are estimated to be 108 million&#13;
m3/year. Heretofore, they have had to rely on sporadic rainfall and untreated wastewater.&#13;
73.   Farm families in the counties downstream of Taiyuan will get the remainder of the&#13;
treated wastewater, projected to be 74 million m3 in 2002, rising to 326 million m3 after&#13;
2020. There about 66,700 farm households in the counties adjacent to the Fen, with a&#13;
population of 239,000. Their per capita income in 1995 was only Y 1,317 ($158). If we&#13;
assume that all of the increased production translates directly into increased income (the&#13;
primary effect of additional water is additional yield, requiring little more expenditure&#13;
than farm labor), then the Project will increase the incomes of these people by 23 percent&#13;
in 2002, 45 percent in 2005, and ultimately will almost double it.&#13;

ANNEX 8: ASSUMPTIONS TO FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
A. YRDPB&#13;
Pricing Methodology&#13;
1.     Water tariffs delivered by YRDPC to TMWC are projected by following steps:&#13;
a) obtaining annual capital requirements;&#13;
b) determining financing plans;&#13;
c) calculating total project cost by appropriate cost allocations (cost sharing);&#13;
d) forming necessary operational and financial assumptions;&#13;
e) setting up water tariffs based on a minimum  debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or a&#13;
minimum rate of return on fixed assets in service of 2 percent, whichever&#13;
gives a greater tariff, to make YRDPC financially sustainable and to provide&#13;
assurance of cost recovery and debt repayment.&#13;
2.     A summary table for above (a) to (c) is listed below.&#13;
Items                   Phase I (1993-2001)             Phase 11 (2002-2010)&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-193 -                     ANNEX8&#13;
Capital Requirements&#13;
3.    Although investment in Wanjiazhai Dam and phase II investments are not within&#13;
project scope, responsibility of timely investment in such constructions is at YRDPC.&#13;
Therefore, they have to be included in YRDPC's total capital requirements and also be&#13;
taken into account when determination of YRDPC's overall financing plan and financial&#13;
projections.&#13;
4.    Total capital requirements during phase I is estimated to be Y 13.55 billion prior&#13;
to interest during construction (IDC) (see Annex 8, Summary of Estimate Project Cost&#13;
and Financing Plan), or Y 14.07 billion if IDC is taken into account (estimated unrealized&#13;
foreign exchange loss of Y 165 million is a noncash capitalization item).&#13;
5.    Capital requirements by years for the proposed project are estimated by technical&#13;
group who based on planned project schedule as well as market price of labor and&#13;
materials. As explained above, capital requirement for phase I before IDC from financial&#13;
perspective is based on a different scope from  that of Costab summary.  The&#13;
environmental management and institutional component, Y 0.2 billion in total, are not&#13;
included in the cost estimate for YRDPC's financial forecasts as YRDPC may not be&#13;
responsible for implementation and future debt repayment for those components, while&#13;
YRDPC's capital requirements include investment in Wanjiazhai Dam of Y 2.23 billion&#13;
that is not covered by Costab summary. As a result, YRDPC's capital requirement before&#13;
IDC, Y 13.55 billion, is about Y 2 billion more than that on the Costab.&#13;
6.    Total capital requirements during phase II is estimated to be Y 10.8 billion (see&#13;
table attached on project costs and financing).&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
7.    To finance phase I capital requirements, YRDPC will need to obtain GSP&#13;
surcharges as well as to borrow.  Sources of funds are assumed to be used in the&#13;
following order and purposes:&#13;
(a)  The World Bank loan and the cofinancing loan will be used to support&#13;
foreign currency requirements within project scope;&#13;
(b)  Investment income from Wanjiazhai Dam can be used to finance the&#13;
proposed project;&#13;
(c)  GSP surcharges can be used to finance Wanjiazhai Dam and project scope&#13;
activities if shortage of funds still exist after use of previous two financing&#13;
sources; and&#13;
(d)  if shortage still exists, like during 1997-98, additional surcharges or&#13;
incremental water revenue as a result of water tariff adjustment will be&#13;
needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-194 -                     ANNEX8&#13;
8.    As YRDPC will be in operations during phase II and will have the capability in&#13;
self-financing partial phase II investments after debt repayment, financing plan for phase&#13;
II only consists of YRDPC's internal cash generation and GSP surcharges; no borrowing&#13;
is assumed.&#13;
Cost Sharing&#13;
9.    Because both phase I and phase II investments include both SMT and NMT&#13;
components, and because capital requirements and financing plan are determined at&#13;
YRDPC's overall perspective, cost sharing between SMT and NMT with regard to&#13;
several investment items is required in order to determine fixed assets cost, depreciation,&#13;
and water tariffs.&#13;
10.   GMT cost is a common cost for SMT and NMT and thus will be shared by&#13;
estimated eventual water volume delivered, 56.5 percent and 43.5 percent, respectively.&#13;
Investment in Wanjiazhai Dam is a long-term investment, thus will not subject to cost&#13;
sharing.&#13;
11.   Cost for SMT consists of shared GMT cost, cost to complete SMT, and cost of&#13;
connection works, which equals to 81.72 percent of total phase I investment cost&#13;
including capitalized interest and foreign exchange gain/loss. That is, only 81.72 percent&#13;
of total phase I cost will be considered in determination of water tariffs to TMWC&#13;
starting from year 2002; the remaining 18.28 percent of cost will belong to NMT and will&#13;
not subject to depreciate until completion of NMT.&#13;
12.   Similar treatment applies to phase II. Among phase II investments, 27.66 percent&#13;
and 72.34 percent will be allocated to SMT and NMT, respectively.&#13;
Assumptions to Financial Projections&#13;
13.   General Assumptions.    1995 actual financial status is used as base for&#13;
YRDPC's financial forecasts. 1996 price is used as a reference when projecting cost and&#13;
expenses. The following domestic and international inflation are currently adopted by the&#13;
Bank and used in making projections:&#13;
1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005&#13;
Domestic          6.2   5.8   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5&#13;
International     1.7   2.2   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5    2.5&#13;
Income Statement Parameters&#13;
14.   Water Diversion and Sales Volume: The project completion is estimated at the&#13;
end of year 2001 and thus year 2002 is estimated to be the first water diversion year.&#13;
Volume of diverted water from Wanjiazhai Dam and water deliveries to Huyan water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-195 -                       ANNEX8&#13;
treatment plant are both taken from economic analysis report. Water diversion and&#13;
deliveries will increase over years (see below) in line with the Huyan water treatment&#13;
plant's capacity expansion.&#13;
2002 2004 2006 2008 2010&#13;
Diverted water at Wanjiazhai Dam (million m3)   293   382   451   551   640&#13;
Delivered water at Huyan treatment plant      273   356   420   514   596&#13;
15.   Water Tariffs: Tariffs are driven by the minimum debt service coverage ratio of&#13;
1.2 (2003-2016) and a minimum ROA of 2 percent (from 2011 onward) as set out in&#13;
Loan Agreement.&#13;
16.   Other Operating Revenue: It is assumed that 72 percent of Taiyuan water sales&#13;
volume can be recycled, treated, and reused. Tariff for recycled water is estimated at&#13;
Y 0.2/m3. It is assumed that YRDPC will get 50 percent of proceeds from sales of reused&#13;
water as its other operating revenue.&#13;
17.   Operating Costs: Operating costs consist of personnel, power cost, repair and&#13;
maintenance cost, water resource fee, depreciation, and other expense.&#13;
18.   Annual salary is estimated to be Y 8,000 per person in year 2002. Additional 14&#13;
percent of base salary is estimated to be fringe benefit. Total number of employees for&#13;
YRDPC is assumed to be 1312. Such personnel cost will then escalate by local inflation&#13;
rates each year.&#13;
19.   Power consumption rate is assumed to be at 2.38 kWh per m3 diverted water over&#13;
the project implementation period for the South Main. Power cost is based on 1996 price&#13;
of 32 fen/kWh and will escalate by local inflation rates.&#13;
20.   Repair and maintenance cost is assumed to be at 1.65 percent of the total fixed&#13;
assets cost (historical cost), which consists of 1.5 percent for maintenance/labor and 0.15&#13;
percent for materials, and will escalate with the local inflation rates. Water resource fee&#13;
will be levied at 2.7 fen per m3 water diverted. Other expenses is assumed to be 0.35&#13;
percent of the total fixed assets cost and will escalate with the local inflation rates.&#13;
21.   Straight-line method is used in deriving depreciation. Depreciation is provided at&#13;
2.3 percent of the fixed asset cost annually.&#13;
22.   Other Tax and Fees: YRDPC does not need to pay value-added-tax (VAT),&#13;
which is generally levied at 6 percent of revenue net of VAT for water supplying entities,&#13;
but it is still obliged to pay other tax and fees on top of imputed VAT. Urban&#13;
construction and maintenance tax is levied at 7 percent of imputed VAT, educational fees&#13;
3 percent, and surcharge for price adjustment fund 2 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-196 -                     ANNEX8&#13;
23.   Investment Income:  Investment income is to capture YRDPC's share in&#13;
Wanjiazhai Dam's net income, which will mainly come from electricity sales revenue.&#13;
24.   Interest and Foreign Exchange Gain/Loss: Interest during construction and&#13;
foreign exchange gain/loss will be capitalized into project cost. After project completion,&#13;
interest and foreign exchange gain/loss will be recognized as current expense. Interest on&#13;
foreign loans during construction period is assumed to be financed locally and paid off in&#13;
the current year.&#13;
25.   Income tax is assumed to be 33 percent of income before income tax.&#13;
26.   Appropriation of Net Income: Net income is assumed to be appropriated in the&#13;
following order: (1) welfare fund and development fund, which account for 15 percent of&#13;
net income; (2) dividends, if any; (3) increase in retained earnings.&#13;
Balance Sheet Parameters&#13;
27.   Cash: During SMT construction period, no annual cash increase is assumed, i.e.,&#13;
annual fund resource is assumed just enough to cover annual capital expenditures.&#13;
Starting from SMT operation in 2002, however, YRDPC will have cash surplus after&#13;
repayment of debt due to compliance of minimum financial covenants. Such cash surplus&#13;
plus additional surcharges from provincial government are assumed to be used in north&#13;
main construction.&#13;
28.   Accounts receivable is assumed to be 4.16 percent of current year revenue, or a&#13;
turnover rate of 24 per year.&#13;
29.   Inventory is assumed to cover adequate materials for 3-month maintenance.&#13;
30.   Prepayment of construction cost was Y 211.731 million at end of 1995. That&#13;
stands for payment for the project but not yet qualified for recognition of a WIP. It is&#13;
assumed that by end of each year, similar situation would occur and thus the same&#13;
amount remains until the proposed project is complete when WIP is transferred to fixed&#13;
assets. Therefore, in year 2002, fixed assets increase includes both transfers from&#13;
cumulative WIP as well as from the balance of prepayment.&#13;
31.   Long-term  investment is assumed to capture YRDPC's investment in&#13;
Wanjiazhai Dam and Fen Reservoir 2. As equity method will be adopted to recognize&#13;
YRDPC's investment income, power revenue from Wanjiazhai Dam has been estimated&#13;
under Investment Income projections. Because such long-term investments are also&#13;
financed by GSP surcharges, capital requirement for them is taken into account in&#13;
determination of YRDPC's overall financing plan.&#13;
32.   Fixed asset cost is cumulated and transferred from work-in-progress cost, which&#13;
includes capital investment cost, interest during construction, commitment fees, and&#13;
foreign exchange gain/loss. Fixed assets will not be revalued every year. But notional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-197 -                      ANNEX8&#13;
revalued fixed asset value have been calculated in order to set up tariffs under the rate of&#13;
return scenario.&#13;
33.   It is assumed that phase I of the project will be completed by end of year 2001,&#13;
and project phase II will start from year 2002 and finish at end of 2009. Since YRDPC is&#13;
accountable for construction, operations, and management of both project phases,&#13;
YRDPC's financial forecasts are prepared not only to include phase I but phase II's all&#13;
relevant financial assumptions including cost estimate and financing plans. Cost of&#13;
general main will be allocated to south and north main proportionally according to&#13;
planned water supply volume. Based on different project costs and financing plans,&#13;
tariffs for YRDP water supplied to Taiyuan and Datong (and Pingshao) can be&#13;
determined.&#13;
34.   Accounts payable is assumed to be one-month of cash operating costs.&#13;
35.   Tax payable include one-month tax and fees to be paid, plus current year's&#13;
income tax amount.&#13;
36.   Other payable is assumed to include 5 percent of accounts payable, interest on&#13;
local borrowing, and declared dividends, if any.&#13;
37.   Long-term debt: The forecast long-term debt includes the World Bank loan and&#13;
the Italian loan. The World Bank loan of $400 million is assumed to finance most&#13;
foreign currency component of the project cost. Terms for the World Bank loan are 20&#13;
years including a 5-year grace. Interest rate and commitment fee for the Bank loan are&#13;
assumed to be 6.13 percent and 0.25 percent, respectively. In addition, cofinancing loan&#13;
of $30 million will be used. Terms for Italian loan are 25 years including a 5-year grace;&#13;
interest rate is assumed at 6 percent annually. Debt repayment will start from year 2002;&#13;
therefore, beginning from year 2001, "current maturity of long-term loan" is shown on&#13;
the balance sheet and reclassified as a current liability.&#13;
38.   No local borrowings is assumed under the assumption that any shortage of funds,&#13;
after (1) World Bank loan, (2) cofinancing loan, (3) power revenue from Wanjiazhai Dam&#13;
(investment income since 1999), and (4) cumulatively available GSP surcharges, will be&#13;
resolved by additional governmental support (marked as additional surcharges under the&#13;
cash flow statement).&#13;
39.   Capital surplus refers to the cumulated surcharges on coal, electricity and water&#13;
appropriated from government. It is assumed that surcharges will be used to finance&#13;
phase I investments before 2002 and to support phase II afterwards. It is also assumed&#13;
that collection and use of surcharges cannot exceed a particular year's capital&#13;
requirements. GSP surcharges are not to be used in debt repayment.&#13;
40.   Earned surplus refers to cumulated employee welfare fund and development&#13;
fund which allocated from each year's net income per legal requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-198 -                         ANNEX8&#13;
41.   Retained earnings are undesignated cumulated profits from operations which can&#13;
be used in debt repayment, future capital investments, rehabilitation work, or even&#13;
dividend to shareholders, if any.&#13;
Funds Flow Statement&#13;
42.   Debt service coverage ratio is computed according to the following formula:&#13;
(Net Income After Taxes + Interest on Long-Term Debt + Depreciation) / (Principal Repayment + Interest Expense)&#13;
43.   Rate of return on notionally revalued fixed assets is calculated using the&#13;
following formula:&#13;
(Net Operating Income) / (Average of Beginning and Ending Balances of Notionally Revalued Fixed Assets&#13;
in Service)&#13;
44.   GSP Surcharges&#13;
(a)    Coal /a&#13;
Current levies on coal sales by provincial finance bureau to fund&#13;
Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project are as below:&#13;
crude coal:   Y 2 per ton sold /b&#13;
washed coal: Y 3 per ton sold&#13;
charcoal:     Y 4 per ton sold&#13;
Additional surcharge of Y 0.5 per ton coal sales has been approved and&#13;
was effective from year 1996.&#13;
/a Duplicate levies are avoided, i.e., only one kind of surcharge is levied in&#13;
the coal processing cycle. Provincial Finance Bureau is conceiving to&#13;
impose duplicate levies and has submitted a proposal for government&#13;
approval. It is estimated that roughly additional Y 70 million can be&#13;
collected each year if this policy becomes effective, but this is not&#13;
included in the current financial forecasts.&#13;
/b VAT of 13 percent and other surcharges like educational fees are&#13;
included.   VAT  and fees will not be used to  finance  YRDP&#13;
construction, so available GSP surcharge from coal sales will be lesser&#13;
than Y 2 per ton.&#13;
(b)    Electricity:    Electricity  consumption  by  domestic  and  irrigation&#13;
consumption is imposed at 0.57 fen/kWh as YRDP funds. Electricity&#13;
consumption in other sectors within Shanxi province is imposed at 1.5 fen/&#13;
kWh. VAT and other fees are included, so effective rates are 0.4787 fen/&#13;
kWh and 1.26 fen/kWh respectively.&#13;
&#13;

-199 -                     ANNEX8&#13;
Levy on outbound electricity sales has been proposed by Shanxi provincial&#13;
government and is very likely to materialize.  In current financial&#13;
projections, it is assumed that surcharge of 1.5 fen/kWh will be imposed&#13;
on outbound electricity sales starting from year 1998.&#13;
(c)   Water: The following are surcharge rates for water consumption in 1994&#13;
in different cities.&#13;
Y 0.25 (per ton of water consumption) in Taiyuan City&#13;
Y 0.2 in Datong&#13;
Y 0.1 in Yangguan&#13;
Y 0.05 in Changzhi&#13;
45.   Collection channels.  Surcharges on coal are collected by coal mines, coal&#13;
transport stations, and highway polling stations. Local or County Tax Bureaus are&#13;
responsible for turning over these surcharges to provincial finance bureau. Electricity&#13;
surcharge is collected by provincial power bureau who then submits collections to&#13;
provincial finance bureau. Water consumption surcharge is collected by municipal water&#13;
supply companies. Municipal finance departments are responsible for turning over this&#13;
surcharge to provincial finance bureau.&#13;
46.   Past and Future Collections. GSP surcharges are deposited in a special account.&#13;
Up to end of 1995, cumulative collection amounted to Y 2 billion; in which Y 1.6 billion&#13;
or so has been appropriated to YRDPC for project use. YRDPC and provincial finance&#13;
bureau have jointly estimated that surcharge collection will increase from Y 1 billion in&#13;
1996 (including additional surcharge of Y 0.5 on coal) to Y 1.2 billion in year 2001,&#13;
based on an assumed collection rate of 96.8 percent.&#13;
47.   Surcharge Assumptions in Financial Forecasts.  In YRDPC's financial&#13;
forecasts, it is assumed that GSP surcharges will be used to finance the proposed project&#13;
before end of 2001 and then the project phase II between 2002 and 2009. It is also&#13;
assumed that the World Bank loans, cofinancing loan, and investment income from&#13;
Wanjiazhai Dam, if available, are to be used prior to use of GSP surcharges. Therefore,&#13;
any excess of available funding in a particular year over that year's capital needs will be&#13;
considered to be GSP surcharges and be deferred to the following years. GSP surcharges&#13;
are not assumed to be used in debt repayment as the debt repayment factor has been taken&#13;
into account when determining market-driven water tariffs. Although GSP surcharges&#13;
may continue to be collected after the project completion, alleged by leaders of Shanxi&#13;
province, no income or capital increase in this regard has been assumed in YRDPC's&#13;
financial forecasts after 2010. In other words, no capital requirement, no GSP surcharge&#13;
allocation to YRDPC despite its availability.&#13;
Reporting Basis and Accounting Standards&#13;
48.   As an entity in charge of YRDP construction work, YRDPC currently adopts the&#13;
Accounting Standards for Construction Entities to prepare balance sheet and some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 200 -                    ANNEX 8&#13;
supplementary statements. After project completion, YRDPC is to manage day-to-day&#13;
operations and will follow Accounting Standards for Operating Entities to prepare not&#13;
only balance sheets but also income statements and funds flow statements. At present,&#13;
YRDPC's financial reports are prepared in different combination scopes.&#13;
49.   The first kind of balance sheet and supplementary information presents YRDPC's&#13;
receipts of GSP surcharges provincial finance bureau and applications of such funds on&#13;
the project and Wanjiazhai dam.&#13;
50.   The second kind is a combined balance sheet for the project from ten independent&#13;
accounting units' balance sheets, excluding financial information for Wanjiazhai dam.&#13;
Ten accounting entities are headquarters construction division, headquarters institutional&#13;
division, Pianquan division, Pinglu division, Shanyang division, Ningwu division, post&#13;
administrative station, Taiyuan division, power supply division, and communication&#13;
division.&#13;
51.   The third kind of balance sheet is prepared by Wanjiazhai Project Bureau for the&#13;
dam component. As the dam is jointly invested by MWR, YRDPC, and Inner Mongolia,&#13;
the forth kind of balance sheet is prepared in a way to present only YRDPB's&#13;
investments.&#13;
52.   Then, for project monitoring, YRDP headquarters combines the forth and the&#13;
second kinds of balance sheet to produce the fifth kind of combined financial statement&#13;
which gives an overall project investment picture.&#13;
53.  In sum, to obtain a comprehensive financial report for YRDPC as a whole, the&#13;
fifth kind of reports should be consolidated with the first kind of report as the latter&#13;
includes the Bureau's available cash yet to be appropriated to the subordinate entities.&#13;
Unfortunately, no such a report has been prepared at present despite existence of various&#13;
individual and combined reports. Thus, YRDPC's balance sheet for the past four years&#13;
(1992-95) presented in Annex 8 is prepared following the above-mentioned principle.&#13;
B. TMWC&#13;
Pricing Methodology&#13;
54.   Water tariffs supplied by TMWC to end users are projected by following steps&#13;
similar to those described above for YRDPC:&#13;
(a) obtaining annual capital requirements;&#13;
(b) determining financing plans;&#13;
(c) calculating total project cost;&#13;
d) obtaining and validating necessary operational and financial assumptions for&#13;
both groundwater supply and purchased water treatment and supply;&#13;
e) setting up water tariffs based on a minimum debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or a&#13;
minimum rate of return on fixed assets in service of 2 percent, whichever&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 201-                     ANNEX8&#13;
gives a greater tariff, to make TMWC financially sustainable and provide&#13;
assurance of cost recovery and debt repayment.&#13;
55.   A summary table for above (a) to (c) is listed below.&#13;
Phase 1 (1997-2000)            Phase 11 (2005-2010)&#13;
TMWC          Huyan water treatment plant Phase I Huyan phase 11 (1.76 million mi3&#13;
(1 million m3/day), municipal distri- day) (unit 5 and 6 during 2005-07&#13;
bution/transmission pipelines  and unit 7 during 2008-10)&#13;
Capital Needs  Y 2.549 billion (estimate provided by Y1.941 billion (estimate based on&#13;
TMWC)                          phase I cost, inflation factor&#13;
considered)&#13;
Financing Plan Funding from Provincial and Munici- TMWC internal cash generation,&#13;
pal government, TMWC internal    Provincial surcharges on coal and&#13;
cash generation, incremental water  electricity sales&#13;
revenue from water tariff adjust-&#13;
ments, Japanese OECF loans&#13;
56.   To finance the Huyan water treatment plant and transmission/distribution&#13;
pipelines, Taiyuan municipality expected that a total of Y 900 million would be financed&#13;
by allocated funds from provincial and municipal governments, and the remaining capital&#13;
needs would be met by borrowing Japanese OECF loans. However, only Y 466 million&#13;
during the construction period is considered likely to materialize, which includes&#13;
(1) capital investment project funds from the municipal planning commission for Y 16&#13;
million per year, (2) the urban construction and maintenance tax from the urban&#13;
construction commission for Y 24 million per year, (3) the local surcharge on water&#13;
consumption for Y 11 million per year, (4) the water resource charge of Y 8 million per&#13;
year, and (5) allocated funds from the provincial government for Y 230 million in four&#13;
years. The shortage of Y 434, thus, is assumed to be funded by TMWC's internal cash&#13;
generation (its cumulated retained earnings), and additional water revenues as a result of&#13;
water tariff adjustments. The Japanese OECF loan is assumed to have a term of 22 years&#13;
including a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate of 4.35 percent.&#13;
Assumptions to Financial Projections&#13;
General Assumptions&#13;
57.   1995 actual financial statements are used as base for TMWC's financial forecasts.&#13;
1996 price is used as a reference when projecting cost and expenses. The following&#13;
domestic and international inflation are currently adopted by the Bank and used in&#13;
making projections:&#13;
1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 202 -                    ANNEX 8&#13;
Income Statement Parameters&#13;
58.   Water purchase and sales volume:   Given current overextraction  of&#13;
groundwater, TMWC will reduce water supply volume each year, from 154 million ton&#13;
per year in year 1995 to estimated 117 million ton in year 2001. Since year 2002 when it&#13;
starts to purchase diverted water from YRDPC, TMWC will continue to reduce the&#13;
groundwater extraction slightly but supply more purchased water each year.  It is&#13;
assumed that water usage rate at Huyan treatment plant is 9.1 percent, and that&#13;
transmission and distribution loss is 6.34 percent for groundwater and 8 percent for raw&#13;
water.&#13;
59.   With respect to capacity expansion in order for Huyan water treatment plant to&#13;
receive increasing diverted water volume, it is assumed that phase II investment for&#13;
additional three units to increase capacity from 1 million m3/day to 1.76 million m3/day&#13;
will be made during 2005 and 2010.&#13;
60.   The following shows water volume of TMWC's groundwater extraction, diverted&#13;
water purchase, and supply to end users in several selected years:&#13;
2002  2004  2006  2008  2010&#13;
Groundwater supply                   117   114   113   112   111&#13;
Delivered water purchase at Huyan    273   356   420   514   596&#13;
Water Sales                          337   405   457   535   603&#13;
61.   Water Tariffs: Tariffs are driven by a minimum debt service ratio of 1.2 and a&#13;
minimum ROA of 2 percent as set out in financial covenants.&#13;
62.   Tax and fees: TMWC will need to pay value-added-tax (VAT) at 6 percent of&#13;
revenue net of VAT, and other tax and fees on top of VAT. Urban construction and&#13;
maintenance tax is levied at 7 percent of paid VAT, educational fees 3 percent, and&#13;
surcharge for price adjustment fund 2 percent. VAT will be collected by TMWC on&#13;
behalf of government and will not be shown on the forecast income statement. Projected&#13;
water tariffs on the income statement are net of VAT.&#13;
63.   Operating Costs: Operating costs consist of water purchase cost, personnel,&#13;
chemicals, power cost, repair and maintenance cost, depreciation, and other expense.&#13;
64.   For groundwater sales, operating costs are assumed to base on 1995 actual and to&#13;
escalate by 10 percent to 22 percent annually, and further fluctuate by estimated water&#13;
extraction volume.&#13;
65.   For treated raw water sales, operating costs are assumed as follows.&#13;
Unit water purchase cost is based on projected YRDPC's water tariffs.&#13;
Since year 2002, additional personnel cost of Y 7.3 million is assumed to incur&#13;
due to Huyan treatment plant's operations, new distribution pipelines, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 203 -                      ANNEX8&#13;
associated maintenance needed. Such personnel cost will escalate with local&#13;
inflation rates.&#13;
Chemical cost for diverted water is estimated at Y 70.3 per 1,000 m3 water&#13;
production and will escalate by inflation rates.&#13;
Power cost for diverted water sales is derived from a power consumption rate of&#13;
0.14 kWh/1,000 m3 water production and the market power tariff of 32 fen/kWh&#13;
in 1996 and will escalate with the local inflation rates.&#13;
Repair and maintenance cost for the new capital investments is assumed to be 2.9&#13;
percent of the new fixed assets cost (Huyan water treatment plant and distribution&#13;
pipelines).&#13;
Straight-line method is used in deriving depreciation. Annual depreciation is&#13;
provided at 7 percent of existing fixed asset plus 4.5 percent of new assets.&#13;
Other expenses is estimated to be 10 percent of above-mentioned estimated&#13;
expenses exclusive of depreciation.&#13;
66.   Interest: Interest during construction will be capitalized into project cost. After&#13;
project completion, interest will be recognized as current expense. Interest on foreign&#13;
loans will be financed locally and paid off in the current year.&#13;
67.   Income tax is assumed to be 33 percent of income before income tax.&#13;
68.   Appropriation of net income: Net income is assumed to be appropriated as&#13;
follows: (1) submission of GSP fund to municipal finance department which will turn it&#13;
to the provincial finance department for YRDP project use (GSP fund from water sector&#13;
will cease at end of year 1998), (2) welfare fund and development fund per legal&#13;
requirements, which account for 15 percent of net income; (3) dividends, if any; (4)&#13;
increase in retained earmings.&#13;
Balance Sheet Parameters&#13;
69.   Cash: During Huyan phase I construction period (1997-2000), no significant&#13;
cash increase is anticipated. Starting from year 2001, cash appears to cumulate because&#13;
(1) capital expenditure and transmission/distribution expansion programs are not fully&#13;
reflected in the projections, (2) TMWC has to meet minimum financial requirement such&#13;
as debt service ratio of 1.2 since 2002, and (3) TMWC needs to build up its capability to&#13;
partially self-finance the Huyan phase II investment.&#13;
70.   Accounts receivable is assumed to be 4.17 percent of current year revenue, or a&#13;
turnover rate of 24 per year.&#13;
71.   Inventory is assumed to be maintained at one month's chemical cost plus two&#13;
months' repair and maintenance cost.&#13;
72.   Long-term investment is assumed to maintain unchanged since 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 204 -                      ANNEX 8&#13;
73.   Fixed asset cost is cumulated and transferred from work-in-progress cost, which&#13;
includes capital investment cost, interest during construction, and foreign exchange&#13;
gain/loss. Fixed assets will not be revalued every year. But notional revalued fixed asset&#13;
value have been calculated in order to set up tariffs under the rate-of-return-on-assets&#13;
(ROA) scenario.&#13;
74.   Accounts payable is assumed to be one-month's cash operating costs.&#13;
75.   Tax payable include one-month VAT and tax and fees to be paid, plus current&#13;
year's income tax amount.&#13;
76.   Other payable is assumed to decrease each year by 5 percent since 1995.&#13;
77.   Long-term loans are assumed according to TMWC's plan to borrow Japanese&#13;
OECF loan of around Y 1.85 billion to fulfill capital requirements for Huyan water&#13;
treatment plant phase I investment and municipal water distribution system. The length&#13;
of OECF loan is assumed to be 22 years including a 5-year grace. Annual interest rate is&#13;
assumed to be 4.35 percent. No local borrowing is assumed because capital requirements&#13;
exceeding OECF loan amount will be funded by (1) TMWC's internal cash generation,&#13;
(2) budget allocation from both provincial and municipal governments, and (3)&#13;
incremental water revenue as a result of the proposed water tariff adjustment.&#13;
78.   Capital represents actual funds allocated from government as of end of 1995. As&#13;
no share capital is anticipated in short term, this balance is assumed to be unchanged for&#13;
the forecast period. Any government fund allocation will then treated as an increase in&#13;
capital surplus (like a donation) under generally accepted accounting principles.&#13;
79.   Capital surplus increases upon (1) receipt of allocated budget from provincial&#13;
and municipal governments to finance Huyan water treatment plant's phase I&#13;
construction, and (2) receipt of connection charge paid by new applicants.&#13;
80.   Earned surplus refers to cumulated employee welfare fund and development&#13;
fund which allocated from each year's net income per legal requirements.&#13;
81.   Retained earnings are undesignated cumulated profits from operations which can&#13;
be used in debt repayment, future capital investments, rehabilitation work, or even&#13;
dividend to shareholders, if any.&#13;
82.   Debt service coverage ratio is computed as follows.&#13;
(Net Income After Tax + Interest on Long-Term Debt + Depreciation) / (Principal Repayment + Interest Expense)&#13;
83.   Rate of return on notionally revalued fixed assets is calculated as follows.&#13;
(Net Operating Income) / (Average of Beginning and Ending Balances of Notionally Revalued Fixed Assets&#13;
in Service)&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 11: WATER SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORM&#13;
1.    The Yellow River Diversion Project (YRDP) has significant effect on the economic&#13;
development of the Shanxi Province. When completed, the water shortage will be&#13;
significantly reduced. In order to ensure the rational development and utilization of the&#13;
water resources within the area and to fully exploit the project benefits, it is necessary to&#13;
reform the existing water institutions in the Yellow River water supply area.&#13;
Guidelines of Establishing New System&#13;
2.    The guidelines for establishing a new system in the Yellow River water supply area&#13;
will follow the principles:&#13;
(a)   Water resource allocation will be based on economic needs.&#13;
(b)   Water pricing system will be reformed for industry, agriculture and domestic&#13;
use.&#13;
3.    The center of the management reform is to free the water resource operations units&#13;
from government control and to transform them into independent corporations. These&#13;
corporations would carry out their own accounting and assume responsibilities for losses&#13;
and profits and finance development from loans they borrow.&#13;
4.    The reform will integrate operation of water resource management at all levels. The&#13;
main water resource institutions to be corporatized are: YRDP; Fen-1 Reservoir Co. Ltd.;&#13;
Fen-2 Reservoir Co. Ltd.; and Taiyuan Municipal Water Company, who will be responsible&#13;
for supplying water to users.&#13;
5.    Irrigation districts at county, township and village levels would be corporatized.&#13;
Main irrigation systems that are presently owned by Government will be sold to the private&#13;
sector through auctions. Farmers will be encouraged to buy shares to raise funds. Farmers'&#13;
representatives will be on the water company board. Farmers will be involved in decision-&#13;
making and managing the water supply corporations. The water units will be allowed to&#13;
sell their water saved through water conservation measures to industrial and domestic users.&#13;
Proposed Reform in the Yellow River Water Supply Area&#13;
6.    The reform is planned to be carried out in two steps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 229 -                     ANNEX 11&#13;
(a)   Changing the Present Governmental Water Supply Organizations into&#13;
Companies&#13;
(i)   The YRDP Management Office will be reorganized and transformed&#13;
into the Yellow River Water Enterprise Company Ltd.  The&#13;
corporation will use the water resource compensation fee of the&#13;
provincial government as state shares.&#13;
(ii)    The Fen River I Reservoir Management Bureau will be reorganized&#13;
to form the Fen River 1 Reservoir Co. Ltd. The company will use its&#13;
assets as collateral to borrow funds for rehabilitation and extension&#13;
of the Fen River 1 Reservoir after the YRDP water is diverted into&#13;
the reservoir. The main functions of the company are to regulate&#13;
Yellow River water and to sell this water to downstream industrial&#13;
and mining enterprises, to Fen-2 Reservoir, and to Taiyuan&#13;
Municipal Water Company. The company will also have revenues&#13;
from power generation, tourism, etc.&#13;
(iii)   Fen-2 Reservoir Water Enterprise Company Ltd. will be a new&#13;
company set up after completion of the construction of the Fen-2&#13;
dam. The main functions of this company are to regulate local water&#13;
from Fen-1 Reservoir, the local runoff between the Fen-1 and the&#13;
Fen-2 dams, and to sell water to the Fen River Irrigation District, and&#13;
industrial and mining enterprises, in emergency periods and special&#13;
years. The water from this reservoir will be used as reserve water.&#13;
The company also has the functions of power generation and&#13;
tourism.&#13;
(iv)    The present Fen River Water Conservancy Management Bureau will&#13;
be reformed into Fen River Water Enterprise Corporation. Its main&#13;
functions are to sell water to farmers' managed irrigation districts,&#13;
industrial and mining enterprises, as well as township enterprises.&#13;
The company also has the functions of flood plain development and&#13;
real estate development.&#13;
(v)    Taiyuan Municipal Water Company will be reformed into Taiyuan&#13;
Municipal Water Supply Company Ltd. When the company is set&#13;
up, the investments from the Taiyuan Municipal Government and&#13;
the Shanxi Provincial Government, together with its original&#13;
properties will be sold as shares to the public. In addition, water&#13;
resources development foundation will be set up to extensively&#13;
absorb the scattered funds from the individuals and the society to&#13;
accumulate funds as shares. The main functions of this company are&#13;
to supply water to Taiyuan's industrial and mining enterprises and&#13;
productive management units and domestic water users.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 230 -                     ANNEX 11&#13;
(vi)    The existing Taiyuan Sewage Treatment Plant will be converted into&#13;
Taiyuan Sewage Treatment Company Ltd. The main functions are&#13;
to treat the domestic sewage water and wastewater discharged by&#13;
industrial and mining enterprises and reuse the treated water for&#13;
agricultural and industrial uses and to meet a part of water demand&#13;
for municipal uses.&#13;
Each company will set up a shareholder's congress, board of directors,&#13;
supervision commissions. Each company will have its own administrative&#13;
offices, public relation department, financial department and others will be&#13;
set up.&#13;
These companies will be established according to the "Company Law of&#13;
China" and the relevant regulations, and the company will assume their&#13;
losses and profits.&#13;
The Self-Supply Tubewell Commission (SSTC) will be set up and have an&#13;
operation center responsible for the management, coordination, supervision&#13;
and control of the business operation of the scattered tubewells. SSTC will&#13;
control overdraft of groundwater and will establish clear guidelines of&#13;
groundwater extraction.&#13;
A water management conmmission will be established as a water regulator in&#13;
the supply area, which will consist of representatives of relevant&#13;
governmental departments and legal representatives of corporations. The&#13;
main functions are as follows:&#13;
(i)    To coordinate the allocation of water to industrial, domestic and&#13;
agricultural users of different corporations based on the inflow&#13;
conditions and water demands in different years to achieve optimal&#13;
water distribution;&#13;
(ii)    To coordinate the transaction costs and water charges of different&#13;
water supply companies;&#13;
(iii)    To organize trading of water among corporations and to promote&#13;
greater reuse of water.&#13;
The Water Commission will set up the executive office and will have the&#13;
regulatory functions for water resource planning, water allocation, water&#13;
price adjustment and monitoring of surface and groundwater resources.&#13;
(b)   Establishing a Group Corporation System. The second stage of the&#13;
reform will be the setting up of a group water corporation of all the suppliers&#13;
of water (YRDP, Fen-1, Fen-2, Fen Irrigation Bureaus, and SSTC). This&#13;
corporation is essentially a river basin authority whose main functions are to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 231-                     ANNEX 11&#13;
manage the water resources within the Upper Fen Basin. The authority will&#13;
be responsible for both surface and groundwater.&#13;
7.    The autonomy and other legal rights of companies will be protected by the&#13;
Company Law of China and its accompanying regulations. The companies are subject to&#13;
jurisdiction of Water Law of China and its accompanying regulations.&#13;
8.    The water corporations will be required to compile and implement water supply&#13;
plans in accordance with the approved comprehensive water resources development plans.&#13;
The water supply plan should take into consideration of the following: (a) flood control and&#13;
river protection requirements; (b) allocation of water to industrial, municipal and irrigation&#13;
uses and environmental needs; and (c) water extraction should be no more than the quotas&#13;
specified in their water permits.&#13;
9.    Sanctions should be imposed to those, who destroy water conservancy projects and&#13;
damage of water resource facilities by the legal departments of the governments.&#13;
10.   To protect the groundwater resources, the groundwater extraction fee will be raised&#13;
to comparable levels as surface water.&#13;
11.   Government permission will be required to shift irrigation water to industrial and&#13;
domestic users. Extra fees are to be collected from those users to compensate the farmers in&#13;
monetary forms. The rational trading of water between domestic and industrial users will&#13;
be approved by the Government.&#13;
12.  In the operation of companies, the Government will continue to support and help the&#13;
companies to resolve issues between different water units.&#13;
Procedures of Implementation&#13;
13.   The institutional reform of water management system will be implemented in three&#13;
stages:&#13;
(a)   By the year 2000, the grassroots water supply units at county, township and&#13;
village levels in Yellow River water supply area will be reformed to be&#13;
companies;&#13;
(b)   Before the year 2001, the water supply units in Taiyuan urban area will be&#13;
autonomous under a river basin corporation (Upper Fen Basin Corporation);&#13;
(c)   By the time the North Main is brought into operation, all the water supply&#13;
units will be turned into companies.&#13;
14.   The first-stage reform commenced in October 1996 and the following will be&#13;
implemented starting 1997:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 232 -                     ANNEX 11&#13;

leadership of the provincial government, concerned planning report will be&#13;
submitted to the World Bank.&#13;
(b)   In March 1998, the pilot water supply corporations will be established at the&#13;
county, township and village levels.&#13;
(c)   In August 1998, a research report on water pricing system will be submitted&#13;
a new policy of water pricing will be issued.&#13;
(d)   By 1998, a report of the research program for the corporatization of the&#13;
water supply units will be completed and the execution of the reform will be&#13;
commenced.&#13;
(e)   By 2000, the study of optimal dispatching of various water resources&#13;
considering Yellow River diverted by YRDP through simulation will be&#13;
completed. The water supply units at county, township and village levels&#13;
will be brought into corporation frame.&#13;
15.   The second-stage reform will be:&#13;
(a)   In 2001, the water supply at county, township and village levels will be&#13;
brought within the river basin corporation.  The corporation will be&#13;
publicized one year before the corporation is formed.&#13;
(b)   In 2001, a water resource monitoring system will be established.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 12: PROPOSED MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
1.    The effectiveness of project implementation in terms of alleviating water supply&#13;
bottlenecks of Taiyuan City will be measured by reference to a number of monitoring&#13;
indicators. The specific project objectives and the associated monitoring indicators are&#13;
listed in Table 1. Each indicator requires a baseline level against which the effectiveness&#13;
of the project in achieving the design objectives can be measured. Shanxi Government&#13;
and YRDPC obtained the necessary baseline data (as of July 1996) and developed the&#13;
necessary methodologies for monitoring.&#13;
2.    The achievement of project output will be monitored by CPM/PERT charts&#13;
showing the detailed completion of each task (see Annex 10).&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 15: ADMINISTRATION OF THE POLLUTION&#13;
SUBLOANS&#13;
Purpose of the Subloans&#13;
1.    WWTP/Phase I Components. The WWTP/Phase I comprises two types of&#13;
action (a) delivery of the imported water to Taiyuan and (b) optimal use of the expensive&#13;
imported water along with the existing local water, so as to minimize water use wastage&#13;
and to minimize and control environmental degradation in Taiyuan service area.&#13;
2.    Need for the Subloan Facility. In order to achieve the target of above item (b), it&#13;
is important to carried out comprehensive water pollution control especially industrial&#13;
pollution control (which is the major pollution source in Taiyuan City). However,&#13;
Taiyuan has been seriously short of funds for financing such works. During 1991 to 1995,&#13;
total annual investment was Y 618 million, averaging about Y 124 million per year,&#13;
compared with an estimated annual need of about Y 299 million. One measure that is&#13;
known to be very useful for helping fill this gap is use of a special revolving fund for&#13;
offering attractive low-service-charge loans to industries to encourage them to move&#13;
ahead using their own initiative and financing sources for planning/implementing needed&#13;
waste management program including recycling, reuse, and use of Clean Technologies,&#13;
including furnishing of technical assistance by TEPB to help industries plan cost-&#13;
effective programs with minimum or even negligible risks.&#13;
3.    Purpose of the Subloan Facility. A Pollution Control Subloan Facility totaling&#13;
$8.0 million was therefore proposed by Taiyuan EPB under this project for the&#13;
introduction of new pollution prevention technology. The purpose of the Facility is for&#13;
financing industrial enterprises in Taiyuan City to adopt Clean Technologies to reduce&#13;
and control their pollution to protect and improve the Fen River water quality and the&#13;
environment of Taiyuan.&#13;
Subloan Sources&#13;
4.    The local counterpart fund will come mainly from the special environment&#13;
protection investment from Shanxi Provincial and Taiyuan City Governments as well as&#13;
from enterprises' self-raised fund.&#13;
Subloan Management&#13;
5.   Institutional Frame. To effectively manage the Subloan, Taiyuan is to establish&#13;
a special body, the Subloan Administration Technical Committee (SATC), and an&#13;
executive agency, the Subloan Management Office (SMO), which are patterned after the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 239 -                    ANNEX 15&#13;
experience of Tianjin, which is also a major industrial center with problems of waste&#13;
management similar to these at Taiyuan.&#13;
6.    Figure 1 shows the operation framework for the Subloan management. The&#13;
normal operation involves various agencies including (a) Candidate Enterprises&#13;
(Applicants for Fund), (b) Government Agencies, (c) Subloan Management Office&#13;
(SMO), and (d) Subloan Administration Technical Committee (SATC). The key&#13;
components in fund management agencies are the SATC and the SMO.&#13;
7.    The Subloan Administration Committee (SATC) is in charge of Fund&#13;
management which comprises representatives of concerned government agencies&#13;
including TEPB, Taiyuan Planning Commission, and Taiyuan Finance Bureau with&#13;
TEPB at leading position. The major duties for Fund Board include:&#13;
(a)   Prepare directives and regulations for Fund use&#13;
(b)   Finance Bureau will set up an account for the fund&#13;
(c)   Set up loan approval conditions&#13;
(d)   Set up the SMO&#13;
(e)   Approval of SMO annual work plan&#13;
(f)   Approval of Subloan projects&#13;
(g)   Review of SMO annual report&#13;
8.    The SMO is an executive agency of the Fund Board. The members of the SMO&#13;
include a Director (Environmental Engineer), an economist, a finance expert, an&#13;
accountant and an office staff. The duties of the SMO include:&#13;
(a) Proposal for annual budget plan&#13;
(b) Appraisal of proposed projects&#13;
(c) Technical assistance to project enterprises&#13;
(d) Fund lending and recovering&#13;
(e) Annual reports, stage reports and other reports to Fund Board&#13;
9.    The Finance Bureau and Taiyuan Planing Commission are the key government&#13;
agencies responsible for the Subloan and TEPB will be the lead agency of the SATC.&#13;
Together with related government agencies, TEPB is responsible for the establishment of&#13;
the SATC Board and the SMO. Another important role of the TEPB is to solve, with&#13;
cooperation from other government agencies and support from City Government, any&#13;
problems in the operation of the Fund which are beyond the capabilities of the Fund&#13;
Board.&#13;
10.   The TEPB is considered to have a good background of experience for establishing&#13;
and maintaining the proposed fund. TEPB has already carried out preliminary efforts in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 240 -                     ANNEX 15&#13;
this field, including arranging for use of a fund of some Y 76 million over the period&#13;
1991-95. This included establishment of good working relationships with the Taiyuan&#13;
Finance Bureau and with industrial management bureaus of Taiyuan City, including&#13;
experience on project selection, project establishment, project review, and project&#13;
acceptance, and including development of appropriate capabilities in TEPB on related&#13;
managerial and financial analysis tasks.&#13;
11.   The Related Government Agencies other than TEPB are those City Government&#13;
Agencies responsible for planning and financing of industrial development and the&#13;
agencies of management authorities of different enterprises. Their functions include:&#13;
(a)   Participation in the Fund Board&#13;
(b)   Appraisal and permission of enterprises' proposals&#13;
(c)   Cooperation with TEPB in solving problems in Fund operation&#13;
12.   Fund Operation Procedure. As shown in Figure 1, initial proposals are to be&#13;
made by candidate enterprises and submitted to responsible government agencies for&#13;
review and permission. Then, formal proposals are submitted to the SMO for appraisal&#13;
with the criteria discussed below.&#13;
13.   Procedures for Processing Subloans.  The SMO with the use of local&#13;
consultants will be responsible for processing the subloans. The enterprises will prepare&#13;
an initial feasibility study which will be reviewed in detail by the SMO. The SMO will&#13;
appraise the proposals and submit the appraisal to the SATC for final approval. Prior&#13;
Bank review will only be needed for the first 3 subprojects and subsequent subprojects&#13;
over $1.0 million.&#13;
Criteria for selection of Candidate Enterprises&#13;
14.   Subborrower Eligibility Criteria. The subborrower must be in the following&#13;
types of industries: steel, chemicals including fertilizer, paper mills or pharmaceuticals.&#13;
Under the circumstances a loan will be made available under a first come/first serve basis&#13;
to industry who could meet the following criteria and subproject eligibility criteria: (a) is&#13;
a limited liability (shareholding) company or otherwise established as a legal entity; (b)&#13;
has a completed EIA approved by the TEPB and has a mitigation plan satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank; (c) has adopted the new accounting standards and its financial statements have&#13;
been audited by independent auditors; and (d) the company has been appraised and found&#13;
creditworthy by China Merchant Bank or Agriculture Bank of China.&#13;
15.   Subproject Eligibility Criteria. A grading points system is suggested by TEPB&#13;
with the mission for selection of Candidate Enterprises for loans from the Fund. The&#13;
system as shown in Table 2 assigns points to various criteria (12 items) according to their&#13;
relative importance and priority. The Fund Management Board will meet from time-to-&#13;
time to select the appropriate subprojects according to the criteria laid out.&#13;

-241-                      ANNEX 15&#13;
16.   Terms of the Subloan. The subloan terms will be as follows:&#13;
Interest Rate and Fees. Subborrowers will pay a commitment fee of 0.75 percent&#13;
on the undisbursed amount of the subloan. The minimum interest margin will be&#13;
2 percent over the Bank interest rate but could vary depending on the cost of&#13;
undertaking the required appraisal and loan processing, administrative overheads&#13;
for the SMO and repayment risk.&#13;
Maturity. The maturity of individual subloans will be no more than three years&#13;
grace and 8 years repayment period.&#13;
Rate of Return. Each subproject financed will have a financial rate and an&#13;
economic rate of return of no less than 11 percent.&#13;
17.   Conditions of Subloans. The maximum size of a loan cannot exceed $ 1.5&#13;
million. The costs of the subloan are mainly for pollution control equipment and services&#13;
and must not include the costs of civil works, taxes, or land.&#13;
18.   Procurement Procedures. All equipment contracts above $ 0.75 million will be&#13;
procured using ICB procedures, and between $ 0.3 and $ 0.75 million will be NCB&#13;
procedures. Items costing less than $ 0.3 million will be procured using shopping&#13;
procedures using three quotations. The accumulated total under shopping procedures will&#13;
not exceed $ 2.0 million.&#13;
Bank Loan Repayment&#13;
19.   The existing loan repay channels for fund operation being carried out by TEPB&#13;
are to be used. The World Bank Loan of $ 8.0 million will be returned annually with&#13;
same amount by Pollution Control Subsidy Fund coming from the overindex pollution&#13;
discharge fees which are collected by TEPB.&#13;
20.   The repayment by enterprises to the SMO mainly come from the profit of the&#13;
project enterprise. Enterprises may also use their self-raising fund for repayment to the&#13;
SMO which include self investment, local bank loan, and special investment from&#13;
government agencies.&#13;
Subloan Location&#13;
21.   The Provincial Finance Bureau will transfer the funds to the Taiyuan Municipal&#13;
Finance Bureau and will create an account in the Construction Bank of China (Taiyuan&#13;
Branch) for managing the World Bank Subloan and its repayment.&#13;

ANNEX 16: IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT ON&#13;
THE YELLOW RIVER BASIN&#13;
1.    The project would be a major water-consuming project in the mid-reach of the&#13;
Yellow River Basin. At full operation, it would divert about 2 percent of average annual&#13;
flow, and about 2.5 percent of a relatively dry year's flow. Much of this water will&#13;
therefore be unavailable to other users in the Basin, and its loss could have environmental&#13;
effects.&#13;
2.    The Yellow River is China's second longest (after the Yangtze) at 5,464 km. It&#13;
originates in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, and passes through nine provinces before&#13;
emptying into the Bohai Sea. An agricultural population of about 130 million is&#13;
dependent on the river, and millions more urban residents rely on it for their supplies. In&#13;
the near future, Yellow River water will be diverted as far as Beijing to supply municipal&#13;
needs.&#13;
3.    Mean annual flow is about 56 billion m3, with a high degree of variation. In one&#13;
out of four years flow is 46 billion or less. Runoff is highly seasonal, with about 60&#13;
percent occurring in the summer months July to October. Interannual storage is provided&#13;
by Longyanxia reservoir located in the far upper reaches, with a usable storage of about&#13;
22 billion mi. At present, only Liujaxia (downstream of Longyanxia) with a live storage&#13;
of 3 billion m', and Sanmenxia, located at the start of the lower reach with a live storage&#13;
of less than 1 billion mi, provide significant intraannual storage. Numerous diversion&#13;
barrages/run-of-river power plants dot the river in its upper and middle reaches, with&#13;
more under construction.&#13;
4.    Throughout recorded history, the major problems associated with the Yellow&#13;
River are floods and silt. Floods have killed millions, and wreaked untold havoc on the&#13;
economy of the river's lower reach. The Yellow River is also the heaviest silt-laden river&#13;
in the world. Flood control dikes have kept the river from "wandering" in recent decades,&#13;
but have also helped trap large volumes of sediment, leading to the phenomenon of part&#13;
of the lower reach being suspended above the surrounding plain by as much as 10 meters.&#13;
Most of the sediment originates in the Loess Plateau adjacent to the middle reach, and&#13;
during the peak flow summer months. Local experts estimate that 20-24 billion m3 per&#13;
year are required to flush sediment to the sea and minimize further riverbed aggradation.&#13;
The river is often dry at the mouth in the Spring months, due to a combination of low&#13;
runoff, peak irrigation demands, and insufficient storage downstream.&#13;
5.    China has long had detailed plans for the control of the river and the use of its&#13;
water. These plans include the maintenance of dikes to minimize the impacts of floods,&#13;
the construction of dams to regulate floods and sediment and to redistribute water to meet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 245 -                     ANNEX 16&#13;
seasonal demands and provide relief from droughts, and a water allocation scheme that&#13;
ensures economic development is balanced across sectors and water is equitably shared&#13;
among the nine provinces bordering the river.&#13;
6.    The project is one of the water supply projects included in the Yellow River Plan,&#13;
and has been sanctioned by the State Council. Other current projects include the Bank-&#13;
financed Xiaolangdi Dam, under construction downstream from Sanmenxia, which will&#13;
have about 12 billion m3 of storage to start, declining to about 5 after several years of&#13;
controlled siltation. It is primarily designed for flood control and silt management, but&#13;
will also generate substantial hydropower and permit improved water management for&#13;
lower-reach irrigation supplies and estuarial flows. With Xiaolangdi, flows at the mouth&#13;
can be theoretically maintained at a minimum of 30 m3/second, a level that can help&#13;
preserve the fish population and prevent other environmental degradations associated&#13;
with the mouth drying up. Xiaolangdi will be operational in about 1999. In addition,&#13;
Wanjiazhai Dam is under construction in the middle reach. It will have 0.9 billion m3 of&#13;
storage, generate power, and permit diversion of Yellow River water to mid-reach users&#13;
(including the project) before the river passes the Loess area and becomes silt-laden. One&#13;
or more dams are planned upstream of Xiaolangdi, which, if realized, will effectively&#13;
control all but flood flows. Also under consideration is the transfer of very large volumes&#13;
from the Yangtze River to the Yellow, for later use in the lower Yellow River Basin and&#13;
other water-short areas in northern China.&#13;
7.    The project begs several questions with regard to its potential impact on the&#13;
Yellow River Basin, in particular, the lower reach:&#13;
*  Will the project exacerbate the recurring problem of the Yellow River running&#13;
dry at its mouth?&#13;
*  Will the project reduce the volumes of water required to flush sediment from&#13;
the lower reach?&#13;
*  Will Shanxi Province remain within its allocation of Yellow River water after&#13;
the project?&#13;
*  Who among consumers of Yellow River water will suffer when the project&#13;
diverts water from other uses?&#13;
*  What are the economic opportunity costs of project diversions, and how do the&#13;
economic returns compare with other potential uses for diverted water?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 246 -                      ANNEX 16&#13;
Methodology&#13;
8.    The problems of and plans for the Yellow River were investigated at some length&#13;
in a Bank report prepared in conjunction with the analysis of the Xiaolangdi Project.'"&#13;
That study used, as its primary tool of analysis, a nonlinear programming model of the&#13;
Basin's water supplies, demands, and constraining factors, including the need to generate&#13;
hydroelectric power, and manage water so as to minimize the impact of floods. The&#13;
model, called the Yellow River Basin Level Model (BLM) is used to simulate the variety&#13;
of potential impacts that the project diversions may have. The results of the model can be&#13;
expected to be robust with respect to states of nature because it is solved for all 56 years&#13;
of available hydrologic data (water inflow).&#13;
Estuarial Flows and Sediment Management&#13;
9.    Under present (1995) conditions of water demand, the BLM estimates that the&#13;
average annual flow at the estuary is 22 billion m3, and that the flow is about 13 billion&#13;
m3 in relatively dry years.'I The probability that the 20 billion mi3 minimum required for&#13;
sediment flushing can be met is 0.46. Furthermore, the model shows that the river is dry&#13;
at the mouth in 22 percent of months, most often in March, April and May when&#13;
irrigation demands peak. The results are shown in column (1) of Table 1. Clearly, the&#13;
current state of affairs is not satisfactory from an environmental perspective.&#13;
10.   Other things equal, in 2000 the probability of not having 20 billion m3 falls to&#13;
0.41 and the frequency of dry months increases to 28 percent solely due to the impact of&#13;
increasing water demands throughout the Basin, and increases in diversions to other areas&#13;
such as Beijing and Qingdao (Table 1, column 2). However, these simulations ignore the&#13;
regulating capabilities of Xiaolangdi and Wanjiazhai dams, which will be available about&#13;
2000. When these new facilities are taken into account, the results improve dramatically.&#13;
11.   In column (3) the storage facilities at Xiaolangdi and Wanjiazhai are added, and&#13;
Xiaolangdi operated to so as to provide a 30 m3/second flow at the mouth if possible&#13;
(30 m3/second = 0.08 billion m3/month). The minimum flow can be achieved in all&#13;
months of all simulated years, and the average flow rises to 21 billion m3.  The&#13;
probability of achieving the 20 billion m3 level rises to 43 percent, back where it was in&#13;
1995. Clearly, Xiaolangdi, if operated as intended, can significantly increase the water&#13;
available for sediment management (as it was designed to do) as well as provide&#13;
continual flows at the mouth.&#13;

12.   How will the project affect these results? The same simulations were made with&#13;
the project diversions, and the results are shown in column (4). As the bottom line&#13;
shows, the minimum flows at the mouth can again be met in every month of every year.&#13;
Obviously, the relatively small volumes diverted to the project will not eradicate the&#13;
ability of Xiaolangdi, located about 400 km downstream from the Wanjiazhai diversion&#13;
point, to manage estuarial flows. Furthermore, there are no significant differences in the&#13;
annual flows at the mouth. In most years, these flows decline by 240 milion m3, just&#13;
over 1 percent. This is because there are return flows from project water diverted to&#13;
Taiyuan via the Fen River. In general, returns from M&amp;I diversions to the Fen River are&#13;
about 80 percent. Given the seasonality of irrigation demands, about half of returns are&#13;
usable by farmers, who have a typical efficiency of 50 percent. Thus, only 40 percent of&#13;
project diversions to Taiyuan will actually be consumed, and 60 percent will eventually&#13;
return to the Yellow River. The percentage will increase if and when Phase II of the&#13;
Project commences, because water diverted along the northern route will not return to the&#13;
Yellow.&#13;
13.   Clearly, there is not enough water in the Yellow River in most years to meet all&#13;
the future demands and provide the desired flow to fully manage sediment. But with&#13;
Xiaolangdi, the environmental problems, particularly those associated with lack of water&#13;
at the estuary, are mitigated, and Xiaolangdi both increases the volumes of water&#13;
available for sediment management, and vastly improves the efficiency of use of those&#13;
volumes. Project diversions neither alter the ability of Xiaolangdi to accomplish this, nor&#13;
significantly reduce the volumes of water available for it.&#13;
Project and Provincial Allocations&#13;
14.   Recognizing that water shortages in the Yellow River Basin were becoming&#13;
increasingly frequent, the State Council adopted in 1987 limits on diversions (gross&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 248 -                     ANNEX 16&#13;
consumption) for each of the nine provinces bordering the river. Including 2 billion m3&#13;
allocated for the Hebei-Beijing transfer, they total 37 billion m3, of which Shanxi's&#13;
allocated share is 4.31 billion m3. This limit only applies to that part of Shanxi that lies&#13;
within the Yellow River Basin, not to that lying within the Hai Basin, and not to&#13;
groundwater use.&#13;
15.   The question, then, is will the diversions from the project, which will eventually&#13;
reach 1.2 billion m3/year, keep Shanxi's use of Yellow River water less than 4.31 billion&#13;
mi3? To answer this, we must first estimate Shanxi's potential consumption of local&#13;
Yellow River water (mainly the Fen River and the Yellow tributaries flowing out of&#13;
Shanxi). These estimates were made with the use of the Provincial Planning Model&#13;
(PPM)]2 and are shown in the "consumption" line of Table 2. The numbers are not based&#13;
on any future planning scenario, but reflect what level of consumption is possible given&#13;
the seasonality of surface water availability, the limits of water storage availability, and&#13;
the efficiency of water conveyance structures.  In half of the years (PSO), 3.17&#13;
consumption is possible from nonproject sources, 2.95 is possible in dry years, and only&#13;
2.07 in very dry years.&#13;
16.   Comparing these levels of feasible consumption with the allocation, the table&#13;
shows that even at full operation (including the Phase II supplies to Datong and&#13;
Pingshuo), Shanxi will remain with the limit in all but the median year, and then only&#13;
exceed it by a small margin. However, the limits only apply in water years drier than&#13;
P50. In the P75 year, Shanxi comes close to reaching its limit, which is why the project&#13;
will undoubtedly be the last possible project that draws water from the Yellow River.&#13;

Project and Changes in Diversions&#13;
17.   With its offtake at Wanjiazhai Dam located in the upper middle reach, the project&#13;
begs the question of whether the water it takes will reduce diversions (and hence&#13;
consumption) to all areas downstream of it. The simple answer is no so long as water&#13;
12 "Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Background Study. Economics Volume." World Bank (September 1996).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 249 -                     ANNEX 16&#13;
demands in the provinces upstream of Shanxi do not exceed their allocations. Above, we&#13;
saw that flows to the Sea decline by the volume of water consumed by the project (240&#13;
million m3/year at full development of Phase I, and 800 million m3/year when Phase II is&#13;
completed). The same simulations also showed that diversions to the downstream&#13;
provinces were unaffected by the project. This is because the model (as well as Chinese&#13;
water management policy) gives preference to water demands up to provincial allocation&#13;
limits so long as the economic returns from meeting those demands are positive.&#13;
Economic returns to downstream water use are sufficiently high (though not nearly as&#13;
high as those from project diversions) that any decrease in river flow will be taken from&#13;
flows to the Sea, not from consumptive uses.&#13;
18.   Only if the upstream provinces unlawfully exceed their allocation limits will&#13;
downstream water shortages appear, which may cause a direct conflict between Shanxi&#13;
and the downstream users. This situation is not likely to arise given (a) the close&#13;
monitoring of consumption of Yellow River water by the water authorities, and (b) the&#13;
limited upstream consumption capacity due to limited water storage and control facilities.&#13;
Indeed, the BLM showed that the upstream provinces would not exceed their allocations&#13;
even under the most optimistic development plans imagined for the year 2020.&#13;
Opportunity Costs of Project Diversions&#13;
19.   If the project will not reduce the water available to downstream users, then the&#13;
economic opportunity cost of the water diverted should be zero. The environmental&#13;
opportunity cost will always be positive, given that the consumed water will not be&#13;
available for sediment flushing, etc., but this number is exceedingly difficult to measure.&#13;
But it is entirely possible that future irrigation development downstream, or addition&#13;
schemes to transfer water out of the Basin may lead to lower-reach water shortages,&#13;
which cannot be met by curtailing flows to the sea. If this should occur, then the&#13;
economic opportunity cost will no longer be zero.&#13;
20.   To estimate what that cost might be, we again used the BLM, recognizing that the&#13;
residual water consumer will likely be irrigators in the downstream provinces of Henan&#13;
and Shandong. The BLM estimated that, under 2000 conditions of cropping patterns,&#13;
crop yields, and efficiency of water use, the marginal returns to downstream irrigators&#13;
would be Y 1.25/m3. Any reduction in their water supplies would therefore incur an&#13;
economic cost of Y 1 .25/m3. Since only 40 percent of water diverted to the project would&#13;
be consumed (lost), then the opportunity cost of diverting water to the project is 0.4*1.25&#13;
= Y 0.5/mi3. This cost is included in the economic analysis of Phase I of the Project. In&#13;
Phase II, the cost will increase to about Y 1I/m3 since a lower percentage of diverted water&#13;
will return.&#13;

ANNEX 17: DAM SAFETY AND EMERGENCY&#13;
PREPAREDNESS&#13;
A. DAM SAFETY&#13;
1.    Fen-l Dam. The dam was completed in 1961 for flood control, irrigation, water&#13;
supply and power generation. The homogeneous earthfill dam is 61.4m high, with total&#13;
storage capacity of 731 million m3 corresponding to Ei. 1130.2m. But the accumulated&#13;
volume of siltation reached 347 million m3 by October 1995. At present, the storage&#13;
capacity is reduced to 384 million m3. The monitoring data of more than 30 years show&#13;
that the performance behavior of the dam is in normal condition.&#13;
2.    The Fen-1 Reservoir will provide 120 million m 3 storage for the period when&#13;
pumping is not possible from Wanjiazhai Reservoir. In addition, it can also provide&#13;
supplementary supply about 40 to 110 million m 3 of water from Fenhe river basin&#13;
through optimized regulation for Haoshuigou, Fen-1 and Fen-2 Reservoirs. The intake&#13;
structure of the pipeline of the Connecting Works is located at the right abutment of Fen-&#13;
1 dam.&#13;
3.    The general layout of the dam, its main features, instrumentation, siltation and&#13;
other status have been described in a Preappraisal Report prepared by Mr. Zhao&#13;
Chuanshao in November 1995. The status of Dam Safety Inspection, Operation and&#13;
Maintenance Plan and Emergency Preparedness Plan are described below.&#13;
4.    Dam Safety Inspection. Since impoundment of reservoir, seepage around the&#13;
left abutment has been found, and remedial works were undertaken. Treatment had been&#13;
taken in 1964, 1973 and 1981. Because of siltation, the storage capacity of reservoir was&#13;
reduced significantly. For the purpose of ensuring dam safety against floods, the dam has&#13;
been heightened by 1.4m in 1978 and an additional outlet tunnel with diameter of 8m was&#13;
completed in May 1995. Each time before the implementation of rehabilitation, the ad&#13;
hoc Panel of Experts has been involved in safety inspection, design review and&#13;
construction supervision. In 1990, safety inspection was also carried out by the reservoir&#13;
management identification team led by MWR. As for the regular safety inspection, it has&#13;
not been organized yet.&#13;
5.    Based on the Operational Policies of the World Bank, it is required that Shanxi&#13;
Province will appoint an independent Panel of experts to carry out regularly the dam&#13;
safety inspection once every five years and will submit the Panel's reports to the Bank,&#13;
starting with the first report on October 31, 1998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 251-                           ANNEX 17&#13;
6.     The Terms of Reference for Fen-I Dam  Safety Inspection Panel is provided as&#13;
Attachment 1.&#13;
7.     Operation and Maintenance Plan. The Operation Plan for Flood Control is&#13;
prepared annually before the rainy season by Fen- 1 Reservoir Management Bureau and&#13;
then approved by Provincial Flood Protection Headquarters. The Plan includes the&#13;
general description, the siltation status of the reservoir, the performance behavior of the&#13;
dam and appurtenant structures, the flood regulating criteria and results, as well as&#13;
emergency preparedness measures.&#13;
8.     The Operation Plan for Water Supply which is separate from flood control, is also&#13;
prepared annually by Fen- I Reservoir Management Bureau based on the water inflow of&#13;
the previous year and approved by the Provincial Water Resources Department. In recent&#13;
years, the annual water supplies for irrigation, industry and municipality were about 150&#13;
and 40 million m3 respectively.&#13;
9.     Monitoring of instrumentation was carried out regularly. The frequencies of data&#13;
collection such as settlement, displacement, pore pressure, phreatic line, seepage etc.&#13;
were different depending upon the variation tendency derived from accumulated data of&#13;
previous years for different instruments. However, before and after flood season of each&#13;
year, a comprehensive and detailed data collection were thoroughly undertaken. During&#13;
major floods, the collection intervals were shortened. At the same time, visual inspections&#13;
were carried out in detail.&#13;
10.    Regular maintenance work has been implemented on a small scale. But after&#13;
completion of the dam, rehabilitation programs have been undertaken for several times.&#13;
The major programs, such as dam heightening and construction of an additional 8m outlet&#13;
tunnel, were designed by SIDI and approved by MWR.&#13;
11.    Emergency Preparedness Plan. 'f'he crest elevation of Fen-I1 dam is 1,131 .4m.&#13;
While the top elevation of the reinforced concrete parapet wall is 1, 13 3.3m. It is stated in&#13;
Operation Plan for Flood Control that the highest pool levels corresponding to different&#13;
probabilities are as follows:&#13;
Flood Peak Discharge   Highest Pool Level  Corresponding  Maximum Outflow&#13;
Probability      (M3l/sec)             (i)Storage                         Discharge&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 252 -                    ANNEX 17&#13;
12.   If an extremely large flood occurs and the pool level goes up to 1,130m,&#13;
emergency measures should be started according to order issued by Provincial Flood&#13;
Protection Headquarters (PFPH). The emergency task forces, including the army, public&#13;
utilities and farmers, will promptly arrive to the damsite to heighten urgently the dam by&#13;
constructing a small dike to the elevation 1, 1 34.3m. At the same time, the PFPH will call&#13;
for immediate evacuation of the downstream affected area.&#13;
13.  In case the pool level ups to 1,131m, the saddle dam on right bank would be&#13;
artificially broken, if necessary. The maximum discharge due to this artificial breaking&#13;
would be 83,500 m3/second. According to the result of flood routing, the maximum&#13;
discharge at Yingze Bridge, Taiyuan City would be 40,000 m3/second, much greater than&#13;
the allowable 3,450 m3/second.&#13;
14.   The Emergency Preparedness Plan has been preliminarily considered in the&#13;
Operation Plan for Flood Protection. But it seems not complete enough. It is suggested&#13;
that more detailed Emergency Preparedness Plan be proceeded, taking into account the&#13;
Guidelines for Emergency Preparedness Plan, provided as Attachment 3.&#13;
15.   Wanjiazhai Dam. The Wanjiazhai Dam is located on the main stem of the&#13;
Yellow River in the middle reach, 30 km northwest of Pianguan County, Shanxi&#13;
Province. The dam is of concrete gravity type, 105m high, with the total storage and&#13;
regulating capacity of 896 and 445 million m3 respectively. The two intakes for the&#13;
YRDP are set up in the dam near the left abutment.&#13;
16.   The dam is not under the Yellow River Diversion Project, but is being constructed&#13;
by MWR. By the end of 1995, 256,000 m3 of concrete have been placed in the dam body.&#13;
According to the schedule, 500,000 m3 of concrete will be placed in 1996. It is planned&#13;
that the dam will be completed by the end of 1998.&#13;
17.   Detailed description of the dam was given in "Current Status of Design and&#13;
Construction of Wanjiazhai Water Project on Yellow River" prepared by Messrs. Zhang&#13;
Zezhen and Chen Yiming on September 30, 1995. The Dam Safety Inspection, Operation&#13;
and Maintenance Plan and Emergency Preparedness Plan are discussed below.&#13;
18.   Dam Safety Inspection. The design of the dam is prepared by TIDI. It has been&#13;
reviewed by China International Engineering Consultative Corporation in 1990 and by&#13;
General Planning and Design Institute, MWR in 1993 and 1995. A special team of&#13;
experts has visited the damsite providing consultancy on the design in October 1991. Up&#13;
to now, no permanent Panel of Experts has been set up.&#13;
19.   Through Local Competitive Bidding, the contracts of the dam and the hydropower&#13;
plant were awarded to the 4th and 6th Construction Bureaus of Hydro and Hydropower&#13;
respectively. The Northeast Hydro and Hydropower Investigation and Design Institute&#13;
undertakes the construction supervision, acting as Engineer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 253 -                     ANNEX 17&#13;
20.   Taking into account the importance of the dam project and also based on the&#13;
operational policies of the World Bank, it is recommended that the Dam Safety&#13;
Inspection Panel will be organized by MWR to undertake periodic, comprehensive and&#13;
independent review to evaluate features and actions pertaining to the safety of the dam&#13;
and appurtenant structures during the course of construction and operation. For the&#13;
purpose of satisfactory implementation, the Terms of Reference for Wanjiazhai Dam&#13;
Safety Inspection Panel is provided as Attachment 2.&#13;
21.   Operation and Maintenance Plan. Due to the high silt content of Yellow River&#13;
during flood season, the basic criterion of the operation program of the reservoir involves&#13;
impounding the clear water and discharging the muddy water. Each year in August and&#13;
September, the pool level will usually be lowered to 952-957 m for flushing the sediment.&#13;
From mid July to mid October, the pool level should not be higher than 966 m for&#13;
maintaining the storage capacity of flood regulation.   The highest pool level&#13;
corresponding to 1: 10,000 years flood would be 979.1 m.&#13;
22.   The impoundment of the reservoir will be started in mid-October.  From&#13;
November to February of next year, the pool level shall be maintained at 975 m or lower&#13;
for ice control, because this is the period of ice flowing before freezing-up. From the&#13;
beginning of March to the beginning of April, the pool level shall be lowered to 970 m&#13;
for melting ice control. After that time, the pool level can be raised to 980 m.&#13;
23.   The above mentioned operation program  is stipulated in principle in the&#13;
preliminary design. The maintenance program has not been prepared yet. It is suggested&#13;
that the Operation and Maintenance Plan should be prepared before initial reservoir&#13;
filling, generally in conformity with the guidelines given in Attachment 4.&#13;
24.   Emergency Preparedness Plan. According to the preliminary design, the results&#13;
of flood regulation are as follows:&#13;
Probability   Flood Peak      Highest Pool    Correspondin      Maximum&#13;

0.1          16,500           974.99           200             7,784&#13;
0.02          19,800          977.79            269             8,086&#13;
0.01         21,200            979.1            302             8,221&#13;
25.   During discussion, TIDI considered that there are following favorable conditions&#13;
preventing the failure of the dam:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 254 -                    ANNEX 17&#13;
(a)   The dam is built on sound and thick limestone foundation without&#13;
developed geotechnical structures, and is located in the region of low&#13;
seismic intensity (six degree).&#13;
(b)   The results of flood regulation did not include the service of the surface&#13;
spillway, which will be operated as extraordinary measure with additional&#13;
discharge capacity of 864 m3/second.&#13;
(c)   In case of emergency, the pool level can be drawn down from 977m to&#13;
915m in five days with the help of large discharge capacity of medium and&#13;
bottom outlet works.&#13;
(d)   The crest elevation of the concrete gravity dam is 982m, with the&#13;
freeboard of 2.9m above highest flood pool level. Even the extremely big&#13;
flood should occur, the sustainability of the gravity dam against&#13;
overtopping would be considerable.&#13;
26.   TIDI has examined the effects of a check flood of 1 in 10,000 years, however,&#13;
they have not examined the effect of the PMF type flood and dam failure caused by&#13;
nuclear attack.&#13;
27.   As for the instrumentation and monitoring system, flood forecasting and&#13;
communication system, and other facilities which are closely related to safety of regular&#13;
operation and in case of emergency, have been designed.&#13;
28.   Downstream of the dam, the existing Tianqiao hydropower station is located 110&#13;
km from Wanjiazhai, and also some villages, townships exist on small flood plains in&#13;
Yellow River tributaries. The Tianqiao hydropower station is composed of 190m long&#13;
concrete gravity dam on the left bank and 330m long earthfill dam on the right bank. The&#13;
heights of the concrete and earthfill dams are 42 and 23m respectively. While the storage&#13;
capacity of the reservoir is 66 million m3, and the installed generating capacity is 128&#13;
MW. The maximum discharge capacity of spillway is 17,010 m3/second corresponding to&#13;
the probability of 0.2 percent&#13;
29.   The Owner of the Wanjiazhai dam project is Wanjiazhai Dam Construction&#13;
Management Bureau (WDCMB), under MWR. At present, the Emergency Preparedness&#13;
Plan has not been formulated yet. Considering the importance of the dam and the&#13;
catastrophic consequence of the dam incident, assurance have been obtained during&#13;
negotiations that an Emergency Preparedness Plan would be formulated by WDCMB&#13;
taking into account the Guide Lines for Emergency Preparedness Plan (Attachment 3) by&#13;
December 31, 1998.&#13;

- 259 -                     ANNEX 17&#13;
ATTACHMENT 3: GUIDELINES FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN&#13;
1.    A detailed Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) should be established for each&#13;
dam within the drainage area or operating system as a whole. If there is more than one&#13;
system operating within the same drainage area, the EPP should be coordinated by a joint&#13;
committee on emergency operation composed of representatives of all operating&#13;
organizations. The EPP should be approved by the Goveniment Agency.&#13;
2.    EPP should be reviewed at regular intervals for the need of updating and&#13;
adaptation to alterations of the physical and social environment, if necessary.&#13;
Appropriate intervals for the review may be periods of five to ten years depending upon&#13;
the progress of regional development.&#13;
3.    EPP should deal with, but not be limited to, the following aspects:&#13;
* hydrographic observation and flood warning scheme;&#13;
. drawdown and flood control operation of reservoir;&#13;
. emergency emptying of the reservoir;&#13;
. inundation maps for flows up to the design flood, and for catastrophic&#13;
conditions caused by dam failure;&#13;
* evacuation of flood-threatened areas;&#13;
. rescue operations and other emergency provisions;&#13;
. equipment, material and support available for emergency relief;&#13;
. coordination of emergency relief actions with third parties (for instance: civil&#13;
defense, police, hospitals, etc.);&#13;
. emergency standby of public utilities;&#13;
. emergency operation of power plant, water supply scheme associated with the&#13;
dam;&#13;
* emergency warning;&#13;
* emergency communication;&#13;
* emergency transportation;&#13;
. emergency access to the damsite;&#13;
* emergency decision-making process and procedures.&#13;
4.    EPP may be done for several types and modes of emergency but should include&#13;
the analysis of the most severe possibility; that is, the instantaneous failure of the dam.&#13;
The possible effect of the failure of upstream dams should also be taken into account.&#13;
5.    EPP should cope with emergency precautions and possible emergency repair&#13;
measures at the dam site and with warning and emergency relief action downstream of&#13;
the dam.&#13;
6.    Flood warning and emergency warning systems should be checked for reliability&#13;
and efficiency before the beginning of each flood season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 260 -                    ANNEX 17&#13;
7.    EPP should include instructions to be followed by the local operating staff in the&#13;
event of loss of communications with the leading control agency.&#13;
8.   In case of imminent danger or of a major accident, corrective action must be taken&#13;
immediately and independently of normal administrative procedures. Enough authority&#13;
should be vested in the operator's top level technical personnel to order emergency&#13;
preventive or repair measures without asking for special authorization from management.&#13;
9.    Clear and easily understandable emergency instructions should be issued to all&#13;
operating units. These emergency instructions, which must include a definition of the&#13;
supervising units authorized or obliged to issue orders under emergency conditions,&#13;
should be easily accessible. The need for updating should be checked periodically and&#13;
always after institutional, operational and administrative changes.&#13;
10.   Operating staff should be trained and periodically retrained in emergency&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 261-                      ANNEX 17&#13;
ATTACHMENT 4: GUIDELINES FOR DAM OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
1.    The operation of a dam and reservoir needs to be understood in the context of the&#13;
multiple user who are involved, contractual agreements therewith, and best efforts&#13;
possible to optimize benefits for all.&#13;
2.    For each dam and reservoir, a reservoir capacity allocation scheme should be&#13;
prepared. The scheme should usually include the following items:&#13;
* Reservoir capacity allocation for different uses at several elevations and a&#13;
reference to the use allocations made in planning and designing the project.&#13;
. Flood regulation criteria and flood discharges.&#13;
* Sediment regulating rules and siltation.&#13;
* Water supply for irrigation.&#13;
. Water supply for municipal and industrial uses.&#13;
* Hydropower generating operation.&#13;
3.    To ensure the operational safety, the performance of the dam and appurtenant&#13;
structures should be carefully monitored. The monitoring should include, but not be&#13;
limited to, the following items:&#13;
4.    Instrumentation system, including the surface and embedded devices, should be&#13;
monitored at regular intervals. The accuracy of data obtained from the readings should be&#13;
checked annually for two or three years after commissioning of the dam and later at&#13;
longer intervals. The actual loads and loading combinations acting upon the structure&#13;
should be compared with those of the original design. At the same time, the original&#13;
design criteria and safety strategy should be reviewed with emphasis on the compatibility&#13;
with current technology.&#13;
5.    Visual examination of structures should be carried out at regular intervals. The&#13;
exposed surfaces of a concrete dam and appurtenant concrete structures should be&#13;
visually examined for cracks, spelling, leaching, leakage, indication of deterioration or&#13;
chemical reactions and damage from erosion or cavitation, etc.&#13;
6.    Earth rock fill embankments should be examined for cracks, leakage, saturated&#13;
areas, springs, sinkholes, evidence of piping, erosion, frost heave, crest alignment,&#13;
bulging or depression of slopes and berms, animal burrows, and the deterioration of&#13;
riprap or other slope protection materials.&#13;
7.    If the visual examination reveals evidence of material deterioration or unsafe&#13;
structural behavior, or yields doubts about the structural and/or operational safety, a more&#13;
in-depth investigation by core drilling, excavation of observation pits and/or other&#13;
appropriate methods should be initiated immediately.&#13;
8.    Underwater examinatioi should be made periodically for those parts which are&#13;
permanently submerged, such as lower part of the upstream slope or face of a dam and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 262 -                     ANNEX 17&#13;
stilling basins. The examination can be implemented by sounding and/or by underwater&#13;
television camera.&#13;
9.    Drainage systems and uplift pressure relief devices should be examined for&#13;
possible obstruction, deterioration or damage by chemical reactions or bacterial growth.&#13;
Sources of seepage should be pinpointed and flow rate and quality (clear or muddy water)&#13;
should be investigated for comparison with previous observations and the results of&#13;
permeability computations.  Any anomalous changes in seepage volume shall be&#13;
investigated immediately.&#13;
10.   All mechanical and associated electrical equipment of the dam  should be&#13;
examined for proper functioning and adequate maintenance. Besides the accuracy of&#13;
operating performance, inspection should extend to lubrication and the functional&#13;
integrity of the equipment. Corroded, damaged or worn parts shall be replaced. An&#13;
adequate stock of spare parts must be maintained throughout the dam's service life.&#13;
11.   The service and emergency power sources and transmission should be examined&#13;
with special attention to the power supply under region-wide natural catastrophic&#13;
conditions.&#13;
12.   Siltation of the reservoir should be annually monitored by sounding.&#13;
13.   Critical areas of the reservoir rim should be inspected annually for five years and&#13;
later at least every three years for landslides and the indication of the development of&#13;
problems that might affect the safety of the dam or reservoir.&#13;
14.   The whole reservoir and its surroundings should remain under permanent&#13;
surveillance with respect to possible health problems. If foci of waterborne or water-&#13;
related diseases should develop, they must be brought under specialized medical control&#13;
immediately.&#13;
15.   Though pollution is normally not a direct consequence of reservoir or dam&#13;
operation, the operation unit should make every possible effort to detect sources of&#13;
pollution in order to enable the public health and other government authorities to enforce&#13;
pollution control.&#13;
16.   The adequacy and proper functioning of monitoring instruments and devices&#13;
should be checked at least every two years. The accuracy and correct functioning of the&#13;
hydrographic observation system, inclusive of telemetering and transmission devices,&#13;
should be checked before the beginning of every flood season.&#13;
17.   The sequence and frequency of the reading of monitoring instruments and&#13;
observation devices should follow the specific instructions given by the designer during&#13;
initial stage of operation, and later on can be revised according to the variation tendency&#13;
derived from accumulated data of previous years for different instruments and devices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 263 -                     ANNEX 17&#13;
18.   The readings of monitoring system should be processed and interpreted without&#13;
delay. Data and information should be carefully identified and filed for appraisal and&#13;
reference during the periodic inspections. Any substantial deviation from previous&#13;
observations or the anticipated behavior of the structure shall be brought immediately to&#13;
the attention of the inspection team.&#13;
19.   An inspection schedule should be established jointly by the operator and the&#13;
inspection team. This schedule should be set utp in accordance with the convenience and&#13;
requirements of operation. It would be advantageous to schedule the principal inspection&#13;
activities to coincide with major maintenance operations to facilitate the inspection of&#13;
equipment and the dewatering of water conduits, pump pits etc..&#13;
20.   A description of the methods and procedures employed for inspection and the&#13;
findings and resulting recommendations should be summarized in the inspection report.&#13;
Detected irregularities should be mapped for future reference and comparison. If any&#13;
remedial actions are deemed necessary, they should be proposed by clear&#13;
recommendations.  The report should be prepared immediately after finishing the&#13;
inspection and issued without delay.&#13;

            The Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project is
            part of a phased development program to expand the water
            supply and improve the land and water environment in the
            northern Shanxi province.  Specific objectives include: a)
            reducing water supply infrastructure bottlenecks; b)
            increasing employment and incomes; reducing the urban
            distress caused by insufficient and intermittent water
            supplies; d) environmental improvement by ending the over
            extraction of groundwater and treating all waste; e)
            creating a system to rationalize water use and reduce
            greater shortages and f) promoting integrated management and
            financial independence for water institutions.  The project
            will include the following components: a) Yellow River
            Diversion Project Corporation (YRDPC), providing the
            physical works needed to transfer water from the yellow
            River through a system of tunnels, aqueduct pipelines and
            reservoirs; b) water resources institutional reform; and c)
            water pollution control and industrial waste management.
