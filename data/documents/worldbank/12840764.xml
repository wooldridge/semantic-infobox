            World Bank Group client governments as
            well as donors often ask about the effects of business entry
            reforms and the persistence of those effects. Four clear
            findings emerge from existing research. First, more firms
            enter the market when registration procedures and costs are
            cut. Second, a large percentage of new firms survive and
            grow. Third, new firms increase competition, forcing
            incumbents to become more efficient or to exit the market
            and boosting overall productivity and investment. Finally,
            entry reforms have greater impacts when coupled with other
            investment climate reforms.
