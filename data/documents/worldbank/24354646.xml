INTRCDUCTION&#13;
i.     The Consultative Group to ,ssist the Poor (CGAP) is a global partnership of organizations that&#13;
seek to advance financial inclusion f r the poor. CGAP develops innovative solutions to address barriers&#13;
to financial inclusion through practial research and active engagement with financial service providers,&#13;
policy makers, and funders.&#13;
2.     Established in 1995, CGAP initially played a critical role in building a sustainable microfinance&#13;
industry, facilitating consensus around good practice standards and helping to professionalize the field.&#13;
Starting in the mid-2000s, CGAP ft cused on promoting a diversity of financial services and providers,&#13;
and in particular technology and business model innovations that have the potential to dramatically&#13;
increase the scale and lower the cost! of financial services for poor people.&#13;
3.     Today, CGAP is a leading global resource on financial inclusion for the poor. CGAP acts&#13;
through high-level advocacy, resear h and knowledge sharing on client demand, support for product and&#13;
business model innovation, policy ac vice, and guidelines and standards for donor effectiveness.&#13;
4.     CGAP pursues a global solu ions agenda through a portfolio of high-impact initiatives that evolve&#13;
over time to adapt to changing mark.t developments. CGAP's work on frontier issues crowds-in private,&#13;
social, and public sector entities and reflects the two central purposes of subsidized catalytic capital in the&#13;
promotion of inclusive market devel)pment: (i) the generation of open knowledge, open data, and related&#13;
practical insights of a public goo&lt; nature, and (ii) private and public sector experimentations that&#13;
demonstrate viable product and business model innovations.&#13;
5.     CGAP is guided by five-yet r strategic frameworks. Its current five year framework, Advancing&#13;
Financial Inclusion to Improve the lives of the Poor, Strategic Directions FY2014 - FY2018 (CGAP V),&#13;
