      quity capital flows into microfinance have been increasing for many years, with both retail&#13;
      and institutional investors showing interest in this sector of financial services. Despite&#13;
      this growth, the vast majority of equity investments are still made in the form of private&#13;
placements, as there are only three publicly traded microfinance institutions (Equity Bank in&#13;
Kenya, Compartamos in Mexico, and SKS in India). The difficulty in accessing private data&#13;
and the scarcity of publicly listed entities have limited the scope of the market research&#13;
available to equity investors in microfinance institutions.&#13;
&#13;
To address this research gap, CGAP and J.P. Morgan joined efforts in 2009 to publish&#13;
an annual Global Microfinance Equity Valuation Survey Report. This partnership benefits&#13;
from the deep microfinance market knowledge of CGAP and the emerging markets equity&#13;
research skills of J.P. Morgan. In the past two years, it has also benefited from the support&#13;
and industry experience of the Council of Microfinance Equity Funds (CMEF). The aim of&#13;
these yearly publications is to provide benchmarks for the valuation of microfinance&#13;
equity, both private and publicly listed, to promote market transparency and identify&#13;
industry trends.&#13;
&#13;
This yearâ&#128;&#153;s report is the fourth edition of this research partnership. Previous editions of&#13;
the report are available on the J.P. Morgan and CGAP Web sites.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T&#13;
       oward the end of 2010, the asset quality of many microfinance&#13;
       institutions (MFIs) began to recover from a crisis of client over-&#13;
       indebtedness and unsustainable growth, particularly in India,&#13;
Bosnia, and Nicaragua.1 During 2011 and into 2012, this recovery con-&#13;
tinued to bring higher microfinance equity transaction volumes.2 Based&#13;
on the responses gathered in this yearâ&#128;&#153;s survey, the private equity (PE)&#13;
markets experienced an important increase in deal activity from the&#13;
slower pace recorded in 2010. Large transactions in Latin America and&#13;
the Caribbean (LAC) as well as strong flows from development finance&#13;
institutions (DFIs) in India drove the increase in both the volume and&#13;
the number of transactions.&#13;
    While asset quality improved and transaction volumes increased,&#13;
equity valuations continued to decline in 2011 from their peak in 2010,&#13;
reversing the multiple expansion that had taken place up until then.&#13;
This is likely due to lingering uncertainties about asset quality in some&#13;
markets and continued public scrutiny, which was most pronounced in&#13;
a few countries making up a significant portion of our sample (and the&#13;
market), such as India. In 2011, our comparables in the public market&#13;
also declined with a drop in the average valuation of the Lower Income&#13;
Finance Institutions (LIFIs) Index.3 We believe this reflects a wider&#13;
trend where LIFI and microfinance valuations in the public and pri-&#13;
vate markets are beginning to converge toward those of traditional fi-&#13;
nancial institutions in emerging markets.&#13;
    Section 1 of this report examines the landscape of PE deals. It fol-&#13;
lows the methodology of previous surveys and discusses valuation&#13;
trends and new market developments (see Box 1 for more details on&#13;
this methodology). This section also delves into deeper regional analy-&#13;
sis and key country developments. We estimate that our sample covers&#13;
70â&#128;&#147;80 percent of the microfinance PE activity in 2011.&#13;
    Section 2 looks at the valuation trends in the public market for LIFIs&#13;
in developing countries. This analysis includes banks that are not ex-&#13;
clusively offering microfinance but are also offering consumer loans&#13;
and other financial services. Since LIFIs serve similar markets to mi-&#13;
crofinance, their valuation can be a useful comparable for MFIs. This&#13;
report looks at the same 11 constituents of the LIFI Index that were&#13;
reviewed in the 2011 edition.&#13;
&#13;
   As evidenced by the percentage of loan portfolios where the loans are 30 days in ar-&#13;
1. &amp;#7;&#13;
   rears (known as portfolio-at-risk or PAR 30) for the average of 50 MFIs with signifi-&#13;
   cant foreign capital investments (as measured by Symbiotics SYM 50 index).&#13;
   For example, the average PAR 30 dropped from a high of 5.5% in early 2010 to its cur-&#13;
2. &amp;#7;&#13;
   rent level at 3.5%, as measured by Symbiotics SYM 50 index.&#13;

    Methodology and sources&#13;
&#13;
    The analysis in this paper is based on two original samples: (1) a private transac-&#13;
    tion data set that includes 68 transactions in 24 countries during 2011 and (2) a&#13;
    sample of 11 publicly traded LIFIs. We estimate that this sample of PE transac-&#13;
    tions represents 70â&#128;&#147;80 percent of the PE market. Combined with surveys from&#13;
    prior years, our sample now covers 302 transactions that occurred between&#13;
    January 2005 and December 2011, with an aggregate value close to US$1,057&#13;
    million. We believe this is the most comprehensive data set on PE investments&#13;
    in microfinance to date.&#13;
&#13;
    Private transaction data set&#13;
    This yearâ&#128;&#153;s data on PE transactions were collected and processed by CGAP in a&#13;
    strictly confidential survey conducted in the first quarter of 2012. Twenty-nine&#13;
    investors comprised of asset managers of microfinance investment vehicles&#13;
    (MIVs) and DFIs provided data on their PE transactions for 2011 (for a list of&#13;
    contributors see Appendix 1). During this survey cycle, covering Januaryâ&#128;&#147;&#13;
    December 2011, CGAP collected data on 84 individual transactions that&#13;
    amounted to US$382 million. However, only 68 transactions were included in&#13;
    our sample. Transactions were dropped if they were executed at nominal value&#13;
    where no valuation process could be assumed; were part of loans being con-&#13;
    verted into equity; were part of a preagreed investment stage, the price of&#13;
    which had been set during prior years; or were other deal types where valuation&#13;
    was not done during this cycle. Transactions that involved several parties that&#13;
    had done the valuation jointly are treated as one single transaction. This avoids&#13;
    a potential bias caused by including the same transaction information several&#13;
    times in the database.&#13;
        CGAP followed strict procedures to ensure full confidentiality of the data&#13;
    reported. These included confidentiality agreements with all survey participants&#13;
    and restricted access policies to the database. Only three CGAP staff and con-&#13;
    sultants had access to the underlying data. CGAP was responsible for quality&#13;
    control of the data and preliminary analysis. Only aggregated benchmarks were&#13;
    shared with J.P. Morganâ&#128;&#153;s team, and the team did not have access to the under-&#13;
    lying database.&#13;
&#13;
    Publicly traded LIFIs&#13;
    LIFIs are publicly traded commercial institutions that provide financial services&#13;
    to customers who overlap significantly with those of MFIsâ&#128;&#148;the lower income&#13;
    population in emerging markets. However, in many cases LIFIs do not necessar-&#13;
    ily have an explicit social agenda, and their loan portfolios tend to feature more&#13;
    consumer loans than microenterprise loans. The companies selected as LIFIs&#13;
    must meet the following conditions: (1) offer financial services; (2) serve the low-&#13;
    income segment; and (3) be listed on an exchange, with daily liquidity of at least&#13;
    US$0.1 million.&#13;

&amp;#12;     Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Overall, the microfinance PE market experienced stronger activity in&#13;
     2011, picking up from 2010, with an increase in the volume of transac-&#13;
     tions. However, some lingering effects of the crisis remain, and 2011&#13;
     saw the continued compression of valuation multiples for MFIs and&#13;
     LIFIs from the highs in 2009. We believe there is a wider convergence&#13;
     trend between the valuation of emerging market banks and microfi-&#13;
     nance providers, be it specialized MFIs or LIFIs.&#13;
        For 2012, we do not expect microfinance equity valuations to de-&#13;
     couple significantly from the valuation of emerging market banks. We&#13;
     expect valuations to be stable in most markets, with the exception of&#13;
     SSA and certain countries of LAC, which could see some increase in&#13;
     valuations.&#13;

            Volume growth and valuation contraction :
            global microfinance equity valuation survey 2012
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Toward the end of 2010, the asset
            quality of many microfinance institutions (MFIs) began to
            recover from a crisis of client over indebtedness and
            unsustainable growth, particularly in India, Bosnia, and
            Nicaragua.1 During 2011 and into 2012, this recovery
            continued to bring higher microfinance equity transaction
            volumes.2 Based on the responses gathered in this year&#146;s
            survey, the private equity (PE) markets experienced an
            important increase in deal activity from the slower pace
            recorded in 2010. Large transactions in Latin America and
            the Caribbean (LAC) as well as strong flows from development
            finance institutions (DFIs) in India drove the increase in
            both the volume and the number of transactions. While asset
            quality improved and transaction volumes increased, equity
            valuations continued to decline in 2011 from their peak in
            2010, reversing the multiple expansions that had taken place
            up until then. This is likely due to lingering uncertainties
            about asset quality in some markets and continued public
            scrutiny, which was most pronounced in a few countries
            making up a significant portion of our sample (and the
            market), such as India. In 2011, our comparables in the
            public market also declined with a drop in the average
            valuation of the Lower Income Finance Institutions (LIFIs)
            Index. We believe this reflects a wider trend where LIFI and
            microfinance valuations in the public and private markets
            are beginning to converge toward those of traditional
            financial institutions in emerging markets. Section 1 of
            this report examines the landscape of PE deals. It follows
            the methodology of previous surveys and discusses valuation
            trends and new market developments (see Box 1 for more
            details on this methodology). This section also delves into
            deeper regional analysis and key country developments. We
            estimate that our sample covers 70&#150;80 percent of the
            microfinance PE activity in 2011. Section 2 looks at the
            valuation trends in the public market for LIFIs in
            developing countries. This analysis includes banks that are
            not exclusively offering microfinance but are also offering
            consumer loans and other financial services. Since LIFIs
            serve similar markets to microfinance, their valuation can
            be a useful comparable for MFIs. This report looks at the
            same 11 constituents of the LIFI Index that were reviewed in
            the 2011 edition.
