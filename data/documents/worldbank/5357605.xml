                                          I. Background&#13;
&#13;
 1.      The DRC continues its recovery from decades o f mismanagement and collapse o f the&#13;
 State under the regime o f Mobutu Sese Seko culminating in a dreadful decade o f political&#13;
 instability and conflict involving groups from the entire Great Lakes region. The destruction and&#13;
 decay o f physical and social infrastructure caused by the conflict have contributed to a death toll&#13;
 between 1.5 and 3 million since 1997. Since January 2001, the Congolese authorities have taken&#13;
 a number o f important steps to implement the 1999 Lusaka Peace Accord and agreements&#13;
 reached through the inter-Congolese dialogue, to liberalize political life and to address key&#13;
 economic issues. A coalition government of transition is functioning and the country is on track&#13;
 for elections. A UNpeacekeeping force, the Mission d 'Observation des Nations Unies au Congo&#13;
 (MONUC) has been deployed throughout the country. While localized ethnic violence continues,&#13;
UNforces are beginningto stabilize even these specific districts. Just as the instability, conflict,&#13;
 and ungovemability o f the D R C had regional implications, the stabilization o f the D R C i s key to&#13;
 sustainable peace inthe region.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Inthis environment, the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy discussed bythe Board on&#13;
February 26, 2004, supports the government's far-reaching program o f economic reform in&#13;
preparation for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. It builds o n the achievements o f the&#13;
last two years to deepen support in social stability and security; shared economic growth,&#13;
including deepening o f ongoing economic reforms, reform o f the payroll system for public&#13;
servants, and reviving a competitive private sector; capacity and governance; and social&#13;
development. Proceeds o f the Credit, which is an integral part o f the TSS, have provided funds&#13;
necessary to support D R C reform efforts and have helped finance the economy's continued&#13;
stabilization, rehabilitation andreconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The Government's reforms o f economic governance have included fiscal stabilization&#13;
(now inits fourth year); liberalization o f prices, interest rates, foreign exchange and gem trading;&#13;
Central Bank, liquidation o f non-performing banks and restructuring o f the weakest remaining&#13;
ones coupled with banking and co-operative banking acts; steps to implement the new Codes for&#13;
Mining andForestry, and continued implementation of a broad set o f good governance and anti-&#13;
corruption policies. A program o f reform and privatization o f public enterprises i s underway,&#13;
together with tax and regulatory reforms designed to facilitate private sector growth and job-&#13;
creation. The Government continues to negotiate with its external creditors to lighten the&#13;
remaining burden o f debt service. Inaddition to supporting this ongoing program o f reforms, the&#13;
Credit addresses the settlement o f internal debts-to    private creditors and to public utilities with&#13;
services important to the poor-and      takes some extremely urgent initial steps which will permit&#13;
the restructuring o f the civil service.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                    11.    RECENTPOLITICAL AND SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
 4.      Progress continues in the process of peace, reunification and political reconciliation.&#13;
 The Congolese continue the important steps they began in 2001 to implement the 1999 Lusaka&#13;
 Peace Accord and agreements reached through the inter-Congolese dialogue, to liberalize&#13;
 political life and to address key economic issues. On October 1, 2004 (resolution 1565 (2004))&#13;
 the Security Council expanded the mandate United Nations Organization Mission in the Congo&#13;
 (MONUC) and authorized an increase in its troop strength to 16,700 (from 10,800). Its forces&#13;
 have been redeployed from their former observation posts throughout the country where peace&#13;
 has been firmly established to the remaining areas o f localized ethnic violence in the Northeast,&#13;
 and it i s beginning to stabilize even these regions. The effectiveness o f the reunification was&#13;
 marked in October 2004 by a visit by President Kabila to formerly-rebel held Kisangani.&#13;
 However, the brief seizures in late M a y o f the eastern city of Bukavu by ethnic militants, and in&#13;
 October o f a town in Katanga by an unknown armed group, demonstrates that the process i s&#13;
 incomplete.&#13;
&#13;
 5.     At the same time, the Demobilization, Repatriation, Resettlement and Reintegration&#13;
program, supported by the UN and IDA, has become operational and is beginning to help ex-&#13;
 combatants, including child soldiers, to reintegrate themselves into society, and the provision o f&#13;
assistance to child soldiers has already begun. The program i s supported by the Multi-country&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP) for the Great Lakes Region, which was&#13;
considered by the Executive Directors o f IDA on April 18, 2002 and financed by grants from&#13;
several countries and international organizations. The command structure o f the combined armed&#13;
forces has been reunified and regional military commanders have been appointed and taken their&#13;
posts throughout the country, though a small number of soldiers o f former rebel groups have&#13;
refused to join. The European Union (EU) in September 2004 launched a program to train a&#13;
national police force that respects human rights, with members also drawn from all o f the former&#13;
armed groups, and plans to expand this program to five centers nationwide. The long-term aim is&#13;
to train 9,000 police officers to lead a police force that can replace M O N U C by June 2005.&#13;
&#13;
6.      On the domestic front, the all-inclusive Government of national unity which took power&#13;
on June 30, 2003 with representation o f all key armed groups, unarmed opposition, and civil&#13;
society continues to demonstrate cooperation rather than conflict. The National Assembly is&#13;
applying strict standards of fiscal discipline to proposed legislation. Elections are scheduled by&#13;
June 2005, a calendar which the Special Representative o f the Secretary General calls tight but&#13;
tenable. On October 8 the government issued a "roadmap" defining, ina consensual manner, the&#13;
actions timing to be undertaken by each of the institutions of the Republic during the remaining&#13;
eight months o f the transition. The Parliament must pass about 15 essential laws as well as the&#13;
Constitution, all by December 2005.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The Government continues to implement satisfactorily an economic program that has&#13;
been supported since 2001 by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). The&#13;
economy grew at 3 percent in 2002 and 4 percent in 2003, reversing years o f decline.&#13;
Hyperinflation has been broken, with the price level rising at less than 5 percent in2003. Fiscal&#13;
revenues, which were only 5.1 percent o f a reduced GDP in 2000, reached 7.7 percent in 2003&#13;
and are targeted to reach 9.2 percent in2004. The debt burden is becoming less onerous as D R C&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 was granted debt relief on Naples terms by the Paris Club in September 2002, and reached the&#13;
 Decision Point under the enhancedH P C Initiative inJuly 2003.&#13;
&#13;
 8.      These developments point to the continued commitment o f all stakeholders to peace and&#13;
 the maintenance o f a viable process o f peaceful electoral transition, characterized by potentially&#13;
 credible institutions (including local and national administration, legislature, regulatory bodies,&#13;
 and civil society organizations providing outside oversight o f democratic governance and&#13;
 transparency), as well as the protection o f human rights and anticomption programs. They&#13;
 indicate a window o f opportunity for peace and recovery in the DRC and an opportunity for&#13;
peace in the entire Central African region. This opportunity calls for continued donor support as&#13;
 the country i s reunified, a national administration i s re-established in the formerly occupied&#13;
territories, and the country deals with the threat of continued localized violence as it prepares&#13;
peacefully for a new constitution and national elections.&#13;
&#13;
                             111.    RECENT    ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
9.       With respect to economic reform, the government's heavily front-loaded economic&#13;
reform program from June 2001 to March 2002, monitored by IMF staff, succeeded in&#13;
eliminating hyperinflation, liberalizing the economy and initiating major structural reforms. The&#13;
program under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), approved by the Executive&#13;
Directors o f the InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) on June 12, 2002 has also been satisfactorily&#13;
implemented, with the fourth review presented to the Fund's Board on July 12, 2004. A fifth&#13;
reviewmission is scheduled for November 2004.&#13;
&#13;
Performanceunder the PRGF-supportedProgram&#13;
&#13;
 10.     Through end-March 2004, overall performance under the program continued to be&#13;
satisfactory, with good progress on the structural front. Economic growth was higher than&#13;
envisaged, reaching 5.6 percent in2003, and inflation decelerated more rapidly than programmed&#13;
to less than five percent in2003.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Fiscal developments. The end-2003 fiscal objectives were missed by less than one&#13;
percent o f GDP. Fiscal performance at end-March 2004 differed slightly from the programmed&#13;
amounts on both the revenue (lower by 0.5 percent o f GDP, excluding grants) and the&#13;
expenditure (higher by 0.5 percent) side. The revenue shortfall reflecteddelays inthe adoption o f&#13;
legislative texts related to tariff and tax reform, the granting o f tax exemptions, and delays intax&#13;
payments. The programmed shift toward pro-poor spending was largely achieved (although the&#13;
2003 target itself was modest), while the share o f security expenditure (2.1 percent o f GDP) was&#13;
in line with program. Pro-poor spending was targeted to rise significantly in 2004, from 1.5&#13;
percent to 6.6 percent o f GDP (and from 11.7 percent to 34.3 percent o f government&#13;
expenditure). However, there is evidence that the administration has been unable to meet this&#13;
goal, partially because o f lack o f capacity to program and to spend expeditiouslythe anti-poverty&#13;
fund newly created under the terms o f the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, and because of slow&#13;
disbursementsbydonors.&#13;
&#13;
12.     On the external side, the current account balance, including grants and debt relief,&#13;
turned from a deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP in 2001 to a small surplus o f 0.6 percent o f GDP in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 2002, due to a strong growth o f exports and external grants and despite a sharp rise o f imports&#13;
 (including unofficial imports). Due to lower than expected disbursements o f project loan&#13;
 financing, the overall balance o f payments for 2003 was -US$348 million rather than the&#13;
 projected US$263 mission. In 2003 the gross foreign reserves o f the BCC increased by US$22&#13;
 million, and those o f commercial banks byUS$84 million.&#13;
&#13;
 13,     The foreign exchange market has functioned satisfactorily since the liberalization o f&#13;
 foreign exchange regulations in February 2001 and the unification o f the foreign exchange&#13;
 market inM a y 2001. The nominal exchange rate has been relatively stable compared to the U.S.&#13;
 dollar in 2003-4, although it appreciated significantly in early 2004 before returning to its end-&#13;
 2003 value (417 end-December 2003 vs. 420 end-September 2004). The real effective rate o f&#13;
 exchange depreciated by about 20 percent 2003-2004, reflecting the decline o f the US. dollar&#13;
 against the Euro.&#13;
&#13;
 14.     The Government continues to develop its full PRSP through a representative and&#13;
participatory process. With the allocation by the National Assembly o f US$600,000 as well as&#13;
 financing from several development partners, the funds necessary for these activities were largely&#13;
 assembled by July 2004; the work has been underway since October 2003 and the fieldwork&#13;
 since mid-2004. The full PRSP i s scheduledto be completed during the thirdquarter o f 2005.&#13;
&#13;
           Iv.      PROGRESSUNDERTHE PmRC FINANCEDADJUSTMENTPROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
A.      Overview&#13;
&#13;
 15.    The PRERC supports broad reforms in critical areas: (i) continued implementation o f&#13;
                                                                    the&#13;
economic reforms throughout the country; (ii)civil service reform, and in particular the&#13;
retirement o f staff having reached retirement age; and (iii)completing the process of debt&#13;
reduction and restructuring begun under the ERC, interms o f both settling arrears and preventing&#13;
the accumulation o f new arrears. Implementation is generally satisfactory. As described above,&#13;
the government has successfully maintained a macroeconomic policy framework for growth and&#13;
poverty reduction that i s consistent with the objectives of the reform program, one o f the&#13;
requirements for the tranche release. The remainder o f the present memorandum concentrates on&#13;
developments in re-establishing a satisfactory system o f payments for government consumption&#13;
o f public utilities, specifically electricity and water, companies for which the arrears o f their&#13;
largest client has a significant impact on their ability to deliver services to the private sector and&#13;
the poor. Details pertaining to the other aspects o f the program maybe found inthe Annex.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Reformof Utilities Billingand Centralized Payment&#13;
&#13;
16.     The reform o f public expenditure management and the establishment o f firm fiscal&#13;
controls are an important component o f the government's reform program, a component which i s&#13;
receiving extensive assistance from the IMF and from IDA. Early steps in this reform revealed&#13;
that continued significant underpayment o f amounts due to public utilities has had a significant&#13;
negative impact on both the electric company, the SocietC National d'Electricit6 (SNEL) and the&#13;
drinking water utility, RCgie des Eaux (RCgideso). For both these companies the government is&#13;
by far the largest customer, so its inability to pay more than a small fraction o f amounts due&#13;
causes significant harm to their receipts and their ability to serve other customers, including the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 poor. The Government's draft 2004 budget provides approximately US$21 million for water and&#13;
 electricity expenditures while the providers estimate the combined amount due to be about three&#13;
 times that amount, or U S $ 6 1 millionper year. Partly as a result o f the on-going accumulation o f&#13;
 arrears, utilities seek other means o f covering their expenses. These means include charging high&#13;
 rates to good clients, the business and industrial consumers o f electricity, or reducing expenses&#13;
 through lowering the quality o f service to the public (such as non-potable water or frequent&#13;
 electricity outages). Resolution o f the ongoing accumulation o f arrears by their largest client -&#13;
 the Government and its agencies-- can permit the utilities to improve their service to the public.&#13;
 While the problem exists for other utilities, the recently established mobile telephone companies&#13;
 have been able to avoid the problem by sticking strictly to a prepaid system o f access, and while&#13;
 it is significant for the accounts o f other utilities (fixed telephones, petroleum products), this has&#13;
 a lower overall cost to the economy.&#13;
&#13;
 17.     Reform o f the system, and resumption o f f i l l payments, has been hampered by the&#13;
 absence o f a viable billing process. Service points are diffuse, building by building throughout&#13;
the country, and some services (such as street lighting) are billed by sample methods rather than&#13;
by metering. Instead, many bills are based on pro forma estimates, established long ago and&#13;
unchanged despite changes in government consumption (either at the margin, or following the&#13;
loss o f entire units such as a closed office or an abandoned building). Services which could be&#13;
metered are not, for example most military bases.&#13;
&#13;
 18.     The utilities would be prepared to establish through audit, metering and other means, a&#13;
transparent dependable system for billing the government. However, the enormity o f the&#13;
investment would require that it yield an immediate return, which, even ifthey had the necessary&#13;
funding for the investment, would not happenunless the government were to resume payment on&#13;
the items now correctly billed.&#13;
&#13;
19.      The objectiveof the PRERCin reformof centralizedpaymentsis to strengthen public&#13;
expenditure management. It will free government resources for a transition o f notional payments&#13;
o f the government's bill for one year, in exchange for which the utilities-beginning            with the&#13;
water and electric utilities-will    establish a transparent billing system for the government, in&#13;
order that after one year a new billing system will be established and honored by the government.&#13;
The methodology established will permit the government to reform its billing and payments&#13;
systems with other utilities.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Impact of PRERC reforms.Assistance to the Government in reducing arrears should&#13;
hrther the Government's efforts to improve the management o f its utility service payment&#13;
obligations. The end o f many years o f continual accrual o f arrears will improve the management&#13;
process at public utilities. It will reduce bills to other consumers o f the utilities, and permit&#13;
increases in the quality o f service. It will also help the utilities strengthen their billing processes:&#13;
the Government i s requiring all suppliers henceforth to provide more accurate bills for services&#13;
rendered as a condition o f payment.&#13;
&#13;
         v.       CONDITIONS FORRELEASE OFTHE CENTRALIZEDPAYMENTSTRANCHE&#13;
&#13;
21.      The Development Credit Agreement states that two general conditions must be met at the&#13;
moment of the PRERC public utilities (centralized payments) tranche release: (i)        the Association&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 i s satisfied with the progress achieved by the Borrower in the carrying out o f the Program; and&#13;
 (ii) macroeconomic policyframeworkoftheBorrowerissatisfactory, asmeasuredonthe&#13;
      the&#13;
 basis of indicators agreed upon between the Borrower and the Association. Besides these, two&#13;
 specific conditions for the public utilities tranche releasemustbe met.&#13;
&#13;
 22.      Overall execution of the PRERC Program.Overall progress in implementation of the&#13;
 PRERC-financed program i s satisfactory and timely, and Government's commitment remains&#13;
 firm. Recommendation of IMF staff to its Board to complete the fourth review of the PRGF&#13;
program supports the evaluation that the macroeconomic policy framework and program&#13;
 execution are satisfactory. The indicators for the macroeconomic policy framework are given in&#13;
 the Government's Economic Program and are consistent with those o f the PRGF. These&#13;
indicators have been updated (in French, October 18) by the Ministry o f Finance's Technical&#13;
Committee for Monitoring Economic Reforms ("Matrice des Reformes Economiques," (Matrix&#13;
o f Economic Reforms)). The policy reforms are summarized inthe Annex o f this memorandum.&#13;
&#13;
23.       Specific conditionalitypertainingto centralizedpayments. The Borrower has met the&#13;
condition for the release o f the public utilities (centralized payments) floating tranche o f the&#13;
PRERC, which reads as follows: "[tlhe Borrower has furnished to the Association evidence in&#13;
form and substance satisfactory to the Association pursuant to paragraph 74 o f the Letter of&#13;
Development Policy, inter alia that: (1) an action plan, in form and substance satisfactory to the&#13;
Association, has been adopted and i s being carried out by the Borrower to control utility use and&#13;
related centralized payments; and (2) SNEL and RCgideso have begun to implement respective&#13;
action plans in form and substance satisfactory to the Association to improve the reliability, the&#13;
transparency and the accountability o f their respective billing procedures o f the Borrower's&#13;
public administration." The Borrower has adopted an action plan which details measures to be&#13;
implemented in order to control utility use.         These measures include redefining regulatory&#13;
framework, holding line ministries and local governments accountable for their utility use, and&#13;
revisingthe billingprocedure. The actions already taken by the Borrower include redefiningthe&#13;
regulatory framework and agreeing on the protocols with SNEL and RCgideso to improve the&#13;
billing procedure. SNEL andRCgideso have also adopted action plans that specify concrete steps&#13;
to achieve the stated goals: the SNEL action plan calls for an audit o f Government designated&#13;
distributionposts, establishing the identityo f the billable public sector client base, procuring and&#13;
installing new meters as necessary, and introducing a validated computerized monthly billing&#13;
system; the RCgideso action plan involves educating institutional clients in the purpose and&#13;
modalities o f the revisedsystem, identifyingdistributionpoints andprocuringhnstallingmeters at&#13;
key points, together with improving the water distribution system between these points and the&#13;
final user (to eliminate unmetered access), and monitoring and evaluation o fprogress andresults.&#13;
Actions already underway include establishing the audit o f distribution posts by SNEL and the&#13;
acquisitiono fmeters byResideso. Supporting documentation i s as follows:&#13;

Reunification Economic Recovery Credit have been met. Overall execution o f the program is&#13;
satisfactory. The macroeconomic framework i s consistent with the objectives o f the program and&#13;
execution i s satisfactory. The Government o f the Democratic Republic o f Congo has therefore&#13;
been advised that the Centralized Payments Floating Tranche, in an amount o f SDR 16.9million&#13;
is now available for disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              Annex&#13;
           Status of Executionof Letter of DevelopmentPolicy as of November2004&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  A-1.   Overall, execution o f policy measures contained in the Letter of Development Policy&#13;
 (LDP) has been satisfactory. Progress has beenmade indiverse areas such as preparation o f the&#13;
 full PRSP,demobilization and reinsertion of former combatants, civil service reforms, public&#13;
 expenditure management, forestry reforms, social sector and rural development, and&#13;
 infrastructure. A summary o f this progress i s outlined below according to the main areas o f the&#13;
 Letter of Development Policy: (A) poverty; (B) maintaining peace and improving govemance;&#13;
 (C) public enterprise reform; (D) natural resources management; (E) social sectors; (F)&#13;
 agriculture and rural development; and (G) infrastructure.&#13;
 A.      Poverty&#13;
  A-2.   The PRSP process continues on a revised schedule. The I-PRSP was completed on&#13;
 schedule inmid-2002. The actionplanand chronogram for the full PRSP were completed inJune&#13;
2003, and the workshop launching an information, education, communicationcampaign was held&#13;
in December 2003. Certain components of the process have been delayed by up to several&#13;
months, some due to financing problems, others due to adopting a more ambitious plan. The&#13;
Government expects to complete the first draft o f full PRSP by May 2005, and distribute it to&#13;
national and intemational development partners in July 2005, which represents a delay o f two&#13;
months from the original date. The adoption o f the PRSP i s still expected for August 2005. The&#13;
completion and a year o f satisfactory execution o f the full PRSP i s a HIPC completion point&#13;
trigger.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.       MaintainingPeaceand ImprovingGovernance&#13;
 A-3,    Security sector reform i s supported with the national Demobilization, Disarmament,&#13;
and Reinsertion (DDR) program, launched in December 2003. As targeted, the institutional&#13;
structure to steer and implement the national program was established and the DDR program&#13;
finalized in January 2004 after consultations and national dissemination. The disarmament and&#13;
demobilization phase has begun in April 2004, and the reinsertion and reintegration phase was&#13;
launched inNovember 2004.&#13;
 A-4. As concrete steps to fight against corruption, a decree on a Code o f Good Conduct for&#13;
Civil Servants, a law against money laundering and financing o fterrorism, and an anti-corruption&#13;
law were enacted.&#13;
A-5. There has been significant progress in public expenditure management under the&#13;
Government's program. The public expenditure classification has been revisedin conformity to&#13;
intemational standards. Modernization and streamlining o f public expenditure procedures were&#13;
achieved by September 2003, although scopes for improvement still remain. The progress made&#13;
allows the government to analyze its expenditures better, as well as to disseminate the budget&#13;
execution results for improved transparency. A poverty expenditure monitoring committee,&#13;
which verifies the progress made in combating poverty, was established in 2003. In 2004, the&#13;
government started to produce quarterly budget execution reports using the new economic,&#13;
administrative, and functional classifications.   The reports also present execution results o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 poverty-related and HIPC-financed expenditures. A double-entry accounting system i s expected&#13;
 to be adopted in2004-2005 (the last two points are HIPC completionpoint triggers).&#13;
  A-6.  Payroll reforms are also underway: the salary payment system was audited in the first&#13;
 trimester o f 2004; a new (transitional) payroll procedure i s expected to be implementedbefore&#13;
 April 2005; a central database o f civil servants will be created when the census results become&#13;
 available inNovember 2005 (slightlybehindschedule).&#13;
  A-7. Procurement reform began in April 2004 with a complete audit o f the current system,&#13;
 assisted by the World Bank in the form o f a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR).&#13;
 The elaboration and implementation o f a new procurement code and its principal application&#13;
 decrees, a HIPC completion point trigger, are planned for 2004 -2006.&#13;
 A-8.   Civil service reforms started with institutional audits o f selected ministries. A civil&#13;
 service census to support the reform has beenlaunched, albeit with some delay. The preparations&#13;
 for the civil servant retirement program are making progress: a consultant to provide technical&#13;
 assistance was recruitedto help the Government define a detailed strategy and actionplan for this&#13;
 program (this i s a tranche release condition for the civil service reform floating tranche of&#13;
 PRERC); a working group, formed by representatives from the Ministries o f Civil Service,&#13;
 Finance, Budget, and Interior, i s establishing the procedures for paying out the retirement&#13;
 packages. The efforts to allow the first group o f civil servants to retire have resumedinearnest to&#13;
 make up for some o f the delay caused by glitches in recruiting the consultant. Meanwhile, a&#13;
 survey of service delivery system for health, education, justice, and rural sectors, was conducted&#13;
 andthe draft report was issuedinOctober 2004.&#13;
 A-9. Decentralization i s an important responsibility placed on the transition government by&#13;
the peace accord. A draft law on territorial organization was prepared by the Government, ledby&#13;
the Ministry o f Interior, and has been submitted to Parliament. The World Bank supported a&#13;
parliamentary review o fthe draft-law inSeptember 2004.&#13;
 A-10. Judicial reform i s underway as indicated inthe LDP. A review o f the Congolesejudicial&#13;
system, planned for 2003, was completed in draft inFebruary 2004, with a broad EUdiagnostic&#13;
report presented inNovember 2004.&#13;
 A-11. Financial sector reform to modernizing and strengthening the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework i s being implemented with the support o f the IMF: new laws governing the Central&#13;
Bank, commercial banks, and savings institutions were enacted (2002); steps are taken to&#13;
strengthen the Central Bank as a financial institution as well as the monetary authority (ongoing);&#13;
commercial banks are being restructured beginning with the decision to liquidate 3 public&#13;
commercial banks in2003, followed by a review o f other banks.&#13;
 A-12. Private Sector Development has focused onjudicial reform, taxation, sxq'             3labor&#13;
regulations, administrative procedures affecting business, and reduction o f domestic debt. The&#13;
principal judicial reform has been the creation o f new investment and labor codes (2002),&#13;
publication o f a new mining code (2002) and its decrees o f application (2003), creation o f&#13;
commercial tribunals (2002), designation o f personnel to work at the commercial tribunals (2003&#13;
and ongoing), creation o f a national arbitration center (June 2003), establishment o f the&#13;
investment promotion agency (2002), and installment andoperationalization o f a Single Customs&#13;
Window at the Port o f Matadi (2003). Taxation has been improved by the publication o f new&#13;
customs tariffs (2002-2003), finalizing a new customs code (June 2004), suspension o f certain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  fiscal and parafiscal levies (2003), preparation o f an action plan to reform direct and indirect&#13;
  taxes (initial stages done; ongoing), andpreparation o f a global action plan for direct and indirect&#13;
  tax reform conceming firms (2004). The government has adopted some o f the main decrees to&#13;
  apply the new labor code during 2004. A comprehensive audit was undertaken in 2004 o f&#13;
 business-related administrative procedures. The government has also movedto reduce the weight&#13;
  o f domesticdebt on the business community: an action planwas prepared to resolve problems o f&#13;
  intemal debt based on the audit o f the government arrears to the private sector (first semester o f&#13;
  2004). The government is making progress, albeit slowly, on the next steps of certifying private&#13;
  sector's financial claims on the State, reconciling any discrepancies, negotiating the payment o f&#13;
  credits, and actually paying off the debt. An action plan to carry out these steps satisfactory to&#13;
 IDA, and adopted by government, is a condition for release of the "intemal debt" tranche of the&#13;
 PRERC.&#13;
   C.     PublicEnterpriseReform&#13;
   A-13. Public enterprise reform began in September 2001, followed by the creation o f a Public&#13;
 Enterprise Reform Commission (COPIREP) in 2002, and the nomination o f an executive&#13;
 secretary and two deputies in 2003. COPIREP delivered to the Government the accounting and&#13;
 operational audits o f certain enterprises (2003), formed sectoral working groups (2004), and&#13;
 conducting studies on process o f reforming public enterprises in key sectors (ongoing). The&#13;
 preparation o f action plans for reform o f public enterprises began in 2004 and is ongoing.&#13;
 During the current session (2004), Parliament will consider a new judicial and regulatory&#13;
 framework on public enterprises prepared bythe Government.&#13;
&#13;
 D.       NaturalResourcesManagement&#13;
  A-14. The reforms indicated in the LDP continue to be implemented in forestry and mining. In&#13;
 the forestry sector, a new code was adopted in 2002, and its application decrees are being&#13;
prepared. Based on the new code, a moratorium on new logging contracts was imposed, some o f&#13;
 the existing contracts not in line with the new code were cancelled (2002), and the list o f&#13;
 cancelled contracts was published. In addition, the new area tax i s being collected and Ministry&#13;
 o f Environment i s about to cancel non-compliant contracts, whereas Ministryo f Finance intends&#13;
to start transferring a share o f forestry revenues to local governments in order to encourage&#13;
 sustainable management o f forests. An economic review o f the sector was completed in 2003,&#13;
and the proposed fiscal reforms were adopted in March 2004. The implementation o f these&#13;
reforms were delayed until ONATRA became fully compliant in November 2004. Also during&#13;
2004, a new law on nature conservation was submitted to Parliament.&#13;
  A-15. In the mining sector, a new code was also adopted (2003), publicized, and distributed&#13;
nationwide (2004). The financial management o f the miningcadastre was to be restructured by&#13;
March 2004 but i s only now beginningto be done. An arbitration commission on validation o f&#13;
mining titles was created as planned in 2003, but was not judged sufficiently independent. The&#13;
cleanup o f mining titles will begin once this commission becomes operational. The restructuring&#13;
o f Gecamines has proceeded with a diagnostic audit leading to a presentation o f options for&#13;
restructuring, and the final report was submitted in November 2003. A voluntary departures&#13;
program for excess workers was completed in January 2004. The examination o f existing&#13;
agreements and preparation o f statutes o f a new company, to have beencompleted by June 2004,&#13;
i s ongoing: the restructuring strategy has been validated at the government level; a management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 contract is being negotiated with an international firm and should be signed by end December&#13;
 2004. Implementationwill begininearly 2005.&#13;
&#13;
 E.      Social sectors&#13;
  A-16. In health sector, the government made efforts to sign service contracts expeditiously&#13;
with execution agencies/NGOs              for  the Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and&#13;
Reconstruction Project (PMURR), in order to realize visible results in improving basic service&#13;
 delivery. The country health status report is expected to become available in the final form in&#13;
 December 2004. A sectoral strategy will be preparedby 2006, which will guide efforts to reform&#13;
 the regulatoryand budgetary framework o fthe sector (this i s a HIPC completionpoint trigger).&#13;
  A-17, The action plan for the "Education for All" program i s to be presented to the donor&#13;
 community in November 2004. The preliminary results of the country status report was&#13;
 disseminated broadly, and the final version was presentedin August 2004, as programmed. The&#13;
 first phase o f the rehabilitation o f education infrastructure i s on target. The Government believes&#13;
that the preparation o f a sectoral strategy will be completed by 2006, as targeted inthe LDP (this&#13;
i s a HIPC completionpoint trigger).&#13;
 A-18. A qualitative risk and vulnerability study was conducted in the area o f social&#13;
protection(2003). A global program for the sector was developed based on the completed&#13;
studies, andis now beingreviewed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
F.        Agriculture and Rural Development&#13;
 A-19, The target o f increasing output in agriculture has been addressed by a seed program&#13;
(begun in 2002 and in progress), rehabilitation of 850 hectare of irrigated land by 2005&#13;
(ongoing), and studies to improve aviculture, small livestock raising, fish farms, and local fishing&#13;
(launched in 2004 and in progress). Improvement in access to local markets through&#13;
rehabilitation o f 5000 km o f rural tracks started in 2004 and i s scheduled to last through June&#13;
2005. The first phase o f the program, supported under the PMURR, covers approximately 1200&#13;
km, and is scheduled to be completed in 2004. The introduction of an information system on&#13;
market prices for agricultural products i s underway. The Government i s developing a rural&#13;
strategy, which i s to be completed in 2006. The adoption o f this strategy is a HIPC completion&#13;
point trigger.&#13;
G.       Infrastructure (Roads, electricity, and water)&#13;
 A-20. On infrastructure, the LDP focuses on two main objectives: (i)rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance o f existing infrastructure and (ii)      legal and regulatory environment reforms. An&#13;
international firm was selected in 2002 end in late 2005. Other transportation infrastructure&#13;
works are about to start with a slight delay. In electricity, a study on the state o f SNEL&#13;
installations was completed inJuly 2004, and urgent works on rehabilitating production capacity&#13;
at 600 megawatts are to be conducted in 2005-2007. In water, works have started, and will&#13;
continue through 2006.&#13;
 A-21. Since 2003, new legal and regulatory frameworks for the petroleum, energy, andwater&#13;
sectors are beingprepared. The Ministry o f Energy began this work before COPIREP started to&#13;
supervise the activity, and the two institutions have now taken the work up together.to manage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the infrastructure components o f the PMURR, and technical design studies were launched in&#13;
2003. Road works are underway since 2004 and scheduled to last through 2006, following the&#13;
selection and mobilization o f contractors through international competitive bidding. In urban&#13;
infrastructure, the execution o f two important works (Kasa-Vubu urban rehabilitation and&#13;
Selembao erosion works) began in2004 and are expected to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              13&#13;

            Congo, Democratic Republic of - Post
            Reunification Economic Recovery Credit Project - release of
            the centralized payments tranche - full compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Post Reunification Economic Recovery
            Credit (PRERC) Project supports broad reforms in critical
            areas: a) the continued implementation of economic reforms
            throughout the country; b) civil service reform, and in
            particular the retirement of staff having reached retirement
            age; and, c) completing the process of debt reduction and
            restructuring, begun under the Economic recovery Project, in
            terms of both settling arrears, and preventing the
            accumulation of new arrears. Implementation is generally
            satisfactory. The objective of the PRERC in reform of
            centralized payments, is to strengthen public expenditure
            management, and the methodology established will permit the
            government to reform its billing, and payments systems with
            other utilities. The Development Credit Agreement states
            that two general conditions must be met at the time of
            meeting the PRERC public utilities (centralized payments)
            tranche release: 1) the Association is satisfied with the
            progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the
            Program; and, 2) the macroeconomic policy framework of the
            Borrower is satisfactory, as measured on the basis of
            indicators, agreed upon between the Borrower and the
            Association. Overall progress in implementation of the
            PRERC-financed program is satisfactory and timely, and
            Government's commitment remains firm. The Borrower has
            met the condition for the release of the public utilities
            (centralized payments) floating tranche of the PRERC. All
            conditions for the release of the Centralized Payments
            Tranche of the Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit
            have therefore been met. Overall execution of the program is
            satisfactory. The macroeconomic framework is consistent with
            the objectives of the program, and execution is
            satisfactory. The Government has therefore been advised that
            the Centralized Payments Floating Tranche, is now available
            for disbursement.
