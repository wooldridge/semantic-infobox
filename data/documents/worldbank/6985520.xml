MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ&#13;
EMERGENCY DISABILITIES PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
A.     BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
Country Background&#13;
1.    Abundant natural and human resources enabled Iraq to attain the status of a middle-income&#13;
country in the 1970s. The country developed good infrastructure and well-performing healthcare and&#13;
education systems, widely regarded as among the best in the Middle East. Income per capita rose to over&#13;
US$3,600 in the early 1980s. Since that time, successive wars and a repressive, state-dominated economic&#13;
system have stifled growth and development and debilitated basic infrastructure and social services.&#13;
International trade sanctions imposed in 1991 took a further toll on the economy.&#13;
2.     After hitting a low in the wake of the 2003 invasion, real GDP rose by about 47 percent in 2004,&#13;
reflecting strong oil prices and partial recovery of the oil sector. Per capita income, which was around&#13;
US$3,600 in the early 1980s, fell to US$770 by 2001, with a slight increase to US$940 in 2005 - only a&#13;
quarter of what Iraqis enjoyed twenty-five years ago. Although data remain unreliable, surveys suggest&#13;
that poverty has worsened in recent years, and unemployment is estimated to be at least 30 percent. The&#13;
Government continues to provide large untargeted subsidies for food, fuel, and utilities, amounting in&#13;
total to about 50 percent of GDP. Although the subsidies provide important support for the poor and&#13;
vulnerable, they distort markets, disproportionately benefit the wealthy, encourage black markets and&#13;
smuggling, and burden the budget, crowding out potentially more efficient spending on targeted social&#13;
programs.&#13;
3.     Real GDP growth is projected at about 2.6 percent in 2005, due to stagnating oil production and&#13;
exports. Growth is expected to accelerate to about 10 percent in 2006, predicated on increased security&#13;
and political stability, higher oil production and exports, and continued strong world oil prices. Strong&#13;
growth also depends on introducing targeted safety nets and implementing structural reforms-including&#13;
a gradual reduction in subsidies-to contain recurrent spending and allow for sufficient investment and&#13;
reconstruction. Iraq's overriding challenge, for both stability and economic sustainability, is to improve&#13;
the management and transparency of oil revenues.&#13;
Current Challenges&#13;
4.     Over the past year, Iraq has had two political transitions, taking steps toward a constitutionally-&#13;
elected government. Nevertheless, the country faces a violent insurgency that is impeding reconstruction&#13;
and economic recovery. The pressing and immediate challenges are to restore the rule of law, establish&#13;
political legitimacy, and begin to build credible and inclusive institutions. The ability of the Iraqi&#13;
Transitional Government to include ethnic and religious groups in the political process will be an&#13;
important factor in determining whether a future constitutionally-elected government will improve&#13;
security and stability, which are preconditions for successful reconstruction.  In October 2005, a&#13;
referendum was held on the new constitution. In December 2005, national elections for the establishment&#13;
of a new government were held.&#13;
5.     Persistent violence has affected most parts of the country, and continues to hinder reconstruction&#13;
efforts, economic recovery, and institutional reform. The instability has hindered the delivery of basic&#13;
services to the population by slowing reconstruction efforts, impeding private investment, and adding&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
significantly to security costs. Most services have not returned to their pre-2003 levels, and regional&#13;
disparities continue.&#13;
Disabilities and the Health Sector&#13;
6.     The ongoing violence, large number of war veterans from recent conflicts, and the breakdown of&#13;
community support systems with limited access to health and rehabilitation services are having a&#13;
devastating effect on persons with disabilities (PWD) in Iraq, and increasing the already high burden of&#13;
disease. The burden imposed on Iraqi society by disabilities is huge. Given the high unemployment rates&#13;
and poor community services, becoming disabled poses a serious risk for the entire family to slip into&#13;
poverty. Incomes foregone by PWD are compounded by the opportunity cost to the family caregiver who&#13;
might otherwise be participating in the labor force. When disability affects the head of a household, the&#13;
impact on a family's welfare can be devastating. In many cases, women in families with PWD, in&#13;
addition to caring for the family, including the disabled family member, face the additional burden of&#13;
providing an income for the household and dealing with the social stress that often results from shifting&#13;
gender roles in the household. This double burden takes a serious toll on women. Children in families&#13;
with PWD are also less likely to attend school or have higher drop-out rates.&#13;
7.     Persons with Disabilities. Disabled persons in Iraq represent a distinctly underserved and&#13;
growing segment of the population. The past two decades of consecutive wars and associated violence&#13;
have resulted in an ever increasing number of war-related injuries and disabilities among the population.&#13;
Although current data are not reliable, the on-going conflict continues to exert a heavy toll on the&#13;
population, and the cumulative number of persons suffering from physical disabilities (excluding&#13;
blindness, deafness, and disabilities resulting from chronic diseases) is estimated at 250,000. Within this,&#13;
the number of amputees was 80,000 to 100,000 in 2002, with 80 percent from lower limb amputations&#13;
and the number of people suffering from spinal cord damage was 8,000. It is estimated that 70 percent of&#13;
disabled people are male, and 30 percent are female. The specific burden on children is as yet unknown.&#13;
8.    Key issues for disabled persons include the following:&#13;
9.     Poverty and lack of social services have emerged as significant issues over the past two&#13;
decades. In 1980, Iraq's income, education, and health measures were high compared to regional&#13;
averages. However, in the intervening years, the situation reversed itself. It is estimated that at least two&#13;
million people are unemployed - about 30 percent of the total workforce - and underemployment is also&#13;
high. At the same time, due largely to the conflicts and mismanagement of resources, social sector&#13;
services have declined steadily, in terms of quality of care and resource allocations. This has had the&#13;
greatest impact on those groups which are the most vulnerable, including PWD.&#13;
10.   Once considered one of the best in the region, the Iraqi health system has declined&#13;
significantly over the past two decades. During the 1980s, Iraq's health sector consisted of a highly&#13;
advanced curative system, with minimal focus on public health. During the 1990s, funds available for&#13;
health were reduced by 90 percent and health outcomes became among the poorest in the region, and well&#13;
below levels found in countries of comparable income. According to the 2003 UNICEF/WHO Health and&#13;
Nutrition Watching Brief, Iraq has the region's second highest infant mortality (83/1,000 live births in&#13;
2002) and under-five mortality rates (117/1,000 in 2001), a stark reversal from the improvements in these&#13;
areas in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During the 1990s, maternal mortality grew three-fold, with about&#13;
30 percent of women giving birth without a qualified health worker in attendance. Adult mortality&#13;
increased and life expectancy fell to under 60 years for men and women by 2000. This is within the&#13;
context of an expanding population which has doubled in the past 25 years. The population now stands at&#13;
27.1 million and is growing at about three percent per year. Over this same period, there has been a&#13;
serious decline in accessibility and quality of health services. Significant budget cuts, coupled with poor&#13;
management, neglect, and looting due to recent conflicts, have resulted in deteriorating health services&#13;
infrastructure. Training opportunities for health professionals also suffered during this period, and as a&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
result, health professionals became isolated from the outside world, and were not able to keep up with&#13;
advances in the field of medicine. Many in fact chose to leave the country.&#13;
11.    Care of disabled people has deteriorated significantly over the past two decades as a result&#13;
of conflicts and mismanagement. The breakdown of community support systems and the limited access&#13;
to health services and rehabilitation services have had a devastating effect on PWD. The Government's&#13;
difficulties in providing basic health services have had a particularly negative impact on recent victims of&#13;
acts of violence. Complications from injuries are common and can result in severe additional disabilities&#13;
due to lack of appropriate treatment. The capacity of the Government to provide treatment to the victims&#13;
of war and other violent acts is limited; many complications occur and reconstructive surgery is almost&#13;
impossible. In the current context, the Government has the double burden of providing adequate care to&#13;
the recent victims of violence, as well as maintaining care of those whose disabilities are not related to the&#13;
recent and on-going conflicts.&#13;
12.    Existing centers dedicated to the rehabilitation of disabled patients and the manufacture of&#13;
prosthetic limbs have been looted and most of the facilities have suffered heavy physical damage in recent&#13;
years. There are currently 12 rehabilitation centers in Iraq, and 12 prosthesis workshops, including four&#13;
in the Kurdistan region, most of which have suffered damage since May 2003. Several workshops are&#13;
operated with the assistance of international NGOs such as Handicap International and the International&#13;
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), but in most facilities, equipment is obsolete, and medical supplies&#13;
and raw materials are insufficient. Moreover, it must be noted that the technology has dramatically&#13;
evolved during recent years, and once the centers are rehabilitated, new equipment reflecting updated&#13;
technology will need to be provided and the staff retrained.&#13;
13.    There are also three hospitals for spinal injuries (located in Baghdad and Salah-il-Deen), as well&#13;
as one former army hospital that provides special care for disabled persons. The existing capacity in-&#13;
country for the manufacture of artificial limbs could reach 5,000 per year if raw materials were available.&#13;
This is far below the annual requirement of 20,000 protheses.&#13;
14.   In addition to the services provided through the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Ministry of Labor&#13;
and Social Affairs (MOLSA) provides welfare services, as well as some equipment and vocational&#13;
training, to PWD and their families. The MOLSA operates several specialized institutes for the&#13;
physically handicapped, the deaf, the blind, and the mentally disabled. It employs most of the social&#13;
workers in Iraq and was traditionally responsible for the social protection systems put in place in the&#13;
1 980s. It is not apparent that close coordination of activities for disabled people exists between the MOH,&#13;
MOLSA and other ministries and agencies providing disability services, especially in the absence of a&#13;
coherent national policy on disabilities. For these reasons, participation of the MOLSA in preparation of&#13;
the Project has been necessary in order to avoid duplication and ensure optimal coordination with the&#13;
MOH.&#13;
15.    There has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder&#13;
(PTSD) as a result of the recent conflict. Poverty, instability, and the recent conflict have also taken a&#13;
toll on the mental health of the population. It is difficult to assess the extent of the mental health burden in&#13;
Iraq, but research under the recent Bank-financed Post-conflict Mental Health Project in Bosnia showed&#13;
that in post-conflict societies, mental disorders are widespread and represent a major obstacle to economic&#13;
development. Poor mental health also reduces job opportunities for affected individuals and stands in the&#13;
way of development of human and social capital.&#13;
16.    Given the breadth of the needs in the disabilities area and the limited resources and timeframe,&#13;
this Project will not focus directly on mental health and depression, although these dimensions of&#13;
disability will be taken into account in the development of the national framework on disabilities.&#13;
Addressing the needs of people with these disabilities will also require stabilization of the general security&#13;
situation, personal safety and job security, strong community support and social support as well as the&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
restoration of adequate health and rehabilitation services. However, the Bank is actively seeking donors&#13;
to provide parallel support in this area and is also exploring options for supporting these activities with&#13;
future IDA financing.&#13;
17.    Many NGOs are now operating in Iraq to help disabled people, but most lack resources and&#13;
capacity. Establishment of NGOs, except in the northern part of the country where NGOs have been&#13;
active for a few years, has begun only recently in Iraq. Around 6,000 NGOs have been created in Iraq&#13;
within the past two years which poses a major coordination challenge. Many of these NGOs are very&#13;
small, lacking in resources, and poorly organized. In addition, the scope of their activities is not well-&#13;
defined. Without support, the newly established NGOs working on different aspects of disability have&#13;
very limited capacity to be effective partners in addressing the needs of disabled people. Partnership with&#13;
NGOs operating at the community and regional levels presents an opportunity for addressing disabilities&#13;
issues more efficiently and effectively. Also, given the limited experience of the Government in working&#13;
with NGOs, both the Government and the NGO sectors will have to invest substantial efforts to learn to&#13;
work as effective partners in the future, respecting differences in approach and the comparative&#13;
advantages of each sector. The commitment of the Government to work with the NGO sector in the area&#13;
of disabilities was re-confirmed during the appraisal mission.&#13;
18.    The inter-ministerial oversight commission for disabilities has been proposed but not yet&#13;
formally established under the new Government. Before the 2003 war, a special commission&#13;
established by the armed forces was responsible for the care of PWD. When this commission was&#13;
abolished and the facilities operated by the army were transferred to MOH authority, the responsibilities&#13;
for the care of PWD became unclear. Through the leadership of the Directorate of Medical Operations&#13;
and Specialized Services of the MOH, a commission - the Iraqi Commission for the Disabled - to be&#13;
attached to the Council of Ministers, was being considered by in interim Government in 2004. Members&#13;
of the Board of Directors were to include representatives from eight ministries, representatives of&#13;
community groups, and representatives of disabled persons. This commission, however, has not yet been&#13;
formally established under the new Government.&#13;
Government Strategy and Donor Involvement&#13;
19.    National Development StrateMv. In July 2005, the Iraqi Transitional Government presented a&#13;
National Development Strategy (NDS) aimed at placing Iraq on a course toward a diversified market-&#13;
based economy. The strategy focuses on good governance, private sector-led growth, and strong social&#13;
safety nets. The four pillars of the NDS are: (i) strengthening the foundations of economic growth; (ii)&#13;
revitalizing the private sector; (iii) improving the quality of life through, among other things, investing in&#13;
the social sectors; and (iv) strengthening good governance and improving security. The NDS gives&#13;
priority in the short term to restoring basic services and creating employment. Although donors pledged&#13;
US$32 billion at the International Conference for Iraq in Madrid in October 2003, continued lack of&#13;
security has complicated delivery of donor assistance and lessened its impact on the ground. At the recent&#13;
Iraq International Conference in Brussels in June 2005, donors were urged to find ways to expedite&#13;
project implementation and, if necessary, to re-allocate funds to faster disbursing activities. Donors have&#13;
deposited about US$1 billion in the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI), which&#13;
consists of two trust funds, one administered by the World Bank and another by the United Nations.&#13;
Nearly all donor deposits to IRFFI have been allocated to projects that are ongoing. takes the form of&#13;
bilateral assistance, mainly from the United States. Japan is the second largest donor.&#13;
20.    Government Strate2v for Disabled Persons. The Iraq Transitional Government placed high&#13;
priority on improving its services to support rehabilitation of disabled persons, and their re-entry into&#13;
productive life. Initiating its response to the above-mentioned challenges, in 2004, the Iraqi Interim&#13;
Government prepared a strategy document outlining the underlying principles for development of a plan&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for the recovery of the country's health sector.' The overall objective of the short to medium term&#13;
strategy is to improve access to and quality of health services for the population of Iraq. The key&#13;
challenges identified in the strategy include: (i) meeting the most urgent needs of the sector, including&#13;
rebuilding the health services infrastructure and the human resource capacity of the sector; (ii)&#13;
strengthening management of the health system; (iii) re-organizing the pharmaceutical sector and&#13;
providing for an efficient drug-supply chain; (iv) reducing health risks in the population; and (v) tackling&#13;
the causes for the recent rise in communicable and non-communicable diseases.&#13;
21.    Within these broad areas, a reform of the physical and psycho-social rehabilitation services is&#13;
recognized as one of the priority areas of the MOH. In November 2004, the MOH prepared a draft&#13;
national strategy for the physically disabled which includes an outline of planned interventions to improve&#13;
the quality of and access to care for people with disabilities.2 Main areas of the plan were identified as:&#13;
medical rehabilitation of individuals who have suffered serious physical injuries; and psychological&#13;
rehabilitation of both the individual and the community involved.&#13;
22.    In this context, the MOH has developed a broad framework for care of disabled people, with&#13;
realistic targets to be achieved within the next five years. The Project, which would meet only a very&#13;
small portion of the real needs in the area of medical rehabilitation, could be followed by a more&#13;
comprehensive project, provided sufficient resources and donor partnerships and support are available,&#13;
and the security context in the country has improved.&#13;
23.    Donor Involvement. The MOH, in a recent review of donor support, estimates that donor&#13;
support to the health sector, totaling about US$1 billion, is committed from four main international&#13;
donors, i.e., the United States (including the Iraq Reconstruction Management Office, the Department of&#13;
Defense Iraq Projects and Contracting Office, and USAID), the United Nations (UN) agencies (including&#13;
WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA), the World Bank, and the Government of Japan. In addition, many other&#13;
countries have contributed to the effort through the UN and World Bank Trust Funds. The leading donor&#13;
is the United States with its Supplemental Aid commitment totaling about US$800 million, to support&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation and construction (selected hospitals and primary health care centers),&#13;
equipment, and technical assistance and training for health care workers and MOH management and&#13;
administration staff. The UN agencies are committed to providing about US$70 million in assistance,&#13;
primarily to selected hospital emergency wards, National Drug Control Laboratory, ambulances,&#13;
equipment and supplies, and training programs. WHO support is focused on a non-communicable&#13;
diseases and mental health program as well as on Primary Care and micronutrient deficiencies. The&#13;
Government of Japan, which is contributing direct assistance to the health sector in the amount of&#13;
approximately US$600 million, is supporting rehabilitation of 13 hospitals in southern Iraq; provision of&#13;
ambulances; and medical equipment for selected hospitals and primary health care centers. Some&#13;
countries, like the Gulf States, have provided bilateral assistance, and the Multinational Forces and a&#13;
number of NGOs have given support. A table showing current and planned international donor health&#13;
activities in Iraq can be found in Annex 10.&#13;
24.    Most of the recovery support to the health sector - about US$650 million - is going towards&#13;
improving the infrastructure. About US$260 million is being provided for equipment; and for training&#13;
and technical assistance, about US$1.0 million is available. The substantial investment in buildings and&#13;
equipment reflected above is a rational priority for the Iraqi Government, given the years of neglect and&#13;
deterioration of basic infrastructure and services.&#13;
25.    Although the total amount of funding committed by the donors to Iraq's overall reconstruction&#13;
program is very large, the security situation on the ground in Iraq is significantly impeding progress in&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
implementing the various donor programs. Recovery of the health sector requires stability and security,&#13;
and the current violence has created an environment where donors and NGOs cannot freely operate and&#13;
provide direct support to the recovery program.&#13;
B.     BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
26.    The World Bank Second Interim Strategy Note for Iraq was presented to the Bank's Board of&#13;
Executive Directors in September 2005. The strategy builds on the achievements of the First Interim&#13;
Strategy Note, and is aligned with the Iraqi Transitional Government's National Development Strategy.&#13;
The Bank's overarching objective is to help Iraq build efficient, inclusive, transparent, and accountable&#13;
institutions as needed for stability, good governance, and sustainable economic prosperity. Better&#13;
institutional frameworks, policies, and systems will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of both&#13;
national expenditures and international aid. Under the umbrella of institution building, the Bank Group's&#13;
work program is organized into four pillars, supporting government efforts to: (i) restore basic service&#13;
delivery; (ii) enable private sector development; -(iii) strengthen social safety nets; and (iv) improve public&#13;
sector govemance.&#13;
27.    The strategy relies on the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) and IDA to finance projects, and on&#13;
the World Bank budget for the economic and sector work and policy advice that is needed. The ITF has&#13;
about US$370 million to cover nine projects which are currently under implementation. The IDA&#13;
resources that are now available to Iraq amount to US$500 million which are allocated to four selected&#13;
sectors: water and sanitation, transportation (roads), power, and education. The first IDA project - the&#13;
Third Emergency Education Project - was approved by the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors&#13;
on November 29, 2005. The Bank strategy also includes building blocks of analytical work to support the&#13;
transition to a diversified market economy and the development of a social protection system. Analytical&#13;
work has been grouped into three clusters: economic reform and transition, public sector management,&#13;
and poverty and safety nets; and two sectors: health and education. A multi-sectoral institutional capacity&#13;
building program is ongoing.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
28.    The World Bank has already begun to focus on supporting the recovery of the health system in&#13;
Iraq. The first project - the Emergency Health Rehabilitation Project (EHRP) financed through the ITF -&#13;
aims to improve access to quality emergency services in selected health facilities to serve the urgent needs&#13;
of the Iraqi population. This objective is being carried out through rehabilitation and equipping of&#13;
selected emergency services units throughout the country, provision of emergency pharmaceuticals to&#13;
these units, and strengthening of the planning and management capacity of the central and provincial&#13;
health administrations.&#13;
29.    The MOH approached the Bank in October 2004 concerning support to PWD resulting from the&#13;
war and related accidents. This is an area which has obvious and direct links to the recent conflict and&#13;
which can unambiguously be considered as an urgent priority for the Government, especially considering&#13;
the continuous increase in the number of victims as a result of the. current instability and violence.&#13;
Improving the rehabilitation of the physically disabled can have an immediate and visible impact. The&#13;
rehabilitation will, in particular, include disabled ex-combatants who are unlikely to be reintegrated into a&#13;
community if they do not acquire some physical capabilities making it possible for them to re-enter the&#13;
workforce. This area has not yet been specifically addressed by the donor community, and the&#13;
Government has recently signaled that this is an urgent priority. The proposed project is consistent with&#13;
the objectives of the Bank's Human Development Strategy for Iraq, including helping to stem the&#13;
deterioration of health services, in terms of infrastructure, human resources, and management, and builds&#13;
logically on the support being provided through the EHRP to restore key services to the most vulnerable&#13;
in the society. It is also in line with the World Bank Middle East and North Africa Department's current&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
efforts to develop a strategy to support disabled people as a group disproportionately represented among&#13;
the world's poorest.3&#13;
30.    The Bank has extensive global experience in supporting these types of interventions in post-&#13;
conflict and emergency contexts. The Bank's priority is not only to provide immediate assistance in areas&#13;
of particular need, but also to ensure that sector development takes place through establishment of a&#13;
sound policy framework that will provide the basis for sustainability and for further reform measures. In&#13;
addition, decision-makers in Iraq will have the benefit of the Bank's understanding of global good&#13;
practices in supporting equity, quality, access and accountability in health system reform.&#13;
31.    Lessons from Post-Conflict Experience. Based on the World Bank's experience with the ongoing&#13;
EHRP and recent experiences both in Iraq and in post-conflict countries such as Afghanistan, East Timor,&#13;
Bosnia, Algeria, Sierra Leone and Kosovo, a number of important lessons have been learned and&#13;
introduced into the design of the proposed project. Below are key lessons learned:&#13;
*  For emergency recovery projects, a simple project design that can be quickly and visibly&#13;
implemented is most effective.&#13;
*  Close guidance and support to the counterparts implementing the project is essential, given&#13;
the lack of familiarity with international practices and low level of implementation capacity.&#13;
*  The project should be part of a programmatic framework based on a needs assessment of the&#13;
sector and close collaboration with other key donors.&#13;
*  Support to emergency priorities should be coupled with capacity building for the&#13;
implementing institutions and entities in order to improve their ability to implement current&#13;
and consecutive programs.&#13;
*  In contexts where direct Bank supervision is not possible, adequate training should be&#13;
provided to local representatives to carry out oversight of the project activities.&#13;
*  In post-conflict situations where there are numerous donor agencies involved, support should&#13;
be provided to the MOH in establishing an effective coordinating mechanism. This support&#13;
could be in the form of technical assistance and training in setting up the mechanism within&#13;
the framework of the project, as well as through "informal" technical advice from the Bank&#13;
team itself to the relevant MOH counterparts. In addition, the Bank needs to maintain good&#13;
and frequent collaboration with development partners.&#13;
C.     DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
32.    The overall objective of the Project is to support the delivery of improved rehabilitation and&#13;
prosthetic services that reduce the burden of physical disability. Specifically, the Project will: (i) support&#13;
the development of a national policy on disabilities; (ii) increase the capacity of Iraqi institutions and&#13;
other stakeholders to meet the needs of disabled persons; (iii) strengthen the partnerships between the&#13;
Government and civil society in provision of services to disabled persons; and (iv) upgrade the&#13;
infrastructure and equipment of selected rehabilitation and prosthetic centers throughout Iraq.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
33.    There will be three project components, namely: (i) Policy Development and Partnerships; (ii)&#13;
Delivery of Services to Disabled Persons; and (iii) Project Management.&#13;
3"A Note on Disability Issues in MENA Region", MNSHD working paper, April 2005.&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Component 1: Policy Development and Partnerships (US$0.8 million total, including contingencies)&#13;
34.    The objectives of this component are to: (i) develop a comprehensive policy and legislative&#13;
framework for disabilities; and (ii) initiate an enabling environment for development of partnerships&#13;
between the MOH, other ministries, and civil society in the area of disabilities.&#13;
35.    Policy Development. The Project will support the establishment of a multi-sectoral Disability&#13;
Working Group (DWG) as a first step in the policy development process. Technical assistance will be&#13;
provided under the Project to assist in organizing the DWG and preparing its work program. The&#13;
technical assistance will also support the preparation of a draft national policy framework on disabilities,&#13;
to be presented to the Prime Minister's Office and the National Assembly for review and adoption.&#13;
36.    This policy framework will encompass the medical aspects of the rehabilitation process, and will&#13;
take into account the following aspects of disability in Iraq: prevalence and main causes of disability,&#13;
economic and social consequences of disabilities, prevention and risk mitigation mechanisms, and&#13;
policies and strategies to create the enabling environment which permits PWD full participation in&#13;
society, including access to education and the labor force, and participation in decision making. It will&#13;
take stock of current knowledge of disability issues in the country, and open the door to new ideas and&#13;
initiatives that will help mainstream disability as a theme across sectors.&#13;
37.    Partnerships. The Project will support data collection and assessment of existing NGOs in the&#13;
area of disabilities in Iraq, as a basis for understanding what kinds of services the NGOs are currently&#13;
providing throughout the country. To begin building partnerships between NGOs and Government, the&#13;
Project will also finance a series of conferences/workshops for NGOs and Government officials at an&#13;
early stage of project implementation. These meetings will provide a forum for exchanging information&#13;
on ongoing strategies and activities for disabled people, and identifying areas of potential cooperation.&#13;
The workshops will also be an opportunity to learn more about the current capabilities and resources of&#13;
the NGOs operating in the field. The Project will also support a public awareness campaign to sensitize&#13;
the public about the needs of disabled people.&#13;
38.   In addition, the Project will provide support, on a limited pilot basis (not to exceed US$50,000 in&#13;
total), to the MOH to contract NGOs for provision of a selected number of specific services, e.g., assisting&#13;
with registration of disabled persons, distribution of wheelchairs, and community-based surveys.&#13;
Component 2: Delivery of Services to Disabled Persons (US$18.0 million total, including contingencies)&#13;
39.    The objective of this component is to improve the delivery of community-oriented rehabilitation&#13;
and prosthetic services for disabled persons in selected sites throughout the country. The approach is in&#13;
line with international best practice and with WHO recommendations for the development of community-&#13;
oriented services for the disabled, and represents a change in direction from the current unsustainable and&#13;
discriminatory practice in Iraq where rehabilitation, isolation in specialized institutions and primary&#13;
health care services are provided in large institutions, separate from services for the general population.&#13;
The new approach promotes provision of services in the community, increasing access and efficiency as&#13;
well as promoting an inclusive environment. If positive results are achieved during this Project, the next&#13;
phase would include establishment of a network of additional small community-oriented rehabilitation&#13;
centers, and further strengthening of the production workshops.&#13;
40.    The Project will support the construction of six new basic rehabilitation centers, and three new&#13;
rehabilitation centers with prosthetic workshops. In addition, five existing rehabilitation centers will be&#13;
renovated. Another four existing rehabilitation centers are in satisfactory condition and therefore will&#13;
benefit only from training and limited equipment, while the others will receive support in civil works&#13;
renovation, equipment and training. A table showing the details by rehabilitation center/workshop is in&#13;
Annex 8A.&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41.    The Project will support procurement of specialized equipment and materials for prosthetic&#13;
workshops, equipment for rehabilitation centers, computer workstations for management and registration&#13;
of beneficiaries, and office equipment and furniture for the selected locations. The Project will also&#13;
support procurement of medical aids, such as wheelchairs and walking aids. A table indicating the&#13;
comprehensive list of these goods is in Annex 8B.&#13;
42.    The Project will support training activities to improve the services for physical rehabilitation,&#13;
including: (i) specialized training for production and fitting of prostheses; (ii) training for&#13;
physiotherapists; (iii) management training for workshop and rehabilitation center managers; and (iv)&#13;
specialized training in physical therapy for hospital-based physicians. Training for technicians in the&#13;
prosthetics workshops will be linked to the procurement of equipment, and any tenders for equipment&#13;
would include the relevant training. Training of trainers for staff in existing facilities will be organized in&#13;
appropriate centers in neighboring countries. In addition, the Project will support the training of new&#13;
physiotherapists to be employed in the new centers.&#13;
Component 3: Project Management (US$0.7 million total, including contingencies)&#13;
43.    The objective of this component is to ensure effective administration and coordination of the&#13;
project activities. Overall project coordination will be carried out by a Project Management Team (PMT)&#13;
in the MOH. The lead implementing agency for the Project will be the MOH. Responsibility for&#13;
implementation of the components will rest with the relevant departments of the MOH and other agencies&#13;
involved in the project. The PMT will build on the capacities already established under the ongoing&#13;
Emergency Health Rehabilitation Project (EHRP), sharing a Director and the "business office" functions,&#13;
e.g., procurement, financial, and secretarial/logistical. One PMT Director will be responsible for both&#13;
EHRP and EDP. Likewise, the Technical Coordinator will be shared by the two projects and will report&#13;
directly to the PMT Director. Terms of Reference for this position will include day-to-day management&#13;
of the Project. An Assistant Technical Coordinator will be selected solely for the EDP, and this&#13;
individual's responsibilities will involve supporting the Technical Coordinator and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of the Project. Procurement, financial management and administrative staff of the PMT will&#13;
be increased to absorb the additional work of the EDP. The DWG will play an advisory role on policy&#13;
issues relating to the Project.&#13;
44.    The Project will finance: (i) adequate office equipment and supplies, and one project vehicle; (ii)&#13;
technical assistance and training for PMT staff in project management, procurement and financial&#13;
management; (iii) annual external audits of the project; and (iv) operating costs for the PMT, including&#13;
vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance, communications costs, banking fees, transportation&#13;
costs, meeting expenses, advertisement fees, representation, and office security arrangements.&#13;
D.     INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
45.    This section describes in detail the implementation of the EDP, which will provide urgent support&#13;
in the areas described above.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
46.    This Project is the second in the health sector to be financed from the ITF. The Ministry of&#13;
Planning and Development Cooperation (MOPDC) is the Government's designated donor coordination&#13;
agency for Iraq's reconstruction program. The MOH will be the implementing agency for the Project.&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47.    The PMT in the MOH, which is also the implementing agency for the EHRP, will be expanded to&#13;
coordinate and manage the EDP. The PMT will have the responsibility for the day-to-day management,&#13;
coordination and monitoring of the Project activities. The management structure for the Project is&#13;
reflected in Annex 3.&#13;
48.    Specifically, the PMT will: (i) coordinate project implementation, and manage the resources of&#13;
the project; (ii) procure all Grant-financed goods and services under the Project; (iii) operate the financial&#13;
management system according to World Bank requirements; (iv) act as liaison between the technical&#13;
agencies involved in the Project and the World Bank; and (v) carry out, on an annual basis, an&#13;
independent audit of the project. Specifically, in its management capacity, the PMT will ensure that: (a)&#13;
the project activities are well-coordinated; (b) issues affecting or potentially affecting project&#13;
implementation are identified and addressed in a timely manner; (c) technical advice is provided to&#13;
relevant MOH staff in how to develop work plans, write terms of reference, and effectively manage&#13;
consultant services; (d) safeguard issues are addressed in compliance with the Environmental and Social&#13;
Assessment Framework (ESSAF); (e) necessary project inputs are provided in a timely and cost-effective&#13;
manner; (f) project resources are appropriately managed in accordance with Bank requirements for&#13;
procurement and financial management; (g) effective project monitoring and progress reporting are&#13;
carried out; (h) there is a systematic outreach to various stakeholders to promote project objectives; and&#13;
(i) provide secretarial services to facilitate the activities of the DWG.&#13;
49.    Since most of the project activities will take place in selected rehabilitation centers and&#13;
prosthetics workshops, the PMT and the MOH Directorates at the Governorate level will need to agree on&#13;
operational and administrative procedures prior to implementation. As ownership, participation and&#13;
commitment of the local health authorities are critical for the successful implementation of the project,&#13;
much attention will be given to this process. A detailed implementation plan for each of the components&#13;
is in Annex 9.&#13;
50.    All procurement for project activities will be carried out at the central MOH level, with&#13;
participation as needed from the MOH Directorate level.&#13;
Implementation of Component 1: Policy Development and Partnerships&#13;
51.    Policy Development. The PMT will initiate and be responsible for development of the policy&#13;
framework for disabilities, and will collaborate in this activity with the DWG. The PMT will be&#13;
responsible for providing administrative support to the DWG. Activities under this component include&#13;
technical assistance to develop the policy framework. As the MOH has only a partial role in developing&#13;
the overall disability policy, it was agreed that the DWG will comprise representatives from other relevant&#13;
ministries and Government agencies, including the Prime Minister's office and the National Assembly&#13;
and representatives of the disabled.&#13;
52.    Technical assistance will involve a senior Iraqi specialist who will lead the establishment of the&#13;
DWG for the MOH as well as the development of a policy framework. This specialist could work closely&#13;
with a senior international consultant with expertise in disabilities policy who would provide advisory&#13;
support. The DWG will also have the support of locally recruited consultants who will undertake surveys&#13;
and data collection as determined by the DWG. Once established, the DWG, as a first step, will prepare a&#13;
Mission Statement and a work plan.&#13;
53.    Partnerships. Implementation of the activities that aim to enhance partnerships with NGOs will&#13;
rest with the MOH. The MOH will carry out a data collection exercise to gather key information on&#13;
existing NGOs in the area of disabilities operating in Iraq, to be followed by an assessment of the status&#13;
and performance of these NGOs. The assessment will yield a classification of NGOs according to the&#13;
following categories: (i) those providing social support to the disabled; (ii) advocacy groups; (iii) those&#13;
delivering direct services to the disabled; (iv) those working on prevention, public education and&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reintegration of the disabled into society; and (v) those working on monitoring the status of the disabled,&#13;
including registration.&#13;
54.    The MOH will organize a series of conferences and workshops with regional and local authorities&#13;
and NGOs at an early stage of project implementation. The key NGOs will be invited to participate in a&#13;
series of two-three hour coordination meetings with MOH staff, where NGOs will have the opportunity to&#13;
present their work and areas of interest. The MOH will designate staff to attend these workshops and to&#13;
serve as focal points for coordination of activities with NGOs. Through this process, the MOH will&#13;
identify areas of cooperation with NGOs and support capacity building of NGOs, possibly through&#13;
actively engaging larger experienced NGOs in training and support activities, and will provide limited&#13;
support to NGOs in implementing specific priority tasks, e.g., distribution of wheelchairs, support to&#13;
registration of the disabled; data collection and survey work.&#13;
55.    For the public awareness campaign, a public agency will be used or a suitable firm will be&#13;
contracted to: (i) develop a public information strategy, defining target audience, approach, and&#13;
implementation plan; and (ii) support the MOH in carrying out the activities included in the campaign.&#13;
Implementation of Component 2: Delivery of Services to Disabled Persons&#13;
56.    Responsibility for the implementation of this component will rest with the PMT in coordination&#13;
with the health authorities at the Governorate and Directorate levels. The MOH Directorate of Operations&#13;
and Specialized Medical Services will be responsible for overseeing the delivery and distribution of the&#13;
medical equipment, prostheses, orthoses and medical aids. The PMT will coordinate to ensure that the&#13;
activities are carried out according to the project implementation plan. To accelerate the start-up process&#13;
for civil works supported under this component, the MOH will make necessary preliminary assessments&#13;
while selected consulting firms will be hired prior to project effectiveness to prepare the design and&#13;
supervise construction works for the first group of project sites. These firms will be managed by the PMT&#13;
in cooperation with Governorate level engineers. In addition, a preliminary prototype for the workshops&#13;
is being prepared by the MOH with the help of consultants, and a list of inputs for completion of the&#13;
Terms of Reference for these firms is being finalized.&#13;
57.    The MOH has already prepared draft specification lists for procurement of medical equipment for&#13;
prosthetic workshops. Equally, draft specification lists are being prepared for equipment for rehabilitation&#13;
centers and for prostheses, orthoses, medical aids, and raw materials. The delivery of the equipment for&#13;
the workshops and physical rehabilitation sites will be carried out in coordination with the civil works&#13;
activities, to ensure that the delivery and installation take place at the appropriate point in the&#13;
rehabilitation process. Development of the distribution plan for the essential medical aids will be the&#13;
responsibility of the MOH in close collaboration with other stakeholders.&#13;
58.    The distribution plan that includes eligibility criteria for medical aids will be carefully prepared&#13;
and monitored to enable quick distribution of goods without administrative obstacles and with minimal&#13;
burden on the beneficiaries.  Development and implementation of a comprehensive distribution and&#13;
monitoring plan presents an opportunity for MOH to obtain information on beneficiaries, and to establish&#13;
close cooperation with other stakeholders in the process of distribution of medical aids to the disabled,&#13;
including local and international NGOs, clinics, hospitals, and other government agencies working in the&#13;
field.&#13;
59.    Activities in this component cover the capacity-building and training activities under the Project.&#13;
PMT will coordinate the training activities with the Directorate of Specialized Medical Services and will&#13;
ensure that the following training activities are conducted: (i) technical training for prosthetic technicians;&#13;
(ii) training for physiotherapists; (iii) management training for managers at all 18 sites; and (iv)&#13;
specialized training in physical therapy for hospital-based physicians.&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60.   Training for technicians in the workshops will be packaged together with procurement of&#13;
specialized equipment for these workshops, and the training will be conducted in well-established&#13;
prosthetic centers. The schedule for the training will also be included in the bidding documents for the&#13;
equipment. Identification of participants for the training will be the responsibility of MOH in cooperation&#13;
with the Govemorates. The Project will support the travel arrangements and accommodations for this&#13;
specialized training, while it is expected that the tuition fees will be covered by other donors or through&#13;
direct arrangements made by the MOH.&#13;
61.    The MOH will prepare a detailed plan for training of physiotherapists in cooperation with the&#13;
Governorates. As is the case for technicians in the workshops, MOH is responsible for recruitment and&#13;
retaining of staff for the physical rehabilitation centers. In this respect, a detailed plan covering human&#13;
resources, staffing, and recurrent operational budget for the centers will be prepared early in the Project.&#13;
62.    Specification of furniture and IT equipment for registration and management purposes will be&#13;
completed after the design of the centers is finished.&#13;
Implementation of Component 3: Project Management&#13;
63.    The MOH will be responsible for ensuring that the PMT is expanded and staffed with sufficient&#13;
expertise and skills to carry out the implementation of the project. In addition, the MOH is responsible&#13;
for securing adequate office space within the Ministry for the PMT to accommodate the additional staff&#13;
that will be added to manage the EDP. The PMT will act as both the coordinating unit for technical&#13;
implementation of the components, and the "business office" for the Project. The PMT will also provide&#13;
secretarial support to the DWG.&#13;
64.    The PMT will comprise: (i) a Director who will be responsible for coordinating the day-to-day&#13;
activities of both EHRP and EDP, as well as the business office functions of project management, and&#13;
liaising with the World Bank and the MOH Departments implementing project components; (ii) a&#13;
Technical Coordinator who will ensure coordination of the technical aspects of both projects; (iii) an&#13;
Assistant Technical Coordinator who will support the Technical Coordinator and who will be dedicated to&#13;
the EDP, including project monitoring and evaluation; (iii) a Procurement Officer who will be&#13;
strengthened by the addition of three specialists (civil works, equipment/medical aids and safeguards);&#13;
(iv) a Financial Officer to be shared by both projects; (v) two accountants dedicated to the EDP; (vi) an&#13;
Office Manager; and (vii) an Administrative Secretary. Additional engineers may be hired to support the&#13;
Project, as needed. In addition, there will be a driver for the EDP project vehicle and a messenger.&#13;
65.    Experience with the EHRP and other health projects within the region has shown that clear&#13;
definition of implementation procedures, including PMT responsibilities and support to project activities,&#13;
is a very important element of a successful project. In order to achieve this objective, the MOH will&#13;
select well-qualified staff for the PMT, including a full-time Technical Coordinator to support the PMT&#13;
Director, to ensure that the appropriate oversight and management of the project activities are in place.&#13;
The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) is being prepared to provide guidance in project management&#13;
and financial and procurement guidelines and procedures. The PIM will be based on the recently&#13;
finalized and adopted Master Implementation Manual (MIM) that includes procurement and financial&#13;
management guidelines and procedures, as well as documents to be used for both ITF-financed projects.&#13;
It is recognized that the PIM is intended to provide guidance on project implementation and&#13;
administration to ensure clear understanding between the implementing agency and the Bank. The PIM&#13;
will be revised during project implementation with the mutual agreement of the Bank and MOH.&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Procurement&#13;
66.    Annex 4 of the Technical Annex gives a detailed analysis of the Recipient's institutional capacity&#13;
to implement procurement, as well as the procurement plan and arrangements for the Project. The&#13;
procurement plan was agreed with the Recipient, paying particular attention to the initial procurement&#13;
activities. In order to expedite the initial activities, agreement was reached on the selection of a short list&#13;
of architectural and engineering (A/E) firms from the pre-qualified long list recently prepared for the&#13;
EHRP. These short-listed firms will be grouped by geographical location (by governorate and by region),&#13;
with two or more facilities in each package. The selected firms will be responsible for the design and&#13;
preparation of the bidding documents and construction supervision of the new rehabilitation centers (with&#13;
and without workshops) and the renovation and upgrading of existing rehabilitation centers. Terms of&#13;
Reference (TOR) for the selection of consultants for the initial services have been drafted and the&#13;
recruitment process is planned for completion within four months of Grant effectiveness. Consultants&#13;
will be selected based on the Least-Cost Selection (LCS) method. The first packages of civil works&#13;
contracts (Phase 1), estimated to cost, in the aggregate, about US$2.1 million, will be ready for tendering&#13;
within about five to six months after Grant effectiveness. Preparation of design and bidding documents&#13;
for the remaining civil works contracts will be completed in July-August 2006, and completion of such&#13;
contracts is scheduled for August-September 2007.&#13;
67.    Procurement of goods (rehabilitation and workshop equipment, medical aids and consumables&#13;
and other equipment) will be carried out in parallel with the works contracts in order to ensure that&#13;
installation and testing of the equipment is coordinated with completion of the civil works. Under Project&#13;
Component 1, Policy Development and Partnerships, NGOs will be contracted for the provision of&#13;
specific services such as distribution of medical aids to eligible beneficiaries and carrying out of&#13;
beneficiary surveys. NGOs will be selected in accordance with paragraph 3.16 of the Bank Guidelines for&#13;
the Selection and Employment of Consultants. Workshops to inform the NGOs about the project and&#13;
how they can participate will be carried out before the short-listing and selection process. It should be&#13;
noted, however, that due to the security situation, there may be only a limited number of NGOs with&#13;
access to specific locations, in which case direct contracting or subcontracting of local NGOs may be the&#13;
only viable option.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
68.    The proposed Grant of US$19.5 million is expected to be disbursed by Septemnber 30, 2007.&#13;
Annex 5, Table A describes the allocation of the grant proceeds according to each expenditure category.&#13;
69.    The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen institutional capacity by&#13;
financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries and other recipient entities. Trained PMTs&#13;
will facilitate implementation and help ensure compliance with fiduciary and other safeguards. PMTs will&#13;
be employed and paid by the implementing agency at regular salary levels, thereby avoiding the&#13;
disadvantages of stand-alone Project Implementation Units, which can erode civil service institutional&#13;
capacity over the medium and long term. The Project will finance specialized technical support in&#13;
procurement, financial management and other areas, as needed. In addition, to ensure that project funds&#13;
are used for the purposes intended and to help carry out project supervision on the ground in Iraq, the&#13;
Bank has hired an independent firm as Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA).&#13;
70.    As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily through direct payment&#13;
by the Bank to the contractors, consultants, and vendors. Once authorized by the MOH, direct payments&#13;
will be made by the World Bank directly into the account of the contractor, consultant, or vendor in a&#13;
commercial bank capable of receiving funds transferred from the international banking system.&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71.    The project management component and payments below the threshold of US$10,000 normally&#13;
will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own resources. These payments made from the&#13;
Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed, on a periodic basis, by the Bank to the MOH upon&#13;
presentation of full supporting documents, proof of payment and a signed withdrawal application. The&#13;
Bank may later require the use of Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for payments below US$10,000. The&#13;
PMT and the main financial counterparts from the MOH will be subject to intensive training in Bank&#13;
disbursement procedures.&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
72.    The project financial resources are extended through the ITF and will be managed within the&#13;
framework of the MOH systems, regulations and controls. Presently, the MOH is also implementing the&#13;
EHRP. A financial management assessment was undertaken through meetings with representatives from&#13;
MOH and the EHRP PMT to update knowledge of the MOH financial management system and to&#13;
determine the arrangements to be adopted in order to enhance the existing controls and fulfill the&#13;
reporting requirements of the Project.&#13;
73.    Based on the result of the assessment and the outcome of the various reports issued by&#13;
independent auditors and other donors, the fiduciary risk of the Grant not being used for the intended&#13;
purposes, with due regard to economy, efficiency, and the sustainable achievement of the Project's&#13;
development, is considered as high. The financial management risk as an element of the fiduciary risk is&#13;
also high.&#13;
74.    The financial management arrangements of the Project are basically similar to those being&#13;
followed under the EHRP, taking into consideration the specific activities under the Project and the&#13;
hurdles being faced during the implementation of the EHRP. This financial management risk will be&#13;
partly managed through: (i) reinforcing the present controls as applied by the MOH; (ii) the engagement&#13;
of a dedicated financial officer and an accountant to manage the project financial activities; (iii) payments&#13;
to most contractors, consultants and vendors will be made through direct payment method, while&#13;
payments below the threshold of US$10,000 will be reimbursed to the ministry upon presentation of&#13;
supporting documentation and proof of payment; (iv) gathering and monitoring the generation of monthly&#13;
reports by the Directorates/centers on implementation activities; (v) maintaining a fixed assets&#13;
spreadsheet for purchased and delivered equipment; (vi) using a spreadsheet application to keep track of&#13;
the project accounts and to generate the project reports; (vii) having a FMA inside Iraq to monitor the&#13;
project activities and support the PMTs; (viii) the engagement of an independent auditor, with&#13;
international experience acceptable to the Bank, to perform the project audit and issue an independent&#13;
auditor's opinion; and (ix) documenting project arrangements in a chapter of the PIM based on the Master&#13;
Implementation Manual.&#13;
75.    Despite the above, the residual risks, where possible, will be managed during project&#13;
implementation through close monitoring and supervision by the Bank team's Financial Management&#13;
Specialist (FMS).&#13;
76.    The financial management-related risks and risk management tools are included in tabular form&#13;
in the detailed risk analysis (Section F). The project financial management arrangements and identified&#13;
risks are detailed in Annex 5.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Supervision&#13;
77.    Project activities will be completed by September 2007. Supervision, to be carried out by the&#13;
Bank's local consultants and the FMA, will include visits to the MOH, MOF, MOPDC, and MOLSA as&#13;
well as to the rehabilitation centers and prosthetic workshop sites for the purpose of reviewing&#13;
implementation progress, impact of project activities, and related documentation.&#13;
78.    The PMT will prepare and send to the Bank a quarterly progress report. The first report will be&#13;
due starting at the end of the first quarter following the initial disbursement. The format of the report was&#13;
agreed during appraisal.&#13;
79.    The Bank, as the ITF Administrator, will supervise ITF-funded operations in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's applicable policies and procedures. While staff travel to Iraq is restricted, supervision of recipient-&#13;
executed operations will be carried out through consultants and the FMA. Each ITF-funded operation is&#13;
required to include a results-based supervision plan that reflects realities on the ground.&#13;
80.    Reporting to Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of&#13;
the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF. Within ninety (90) days of the end of each&#13;
quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31), the Bank will prepare, on a cash basis, an&#13;
un-audited statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a&#13;
copy to each donor. Each such statement will be expressed in United States Dollars, the currency in which&#13;
the ITF funds will be maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred and eighty (180) days of&#13;
the completion of all disbursements relating to activities financed from the ITF, the Bank will prepare on&#13;
a cash basis an un-audited financial statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to&#13;
the ITF and forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
81.    The Bank will furnish the donors:&#13;
(a) on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of the ITF (including&#13;
contributions, disbursements, and implementation progress) in the preceding six months; and&#13;
(b) on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation from the Bank's&#13;
external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial&#13;
reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
82.    The Bank will require a financial statement audit of the ITF to be performed by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors on an annual basis. The costs of such an audit, including the internal costs of the Bank&#13;
with respect to the audit, will be charged to the ITF. The Bank will provide each donor with a copy of the&#13;
auditor's report.&#13;
83.    The Bank will maintain close consultation and coordination with the donors. The Bank will&#13;
provide each donor to the ITF with semi-annual reports on its quarterly ex-post evaluation of the activities&#13;
undertaken by the FMA. Within six months of completion of the activities, or of full disbursement of the&#13;
contributions, whichever comes later, the Bank will provide a final progress report to each donor, together&#13;
with a copy of the independent review of the performance of the FMA. Upon request by any donor, the&#13;
Bank will send to such donor the draft and final reports received by the Bank from the FMA on the&#13;
activities financed by the contributions.&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
84.    Environmental Safeguards: The Project is rated category "B". Impacts would be those associated&#13;
mainly with (i) new construction and renovation of Disability Rehabilitation Centers and Workshops&#13;
(e.g., safety, dust, noise, waste material, and vehicular traffic); (ii) provision of sanitary services, water&#13;
supply and waste management; and (iii) operation and maintenance of Disability Rehabilitation Centers&#13;
and Workshops. Because of the emergency conditions, the requirement to carry out a limited&#13;
Environmental Analysis as part of project preparation will be waived. However, for sub-projects with&#13;
possible moderate or minor adverse environmental impacts, a limited Environmental Analysis will be&#13;
carried out during project design for World Bank approval prior to execution of such works. The&#13;
Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) was disclosed in the country&#13;
and in the Infoshop in November 2005. Based on the ESSAF, the following standards will be applied&#13;
during implementation: (i) inclusion of standard environmental codes of practice (ECOP) in the bid&#13;
documents for rehabilitation and extension works (Annex 7A); (ii) use of Safeguard Procedures for&#13;
Inclusion in the Technical Specifications of Contracts (Annex 7B); (iii) use of the Checklist of likely&#13;
Environmental and Social Impacts of Subprojects; (iv) review and oversight of any major reconstruction&#13;
works by specialists; (v) implementation of environmentally and socially sound options for civil works;&#13;
and (vi) provision for adequate budget and satisfactory institutional arrangements to monitor effective&#13;
implementation and adequately operate and maintain sanitary facilities after project completion. Capacity&#13;
building on Safeguards and on the implementation of the ESSAF has already been undertaken with the&#13;
Ministry of Environment and other line Ministries under the EHRP.&#13;
85.   Resettlement, and Land Acquisition: The Project will include both new construction and&#13;
renovation of rehabilitation centers and workshops in 18 sites on Government-owned land without&#13;
squatters. The building extensions will be carried out within existing govemment-owned plots of land&#13;
which are not occupied by squatters. Therefore, World Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.12) would not be&#13;
triggered since there would not be any involuntary relocation of populations or expropriation of privately&#13;
owned land. However, the ESSAF, specifically elaborated for due diligence of emergency projects in&#13;
Iraq, will be used to ensure that this is indeed the case and, should there be any need for expropriation of&#13;
privately owned land or/and involuntary relocation of population, the same guidelines would be followed.&#13;
Quarterly and annual implementation progress reports should include a section for reporting compliance&#13;
with World Bank safeguard policy.&#13;
E.     FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
86.    This Project is prepared as part of the interim strategy of the World Bank in addressing the&#13;
pressing needs of the sector and according to the emergency recovery assistance procedures (OP 8.50).&#13;
The lack of reliable statistics, the limited economic information, and the speed at which the project has&#13;
been prepared have prevented more detailed analysis, a familiar constraint in such operations. However,&#13;
the benefits of the Project's investment are expected to be substantial compared to its costs, as it addresses&#13;
urgent needs in an environment of devastated infrastructure, deteriorating quality, and escalating needs.&#13;
The Project will support the construction of six new basic rehabilitation centers, and three new&#13;
rehabilitation centers with prosthetic workshop. In addition, five existing rehabilitation centers will be&#13;
renovated. Another four existing rehabilitation centers are in satisfactory condition and therefore will&#13;
benefit only from training and limited equipment, while the others will receive support in civil works&#13;
renovation, equipment and training. These facilities are situated in 15 of Iraq's Governorates, and will&#13;
serve the needs of up to 250,000 PWD who would otherwise not have access to quality rehabilitation&#13;
services and would be denied the right to work and to lead a productive life.&#13;
87.   This Project will support expansion of the capacity of the rehabilitation centers to provide for the&#13;
needs of the disabled, and the prosthetic workshops to provide the prosthetic and orthotic devices needed&#13;
by those individuals who have suffered loss of limbs. The technical capacity of these centers to handle&#13;
the needs of the disabled will be improved through technical assistance and training to be provided under&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the Project. In addition, a total of approximately 1.4 million Iraqis, representing the families of the&#13;
disabled, will be direct beneficiaries of the Project. It is well-known that the disabled who receive&#13;
appropriate care and medical aids are less dependent, are once again in a position to contribute to the&#13;
family income, experience a reduction of social stigma, and are able to resume schooling and other&#13;
available opportunities, and have the chance once again to become productive members of society. This&#13;
Project will support expansion of the capacity of the rehabilitation centers to provide for the needs of the&#13;
disabled, and the prosthetic workshops to provide the prosthetic and orthotic devices required by those&#13;
disabled without limbs. The technical and management capacity of the system to handle the needs of the&#13;
disabled will be improved through technical assistance and training to be provided under the Project. By&#13;
supporting the NGOs, the Project will establish partnerships between the Government and the&#13;
communities, and stimulate private entrepreneurship in the area of disabilities. Recurrent costs of the&#13;
facilities renovated and constructed under the Project will be met from the MOH operational budget.&#13;
Future maintenance costs of these facilities will be covered by the overall MOH budget and do not&#13;
constitute a sustainability problem.&#13;
F.     RISKS&#13;
88.    The Project will be implemented in a high-risk environment. Iraq's security environment is&#13;
unstable, and the country is undergoing a major political transition. The table below provides a summary&#13;
of the key project risks that have been identified, and the measures to be taken to mitigate those risks.&#13;

1.    Project information:&#13;
Country:                           Republic of Iraq&#13;
Recipient:                         Ministry of Health&#13;
Project Name:                      Emergency Disabilities Project&#13;
Project No.:                       P096774&#13;
Trust Fund Grant Amount:           US$19.5 million&#13;
Project Implementing Agency (PIA):  The Ministry of Health&#13;
2.     Bank's approval Date of the Procurement Plan: November 17, 2005&#13;
3.     Date of General Procurement Notice: December 12, 2005&#13;
4.     Period covered by this procurement plan: Two years&#13;
II.    Goods and Works and Non-Consulting Services&#13;
1.    Prior Review Threshold: Procurement Decisions subject to Prior Review by the Bank as stated in&#13;
Appendix 1 to the Guidelines for Procurement:&#13;
Procurement Method          Prior Review Threshold            Comments&#13;
1.   Shopping (Goods and Works)  First three purchase orders/contracts&#13;
2.   NCB (Goods)                First three contracts &gt;=US$ 100,000&#13;
3.   NCB (works)                All &gt;=US$200,000               Could be revised during&#13;
project implementation&#13;
4    Direct Contracting/Purchase  All&#13;
5    ICB (Goods/works)          All&#13;
2.     Reference to Project Implementation Manual&#13;
The Project Management Team (PMT) will prepare a simple Project Implementation Manual (PIM) by&#13;
March 2006. The PIM will be based on the MIM which was prepared by an intemational consulting firm&#13;
financed under the Capacity Building Trust Fund for Iraq.&#13;
3.     Procurement Packages with Methods and Time Schedule&#13;
It is not expected at this time that intemational construction contractors will be interested in the works&#13;
contracts under this project, especially given the current security situation in Iraq and the relatively small&#13;
size contracts, which will be scattered over 15 Govemorates. Therefore, all civil works contracts will be&#13;
procured using National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. However, if the security conditions&#13;
improve during project implementation, the PMT would consider packaging smaller contracts into larger&#13;
contracts suitable for Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB) that may attract intemational companies.&#13;
Procurement of goods will be primarily through ICB, and it will consist primarily of supply and&#13;
installation of equipment for physical disability rehabilitation centers and equipment for prosthesis&#13;
workshops, medical aids, consumables, fumiture and office equipment and vehicles. There is no domestic&#13;
preference under the Project. A detailed procurement plan is attached at the end of this annex.&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III.   Selection of Consultants&#13;
1.     Selection&#13;
Due to the emergency nature of the Project, advance procurement will be used for the contracting of&#13;
Architectural/Engineering (A/E) consultants for the design and supervision of construction of physical&#13;
rehabilitation centers and workshops located in about fifteen Governorates. About six design/supervision&#13;
contracts, each estimated to cost about US$200,000 equivalent, are anticipated. Selection of these&#13;
consulting firms will be based on the Least-Cost Selection (LCS) method. For each of the six groups, a&#13;
short-list consisting of at least three firms will be prepared based on a long-list of qualified firms, which&#13;
were developed under the EHRP. Due to the security situation in Iraq, it is not expected that these&#13;
design/supervision contracts would be of interest to foreign consultants. However, there will be an&#13;
advertisement in the UJNDB and dgMarket for expression of interest for contracts estimated at&#13;
US$200,000 or more. NGOs would be needed for the distribution of medical aids to eligible beneficiaries&#13;
and possibly to undertake other project related activities at the community level. NGOs would be selected&#13;
in accordance with the provisions in paragraph 3.16 of the Bank Guidelines for the Selection of&#13;
Consultants and Employment of Consultants. NGOs would be identified, for the preparation of short lists,&#13;
after holding project-briefing workshops. The criteria for the selection of NGOs would be determined&#13;
after holding these workshops to better understand how these organizations are established and organized,&#13;
and the specific conditions under which they can operate. Due to the security situation, there may be cases&#13;
where direct contracting or subcontracting of NGOs may be the only viable option.&#13;
2.     Prior Review Threshold&#13;
Selection decisions subject to Prior Review by the Bank as stated in Appendix I to the Guidelines&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants:&#13;
Selection Method          Prior Review Threshold         Comments&#13;
1. Competitive Methods (Firms)  First three contracts&#13;
&gt;=US$100,000&#13;
2. Single Source (Firms)         All&#13;
3. Individual Consultants        All &gt;=US$50,000&#13;
4. Single Source (individual)    All&#13;
3.     Short list comprised entirely of national consultant&#13;
Based on the response for expression of interest to be advertised in UNDB and dgMarket, a short list of&#13;
consultants for services may be comprised entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions&#13;
of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
4.     Any Other Special Selection Arrangements&#13;
The PMT is considering the employment of individual consultants with experience in Bank procurement,&#13;
and technical experts with experience in physical disability and workshop equipment, as well as&#13;
environmental and social safeguards to assist the PMT in the implementation of the project. It is expected&#13;
that international consulting firms and individuals may not be interested in providing consultancy services&#13;
within the country while the security situation is as volatile as is the case now in Iraq. However, should&#13;
the security conditions improve and international consultants show interest, the participation of&#13;
international consultants would be assessed by the PMT and the Bank team for their inclusion. It is also&#13;
expected that consulting offices associated with local universities may be included in the short lists.&#13;
University-based consultants shall not have preference over private consultants.&#13;

ANNEX 5: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
I.     Executive Summary and Conclusion&#13;
1.    The project financial resources are extended through the ITF and will be managed within the&#13;
framework of the Ministry of Health systems, regulations and controls. Presently, the MOH is&#13;
implementing the EHRP that is also financed through the ITF. A preliminary financial management&#13;
assessment was performed and will be completed during project appraisal. Consequently, the financial&#13;
management arrangements of the Project would be adapted to enhance the existing controls and to cater to&#13;
the reporting requirements of the Project.&#13;
2.     The fiduciary risk of the Grant not being used for the intended purposes, with due regard to&#13;
economy, efficiency, and the sustainable achievement of the project's development objective, is&#13;
considered as high. The financial management risk as an element of the fiduciary risk is also considered&#13;
as high. This rating is the result of the preliminary assessment performed by the Bank team and the&#13;
outcome of the various reports issued by independent auditors and other donors.&#13;
3.     The financial management arrangements for this Project are expected basically to be somewhat&#13;
similar to those being followed under the EHRP, but would be revised based on the specific project&#13;
arrangements, taking into consideration the hurdles being faced during the implementation of the EHRP.&#13;
This financial management risk will be partly managed through: (i) reinforcing the present controls as&#13;
applied by the MOH; (ii) the engagement of a dedicated financial officer and an accountant to follow-on&#13;
the project financial activities; (iii) payments to most contractors, consultants and vendors will be made&#13;
through direct payment method, while payments below the threshold of US$10,000 will be reimbursed to&#13;
the ministry upon presentation of supporting documentation and proof of payment; (iv) gathering and&#13;
monitoring the generation of monthly reports by the Directorates/centers on implementation activities; (v)&#13;
maintaining a fixed assets spreadsheet for purchased and delivered equipment; (vi) using a spreadsheet&#13;
application to follow on the project accounts and to generate the project reports; (vii) having a Monitoring&#13;
Agent inside Iraq to monitor the project activities and support the PMTs; and (viii) the engagement of an&#13;
independent auditor, with intemational experience acceptable to the bank, to perform the project audit and&#13;
issue an independent auditor opinion. All the above activities and procedures will be documented in a&#13;
chapter of the PIM based on the MIM.&#13;
4.     Despite the above, the residual risk, where possible, will be managed during project&#13;
implementation through close monitoring and supervision by the project FMS.&#13;
5.     The financial management related risks and risk-management tools are included in tabular form&#13;
in the detailed risk analysis (Section F). The project financial management arrangements and identified&#13;
risks are detailed at the end of this Annex.&#13;
35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II.    Managing Financial Management Risk&#13;
Country Financial Management Risk&#13;
6.     A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was not undertaken for Iraq. However,&#13;
many reports, including the IMF-World Bank Report of April 2005 on Iraq Public Financial&#13;
Management6 , show a high inherent risk in almost all the main functions of a financial management&#13;
system (budgeting, internal controls, accounting, reporting). The security situation, the huge weaknesses&#13;
of the banking system which hamper the domestic payment system and the accuracy of the budget&#13;
reporting, and the many years of isolation that Iraq has encountered also add to that risk. This risk will be&#13;
partly managed through the implementation and management of the Project by the PMT.&#13;
Project Financial Management Risk.&#13;
7.     The project FM risk remains high. A detailed assessment is enclosed within the overall project&#13;
risk (Section F). It can be summarized by the following:&#13;
*  Limited capacity to meet FM requirements of the Project at MOH and Governorates;&#13;
*  The inability of carrying out on-site supervision missions and physical inspections;&#13;
*  The lack of a fixed assets management system to maintain purchased and delivered equipment&#13;
and furniture;&#13;
*  Delays in issuing authorizations for payments leading to overdue contractors' payments and thus&#13;
undermining competitiveness and leading to higher costs;&#13;
*  The banking payment system shortfalls, where payments may be delayed or lost;&#13;
*  Possible low level of coordination and reporting arrangements between the PMT, the directorates&#13;
and centers;&#13;
*  Not being able to maintain a project account for payment of small amount (less than US$10,000)&#13;
throughout the life of the project, leading to shortages and delays in payments and&#13;
reimbursements.&#13;
III.   MOH Project Arrangements&#13;
8.     The FM risk is partly managed through a set of procedures classified as follows:&#13;
9.     Payment Authorization and Flow of Information. The project activities, including invoices for&#13;
advance payments or for actual incurred expenditures, are subject to MOH applicable controls and&#13;
procedures in addition to the PMT verification and approval. Streamlined arrangements for processing of&#13;
contract approvals and payment authorizations would be put in place to overcome delays experienced in&#13;
the current project.&#13;
10.    Accounting System. The PMT has a financial team composed of a financial officer and an&#13;
accountant. This team will undertake the project request for payments, accounting and reporting activities.&#13;
It will coordinate closely with the MOH financial department and the other related points of contact at the&#13;
MOH directorates. Spread sheet applications will be used to record the project transactions and to track&#13;
the project accounts and generate the financial reports needed for monitoring and decision-making.&#13;

Reporting&#13;
11.    Ouarterlv: The MOH will generate interim unaudited financial reports/Financial Monitoring&#13;
Reports (FMRs) and submit them to the Bank within 45 days from the end of the period. These reports&#13;
are made up of:&#13;
*  Financial Reports: to include a statement of sources and uses of funds by category, uses of&#13;
funds/expenditure report by directorate and category comparing actual and planned expenditures.&#13;
Also, a narrative report explaining all variances that exceed 15% when compared to plan and the&#13;
proposed corrective actions should be included as an annex to the financial reports.&#13;
*  Contracts Reports: to provide information on contracts, including information on all authorized&#13;
contract variations, showing contracts' financial status against plan, and percentage of works&#13;
completed against payments.&#13;
*  Equipment and furniture Reports: to provide information on goods purchased and delivered&#13;
under the project per governorate.&#13;
12.    The proposed format of the reports is in the project files and has been agreed upon with the MOH&#13;
representatives during appraisal/negotiations.&#13;
13.    Annuallv: Audited Project Financial Statements (PFS), showing yearly and cumulative balances,&#13;
will be submitted to the Bank. PFS will include:&#13;
*  Statement of sources and uses of funds by component.&#13;
*  Appropriate schedules classifying project expenditures by category.&#13;
*  List of commitments or signed contracts.&#13;
* Statement of equipment and furniture purchased.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14.    Audit Arrangements. An external independent auditor with international experience will be&#13;
engaged to perform the project audit and issue an independent opinion on the project financial statements&#13;
(PFS) and compliance with World Bank Procurement Guidelines and terms of the Grant Agreement. The&#13;
external audit report will encompass all of the Project's activities and will be in accordance with&#13;
internationally accepted auditing standards. MOH will remit a project audit report to the Bank not later&#13;
than four months after the end of each fiscal year. The auditor selection process will be launched directly&#13;
after the Grant Agreement is signed. An escrow account will be used to pay the auditor after the project&#13;
Closing Date. In addition to the audit reports, the auditor will prepare a "management letter" identifying&#13;
any observations, comments, and deficiencies in the system and controls that the auditor considers&#13;
pertinent, and will provide recommendations for their improvements.&#13;
15.    Project Implementation Manual. All the above activities and procedures will be documented.&#13;
within a financial management chapter of the PIM. This manual will be based on the recently finalized&#13;
and adopted MIM that includes procurement and financial management guidelines and procedures, as&#13;
well as documents to be used for both ITF-financed projects.&#13;
16.    Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA). The Bank has engaged an independent firm that will operate&#13;
in Iraq as FMA for ITF-financed projects. This FMA has dual roles:&#13;
*  Verifying and validating to the Bank the project's financial management and procurement&#13;
arrangements and internal controls agreed upon with the implementing agencies.&#13;
* Providing advisory services and technical support to the Iraqi Government and the ITF-financed&#13;
projects relating to the projects' financial management and procurement arrangements and the&#13;
generation of periodical and reliable financial reports.&#13;
IV.    Bank Financial Management Supervision&#13;
17.    Where security conditions make travel to Iraq impossible for Bank staff, supervision missions&#13;
will be undertaken in an alternative country. The Bank supervision mission after Project Effectiveness&#13;
will take the form of a Project Launch Workshop where further training on Bank procedures and&#13;
guidelines will be provided. Intensive supervision will be required initially to ensure that the PMT and&#13;
the qualified staff from the MOH Finance Department are well-trained in implementation of Bank-&#13;
financed projects.&#13;

Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
18.    The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to implement projects though the Iraqi Ministries (rather than&#13;
through project implementation units outside government structures), ensuring that appropriate and&#13;
effective financial controls are in place over the use of funds provided by the Bank, while at the same&#13;
time working together to strengthen the Ministries' own financial control processes and procedures.&#13;
Taking into consideration the high risk environment assessed for the Project, including the assessed high&#13;
financial management risk, the disbursement arrangements will compensate by continuing to use&#13;
conservative disbursement methods. The disbursement methods to be used will be:&#13;
(i)    Direct Payments to contractors, suppliers and consultants for eligible expenditures, for&#13;
disbursements over US$10,000.&#13;
(ii)   Reimbursement to the MOH for eligible expenditures under US$10,000 paid from the MOH&#13;
resources.&#13;
(iii)  Special Commitments to a commercial bank to reimburse the commercial bank for payments&#13;
made to a supplier against Letters of Credit issued at the request of the MOH for eligible expenditures.&#13;
19.    These are the disbursement methods that have been used for the existing World Bank ITF&#13;
projects currently under implementation and which have proven to be effective. Extensive training has&#13;
been provided to the PMT of the EHRP on the Bank's disbursement processes. Supporting&#13;
documentation, e.g., copies of invoices and receipts, is required to be provided with all requests to&#13;
disburse funds. The original copies of the supporting documentation will be maintained by the MOH and&#13;
made available for review by Bank representatives upon request.&#13;
20.    The agreements with the Donors to the WB ITF allow for the financing of 100 percent of project&#13;
expenditures. The MOH contributes implementation support, including the assignment of MOH staff to&#13;
the PMT, MOH staff support in the MOH Directorates, and some related operating expenses.&#13;

ANNEX 7: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT&#13;
FRAMEWORK&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) will provide the general&#13;
policies, guidelines, codes of practice and procedures to be integrated into the implementation of the&#13;
Project (see Annex 7A).&#13;
Potential Adverse Impact&#13;
The activities supported by the Project comprise renovation and expansion of disability rehabilitation&#13;
centers and workshops. Potential adverse environmental impacts (summarized below) are restricted in&#13;
scope and severity:&#13;
* Dust and noise due to demolition and construction;&#13;
* Dumping of demolition and construction wastes and accidental spillage of machine oil, lubricants, etc;&#13;
* Risk for inadequate use of hazardous anti termite chemicals during foundation works; and&#13;
* Risk for inadequate handling of wastewater, and waste material during operation of workshops.&#13;
Handling of Non-medical Wastes&#13;
It will be the responsibility of MOH to provide training courses for all staff involved in the management&#13;
of wastes from rehabilitation centers and workshops to make them aware of hazards, as well as to educate&#13;
patients and visitors on proper hygiene and cleanliness with respect to waste. Public awareness campaigns&#13;
should be held at the community level. The training of personnel should not solely explain routine&#13;
procedures, but should also cover emergency procedures, such as what action should be taken as a result&#13;
of a spillage of particular types of waste. It would also be the responsibility of MOH to develop and&#13;
monitor supplies and consumer policies which aim to minimize the level of waste generated as a result of&#13;
the provision of services.&#13;
In order to ensure the safe and efficient handling and disposal of waste generated in the rehabilitation&#13;
centers and workshops, it will be necessary to develop operational policies. These should be based upon&#13;
the central MOH principle of strict segregation between medical and domestic waste and appropriate&#13;
disposal of waste.&#13;
In order to be compliant with emerging guidelines and promote an environmentally-conscious approach&#13;
to waste management, operational policies should also be based on the segregation of domestic waste into&#13;
organic, non-organic and recyclable categories.&#13;
Workshops Waste Management Plans&#13;
The establishment of Workshop Waste Management Plans is not included in the proposed project for&#13;
renovation and extension of rehabilitation centers and workshops, but the issue should be considered in&#13;
future projects in Iraq. Factors that govern waste management strategies are the legislative and regulatory&#13;
framework, and the waste treatment and disposal costs. The waste should be collected by specialist&#13;
contractors for proper disposal in approved landfills elsewhere in the municipality.&#13;

V.     Earthworks&#13;
21.    Earthworks shall be properly controlled, especially during the rainy season.&#13;
22.    The Contractor shall maintain stable cut and fill slopes at all times and cause the least possible&#13;
disturbance to areas outside the prescribed limits of the work.&#13;
23.    The Contractor shall complete cut and fill operations to final cross-sections at any one location as&#13;
soon as possible and preferably in one continuous operation to avoid partially completed earthworks,&#13;
especially during the rainy season.&#13;
24.    In order to protect any cut or fill slopes from erosion, in accordance with the drawings, cut off&#13;
drains and toe-drains shall be provided at the top and bottom of slopes and be planted with grass or other&#13;
plant cover. Cut off drains should be provided above high cuts to minimize water runoff and slope&#13;
erosion.&#13;
25.    Any excavated cut or unsuitable material shall be disposed of in designated tipping areas as&#13;
agreed to by the Engineer.&#13;
26.    Tips should not be located where they can cause future slides, interfere with agricultural land or&#13;
any other properties, or cause soil from the dump to be washed into any watercourse. Drains may need to&#13;
be dug within and around the tips, as directed by the Engineer.&#13;
VI.    Historical and Archeological Sites&#13;
27.    If the Contractor discovers archeological sites, historical sites, remains and objects, including&#13;
graveyards and/or individual graves during excavation or construction, the Contractor shall:&#13;
(a) Stop the construction activities in the area of the chance find.&#13;
(b) Delineate the discovered site or area.&#13;
(c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects. In cases of removable&#13;
antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the responsible local&#13;
authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over.&#13;
(d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local authorities and&#13;
the Ministry of Culture immediately (less than 24 hours).&#13;
(e) Contact the responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture who would be in charge&#13;
of protecting and preserving the site before deciding on the proper procedures to be carried&#13;
out. This would require a preliminary evaluation of the findings to be performed by the&#13;
archeologists of the Ministry of Culture (within 72 hours). The significance and importance&#13;
of the findings should be assessed according to the various criteria relevant to cultural&#13;
heritage, including the aesthetic, historic, scientific or research, social and economic values.&#13;
(f) Ensure that decisions on how to handle the finding be taken by the responsible authorities and&#13;
the Ministry of Culture. This could include changes in the layout (such as when the finding is&#13;
an irremovable remain of cultural or archeological importance) conservation, preservation,&#13;
restoration and salvage.&#13;
(g) Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management of the finding shall be&#13;

28.    Debris generated due to the dismantling of the existing structures shall be suitably reused, to the&#13;
extent feasible, in the proposed construction (e.g., as fill materials for embankments). The disposal of&#13;
remaining debris shall be carried out only at sites identified and approved by the project engineer. The&#13;
contractor should ensure that these sites (a) are not located within designated forest areas; (b) do not&#13;
impact natural drainage courses; and (c) do not impact endangered/rare flora. Under no circumstances&#13;
shall the contractor dispose of any material in environmentally sensitive areas.&#13;
29.    In the event any debris or silt from the sites is deposited on adjacent land, the Contractor shall&#13;
immediately remove such, debris or silt and restore the affected area to its original state to the satisfaction&#13;
of the Supervisor/Engineer.&#13;
30.    Bentonite slurry or similar debris generated from pile driving or other construction activities shall&#13;
be disposed of to avoid overflow into the surface water bodies or form mud puddles in the area.&#13;
31.    All arrangements for transportation during construction including provision, maintenance,&#13;
dismantling and clearing debris, where necessary, will be considered incidental to the work and should be&#13;
planned and implemented by the contractor as approved and directed by the Engineer.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Emergency
            Disabilities Project for Iraq is to support the delivery of
            improved rehabilitation and prosthetic services that reduce
            the burden of physical disability. There will be three
            project components:  1) policy development and partnerships
            (US$0.8 million total, including contingencies) to develop a
            comprehensive policy and legislative framework for
            disabilities, and to initiate an enabling environment for
            development of partnerships between the Ministry of Health,
            other ministries, and civil society; 2) delivery of services
            to disabled persons (US$18 million total, including
            contingencies) to improve the delivery of community-oriented
            rehabilitation and prosthetic services for disabled persons
            in selected sites throughout the country; and 3) project
            management (US$0.7 million total, including contingencies)
            to ensure effective administration and coordination of the
            project activities.
