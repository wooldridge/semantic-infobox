         MR. WOLFENSOHN:     Perhaps I can open the meeting,&#13;
&#13;
which is a Bank/IDA meeting.      Items one and two relate to&#13;
&#13;
the Poverty Reduction Progress Report for Fiscal 2000 and&#13;
&#13;
2001, and the additional document on "Attacking Poverty:&#13;
&#13;
Operationalizing of the WDR 2000/01 at the World Bank".&#13;
&#13;
         These papers were discussed in CODE on June 6th&#13;
&#13;
and a very useful statement was issued by the Chairperson&#13;
&#13;
on June 8th.   And I would like to thank him for that.&#13;
&#13;
         I would like to welcome Mr. McDonald who is the&#13;
&#13;
Deputy Chief, Fiscal Affairs Department, and Mr. Lankes,&#13;
&#13;
Advisor, Policy Development and Review Department, of the&#13;
&#13;
Fund who are attending this meeting or I hope are&#13;
&#13;
attending this meeting.&#13;
&#13;
         And let me acknowledge also the statements by&#13;
&#13;
Ms. O'Leary and Messrs. Alyahya, Meyer and Toure that have&#13;
&#13;
been circulated in advance.&#13;
&#13;
         I would like to start by asking Pieter Stek, as&#13;
&#13;
Chairman of CODE, to introduce his comments and thereafter&#13;
&#13;
I will get John Page and Giovanna Prennushi to lead off&#13;
&#13;
the discussion.&#13;
&#13;
         So, Mr. Stek.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
            I think we had a good session in the Committee&#13;
&#13;
and that was thanks to the quality of the papers and&#13;
&#13;
thanks to the quality of the presentation by John and&#13;
&#13;
Giovanna, and also I think this was the case in quite a&#13;
&#13;
short period of time where obviously the interaction&#13;
&#13;
between earlier comments from OED and what management has&#13;
&#13;
been able to use from those comments has worked out in a&#13;
&#13;
very good way.    So I just want to stress that that is a&#13;
&#13;
very important point.&#13;
&#13;
            Just to highlight a few points because the paper&#13;
&#13;
is on the table, our report.       I think the Committee as a&#13;
&#13;
whole endorsed management's recommendations to discontinue&#13;
&#13;
the PTI targeted interventions in order to focus more on&#13;
&#13;
strengthened poverty monitoring and evaluation systems and&#13;
&#13;
capacity.    And also, there was agreement to streamline&#13;
&#13;
reporting to the Board.     In effect, a large majority of&#13;
&#13;
the Committee members supported combining the two reports&#13;
&#13;
into one for dissemination.&#13;
&#13;
            As you will see in the report, the Committee&#13;
&#13;
noted the need for more systematic analysis of the poverty&#13;
&#13;
impact of the Bank's work.      That was regarded as an&#13;
&#13;
important point by many.     So poverty impact assessments&#13;
&#13;
are something we are waiting to see developed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         Members also emphasized the importance of&#13;
&#13;
accurate data for strong analytical work on the causes of&#13;
&#13;
poverty in order to develop sound strategies.&#13;
&#13;
         On empowerment, members broadly supported the&#13;
&#13;
focus on inclusion, giving voice to the poor and investing&#13;
&#13;
in poor people, but the staff guidance note on empowerment&#13;
&#13;
is awaited eagerly, in fact, and it is hoped that this&#13;
&#13;
will develop appropriately ideas on how to address&#13;
&#13;
institutional development, and will also take into account&#13;
&#13;
the potential risks in this area, because it was noted by&#13;
&#13;
several that this is a highly political area.&#13;
&#13;
         The Committee also noted the proposed increase&#13;
&#13;
in analytical work and asked that the resource&#13;
&#13;
implications be more clearly identified to ensure their&#13;
&#13;
implementation.   That may be something that management&#13;
&#13;
wants to return to because it was not clear from the&#13;
&#13;
document fully how to achieve clarity.&#13;
&#13;
         Then, finally, as a last comment, the Committee&#13;
&#13;
noted the need for a more fundamental discussion on&#13;
&#13;
community-driven development and management agreed to&#13;
&#13;
schedule a technical briefing for the Board shortly.&#13;
&#13;
         Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. WOLFENSOHN:     Thank you very much, Mr. Stek.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         Now let me ask John Page and Giovanna Prennushi&#13;
&#13;
to introduce the discussion.&#13;
&#13;
         John.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. PAGE:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
         I will be very brief.      Giovanna will introduce&#13;
&#13;
the two papers and respond to some of the issues raised by&#13;
&#13;
CODE and comments that we received last night from a&#13;
&#13;
number of Directors.    Simply to point out that a number of&#13;
&#13;
my colleagues are also in the room -- Jo Ritzen from DEC;&#13;
&#13;
Joanne Salop is sitting in the Bank; Deepa Narayan and&#13;
&#13;
Robert Holzmann on the social protection strategy.          So we&#13;
&#13;
are prepared to deal with a range of issues with respect&#13;
&#13;
to the implementation of the Bank's work on poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction as the discussion moves forward.         And we&#13;
&#13;
certainly welcome the comments of the Directors in&#13;
&#13;
guidance to us as we try to bring these two reports&#13;
&#13;
together and prepare them for general dissemination.&#13;
&#13;
         Giovanna.&#13;
&#13;
         MS. PRENNUSHI:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
         It is a pleasure to meet with you again and have&#13;
&#13;
the opportunity to discuss progress towards achieving the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's mission of reducing poverty.       Today, we are&#13;
&#13;
discussing two documents.    The first is the Annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
Progress Report on Poverty Reduction; this is the seventh&#13;
&#13;
in a series of annual reports.        It is the third&#13;
&#13;
opportunity to discuss with you.         So it has been an annual&#13;
&#13;
occasion now.&#13;
&#13;
            The second paper is on Operationalizing the WDR&#13;
&#13;
2000/2001.    The WDR 2000/2001, launched in Prague last&#13;
&#13;
September, articulated a broader intellectual framework to&#13;
&#13;
analyze poverty and provided an important intellectual&#13;
&#13;
anchor for the change in the Bank in the last couple of&#13;
&#13;
years.   When we discussed the WDR 2000/2001 with you about&#13;
&#13;
a year ago, we promised you we would come back with a note&#13;
&#13;
on how it would translated into concrete actions, and the&#13;
&#13;
second paper that we are discussing today that promise to&#13;
&#13;
you.&#13;
&#13;
            The two reports cover similar issues, but from&#13;
&#13;
different angles.    The Progress Report looks at the way in&#13;
&#13;
which Bank instruments are changing.          The paper on&#13;
&#13;
Operationalizing the WDR discusses actions the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
taking in the three areas of opportunity, empowerment and&#13;
&#13;
security.    We welcome the opportunity to discuss them&#13;
&#13;
together and, as mentioned by the Chairman of CODE, we&#13;
&#13;
will combine the two into one for public dissemination.&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
            We had a very productive discussion with CODE&#13;
&#13;
last week.    In these opening remarks I want to address&#13;
&#13;
some of the issues that the Chairman of CODE raised, as&#13;
&#13;
well as some of the issues raised in statements by Ms.&#13;
&#13;
O'Leary and Messrs. Alyahya, Meyer and Toure.&#13;
&#13;
            The statements by the CODE Chairman, Ms. O'Leary&#13;
&#13;
and Mr. Toure caution against using a "one-size-fits-all"&#13;
&#13;
approach.    The Bank's Strategic Framework and business&#13;
&#13;
models really do move away from such an approach, in line&#13;
&#13;
with the WDR, which did not propose one recipe that would&#13;
&#13;
fit all countries.    The Strategic Framework and country&#13;
&#13;
business models recognize the critical importance of&#13;
&#13;
ownership for effective implementation and the importance&#13;
&#13;
of in-depth country knowledge as the basis on which to&#13;
&#13;
elaborate strategies.&#13;
&#13;
            For low-income countries, we are applying this&#13;
&#13;
into the PRSP approach represents the key tool to support&#13;
&#13;
country ownership and to operationalize the WDR.&#13;
&#13;
            The discussion at CODE and the written&#13;
&#13;
statements highlight the importance of good monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
evaluation systems.    Good M&amp;E systems and capacity are&#13;
&#13;
clearly essential to establish whether progress is being&#13;
&#13;
made.   This is a challenging area:        capacity is weak in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
many countries; the sustainability of systems set up by&#13;
&#13;
donors set up by donors is often in question; and the&#13;
&#13;
reports indicate that M&amp;E is an area where even the Bank&#13;
&#13;
needs to make progress.&#13;
&#13;
            Ms. O'Leary asked specifically what the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
doing to supply demand-driven M&amp;E strengthening.           The main&#13;
&#13;
vehicle for our support is really our operational work --&#13;
&#13;
projects, technical assistance, ESW, and the work that WBI&#13;
&#13;
is doing.&#13;
&#13;
            I would like to cite just a couple of examples.&#13;
&#13;
In Tanzania we are working very closely with the&#13;
&#13;
authorities to strengthen the poverty monitoring system in&#13;
&#13;
the context of the PRSP.     We are also working closely with&#13;
&#13;
UNDP.&#13;
&#13;
            In Ethiopia, we are doing the same in and here&#13;
&#13;
in partnership with DFID.      We are strengthening the&#13;
&#13;
central statistical authority and the welfare monitoring&#13;
&#13;
units capacity to analyze the data.         This work is not&#13;
&#13;
limited to PRSP countries.      Just to give one example.       We&#13;
&#13;
are working closely with the Indian authorities, both at&#13;
&#13;
the central and at the state level on their data, as well&#13;
&#13;
as their poverty monitoring systems.&#13;

&#13;
            We have also initiated activities in eight pilot&#13;
&#13;
countries under the M&amp;E Improvement Program led by OPCS,&#13;
&#13;
and we have developed guidance in the Poverty Reduction&#13;
&#13;
Sourcebook on monitoring and evaluation and on data&#13;
&#13;
analysis.&#13;
&#13;
            These resources are now available on the web,&#13;
&#13;
and we would be happy to discuss them further if there is&#13;
&#13;
interest, as suggested by Mr. Meyer.&#13;
&#13;
            In-country demand is really a key to ensure any,&#13;
&#13;
and we are working on this.      And I will only cite just one&#13;
&#13;
example, which is the workshops that WBI has been&#13;
&#13;
organizing with policymakers to show with practical&#13;
&#13;
examples how better data and better analysis can lead to&#13;
&#13;
better decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
            We propose to reallocate resources now used for&#13;
&#13;
the tracking of PTIs which really is just an input measure&#13;
&#13;
to country-level and global M&amp;E work which will give us a&#13;
&#13;
sense for what is happening on the ground in terms of&#13;
&#13;
outcomes and impacts.     We want also to work to develop&#13;
&#13;
rigorous indicators of the areas of poverty that the WDR&#13;
&#13;
brought forward on which we haven't worked so much so far,&#13;
&#13;
namely empowerment and security.&#13;

&#13;
         We want to report back to you on progress in&#13;
&#13;
this area in the next progress report.        By then, we will&#13;
&#13;
have a better sense for where there are data and where&#13;
&#13;
there are not on all the various dimensions of poverty,&#13;
&#13;
and we will report on lessons learned.&#13;
&#13;
         I think it is important to stress a point that&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Alyahya made, which is that progress in achieving the&#13;
&#13;
IDGs really is the result of joint efforts by all partners&#13;
&#13;
concerned involved -- the government, the private sector,&#13;
&#13;
civil society and the donors.     So in our work to see what&#13;
&#13;
has happened in countries, we should really keep in mind&#13;
&#13;
that we are working in partnership with others.&#13;
&#13;
         One of the issues raised by the statement by the&#13;
&#13;
CODE Chairman is the issue of accountability.&#13;
&#13;
Accountability for monitoring progress at the country&#13;
&#13;
level rests squarely with the Country Directors.         The role&#13;
&#13;
of the Poverty Board and other thematic and sector boards&#13;
&#13;
is in reporting progress globally, ensuring quality and,&#13;
&#13;
importantly, enhancing the quality and the skills of staff&#13;
&#13;
so that they can better play their role.&#13;
&#13;
         Looking ahead, there are some key areas where we&#13;
&#13;
want to focus our efforts.    To help countries formulate&#13;
&#13;
better poverty reduction strategies, we need to deepen our&#13;

&#13;
analytical work on poverty.     Questions were raised at the&#13;
&#13;
CODE meeting and in the statements by Mr. Meyer and Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Toure on the resource implications of doing more&#13;
&#13;
analytical work and on the need to rationalize our ESW&#13;
&#13;
program.   This was discussed yesterday with the Budget&#13;
&#13;
Committee, and, as was indicated, management is preparing&#13;
&#13;
an ESW implementation note which will come to the EDs&#13;
&#13;
before the end of June.&#13;
&#13;
           To enhance opportunities, we will continue to&#13;
&#13;
focus on the promotion of growth, but we will be paying&#13;
&#13;
more attention to the institutional underpinnings of&#13;
&#13;
growth and to the distributional consequences of different&#13;
&#13;
growth paths.   As stressed in statements by Mr. Stek, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Meyer and Ms. O'Leary, we will carry out more systematic&#13;
&#13;
analysis of the poverty impact of Bank operations, as well&#13;
&#13;
as more work on pro-poor growth.&#13;
&#13;
           The Bank is also rethinking its strategy for&#13;
&#13;
rural development, which is crucial for poverty reduction,&#13;
&#13;
as the majority of poor people live in rural areas.          At&#13;
&#13;
the CODE discussion, management noted that much has been&#13;
&#13;
done to support rural development not just through&#13;
&#13;
agricultural lending but also through lending in other&#13;
&#13;
sectors such as health or education.&#13;

          Mr. Csaki from the Rural Development family is&#13;
&#13;
here today and he can answer any further questions on the&#13;
&#13;
rural strategy.&#13;
&#13;
          There has been a discussion at the CODE meeting&#13;
&#13;
on empowerment.   We will work to enhance inclusion and&#13;
&#13;
participation in Bank work, strengthen local&#13;
&#13;
organizational capacity and accountability and enhance&#13;
&#13;
access to information.    As mentioned, a guidance note to&#13;
&#13;
staff is being prepared.    The note will define what&#13;
&#13;
empowerment means and what the Bank's mandate in this area&#13;
&#13;
is.   It will be discussed within the Bank broadly and will&#13;
&#13;
be ready some time in the fall.&#13;
&#13;
          Deepa Narayan is here and she can answer&#13;
&#13;
questions on this if there are any further questions.&#13;
&#13;
          On CDD, on community-driven development, as&#13;
&#13;
mentioned at the CODE meeting, management will be&#13;
&#13;
reporting separately to the Board and July Edstrom and&#13;
&#13;
Philippe Dongier are here if there are questions today.&#13;
&#13;
          To enhance the security, we will work more&#13;
&#13;
systematically to implement the social risk management&#13;
&#13;
framework at the country level and continue to work on&#13;
&#13;
prevention and mitigation of conflict and disaster.          These&#13;
&#13;
are very important points that have been raised by Mr.&#13;

Toure in regards to the situation of many conflict&#13;
&#13;
countries.   Robert Holzmann and Judy Edstrom are here and&#13;
&#13;
can answer further questions on this.&#13;
&#13;
         In terms of how we work, the challenge ahead is&#13;
&#13;
to improve the way we work across sectoral boundaries and&#13;
&#13;
how we integrate cross-cutting themes and sectoral&#13;
&#13;
strategies into the work we do at the country level.          We&#13;
&#13;
need to do a better job at that, and we will be reporting&#13;
&#13;
on progress next year.&#13;
&#13;
         In closing, we would like to thank again CODE&#13;
&#13;
for a very productive discussion, as well as the EDs who&#13;
&#13;
provided written statements.      These comments were very&#13;
&#13;
useful and we look forward to a productive discussion&#13;

today.&#13;

         We welcome these two reports and commend staff&#13;

&#13;
         Our comments today will be selective and mostly&#13;
&#13;
on operationalizing the WDR.     It is very difficult to&#13;
&#13;
disagree with the intent of the report to pay more&#13;
&#13;
attention to the distributional aspect of growth.&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, this has been an area which the Bank has&#13;
&#13;
not paid enough attention to, particularly in its&#13;
&#13;
analytical work and where it does indeed have a&#13;
&#13;
comparative advantage.&#13;
&#13;
         Where we still have difficulty is with the&#13;
&#13;
empowerment pillar.   The report admits that this is the&#13;
&#13;
most challenging part of the WDR, both in terms of&#13;
&#13;
defining what it means in an operational context and in&#13;
&#13;
delineating the Bank's appropriate role.&#13;
&#13;
         Indeed, this is evident, given that the Bank has&#13;
&#13;
spent three years in worldwide consultations and reviews&#13;
&#13;
on this subject and we still are not sure what to do with&#13;
&#13;
it exactly.&#13;
&#13;
         We remain unconvinced of the analytical&#13;
&#13;
underpinning of this pillar, and have not seen historical&#13;
&#13;
evidence yet that the kind of empowerment the WDR is&#13;
&#13;
talking about has led to economic development per se.&#13;
&#13;
Indeed, as former Secretary of Treasury and former Chief&#13;
&#13;
Economist of the Bank, Laurence Summers, recently said,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
the evidence is the other way around.          he adds the&#13;
&#13;
suggestion that there would be a generalized improvement&#13;
&#13;
in decision-making processes by giving more weight to&#13;
&#13;
local communities is a proposition for which there is very&#13;
&#13;
little evidence.   In this regard, we are surprised that&#13;
&#13;
this pillar continues to be mentioned as one of the key&#13;
&#13;
corporate advocacy priorities of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           Furthermore, the budget paper and the SDP claim&#13;
&#13;
that the Bank is qualified to play a leading role in this&#13;
&#13;
area.    We simply do not see this, at least not yet.&#13;
&#13;
           We would also like to see more hard analytical&#13;
&#13;
evidence on CDD community-driven development.           In&#13;
&#13;
particular, we would like to see evidence on the links&#13;
&#13;
between economic growth and CDD as an approach.           On the&#13;
&#13;
face of it, it is logical that there are local benefits,&#13;
&#13;
but do these benefits translate into sustainable country-&#13;
&#13;
wide benefits?   Does CDD reduce corruption?          What are its&#13;
&#13;
limitations?   Are there certain factors that need to be in&#13;
&#13;
place for this approach to work?&#13;
&#13;
           We hope the Bank will work on getting more of&#13;
&#13;
this evidence before expanding the approach across the&#13;
&#13;
board.&#13;
&#13;

          MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
          Mr. Abraham.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. ABRAHAM:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
          I welcome very much the discussion by the full&#13;
&#13;
Board of this important document.       We have had the chance&#13;
&#13;
to make our statement in detail during the CODE meeting.&#13;
&#13;
And I would also like to fully endorse Chairman Stek's&#13;
&#13;
statement on that meeting.&#13;
&#13;
          But given the importance that our chair attaches&#13;
&#13;
to this issue, I would like to make a few brief remarks.&#13;
&#13;
          The first one is the fact that we still have&#13;
&#13;
unpleasant statistics in this area.        As the document&#13;
&#13;
underlines, poverty remains very deep and widespread and&#13;
&#13;
the struggle to survive continues to be very hard for&#13;
&#13;
millions of people around the world.        But, in particular,&#13;
&#13;
the number of the poor have even increased in Sub-Saharan&#13;
&#13;
Africa, in South Asia with both regions accounting for the&#13;
&#13;
largest proportion of people living under one dollar a&#13;
&#13;
day.   Similarly, progress on the IDG has been slower in&#13;
&#13;
South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
&#13;
          However, these two regions which account for 70&#13;
&#13;
percent of the world's poor received less than 25 percent&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank Group's lending in the period 1995 through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
2000.   I think clearly this position in resource&#13;
&#13;
utilization fails to reflect the Bank's mission statement&#13;
&#13;
on poverty reduction and the international development&#13;
&#13;
goals of significantly reducing poverty by the year 2015.&#13;
&#13;
           The second is the plight of the middle-income&#13;
&#13;
countries.   In the context of global capital flows, it&#13;
&#13;
needs to be taken seriously in addressing poverty issues.&#13;
&#13;
We believe it is common knowledge that the middle-income&#13;
&#13;
countries are home to many of the world's poorest and&#13;
&#13;
their access to concessional lending is low.          However, it&#13;
&#13;
is also a fact that most of the global flows which tend to&#13;
&#13;
spin economic activities in the MICs got to only ten&#13;
&#13;
countries.   Thus, the challenge for the Bank is not only&#13;
&#13;
to ensure that appropriate concessional funding is secured&#13;
&#13;
for poverty reduction in the near term but also to assist&#13;
&#13;
the middle-income countries' access, the global financial&#13;
&#13;
markets for more proper development activities. The third&#13;
&#13;
is on the issue of rural development.         I was very pleased&#13;
&#13;
to hear management stating that they are rethinking their&#13;
&#13;
rural development strategy.     You cannot help but think&#13;
&#13;
about poverty when you talk about the rural agrarian&#13;
&#13;
economy.   However, a clear Bank policy on this area is yet&#13;
&#13;
to come out.   Rural poverty has its many dimensions, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
the one most commonly singled out is of a skewed asset&#13;
&#13;
distribution.&#13;
&#13;
          The most predominant economic activity in rural&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia countries continues to&#13;
&#13;
be agriculture.   However, asset ownership and particularly&#13;
&#13;
land, that of land remains quite complex in both regions.&#13;
&#13;
This underscores the need for a clear understanding of&#13;
&#13;
land ownership and distribution and how it impacts upon&#13;
&#13;
agricultural production and income.&#13;
&#13;
          We, therefore, believe that analytical work on&#13;
&#13;
rural poverty should include the issue of land ownership&#13;
&#13;
and distribution.    Furthermore, the Bank needs to do more&#13;
&#13;
on the issue of poverty reduction in the context of trade&#13;
&#13;
barriers to agricultural production from developing&#13;
&#13;
countries, which directly impact the incomes of&#13;
&#13;
agricultural producers.&#13;
&#13;
          Fourth, we are very much encouraged by the&#13;
&#13;
proposed next steps laid out by management in the progress&#13;
&#13;
report.   We would, however, like to see more Bank work on&#13;
&#13;
the linkages of poverty and population growth, a point&#13;
&#13;
that has been very much emphasized by CODE's Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
          Furthermore, we would be interested in knowing&#13;
&#13;
how the Bank's decentralization process, especially with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
respect to sector specialists at the country level, can&#13;
&#13;
enhance the new poverty approach.&#13;
&#13;
         Fifth, we welcome the efforts to operationalize&#13;
&#13;
the WDR 2000/01, which emphasizes that poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
will require simultaneously the perceived objectives of&#13;
&#13;
increasing opportunities, enhancing empowerment and&#13;
&#13;
strengthening security among the poor.        And here we very&#13;
&#13;
much like to echo also the sentiments that were just made&#13;
&#13;
by Mr. Al-Saad as far as which one comes first,&#13;
&#13;
empowerment or economic growth.      It is a very important&#13;
&#13;
issue and that is something that we should pay attention&#13;
&#13;
to.&#13;
&#13;
         The WDR has become the Bank's flag post&#13;
&#13;
publication on development not to our development partners&#13;
&#13;
but also to our member governments and the academic world.&#13;
&#13;
The participatory approach it embraces in the preparation&#13;
&#13;
also makes it widely accepted in different circles.         We,&#13;
&#13;
therefore, strongly endorse the operationalization of the&#13;
&#13;
WDR 2000/01 in the Bank's poverty work.&#13;
&#13;
         Finally, Mr. Chairman, we would very much like&#13;
&#13;
to thank the authors of the two documents for a clear and&#13;
&#13;
succinct presentation of the full range of issues in cases&#13;
&#13;
involving poverty and how we might best attack it.&#13;

&#13;
           Mr. Peeters.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PEETERS:   We welcome this update on the&#13;
&#13;
Bank progress in implementing its core mandate of poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction.   We agree with the two management's proposals&#13;
&#13;
to combine the two reports and to abandon the category of&#13;
&#13;
poverty targeted investments.&#13;
&#13;
           We also welcome the Bank's general intention to&#13;
&#13;
carry out more of its economic and sector work in a fully&#13;
&#13;
sustainable way, particularly in partnership with local&#13;
&#13;
institutions.    More in particular, with respect to&#13;
&#13;
improving the understanding of poverty as a basis for&#13;
&#13;
action, we would have preferred more stress on&#13;
&#13;
partnerships with other donors and research institutions.&#13;
&#13;
We think that there is a huge reserve of expertise that&#13;
&#13;
can be tapped.&#13;
&#13;
           As to strengthening the social and poverty&#13;
&#13;
impact analysis underpinning the Bank's operations, we&#13;
&#13;
find it a bit striking that such basic analyses, ex ante&#13;
&#13;
as well as ex post, are still not implemented as a&#13;
&#13;
standard in the Bank after twenty years of structural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
adjustment lending and ten years after the 1990 WDR Report&#13;
&#13;
on Poverty.&#13;
&#13;
         On PRSPs, we would like to point out that&#13;
&#13;
concepts such as ownership, participation and national&#13;
&#13;
strategy may be, in fact, put into practice very&#13;
&#13;
differently from what the Bank has meant in the origin,&#13;
&#13;
particularly given low-income countries' limited capacity&#13;
&#13;
and the nature of their political system.&#13;
&#13;
         While the progress paper notes that signs are&#13;
&#13;
that real changes are taking place, we think that&#13;
&#13;
expectations in poverty reduction policies in the short-&#13;
&#13;
term should be somewhat lower.       Besides, we think that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's role in this process is still one of walking a&#13;
&#13;
tightrope.    Such a role in our view may not always promote&#13;
&#13;
ownership.&#13;
&#13;
         In this respect, we think that the main feature&#13;
&#13;
of PRSPs is not that it draws upon PRSPs but that more&#13;
&#13;
than in previous adjustment lending operations, it is&#13;
&#13;
programmatic, reduces the transaction costs of providing&#13;
&#13;
aid and improves ownership and public finance management.&#13;
&#13;
         On governance, we think that the main&#13;
&#13;
contribution of the 1990s to the poverty debate has been&#13;
&#13;
the generalized awareness of good governance as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
necessary, but insufficient, condition for poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction.&#13;
&#13;
            In our view, good governance and solid public&#13;
&#13;
financial management are indispensable intermediate goals&#13;
&#13;
on the way to poverty reduction.         We, therefore, welcome&#13;
&#13;
the forthcoming rebuilding of the Bank's diagnostic in&#13;
&#13;
economic and sector work in this area.&#13;
&#13;
            This should also better ensure the success of&#13;
&#13;
the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in terms of increasing&#13;
&#13;
poverty-related expenditures.        Further on this point, we&#13;
&#13;
would suggest the forthcoming staff guidance paper on&#13;
&#13;
empowerment to deal with the issue of building ownership&#13;
&#13;
for solid public finance management.&#13;
&#13;
            On environment, we would like to underline that&#13;
&#13;
environmental protection and poverty reduction are not&#13;
&#13;
exactly the same.    And we are afraid that the pro-poor&#13;
&#13;
redesigning of some of the Bank's environmental lending&#13;
&#13;
has turned this lending in health and water sector&#13;
&#13;
lending.    The Bank's work in the area of environmental&#13;
&#13;
protection should not be understood in a human centered&#13;
&#13;
way only.    In the end, all environmental protection is&#13;
&#13;
pro-poor, as particularly the poor ultimately depend on&#13;
&#13;
the environment for opportunities and their security.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
And, therefore, we would like to suggest that immediate&#13;
&#13;
poverty reduction should not be the objective of all&#13;
&#13;
strategic papers and in particular not of the&#13;
&#13;
environmental strategic paper.&#13;
&#13;
           On the Bank's culture, we are concerned that&#13;
&#13;
long after the Bank has adopted poverty reduction in its&#13;
&#13;
mission, there is still a large apparent need for the Bank&#13;
&#13;
staff to change its view towards a more pro-poor attitude.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, we are pleased that this paper is candid&#13;
&#13;
about this critical precondition.&#13;
&#13;
           In this respect, we see a continued&#13;
&#13;
decentralization of the Bank as an important part of the&#13;
&#13;
requisite incentives for needed behavioral and cultural&#13;
&#13;
changes.   But we think also that the Bank should integrate&#13;
&#13;
this concern about attitude in its recruitment policy too.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:   Thank you very much, Mr.&#13;

&#13;
           MR. ZHU:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           Like others, we also commend staff for their&#13;
&#13;
hard work in preparing these two reports and appreciate&#13;
&#13;
the CODE Chairman's statement.      We absolutely agree that&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
the central role of our mission is poverty reduction and&#13;
&#13;
agree also to focusing on income alone is not enough,&#13;
&#13;
either for understanding of the meaning of poverty or of&#13;
&#13;
the construction of policies to fight it.&#13;
&#13;
         However, we think some key points reached by the&#13;
&#13;
World Development Report last year and reemphasized by the&#13;
&#13;
two reports should be discussed continually in&#13;
&#13;
particularly defining poverty as consisting broadly-&#13;
&#13;
speaking of three key features of lives of people that is:&#13;
&#13;
first, lack of opportunity to participate in and&#13;
&#13;
contribute to economic growth and development; second,&#13;
&#13;
powerlessness over key decisions that affect their living;&#13;
&#13;
and third, vulnerability to economic and other         shocks&#13;
&#13;
such as disease or injury, crop failures and macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
recessions.&#13;
&#13;
         Based on the above concept, the paper on&#13;
&#13;
Operationalizing the WDR 2000/01 of the World Bank puts on&#13;
&#13;
some judgments and suggestions on the table, which include&#13;
&#13;
we will pay more attention to the country and&#13;
&#13;
institutional underpinnings of growth-oriented policies&#13;
&#13;
and to the distributional aspects of growth.         The Bank is&#13;
&#13;
producing a staff guidance paper on empowerment.         The&#13;
&#13;
guidance paper is expected to clarify concepts, outline&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
key areas for support, including entry point for action&#13;
&#13;
and good practice.&#13;
&#13;
          Risks and vulnerability are particularly&#13;
&#13;
important drivers of poverty in many of the Bank's middle-&#13;
&#13;
income country clients.    I would like to make my comments&#13;
&#13;
around the issues mentioned above.&#13;
&#13;
          Economically, poverty should have as its nature&#13;
&#13;
which basically is no food, no clothes for people's&#13;
&#13;
living.   How to evaluate poverty and how to measure the&#13;
&#13;
performance of poverty reduction?       Income is a very&#13;
&#13;
important indicator, although it stands alone; it is not&#13;
&#13;
enough.&#13;
&#13;
          Otherwise, we couldn't estimate how many poor&#13;
&#13;
people have gotten rid of poverty in the last decade,&#13;
&#13;
particularly in the last five years, the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
contribution to the global poverty reduction.          And how&#13;
&#13;
many people still worldwide live under the poverty line?&#13;
&#13;
The international development goals are also expressed in&#13;
&#13;
the indicators.   Without those specific indicators,&#13;
&#13;
poverty reduction will lose clear targets.&#13;
&#13;
          In this connection, I also would like to&#13;
&#13;
emphasize that talking about quality of poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
should be based on the quantitative achievement we have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
reached in the field of poverty reduction, which is&#13;
&#13;
demonstrated by people having enough food to eat, having&#13;
&#13;
clean water to drink, having clothes to wear.          Without&#13;
&#13;
those fundamental material bases, just talking about&#13;
&#13;
empowerment is an empty promise most of the times.&#13;
&#13;
         Now any substantial help to poor people's living&#13;
&#13;
standard improvement more seriously is that, which will&#13;
&#13;
become the cause of instability if we couldn't deal with&#13;
&#13;
the problem well and, finally result in a negative impact&#13;
&#13;
on the poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
         Because of these reasons, I strongly suggest&#13;
&#13;
that the proposed guidance paper should be prepared very&#13;
&#13;
carefully.   Areas to be clarified must fully fall within&#13;
&#13;
our institution's mandate and comparative advantage.&#13;
&#13;
         All in all, there is only one purpose, which is&#13;
&#13;
to benefit poor people, improving their living standards.&#13;
&#13;
In order to realize the target, we must keep sustainable&#13;
&#13;
economic growth in line with the country's reality and&#13;
&#13;
deal with the relationship between growth and fair&#13;
&#13;
distribution.&#13;
&#13;
         Particularly for the countries which are&#13;
&#13;
transforming from the planned economy to market-oriented&#13;
&#13;
economy must pay attention to the order and extent of the&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
report and concentrate their efforts on growth.         Some&#13;
&#13;
principles should be emphasized which include:         let people&#13;
&#13;
see the tangible results of reforms, which brings economic&#13;
&#13;
growth and benefits to poor people as quickly as possible;&#13;
&#13;
therefore, to mobilize more people to support reform;&#13;
&#13;
taking advantage of opportunity of growth, like a portion&#13;
&#13;
of people become rich first, which is a good demonstration&#13;
&#13;
to show the advantages of reform and strengthening the&#13;
&#13;
confidence of people to further reform.                 After&#13;
&#13;
some developments have been made, the relative region and&#13;
&#13;
people should be encouraged to support the region and&#13;
&#13;
people still living under the poverty line.         And such kind&#13;
&#13;
of help should focus on development, production and&#13;
&#13;
enhancing the productivity of the poor rather than on only&#13;
&#13;
relieving.&#13;
&#13;
         Given the starting point of reform in some&#13;
&#13;
transition economies, few individual incentives and very&#13;
&#13;
equal income distribution, some income inequality is not&#13;
&#13;
only inevitable but also desirable in a certain period of&#13;
&#13;
the reform process, as it provides economic incentives&#13;
&#13;
necessary for much of the growth.      Nevertheless, it is&#13;
&#13;
useful to understand how the inequality emerged as a basis&#13;
&#13;
to understand the process of growth.&#13;

&#13;
            I agree that the fair distributional aspect of&#13;
&#13;
growth is an important too, but in my view the first step&#13;
&#13;
is to make sure that the growth is to make a cake bigger&#13;
&#13;
and bigger.    Like more and more incremental portion of the&#13;
&#13;
cake can be distributed, then to take every effort to deal&#13;
&#13;
well with the issue of fair distribution.&#13;
&#13;
            Here I would like to quote a modern Chinese&#13;
&#13;
saying:   Only development is the real stuff.&#13;
&#13;
            In conclusion, I have a very strong reservation&#13;
&#13;
on combining these two reports into one for dissemination&#13;
&#13;
because of the different nature of these two reports and&#13;
&#13;
many unclear issues.    It is too early to combine those&#13;
&#13;
into one.&#13;
&#13;
            However, if the majority of the Board members&#13;
&#13;
agree with the proposal, I strongly suggest staff try&#13;
&#13;
their best to deal with unclear issues and make a&#13;
&#13;
distinction between the research paper and the Bank's&#13;

operational guidance.&#13;

&#13;
         I will confine my remarks to just two aspects.&#13;
&#13;
I think the documents are excellent.        They cover most of&#13;
&#13;
the necessary policies, strategies and instruments that&#13;
&#13;
are required to achieve the goals of the report.&#13;
&#13;
         I will go just to the point where how can we be&#13;
&#13;
effective?   In economics we are there already.         We have no&#13;
&#13;
problems about the analysis of the supply, analysis of&#13;
&#13;
demand, although I feel that stress should go more on&#13;
&#13;
analyzing the sources of growth and then we look at the&#13;
&#13;
distributional aspect and tackle the poverty so that the&#13;
&#13;
eradication of poverty becomes more sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
         I always viewed HIPC as a one-shot solution that&#13;
&#13;
is interim in nature but needs to go beyond and identify&#13;
&#13;
what are the sources of growth and how can we create&#13;
&#13;
supplies with which the economy and the people can come&#13;
&#13;
out of the poverty syndrome and then look at the demand&#13;
&#13;
aspect and how these products can reach the markets and&#13;
&#13;
then we can take in the various fora, whether here or the&#13;
&#13;
WTO especially, that access will help the countries come&#13;
&#13;
out of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
         My main point is with all this economics, I&#13;
&#13;
still cannot move.   In my own constituency, the political&#13;
&#13;
economy becomes important.     The politics of trying to move&#13;

&#13;
keeps me ineffective here.     As a Board member, I only&#13;
&#13;
reflected back to my constituency three times -- once,&#13;
&#13;
whether they wanted to participate in IDA; once whether&#13;
&#13;
they wanted to contribute to the Digital Alliance; and&#13;
&#13;
once on the selection process of the President.           Other&#13;
&#13;
than that, I am independent here.       I give my own views; I&#13;
&#13;
give whatever I think is appropriate to the best of my&#13;
&#13;
ability and, if I am not considered appropriate, then my&#13;
&#13;
governments can pull me out.      I put myself on the line.&#13;
&#13;
           My main concern is I have countries in my&#13;
&#13;
constituency where I cannot move.       Whenever I mention&#13;
&#13;
about certain countries, there will be no response.           I&#13;
&#13;
talk with the officers, the staff and they are waiting for&#13;
&#13;
the go ahead.   And other countries not in my constituency&#13;
&#13;
watch that.&#13;
&#13;
           The politics can just go beyond economics. And&#13;
&#13;
here, we are talking about poor people.            You win the poor&#13;
&#13;
people, you win the government.       And to stay engaged with&#13;
&#13;
these countries -- countries like Myanmar in my&#13;
&#13;
constituency -- this is the way for you to win the&#13;
&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
           To boycott, as requested by some people inside&#13;
&#13;
Myanmar itself is the wrong way to go.         I think the World&#13;

Bank, the Board of Directors must be above all these&#13;
&#13;
politics.    We should discuss the economics of it and leave&#13;
&#13;
to the political masters whatever decisions they want&#13;
&#13;
themselves to overrule, but not to come upfront and we&#13;
&#13;
just pour cold water on whatever comes up.&#13;
&#13;
            I will not go into the details of this report&#13;
&#13;
because I think CODE has shown enough experience and&#13;
&#13;
aspects on this.    This is a subject I have been involved&#13;
&#13;
in through the 1960s, through the 1980s and 1990s in my&#13;
&#13;
study in this field.     And I don't think I have got any&#13;
&#13;
quarrel with all the studies.       I just want to move ahead.&#13;
&#13;
            Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. WOLFENSOHN:   The question of dealing with&#13;
&#13;
poverty outside the framework of politics, that is, of&#13;
&#13;
course, a very difficult question for this Board and for&#13;
&#13;
management because on the issues of where we deal and what&#13;
&#13;
we will get approval for is not always, as you know, just&#13;
&#13;
a question of finding poor people.         It is a question of&#13;
&#13;
getting the political will of this Board to allow this&#13;
&#13;
instrumentality of the shareholders to proceed.           And it&#13;
&#13;
may be something that the Board would like to take up at&#13;
&#13;
some time, but typically what we do is we try to read the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
political sentiment of the Board and determine whether or&#13;
&#13;
not it is possible for us to undertake programs.&#13;
&#13;
         We get some pretty clear messages from the Board&#13;
&#13;
on what is possible and what is not.        But if the Board&#13;
&#13;
would like to change it, then I suggest the Board perhaps&#13;
&#13;
comes together and decides on how this balance should be&#13;
&#13;
better maintained.&#13;
&#13;
         In the case of Myanmar, it is fairly clear that&#13;
&#13;
there has been some debate at the political level which&#13;
&#13;
has led us to conclude that at least at this moment&#13;
&#13;
Myanmar is not a likely eventuality.        But if the Board&#13;
&#13;
wishes to take up the political issues separately from the&#13;
&#13;
issue of poverty and give us different guidance,&#13;
&#13;
management would be very happy to engage in that&#13;
&#13;
discussion.   But engaging in a discussion for programs&#13;
&#13;
that we know are going to be killed by the Board is&#13;
&#13;
probably not a very useful exercise.&#13;
&#13;
         But I would be very interested if the Board on&#13;
&#13;
its initiative decides to discuss this.            We will be very&#13;
&#13;
glad to follow-up.   Thank you for your suggestion.&#13;
&#13;
         Mr. Merotto.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. MEROTTO:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
           First, I would like to thank the authors of the&#13;
&#13;
reports for the hard work and for what I thought were&#13;
&#13;
excellent products.   Since most of my points have been&#13;
&#13;
covered in CODE, I can be brief and focus only on the&#13;
&#13;
operationalizing the WDR paper.&#13;
&#13;
           First, I strongly support what the CODE Chairman&#13;
&#13;
said about poverty impact assessment, also with what he&#13;
&#13;
said about empowerment and analytical work and also his&#13;
&#13;
call for a more formal Board discussion of community-&#13;
&#13;
driven development, both the approach and the Bank's role&#13;
&#13;
in that.&#13;
&#13;
           I can also echo what Mr. Peeters said about&#13;
&#13;
public financial management and accountability.          I think&#13;
&#13;
that is a very important point which the paper does bring&#13;
&#13;
out.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, on empowerment, we welcome the attention&#13;
&#13;
given to the issue.   We strongly feel that empowerment is&#13;
&#13;
an issue which like participation needs to be mainstreamed&#13;
&#13;
rather than dealt with through direct support for&#13;
&#13;
communities, for example, through community-driven&#13;
&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
           Third and similarly, we feel security needs to&#13;
&#13;
be mainstreamed in the Bank's work.        It must not be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
marginalized in the same way as safety nets were in the&#13;
&#13;
1990s.   With this in mind, we welcome the regional social&#13;
&#13;
risk management strategy work and the new indicators for&#13;
&#13;
security which we think are important in encouraging&#13;
&#13;
country teams to take risk and vulnerability seriously.&#13;
&#13;
          Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
          Mr. Biskup.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. BISKUP:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
          Mr. Chairman, let me start by thanking staff for&#13;
&#13;
the two comprehensive and well-analyzed documents.          We&#13;
&#13;
very much welcome the efforts undertaken to operationalize&#13;
&#13;
the WDR and we also concur with management's&#13;
&#13;
recommendation to combine the two documents for future&#13;
&#13;
documentation on poverty progress.&#13;
&#13;
          Furthermore, we agree with the nature of&#13;
&#13;
paragraph 30 of the Progress Report, although we come to a&#13;
&#13;
situation where we are so overwhelmed with reporting&#13;
&#13;
instruments that we now have to set up the Bank-wide&#13;
&#13;
working group to streamline them again.&#13;
&#13;
          At the same time, we realize -- and this chair&#13;
&#13;
very much supports any activity in this regard -- that&#13;
&#13;
more efforts are needed to understand the causes of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
poverty.    Comparing the two progress reports from 1990 and&#13;
&#13;
2000-01, we see similarities in sequencing but also some&#13;
&#13;
differences in focus.&#13;
&#13;
            First, the 1999 report is with regard to the&#13;
&#13;
fulfillment of the international development goals more&#13;
&#13;
skeptical and, more important, the problem of distribution&#13;
&#13;
is directly linked to the goals.        I quote, "The target of&#13;
&#13;
halving the incidence of income poverty by 2015 will not&#13;
&#13;
be met if growth is accompanied by increases in inequality&#13;
&#13;
and progress in reducing income poverty has been slow in&#13;
&#13;
the 1990s and there are varying signs of increases in&#13;
&#13;
inequality across and in some cases within countries", end&#13;
&#13;
of quote.&#13;
&#13;
            The 2000/01 puts its emphasis more on good&#13;
&#13;
governance and sound institutions and gives the&#13;
&#13;
recommendation to lend more selectively and on the basis&#13;
&#13;
of reform commitments.     We generally concur with this&#13;
&#13;
approach.    The Bank should put great attention to the&#13;
&#13;
distributional aspect of growth, and it is the quality of&#13;
&#13;
growth that really matters.&#13;
&#13;
            Therefore, we very much welcome paragraph 33 of&#13;
&#13;
the Attacking Poverty paper, especially the establishment&#13;
&#13;
of a joint Bank-Fund team to coordinate the institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
approaches in addressing the issue of distributional&#13;
&#13;
impact analysis.&#13;
&#13;
         In this line, we also see and welcome the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
strong emphasis on empowerment and we are looking forward&#13;
&#13;
to the staff guidance paper.&#13;
&#13;
         Second, the 1999 report highlights on the&#13;
&#13;
significance weaknesses in the area of monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
evaluation.   The same does the 2000/01 report.          We regard&#13;
&#13;
the quality improvement of monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
especially on the country level which obviously includes&#13;
&#13;
capacity building is tremendously important and one of the&#13;
&#13;
major challenges for the Bank in the time to come.&#13;
&#13;
Otherwise, it seems impossible to effectively implement&#13;
&#13;
appropriate approaches to reduce poverty as we have to do&#13;
&#13;
the right things first.&#13;
&#13;
         Third, we welcome the stronger focus on&#13;
&#13;
participatory country poverty work in the 2000/01 report&#13;
&#13;
and that the Bank includes a problem of decentralization&#13;
&#13;
like, for instance, weak capacity in local governance&#13;
&#13;
structures, coordination problems with the central&#13;
&#13;
government and so on in its list of six major challenges&#13;
&#13;
ahead.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
          With regarding to the Attacking Poverty paper, I&#13;
&#13;
want to highlight two final aspects.          First,&#13;
&#13;
unfortunately, the document does not pick up several&#13;
&#13;
topics which form part of the progress report, like, for&#13;
&#13;
instance, agrarian reforms, intellectual property rights&#13;
&#13;
and so on.   With the new reporting structure, we guess&#13;
&#13;
that these missing linkages will be solved.&#13;
&#13;
          Second, the document remains too unspecific&#13;
&#13;
concerning the proposed change in the Bank's culture.               How&#13;
&#13;
will the incentive structures have to look like to reach&#13;
&#13;
the behavioral and cultural change as stated in paragraph&#13;
&#13;
93?   Much remains to be done in this area and also the&#13;
&#13;
problem of an adequate skills mix needs to be addressed&#13;
&#13;
more intensively.&#13;
&#13;
          In addition, under the heading training, we&#13;
&#13;
would appreciate a reference in future reports to the&#13;
&#13;
progress and impact of the grassroots immersion program.&#13;
&#13;
          Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. WOLFENSOHN:      Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
          Mr. Singh.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. SINGH:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
          We clearly welcome this discussion.            We would&#13;
&#13;
like to compliment the staff for these two highly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
analytical and candid reports.      We appreciate the&#13;
&#13;
statement made by the Chairman of CODE which gives&#13;
&#13;
emphasis that we wanted to give as members of CODE about&#13;
&#13;
the implementation of these reports.&#13;
&#13;
         Mr. Chairman, this chair feels that it is a&#13;
&#13;
very, very important decision that we have decided to&#13;
&#13;
operationalize the World Development Report on Poverty.&#13;
&#13;
And I see this as a step forward.       And particularly I feel&#13;
&#13;
that the new emphasis that WDR Report wants us to make in&#13;
&#13;
all of our analytical work in evaluating country-wide&#13;
&#13;
programs from the angle of whether it promotes&#13;
&#13;
opportunity, whether it facilitates empowerment and&#13;
&#13;
whether it enhances security of the poor is very, very&#13;
&#13;
important.&#13;
&#13;
         We would also like to compliment our Chinese&#13;
&#13;
colleague for giving us an interesting analysis as to how&#13;
&#13;
a state-controlled economy tackles the problem of poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction when it moves towards a market-led economy.&#13;
&#13;
         Having said all of this, Mr. Chairman, I have a&#13;
&#13;
few suggestions to make.    One is with regard to our own&#13;
&#13;
lending policy.   This report is silent about a decline in&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank's lending as well as the regional&#13;
&#13;
disparity.   I had suggested in the CODE meeting that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
during the last five year, 1995-2000, South Asia and Sub-&#13;
&#13;
Saharan Africa Regions received only 12 percent and 10&#13;
&#13;
percent, respectively, of the total World Bank's lending,&#13;
&#13;
whereas 43.5 percent and 25 percent of the world's poor&#13;
&#13;
are living in these regions.        Combined together, the&#13;
&#13;
regions represent 70 percent of the world's poor but they&#13;
&#13;
got only 22 percent of the total lending.&#13;
&#13;
         We have been told to make a distinction between&#13;
&#13;
IBRD and IDA but my submission would be that from this&#13;
&#13;
point of view, we should look at the lending in its&#13;
&#13;
totality and we should not look at IDA figures alone.&#13;
&#13;
         We consider this important because if the&#13;
&#13;
international development goals are to be achieved, this&#13;
&#13;
trend has to be reversed.&#13;
&#13;
         My second point, Mr. Chairman, is with regard to&#13;
&#13;
investment again.    And e found that investment lending to&#13;
&#13;
agriculture, minor irrigation, water,system, rural roads&#13;
&#13;
have declined and there is need to reverse this trend.&#13;
&#13;
And, of course, this will be a matter for the rural&#13;
&#13;
development strategy to look at.         But I thought this is&#13;
&#13;
the opportunity to make this point as well.&#13;
&#13;
         My next point is with regard to empowerment.&#13;
&#13;
And I personally feel, Mr. Chairman, that both from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
angle of poverty reduction and also from the angle of&#13;
&#13;
sustainable development, empowerment of women is&#13;
&#13;
particularly important.     I have had the occasion to watch&#13;
&#13;
on the media only the other day about a very fascinating&#13;
&#13;
episode.    I thought I would narrate that to lighten the&#13;
&#13;
seriousness of the debate.      And this is about a village in&#13;
&#13;
Chatiscas [phonetic] Estate of India in Madhra Pradesh&#13;
&#13;
that the women were required to bring water from three&#13;
&#13;
kilometers.    And over the years, the boys were not getting&#13;
&#13;
married because nobody would like to give their daughters&#13;
&#13;
to the young boys of this village.         And this led to that&#13;
&#13;
soul-searching.    And I am now told that they have a&#13;
&#13;
credible water supply system they were remaining without&#13;
&#13;
marriage.&#13;
&#13;
            What I am trying to emphasize is that&#13;
&#13;
empowerment of women is very important.             And there certain&#13;
&#13;
political reservations that India has provided could be of&#13;
&#13;
some relevance.    But I had said it on another occasion&#13;
&#13;
that the crucial thing is if it is possible for the Bank&#13;
&#13;
to evaluate, whether a lady in the rural countryside has a&#13;
&#13;
bank account or a post office account.          That is very&#13;
&#13;
crucial.&#13;

&#13;
         And we thought that these small things go a long&#13;
&#13;
way in empowerment.&#13;
&#13;
         My next point is with regard to the community-&#13;
&#13;
driven development.    And there, I thought that one of the&#13;
&#13;
ways to evaluate our analytical work would be what role&#13;
&#13;
communities have in management of schools; what role do&#13;
&#13;
they play in community-controlled forests, because that is&#13;
&#13;
a common thing, and also the role that the women, in&#13;
&#13;
particular, would play with regard to the health sector.&#13;
&#13;
And we have highly successful schemes in some parts of&#13;
&#13;
South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
         My next point, Mr. Chairman, is something needs&#13;
&#13;
to be discussed and it may be that it requires a separate&#13;
&#13;
discussion.   And that is with regard to the resources in&#13;
&#13;
terms of international development goals.          If the poverty&#13;
&#13;
has to be halved by 2015, what kind of resources we are&#13;
&#13;
making available to the developing countries?          And this&#13;
&#13;
would require a separate analysis.&#13;
&#13;
         But I do see that the papers and also the WDR&#13;
&#13;
Report raises these vital questions.&#13;
&#13;
         Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. WOLFENSOHN:     Thank you, Mr. Singh.&#13;

&#13;
          MR. MOULIN:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
          I will be brief because we benefited from a very&#13;
&#13;
interesting discussion in CODE and statements by our&#13;
&#13;
colleagues.   I just wanted at the outset to thank staff&#13;
&#13;
for the two very good reports we have in front of us.&#13;
&#13;
          On the general comments, we believe that the WDR&#13;
&#13;
2000/01 is a building block of the strategy of the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
its fight against poverty, and we think that we should&#13;
&#13;
take into account in our strategy all the very good&#13;
&#13;
information that is included in this WDR.&#13;
&#13;
          We believe that the three pillars are equality&#13;
&#13;
important -- opportunity, security and empowerment.          And&#13;
&#13;
we believe that the Bank has to translate the WDR strategy&#13;
&#13;
with its three dimensions.&#13;
&#13;
          We think that the Bank will have to pay&#13;
&#13;
particular attention to what is new in this WDR approach.&#13;
&#13;
Regarding the role of growth, I think there are two&#13;
&#13;
issues.   And we welcome very much the steps taken by the&#13;
&#13;
Bank on this subject, and that is promoting the investment&#13;
&#13;
climate because we know that at the end of the day growth&#13;
&#13;
will come from the private sector.        And we have seen how&#13;
&#13;
difficulty it is to promote the private sector in a&#13;
&#13;
developing countries; it is an obstacle to growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         And the second issue is the distributional&#13;
&#13;
aspects of growth to quality of growth, the reduction of&#13;
&#13;
inequalities.   We very much welcome what is in the reports&#13;
&#13;
on this subject.   We think that it should be a core part&#13;
&#13;
of the work of the Bank, especially we believe in our&#13;
&#13;
middle-income countries strategy.&#13;
&#13;
         We also share the view of our colleagues on&#13;
&#13;
poverty impact and poverty assessment, especially on&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending operations.&#13;
&#13;
         On empowerment, this is the newest dimension of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's strategy against poverty.         We strongly feel&#13;
&#13;
that there is a clear link between empowerment and&#13;
&#13;
development, and the title of Amatya Sen's book,&#13;
&#13;
"Development is Freedom" summarizes this approach.&#13;
&#13;
         The operationalization of this concept appears&#13;
&#13;
to be more challenging than the two other pillars.           But we&#13;
&#13;
think that we shouldn't be afraid by the novelty of this&#13;
&#13;
notion, and we should not delay our commitment towards its&#13;
&#13;
implementation in the work of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
         In particular, we think we should not maybe try&#13;
&#13;
to spend too much time on trying to find a university&#13;
&#13;
accepted definition of empowerment because this might take&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
a long time.    Even the translation of the word in some&#13;
&#13;
languages might take even a longer time.&#13;
&#13;
         So we have the feeling that we all know broadly&#13;
&#13;
what it means.   So we should strike the right balance&#13;
&#13;
between analytical work and taking action now to promote&#13;
&#13;
empowerment of the poor while respecting the specific&#13;
&#13;
context of each country.&#13;
&#13;
         I have two more specific comments on the report,&#13;
&#13;
two or three.    We support Bassary Toure's request for a&#13;
&#13;
translation in French with obviously the caveat that I&#13;
&#13;
wish you luck to translate empowerment.             And we support&#13;
&#13;
also what Bassary said in his statement on Africa.            I&#13;
&#13;
think Figure 1 of the report, Poverty Reduction and the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank, is really striking on what should be our&#13;
&#13;
priority if we want to achieve the international&#13;
&#13;
development goals.&#13;
&#13;
         And the last point, we share Matthias Meyer's&#13;
&#13;
and others' interest for more concrete information on&#13;
&#13;
community-driven development.&#13;
&#13;
         Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. WOLFENSOHN:      Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
         Mr. Hyden.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. HYDEN:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         As a member of CODE, I made some comments there&#13;
&#13;
and I broadly support the conclusions in the Chairman's&#13;
&#13;
report on that discussion.     So I only wanted to add a&#13;
&#13;
couple of points today.&#13;
&#13;
         Firstly, I wanted to support Mr. Abraham's&#13;
&#13;
comments on the importance of rural development, trade and&#13;
&#13;
agriculture and also land reform in many countries.          In&#13;
&#13;
the CODE discussion, John Page reminded us of one of the&#13;
&#13;
key lessons of the East Asian miracle study that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
did some years ago, where a key element in the long period&#13;
&#13;
of strong economic growth achieved in the countries&#13;
&#13;
examined in that study seemed to be that the fact that&#13;
&#13;
growth was widely distributed enabled pro-growth policies&#13;
&#13;
to be maintained over a long period.&#13;
&#13;
         That is perhaps a little different from what we&#13;
&#13;
talk about under empowerment, but it does highlight that&#13;
&#13;
there is a macro political dimension to the maintenance of&#13;
&#13;
growth policies and to poverty reduction policies, though&#13;
&#13;
it is a complex issue and set of issues that we have to be&#13;
&#13;
conscious of.&#13;
&#13;
         Another lesson from the Bank's experience over&#13;
&#13;
the last decade or more has been the importance of country&#13;
&#13;
ownership.   I think we need also to be aware that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
interests of the Bank in promoting poverty reduction won't&#13;
&#13;
always be congruent with the policy objectives of&#13;
&#13;
governments which have to take into account a wider range&#13;
&#13;
with concerns.&#13;
&#13;
         It is, therefore, important that in our&#13;
&#13;
discussions with countries that the Bank and its staff&#13;
&#13;
have a clear paradigm, a set of ideas as to what we are&#13;
&#13;
trying to do.    And I think the WDR does provide us with an&#13;
&#13;
updated version of thinking.        But we also need to have&#13;
&#13;
clear Bank strategies which have more the status of&#13;
&#13;
policies endorsed by the Board and the management.&#13;
&#13;
         I think in that regard, we still have a good&#13;
&#13;
deal of hard work ahead of us, especially on this issue of&#13;
&#13;
empowerment, as some of the comments today have&#13;
&#13;
highlighted.    We need to be sensitive to the highly&#13;
&#13;
political nature of some of the issues, but nevertheless&#13;
&#13;
have a practical framework in which projects and programs&#13;
&#13;
can be developed.&#13;
&#13;
         Finally, I wanted to emphasize the importance of&#13;
&#13;
selectivity in the countries in which we operate and the&#13;
&#13;
weights in which we devote our resources to them.            Again,&#13;
&#13;
one of the lessons from the Bank's research is that we can&#13;
&#13;
double our effectiveness by putting our resources&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
primarily into countries which have good policy&#13;
&#13;
frameworks.   That is where one of the big returns from&#13;
&#13;
improving our effectiveness can come.         And we need to bear&#13;
&#13;
it in mind.&#13;
&#13;
         Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. WOLFENSOHN:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
         Mr. Meyer.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. MEYER:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
         Just three points.      First, just to take a little&#13;
&#13;
bit the counterpoint about Neil Hyden about policies which&#13;
&#13;
we all agree are very important.       I do think we have to&#13;
&#13;
include in the agenda poverty reduction, also the question&#13;
&#13;
of weak performers, particularly weak performers in&#13;
&#13;
countries where there are very high poverty rates.          I know&#13;
&#13;
this is a topic which is now being discussed in the&#13;
&#13;
context of IDA13, but I think this Board should clearly&#13;
&#13;
look at policies and at ways of maintaining a dialogue in&#13;
&#13;
a positive way and find innovative ways of being more&#13;
&#13;
effective in those circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
         So I do propose that this should be a topic&#13;
&#13;
which this Board should be concerned with in the near&#13;
&#13;
future in that context.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
          Secondly, in respect to the next steps,&#13;
&#13;
particularly the ones which are explained in the document&#13;
&#13;
on the follow-up and the WDR, I do want to repeat what we&#13;
&#13;
would like to see is a time-bound action plan where the&#13;
&#13;
internal responsibilities in the Bank for different parts&#13;
&#13;
of this agenda are clarified and that it should not remain&#13;
&#13;
a very large list of relatively unstructured future&#13;
&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
          We do acknowledge, of course, Ms. Prennushi's&#13;
&#13;
comments and clarifications on what the next report is&#13;
&#13;
going to include but we would like to see more than that&#13;
&#13;
in the sense that we would like to see how we make&#13;
&#13;
progress in the different parts of this agenda in&#13;
&#13;
relatively short time spans and what kind of resources we&#13;
&#13;
put into the activities.&#13;
&#13;
          So we would like to clarify and strengthen that&#13;
&#13;
debate.   A particular interest, of course, which we have&#13;
&#13;
is in developing methods of measuring poverty impact and&#13;
&#13;
risk and vulnerability at the project, program level and&#13;
&#13;
at the country level.    And we agree that we would like to&#13;
&#13;
see as quickly as possible this being reflected in loan&#13;
&#13;
and credit documents as well as in country strategies.&#13;
&#13;

                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
This is what we understand by mainstreaming and would like&#13;
&#13;
to have some kind of a calendar to mainstream it.&#13;
&#13;
         It shouldn't happen in five years.          We have to&#13;
&#13;
somehow clarify who is going to do it and how we want to&#13;
&#13;
advance on this and set some goals.&#13;
&#13;
         Just a last point, on the empowerment question,&#13;
&#13;
I think what the whole concept of empowerment tells us&#13;
&#13;
that there is a very close link between the poverty agenda&#13;
&#13;
and the Bank's governance agenda.      And in that sense, it&#13;
&#13;
is impossible to talk about empowerment without talking&#13;
&#13;
about decentralization and about the local political&#13;
&#13;
institutions and the way they work.       And in that sense, I&#13;
&#13;
think we have here another aspect of the poverty agenda&#13;
&#13;
which we have to highlight and where we have to show the&#13;
&#13;
links more than maybe we have done so far.&#13;
&#13;
         Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you very much, Mr. Meyer.&#13;
&#13;
         Ms. Piercy.    Ms. Piercy is not there.        There she&#13;
&#13;
is.&#13;
&#13;
         MS. PIERCY:    My apologies.&#13;
&#13;
         As we are members of CODE and expressed our&#13;
&#13;
views there, I will be brief.     I wanted to intervene just&#13;
&#13;
to clarify some confusion that appears to have arisen with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
respect to the views of the Secretary of the Treasury,&#13;
&#13;
Paul O'Neill.   I didn't realize I was going to have to&#13;
&#13;
clarify the views as well of the previous Secretary of the&#13;
&#13;
Treasury, but let me do both, because I do think it is&#13;
&#13;
very important that it not be misconstrued.&#13;
&#13;
          And I think, as I said at CODE, that Paul&#13;
&#13;
O'Neill's remarks with respect to the importance of growth&#13;
&#13;
have been taken to mean that there is less of an emphasis&#13;
&#13;
on poverty reduction.    And I want simply and briefly to&#13;
&#13;
clarify that that is not the case.&#13;
&#13;
          I, in fact, talked with the Under-Secretary&#13;
&#13;
International after the CODE meeting because this was a&#13;
&#13;
concern that was expressed.     I think, as my colleagues&#13;
&#13;
will well understand, people in public life are often&#13;
&#13;
quoted selectively, and it is something that you learn and&#13;
&#13;
you have to calibrate when you come new into a position as&#13;
&#13;
senior this.&#13;
&#13;
          So I simply wanted to offer that assurance&#13;
&#13;
because I believe it is very important that we do and we&#13;
&#13;
be understood to have a working consensus around this&#13;
&#13;
Board.   There may be nuances in our views, and some of&#13;
&#13;
those have come out in this morning's discussion, but&#13;
&#13;
fundamentally this focus and this deepened focus on&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
poverty reduction, growth and poverty reduction is&#13;
&#13;
something that there can be no reversal on.           So I wanted&#13;
&#13;
to clarify that.&#13;
&#13;
         Now with respect to the remarks that were quoted&#13;
&#13;
by Larry Summers, he addressed a group of the Country&#13;
&#13;
Directors, and I might say in passing here I think it is&#13;
&#13;
just tremendous that the Country Directors now do meet&#13;
&#13;
regularly, and he offered some off-the-cuff remarks at&#13;
&#13;
that time.   And it is true that he was reflecting on the&#13;
&#13;
nature of the engagement and who is engaged with.           But he&#13;
&#13;
also said that he is very much aware that there are&#13;
&#13;
countries where it is an important objective of the&#13;
&#13;
government to broaden participation, and the Bank indeed&#13;
&#13;
can be helpful in facilitating that.&#13;
&#13;
         And he also noted that in countries -- Myanmar&#13;
&#13;
has been mentioned earlier today and there are others --&#13;
&#13;
where the governance environment may be such that it is&#13;
&#13;
difficult to engage, and the Bank is there in a watching&#13;
&#13;
brief or in other ways.     And it becomes much more complex,&#13;
&#13;
this matter of who do we engage with in order to ensure&#13;
&#13;
that we provide continued attention to poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
         So those are the two points that I wanted to&#13;
&#13;
intervene to clarify.&#13;

&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Alvarez.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. ALVAREZ:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and also&#13;
&#13;
thank you to Ms. Piercy for the clarification.&#13;
&#13;
           We expressed our views at CODE mainly around the&#13;
&#13;
fact that poverty alleviation is a matter of economic&#13;
&#13;
growth.    And what has been lacking in our countries is&#13;
&#13;
sustainable growth or economic growth for a large amount&#13;
&#13;
of time.   This is documented in the Bank's country poverty&#13;
&#13;
assessment.   Every one of them I read has the same thing.&#13;
&#13;
The main deterrent or consideration for poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
is the increase in growth.&#13;
&#13;
           We know that growth of income comes first.          Only&#13;
&#13;
after you get the income to divide the social pie into&#13;
&#13;
different choices.      In basic economic text, we border and&#13;
&#13;
cannons [phonetic].     In our choices, domestic choice, it&#13;
&#13;
could be border or the environment.         It is a matter of&#13;
&#13;
constant choice.&#13;
&#13;
           And costs to the countries borrowing or&#13;
&#13;
borrowing countries and costs to the borrowing countries,&#13;
&#13;
again we cannot pretend to plan the world and making the&#13;
&#13;
choices for them from a central economic entity.           And this&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
is relevant not because of this discussion but of also the&#13;
&#13;
proposal that we have seen on the environment recently.&#13;
&#13;
         As Mr. Al-Saad, we think that it is important to&#13;
&#13;
keep in mind the presentation made by Mr. Summers before&#13;
&#13;
the Bank Directors.     While reading many parts of it, we&#13;
&#13;
had the feeling that we were reading Mr. Malan's statement&#13;
&#13;
or some of our other Ministers.&#13;
&#13;
         So in addition to our intervention in CODE, we&#13;
&#13;
would like to encourage management and staff to keep those&#13;
&#13;
points in mind while designing action plans.            After all,&#13;
&#13;
they are not only the views of a former Governor but many&#13;
&#13;
of the points are endorsed or have been raised in the past&#13;
&#13;
by our Governors.&#13;
&#13;
         Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. WOLFENSOHN:       Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         Mr. Jonck.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. JONCK:      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
         Most of my views are reflected adequately in the&#13;
&#13;
CODE statement.   So let me just emphasize four points.&#13;
&#13;
         The first one being that I think that it came&#13;
&#13;
clearly out of the CODE discussion and hopefully also&#13;
&#13;
clearly reflected in the statement that the key message&#13;
&#13;
from our discussion was the need in the future to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
emphasize more the impact assessment and the need to&#13;
&#13;
document results at the field level.&#13;
&#13;
           That means that the structure of the coming&#13;
&#13;
reports will have to be different and we have, as I said,&#13;
&#13;
to put more emphasis on this.      I am not quite sure what it&#13;
&#13;
means that this should particularly happen through demand-&#13;
&#13;
driven efforts.   I look at this as joint efforts which is&#13;
&#13;
undertaken due to our mutual interests in documenting&#13;
&#13;
results.&#13;
&#13;
           Secondly, on empowerment, I welcome very much&#13;
&#13;
the commitment of pursuing the agenda of empowerment.           I&#13;
&#13;
think it is clearly documented in the World Development&#13;
&#13;
Report that we have to move also in that direction.           But I&#13;
&#13;
think we should also -- of course, as has been said -- be&#13;
&#13;
aware of the sensitivity of this issue.            But let's avoid&#13;
&#13;
making this an issue of ideology or mandates.           If we look&#13;
&#13;
at what is in the operationalization report, the&#13;
&#13;
paragraphs 50 to 67 on empowerment and how it is fleshed&#13;
&#13;
out in specific policies, I don't think anybody will find&#13;
&#13;
anything revolutionary here.      This is very much what we&#13;
&#13;
already have embarked on.     Particularly in other&#13;
&#13;
institutions like the UN institutions, we have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
working on many of these things but also in our bilateral&#13;
&#13;
cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
         And I think we should look at this, and I think&#13;
&#13;
there is a clear basis for that and very pragmatic&#13;
&#13;
approach, an approach which will ensure better efficiency&#13;
&#13;
of our assistance and thereby also achieving better&#13;
&#13;
results in reducing poverty.        It is not a question I think&#13;
&#13;
of challenging the legitimacy of governments or anything.&#13;
&#13;
So let's avoid making it this kind of discussion.            At&#13;
&#13;
least I hope we can.&#13;
&#13;
         One thing I find extremely important in that&#13;
&#13;
context is what B.P. Singh mentioned, namely the&#13;
&#13;
empowerment of women and the need to take into account the&#13;
&#13;
different voices of men and women in the political life,&#13;
&#13;
in the community.&#13;
&#13;
         My third comment is on the issue of&#13;
&#13;
responsibility.   I think we all agree with the need for&#13;
&#13;
responsibility and accountability and that we need to&#13;
&#13;
spell it out more specifically how the responsibility and&#13;
&#13;
accountability is attributed.        But I also think that the&#13;
&#13;
discussion has already taken us one step further.            At&#13;
&#13;
least in my mind, the conclusion also came out that there&#13;
&#13;
is a primary responsibility for implementation, monitoring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
and achieving results in the regions and with the Country&#13;
&#13;
Directors.    I don't think we have to challenge that&#13;
&#13;
fundamental part.&#13;
&#13;
            Finally as my last part, I fully agree that&#13;
&#13;
PRSPs are a centerpiece in our efforts to fight poverty.&#13;
&#13;
And it is one of the most important instruments to be used&#13;
&#13;
in that context.    It is also said this will be the first&#13;
&#13;
step in the action plan or the next steps that is&#13;
&#13;
outlined.    It is to work further to continue the efforts&#13;
&#13;
of views and develop the PRSPs.&#13;
&#13;
            Probably we have to be aware that the challenge&#13;
&#13;
of aligning the poverty reduction or the ownership of the&#13;
&#13;
PRSPs with the Bank's policies might be bigger than we&#13;
&#13;
expected.    At least, I was surprised to read reports from&#13;
&#13;
the LDC conference in Brussels last month where it turned&#13;
&#13;
out that even mentioning the PRSPs in the final document&#13;
&#13;
became a contentious issue.       And it leads me to the&#13;
&#13;
conclusion that we probably have to revisit in the Board&#13;
&#13;
some time in the future some of these issues about&#13;
&#13;
ownership and the applicability of these things and how is&#13;
&#13;
it pursued outside this Board Room.&#13;

&#13;
         It is not just a question of reconfirming&#13;
&#13;
ourselves that this is the right thing.            We need to have&#13;
&#13;
the world, so to speak, with us all over.&#13;
&#13;
         Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. WOLFENSOHN:     Thank you, Mr. Jonck.&#13;
&#13;
         Let's give Mr. Stek a final word.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         I welcome the commitment made at the beginning&#13;
&#13;
by management to work on poverty impact assessments as&#13;
&#13;
well as on defining pro-poor growth.        I think that is&#13;
&#13;
basically about establishing policies that would help to&#13;
&#13;
create sustainable jobs where they are needed.           And that&#13;
&#13;
goes beyond the analysis of the linkages between growth&#13;
&#13;
and distribution and income distribution, which are very&#13;
&#13;
interesting and important and may have implications at the&#13;
&#13;
policy dialogue level with government and also practical&#13;
&#13;
implications.   But I hope that from the start we can also&#13;
&#13;
focus on this job creation aspect.&#13;
&#13;
         I am sure empowerment can be dealt with in a way&#13;
&#13;
that is constructive, and it surely will be agreed that it&#13;
&#13;
is useful to help create the ability to use opportunities&#13;
&#13;
that are available in the abstract.        And if it helps in&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
the marriage market, all the better, assuming that for one&#13;
&#13;
moment that this increases gross national happiness.&#13;
&#13;
          Prime examples I would say of empowerment that&#13;
&#13;
we haven't put that label on are education, health and&#13;
&#13;
access to finance, the point that B.P. made so clearly&#13;
&#13;
with examples.&#13;
&#13;
          On trade, I agree with Yahya, and I hope that&#13;
&#13;
there are more Part I countries that agree fully with&#13;
&#13;
this.   I am saying it for a mixed constituency but I know&#13;
&#13;
we feel very strongly that way in the Netherlands,&#13;
&#13;
although we at times also sin in the sense of protection.&#13;
&#13;
But we need to work on this and to continue to stress all&#13;
&#13;
the time how effective it is to open up in a trade sense&#13;
&#13;
and how short-sighted it is not to do so.&#13;
&#13;
          I want to point out that the EC countries just&#13;
&#13;
heard from a senior -- EU countries, I should say -- just&#13;
&#13;
heard from a senior officials from the Commission that&#13;
&#13;
non-LDC developing countries are beginning to voice&#13;
&#13;
concern about discrimination of the poorer countries.          Now&#13;
&#13;
I can well imagine this, because if you are the 41st&#13;
&#13;
country that just falls outside the liberalization&#13;
&#13;
initiative of the community, then you don't feel too happy&#13;
&#13;
about that.&#13;
&#13;

                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
          So I think it is clear that generalized&#13;
&#13;
liberalization is the appropriate solution, and I think we&#13;
&#13;
need to keep that in mind too.       And it would be&#13;
&#13;
interesting to see how DEC sees these somewhat arbitrary&#13;
&#13;
borderlines.&#13;
&#13;
          But at the same time, from a political point of&#13;
&#13;
view, I must say I welcome any advance, even if it for an&#13;
&#13;
unsatisfactory number of countries who do need&#13;
&#13;
liberalization badly, I do welcome that that&#13;
&#13;
liberalization does take place.        And if it increases the&#13;
&#13;
pressure from the others to be included, well, all the&#13;
&#13;
better.   Given the lack of enlightened self-interest among&#13;
&#13;
the industrialized countries, that pressure may be needed,&#13;
&#13;
and it may need to be forceful pressure.&#13;
&#13;
          Then, finally, I just want to revert to the&#13;
&#13;
issue of budget.   I simply hope that we will get more&#13;
&#13;
clarity about the adequacy of budget for priority areas&#13;
&#13;
like trade, environment and gender.&#13;
&#13;
          Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
         I am going to ask my colleagues to respond to&#13;
&#13;
particular questions.   But I would like to just reassure&#13;
&#13;
the Board on a number of points.&#13;
&#13;
         First of all, I think there is a very clear&#13;
&#13;
understanding of the fundamental building block of growth&#13;
&#13;
that comes out in the papers.     And it is certainly&#13;
&#13;
something that I think all of us deeply recognize.         Even&#13;
&#13;
in the absence of Larry Summers, I think we will remember&#13;
&#13;
that and that lesson is well learned and is at the base of&#13;
&#13;
what we are talking about here.&#13;
&#13;
         Secondly, I think we share with the CODE&#13;
&#13;
observations the need to move from reorienting the&#13;
&#13;
organization in terms of poverty to the implementation and&#13;
&#13;
measurement phase.   I think there has been a big change in&#13;
&#13;
the thinking and in the evolution of our thinking on the&#13;
&#13;
centrality of poverty in the way in which we build around&#13;
&#13;
things, but not only in relation to PRSPs and CDF but also&#13;
&#13;
in terms of this being the guiding light of what we are&#13;
&#13;
doing.&#13;
&#13;
         As I think you were saying before in the three&#13;
&#13;
reports that you have done, there has been quite a&#13;
&#13;
development in the last several years in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
reports that have come to the Board.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
         We are as a management team absolutely committed&#13;
&#13;
to try and take this to the next level this year in terms&#13;
&#13;
of measurement, in terms of look at the effectiveness, and&#13;
&#13;
also coming back on some of the issues which have been&#13;
&#13;
raised in terms of community ownership, participation,&#13;
&#13;
some of the issues which are not just generally agreed but&#13;
&#13;
which are at least a hypotheses that we are pursuing at&#13;
&#13;
the moment.&#13;
&#13;
         There is, as pointed out in the report, some&#13;
&#13;
fundamental difficulties just in the base information.          If&#13;
&#13;
you take India as an example, there is significant&#13;
&#13;
controversy just on the measurement of poverty in that&#13;
&#13;
country, and that is very central, and in China as well&#13;
&#13;
the methodologies are subject to considerable debate.           So&#13;
&#13;
when you are talking about global figures and you are&#13;
&#13;
talking about measurement, you start with 2.2 billion&#13;
&#13;
people in our current population of 6 billion where the&#13;
&#13;
measurements are challenged.&#13;
&#13;
         So it is not just a Bank problem in terms of&#13;
&#13;
being able to put our arms around this.           And in many&#13;
&#13;
countries there are no measurements at all.          So the issue&#13;
&#13;
of general measurement is something that I think cannot&#13;
&#13;
just wholly be put on the back of the Bank's incapacity to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
get itself organized to deal practically and pragmatically&#13;
&#13;
with this, but there are some surrounding issues.&#13;
&#13;
         And what troubles me most is that in the next&#13;
&#13;
twenty-five years, as I have said often, we add another 2&#13;
&#13;
billion clients to our client base in terms of just the&#13;
&#13;
developing and transition economies.       So if we have got&#13;
&#13;
4.8 billion, in another twenty-five years, twenty-five to&#13;
&#13;
thirty years we will have 6.8 billion.&#13;
&#13;
         So the issue of measurement and the issue of&#13;
&#13;
focus becomes very important.     It is that that has led us&#13;
&#13;
I think seriously to consider some of the issues that have&#13;
&#13;
been raised in terms of ownership and in terms of the new&#13;
&#13;
problems which Mr. Meyer raised of management.         How do as&#13;
&#13;
a central government manage this growth in population and&#13;
&#13;
poverty without local ownership?&#13;
&#13;
         Frankly, the thing that is at the core of my&#13;
&#13;
thinking at the moment and my concern is to take the Bank&#13;
&#13;
from programs which are perceived to be effective as&#13;
&#13;
methodologies to deal with the question of poverty.         And&#13;
&#13;
how do you leverage them up?     Assuming that you get some&#13;
&#13;
good projects and some good ideas on how you deal with&#13;
&#13;
them, how do we go to scale?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         There is talk in the reports and in the comments&#13;
&#13;
about retail or wholesale.    My concern is if we come up&#13;
&#13;
with good programmatic thrusts, given the weight of the&#13;
&#13;
people, how do you deal with leveraging up successful&#13;
&#13;
projects and successful programs in scale so that you can&#13;
&#13;
make a big difference at a national level?&#13;
&#13;
         We in the Bank and many others have been able to&#13;
&#13;
come up with programs which we see as being effective&#13;
&#13;
within the framework of a program.       So you have one&#13;
&#13;
program or two programs or two projects or three.         But how&#13;
&#13;
do you cover a country?   How do you get it owned?        How do&#13;
&#13;
you turn the people that are in poverty into not just&#13;
&#13;
objects of the programs but actors in owning the programs&#13;
&#13;
which will get them out of poverty?       How do you turn them&#13;
&#13;
from what I call the liability to the asset side?&#13;
&#13;
         And so when I talk about ownership and when I&#13;
&#13;
talk about engagement of the people, it is really that&#13;
&#13;
issue that I am concerned about.      How do we multiply the&#13;
&#13;
effectiveness of what we are doing in ways that are not&#13;
&#13;
just left to central government?      The central government&#13;
&#13;
would find it very difficult now.&#13;
&#13;
         We are seeing in the development of&#13;
&#13;
municipalities and towns and localities, and there some of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
the work that we are doing in training local mayors and&#13;
&#13;
administrators I think becomes very significant, the sort&#13;
&#13;
of thing that we are doing through Monterrey Institute of&#13;
&#13;
Technology.&#13;
&#13;
         But I am not saying that we have all the answers&#13;
&#13;
yet on what are effective projects, and indeed we need to&#13;
&#13;
work on that to see what works and what doesn't.          But I&#13;
&#13;
think there is a separate issue which is going to make, at&#13;
&#13;
least for me, all the difference, which is on the&#13;
&#13;
assumption that we have good programs, be it for girls'&#13;
&#13;
education or for conveyance of water or for communications&#13;
&#13;
or whatever.   How do you leverage that on a scale that it&#13;
&#13;
can be effective in terms of either country statistics or&#13;
&#13;
global statistics without rethinking the issue of&#13;
&#13;
ownership and distributed management in the community?&#13;
&#13;
         For me, that is going to make the difference.            I&#13;
&#13;
think we are learning a lot about how we can have&#13;
&#13;
effective programs.   But I am already at the point which I&#13;
&#13;
hope you will call us on next year, all right, let's&#13;
&#13;
measure the programs, let's look at the effectiveness of&#13;
&#13;
what we are doing.    We need to do a better job on that,&#13;
&#13;
but also take the next step.      How do you leverage it?      How&#13;
&#13;
do you get it to scale?    And what are the considerations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
that are involved in getting it to scale in which the Bank&#13;
&#13;
has some experience but by no means complete experience?&#13;
&#13;
          So I think you are right in many of the comments&#13;
&#13;
you are making.   I think that the underlying development&#13;
&#13;
in our thinking is going reasonably well, but I would have&#13;
&#13;
to say to you that I think that we and your own bilateral&#13;
&#13;
organizations don't yet completely have our arms around&#13;
&#13;
this problem.&#13;
&#13;
          If anyone feels that your national agencies do&#13;
&#13;
and can tell us how to do it, we would be delighted to&#13;
&#13;
hear.   But I really think that we are at the cutting edge&#13;
&#13;
of some very important issues here.        I don't, for example,&#13;
&#13;
Finn, think that the Nordics have this fully solved yet,&#13;
&#13;
nor the Dutch nor anybody.&#13;
&#13;
          So I hope that you feel that we are making&#13;
&#13;
progress and that we are identifying the right issues.          I&#13;
&#13;
do think that the CODE minutes are very useful in getting&#13;
&#13;
us focused on some of the issues.       But I would add to it&#13;
&#13;
this issue of leverage and scale, because I think we need&#13;
&#13;
to be considering that simultaneously with the issues&#13;
&#13;
here, because scale and our capacity to moving up in what&#13;
&#13;
we are doing is something that is very important.          And for&#13;
&#13;
this I think we probably have a lot to learn from India&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
and China and indeed the Ministers in both countries have&#13;
&#13;
suggested that we might take a look at how you scale up.&#13;
&#13;
         And how you scale up in a continent like Africa&#13;
&#13;
where you have so many different governments, where you&#13;
&#13;
are dealing not just with a government which can&#13;
&#13;
articulate a national policy but where in Africa we have&#13;
&#13;
to articulate very considerable national policies because&#13;
&#13;
of the number of states, number of countries, and within&#13;
&#13;
the countries the numbers of divisions and tribal&#13;
&#13;
differences and ethnic differences that you find.&#13;
&#13;
         So I think we are at the beginning of a very,&#13;
&#13;
very important phase in the Bank's development.         I am&#13;
&#13;
grateful to you for all of your comments.         I think the&#13;
&#13;
reports, I must say, are showing a real advance, but I&#13;
&#13;
don't underestimate the difficulty of the challenges which&#13;
&#13;
we jointly face as we move forward.       But I will ask my&#13;
&#13;
colleagues to respond.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. PAGE:   Thank you, Jim.&#13;
&#13;
         I will try to take a number of the cross-cutting&#13;
&#13;
issues that have come up and then ask Jo Ritzen to speak&#13;
&#13;
to two issues on the international development goals and&#13;
&#13;
trade which are central to the agenda in DEC.&#13;

&#13;
         First of all, again, let me thank you very much&#13;
&#13;
both for your kind remarks about the quality of the&#13;
&#13;
reports and also for once again reinforcing what I think&#13;
&#13;
is good behavior on our part, to try to be candid and&#13;
&#13;
frank in both our assessment of what we have done and&#13;
&#13;
where we have to go.&#13;
&#13;
         Let me begin just briefly to touch on this issue&#13;
&#13;
of what I would call consider false controversy between&#13;
&#13;
empowerment and economic growth.         The fundamental insight&#13;
&#13;
of the WDR, if I look at it and take it away, is that, in&#13;
&#13;
fact, the three elements of poverty reduction -- economic&#13;
&#13;
opportunity, regrowth if you will, empowerment and&#13;
&#13;
security -- are both simultaneously determined and&#13;
&#13;
interlocking.    They are all necessary in order to be&#13;
&#13;
successful.   And, as Neil Hyden reminded us, many of the&#13;
&#13;
aspects of the successful experience of the Asian&#13;
&#13;
economies in the 1960s through the 1980s precisely&#13;
&#13;
reflected that kind of intuitive understanding of the&#13;
&#13;
complex mix of needs for political consensus to support&#13;
&#13;
growth, therefore some elements of voice and a concern&#13;
&#13;
with security.&#13;
&#13;
         Academics, having been one myself, of course,&#13;
&#13;
love controversy.    And so what you do is you begin to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
build a dichotomy, and I would suggest that even the&#13;
&#13;
President-designate of Harvard might have been enjoying a&#13;
&#13;
bit academic controversy making in his remarks to our&#13;
&#13;
Country Director.&#13;
&#13;
         But as Mr. Singh reminded us, women's role in&#13;
&#13;
economic development could be seen through the lens of&#13;
&#13;
empowerment.   Yet, I think it was the same President-&#13;
&#13;
designate of Harvard who told us that investments in women&#13;
&#13;
were the highest payoff possible investment but then&#13;
&#13;
sitting in the chair of the Chief Economist of the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
         Similarly, the issue of governance which we have&#13;
&#13;
addressed around the table, quite clearly also has an&#13;
&#13;
aspect which is related to economic growth and the&#13;
&#13;
creation of economic opportunities.          I think the challenge&#13;
&#13;
for those of us who are now moving forward with our&#13;
&#13;
guidance on empowerment and the paper we will bring to you&#13;
&#13;
is to avoid the academic controversies and focus very&#13;
&#13;
squarely, one, on the interrelationship between this&#13;
&#13;
agenda and the agenda of creating economic opportunities,&#13;
&#13;
because I think that speaks clearly to the Bank's mandate&#13;
&#13;
and, secondly, of course, to recognize our comparative&#13;
&#13;
advantage.   Several Directors have mentioned the issue of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
partnerships.   Someone mentioned that the UN system is&#13;
&#13;
working in this area very frequently.&#13;
&#13;
          This is quite clear where we need to recognize&#13;
&#13;
that we may not have a comparative advantage in doing&#13;
&#13;
everything that is needed and that partnerships in this&#13;
&#13;
area would be both beneficial but also more productive for&#13;
&#13;
the purposes of providing better services to our own&#13;
&#13;
client countries.&#13;
&#13;
          So what we will be coming back to you with is&#13;
&#13;
very pragmatic, as you have seen described in the report,&#13;
&#13;
suggestions about how work that is already going on within&#13;
&#13;
the Bank can be scaled up, mainstreamed and brought into&#13;
&#13;
the arena of Bank operations but without attempting to&#13;
&#13;
continue what I think is a rather unproductive, false&#13;
&#13;
controversy between the need for voice mechanisms and&#13;
&#13;
empowerment and governance as major contributions both to&#13;
&#13;
poverty alleviation and poverty reduction and to economic&#13;
&#13;
growth.&#13;
&#13;
          We do clearly see the PRSP as the centerpiece of&#13;
&#13;
our low-income agenda and our low-income business model,&#13;
&#13;
and I am aware of the controversies that took place LDC&#13;
&#13;
III, and Finn Jonck reminds us of the fact that not&#13;
&#13;
everyone likes the label.       But we have had that experience&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
before.   Not everybody like the label of the Comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
Development Framework.    And what we are talking about is a&#13;
&#13;
set of principles here that are fundamental to the&#13;
&#13;
successful implementation of development assistance and&#13;
&#13;
whether we call them PRSPs or national poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
strategies, the real issue is to get the international&#13;
&#13;
community to come around, to recognize principles of&#13;
&#13;
country ownership, of broad-based set of policy actions in&#13;
&#13;
pursuit of poverty reduction, partnerships and monitoring&#13;
&#13;
results, something we have heard reflected from almost&#13;
&#13;
every chair around the table today.&#13;
&#13;
          Our instrument at the moment is the PRSP.          Our&#13;
&#13;
own Bank instrument is the country assistance strategy.            I&#13;
&#13;
think, as we move forward, what we will have to be&#13;
&#13;
reporting to you next year is the extent to which those&#13;
&#13;
country assistance strategies do reflect the national&#13;
&#13;
priorities of nationally-owned poverty reduction programs,&#13;
&#13;
call them what you will.&#13;
&#13;
          I think it is also very important in the context&#13;
&#13;
of the middle-income countries where we do not have the&#13;
&#13;
instrument of the PRSP, but where quite clearly I think we&#13;
&#13;
are committed to a similar effort to align our country&#13;
&#13;
assistance strategy to nationally-owned development goals.&#13;

&#13;
Here again, we are reminded that partnerships are&#13;
&#13;
absolutely critical.    And I would simply emphasize that in&#13;
&#13;
working on monitoring and evaluation we will not be&#13;
&#13;
undertaking this effort alone.&#13;
&#13;
         We have the efforts of Paris 21; we have the&#13;
&#13;
efforts taking place under the DAC with the cooperation of&#13;
&#13;
our Operations Evaluation Department and others, with the&#13;
&#13;
efforts of the UN system.    A major challenge will be, in&#13;
&#13;
fact, to forge those partnerships, make them productive,&#13;
&#13;
avoid unnecessary and unhelpful competition and, in fact,&#13;
&#13;
begin to come to a set of understandings about the&#13;
&#13;
relationship between international development goals,&#13;
&#13;
monitorable outcomes at the country level and the need for&#13;
&#13;
better data and national capacity building and ownership&#13;
&#13;
of the monitoring and evaluation effort, because at the&#13;
&#13;
end of the day it is not for us to monitor and evaluate&#13;
&#13;
the success of nationally-owned programs, but it is for&#13;
&#13;
the societies that own them to do so and use that&#13;
&#13;
information.&#13;
&#13;
         So we will have to focus not just on measuring&#13;
&#13;
for our own sake but also measuring for the sake of&#13;
&#13;
creating capacity in those countries.&#13;

&#13;
         If in showing the relationship between poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction and the environment strategy we have suggested&#13;
&#13;
the issue of sustainability is not also important, to&#13;
&#13;
respond to Mr. Peeters, I think we have done a disservice&#13;
&#13;
to our colleagues in environment.        Our colleagues in&#13;
&#13;
environment quite clearly recognize that environmental&#13;
&#13;
sustainability is also a key objective, but what I thought&#13;
&#13;
they did a very good job of showing was that that was not&#13;
&#13;
only compatible with but, in fact, made a positive&#13;
&#13;
contribution to the purposes of poverty reduction by&#13;
&#13;
focusing on sustainable livelihoods for the poor as one&#13;
&#13;
particular target group of the Bank's concern with&#13;
&#13;
environmental strategy.&#13;
&#13;
         So we would not like it to be at the detriment&#13;
&#13;
of our larger concern for the environment but simply to&#13;
&#13;
show how we can bring the poverty focus into work that had&#13;
&#13;
at one time seemed to be quite divorced from it.&#13;
&#13;
         Bank culture, three things:          incentive, skills&#13;
&#13;
and measurement.   We have come a long way, I think as&#13;
&#13;
everyone has recognized, in aligning incentives.           That is,&#13;
&#13;
of course, the result of a better strategy and better&#13;
&#13;
business models.   The President of the Bank was helping a&#13;
&#13;
little bit this morning to align some of my incentives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
So we will continue to look on success in poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction, and that brings us to the second thing, skills.&#13;
&#13;
           We are increasing our efforts to increase the&#13;
&#13;
skill level of staff in these areas.        I think you will see&#13;
&#13;
it particularly reflected in the work of the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
Institute and the networks in providing a direct link&#13;
&#13;
between engagement by our people in the field, including&#13;
&#13;
our decentralized staff, and the poverty reduction mission&#13;
&#13;
as outlined in the Attacking Poverty paper.&#13;
&#13;
           But we will also then need to measure the impact&#13;
&#13;
of that work.   And we have promised to come back next year&#13;
&#13;
with a better set of measurements to address those issues&#13;
&#13;
for you.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, simply on monitoring and evaluation, we&#13;
&#13;
have heard the message.    To achieve impact we need two&#13;
&#13;
things -- to bring the Country Directors and country teams&#13;
&#13;
to bear in practical country programs and, as the&#13;
&#13;
President reminds us, to help to scale those up to a&#13;
&#13;
larger impact; the role of the networks, measuring skills,&#13;
&#13;
monitoring and evaluation.     All of these things we will&#13;
&#13;
have to continue to work on.&#13;
&#13;
           But as you have seen, what we are committed to&#13;
&#13;
doing is shifting to measuring what we have achieved&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
rather than promising what we will achieve, and I think&#13;
&#13;
next year's report should, in fact, reflect that.&#13;
&#13;
           Jo.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. RITZEN:   Yes, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I very much appreciate the opportunity to say a&#13;
&#13;
few words in response to the questions raised on trade and&#13;
&#13;
on international development goals.        And I would like to&#13;
&#13;
take that order as trade presumably will have also&#13;
&#13;
significance for the international development goals, for&#13;
&#13;
the way in which they are going to be reached, can be&#13;
&#13;
reached.&#13;
&#13;
           And I do that very much from the perspective as&#13;
&#13;
it was in your questions, which I thought were very much&#13;
&#13;
on the ball, very much to the point, the perspective of&#13;
&#13;
implementation of looking for outcomes and also against&#13;
&#13;
the background of the response of the President that we&#13;
&#13;
are looking for ways of scaling up, for leveraging the&#13;
&#13;
activities which are taking place.&#13;
&#13;
           On trade, first of all, I think I would like to&#13;
&#13;
express my general appreciation for the way in which I&#13;
&#13;
think we have been able to move forward with your support&#13;
&#13;
and with the support of the Development Committee on&#13;
&#13;
setting the trade agenda.     And what I would like to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
communicate now is a kind of expansion of the work in&#13;
&#13;
progress with respect to what we are doing with that trade&#13;
&#13;
agenda and also responding to some of the issues which&#13;
&#13;
were raised in the sense of the least-developed countries&#13;
&#13;
and the other developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
         We are working, first and foremost I should say,&#13;
&#13;
on the least-developed countries.      There was already a&#13;
&#13;
framework there which was the integrated framework, which&#13;
&#13;
was a cooperation between different partners -- UNCTAD,&#13;
&#13;
WTO, but also other partners and the World Bank.         That has&#13;
&#13;
been for a long time more or less, say, quiet, and we have&#13;
&#13;
been able I think to revive that, revive that in a sense&#13;
&#13;
of, first of all, creating the back-stopping in the sense&#13;
&#13;
of sufficient Trust Funds; secondly, also, we have within&#13;
&#13;
the Bank a full understanding on the commitment of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, including, of course, the financial commitment, that&#13;
&#13;
is the financial commitment of different parts of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, Operations, Development Economics, of course also&#13;
&#13;
PREM, the different networks but, first and foremost,&#13;
&#13;
PREM.&#13;
&#13;
         We move forward in the sense that for the least-&#13;
&#13;
developed countries we would be engaged in five countries&#13;
&#13;
initially and in twelve countries by the end of the year&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
in a rolling scheme in which in three years' time we would&#13;
&#13;
be able to reach the 49 least-developed countries, reach&#13;
&#13;
them in a sense of working with them on, say, the three&#13;
&#13;
kinds of agendas -- first of all, supporting them with&#13;
&#13;
respect to international trade agreements.         Those are the&#13;
&#13;
questions with respect to Qatar but also to other tables&#13;
&#13;
in which discussions take place.&#13;
&#13;
         Secondly, of course, also looking at&#13;
&#13;
possibilities for regional agreements against the&#13;
&#13;
background of the analytics in the costs and benefits of&#13;
&#13;
regional trade agreements.    We had this ample discussion&#13;
&#13;
here on the policy research report on regional trade&#13;
&#13;
agreements which is an essential part I think also of the&#13;
&#13;
analytics which are used in the communications.&#13;
&#13;
         And thirdly, of course, looking also at the way&#13;
&#13;
in which developing countries can take benefit, can really&#13;
&#13;
also generate the benefits from something like the&#13;
&#13;
"everything but arms" agreements, other agreements from&#13;
&#13;
opening up in the developed world with respect to access&#13;
&#13;
for trade from developing countries.       That is on the&#13;
&#13;
least-developed countries.&#13;
&#13;
         Second, we have started also now to engage&#13;
&#13;
within the Bank through Operations in expanding the work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
on trade with individual countries, also beyond the least-&#13;
&#13;
developed countries.&#13;
&#13;
         Thirdly, analytics, with respect, in particular,&#13;
&#13;
to the win/win situation, with respect to opening up, with&#13;
&#13;
respect to trade and now, in particular, opening up of the&#13;
&#13;
markets of the developed world.      That has, of course, had&#13;
&#13;
several already results in the sense also of these very&#13;
&#13;
visible figures like $100 billion in income lost in the&#13;
&#13;
developing world, of which then actually around $16&#13;
&#13;
billion to $20 billion is lost in the least-developed&#13;
&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
         We are pursuing that work particularly on the&#13;
&#13;
basis of looking for the win/win situation.         Of course,&#13;
&#13;
reducing trade barriers, reducing subsidies in the rich&#13;
&#13;
countries is also to the benefit of the rich countries in&#13;
&#13;
the longer run through the dynamic effects.         So that is&#13;
&#13;
with respect to the trade agenda which is, of course, very&#13;
&#13;
important for reaching the international development goals&#13;
&#13;
in the sense of generating the growth necessary to promote&#13;
&#13;
poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
         On the international development goals, the&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Framework Paper has very much taken it on as a&#13;
&#13;
frame of reference.    The work in progress is here also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
that we would very much want to work, first of all, with&#13;
&#13;
partners and that we have a conference together with the&#13;
&#13;
International Monetary Fund, together with the United&#13;
&#13;
Nations organizations, together also with OECD but also&#13;
&#13;
with representatives from developing countries to set the&#13;
&#13;
agenda broadly with the other partners.&#13;
&#13;
         We realize there that the comparative advantage&#13;
&#13;
of the World Bank is very much in the area of analytics of&#13;
&#13;
evaluation with very much monitoring something jointly&#13;
&#13;
carried out with United Nations, UNDP, in particular, and&#13;
&#13;
also on data.   Those seem to be the three comparative&#13;
&#13;
advantages which we take on by first taking six country&#13;
&#13;
studies and then moving on from six in the next fiscal&#13;
&#13;
year to 20 where the six would be regionally distributed&#13;
&#13;
with the general notion that for those six countries,&#13;
&#13;
first of all, there would be a complete coherence with the&#13;
&#13;
PRSP process; it would be fully, say, embodied within the&#13;
&#13;
PRSP process; secondly, it would be fully involved with&#13;
&#13;
the country teams; but thirdly, it would be also driven&#13;
&#13;
by, say, understanding the results in each country in&#13;
&#13;
other countries, so to have a kind of coherence and to&#13;
&#13;
make sure that there was a lot of learning from one&#13;
&#13;
country to the other.&#13;

&#13;
            The main point here would be indeed scaling up.&#13;
&#13;
It would not be as much looking at projects, but it would&#13;
&#13;
really be looking at programs, programmatic approach in&#13;
&#13;
the country starting, first, with, say, the general&#13;
&#13;
question:    What is in that country in the way of reaching&#13;
&#13;
the international development goals or what is there in&#13;
&#13;
the way of pushing the frontier further?            International&#13;
&#13;
development goals may be more or less relevant in a&#13;
&#13;
country.    Some countries may be able already to reach&#13;
&#13;
them.   But then the question is not to stop there but&#13;
&#13;
really look at IDGs as a political platform very much for&#13;
&#13;
pushing the social agenda, for pushing poverty, for&#13;
&#13;
pushing education, health and environment.&#13;
&#13;
            In analytics, there is a substantial involvement&#13;
&#13;
of DEC, also with a notion that at some point that might&#13;
&#13;
lead to results useful for a World Development Report.&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation is very much in terms of lessons learned and&#13;
&#13;
data is very much in line with what John Page mentioned as&#13;
&#13;
the Paris 21 initiative.&#13;
&#13;
            Thank you very much.&#13;

            MR. WOLFENSOHN:   Thank you very much.        And thank&#13;

&#13;
            Just to clarify one point.       We are not talking&#13;
&#13;
here about an academic debate.       I was an academic myself&#13;
&#13;
and I will go back to academia when I leave the Bank.           At&#13;
&#13;
least, in academic you don't worry about implementation,&#13;
&#13;
you know.&#13;
&#13;
            [Laughter.]&#13;
&#13;
            What we are talking here about is we are not&#13;
&#13;
talking about the political sensitivity of empowerment.&#13;
&#13;
We are talking about analytical underpinning and the&#13;
&#13;
linkage of empowerment to economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
            Many of our colleagues think we are politically&#13;
&#13;
insensitive to empowerment.      If you look at the definition&#13;
&#13;
here of empowerment -- inclusion, participation,&#13;
&#13;
strengthening of local organizational capacity, enhancing&#13;
&#13;
accountability -- these apply to democracy here.           And no&#13;
&#13;
one is against democracy here.       But the UN has failed to&#13;
&#13;
push democracies in countries.       Democracy comes within a&#13;
&#13;
country; it doesn't come from the Bank or from the UN.&#13;
&#13;
            We are talking here about the analytical&#13;
&#13;
underpinning of empowerment and the linkage of empowerment&#13;
&#13;
to economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
            Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
          MR. ABRAHAM:     I will be brief, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
          I just want to relay to you in terms of&#13;
&#13;
governance structures and so on what we had the pleasure&#13;
&#13;
of discussing with President Museveni in our EDs' group&#13;
&#13;
travel.   Uganda now is at the point where it needs to jump&#13;
&#13;
to another stage in this development.&#13;
&#13;
          And so there are two issues for them.            One is a&#13;
&#13;
political issue and the other one is the investment issue.&#13;
&#13;
They have reduced poverty.       They have gone a long way in&#13;
&#13;
instituting reforms.     The economic issues that they are&#13;
&#13;
facing is that hardly or not as much as foreign private&#13;
&#13;
investment is coming into the country and they say what do&#13;
&#13;
we have to do to attract foreign investment.            So that is&#13;
&#13;
one issue that he discussed at length.&#13;
&#13;
          The second issue here is the issue of&#13;
&#13;
governance.   He went at length that they had recent&#13;
&#13;
elections now, and the elections, lo and behold, were not&#13;
&#13;
based on a party basis but they were based on an&#13;
&#13;
individual basis.    And the country fully participated.&#13;
&#13;
And the President himself, coming from a minority tribe,&#13;
&#13;
is the President and he is very popular.&#13;
&#13;
          We would like to underscore that the two-party&#13;
&#13;
system, the multi-party system cannot be imposed from&#13;
&#13;

                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&#13;
outside.   It will have to develop from the country, just&#13;
&#13;
like China and India have been able to have their own&#13;
&#13;
models in many respects.    A number of countries in Africa&#13;
&#13;
now have that approach, that governance cannot be imposed&#13;
&#13;
from outside.   And there are alternative models to the&#13;
&#13;
multi-party system.&#13;
&#13;
           I see when I travel in Africa from country to&#13;
&#13;
country the gridlock that is there just because countries&#13;
&#13;
have adopted the multi-party lock, stock and barrel&#13;
&#13;
without questioning its cultural and historical context.&#13;
&#13;
They cannot have these multi-party systems if they are&#13;
&#13;
based on a regional basis and so on.&#13;
&#13;
           And, therefore, to correct for that, a very&#13;
&#13;
strong and committed leadership at the top is very&#13;
&#13;
important, and we have those now in many parts of Africa.&#13;
&#13;
           So what we would like to emphasize is an&#13;
&#13;
understanding that these things cannot be imposed on these&#13;
&#13;
countries, but for the Bank and the United Nations system&#13;
&#13;
to recognize when there are good systems, even if they are&#13;
&#13;
not a multi-party system, to help them grow to a multi-&#13;
&#13;
party system.   It may not be now.      It is long-term. It is&#13;
&#13;
not that one-party systems are good; they are not good.&#13;
&#13;
But what we need here is a time framework to go from point&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
A to point B, and that is the understanding that we would&#13;
&#13;
like to have from the international system.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you very much, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Abraham.&#13;
&#13;
           That opens itself another very long discussion&#13;
&#13;
if we wanted to have it, but I suggest that we delay that&#13;
&#13;
to another time.&#13;
&#13;
           But there is no part of our report which is&#13;
&#13;
advocating a multi-party system.        I believe we are trying&#13;
&#13;
to deal with it in as neutral a way as we possibly can.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me thank the Executive Directors for noting&#13;
&#13;
this report, and we thank you for your useful comments.&#13;
