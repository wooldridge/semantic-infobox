&amp;#12;COUNTRY SNAPSHOT&#13;
&#13;
   Rapid growth has propelled Bangladesh from low-income to low-middle-income country&#13;
   (LMIC) status, as FY2014 per capita gross national income (GNI) of $1,080 crossed the mid-&#13;
   dle-income country threshold of $1,046. Per capita income continued to increase in FY2015 to&#13;
   $1,220. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew well above the average for developing countries in re-&#13;
   cent years, averaging 6.2 percent since 2010, with services and industry accounting for the bulk of&#13;
   the growth. While Bangladesh has achieved its ambition to reach middle-income status by 2021, the&#13;
   50th anniversary of its independence, the challenge will be to further accelerate growth so that it&#13;
   moves well past the threshold and further up the income range of LMICs.&#13;
   Several factors are behind the resilience of Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s economy, against the backdrop of a&#13;
   volatile global economy. Robust macroeconomic fundamentals at the onset of the financial crisis,&#13;
   strong growth of exports and remittances, and relatively under developed and insulated financial&#13;
   markets have played an important role. Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s exports doubled their world market share be-&#13;
   tween 1995 and 2012. The ready-made garment (RMG) sector has been a key contributor, with its&#13;
   share of total exports accounting for more than 80 percent in FY2014. Bangladesh is now the worldâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
   second largest garment exporter, making it unique among low-income countries because of the high&#13;
   share of manufactured goods in its exports (90 percent vs. ~20 percent in comparator countries in&#13;
   2012).&#13;
   Progress on reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity through human devel-&#13;
   opment and employment generation has continued. This needs to be further consolidated in the&#13;
   near term by sustaining GDP and remittances growth, creating jobs, containing inflation, and making&#13;
   progress on improving the quality of service delivery in health and education. Private investments&#13;
   need to increase significantly to achieve the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 7 percent growth target for FY2016. At&#13;
   the same time, the quality of public investment needs to be substantially enhanced to alleviate the&#13;
   infrastructure constraints on private investments and to expand service delivery. Moving forward in&#13;
   the immediate future, stronger attention is needed to: (i) swiftly complete the transition in the gar-&#13;
   ment industry: (ii) finish critical ongoing road development projects; (iii) enact the Public-Private&#13;
   Partnership (PPP) law; and (iv) facilitate building Special Economic Zones (SEZs).&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Brick fields expel into the air more than 9.8 million tons of greenhouse gases annually, due to a combination of old technology, weak environmental legislation and&#13;
     enforcement, and a lack of corporate responsibility. Meanwhile, growing numbers of motorized vehicles are clogging up roads and contribute further to poor air&#13;
     quality. Brick kilns and motor vehicles contribute up to 60 percent of fine particulate pollution in Dhaka during the dry season.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The Clean Air and Sustainable Environment (CASE) Project aims to improve air quality and safe mobility in Dhaka through the implementation of demonstration&#13;
     initiatives in urban transport and brick-making.&#13;
     CASE components include:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Encouraging the adoption of cleaner and more energy-efficient brick manufacturing technologies such as converting to improved kiln alternatives and launching&#13;
            12 demonstration projects. The project also encourages research into alternatives to bricks such as micro-concrete, while helping the government strengthen&#13;
            environmental laws and providing support for the newly established Air Quality Management section responsible for air quality monitoring, data analysis, and&#13;
            reporting.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Promoting safe pedestrian mobility in Dhaka by rehabilitating and improving sidewalks with drainage, constructing foot bridges; improving traffic management&#13;
            by upgrading intersections, installing traffic signals and training police in enforcing them; supporting studies for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Line 3.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Installation of 11 Continuous Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAMS) in eight cities to monitor major air pollutants and generate real-time air quality data.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Completion of eight clean and energy-efficient brick kiln pilots, with another two underway.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Air Quality Index (AQI) regularly published in project website (www.case-moef.gov.bd).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Brick Manufacturing and Kiln Construction Control Act approved in 2013 and the relevant rules at the final stage of preparation.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Completion of 60 kilometers of sidewalk and road improvement, and 35 intersection improvements.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Construction of 19 footbridges, with four others being built.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Installation of 62 traffic signals connected with solar panel and battery.&#13;

BACKGROUND:&#13;
Bangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change. To address this challenge, Bangladesh launched its Climate Change&#13;
Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) in 2009 to build a medium- to long-term program for enhancing resilience to climate shocks and facilitating low carbon and&#13;
sustainable growth. To support implementation of the BCCSAP, seven development partners established the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) in&#13;
2010, with the World Bank acting as trust fund administrator. About $130 million has been received to date. The fund will close in June 2017.&#13;
&#13;
FUND OBJECTIVE:&#13;
The objective of the BCCRF is to support implementation of the BCCSAP, a 10 -year program (2009-2018) aimed at building the capacity and resilience of the country&#13;
to meet the challenge of climate change. Sectoral ministries are implementing four investment projects: (i) cyclone shelters ($25 million); (ii) solar irrigation ($10&#13;
million); (iii) afforestation ($33.8 million); and (iv) community climate change ($12.5 million). A number of studies on climate change have also been undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      61 new multipurpose cyclone shelters built in climate-vulnerable areas.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      45,000 farmers provided with access to clean energy services for irrigation pumping.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      17,000 hectares of land reforested or afforested.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      40,000 climate vulnerable people receive resilient investments/advice to build climate adaptive capacity.&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s coastal zone spans over 580 kilometers and includes territory where 28 percent of the population resides. A higher percentage of the population lives&#13;
     below the absolute poverty line in the coastal area than in the rest of the country. A recent World Bank study on the cost of adapting to extreme weather estimated&#13;
     that eight million people are currently vulnerable to inundation depths greater than three meters due to cyclonic storm surges. This number will increase to 13.5&#13;
     million people by 2050. There is an urgent need to rehabilitate and upgrade protection polders â&#128;&#147; areas of low-lying land - and enhance the resilience of coastal areas&#13;
     to cyclones, tidal and flood inundations, and salinity intrusion.&#13;
&#13;
     The Coastal Embankment Improvement Project-Phase 1 (CEIP1) was approved in June 2013 and has been effective since November 2013. The main design and&#13;
     supervision firm are in place, the tender for the construction of the first phase of polder investments has been evaluated and works implementation is expected to start&#13;
     by the upcoming dry season (November 2015). The bid documentation for the construction of the second phase of polder construction is currently being prepared and&#13;
     is expected to be advertised by the end of 2015.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     CEIP1 aims to: (i) increase the area protected in selected polders from tidal flooding and storm surges, which are expected to worsen due to climate change; (ii)&#13;
     improve agricultural production by reducing saline water intrusion in selected polders; and (iii) improve the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to respond promptly and effectively&#13;
     to a crisis or emergency.&#13;
&#13;
     It calls for upgrading Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s embankment system by increasing the area in polders protected from tidal flooding and frequent storm surges. This would provide&#13;
     direct protection to those living within the polder boundaries and enhance the resilience of coastal areas to cyclones, tidal and flood inundations, and salinity intrusion.&#13;
     This, in turn, will enhance peopleâ&#128;&#153;s livelihoods through increased agricultural production during normal weather as well as reduced loss of life, assets, crops, and&#13;
     livestock in the event of a disaster.&#13;
&#13;
     EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Rehabilitation of 17 polders in six coastal districts: Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira, Barguna, Patuakhali, and Pirojpur.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Improved protection for 760,000 people living within polder boundaries.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Poverty reduction and stimulated economic development from facilitating the growth of farm and non-farm activities in the coastal area.&#13;

&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Chittagong, Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s second-largest city, suffers from inadequate water production and sewerage systems. The port cityâ&#128;&#153;s water production capacity is only 40&#13;
percent of the estimated demand, and the pipe network is run down. A large percentage of the city continues to access water through shallow tube wells. The quality of&#13;
this underground water is questionable, with high salt and iron levels posing health risks to the public. In addition, very little investment has been made into sanitation&#13;
and storm water drainage since the late 1980s. Chittagong still does not have a water-borne sewage system or effective storm-water drainage service. The Chittagong&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (CWASA) lacks both the capacity and finance to establish these systems. The Bank helped CWASA develop its institutional capacity&#13;
development program launched in June 2012.&#13;
&#13;
The Chittagong Water Supply Improvement and Sanitation Project was restructured in February 2014 following the mid-term review held in December 2013. This&#13;
included a small cancellation and a reduction in the scope of investment activities. In June 2015, the project was restructured a second time to extend the closing date&#13;
of the project to December 31, 2018.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The project aims to increase access to safe water and improve CWASAâ&#128;&#153;s institutional capacity and investment planning for sanitation and drainage in Chittagong.&#13;
&#13;
It supports major interventions in treated water production, transmission and distribution including the construction of a water treatment plant in CWASAâ&#128;&#153;s development&#13;
plan and the rehabilitation and extension of the water distribution system. The support includes studies to update the sewerage master plans and drainage master&#13;
plans for Chittagong, as well as capacity building at operational levels to improve the efficiency of overall service delivery&#13;
Project performance is primarily driven by major works packages that account for about 80 percent of the restructured project.&#13;
&#13;
ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Contract awarded for Kalurghat Booster Station, Modunaghat Water Treatment Plant, distribution and transmission mains.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Contracts for all key technical assistance activities, including for the sanitation and drainage master planning and for utility modernization, have been signed and&#13;
       are advancing well.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      100 percent of all project funds are now committed.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Water now available in five low-income communities.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      150,000 people with access to improved water sources.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Cover 85 percent of CWASAâ&#128;&#153;s operation and maintenance cost from direct water sales revenue.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Prepare $150 million of priority sanitation and drainage investments for financing.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     The Government of Bangladesh implements numerous programs to address vulnerability and poverty, including safety nets, social care services, and microfinance,&#13;
     among others. However, several particularly marginalized groups remain excluded from the coverage of such interventions. Prominent among such groups are&#13;
     persons-with-disabilities (PWDs) and children-at-risk. Lack of access to services results in PWDs being excluded from broader social and economic participation, with&#13;
     negative impacts on family livelihoods and productivity. The costs of reversing the effects of negative human development outcomes later in life far outweigh the costs&#13;
     of providing quality social care to young children at an early stage, particularly for the poor and vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
     The Disability and Children-At-Risk Project (DCAR) was originally approved in 2008 with the objective of expanding the coverage, use, and quality of social care services&#13;
     for persons with disabilities and children at risk as a means of promoting equity and social inclusion. However, in 2009, shifting priorities at the Ministry of Social&#13;
     Welfare (MoSW) necessitated a significant restructuring of the project. This restructuring was driven by a policy decision to strengthen and scale up public social welfare&#13;
     institutions and service delivery systems, as well as on the implementation arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
     Since the original change in design, the project has been restructured two more times (2013 and 2015) to cancel 43 percent of the originally committed amount due&#13;
     to the design changes as well as slow implementation progress, and to extend the original closing date.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     DCAR aims to expand coverage and improve the quality of services for PWDs and children at risk by strengthening and scaling up government service delivery systems.&#13;
     The project comprises two components:&#13;
     Component 1: Strengthening Disability Services: This component provides support to the Jatiyo Protibondhi Unnayan Foundation (JPUF) in expanding the coverage&#13;
     of its Disability Service Centers (DSCs) providing upgrades to technical facilities, financing diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and assistive devices for PWDs,&#13;
     providing training for service providers and relevant stakeholders, and establishing outreach services to cater to PWDs in remote rural areas of the country.&#13;
&#13;
     Component 2: Strengthening Children-At-Risk Services and Social Welfare Program Administration. This component provides support to the Department of Social&#13;
     Services (DSS) in establishing and operating Integrated Child Projection Service Centers (ICPSCs), including crisis management, psychosocial counseling, and re-&#13;
     integration services for children-at-risk, as well as providing training for service providers and relevant stakeholders. This component is also financing the development&#13;
     of a management information system to administer major programs implemented by MoSW.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Establishment of 50 DSCs (using project financing) providing services to 30,000 PWDs in addition to 53 government-financed DSCs catering to 98,000 PWDs.&#13;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Dhakaâ&#128;&#153;s growing population of 15 million is placing serious strains on the cityâ&#128;&#153;s ability to provide basic water, sanitation, and drainage services. Dhaka Water Supply&#13;
and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) provides water services to about 70 percent of the population of Dhaka City. However, the quality of these services is inadequate and&#13;
uneven. In some areas (especially slum areas), services are non-existent. The existing sewerage network covers only about 30 percent of the city area.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The Dhaka Water Supply and Sanitation project aims to improve storm-water drainage in select catchments in Dhaka, and to improve DWASAâ&#128;&#153;s planning capacity.&#13;
&#13;
It supports the ongoing rehabilitation work in parts of the Khilgaon-Basabo, Abdullahpur, Shutivola, Shahjadpur, Baunia, Digun, Mohakhali and Gerani canals in a&#13;
bid to improve storm-water drainage and minimize urban flooding, particularly in the eastern part of Dhaka. In addition, it supports the construction of two storm-&#13;
water pumping stations. The project also has completed preparation of the Dhaka sewerage master plan, drainage master plan, and low-income customers service&#13;
improvement plan, as part of the initiative to improve DWASAâ&#128;&#153;s planning capacity.&#13;
&#13;
The sewerage master planning has led to the identification of key future wastewater collection and treatment investments in the city. Engineering designs and&#13;
corresponding bidding documents for $45 million of priority sewerage and wastewater treatment interventions also have been prepared, with work continuing on&#13;
other steps for institutional strengthening of DWASA.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Rampura pumping station was commissioned in August 2015.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Kamlapur pumping station is nearing completion and will be commissioned by November 2015.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Improved drainage facilities are benefiting three million of the targeted four million people.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Permanent storm-water pumping capacity has increased by 25 cubic meters, and is expected to reach the 40 cubic meters target by project closing.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     The capacity of rehabilitated drainage canals has increased by 150 cubic meters, more than half the target of 250.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     All four master plans have been prepared. The sewerage master plan has been approved by the board. Drainage master plan, the low-income customerâ&#128;&#153;s service&#13;
      improvement plan, and the organizational restructuring action plan will be approved by DWASAâ&#128;&#153;s board by project closing.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     On November 15, 2007, Cyclone Sidr made landfall across the southern coast of Bangladesh, causing extensive damage to lives and property. Overall, around 30&#13;
     districts and nine million people were affected by the storm. Total damage and losses caused by 2007 Cyclone Sidr were estimated about $1.7 billion.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The objective is to support government efforts to facilitate restoration and recovery from the damage to livelihoods and infrastructure caused by Cyclones Sidr in 2007&#13;
     and Aila in 2009, and build long-term preparedness through strengthened disaster risk reduction and management. The project has six components: (i) restoration&#13;
     of the agriculture sector in Sidr/Aila-affected areas; (ii) improvement of existing multipurpose shelters and construction of new disaster shelters; (iii) rehabilitation&#13;
     of coastal embankments; (iv) strengthening the capacity of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s disaster risk reduction management; (v) monitoring and evaluation to ensure effective&#13;
     implementation of the sub-projects; and (vi) a project management component to support the government in coordinating all project-related activities, strategic&#13;
     studies for the preparation of future operations for the long-term disaster risk reduction program, and technical assistance and training, as well as providing emergency&#13;
     support for future disasters during implementation.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Activities to restore the agriculture sector (under the first component of the project) were completed successfully in June 30, 2014. At component closing, the&#13;
          activities exceeded beneficiary targets, with crops by 33 percent, livestock by 13 percent and fisheries by 30 percent.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Rehabilitation work on the existing 257 shelters has been completed, along with construction of 164 new shelters.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Repair work on the 260 kilometers of coastal embankments has been completed.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    According to a household survey completed in 2014 in the project sites, the majority of the project beneficiary households have reported an increase in their&#13;
          income in the past season and there has been an approximately 10 percent reduction in poverty incidence due to project interventions.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The project has also delivered feasibility reports for future investment projects (components four and six). Of those, the River Management Improvement Project&#13;
          is being prepared and the Multipurpose Disaster Shelter Project, Coastal Embankment Improvement Project, and the Modern Food Storage Project are being&#13;
          implemented.&#13;

INTRODUCTION:&#13;
The Bangladesh government allocates about 2.2 percent of gross domestic product to education, but just 0.2 percent is dedicated to tertiary education. With 85 percent&#13;
of the tertiary education budget feeding into recurring expenditures, development programs for promoting and establishing research and innovation in higher&#13;
education institutes (HEIs) remain under-funded. Additionally, there is still no effective mechanism linking university research with industry and business at home or&#13;
abroad. Low connectivity and inadequate information and communication technology penetration further limit knowledge exchanges and collaboration among HEIs&#13;
and their researchers with local and global research platforms.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE:&#13;
To improve the quality and relevance of the teaching and research environment in higher education institutions by encouraging both innovation and accountability&#13;
within universities, and by enhancing the technical and institutional capacity of the higher-education sector.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The project promotes academic innovation among eligible public and private universities through a competitive funding mechanism known as the Academic&#13;
Innovation Fund (AIF). Based on a set of selection criteria, the AIF is granted through four windows: (i) improvement of teaching and learning; (ii) enhancement of&#13;
research capabilities at the universities; (iii) university-wide innovations including establishment of Technology Transfer Office; and (iv) innovation and university-&#13;
industry collaboration. The project also supports the establishment of quality assurance mechanisms at national and institutional levels for the tertiary education sector.&#13;
In addition, the project has established the Bangladesh Research and Education Network (BdREN), which connects universities to high-speed data communications&#13;
network, enabling teachers, researchers, and students to access the latest knowledge, inter-university video classes and engage in collaborative research. The University&#13;
Grant Commission Digital Library has also been established and is operational with public and private universities.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    329 academic innovation grants awarded to 27 public and nine private universities through three rounds. Five university-industry collaboration grants to spur&#13;
     innovation have been awarded.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The AIF grants have supported research and innovations (including enhanced methods for breast cancer detection, vaccination for farm animal disease, etc.) as&#13;
     well as dissemination of new knowledge through production of 120 peer-reviewed academic journals.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    BdREN connectivity is fully functional at the University Grants Commission (UGC) and in six universities.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Fifteen percent of students and faculty members have advanced Internet connectivity.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    UGC Digital Library is fully operational, providing 41 member universities (32 public, nine private) access to over 30,000 e-resources (research databases, e-&#13;
     journals, e-books).&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in improving the health of the population, especially women and children. The country is on track to achieve child and&#13;
     maternal mortality Millennium Development Goals. Significant achievements have been made in the control of communicable diseases. The country conducted the&#13;
     worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest measles-rubella campaign earlier in 2014, covering 53 million children. The World Health Organization recently declared Bangladesh a polio-free&#13;
     zone. Still, considerable development challenges remain in the health sector. Non-communicable diseases represent a growing share of the total Burden of Disease.&#13;
     In addition to the increasing burden of cardiovascular diseases and injuries, figures for malnourished women and children in Bangladesh, although in decline, still&#13;
     remain very high. There is also a growing concern about the rise in overweight individuals. Public spending on health is low in comparison to other countries, with&#13;
     out of pocket expenditures at 63.35 percent of total health spending. Catastrophic health expenditures push people into poverty. The population is rapidly urbanizing&#13;
     -- creating new challenges for the delivery of social and health services, particularly to the urban poor. Despite high treatment success rates for tuberculosis, case&#13;
     detection rates are very low. The health workforce is both insufficient and inefficiently distributed, the provision of health services is fragmented, and the quality of&#13;
     health care needs improvement.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) aims to enable the Government of Bangladesh to strengthen health systems and improve health services, particularly&#13;
     for the poor. It supports the government in providing essential health services, including reproductive health, family planning and antenatal care; scaling up emergency&#13;
     obstetric and newborn care services; and ensuring 24-hour services in district hospitals and selected health centers. The project also aligns multiple development&#13;
     partners to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s priorities in health, nutrition, and population, and uses country systems for implementation and monitoring. It strengthens health-sector&#13;
     planning and resource management, human resource development, pharmaceuticals management, health information systems and the maintenance of health care&#13;
     facilities. In addition, HSDP seeks to improve the control and treatment of both communicable and non-communicable diseases through the provision of vaccinations,&#13;
     scaling up HIV/AIDS interventions for the most-at-risk groups, and improving the quality of treatment for tuberculosis and the control and treatment of malaria in 13&#13;
     highly endemic areas. For non-communicable diseases, HSDP aims to improve awareness of cardio-vascular disease risks, provide better diagnosis and management&#13;
     of diabetes, and improve screening for cancer.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Reduced maternal mortality by 40 percent, down to 194 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2010.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Child mortality has reduced by more than 50 percent, to 46 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2014.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Helped bring basic vaccination coverage of children younger than 23 months to approximately 84 percent in 2014.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Skilled birth attendants were at 42.1 percent of births in 2014, up from 18 percent in 2007.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    About 93 percent of the detected New Smear Positive TB cases have been successfully treated as of 2014.&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Agriculture provides livelihoods more than 60 percent of the population of Bangladesh. Despite Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s success in reaching near self-sufficiency in food&#13;
production, people living in the flash flood and drought-prone districts in the northwest and the saline-affected tidal surge areas in the south struggle to earn a living&#13;
or produce enough food to eat. These regions suffer from higher poverty than the national average. The link between unfavorable agricultural environments, where&#13;
farmers lack knowledge and technology, and chronic poverty, coupled with food insecurity, is abundantly clear in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The project aims to enhance the productivity of agriculture (crops, livestock, and fisheries) in selected agro-ecologically constrained and economically depressed areas.&#13;
&#13;
It seeks to use technology and training to enhance agricultural production in the northern and southern districts affected by flash floods, drought and tidal surge areas&#13;
affected by saline. The project focuses on alleviating poverty and increasing food security through increased production of major crops such as cereals, diversification&#13;
of high-value non-cereal crops such as fruits and vegetables, and development of non-crop agriculture such as fishery, poultry, and livestock. Livelihood Field Schools&#13;
improve farmersâ&#128;&#153; understanding and skills base, and also demonstrate the use of improved technologies. The project also aims to release new and improved crop&#13;
varieties and more productive fish species, and help farmers increase crop intensity by conserving and utilizing surface water and improving the availability and&#13;
efficient use of irrigation water.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The Department of Agriculture Extension formed 7,200 Livelihood Field Schools and conducted more than 38,000 demonstrations on various crops and im-&#13;
     proved technologies.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The Department of Fisheries formed 2,100 fish farmer groups and conducted 5,880 demonstrations on improved fish varieties and production technologies.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved agricultural technologies adopted by more than 208,000 farmers, including improved irrigation for 23,312 hectares.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Release for use of 17 improved production packages for crops and nine for aquaculture, as well as 11 improved various crop varieties (four improved varieties of&#13;
     Wheat, one hybrid of mustard, one pulses and five new rice varieties);&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation processed 3,000 tons of certified seeds in new facilities.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s aspiration to become a middle-income country has been constrained by the large gap in infrastructure investment. Bridging the infrastructure gap&#13;
     has two major challenges: (i) low country capacity to conceptualize, design, and contract infrastructure ventures; and (ii) lack of long-term financing for successful&#13;
     closure of the infrastructure investment proposals. Key infrastructure ministries/agencies of the government have a long way to go before they can gather adequate&#13;
     technical and financial capacity to develop and implement the required infrastructure projects. Fiscal constraints on the government add on to financing side of the&#13;
     problem. As such, Government of Bangladesh has adopted the policy of promoting private sector participation in key infrastructure sectors, including energy and&#13;
     power, roads and bridges, information and communications technology, inland container terminal, river port and sea-port infrastructure. Public-private partnership&#13;
     (PPP) has been identified as an important tool to leverage the technical, financial, and project management resources of the private sector. Although the Private&#13;
     Sector Investment Guideline (PSIG) 2004 encouraged the private sector, it did not provide for support to feasibility studies, transaction management, and other&#13;
     upstream activities associated with infrastructure investment proposals. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s commercial-bank-dominated financial sector has historically been lending&#13;
     for shorter terms spanning over one â&#128;&#147; three years. Limited financial capacity, risk of asset liability mismatch, and lack of integration to international debt markets&#13;
     have constrained the local financial institutionsâ&#128;&#153; ability to finance infrastructure projects for longer terms such as 10 to 15 years. As a consequence, infrastructure&#13;
     development programs, which are long-term in nature, had been suffering and the country needed Internal Development Association support with new lending facility&#13;
     to bridge the infrastructure gap.&#13;
&#13;
     This project was taken up to increase private-sector investment in infrastructure by working with key government agencies and local financial institutions (FIs), selected&#13;
     based on pre-set eligibility criteria. Under the facility, the FIs apply to Bangladesh Bank, the projectâ&#128;&#153;s implementing agency, for partial debt financing, which they on-&#13;
     lend to private-sector sponsors awarded or licensed to implement infrastructure sub-project.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The objectives of the project are: (i) to supplement the resources of local financial institutions to provide long-term finance for infrastructure investment proposals;&#13;
     and (ii) to promote the role of entrepreneurs in infrastructure development. To this end, apart from the main on-lending component, the project provides for technical&#13;
     assistance in two streams: for institutional strengthening of the PPP Office of Government, and for development of pipeline sub-projects by supporting upstream&#13;
     activities including feasibility studies, transaction support, and preparation of bid documents. The overarching goal is to increase eligibility of the sub-projects for IPFF&#13;
     funding and impart good practices in project development in Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Delivery of 10 fully operational power plants, adding 478 megawatts (MW) of electricity to the national grid, with another 100 MW coming by December 2015.&#13;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The IDEA Project aims to establish a secure, accurate, and reliable national identification (NID) management system in Bangladesh to serve as the basis for more&#13;
efficient, inclusive, and transparent service delivery. It aims to: (i) build and strengthen the NID system; (ii) develop the capacity of National Identity Registration&#13;
Wing (NIDW) to provide identity verification services; (iii) support Bangladesh Election Commission in issuing smart NID cards with robust security features; and (iv)&#13;
develop capacity over the longer term to integrate the new ID system into a wide range of both public and private services. It contributes to enhance the data quality&#13;
to facilitate online as well as off-line NID verification services. The smart NID cards usher in a new avenue for effective and reliable off-line verification service. The&#13;
agencies delivering services to citizens in Bangladesh can now greatly reduce their transaction costs by efficiently identifying their clients and maintaining their own&#13;
databases of customers.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s objective is to establish a secure, accurate, and reliable national identification system in Bangladesh to serve as the basis for more efficient and transparent&#13;
service delivery. The components of IDEA Project include: putting in place the regulatory framework, which has already been achieved; the management of the NID&#13;
verification system and the management of producing and distributing smart NID cards; and capacity building, communication, and overall project management.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The enrollment of the citizens older than 18 in the NID database has become nearly universal. There is biometric data for over 96 million citizens in the database.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The National Board of Revenue (NBR) is providing an electronic-Taxpayerâ&#128;&#153;s Identification Number (e-TIN) to the eligible citizens based on the NID database. This&#13;
     has enabled less duplication of TINs, which has led to a reduction in taxpayersâ&#128;&#153; number from 3 million records in 2013 to 1.8 million in 2015. Using the NID&#13;
     system, there is a scope of widening the tax base by bringing eligible citizens under the coverage of the tax network.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Using the online NID verification system, Bangladesh Bankâ&#128;&#153;s (BB) Credit Information Bureau is now able to authenticate the identity of the citizens who have&#13;
     applied for different types of loans from the financial institutions. The BB can effectively and transparently identify an individualâ&#128;&#153;s credit worthiness; also citizensâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
     access to credit facilities has become easier now.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The BRAC Bank Ltd. and Dutch Bangla Bank Ltd., two leading private-sector commercial banks, have started using identity verification through the NID system.&#13;
     This will enable poor people to open bank accounts and, hence, remove constraints to accessing different financial services, in particular, the mobile financial&#13;
     services and safety net schemes of the government.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The Passport Authority is verifying identity of the citizens who apply for passports. The verification service enables citizens to effectively assert their identity as a&#13;
     Bangladeshi and allows the poor to effectively access overseas employment opportunities managed by the government.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The 17-digit NID number containing year of birth and geographical information of a citizen has been replaced by a 10- digit unique NID number. This change will&#13;
     contribute to the integration of different agencies providing citizen services and will safeguard the privacy of citizensâ&#128;&#153; core data.&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:&#13;
     Although Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in poverty reduction and human development outcomes, extreme poverty and vulnerability remain stubborn&#13;
     problems. The country ranks sixth in the world on prevalence of stunting. The incidence of low birth weight is also among the highest at 22 percent, with maternal&#13;
     under-nutrition at about 24 percent. The poor, in particular, primarily experience under-nutrition. Despite the countryâ&#128;&#153;s achievements of increased access to education&#13;
     and gender parity, there are also marked disparities in participation and educational attainment rates for children in poor communities compared to their non-&#13;
     poor counterparts. Thus, improving nutrition and cognitive development opportunities for poor children is critical to arrest intergenerational transmission of poverty&#13;
     and presents an early window of opportunity to address inequality and improve outcomes for children later in life. Failure to invest adequately in the wellbeing of&#13;
     children from an early age has long-term implications for children and society as a whole, because it increases the likelihood of poverty in adulthood and perpetuates&#13;
     intergenerational transmission of poverty. By focusing on lifecycle vulnerabilities, social protection can serve to address vulnerabilities associated with a particular&#13;
     stage in life.&#13;
&#13;
     In order to address these challenges, the government will be implementing the International Development Association-supported Income Support Program for the&#13;
     Poorest Project -- a co-responsible cash transfer program that will provide income support to poor mothers in selected locations while: (i) increasing the mothersâ&#128;&#153; use&#13;
     of Child Nutrition and Cognitive Development services; and (ii) enhancing local-level capacity to deliver safety nets.&#13;
     Quarterly cash transfers will be made to eligible households based on their fulfillment of co-responsibilities linked to the growth and development of their young&#13;
     children (up to age 5). These include: (i) utilization of antenatal care services up to four times during pregnancy; (ii) use of growth monitoring and promotion services;&#13;
     and (iii) attendance at child nutrition and cognitive development awareness sessions. The average size of the monthly benefit is between $15-23, depending on the&#13;
     beneficiary profile, and falls within 20 percent of the estimated monthly per capita expenditure of the target population. In keeping with the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s family&#13;
     planning policy, only the first and second born children will be eligible, to help prevent distorted incentives.&#13;
&#13;
     The project will also provide technical assistance to the implementing agency to facilitate administration and implementation of the cash transfer program, which&#13;
     includes building partnerships with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for the use of community clinics to deliver services and with the Ministry of Post and&#13;
     Telecommunications for the use of biometric Post Office cash cards for beneficiary payments. A robust monitoring and evaluation framework has also been designed&#13;
     to assess progress in achieving the projectâ&#128;&#153;s objectives through third party monitoring and evaluate the impact of cash transfers on household poverty and childrenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     health outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Project locations have been identified based on poverty and malnutrition criteria. The project will be implemented in 42 upazilas (sub-districts) across northern&#13;
          Bangladesh reaching up to 600,000 mothers and their families.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Preparation activities are ongoing, with staffing and procurement activities underway. Conditional Cash Transfer program operations are tentatively scheduled to&#13;
          begin in July 2016.&#13;

technology (IT) industry sub-sector has remained relatively nascent as compared to the telecommunications sub-sector, with total industry output estimated at $300&#13;
million per annum. The government also recognizes the need to leverage electronic government (e-government) for public services delivery and to facilitate its reform&#13;
efforts. However the lack of shared IT hosting infrastructure, governance policies, and standards and structures present a major barrier to providing seamless electronic&#13;
services and improving the public sectorâ&#128;&#153;s effectiveness and efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
This project will support the development of Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s IT/IT Enabled Services (ITES) industry as the country possesses a comparative advantage in the sub-sector,&#13;
and the industry has been proven to have significant development impact in other developing countries. The project will also establish e-government foundations and&#13;
institutional capacity for the government to leverage this proven approach to support public sector modernization.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The project aims to catalyze growth of Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s IT and enabled services industry for employment creation and export diversification, and to establish basic&#13;
e-government foundations to support public-sector modernization. The projectâ&#128;&#153;s two main components are: (i) IT/ITES industry developmentâ&#128;&#153; and (ii) e-government.&#13;
The first component will increase the competitiveness of Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s IT/ITES industry by increasing the quantity and quality of skills, awareness and perception of&#13;
the country. This includes IT/ITES training for workers and middle management, institutional capacity building, and industry development strategy, branding and&#13;
promotion. The second component will provide critical e-government technological foundations to support public-sector modernization and the e-government&#13;
agenda for the years ahead, and build the human capacity to leverage technology within government. This includes expansion of the national datacenter, training&#13;
on e-government for relevant public officials, and establishing shared policies, standards and guidelines in enterprise architecture, interoperability framework, and&#13;
cybersecurity.&#13;
&#13;
EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Creating 30,000 direct IT/ITES jobs: Created 6,000 jobs to date.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improving Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s ranking on the World Economic Forumâ&#128;&#153;s Network Readiness Index by at least five places: Improved global ranking of 109 in 2015, from&#13;
     115 in 2012 and 113 in 2013.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Percentage of ministries using two or more e-government technology foundations established under the project: 11 percent of 50 percent to date.&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Despite strong economic growth and a steady decline in poverty in Bangladesh over the past decade, natural disasters regularly cause serious damage to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     infrastructure and agricultural sectors, severely affecting food access and food availability for the poor and vulnerable. The expected increase in the frequency and&#13;
     intensity of weather-related shocks makes it imperative that the government enhance its preparedness to address food insecurity in disaster-prone areas. The Public&#13;
     Food Distribution System (PFDS) is a core element of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s food security strategy. The modern food storage facilities proposed for construction under this&#13;
     project could considerably improve the efficacy of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s emergency response and recovery efforts in disaster-prone areas, and if grain stocks are properly&#13;
     managed, could enhance the efficiency of its PFDS at the same time.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The projectâ&#128;&#153;s overall objective is to increase the grain reserve available to households to meet post-disaster needs and improve the efficiency of grain storage&#13;
     management.&#13;
     Components include improving the storage capacity for grain by financing the construction of modern steel silos for rice and wheat that will be built in accordance&#13;
     with social and environmental sustainability parameters and safeguards compliance criteria. In addition, the project will facilitate householdsâ&#128;&#153; access to domestic silos&#13;
     for food grain and seed storage to improve household-level food security during and after natural disasters. It also will finance investments in small-scale storage at&#13;
     the rural household level, which is expected to bring important benefits to the farming community in the form of safer storage of rice seed. Another component will&#13;
     finance costs required to ensure adequate overall management of the project, monitoring and evaluation of the activities implemented, and capacity enhancement&#13;
     of selected stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
     EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Increased emergency grain storage capacity in central and household level storage (370,000 metric tons at the end of the project).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Direct project beneficiaries, (10 million, of which half are female).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Reduction in grain storage and handling losses in public storage facilities (by 50 percent).&#13;

&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
The longitudinal position of Bangladesh, combined with its proximity to the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, generate a tropical monsoon-type climate, prone to&#13;
cyclones, flooding, and drought. Bangladesh is also at risk for earthquakes and tsunamis, sitting at or near the juncture of several active tectonic boundaries. Cyclones&#13;
typically affect Bangladesh in the fall and spring, the intervals between the dry season and the monsoon season. North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur at least 500&#13;
kilometers (km) from the equator, a necessary prerequisite for a strong enough Coriolis force to sustain a low pressure center. Intensification of the storm transpires as&#13;
gradient wind balance concentrates latent heat near the core. Cyclones move northward where, almost every year, at least one makes landfall in Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
The coast of Bangladesh is approximately 710 km long and is home to nearly 40 million people. Cyclones affect the region with strong winds accompanied by powerful&#13;
storm surges and widespread inundation over a vast area. After the severe cyclone of 1970, which killed an estimated 300,000 people, the Government of Bangladesh&#13;
pledged to improve protection of the coastal population. In the subsequent decades, the government constructed a network of cyclone shelters in the coastal areas, and&#13;
developed an early warning system for local communities called the Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP). Between 1970 and 2007, around 1,700 cyclone shelters&#13;
were constructed, with the aim of providing protection from high winds and storm surges common during cyclones. The growing network of cyclone shelters and the&#13;
community-based early warning system has served to save lives and assets in the event of a natural disaster.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The development objective of this project is to reduce the vulnerability of the coastal population across selected coastal districts of Bangladesh to natural disasters. This&#13;
will be measured through an increase in the demand met for multipurpose disaster shelters in targeted districts. The objective will be achieved by improving existing&#13;
multi-purpose shelters, constructing new disaster shelters, and improving roads and connectivity in the area.&#13;
&#13;
The Multipurpose Disaster Shelters Project (MDSP) is a large-scale, disaster risk mitigation infrastructure project that strengthens emergency preparedness and will&#13;
significantly reduce vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. This builds on initial phases of interventions in multipurpose disaster shelters advanced&#13;
under Emergency 2007 Cyclone Recovery and Restoration Project (ECRRP), considered the first phase of investments. The project is expected to have an impact on long-&#13;
term disaster resiliency in Bangladesh, focused particularly on the coastal region. MDSP would focus on meeting these high priority needs by providing construction&#13;
of 552 new shelters and the improvement of 450 existing shelters. The project will also invest in connecting roads and communication networks to shelters, increasing&#13;
accessibility and effectiveness. It is expected that by safeguarding lives and assets, the project will contribute to goals of continued growth and shared prosperity.&#13;
&#13;
EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
The project is expected to benefit nearly 14 million people living in the nine coastal districts of Bangladesh by improving access to safe havens in the event of a natural&#13;
disaster. This would serve to build the resilience of local communities to such natural calamities, and help to speed recovery by protecting critical assets. In addition, the&#13;
project aims to construct multipurpose buildings, especially primary schools, and will thereby benefit the primary school age populations in these districts.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated and rapidly urbanizing countries in the world. The population density and high urban growth are putting great&#13;
     pressure on basic urban services, particularly on local governments, district towns or municipalities and city corporations that are entrusted to provide such services.&#13;
     Bangladesh has 331 urban local bodies (ULBs), comprising 10 city corporations and 321 municipalities. Despite progress in the decentralization reform agenda, the&#13;
     capacity of these urban institutions is still weak: they have limited fiscal autonomy and decision-making powers, inadequate own-source revenues, and weak systems&#13;
     of accountability. Infrastructure in these ULBs is very inadequate, and whatever assets they have are poorly maintained, if at all. The MGSP is designed to address weak&#13;
     governance and help infrastructure development and maintenance in participating ULBs. It is designed to provide incentives to ULBs that demonstrate significant&#13;
     improvements in planning, financial management, and accountability. The project is reaching out to ULBs through the Local Government Engineering Department&#13;
     (LGED) (for 26 selected ULBs in the Dhaka-Chittagong growth corridor) and through the Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund (BMDF) (under a grant-loan-equity&#13;
     subproject financing scheme) for ULBs that meet creditworthiness criteria. The project is also pursuing intensive capacity-building activities to enable ULBs to perform&#13;
     better and carry out their functions effectively. It also features a contingent emergency response component to enable ULBs to carry out disaster response activities if&#13;
     needed.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS:&#13;
     The project development objective is to improve municipal governance and basic urban services in participating ULBs, and to improve the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to&#13;
     respond effectively to emergencies. Into its second year of effectiveness, the project has initiated implementation of a number of small-scale infrastructure investments&#13;
     in the participating ULBs. These are mostly micro drains, road resurfacing, and construction of kitchen markets. In the 26 LGED ULBs, the operation and maintenance&#13;
     (O&amp;M) activities were supported on pilot basis, i.e., to allow these ULBs to prioritize O&amp;M activities through planning and integrating O&amp;M costs into their annual&#13;
     budget programs. Procurement of consultants to carry out activities that relate to the performance enhancement components (e.g., performance assessment, capacity-&#13;
     building consultants) as well as to prepare the BMDF road map for improving its operations is underway. Preparations for the conduct of third party monitoring have&#13;
     been initiated while the Country Investment Plan process has been carried out to improve the quality of subprojects to be supported by the MGSP. Improvements in&#13;
     the execution of the O&amp;M component are also being discussed with the ULBs. Bottlenecks in the procurement of key project inputs will need to be addressed to ensure&#13;
     that the project can achieve its objectives and keep implementation on track.&#13;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
National Agricultural Technology Program Phase II Project (NATP-2) builds on the successes of its predecessor NATP. It will support the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s strategic priorities&#13;
in agriculture, i.e., increasing production, achieving food security, supporting adaptation to climate change, and enhancing nutrition through safer and more&#13;
diversified food. The overarching principle of NATP-2 is to promote a more demand-driven approach to improvement of agricultural technology and modernization of&#13;
on-farm practices that takes into account the growing demand from consumers for safer food, as well as the needs of farmers for more diversified production. NATP-II&#13;
will contribute directly to the Ministry of Agricultureâ&#128;&#153;s (MoA) and the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestockâ&#128;&#153;s (MoFL) priority of increasing farm yields and diversifying&#13;
agricultural production by improving agricultural research and extension. Its dual field-level strategy will deepen the interventions initiated by the previous project in&#13;
existing sub districts and expand the geographic coverage to include new sub districts. NATP-II will cover 57 of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s 64 districts and span a broad range of agro-&#13;
ecological zones across Bangladesh. The project will be implemented over a six-year period in up to 270 of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s 493 sub-districts (or upazilas); this includes&#13;
107 upazilas already covered under NATP, plus up to 163 new upazilas. The primary project beneficiaries will be smallholder farmers (i.e., small, marginal and landless&#13;
farmers). The project will promote gender mainstreaming and womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment to ensure that a significant proportion of direct beneficiaries are female. Other&#13;
direct project beneficiaries include extension workers, agricultural researchers, and to a lesser extent, rural entrepreneurs.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVE:&#13;
The project development objective for NATP-2 is to increase agricultural productivity of small holdersâ&#128;&#153; farms and improve small-holder farmersâ&#128;&#153; access to markets in&#13;
selected districts.&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     The garment industry in Bangladesh accounts for 75 to 80 percent of Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s export earnings, and has also played a significant role in providing economic&#13;
     benefits to poor and vulnerable women. Today, around 80 percent of the garment workers are female. Yet, the number of poor women from impoverished north-&#13;
     western districts joining the garments sector is much lower than the number of women garment workers from other parts of the country. Female garment workers&#13;
     constitute a highly vulnerable group, with few support systems in place that provide them adequate training or social services. For these women, their first few months&#13;
     in the city and at the factory are the most hazardous, deterring many women who are in desperate need of work from joining the industry.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The Northern Areas Reduction of Poverty Initiative (NARI) aims to recruit 10,800 women from five districts in northern Bangladesh for an orientation course to help&#13;
     them make informed decisions about beginning a new life in one of three export processing zones (EPZs) in Dhaka, Karnaphuli, or Ishwardi. The women will be&#13;
     settled into newly built complexes, with transitional housing facilities at dormitories, giving them time to develop social networks and support systems. The project&#13;
     also provides three months of training in skills for the garment industry, allowing women to enter factories as semi-skilled workers. Trainees also will receive life-skills&#13;
     training, covering topics such as adjustment to city life, savings and remittances, safety and security, rights and responsibilities at the work-place, finding appropriate&#13;
     housing, contract negotiation, and health and fertility.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Three dormitories and training centers constructed.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The Information, Education Campaign to raise awareness in source areas, orient and recruit beneficiaries 	            launched and is nearing completion for the first&#13;
          group.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Dialogue launched for partnering with the biggest brands and buyers (H&amp;M, Walmart, Primark etc.) that 	               source ready-made garments from Bangladesh&#13;
          to leverage corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds for the operating costs of the project, and link the beneficiaries of the project with ongoing CSR activities at&#13;
          the factory 	     and community level.&#13;
&#13;
     EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The first 900 selected candidates will be inducted into the dormitories and training centers by mid-October 2015&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Around 10,800 women will gain formal employment, and networks will be established for continuing the flow of potential workers.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Three months of training will be provided and the employment bureaus will place the trainees into employment.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The women will also be accommodated in transitional housing facilities for six months.&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The Nuton Jibon Livelihood Improvement Project (NJLIP) is the follow-up project to the Empowerment and Livelihood Improvement â&#128;&#156;Nuton Jibonâ&#128;&#157; project, also called&#13;
Social Investment Program Project II (SIPP II), which will be closed on December 31, 2015. The predecessor project covered 3,262 villages in 16 districts where 92&#13;
percent of villages, (or 2,987 of the 3,262) are functioning in an inclusive, transparent, and accountable manner.&#13;
&#13;
The project will work on: (i) second generation activities in nine districts supported by SIPP II; (ii) development of villages supported by SIPP II and new villages in&#13;
seven districts; and (iii) development of villages in five new districts. A total of 4,315 villages (1,815 existing villages plus 2,500 new ones) will be covered under&#13;
this project. The non-negotiable project principles would be inclusion, equity, participation, transparency, and accountability, in addition to the 10 golden rules called&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Dosh Neetiâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
The project objective is to improve the livelihoods of extreme poor communities and to strengthen the community institutions in selected districts.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     In order to stimulate Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in export-oriented manufacturing, the Government of Bangladesh initiated an economic zones regime by&#13;
     enacting a law in 1980 under which Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA) was created. The objective was to promote investment, export, and job&#13;
     creation by providing serviced land, reliable infrastructure, and one-stop administrative support to the investors. Since then eight Export Processing Zones (EPZs) have&#13;
     been established across the country. Chittagong EPZ, the first economic zone in Bangladesh dedicated for export-oriented manufacturing industries, was established&#13;
     in 1983.&#13;
&#13;
     The EPZ model, catering mainly to export-oriented FDIs, has its limits in terms of cumulative impact and spillovers to the domestic economy by promoting better&#13;
     business environment to a broader investor clientele. As such, further improvements to the economic zones regime became an imperative for the economy to thrive. To&#13;
     meet the investment need of both overseas and domestic investors, the government moved into a more flexible and competitive Special Economic Zone (SEZ) regime&#13;
     and the Economic Zones Act sponsored by the World Bank Group was enacted by the Parliament in August 2010 and led to the creation of the Bangladesh Economic&#13;
     Zones Authority (BEZA).&#13;
     The World Bank Group, together with UKâ&#128;&#153;s Department for International Development (DFID), is supporting the government in developing Economic Zones through&#13;
     Bangladesh Private Sector Development Support Project. This project aims to create jobs and accelerate growth by promoting diversified private-sector investment,&#13;
     local and foreign. Specifically it aims to: (i) improve the business environment and access to serviced land through Economic Zones; (ii) invest in training schemes to&#13;
     make human resources more responsive to enterprise needs; and (iii) supports local private-sector capacity through product/process quality improvements.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The project objective is to facilitate investment in growth centers in the emerging manufacturing and services sectors of the economy, with a view to generating&#13;
     employment.&#13;
&#13;
     The project promotes private sector investment by improving the business environment and access to industrial land through economic zones. It also supports the&#13;
     government in establishing private sector-led economic zones through public private partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Generated $12 million in direct investment in the economic zones, against a target of $10 million.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Created 1,023 new jobs, of which 26.7 percent are for women, against a target of 2,000 jobs by June 2016 (30 percent for women).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    BEZA completed feasibility studies for four economic zone sites, with one in Mongla awarded to the private sector.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    BEZA also issued license to establish three private sector-led SEZs in different parts of Bangladesh.&#13;

&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Public procurement expenditures constitute over 70 percent of the annual development program (ADP) in Bangladesh. Thus procurement plays a pivotal role in&#13;
the development agenda of the government. It is well documented that weaknesses in public procurement have a cumulative negative effect on investment and&#13;
economic growth. Poor public procurement skews investment toward areas where rent-seeking is prevalent, rather than toward the areas that need it most for poverty&#13;
reduction and development. Procurement was identified as the main reason for poor utilization of aid and development programs in the country. Given this context,&#13;
the government initiated a systemic procurement reform in the country starting 2002, with the focus on legislation, followed by extensive capacity development,&#13;
electronic procurement, and performance measurement.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The Public Procurement Reform Project II (PPRP-II) aims to improve the performance of the public procurement system, focusing largely on the key sectoral ministries&#13;
and their implementing agencies. It follows on the successes of the first PPRP that supported the enactment of procurement laws and rules. The four components of&#13;
PPRP II deal with comprehensive capacity development, procurement performance monitoring, electronic procurement, and social accountability.&#13;
&#13;
Besides Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU), the nodal procurement agency, four key government agencies that share large part of the annual development&#13;
program are involved â&#128;&#147; the Roads and Highways Department, Local Government Engineering Department, Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board, and Bangladesh&#13;
Water Development Board. They processed over 90 percent of FY2015 procurement through electronic tendering with a target of 100 percent by 2016, including on-&#13;
line procurement performance monitoring. In addition, PPRP-II has been implementing a comprehensive capacity-building program along with a social accountability&#13;
and behavioral change communications campaign to demystify procurement at the grassroots level.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Invited over 90 percent of tenders through electronic procurement in four key agencies in 2014, up from 3 percent in 2012.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Awarded 79 percent of small-value contracts at decentralized levels within the initial bid validity period in 2013, up from 10 percent in 2007.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Published 100 percent of contracts awards in e-Government Procurement (eGP), up from 15 percent in 2007 in traditional/manual tender.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Published 100 percent of tender invitations in e-GP in 2015, up from 70 percent in 2007 in manual tenders.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Trained more than 11,000 officials,; 6,500 of them were provided with a three-week procurement course.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     In 2010, nearly five million primary school-aged children were out of school in Bangladesh â&#128;&#147; many of these children had never enrolled, while others had dropped out&#13;
     before completing the primary cycle due to poverty. Children from the poorest quintile were reported to be disproportionately left out of the schooling system. As a&#13;
     consequence, these children were deprived of an education, reducing their chances of finding higher-earning jobs that could lift them and their families out of poverty.&#13;
     Building on the success of the first Reaching Out-of-School Children (ROSC) project, ROSC II provides a second chance at primary education to restore that opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The project aims to improve equitable access, retention and completion in quality primary education for out-of-school children in selected under-served areas.&#13;
&#13;
     ROSC II reintegrates out-of-school children into the education system through learning centers called Ananda schools (schools of joy), which are established in selected&#13;
     upazilas (sub-districts) with high-poverty and low-enrollment and completion rates. As ROSC students tend to be older, teachers observe a flexible schedule, with&#13;
     students taught by a single class teacher until they are ready to join mainstream secondary schools. These centers also provide education stipends to students to lessen&#13;
     the financial burden on families, in addition to providing free books, stationery, and school uniforms. The project builds upon the experiences of both public and non-&#13;
     governmental organization (NGOs) provision of education and blends formal education with non-formal means of delivery to the young learners, providing them with&#13;
     an opportunity to complete grade five and transition to secondary education. The project also tries to empower disadvantaged rural communities to establish, own,&#13;
     and manage Ananda schools with support from the government and local education NGOs. In addition, the project aims to pilot initiatives in selected urban slums for&#13;
     child domestics, a pre-vocational skills training scheme for older ROSC students, and an Early Grade Reading program for current ROSC students.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Enrollment of 616,042 out-of-school children (49 percent girls and 87 percent from disadvantaged families) in in 20,076 supported learning centers in 148 of&#13;
          the most disadvantaged upazilas and selected urban slums of Dhaka.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Average grade retention rate stands at 62 percent, with the attendance rate at 86 percent and teacher absence rate below 15 percent.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Most Ananda schools have water and sanitation facilities, and 80 percent of teachers at them are women.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    For the first time, ROSC students participated in the 2013 national learning assessment for primary level.&#13;

&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Low revenue mobilization in Bangladesh is a critical constraint to the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s development aspirations. The level of tax collection was 10.4 percent of gross&#13;
domestic product in 2012 and has remained at that level over the last few years. Additional problems in tax administration include manual systems, governance issues&#13;
and lack of skilled staff. A new value-added tax law to take effect in 2016 will broaden the base, increase the VAT yield and contribute towards the establishment of a&#13;
modern and service-oriented VAT administration. The program goes beyond the introduction of the new tax administration software. It supports the restructuring of the&#13;
VAT wing and the re-engineering of key business processes and strengthens reporting to the public on performance and complaints-handling, along with providing&#13;
greater transparency of the administration.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The objective is to improve revenue mobilization and transparency in the VAT administration.&#13;
&#13;
The project seeks to strengthen organization of the core VAT functional areas including: VAT tax registration; tax return filing and processing; tax payment; taxpayer&#13;
accounting; tax refund; tax audit; tax collection and enforcement; tax appeal; and taxpayer services. It also will develop and deploy an integrated VAT management&#13;
system that will establish a central processing center and a contact center operated by the private sector on contract. In addition to enhancing revenue mobilization,&#13;
the project supports the greater transparency of the VAT administration. This will be done through making the VAT wing fully compliant with the Right to Information&#13;
Act, 2009.&#13;
&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     National rural water supply coverage in Bangladesh is estimated to be around 97 percent, but water quality issues and contamination by arsenic have effectively&#13;
     lowered this figure to around 83 percent. Arsenic is the single largest threat to safe water service provision in Bangladesh. The quality of sanitation coverage is another&#13;
     area of concern, with only 37 percent of latrines being hygienic. The poor infrastructure and facilities for water and sanitation services, along with increased demand,&#13;
     is making it difficult to provide reliable water and sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The project aims to increase the provision of safe water supply and hygienic sanitation in selected rural areas of Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
     It calls for scaling up piped and non-piped water facilities to provide safe and clean water to villagers in some 383 Union Parishads (local governing units) with acute&#13;
     arsenic contamination and low coverage for safe water supply. The project also seeks to provide hygienic sanitation facilities, and is financing the construction of 35&#13;
     piped water supply schemes and 14,000 water point sources in hot-spot upazilas (subdistricts) where piped water supply is not economically possible. To fight the poor&#13;
     sanitation, it intends to provide financial incentives for the poor to construct hygienic latrines, build local private-sector capacity so that markets can better react to rise&#13;
     in demand; and increase the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s role in ensuring that latrines are maintained and accessible to all. The project is financing installation of 50,000 latrines&#13;
     for selected poor households.&#13;
&#13;
     ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     63,250 out of target 924,000 people in rural areas have been provided with access to improved water sources.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     1,150 out of 14,000 improved community water points constructed under the project.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     28,000 new piped household water connections to be provided from the project.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     7,964 people out of 275,000 have been provided with access to hygienic latrines.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Total 71,214 direct project beneficiaries out of target 1.2 million people in rural areas have been provided with access to improved water sources and hygienic&#13;
           latrines.&#13;

&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Only about 45 percent of rural households in Bangladesh have access to grid electricity, and even these consumers suffer frequent and prolonged power cuts. Currently,&#13;
electricity supply is about 6,500-7,000 megawatts (MW), against a peak demand of about 8,500 MW. The dispersed nature of rural settlements and the numerous&#13;
rivers that crisscross the country make grid electrification in many areas of Bangladesh both difficult and expensive. Despite steady progress in enhancing coverage, it&#13;
is clear that reliance on grid electricity alone will not allow the Bangladeshi government to realize its vision of universal access to electricity by 2021.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The second Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development (RERED) project aims to increase access to clean energy in rural areas of Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
It builds on the success of RERED I by supporting solar home systems and other renewable energy options in remote rural areas, where grid electricity is not&#13;
economically or geographically viable. The World Bank initiative led to support from other donors, with more than 40,000 solar homes systems now being installed&#13;
every month to make it the fastest-growing solar home systems program in the world. The implementing agency is the Infrastructure Development Company Ltd.&#13;
(IDCOL), a government-owned financing institution, and 47 partner organizations (mostly non-government organizations) are installing solar home systems through&#13;
a micro-credit scheme The project is also supporting renewable energy-based mini-grids, solar irrigation pumps (replacing diesel pumps), dissemination of improved&#13;
cook stoves, and biogas digesters for cooking following the same implementation model as that of the solar home systems.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Provided 3.77 million remote households and rural shops with solar home systems, with more than 40,000 systems now installed every month.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increased access to electricity in Bangladesh by 13 percent. Dissemination of improved cook stoves has started with a target of reaching one million rural house-&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Only about 45 percent of rural households in Bangladesh have access to grid electricity, and even these consumers suffer frequent and prolonged power cuts. Currently,&#13;
     electricity supply is about 6,500-7,000 megawatts (MW), against a peak demand of about 8,500 MW. Despite the supply shortages, electricity availability and the&#13;
     number of consumers have grown steadily over the last decade because of reduced system loss and some added generating capacity. While the government and other&#13;
     sources made substantial investments to extend the rural low-voltage system network to support new connections, the rural medium-voltage distribution system and&#13;
     the associated transmission system received relatively less attention during the last decade of system load and grid expansion. As a result, the rural electricity system&#13;
     is now over-loaded and experiences frequent load-shedding, leading to higher technical losses and services interruptions.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The objective is to reduce system losses and enhance capacity in the rural distribution network, primarily in the eastern part of Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
     The project aims to rehabilitate and augment the distribution network of the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB) in support of reducing systems losses and&#13;
     enhancing capacity for carrying electricity when additional power generation is available. The project is also expected to support transmission enhancements by the&#13;
     Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB).&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     Construction work is yet to start. Procurement of line materials has started with $64 million of line materials either awarded or evaluation completed. Bid documents&#13;
     for sub-stations are in the final stage of preparation.&#13;

&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Within Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s public sector, local governments have always been relatively minor players, with a tiny share of sub-national expenditure to the total government&#13;
expenditure and a more trivial percentage of the total government revenue collected. Nonetheless, local governments â&#128;&#147; especially at the lowest tiers â&#128;&#147; are key features&#13;
of the governance landscape. In recent initiatives, successive governments have affirmed their intent to devolve powers to lower levels and allocate more autonomy&#13;
and resources to local governments. Changes have shown that empowered Union Parishads (UPs, the lowest tier of local governments) and engaged constituents can&#13;
make effective decisions, both transparently and accountably. Consequently, there is an increasingly strong government-led push towards decentralization. The First&#13;
Local Governance Support Project (LGSP I; $170 million), the first nationwide effort to strengthen the local government system in Bangladesh, has been successful&#13;
in achieving its development objectives of strengthening local governments that provide accountable services, and has created the space for deeper decentralization&#13;
reforms.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The Second Local Governance Support Project (LGSP II), building upon the success of its preceding project LGSP I, aims to strengthen Union Parishads to become&#13;
accountable and responsive, supported by an efficient and transparent intergovernmental fiscal system to Union Parishads. With a nationwide coverage to all 4,542&#13;
UPs (about 130 million people), LGSP II provides direct block grants to be distributed to the UPs with a clean audit issued by private auditors, along with full discretion&#13;
to decide their spending priorities; and the project introduced a nationwide performance grant system with clear criteria and transparent assessment. Through a&#13;
participatory process involving open planning and budget sessions, members can debate spending needs and question spending efficacy. The project strengthens the&#13;
capabilities of UPs in participatory planning, budgeting, financial management and procurement, also ensures UPs are held accountable through independent audits&#13;
and disclosure requirements.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Disbursed an equivalent of $314.2 million through FY2015. Performance Based Grants disbursement (amount of $38.8 million) has been made to better per-&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Despite remarkable progress in poverty reduction, extreme poverty in Bangladesh remains high, with large numbers of people vulnerable to systemic shocks. The&#13;
     Government of Bangladesh recognizes that shocks and vulnerability are mainstream problems for the poor and currently implements several safety net programs&#13;
     as response measures. Well- designed and implemented safety nets not only reduce poverty and vulnerability but have shown to improve womenâ&#128;&#153;s well being. Yet&#13;
     despite the numerous ongoing interventions, large numbers of poor people remain out of reach of safety nets. There is a scope for better targeting of benefits in some&#13;
     of the largest programs, improving delivery mechanisms and monitoring systems, as well as enhancing accountability measures. Cognizant of these challenges,&#13;
     the Ministry of Disaster Management &amp; Relief (MoDMR), which implements approximately one-third of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s social protection budget, is currently utilizing&#13;
     International Development Association resources to improve performance of its major programs. The Statistics &amp; Informatics Division (SID) is also supporting this&#13;
     process, given its mandate to develop a national poverty database towards better targeting of social assistance, which in the medium term is also expected to improve&#13;
     the quality of a significant portion of public expenditure on safety net programs.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The Safety Net Systems for the Poorest (SNSP) project aims to improve the equity, efficiency, and transparency of major social safety net programs to benefit the poorest&#13;
     households. The project comprises three components, namely:&#13;
&#13;
     Component 1: Support to MoDMR Safety Net Programs by providing performance-based partial reimbursement of government spending under selected safety net&#13;
     programs.&#13;
     Component 2: Strengthening of MoDMR Program Administration &amp; Transparency by providing resources to improve implementation quality, including the&#13;
     development of management information systems, beneficiary outreach and engagement strategies, and training, towards the achievement of higher-level objectives.&#13;
     Component 3: Development of the Bangladesh Poverty Database by providing resources to conduct a nationwide census, establish a comprehensive targeting system,&#13;
     and contribute to improving coordination among various safety nets implemented by different ministries.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improved targeting of financial resources of major safety net programs.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improved field level implementation and monitoring capacity for major safety net programs.&#13;

&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Special measures taken over the last couple of decades have enabled more Bangladeshi children than before, especially girls, to continue their education at the&#13;
secondary level. But it still remains a challenge for children from low-income families to access a good-quality education in Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The Secondary Education Quality and Access Enhancement Project (SEQAEP) aims to improve the quality of secondary education in Bangladesh, systematically monitor&#13;
learning outcomes and increase access and equity in 215 project upazilas (sub-districts).&#13;
&#13;
The project provides stipends and tuition to disadvantaged girls and boys based on proxy means-testing (PMT), in addition to incentives to students, teachers, and&#13;
schools in 215 upazilas to encourage them to perform better. Eligible students receive stipends of $15 to $40 a year if they maintain 75 percent average attendance,&#13;
achieve a passing grade in final examinations and remain unmarried until they complete Grade 10.&#13;
&#13;
The project also includes measures to provide water and sanitation facilities in schools, and strengthen school management and accountability systems while helping&#13;
to develop stronger reading habits. Financial rewards are given to the teachers and institutions that consistently increase the number of students appearing in and&#13;
passing the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The pass rate in SSC examinations was higher than 85 percent.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Supported 6.5 million student-years (55 percent girls) under the stipends program.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    More than 2,700 institutions were supported under the SSC institution award.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Awarded more than 139,000 students for academic performance while supporting some 448,000 students in English and mathematics and about 968,000&#13;
     students in developing a reading habit.&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Despite a wide road network and large investments in it, rural roads in Bangladesh need regular repair and rehabilitation. The quality, construction, and carrying&#13;
     capacity of parts of the secondary and tertiary road network are poor. In 2000, only 37 percent of the population lived within two kilometers (km) of an all-season road.&#13;
     About 13,000 km of upazila (sub-district) roads (out of 36,500 km) were all-weather standard, and most of the rural union roads remained unpaved. As a result, large&#13;
     portions of the secondary and tertiary road network remained impassable during the rainy season.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The second Rural Transport Improvement Project (RTIP II) aims to improve rural accessibility in project areas (covering 26 districts), and to strengthen institutional&#13;
     capacity for sustainable rural road maintenance. It builds on the success of RTIP 1, which covered more than 44,000 square km in 21 districts, in developing rural&#13;
     trade and transport infrastructure by focusing on the physical improvements of inter-linked roads, small bridges and culverts, growth center markets, and river jetties.&#13;
&#13;
     The projectâ&#128;&#153;s improved roads, many built by destitute women, make it easier for children to go to school, expectant mothers to reach hospitals in an emergency, and&#13;
     local farmers and consumers to reach markets. It also has contributed to developing a comprehensive rural road transport safety framework to help reduce the alarming&#13;
     number of injuries and fatalities, and expanded coverage to improve road connectivity in the countryside&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    RTIP II has completed a total of 1,650 km of roads (against a target of 3,583 km)..&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    114 km of performance-based maintenance contract roads have been completed (a fourth of the target length of 450 km).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Work on one pilot inland waterway and 16 Growth Centre Markets is ongoing.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) has signed most of the consultancy contracts under the institutional strengthening and capacity building and&#13;

&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Electricity demand in Bangladesh has increased at an average rate of 10 percent per annum in recent years, with peak demand reaching about 9,250 megawatts (MW).&#13;
Yet per capita generation remains among the lowest in the world (294 kilowatt hours), and present generation capability at 8,000 MW falls far short of peak demand.&#13;
Although the supply situation has improved recently, load shedding and outages occur in irrigation/summer season that affect households, commercial enterprises,&#13;
and industries. The sector is financially weak, access to capital is severely constrained and prices do not cover costs, necessitating large government subsidies to keep&#13;
the key institutions operational. Increasing shortages of natural gas, the primary fuel for power generation, have added to the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s challenges.&#13;
&#13;
PRIMARY DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The Siddhirganj Power Project aims to increase electricity supply to the Bangladesh power-grid network by constructing a 335 MW combined cycle power plant, (CCPP)&#13;
as well as an 11-kilometer 230-kilovolt power evacuation system, and a 60 km 30-inch gas transmission pipeline. The combined cycle design of the power plant is a&#13;
comparatively cleaner technology with lower carbon emissions and higher thermal efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
In November of this year, the simple cycle power plant is expected to add 217 MW of electricity generating capacity to the national grid. The balance of plant of the&#13;
combined cycle is scheduled to complete in August 2016 when it will add total 335 MW capacity to the grid. Construction of the power evacuation system is complete,&#13;
and it is transferring 235 MW of electricity from the other power plants of Siddhirganj to the greater Dhaka area. The gas line is almost complete and has improved&#13;
the gas supply situation in the Siddhirganj region. The government is working to secure an additional $165 million to finance the additional capital cost of the CCPP&#13;
and associated supports.&#13;

     INTRODUCTION:&#13;
     The Bangladesh economy has been registering steady economic growth of around 6 percent over the past decade. As local and global economic shifts continue toward&#13;
     industry and services, demand for skilled manpower is expected to rise at home and abroad. Bangladesh is a labor-surplus country, so the government is increasingly&#13;
     focusing on workforce development through technical and vocational education training (TVET). This is a timely response as the country prepares to accommodate&#13;
     and capitalize on the ongoing demographic dividend. However, poor training quality, low employability, and inadequate wages plague the TVET sector, requiring&#13;
     interventions for addressing these issues.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE:&#13;
     The project aims to strengthen selected public and private training institutions to improve training quality and employability of trainees, including those from&#13;
     disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The project is designed to address the key issues concerning TVET in a number of ways:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Ensuring that the programs offered are relevant to labor market needs by incorporating views from industries and civil society.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Helping to ensure teacher-trainer vacancies open for six months or more are filled.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Supporting both public and private institutions, thereby creating a level playing field. The project breaks new ground in this way.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Providing incentives. Based on performance indicators, training institutions will receive a $200,000 performance grant, on top of their initial implementation&#13;
          grant of up to $1 million. Institutions providing short courses receive $250 per student, of which $60 is stipend to the student. In addition, a 20 percent per&#13;
          student amount performance grant is offered to the institute for each trainee who is employed within six months of completing training.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Providing stipends to students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Those receiving a stipend must maintain 75 percent annual attendance and 45&#13;
          percent pass marks in the annual examinations.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    96, 345 diploma students from 93 polytechnic institutions (43 of which are public) received stipends. The share of female beneficiaries increased from 10 to 15&#13;
          percent after a universal female stipend.was adopted.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    980 full-time contractual teachers deployed in 50 public polytechnics, filling 95 percent of vacant teaching posts.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    46,076 people, 25 percent of them women, received training from these providers..&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL), a program that certifies informal workers who have acquired skills from job experience or any other non-formal source, has&#13;
          been operationalized. Around 2,000 individuals have been assessed through RPL.&#13;

PROGRAM BACKGROUND:&#13;
The main public financial management challenges are the development of a comprehensive, automated financial management information system with appropriate&#13;
controls, the development of a new chart of accounts, low levels of professional budgeting, accounting and auditing capacity, a dual budgeting process, lack of&#13;
timeliness in preparing audit reports and low capacity for budget oversight, and low levels of fiscal transparency. To address these challenges in a harmonized manner,&#13;
five partners came together to establish a trust fund in 2008. To date, $101 million has been received.&#13;
&#13;
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Program seeks to: (i) strengthen and modernize budget management institutions within the Government&#13;
of Bangladesh, with a particular emphasis on introducing a performance orientation in public financial management; and (ii) improve the effectiveness of formal&#13;
institutions of financial accountability through strengthening both the capacity of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG) and the functioning of&#13;
parliament bodies that deal with allocation and monitoring of government resources. The program financed:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The now-closed Deepening Medium Term Budgeting Framework and Strengthening Financial Accountability project ($52.5 million), which aimed to improve the&#13;
     financial management information system, introduce a multi-year perspective to budget preparation, provide professional training, and strengthen the macro-&#13;
     fiscal framework.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The Strengthening of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General project ($13.03 million), which intends to enhance the quality, scope and follow-up of&#13;
     audits, and create a cadre of internationally accredited professionals in OCAG.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The Strengthening Parliamentary Oversight project ($4.2 million), which provides technical support to the three financial oversight committees and the Parlia-&#13;
     mentary Secretariat.&#13;
The series of advisory services and analytics activities are underway: developing macroeconomic forecasting capacity at the Finance Division; strengthening budget&#13;
management preparation in four key line ministries; launching a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment; developing a new public financial&#13;
management strategy and roadmap; launching the public investment management reform roadmap; and developing the government performance management&#13;
system. The SPEMP Trust Fund will close on December 2016.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Audit capacity strengthened, twinning arrangement signed between Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) of India and Bangladesh to generate greater collaboration&#13;
     between the two countries.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    16 Financial Oversight Committee reports have been made available on the Parliament website against a target of 12. In addition, the new management informa-&#13;
     tion system is ready for user testing,&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Annual performance agreements (APAs) are completed for FY 2014/2015 and are currently under evaluation. FY 2015-2016 APAs being prepared.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Training has been provided the macro forecasting wing of the Finance Division and the model further developed.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    PEFA assessment was launched.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Technical assistance team has started inception phase for the supporting the budget preparation for four line ministries.&#13;

&#13;
PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Illegal trade in wildlife is largely controlled by criminal gangs that poach flagship species, such as tigers and elephants in one country, stockpile them in another, and then trade&#13;
them beyond the South Asia region. Thus, no single country can manage or eliminate poaching or the illegal wildlife trade on its own. Since wild animals cannot be confined to&#13;
national boundaries, a single country also cannot manage a contiguous cross-border wildlife habitat effectively. This makes the control of the illegal trade of wildlife and wildlife&#13;
parts a challenging multi-country affair.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The project aims to assist participating governments in building or enhancing shared capacity, institutions, knowledge and incentives to collaborate on tackling the illegal wildlife&#13;
trade and other selected regional conservation threats to habitats in border areas. It has a two-pronged approach that calls for: (i) capacity building to address the illegal wildlife&#13;
trade through regional cooperation; and (ii) habitat protection and management to generate regional conservation benefits and address the human-wildlife conflict.&#13;
Components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;  Building capacity to address the illegal trans-boundary wildlife trade by bringing about regional collaboration in combating wildlife crime through strengthened legislative&#13;
   and regulatory frameworks and well-equipped specialized agencies and systems, as well as relevant training and awareness programs for staff responsible for enforcement&#13;
   of wildlife laws and regulations. Bangladesh and Nepal are participating in the first phase (with the Nepal project amounting to $3 million) and Bhutan joined in the second&#13;
   phase.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;  Promoting wildlife conservation in Asia through establishing a virtual regional center of excellence; improving existing park infrastructure; conducting species monitoring&#13;
   and recovery programs; preparing and implementing endangered species recovery plans; protecting inviolate areas for species conservation; implementing real-time&#13;
   field-based monitoring systems; developing landscape scale imaging platforms; strengthening enforcement of laws and regulations; and carrying out innovative research&#13;
   projects in wildlife conservation.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Drafted 18 rules for operationalization of Wildlife Conservation Act, 2010.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Established a 24-hour hotline for reporting of illegal wildlife trafficking and other wildlife-related crimes to the Wildlife Crime Control Unit (WCCU) at the Forest Department&#13;
       Headquarter and Divisional Offices.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      WCCU arrested 375 wildlife offenders and rescued 6,183 birds, 9,539 reptiles, and 177 mammals.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Completed the first census of Bengal tigers in the Sundarbans through a collaborative effort with the Wildlife Institute of India; estimated a tiger population of 106 in the&#13;
       Sundarbans using camera trapping method.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Declared two Vulture Safe Zones in Bangladesh.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Commenced implementation of 36 sub-projects aiming at improving the management of protected areas, conservation of flagship species and reduce human-wildlife&#13;
       conflict.&#13;

&#13;
PROGRAM BACKGROUND:&#13;
Bangladesh had made remarkable progress in primary education in the last decade. The net enrollment rate (NER) reached around 98 percent while the gross enrollment&#13;
rate (GER) reached above 108 percent in 2014, and gender parity was achieved. The completion rate was 79 percent in 2014 and the survival rate to Grade 5 is 81 percent.&#13;
Despite the impressive progress, transition rate to secondary level remain a concern. Poverty along with educational background of the family, remoteness of the society,&#13;
and distance from the school, were the main reasons for dropping out. The quality of education remained a bigger concern; many schools were overcrowded, while teacher&#13;
qualifications and motivation remained low and exams mostly tested memory recall and rote learning.&#13;
&#13;
PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
The Third Primary Education Development Program (PEDP3) aims at increased participation and reduced social disparities in primary education, increased completion of&#13;
primary education, improved quality of the learning environment, systematic assessment of student learning, and improved effectiveness of resource utilization at the&#13;
primary education sector. The program has introduced a comprehensive set of reforms to upgrade the quality of learning for all children at the primary and preprimary level,&#13;
strengthened capacity to provide high-quality data and utilization of information for effective results monitoring, brought disadvantaged children into pre-primary and&#13;
primary education, and developed mechanisms for the public and private sectors to work more closely together in education service delivery.&#13;
The program builds on the experience and successes of previous programs but stands out from them because its financing is linked to specific results being achieved&#13;
on the ground. Funds are disbursed when disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) covering nine areas are met. The DLIs for quality enhancement cover: (i) development&#13;
of an 18-month diploma program and teacher training; (ii) the development and incremental introduction of competency-based examinations; (iii) merit-based teacher&#13;
and head teacher recruitment; and (iv) timely distribution of textbooks (within a month of the start of the academic calendar), including an updated curriculum. The DLIs&#13;
supporting reduction in disparities include: (i) the widespread introduction of pre-primary education, especially in disadvantaged areas; and (ii) needs-based infrastructure&#13;
development to reduce overcrowding in schools and improve the quality of the facilities as well as school-level planning. Two other DLIs are set for enhanced sector financing&#13;
and effective program monitoring and reporting.&#13;
The World Bank is also the supervising entity for a Global Partnership for Education grant of $100 million for PEDP3.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    31 out of the 36 DLIs met to date.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Completion of two rounds of the National Student Assessment (Grades 3 and 5) in 2011 and 2013.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Large-scale tryout of revised textbooks and teachersâ&#128;&#153; editions (all subjects, Grades 1-5).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Teacher recruitment and deployment completed according to merit-based recruitment procedures and on needs basis.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    International standard diploma in education piloted and expanded nationwide (accredited by the University of Dhaka).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Launch of an on-line data collection and management system to help in the preparation of an online Annual Primary School Census and testing real time availability&#13;
     of the data.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Use of existing country system and fiduciary arrangements.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Launch of nationwide electronic government procurement for construction works.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Over 90 percent of primary schools received textbooks within the first month of the academic year and the textbook distribution process is satisfactorily monitored&#13;
     through third party validation.&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Bangladesh is the terminal floodplain delta of three large rivers: the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna â&#128;&#147; with over 90 percent of their catchment areas&#13;
     situated outside the country. Each year during the monsoon season, 20 percent to 30 percent of Bangladesh is flooded. While this creates opportunities for highly&#13;
     productive farming and fishing systems, these are balanced by the risks of deep flooding, erosion, and drainage. By contrast, in the post-monsoon period, soil-moisture&#13;
     content declines rapidly and the water deficit needs to be compensated by irrigation. Salinity intrusion, water-logging and the arsenic contamination of groundwater&#13;
     aquifers further exacerbate the problem. Much work has been done in recent decades to prepare for disasters, but water management remains a critical issue.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND COMPONENTS:&#13;
     The Water Management Improvement Project (WMIP) aims to enhance water resources management in Bangladesh by upgrading infrastructure and institutions&#13;
     through rehabilitating damaged water infrastructure, piloting the role of local communities and enhancing the institutional performance of the principal water&#13;
     institutions, particularly the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and the Water Resource Planning Organization (WARPO).&#13;
&#13;
     It supports the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s goal to decentralize the authority of the BWDB and hand over its management responsibilities to community organizations, where&#13;
     feasible. By taking the emphasis off flood control and focusing more on water management, the project shifts responsibility from technicians and bureaucrats to a wide&#13;
     variety of community stakeholders who may participate at any stage of the project development cycle. It also aims to rehabilitate the BWDB schemes damaged by the&#13;
     2007 floods, and later by a 2009 cyclone, and to reform government institutions involved in the water sector by improving governance and transparency to enhance&#13;
     their ability to better manage water systems.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Repair or reconstruction of 716 kilometers (km) of embankments, 315 water control structures, 41 km of protective works and 341km re-excavation of canals.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    500,000 households directly benefitted.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Creation of 12 million person-days of employment.&#13;

            Bangladesh - Country snapshot
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Rapid growth has propelled Bangladesh
            from low-income to low-middle-income country (LMIC) status,
            as FY2014 per capita gross national income (GNI) of $1,080
            crossed the middle-income country threshold of $1,046.
            Several factors are behind the resilience of Bangladesh’s
            economy, against the backdrop of a volatile global economy.
            Progress on reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared
            prosperity through human development and employment
            generation has continued. This needs to be further
            consolidated in the near term by sustaining gross domestic
            product (GDP) and remittances growth, creating jobs,
