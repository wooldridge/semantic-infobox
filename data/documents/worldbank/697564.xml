Note No. 40   Franchising and Privatization&#13;
Antony W Dnes   Increasing private sector participation to improve the efficiency of infrastructure services is a&#13;
growing trend around the world. This trend reflects dissatisfaction with state solutions, ever-&#13;
tightening government budgets, technical change, and policy innovation. One approach to in-&#13;
creasing private participation that is attracting much interest is franchise bidding schemes.&#13;
Improved understanding of franchise contracting techniques could foster the successful revival&#13;
and development of Sir Edwin Chadwick's idea of competition for the field.&#13;
Competition for the field                 the most attractive terms-for example, the&#13;
lowest price to consumers. Competition&#13;
Some elements of most infrastructure activities  through bidding ensures minimum selling&#13;

Guinea, Hungary, and Mexico. In a recent case&#13;
Sir Edwin Chadwick, a Victorian social re-   closely resembling the Chadwick/Demsetz pro-&#13;
former, proposed a franchise solution to prob-   posal, Buenos Aires awarded a water conces-&#13;
lems of natural monopoly, an approach later  sion to the company offering the lowest&#13;

States.' Chadwick distinguished between com-   or more below the price previously charged&#13;
petition "within the field" and "competition   by the state-owned water company.&#13;
for the field." Where competition is not pos-&#13;
sible within an industry, Chadwick surmised,   Natural monopoly&#13;

In franchising schemes, competition for the&#13;
market can occur "on paper" without the need&#13;
Chaduick distinguished between                            for anyone to incur irrecoverable (specific) in-&#13;
vestments. A franchise authority simply awards&#13;

state to nationalize the natural monopoly, which&#13;
may be an adequate substitute.                            is how gas, water, electricity, and telecommu-&#13;

that private enterprise can reduce costs. The&#13;
catch is that many rail services run at a loss,&#13;
and therefore it is unlikely that private inves-&#13;

would award rail routes to companies bidding&#13;
for the lowest subsidy to operate the service&#13;
for a specified period, and subject the winning&#13;
companies to a requirement to not increase&#13;
fares in order to maintain the existing level and&#13;
quality of service. This scheme, which uses&#13;
competitive bidding to minimize subsidies&#13;
rather than prices, is a variant of the original&#13;
Chadwick scheme.&#13;

            Increasing private sector participation
            to improve the efficiency of infrastructure services is a
            growing trend around the world. Some elements of most
            infrastructure activities exhibit "natural
            monopoly" characteristics, meaning that one or more
            services or products can be produced most cheaply by a
            single firm. This raises the issues of organizing an
            infrastructure industry so as to gain the advantages of
            production by a single firm, without encouraging
            monopolistic conduct. This Note discusses a franchise
            approach to problems of natural monopoly--franchise bidding
            schemes--proposed by Sir Edwin Chadwick, a Victorian social
            reformer and later promoted by Harold Demsetz in the United
            States. The essential idea is that monopoly franchises could
            be auctioned off to the bidder offering the most attractive
            terms. Competition through bidding ensures minimum selling
            prices because the winning franchise will lower prices until
            revenues just cover costs. Franchise schemes also may avoid
            pitfalls associated with traditional regulation of such
            industries or with their nationalization. The Note also
            discusses the advantages of a franchise system and the
            importance of contract design to a successful franchise system.
