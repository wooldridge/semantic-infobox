THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: OECD high income&#13;

Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 47,380&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 10&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 10*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at th e bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;
qualitative information on the mechanisms put in           duration and frequency of power outages in the largest&#13;
place by the utility for monitoring power outages          business city of each economy (for 11 economies the data&#13;
and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;
greater transparency of tariffs.&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

       The seller and buyer notarize the deed of sale with an attesting&#13;
       notary or prepare the agreement through E-Conveyancing&#13;
&#13;
       The sale agreement can be prepared by the seller or the buyer, no&#13;
       involvement of a lawyer or real estate agent is required by law. In general&#13;
       the seller present an extract from the Land Registry and extracts from the&#13;
       Title and Mortgage Registries demonstrating ownership and any&#13;
       registered encumbrances, but these are not formally required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The agreement must be in writing and contain at a minimum the&#13;
       following information (according to the Code of Real Estate 540/1995, as&#13;
       amended): name of the seller and buyer, the object of purchase&#13;
       (including real estate number), the purchase price or equivalent&#13;
       compensation and possible subsequent conditions. The agreement must                            120 (55 â&#130;¬ when&#13;

       The sale agreement shall be signed both by the seller and buyer, in the&#13;
       presence of the attesting notary. The attesting notary checks the ID of&#13;
       the seller and buyer and verifies the formal validity of the sales&#13;
       agreement. Failure to follow these requirements will result in the&#13;
       transaction being automatically null and void. Note that an attesting&#13;
       notary is required only when ownership (freehold title) of the real estate&#13;
       is assigned. When the right of tenancy (leasehold) or other right to&#13;
       possess the property is assigned, the presence of the attesting notary is&#13;
       not required. The attesting notary must inform National Land Survey of&#13;
       Finland of the transaction and the buyer must apply for the registration&#13;
       of its title at their offices (see Procedure 3).&#13;

      Mortgage Register enjoys public credibility and thus the validity of the&#13;
      registration of title and the information of the register can be trusted.&#13;
      The NLS office examines the preconditions for transfer of title and when&#13;
      those are met, registers the title in the name of the buyer. With the E-&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

doing business ranking, which is based on the distance&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

practice across the entire sample of 36 indicators for 10     extreme outliers in the distributions of the rescaled data&#13;
Doing Business topics (the labor market regulation            for most component indicators (very few economies&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;
score for the total tax rateâ&#128;&#148;and therefore on the&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Finland
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Finland.
            To allow for useful comparison, the profile also provides
            data for other selected economies (comparator economies) for
            each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the 13th edition in a
            series of annual reports measuring the regulations that
            enhance business activity and those that constrain it.
            Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business; for
            2015 Finland ranks 10. A high ease of doing business ranking
            means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the
            starting and operation of a local firm. Doing Business
            presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and
            the protection of property rights that can be compared
            across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over
            time. Doing Business sheds light on how easy or difficult it
            is for a local entrepreneur to open and run a small to
            medium-size business when complying with relevant
            regulations. It measures and tracks changes in regulations
            affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a business: starting
            a business, dealing with construction permits, getting
            electricity, registering property, getting credit,
            protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across
            borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency and labor
            market regulation. The data in this report are current as of
            June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes indicators, which
            cover the period from January to December 2014).
