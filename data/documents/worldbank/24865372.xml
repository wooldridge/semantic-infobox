I. Why Financial Inclusion as a Development Objective?&#13;
The relevance of implementing a nation-wide program to promote financial inclusion has become&#13;
indisputable. Numerous impact studies have shown the benefits of financial inclusion and helped to&#13;
better understand its limits. Public authorities are paying more attention to the risks linked with&#13;
financial exclusion and its negative impact on economic, social and political stability. In effect, the&#13;
G20 has recognized financial inclusion as one of the global development pillars, the World Bank has&#13;
established an objective of universal access to financial services by 2020, and the General Secretary&#13;
of the United Nations appointed Queen MÃ¡xima of the Netherlands as its Special Advocate for&#13;
financial inclusion. Since 2011, more than 60 countries have initiated reforms to improve financial&#13;
inclusion.&#13;
&#13;
Financial inclusion has several positive effects on an economy. First of all, it improves the&#13;
effectiveness of financial intermediation by increasing the number of actors in the financial system,&#13;
together with the volume and value of transactions. At the macroeconomic level, a developed&#13;
financial system, measured by its level of financial intermediation, has a positive correlation with&#13;
growth, employment, poverty and, through this, a reduction in inequality.5 Gross Domestic Product&#13;
(GDP) growth is also positively correlated with access to credit and the opening of bank branches. As&#13;
a result, countries with advanced levels of financial development have seen the proportion of those&#13;
living in poverty decrease more rapidly and their Gini6 coefficient improve (see Figure 1).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
In addition, partly due to risk diversification (e.g. wide and varied deposit base, portfolio of small and&#13;
lowly volatile loans), financial inclusion contributes directly to financial stability.7 It also positively&#13;
impacts stability as it leads to the formalization of businesses, which in turn improves the&#13;
effectiveness of monetary policy and reduces the use of informal or unregulated financial services,&#13;
themselves a source of instability (e.g. through fraud and over-indebtedness). In addition, financial&#13;
inclusion promotes the rise of new economic models, which pushes the entire financial system to&#13;
professionalize. Financial stability is of particular concern to central banks, particularly since the 2008&#13;
financial crisis.&#13;
&#13;
5 There is a two-way causal relationship between the financial system development and economic growth. According to&#13;
economic theory, financial system development impact growth through increased capital accumulation and improved&#13;
productivity, two key elements of GDP growth. In addition, access to savings promotes investment. The resulting economic&#13;
growth stimulates employment and reduces poverty. See Where is the Cheese? Synthesizing a Giant Literature on the&#13;
Causes and Consequences of Financial Sector Development, Pasali, World Bank, 2013.&#13;

&#13;
ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 100 (perfect inequality).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At the microeconomic level, access to financial services has a positive effect on employment and on&#13;
household consumption, and stimulates the local economy. In Morocco, access to credit led to a&#13;
52% increase in the number of days worked outside of the household and a 10% increase in the in-&#13;
kind savings and consumption levels.8 Access to savings allows people with low, and frequently&#13;
irregular, incomes to better manage emergencies and spikes in spending, and therefore maintain a&#13;
more stable level of consumption over time. Additionally, access to finance is an essential growth&#13;
driver for very small, small, and medium-sized enterprises (VSSMEs), which is of particular&#13;
importance since the most dynamic small and medium-sized businesses have been demonstrated to&#13;
create the largest number of jobs in an economy.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, financial inclusion allows for a cost-effective implementation of social policies, such as&#13;
government-to-person payments. In Brazil, the administration costs of the Bolsa FamÃ­lia (family&#13;
allowances) program have fallen by more than 80% following the introduction of prepaid cards and&#13;
the payment of several allowances at once.9&#13;
&#13;
In sum, the empirical evidence shows that financial inclusion, even if it does not eradicate poverty&#13;
on its own, helps to achieve the goal of social and economic inclusion, in conjunction with other&#13;
public policies. At household level, this is achieved by expanding income-generating opportunities&#13;
and by improving risk management. For businesses and the wider economy, it is through more&#13;
efficient capital mobilization for investment and growth (see Table 2). This is especially important in a&#13;
country like Tunisia, which has an unemployment rate above 15% (42% among young people)10 and a&#13;
large number of informal businesses.&#13;

&#13;
Capturing the benefits of financial inclusion is in line with the Coordinated Vision for the&#13;
Development of Microfinance, published by the Tunisian Finance Ministry in 2011 and aimed at&#13;
developing a â&#128;&#156;socially responsible and durable microfinance sector that, by promoting access for as&#13;
many people as possible to quality financial services, would contribute to the fight against financial&#13;
exclusion, to harmonious regional development, and to the strengthening of the national economic&#13;
structure.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Since November 2013, the Finance Ministry and the microfinance supervisory authority (ACM or&#13;
AutoritÃ© de ContrÃ´le de la Microfinance)11 have been members of the Alliance for Financial&#13;
Inclusion (AFI), 12 an international network of policy-makers, central banks, supervisory and&#13;

Tunisia stemming from both private individuals (2.5 to 3.5 million)                    interested in microsavings&#13;
and businesses (245,000 to 425,000 micro and very small&#13;
enterprises). These figures are approximate.                                         Tunisians seek access to a product&#13;
                                                                                    that would allow them to put aside&#13;
Numerous studies have shown that all socio-professional                             small sums each day or each week.&#13;
categories make use of financial services. Low-income                                   Such a product is currently&#13;
populations, however, need them even more than other groups,                               unavailable in Tunisia.&#13;
owing to the irregularity of their incomes. Despite limited              Source: World Bank/CAWTAR, 2015.&#13;
resources, low-income populations have very active financial&#13;
lives: they save, borrow, manage different cash in-flows and outflows and lend moneyâ&#128;&#148;often all at&#13;
the same time. They fall back on social solidarity mechanisms in case of problems. The financial&#13;
services they use, however, are not always reliable and could be insufficient, risky and/or expensive&#13;
(e.g. family, friends, money-lenders, in-kind or under the mattress savings). This underscores the&#13;
importance of developing formal financial services that respond to their needs.&#13;
&#13;
In Tunisia, although the supply of inclusive financial services is more advanced than in other&#13;
countries in the regionâ&#128;&#148;not least thanks to the postal networkâ&#128;&#148;it remains far from comprehensive.&#13;
The World Bank/CAWTAR study identified a level of financial inclusion of just 36% of the adult&#13;
population (see Box 1 below). Recent efforts by the government and private sector have focused on&#13;
                                                              DRAFT&#13;

certain microcredit products (see section III), and have not responded to the demand for savings&#13;
services,14 insurance, and payment services. Various studies have highlighted a demand falling&#13;
between 950,000 and 1.4 million individuals for microcredit, but an even larger demand of 2.5 to&#13;
3.5 million individuals for a wider range of microfinance services, equivalent to 30% to 40% of the&#13;
adult population (see Table 3).15&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, many enterprises have financing needs that are far from being met by existing supply. It is&#13;
estimated that 245,000 to 425,000 micro and very small enterprises require a specific range of&#13;
financial services, equivalent to 37% to 65% of those registered in the national business registry&#13;
(RNE). 16 The 2014 IFC study estimated that approximately 15,000 small and medium-sized&#13;
enterprises (SMEs) should be added to this figure17. It found that only 15% of very small, small, or&#13;
medium-sized enterprises (VSSMEs) have taken out bank loans whereas 58% have expressed the&#13;
need for financing in order to make investments or for working capital. This gap is significant enough&#13;
to indicate a lack of supply, even if not all of this demand was credit-worthy. It may be explained by a&#13;

include: IBM Belgium 2009; Finance Ministry, 2011; Mercy Corps, 2012; CoopÃ©ration Luxembourgeoise-ADA-EIB, 2013 and&#13;

14 The demand for savings services is generally higher than for credit. At the global level, including the Arab world,&#13;
&#13;
specialized microfinance institutions serve between 4 and 10 times more savers than borrowers.&#13;
15 For a comparison, the number of adults living on less than 4 TND per day (or 1,500 TND per year) is estimated at around&#13;
&#13;
2.7 million adults (Source: Study on Financial Inclusion in Tunisia, MicroMED, February 2014).&#13;

   Formal enterprises are those that have a tax identification number and are registered with the RNE. There were 654,000&#13;
formal enterprises in 2013. By conservative estimates, 245,000 is the number of enterprises that reported their sales.&#13;
Informal enterprises are included in the demand for individual persons since lending to an informal enterprise, in practice,&#13;
means lending to an individual.&#13;
17&#13;
   The frontier between micro, very small, small, and medium-sized enterprises remains vague given the lack of a national&#13;
definition.&#13;

&#13;
However, quantifying this demand was based on secondary sources and gives rise to the possibility of&#13;
significant margins of error, since the data is 5 or even 10 years old. Tunisia currently lacks the data&#13;
required to properly understand the market demand for financial services and hence create&#13;
appropriate financial inclusion policies and conducive legislative frameworks. Market players,&#13;
including financial service providers, also lack this data, which could be used to refine their growth&#13;
strategies and avoid focusing on narrow market segments.&#13;
&#13;
Detailed studies analyzing financial behavior and use of financial services have never been carried&#13;
                                                                    DRAFT&#13;

out in Tunisia. This prevents a solid understanding of the varied financial needs of key market&#13;
segments, including employees, temporary workers, unemployed people, students, farmers, micro-&#13;
entrepreneurs, and registered businesses. For example, it is not known why, according to Findex&#13;
2014 data, less than 10% of adults save in a formal account while more than 27% indicate having&#13;
access to a formal financial account (bank or postal account). Qualitative studies suggest that&#13;
Tunisians do not plan their expenses and can quickly find themselves in financial difficulty in cases of&#13;
unexpected events or illness. This suggests the need for savings and insurance services, as well as the&#13;
necessity to encourage a better savings culture over the long term.&#13;
&#13;
Islamic financial services appear to be a niche market in Tunisia. According to a study by the&#13;
European Union,19 only 1.4% of the people interviewed had voluntarily excluded themselves from&#13;
microcredit for religious reasons. Findex indicators corroborate this point, with only 5% of people&#13;
interviewed stating they do not have an account for religious reasons.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of geographic distribution, the target population is divided into two regions: the interior&#13;
region for low-income households, and the coastal regionâ&#128;&#148;where the majority of economic&#13;
activity is concentratedâ&#128;&#148;for enterprises. The distribution of the financial services market broadly&#13;
follows this geographic division, with banks mainly concentrated in coastal areas, while the post&#13;
office and microcredit associations, though spread throughout the country, particularly well-&#13;
developed in the interior.&#13;

                               Box 1. Access to and Use of Financial Services in Tunisia&#13;
&#13;
In 2015 the World Bank and the Center of Arab Women for Training and Research (CAWTAR) launched a&#13;
market study on digital finance in Tunisia. This study was based on a survey of 1,200 Tunisians over 15-year&#13;
old in 17 governorates across the country, and allowed data to be gathered on the use of traditional non-&#13;
mobile financial services as well. It concluded that 64% of the Tunisian population over the age of 15 either&#13;
does not have access or has very limited access to formal financial services (segments 1 and 2 below).&#13;
The rate of financial inclusion thus stands at 36%.&#13;

                                        Box 2. Financial Inclusion of SMEs&#13;
&#13;
Financial inclusion efforts are often targeted to low-income households and micro-enterprisesâ&#128;&#148;the focus of&#13;
this documentâ&#128;&#148;however also concerns very small, small, and medium-size enterprises (VSSMEs). This second&#13;
segment was the subject of a market study led by the IFC in 2014, which comprised a survey of approximately&#13;
1,400 VSSMEs and interviews with 17 financial institutions. The primary conclusions of this study are&#13;
summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
The IFC study focused on formal enterprises having between 1 to 199 employees, or nearly 80,000 enterprises&#13;
in Tunisia, of which 15,000 are SMEs. Half of the commercial banks and nearly all leasing firms view these&#13;
VSSMEs as a priority segment. 71% of these VSSMEs are considered financially included and 80% of those that&#13;
applied for banking financing were successful in receiving it.&#13;
&#13;
However, access to finance for VSSMEs is far from simple: 29% of the VSSMEs examined had never attempted&#13;
to open a bank account; 37% reported needing financing although never entering into contact with a financial&#13;
institution; 78% used cash to pay their supplier and 91% to pay their employees. The gap between supply and&#13;
demand is explained by a combination of shortcomings and inadequacies at the level of VSSMEs (often&#13;
incomplete financial information), financial institutions (products and systems not entirely suitable to serve&#13;
this segment), and infrastructure (limited effectiveness of guarantee funds and public banks; underutilized&#13;
credit registry data; training and supervision of VSSMES not sufficiently effective).&#13;
&#13;
The study recommends several improvement areas for both financial institutions and authorities, and stresses&#13;
on three key principles: the need for a more organized national coordination, the development of the entire&#13;
range of financial services beyond credit (insurance, payment methodsâ&#128;&#148;salaries, suppliers, cash management&#13;
toolsâ&#128;&#148;debt collection, financial education, etc.), and recognition of the segmentâ&#128;&#153; diversity (by sector but also&#13;
by profitability profile for the financial institutionâ&#128;&#148;four strategic segments are identified in the study).&#13;

III. The Legislative and Regulatory Framework&#13;
Financial inclusion in Tunisia is regulated by a series of specific laws governing each type of actor.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Banks are regulated by law no. 2001-65, dated July 10, 2001 relating to credit establishments,&#13;
     which recognizes leasing and factoring as credit operations.20 It was amended and completed by&#13;
     law no. 2006-19 of May 2, 2006. Banks have the exclusive right on payment operations. Banking&#13;
     law is currently under review.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Leasing companies are regulated by law no. 94-89, dated July 26, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    The National Post Office (â&#128;&#156;the Post Officeâ&#128;&#157; or â&#128;&#156;Postâ&#128;&#157;) is a public industrial and commercial&#13;
     enterprise, created by decree no. 98-1305, dated June 15, 1998, which established its&#13;
     administrative and financial organization and operational model. This decree conferred it with,&#13;
     among others, the responsibility for managing postal savings and current accounts, which are&#13;
     regulated by law no. 90-97, dated November 1, 1990. The Post is the only non-bank institution&#13;
     authorized to collect savings, and to provide means of payment.21 It is not, however, authorized&#13;
     to grant credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20 Banks must adhere to the Code of Obligations and Contracts (COC). In the absence of a specific legislation, this text also&#13;
applies to Islamic financial products. Offshore banks are subject to law no. 2009-64 dated August 12, 2009 (financial&#13;
services for non-residents).&#13;
21 Postal current accounts have existed since 1918. The national savings bank was created in 1956.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are regulated by decree-law no. 2011-117, dated November 5,&#13;
     2011, amended by law no. 46 of July 24, 2014,22 and by five consecutive orders issued between&#13;
     2012 and 2014 (box 3 below provides a timeline and implementation details pertaining to the&#13;
     regulatory framework for microfinance). In this document, â&#128;&#156;MFIâ&#128;&#157; refers to associations and&#13;
     companies authorized in the context of the decree, together with associations created earlier&#13;
     and currently operating in the context of the compliance period.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Insurance companies are regulated by the Insurance Code created by law no. 92-24, dated&#13;
     March 9, 1992.&#13;
&#13;
At present, legislation places limits on the outsourcing of banking operations. Only some operations,&#13;
such as gathering customer data or currency exchange, can be outsourced under certain conditions&#13;
and with the prior agreement of the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT). The CBT circular dated January,&#13;
2011 sets out a framework for the development of mobile financial services, permitting SIM cards to&#13;
be linked to a bank account or to a prepaid card (see part on digital finance under Section IV).&#13;
&#13;
Supervision&#13;
Table 4 below presents an overview of how Tunisian financial institutions are supervised. In line with&#13;
the 2011 Concerted Vision, the ACM now supervises the microfinance sector. This is an interim&#13;
arrangement prior to a secondary stage where monitoring would be transferred, at least in part, to&#13;
the CBT. The ACMâ&#128;&#153;s general management has been in place since November 2012 and employs a&#13;
team of 9. Its board of directors is made up of 8 members who meet regularly.23&#13;

January 24, 2014, govern anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism&#13;
(CFT) efforts, and apply to all financial institutions, including MFIs.&#13;
&#13;
Consumer protection&#13;
Tunisia has a general framework for consumer rights and a Consumer Protection Association but no&#13;
specific law or organization related to financial services. For credit institutions, since 2006, the law&#13;
provides for a mediation service to resolve disputes between banks and their clients. This service is&#13;
free for the client, and the Banking Services Observatory (BSO), created by law no. 2006-26 of&#13;
May 15, 2006 to ensure the quality of banking services, issues an annual report on the subject.&#13;
Decree no. 2000-462 of February 21, 2000 established the methods of calculating the Annual&#13;
Percentage Rate (APR) and the average interest rate, as well as their method of publication, while the&#13;
BSO carries out publically-available studies of banking charges. For MFIs, article 8 of law no. 99-67&#13;
makes it compulsory to publish lending conditions in the branches. Publishing the APR is not&#13;
&#13;
22 Associations are also regulated by decree-law no. 2011-88 of September 24, 2011. The decree-law no. 2011-118 dated&#13;
November 5, 2011 outlines tax provisions for MFIs.&#13;
23 The ACMâ&#128;&#153;s General Director also presides its board, which comprises a high-level magistrate, an advisor to the national&#13;
&#13;
administrative court, a representative from the Ministry of Finance, a representative from the General Committee of&#13;
Insurance Providers, a representative of the National Committee of Accountants, a representative from the Central Bank,&#13;
and a member selected on the basis of his or her knowledge of the microfinance sector.&#13;
&#13;

mandatory, however this may change in light of the forthcoming order on fair treatment of clients.&#13;
Articles 34 and 36 of decree-law no. 2011-117 detail the relationship between MFIs and their clients&#13;
in terms of information about products, avoiding over-indebtedness, and handling client complaints.&#13;
A code of ethics is being written, in parallel with the creation of a professional association for MFIs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Box 3. History and Legislative Context Related to Microfinance Institutions&#13;
 1995: Enda, an association operational since 1990, first introduces microcredit in Tunisia. The legislation of&#13;
 the time did not provide a legal structure suited for non-bank financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
 1997: The Tunisian Solidarity Bank (BTS) is created.&#13;
&#13;
 1999: The first law on microcredit, law no. 99-67 dated July 15, created the status of Microcredit Association&#13;
 (AMC), and established the BTS as the national refinancing organization (at 0% interest provided 80% of the&#13;
 amount is repaid) and the National Guarantee Fund (NGF) as a risk-protection mechanism (covering 90% of&#13;
 bad debt from AMC and BTS clients). The order of August 27 defines the maximum microcredit amount&#13;
 (1,000 TND, which will progressively increase to reach 5,000 TND in 2009) and places a cap on interest rates&#13;
 (5% on a declining balance, to which commissions capped at 2.5% will later be added).&#13;
&#13;
 2005: Enda obtains special authorization from the Ministry of Finance to charge a rate that covers its costs,&#13;
 which de facto exempts it from the interest rate cap.&#13;
&#13;
 2010: An order dated September 29 frees the portion of the microcredit portfolio not refinanced by the BTS&#13;
 from the interest rate cap.&#13;
&#13;
 2011-2013: Decree-law no. 2011-117 of 2011 and the subsequent orders lay the foundation for a sound&#13;
 development of the sector by: authorizing the emergence of new actors and the restructuring of existing&#13;
 ones under the status of either associations or limited liabilities companies (LLCs); defining working&#13;
 standards; creating the Microfinance Supervisory Authority (ACM), which provides advice on licensing and&#13;
 oversees the sector; and authorizing MFIs to act as agents for insurance companies. This legal framework&#13;
                                                              DRAFT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 also established the maximum loan amount (5,000 TND for associations and 20,000 TND for LLCs) and&#13;
 confirmed an interest rate cap for loans refinanced through budgetary resources. Decree-law no. 2011-117&#13;
 gives associations a one-year deadline to comply with these new measures. In November 2012, the vast&#13;
 majority of AMCs were not yet in compliance and find themselves outside of the legal framework. This leads&#13;
 the BTS to suspend its financing, causing a considerable contraction of the microcredit market. The AMCs&#13;
 subsequently jointly defend their cause at the National Constituent Assembly, in addition to organizing&#13;
 protests in May 2013.&#13;
&#13;
 2014: Law no. 2014-46, issued in July, lowered the minimum capital required for AMCs (from 200,000 to&#13;
 50,000 TND), but not the minimum capital requirement for LLCs (3 M TND). For loans refinanced outside of&#13;
 budgetary resources, the law introduces a cap on interest rates, which remains to be defined by ministerial&#13;
 order. This cap could follow the method used in calculating the banking cap and be based on the average of&#13;
 the microcredit market, excluding loans refinanced through budgetary resources. Differentiation by product&#13;
 or customer segment is also being studied. The law postponed the deadline for compliance to December&#13;
 2016, potentially extendable by decree, which means ACMs will have had in total over 5 years to reorganize&#13;
 themselves. 24 An order dated November 17, 2014 established the external audit modalities for MFI&#13;
 accounts.&#13;
&#13;
 It is expected that the microfinance regulatory framework will be completed by forthcoming legislation&#13;
 covering accounting norms, loan loss provisioning policies, authorized micro-insurance products,&#13;
 governance, financial transparency, audit committees, contractual conditions between MFIs and their&#13;
 clients, and contributions to the ACM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24By following well-documented and often publically available international good practices, it is currently possible to set up&#13;
a microcredit institution and make it sustainable within 5 years. This supposes that the institution can cover its costs&#13;
(operations, risk, financing) with its income (interest, commissions).&#13;

&#13;
IV. The Current Supply of Financial Services&#13;
The Tunisian financial sector is dominated by banks, with         Tunisians frequently make use of&#13;
assets equal to approximately 100% of GDP.25 This figure               informal financial services&#13;
is somewhat lower than in other countries of the region&#13;
such as Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Morocco. More than ï&#130;· 16% of adults have borrowed from family&#13;
half of total bank credit is provided to firms in the           or friends in the last 12 months.&#13;
industrial, trade, and tourism sectors. The non-bank ï&#130;· Only 8% of adults have borrowed from a&#13;
financial sector is relatively small, with microfinance         formal financial institution.&#13;
accounting for only 0.2% of overall financial sector assets.    Source: Findex 2014.&#13;
Despite the size of the untapped market, for the majority&#13;
of services, it is clear that supply is not adapted to existing demand, as suggested by the frequent&#13;
use of informal financial services, both for savings and for credit.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Note: The total market is estimated as follows: 1) Savings: total = adult population or 8.4 million individuals; 2) Credit to individuals =&#13;
estimate of 950,000 for microcredit only (2014 study); 3) Credit to formal enterprises = all businesses in the national registry RNE (654,200&#13;
in 2013). Further studies are required to better quantify the numbers and relevant amounts, especially for credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Banks&#13;
The Tunisian banking market comprises 21 commercial banks and has seen an 8% growth since 2010,&#13;
reaching 1,449 branches and 1,857 ATMs as of December 31, 2013. Even if these figures put Tunisia&#13;
ahead of its peers in the Arab world in terms of coverage per inhabitant, the geographic distribution&#13;
of these branches remains uneven. There is a heavy concentration in larger cities and the most&#13;
productive regions (North-East and Center-East; the Greater Tunis area and the coastal region&#13;
comprise the majority of bank branches). Banks have not developed a range of services adapted to&#13;
low-income populations, micro-entrepreneurs, or small businesses. For example, fees for holding an&#13;
account can be in excess of 80 TND/year, and significant guarantees are required for credit.&#13;
&#13;
The number of fixed-term deposits (FTD) in banks saw an increase of 18% between 2010 and&#13;
September 2013. In the absence of a market study, it is difficult to know if this represents a cultural&#13;
change in attitudes towards savings or demonstrates a greater propensity to save during periods of&#13;
economic slowdown, or if it is simply a reaction to a temporary improvement in the conditions&#13;
offered by banks seeking liquidity.&#13;

Banks have low portfolio quality (around 15% of loans in arrears) and lend primarily to:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·      Individuals, particularly salaried workers who can legally borrow up to 40% of their income (1.3&#13;
       million borrowers for 16 billion TND outstanding in 2013 according to the CBT, with an increase&#13;
       of 17% per year since 2010 but a stable average loan size of around 13,000 TND per borrower&#13;
       and a borrowing period of 3 years; 85% of the outstanding loans are used for housing and/or&#13;
       home improvement).&#13;
ï&#130;·      Formal businesses (338,000 financed businesses in 2013, i.e. around 50% of formal Tunisian&#13;
       businesses, with an outstanding total of 41 billion TND) and in particular medium-sized and large&#13;
       businesses (less than 1,500 businesses account for nearly 70% of total outstanding loans to&#13;
       companies; 50% of the outstanding amount is for large groups).&#13;
&#13;
The majority of financial institutions consider the VSSME market risky and opaque, but inevitable&#13;
given its importance in the Tunisian economy. VSSMEs already represent a significant part of leasing&#13;
companiesâ&#128;&#153; portfolios. However, apart from the two banks specialized in VSSME financing (see Box&#13;
4), no Tunisian financial institution has a strategy dedicated to this market (IFC, 2014).&#13;

Besides refinancing AMCs, the BTS directly provides credit for enterprise creation or expansion, with&#13;
amounts going up to 150,000 TND for university graduates (average loan size of 10,000 TNS and&#13;
arrears above 30% in 2014). Its direct outreach has been increasing over the past few years (112 000&#13;
active clients and 620 M TND of outstanding portfolio in 2014 according to the BTS, as compared to&#13;
~47,000 and 422 M TND in 2010 according to the Concerted Vision).&#13;

Investment Bank for Small and Medium Enterprises (BFPME)&#13;
Created in 2005, the BFPME is focused on financing existing and new SMEs, by granting credit under&#13;
favorable conditions (100,000 to 5 million TND, over 2 to 12 years, with a 7% rate and a public&#13;
guarantee). In 2013, it adopted a co-financing rule with other local banks. Its impact remains very&#13;
limited (2,000 projects financed between 2005 and 2012) and the quality of its portfolio is very weak&#13;
(over 30% of loans in arrears).&#13;
&#13;
National Agricultural Bank (NAB)&#13;
The NAB is a State bank created in 1959 to respond to agricultural financing needs, and now one of&#13;
the most important universal banks in Tunisia. It finances around 20% of the food and agriculture&#13;
industry, but does not reach all farmers, notably due to its bureaucratic procedures. In addition, the&#13;
majority of the 110,000 smallholders to whom it has granted credit are in arrears. As a result, the&#13;
bank no longer serves this sector and focuses on providing loans over 4,000 TND.26&#13;
&#13;
Islamic Banks&#13;
The Tunisian financial system currently includes two universal banks offering products compliant&#13;
with the principles of Islamic finance. Al Baraka was created in 1985 (12 branches, subsidiary of the&#13;
Bahraini banking group) and Zitouna in 2009 (~50 branches). The Tunisian State is a minority&#13;
shareholder in the former and a majority shareholder in the latter. Little information is available on&#13;
the number and profile of their clients.&#13;

The Tunisian Post Office&#13;
With 1,051 branches (offices and mobile branches) in 2014, the postal network is almost as extensive&#13;
as that of the entire banking sector, but far more evenly spread across Tunisia. This network makes&#13;
it a key player when it comes to financial inclusion. The Tunisian Post offers a wide range of&#13;
financial services (deposits, transfers, insurance, payment means) with the exception of credit. Its&#13;
fees and rates are deemed reasonable for the low-income population and it offers favorable&#13;
conditions, particularly for current and savings accounts where the average balance is under&#13;
1,000 TND (e.g. no account fees, free operations, availability of savings, flexibility of payments and&#13;
withdrawals). This helps explain the Postâ&#128;&#153;s 45% market share in terms of accounts number. As with&#13;
the banks, the total number of postal accounts and their amount have grown steadily in recent years.&#13;

However, with only 178 ATMs, a quarter of its branches not connected to a central server, relatively&#13;
limited opening hours, and minimum payment amounts, the Post does not yet offer easy-to-use&#13;
micro-savings solutions (regular withdrawals and deposits of very small amounts) or payment means.&#13;
Over 50% of postal accounts are inactive (no movement for 2 years).&#13;
&#13;
Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)&#13;
The regulatory framework authorizes MFIs to offer microcredit services to finance income-&#13;
generating activities and improvements to living conditions (see Table 7 for loan conditions),&#13;
together with training or support services. MFIs can also enter into micro-insurance contracts in the&#13;
name and on behalf of insurance companies. The sale of micro-insurance products is however&#13;
subject to a framework agreement between the professional insurance and microfinance&#13;
associations.27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27Since the professional association for MFIs has not yet been officially constituted, MFIs cannot yet offer micro-insurance&#13;
products. In the event of death or invalidity, Enda offers its clients a premium that covers the remainder of the loan, as well&#13;
as a 500 TND compensation for the families.&#13;

&#13;
ï&#130;·    First created in 1999, AMCs cover the entire country, and particularly inner regions, but they&#13;
     remain very modest in size (850 clients on average in 2010) as compared to MFIs within the&#13;
     region and globally (2013 median of over 21,000 clients for MFIs in the Arab world, and 13,500 in&#13;
     the world).28 As of 2011, 289 AMCs were registered in Tunisia, the majority created between&#13;
     2004 and 2007.29 Their 3-month Non-Performing Loans (NPL) was estimated at 27% in December&#13;
     2010, according to the Concerted Vision. However, despite strong support from the State and&#13;
     local authorities, 30 AMCs were restricted by a stringent interest rate cap. 31 No longer in&#13;
     compliance with the new legal framework at the beginning of 2013, AMCs lost their access to BTS&#13;
     financing and had to limit or cease their lending operations. Their number of active borrowers is&#13;
     estimated to have fallen from 237,000 in 2010 to around 150,000. This situation remained until&#13;
     August 2014, when the deadline to achieve compliance was extended. Since then, around 147&#13;
     AMCs have renewed their activities and the Ministry of Employment has allocated one million&#13;
     TND to support their restructuring. The Kairouan Association for Integrated Development (AKDI)&#13;
     has received its certificate of compliance with decree-law no. 2011-117, and the Association to&#13;
     Support Self-Development (ASAD) received the authorization to transfer its microfinance&#13;
     activities to a subsidiary. The AMCs in the Bizerte and Siliana regions have taken steps to merge&#13;
     in their respective governorates.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    With 78 branches and in operation since 1995, Enda covers practically all regions in Tunisia, even&#13;
                                                              DRAFT&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     if its network is less dense than that of all AMCs taken together. Thanks to the special&#13;
     authorization that has allowed it to cover its operating costs with higher interest rates (yet still in&#13;
     line with the international average), and thanks also to its strong organization and good&#13;
     management practices, Enda has witnessed faster growth (on average twice that of AMCs) and&#13;
     better repayment rates (less than 2% in arrears). Enda has now reached a size making it a crucial&#13;
     player in the microcredit market (246,788 borrowers and over 240 million TND of assets as of&#13;
     December 2014). Its market share has increased from 30% to near 50% in the wake of the&#13;
     reduction in AMCsâ&#128;&#153; services. Enda has already obtained a certificate of compliance with decree-&#13;
     law no. 2011-117 and has begun the necessary steps to transfer its microfinance activities to a&#13;
     subsidiary company.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    In the framework of decree-law no. 2011-117, authorizations have been granted to newly-&#13;
     created companies, Taysir, Microcred Tunisia, Advans Tunisia, and CFE (Entrepreneur Financial&#13;
     Center). Taysir and Microcred disbursed their first loans in June and November 2014,&#13;
     respectively. Taysirâ&#128;&#153;s majority shareholders are Tunisians and it counts the French NGO Adie&#13;
     International as a shareholder and operator. It has taken the decision not rely on cashiers in its&#13;
     branches and to make all disbursements and reimbursements in partnership with the Tunisian&#13;
     Post, using prepaid e-Dinar cards and the MobiFlouss service offered jointly with the mobile&#13;

30 Notably: activity-related subsidies provided by the State through the BTS, equivalent to 3% of the interest rate paid by&#13;
&#13;
the client according to the Concerted Vision; several employees supported by the State through apprenticeship programs;&#13;
and the provision of equipment and premises through local authorities.&#13;
31 Annual rate of 5% on a declining balance and 2.5% of commissions, equivalent to an APR below 10% for loans with a&#13;
&#13;
12-month term. For a comparison, according to the 2013 MixMarket figures, the average MFI portfolio yield, which reflects&#13;
the APR, was over 30% in the region, and over 26% globally for MFIs able to cover their operating costs.&#13;

     network operator Ooredoo.32 Microcred Holding has a majority stake in and is the operator of&#13;
     Microcred Tunisia. Advans Group holds a majority stake in Advans Tunisia, which disbursed its&#13;
     first loans in March 2015. CFE, created by Desjardins International Development (DID) and&#13;
     Tuninvest, disbursed its first loans in July 2015.&#13;
&#13;
Other financial operators&#13;
Financial service providers in Tunisia also include 10 leasing companies, 3 factoring companies, and&#13;
several dozen venture capital firms. National funds also grant social loans of up to 15,000 TND for&#13;
those they insure (the National Social Security Fundâ&#128;&#148;CNSS, and the National Pension and Social&#13;
Security Fundâ&#128;&#148;CNRPS).33 Meanwhile, many micro-entrepreneurs and VSEs have recourse to credit&#13;
from suppliers, and public companies that distribute water, electricity and gas (SONEDE and STEG)&#13;
extend payment terms that can be compared to small loans.&#13;
&#13;
Insurance companies&#13;
Private insurance services are not widespread in Tunisia, in part because of a lack of insurance&#13;
culture in the country across all socio-professional categories. The premiums written by all the 19&#13;
insurance companies operating in Tunisia represent less than 2% of GDP (the average insurance&#13;
premium per inhabitant was around 120 TND in 2012). Even with the increasing volume of insurance&#13;
policies provided by the Post, this figure remains extremely low in comparison with the population.&#13;
Car insurance, which is obligatory, is most prevalent (46% of written premiums), followed by life&#13;
insurance (16% of written premiums). The Ministry of Social Affairs and the CNSS provide minimal&#13;
social coverage but not to the entire population. A mobile network operator and an insurance&#13;
company are about to launch a micro-health insurance product aimed at students, with monthly&#13;
online payment of the premium.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
According to the World Bank, the international person-to-person transfer of money into Tunisia,&#13;
which has an expatriate population of over 1 million, amounted to 3.7 billion TND in 2012 (5.3% of&#13;
GDP in 2009). Western Union (1,600 points of service) and Money Gram (500 points of service) are&#13;
primary providers. The Post processes the majority of domestic money transfers, which in 2012&#13;
totaled 785 million TND in 3.3 million transactions. Social transfers represent between 15% and 20%&#13;
of GDP, including subsidies for more than 120,000 disadvantaged families. The majority of these&#13;
transfers are conducted through the Post.&#13;
&#13;
Digital finance&#13;
The regulatory framework for digital finance in Tunisia is bank-led, and falls under the supervision of&#13;
the CBT. Partnerships between banks and non-banking institutions may be authorized, notably in&#13;
order to facilitate the opening of electronic wallets and the implementation of networks to purchase&#13;
or sell electronic money. In practical terms, implementation of these partnerships remains difficult.&#13;
To date, only one has emerged (BIAT/Via Mobile for the m-Dinar service) and has seen little uptake.&#13;
The four services currently on the market (the three postal servicesâ&#128;&#148;MobiFlouss, MobiDinar, and&#13;
Mobimoneyâ&#128;&#148;and the m-Dinar service) offer limited services and lack interoperability. There are,&#13;
however, several projects underway led by either mobile network operators, the Post, or the&#13;
government, which could change the digital finance landscape in Tunisia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
32 Customers receive an Ooredoo SIM card, and must acquire an e-Dinar card from the Tunisian Post, which will allow them&#13;
to withdraw the loan amount from a postal ATM. Repayment is made through the e-Dinar card, either at a postal branch or&#13;
through a Mobiflouss transfer.&#13;
33 Due to its financial situation, the CNRPS only grants two types of loans: personal loans (to cover urgent social needs) and&#13;
&#13;
university loans.&#13;

V. Market Infrastructure&#13;
Market infrastructure in Tunisia has improved since 2011, but remains under-developed, although&#13;
                                                                     DRAFT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
it is key to harnessing the healthy growth of the financial sector and to developing the market when&#13;
needed.&#13;
&#13;
Credit Bureau&#13;
Created in 1977, the CBT credit registry provides positive and negative information on loans to&#13;
registered businesses and individuals granted by banks and leasing companies.34 It includes 30% of&#13;
adults in Tunisia35 although it does not comprise all financial products (e.g. suppliersâ&#128;&#153; loans) or client&#13;
history. It is not yet possible to use the registry data to conduct analysis (e.g. market segmentation by&#13;
enterprise size). The CBT and the ACM are currently in discussion to develop a credit registry for&#13;
MFIs, linked to the existing registry. This platform should be operational by the end of 2015.&#13;
&#13;
National Guarantee Fund (NGF)&#13;
The NGF is funded by 1% of the amount of each loan provided by AMCs. In theory, this fund should&#13;
cover up to 90% of loan in arrears. It has never been used for several reasons, in particular due to the&#13;
legal procedures required, which are too costly as compared to the loan amount.&#13;
&#13;
Professional associations&#13;
The Tunisian financial sector includes several professional associations.&#13;
    ï&#130;· APTBEF is the professional association for banks and financial institutions (24 universal and&#13;
        investment banks, 9 leasing companies, and 2 factoring companies).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
34 Information is said to be positive when it involves outstanding debt and negative when it involves payment problems&#13;
(e.g. late loans, unpaid checks). The credit registry allows regulated financial institutions to measure the level and quality of&#13;
a potential clientâ&#128;&#153;s debt before financing him or her, which prevents both risky loans and clientsâ&#128;&#153; over-indebtedness.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;·    For MFIs, decree-law no. 2011-117 (article 54) makes membership in a professional&#13;
            association compulsory. The scope of such association is limited to representing the sector&#13;
            and ensuring it operates ethically. The professional association is in the process of being&#13;
            created and must be approved by the Ministry of Finance following consultation with the&#13;
            ACM.&#13;
       ï&#130;·    The Tunisian Federation of Insurance companies (FTUSA) represents all insurance companies.&#13;
&#13;
The Financial Inclusion Observatory&#13;
In line with the 2011 Concerted Vision, a scoping mission for the creation of an observatory took&#13;
place in December 2012. It confirmed the need to improve the quality of available information&#13;
related to financial inclusion, both from the supply and demand sides, as well as the coordination of&#13;
data gathering. Initially housing the Observatory within the ACM was considered appropriate. The&#13;
creation of the Observatory is pending the publication of a relevant ministerial decree.&#13;
&#13;
Training, audit, advisory, and support services&#13;
Although these services are available on the Tunisian market, including from international firms,&#13;
none are offered specifically in relation to microfinance. There is, however, a significant need for&#13;
financial education (for clients), advice and technical support (for associations), and training (for&#13;
human resources in financial institutions).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VI. Key Financial Inclusion Challenges&#13;
The opportunities for financial inclusion in Tunisia are significant. There remains, however, a&#13;
number of structural and short-term challenges to overcome in order to offer financial services to&#13;
the largest number of individuals and businesses, and through this channel, contribute to bringing&#13;
                                                                  DRAFT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
growth and dynamism to the Tunisian economy. While work has been initiated in a number of&#13;
important areas, particularly those dealing with market infrastructure, other significant projects have&#13;
yet to be initiated.&#13;
&#13;
1. The designation of a champion&#13;
&#13;
A financial inclusion strategy requires a strong commitment on behalf of at least one public&#13;
stakeholder. The Ministry of Finance has to date played this role, and the creation of the ACM is an&#13;
important step forward to continue advancing financial inclusion in Tunisia. In more than 70% of&#13;
cases around the world, however, financial inclusion strategies are led by central banks,36 which have&#13;
the mandate and the technical skills to deal with key elements of supporting financial inclusion,&#13;
including the regulation of financial activity in all of its aspects, the management of financial&#13;
infrastructure systems, and the supervision of financial institutions. These areas are beyond the&#13;
current mandate of the ACM. It is therefore necessary to identify the future champion of financial&#13;
inclusion in Tunisia, which must possess the ability to bring together a wide diversity of public and&#13;
private institutions and allow the development of a varied range of financial services, beyond&#13;
microcredit. In December 2013, aware of the need to pursue current reforms and develop a financial&#13;
inclusion strategy over the long term, the Tunisian authorities and donor agencies discussed the idea&#13;
of a national coordination committee. However, this has not yet been implemented.&#13;
&#13;
2. A better understanding of client needs&#13;
&#13;
Tunisia is critically short of up-to-date information on demand, supply, and behavior related to&#13;
financial services. Current segmentation is insufficient and lacks precision. A representative market&#13;

&#13;
study would be particularly useful for putting in place appropriate public policies, developing&#13;
adapted financial services, and for modifying the culture around financial services.37 International&#13;
donors have offered financing such a study and assisting the government in the coordination work of&#13;
the various stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
3. A better vision of the role of various actors&#13;
&#13;
A restructuring of the microcredit sector is underway, with new operators emerging and established&#13;
operators undergoing change, but the future remains unclear, particularly because of the confusion&#13;
generated by the successive legislative changes since 2011, which encourage the consolidation of&#13;
the sector on the one hand, and the status quo on the other.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Legal ambiguities concerning unions, mergers, and setting up subsidiaries of associations have&#13;
     not been resolved (e.g. the impossibility for a parent association to continue its credit activities,&#13;
     which prevents it from gradually transferring its portfolio; the complexity and practical&#13;
     difficulties of implementing unions of associations, notably because of a refinancing problem of&#13;
     tax and social arrears).&#13;
ï&#130;·    The future of AMCs is uncertain, given that the majority of them do not have the means or even&#13;
     the will to update their operational systems (IT, governance and internal controls).&#13;
ï&#130;·    Enda and the new entrants seem to be on the right path to increase microcredit penetration in&#13;
     Tunisia. However, the reworking of the law in 2014 opened the door to other changes,&#13;
     particularly regarding the interest rate cap. Such cap could jeopardize MFIs sustainability if its&#13;
     calculation method was not suitable.&#13;
&#13;
In this context, the role of the BTS is yet to be determined. Since 2011, several strategic options&#13;
have been discussed but no decision has been taken. The final choice is particularly sensitive, in light&#13;
                                                              DRAFT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of the BTS weight (735 million TND of assets in 2012), its traditional role as key supporter for AMCs,&#13;
and the challenges of reforming a public institution.&#13;
&#13;
The Post already plays a very important role in financial inclusion. It could however do more by&#13;
developing savings services that are better adapted to demand. To achieve this, it must choose the&#13;
strategy to reach its full potential and implement the significant organizational reforms that this&#13;
would require. Further analysis on the regulatory and supervisory framework underpinning the Post&#13;
would be a first step towards broader organizational reforms.&#13;
&#13;
Mobile phone payments and digital financial services represent unique opportunities for swiftly&#13;
expanding access to financial services, but their development requires a more enabling legislation&#13;
and infrastructure (e.g. legislation facilitating the development of alternative distribution channels,&#13;
national switching system for interbank payments).&#13;
&#13;
Different institutions (e.g. donors, AFI) could support Tunisiaâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to develop a genuine strategy&#13;
for financial inclusion, detailing the long-term vision of the financial landscape and clarifying the roles&#13;
of each type of actor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
37Additional studies would allow, for example, better understanding the financial needs of individuals, particularly the low-&#13;
income, and enterprises, particularly VSSMEs. What perception do they have of formal financial services and why do only&#13;
5% of adults save in a formal way while 25% save informally? What use do they make of financial services, both formal and&#13;
informal? Why do 53% of businesses appear to have a loan in the credit registry, while access to finance seems to be a&#13;
major impediment to the growth of Tunisian businesses?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
4. Access to liquidity&#13;
&#13;
Until 2011, AMCs were mainly financed by the State through the BTS, while Enda benefited from&#13;
local and foreign funding. The situation is expected to come under strain, however, given the lack of&#13;
liquidity troubling the Tunisian financial sector on the one hand, and the entry into the market of&#13;
new companies seeking funding on the other. If the lack of liquidity in the Tunisian banking sector&#13;
was to continue, it would impact the refinancing of MFIs and force them to refinance themselves in&#13;
foreign currency, at a significantly higher cost than local funding. Alternative solutions should then be&#13;
considered, such as revisiting the role of the BTS, the creation of a new dedicated refinancing&#13;
institution (commonly called Apex) and/or temporary and value-added mechanisms to support&#13;
liquidity (e.g. credit lines, partial credit guarantee programs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
Tunisia stands at a crossroad in terms of financial inclusion, with on the one hand a supply that&#13;
covers the most basic needs for savings and credit, but on the other a significant unmet or under-&#13;
served demand. Opportunities to improve financial inclusion are many. Some have already been set&#13;
in motion with the support of international donors, including the African Development Bank (AfDB),&#13;
the European Investment Bank (EIB), the World Bank Group/IFC, the French Development Agency&#13;
(AFD)/Proparco Group, German development aid (KfW and GIZ), and the European Union. By building&#13;
on financial inclusion as a key development pillar, beyond the limited scope of microcredit as it is&#13;
currently defined, Tunisia would be in a position to both stimulate economic growth and improve the&#13;
living conditions of its most disadvantaged citizens.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This technical note provides a snapshot
            of financial inclusion trends and challenges in Tunisia. It
            follows the recent expiration of the Coordinated Vision for
            the Development of Microfinance in Tunisia 2011-2014, a
            national strategy published in 2011. Financial inclusion
            refers to a state where all the citizens and businesses have
            access to financial services corresponding to their needs.
            This document focuses on low-income populations and
            micro-enterprises and is a critical enabler of economic
            growth in Tunisia through spurring household economic
            activity, reducing household vulnerabilities, generating
            employment, and contributing to financial stability.
