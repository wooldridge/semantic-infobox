to and form an integral part of all arrangements entered into between the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development ("IBRD") and the International Development Association&#13;

to as the "Donors") that provide grants (referred to as the "Contributions") to be administered by&#13;
the Bank for the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for the Global Program on Fisheries (PROFISH) (the&#13;
"Project").&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
The Bank will be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in&#13;
this Arrangement and will not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donor,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary&#13;
or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Arrangement will be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the IBRD and IDA under their Articles of&#13;
Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
2.     Commingling, Exchange and Investment of the Contributions&#13;
2.1.   The Contribution funds will be accounted for as a single trust fund and will be kept&#13;

PROFISH TFs work program activities and (ii) any DGF grant recipient or sub-grant recipient is&#13;
empowered, within the agreed budget and work program for that specific DGF grant or sub-grant&#13;
to modify the relevant work program activities, subject to prior agreement with the Focal Point.&#13;
The PSC is provided with ample justification for any such modifications in the work program.&#13;
4.6.   "Major changes" are considered at meetings of the PSC, or by email or other&#13;
correspondence using a 'no objections' procedure as appropriate, prior to Focal Point or DGF&#13;
grant implementation. "Major changes" are changes that in the opinion of the Chair constitute a&#13;
major change to the approved PROFISH work program and financial plan meriting PSC approval,&#13;
and may include, for example, the addition or elimination of a target country for the purposes of a&#13;
sector note, the addition of new activities to the work program, the elimination of existing&#13;
activities from the work program, or changes in the costs of approved activities that necessitate&#13;
adjustments exceeding 10% of the budget.&#13;
4.7.   PSC members are advised by the Focal Point in a timely manner of any changes or&#13;
modifications made to the annual PROFISH work program.&#13;
4.8.   The work program and its implementation will conform to the terms of agreement of&#13;
PROFISH TFs and DGF grants.&#13;
5.     FOCAL POINT&#13;
5.1.   The Focal Point is housed in the World Bank and acts as the secretariat for the PSC and&#13;
PROFISH. The Focal Point is led by a Task Team Leader, who reports to the Agriculture Sector&#13;
Manager, and is further staffed by World Bank staff and seconded staff meeting World Bank&#13;
secondment requirements, all of whom report to the Task Team Leader with respect to PROFISH&#13;
activities.&#13;
5.2.   Any proposals made to the PSC are directed through the Focal Point prior to&#13;
consideration by the PSC. The Focal Point has responsibility for indicating to the PSC that a&#13;
proposed activity may be inconsistent with World Bank rules and requirements and as such may&#13;
not be implemented, it being understood that for PROFISH TFs, the terms of the Bank's Standard&#13;
Provisions set forth in Annex 2 will at all times prevail.&#13;
5.3.   The Focal Point:&#13;
(i)    provides PSC members with regular reports on the status of PROFISH activities;&#13;
(ii)   distributes to PSC members an agenda for each PSC meeting based on views and&#13;
proposals solicited from PSC members;&#13;
(iii)  circulates the records of the deliberations of the PSC to PSC members;&#13;
(iv)   accommodates the comments of PSC members to provide an accurate summary&#13;
record of PSC meetings;&#13;
(v)    receives proposals from PSC members at any time and routes them to the Chair for&#13;
consideration;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-13-&#13;
(vi)   implements the activities supported by PROFISH TFs in accordance with PSC&#13;
guidance and World Bank requirements; and&#13;
(vii)  coordinates the use of PROFISH TFs and DGF funding within the PROFISH work&#13;
program; and&#13;
(viii)  separately, acting for the Bank as trustee, administers PROFISH TFs in accordance&#13;
with Bank rules and requirements.&#13;
5.4.   During the PROFISH start-up period, defined as the period prior to the time when the&#13;
PSC approves the first PROFISH work program and budget and agrees on the criteria for&#13;
selection of PROFISH target countries the Focal Point may:&#13;
(i)    disburse PROFISH TFs funds on activities with respect to countries and regions that&#13;
already have expressed a strong interest to the World Bank to improve their sector&#13;
governance; and&#13;
(ii)   authorize the recipient[s] of DGF funds to disburse such funds for activities in the&#13;
preliminary work program proposal of the recipient.&#13;
6.     AMENDMENTS&#13;
6.1.   Amendments to the Governance Arrangements for PROFISH may be made by&#13;
affirmative agreement by all PSC members and will amendment this Annex 3 accordingly. Such&#13;
affirmative agreement may not arise from a mere lapse of a no objection period whereas&#13;
affirmative agreement by all members present at a PSC meeting will be sufficient. The Focal&#13;
Point will maintain and distribute clear records of any such amendments.&#13;
