and Beyond&#13;
&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success&#13;
factorsâ&#128;&#153; selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the African&#13;
Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The water and sanitation sector in the Democratic Republic     disbursements have lagged well behind commitments.&#13;
of the Congo (DRC) suffered a great setback during the         Annual investment spending for water supply and sanitation&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s long political crisis through the 1990s and early    averaged only about US$65 million over the period 2007â&#128;&#147;&#13;
2000s. Since then, the sector has started to recover, albeit   08 which is roughly US$1 per capita. Most of this spending,&#13;
slowly. Basic water supply and sanitation needs are still      about US$55 million, was for water supply, with 95 percent&#13;
immense. Today, an estimated 50 million Congoleseâ&#128;&#148;             funded by external aid.&#13;
which is 75 percent of the populationâ&#128;&#148;do not have access&#13;
to safe water, and approximately 80-90 percent do not          At this stage, weak implementation capacity measured in&#13;
have access to improved sanitation.                            terms of annual budget utilization rates is the prime factor&#13;
                                                               limiting the pace of recovery and development of the&#13;
The key bottleneck that currently impedes progress             DRCâ&#128;&#153;s water supply and sanitation sector. Going forward,&#13;
in the DRCâ&#128;&#153;s water and sanitation sector is the limited        the critical factors will be a renewed commitment to&#13;
implementation capacity. Even as more finance is becoming      pursue institutional reform and to build capacities where&#13;
available, the sector struggles to absorb it efficiently,      needed to enable the ongoing decentralization of the&#13;
hindered by weak institutions, outdated sector policies, a     sector. More resources will also have to be mobilized&#13;
dearth of qualified technicians and managers, remaining        for provincial water supply and sanitationâ&#128;&#148;programs&#13;
insecurity, and a lack of support infrastructure such as       directed at rural and peri-urban communities. Under the&#13;
roads and electricity. Although recent coverage trends have    â&#128;&#156;maximum possibleâ&#128;&#157; scenario, which assumes progress&#13;
crept upward, and notwithstanding the relatively successful    on these fronts, the annual flow of actual expenditure&#13;
mobilization of external funds, the Millennium Development     could rise to about US$180 million for water supply and&#13;
Goal targets for water supply and sanitation as well as the    about US$25 million for household sanitation, thereby&#13;
much less ambitious national targets set by the DRCâ&#128;&#153;s first    extending access to improved water to an additional 12&#13;

the year 2015, are out of reach.                               estimated under the â&#128;&#156;status quoâ&#128;&#157; or â&#128;&#156;business as usualâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
                                                               scenario. For sanitation the â&#128;&#152;maximum possibleâ&#128;&#153; scenario&#13;
New financial commitments to the sector over the period        could yield improved sanitation for up to 8 instead of only&#13;
2007â&#128;&#147;08 averaged around US$170 million annually, funded        2 million Congolese.&#13;
almost entirely by donors, and have since risen further. The&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Improve implementation capacity and financial management across the sector.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Complete the institutional reform, in particular:&#13;
  	   o	 Ratify the new Water Law (Code de lâ&#128;&#153;Eau) and specify a new sector policy;&#13;
  	   o	 Rationalize the institutional framework at federal and provincial levels to achieve clear responsibilities within the&#13;
         new decentralized framework; and&#13;
  	   o	 Progressively transfer responsibilities for infrastructure to provinces and the decentralized territorial entities&#13;
         (ETDs).&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Introduce a more coherent, comprehensive, and detailed sector monitoring and evaluation framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Prepare provincial water programs combining investment and capacity building.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Improve implementation capacity by:&#13;
  	   o	 Redefining the role of the National Service for Rural Water Supply (SNHR) and the Provincial Water and Sanitation&#13;
         Committees (CPAEAs) in the new decentralized framework; and&#13;
  	   o	 Promoting the training of local water technicians and enterprises.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Ensure that increased resources are mobilized for investment in rural areas.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Expand successful existing programsâ&#128;&#148;in particular, the Autonomous Community-Based Water Systems project and&#13;
     the Villages Assainis program.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Ensure that the SNHR borehole program builds up local capacity for operation and maintenance, drawing on the&#13;
     experience of the above-mentioned projects.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Formalize the status of user associations and small autonomous systems in the regulatory framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Implement the recovery plan for the national water utility (Programme de Redressement de la REGIDESO).&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Revisit the choice of technologies to achieve better cost effectiveness.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Recalibrate the geographic and social targeting of urban interventions to give greater priorities to secondary urban&#13;
       centers and basic service provision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Develop a sector policy within the emerging decentralized institutional framework.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Expand the Villages Assainis and Ã&#137;coles Assainies programs implemented by the Ministry of Public Health in&#13;
     cooperation with UNICEF.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Improve Aid and Investment Management Platformâ&#128;&#153;s (PGAI) monitoring by separating out tracking of rural sanitation&#13;
     funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Develop a sector policy within the emerging decentralized institutional framework.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Improve the monitoring of the PGAI by separating out tracking of urban sanitation funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in&#13;
collaboration with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other stakeholders during&#13;
2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage&#13;
expansion in water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation&#13;
with government and other sector stakeholders. A regional synthesis report, available separately, presents best practice&#13;
and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

Between 1990 and the early 2000s, as the Democratic              based on extrapolations from known water service points&#13;
Republic of the Congo reached the low point of its long          and the judgment of sector experts. The calculations are&#13;

&#13;
Recent data suggest that the advent of relative stability        As Table 1 highlights, the DSCRP access statistics also differ&#13;
since the mid-2000s has been associated with a halt, and         considerably from the â&#128;&#156;coverage ratesâ&#128;&#157; found by recent&#13;
even slight reversal, of this negative trend in the sector.      nationally representative surveys (Multiple Indicator Cluster&#13;
Access rates to safe water are believed to have increased        Surveyâ&#128;&#148;MICS2, EnquÃªte 1-2-3, Demographic and Health&#13;
slightly to around 24 percent nationally in 2008, that is,       Survey â&#128;&#147; DHS), which are used to calculate the figures of&#13;
from 12 percent to 17 percent in rural areas and from            the global UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme&#13;
37 percent to 38 percent in urban areas. These national          (JMP).5 Probable reasons for this discrepancy are outlined&#13;
access estimates, however, conceal large disparities             in Section 6 on Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E). In&#13;
between regions. Data on access to improved sanitation           general, the more pessimistic DSCRP access statistics are&#13;

The rehabilitation and development of water supply               It should be noted, however, that in spite of the different&#13;
services is one of the five priorities (Cinq Chantiers) to       level of access shown by sector-estimates and survey-&#13;
which the government committed itself; it is given priority      statistics respectively, the trends they describe are very&#13;
in the 2006 Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper          similar. Both show a collapse in safe water access after&#13;
(DSCRP I). Sector planners recognized that the Millennium        1990, and a stabilization and slight recovery since the&#13;
Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the proportion          mid-2000s, and low-level stagnation or only minor&#13;
of those with no access to basic services by 2015, relative      improvement for access to improved sanitation. The post-&#13;

targets. The current national targets specified in the           lines, which are derived using linear regression of multiple&#13;
DSCRP are indicated in Figure 1 and call for the following:      household surveys.&#13;

to 49 percent by 2015; and (b) raising access to improved        Figure 1 illustrates that current trends are insufficient to&#13;
sanitation from 9 percent to 45 percent. The MDG targets         reach either the national targets for water or sanitation&#13;
for water supply and sanitation are 70 percent and 55            or the more ambitious MDGs. As this report will argue,&#13;

A word of caution regarding the use of water and sanitation      to reaching its targets than past trends suggest (here&#13;
access statistics in the DRC must be introduced at this point:   referred to as the â&#128;&#156;maximum possibleâ&#128;&#157; scenario).&#13;

Although improving the capacity to absorb finance and          mobilize and effectively disburse these sums is currently&#13;
realize infrastructure efficiently is currently the priority   out of reach for the DRC, the CSO2 estimates that key&#13;
concern in the sector, the volume of finance will also have    reforms and a concerted effort to mobilize funding could&#13;
to rise further if the immense needs of the population of      raise annual investments to around US$180 million in&#13;
the DRC are to be met. Here, the CSO2 analysis provides        the water sector, and US$25 million for sanitation in&#13;
estimates of the amount of funding that (a) can credibly       the coming years. These â&#128;&#156;maximum possibleâ&#128;&#157; amounts,&#13;
be absorbed if key reforms are carried out, and (b) would      effectively implemented, would be well above investment&#13;
be required to reach national targets. The CSO2 costing        flows in the recent past, as shown in Table 2 and discussed&#13;
model estimates these finance requirements based on            in greater detail in Section 5 on Financing. The â&#128;&#156;maximum&#13;
the best available per capita cost data for various water      possibleâ&#128;&#157; scenario also assumes that public investments&#13;
and sanitation technologies, matched with statistics on        will leverage user contributions, at different rates&#13;
technology prevalence in the DRC and the number of             depending on subsector (Figure 2).7 If realized efficiently,&#13;
additional persons to be served to reach national targets      this could extend access to safe water to an additional&#13;

capacity under the so-called â&#128;&#156;maximum possibleâ&#128;&#157;                only 6 million if current trends continued unchanged. For&#13;
scenario has been judged based on past spending, and           sanitation, the â&#128;&#156;maximum possibleâ&#128;&#157; scenario could yield&#13;
an analysis of existing institutional structures, possible     improved sanitation for up to 8 instead of only 2 million&#13;
reforms, and realistically achievable mobilization of funds.   Congolese by 2015.&#13;
While the lack of comprehensive, reliable statistics in the&#13;
DRC undermines the precision of financial estimates, it        The CSO2 estimates assume a considerable shift from&#13;

3.	 Reform Context:&#13;
	 Introducing the CSO2 Scorecard&#13;
&#13;
The water and sanitation sector in the DRC is now in             of reform progress along the service delivery pathway. The&#13;
the midst of fundamental reforms initiated by the new            CSO2 scorecard assesses the building blocks of service&#13;
Constitution (2006), the laws for the reform of public           delivery in turn: three building blocks which relate to&#13;
enterprises and the disengagement of the state (2007),           enabling services; three which relate to developing new&#13;
and the Decentralization Law (2008), which has moved             services; and three which relate to sustaining services.&#13;
responsibilities away from the central government. A             Each building block is assessed against specific indicators&#13;
comprehensive new Water Law has been in development              and scored from 1 to 3 accordingly.9 The scorecards for&#13;
since 2007. Its final draft was accepted in a broad              each subsector are displayed in Sections 7 to 10 of this&#13;
stakeholder review in September 2010, to be tabled late          report, but key insights are summarized here. Analyzing&#13;
2010. Basic targets for the water and sanitation sector have     the service delivery pathway of the DRC in this systematic&#13;
been formulated in the DSCRP (2006), and two successive          way reveals a number of key points in greater detail.&#13;
Priority Action Programs (PAP I &amp; II) have undertaken first&#13;
steps to attain these.                                           The DSCRP I (2007â&#128;&#147;10) and associated PAPs provide a basic&#13;
                                                                 planning framework that will extend through 2010 until&#13;
Going forward, the key reform objective will be to pass          the rollout of DSCRP II (2011â&#128;&#147;15) and the related Five-Year&#13;
the proposed Water Law and then translate the new                Development Plan currently under preparation. At least in&#13;
framework into reality by developing a clear sector policy       the urban water sector, institutional responsibility is clearly&#13;
and streamlining the institutional structure accordingly, as     assigned to the national utility REGIDESO, which has its&#13;
well as reinforcing capacity. So far, reform efforts have been   own planning tools. Yet, compared to a peer group of the&#13;
focused on the national water utility REGIDESO, which is         poorest low-income African countries (with gross national&#13;
responsible for urban water supply and a natural target of       income, GNI, below US$500 per capita)10 the DRCâ&#128;&#153;s water&#13;
reform efforts given its central importance in urban areas       supply and sanitation enabling environment is still lagging&#13;
and its remaining capacity. The government has launched          behind (Figure 3). There are a number of reasons for this.&#13;

combining reform, commercialization, upgrading of                provide basic targets, key priorities, and some investment&#13;
management, and investments. While also affected                 preparation, they do not yet amount to comprehensive,&#13;
by the broad reforms in the legal framework, the rural           detailed, sectorwide planning. In particular, there is no&#13;
water sector, and sanitation in general, have received less      nationwide policy or planning for rural water supply. This&#13;
systematic attention so far. These subsectors have seen a        subsector is formally the responsibility of the National&#13;
trend from ad hoc initiatives by the UN and aid agencies,        Service for Rural Water Supply (SNHR) within the Ministry&#13;
in particular UNICEF and Belgian Technical Cooperation           of Rural Development, but its current capacity is weak.&#13;
(BTC), toward more programmatic approaches addressing            Sanitation and hygiene improvements are integrated&#13;
capacity and sustainability concerns. However, dedicated         in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programs&#13;
and empowered institutions and specific, comprehensive           targeting rural communities and schools, as is the case&#13;
planning frameworks are still largely absent.                    for the Villages Assainis and Ecoles Assainies programs&#13;
                                                                 implemented by the Ministry of Public Health with support&#13;
This basic overview puts the service delivery pathway in         from UNICEF. But these have yet to be scaled up and fully&#13;
context, which can now be explored in detail using the           institutionalized. Urban sanitation has been the object&#13;

A further factor that constrains the enabling environment             operators; and monitoring sector development efficiently.&#13;
in the DRC is the national budgeting process. Budgeted                Some steps to put these basic elements of sustainability&#13;
amounts are generally insufficient to meet stated targets;            in place have been taken, with basic monitoring through&#13;
the budget process is opaque and largely irrelevant as it             national household surveys (DHS, MICS, EnquÃªte 1-2-3)&#13;

of the state contribution to the sector has been negative             success in ensuring sufficient uptake to at least keep up&#13;

administrative expenses (about US$1 million) and to                   at best, cost recovery is low, tariff reviews limited to some&#13;
REGIDESO investments (averaging about US$4 million per                areas and not followed up on, and spare part markets are&#13;
year over 2006â&#128;&#147;08).                                                   underdeveloped.&#13;
&#13;
The key bottleneck in the service delivery pathway across             Overall, the CSO scorecard shows that the DRC still lags&#13;
subsectors concerns the development of new infrastructure,            behind its economic peer group of African countries in all&#13;
that is, the weak capacity of the DRC to effectively and              three sections of the service delivery pathwayâ&#128;&#148;enabling,&#13;

ground. Disbursement rates for funds committed across                 DRCâ&#128;&#153;s water supply and sanitation sector is particularly&#13;
subsectors are generally below 50 percent. Procedures                 lacking in its capacity to absorb and effectively disburse&#13;
to systematically involve local stakeholders in planning              funds, implement projects, and thus develop new services&#13;
and implementation are yet to be fully institutionalized              on the ground (Figure 3).&#13;
and implemented. Current infrastructure development&#13;
is off-track for reaching either the national, or the more            Figure 3&#13;
ambitious MDG, targets. Water quality standards, where                Average scorecard results for enabling,&#13;
                                                                      developing, and sustaining service delivery, and&#13;
they exist, are generally not enforced. There are no set&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
To a considerable extent, the underlying reasons for&#13;
these problems in developing new infrastructure relate&#13;
to the general weakness of the state in the DRC, which&#13;
is only slowly emerging from major armed conflict and&#13;
political turbulence, with a vast, inaccessible and politically&#13;
polarized territory, scarce human capital, and a lack of&#13;
basic support infrastructure such as roads and electricity.&#13;
More specifically, as Section 4 will outline, the institutional&#13;
framework in the water and sanitation sector, which is&#13;

Since the resumption of international cooperation in                       for about 2.3 percent of total public expenditures including&#13;
the early 2000s, the DRCâ&#128;&#153;s water supply and sanitation                     aid flows in these years, that is, approximately 0.6 percent&#13;
sector has attracted considerable external support, initially              of the gross domestic product (GDP) and roughly US$1&#13;
directed at emergency and straightforward rehabilitation                   per capita per annum. The direct contributions from the&#13;
interventions, but now increasingly evolving towards                       state have been limited and on balance negative due to&#13;
multiyear programs with institutional components.                          the failure of public institutions to pay their water bills.14&#13;

The DRCâ&#128;&#153;s rural water access statistics should thus be seen      Figure 10&#13;

underperformance of the rural water sector is particularly&#13;

its finances are in disarray. The low expenditure score is&#13;
due to lagging implementation, with total disbursements&#13;

According to government statistics (DSCRP/UNDP), access                        stakeholders in the DRC judge the more pessimistic access&#13;

Household survey-based estimates by the JMP paint a                            The DRCâ&#128;&#153;s nationwide rural sanitation statistics should thus&#13;
slightly different picture, showing an increase from around                    be seen as an approximation of the true situation, which&#13;

The reason for this difference in level and trend of measured&#13;

 National statistics for urban improved sanitation in the                         and do not work anymore, with virtually all treatment plants&#13;
 DRC indicate stagnation of coverage at a very low level of                       out of service. To the extent that improved sanitation is&#13;
 around 10 percent since 1990. Household survey-based                             available in cities, this is primarily due to private initiative,&#13;
 estimates by the JMP show the same stagnating trend line,                        without public control or planning, and generally very&#13;
 albeit at a slightly higher level of 23 percent (Figure 19).                     rudimentary technology. Current trends are insufficient&#13;
 In general, sector stakeholders in the DRC tend to prefer                        for the DRC to attain either its national DSCRP goal or its&#13;
 the more pessimistic access figures. However, as discussed                       overall MDG sanitation target.&#13;
 earlier, these should be seen as an approximation of the&#13;
 true situation only, which further varies greatly between                        Given the limited capacities in the urban sanitation sector&#13;
 different provinces and urban centers.                                           at present (see Section 4 and Figure 21), it is unlikely&#13;

 statistics, as well as feedback from sector experts, that                        were available. Needs, however, are enormous: the&#13;
 the urban sanitation sector is in disarray. The few historic                     CSO2 calculations show that if the institutional capacity&#13;
 wastewater networks in cities have not been maintained                           to implement urban sanitation programs at scale was in&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in the
            Democratic Republic of Congo : turning finance into services
            for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what
            underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what
            its member governments can do to accelerate that progress
            across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with United Nations
            Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization
            (WHO) in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has
            been produced in collaboration with the Government of the
            Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other
            stakeholders during 2009-10. The analysis aims to help
            countries assess their own service delivery pathways for
            turning finance into water supply and sanitation services in
            each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and
            rural and urban sanitation and hygiene. The CSO2 analysis
            has three main components: i) a review of past coverage; ii)
            a costing model to assess the adequacy of future
            investments; and iii) a scorecard which allows diagnosis of
            particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.
            The CSO2's contribution is to answer not only whether
            past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector
            targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to
            ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated
            coverage expansion in water supply and sanitation. In this
            spirit, specific priority actions have been identified
            through consultation with government and other sector
            stakeholders. A regional synthesis report, available
            separately, presents best practice and shared learning to
            help realize these priority actions.
