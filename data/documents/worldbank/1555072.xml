IWY THE. EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTMES ARE NOT MADE IN COLOMPIA&#13;
A case study in Latin Americar. and East Asian manufactured exports&#13;
This study focusses on the exports of a particular commodity (clothing)&#13;
from a particular Latin American country (Colombia) in an attempt to tnderstand&#13;
why Latin America has been so mti-h less successful at exporting manufactured&#13;
goods to       0ia -h.u L.st Asia.  Part I analyzes and attempts to explain the,curious&#13;
pattern of Colombia's clothing exports during 1967-78. Part II delves in detail&#13;
into the price and non-price reasons why Hlong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, whose&#13;
combined population is less than 2-1/2 times that of Colombia, export garments&#13;
whose value is ISO times that of Colombia's clothing exports, Part III summarizes&#13;
some of the main conclusions, draws out some policy options that are available&#13;
to Colombia, and examines the extent to which the findings are generalizable to&#13;
other manufacturing industr4cs and other Latin Am-rican countries. The study&#13;
was done under a World Bank research project, Marketing Mlanufactured Exports&#13;
(671-56).&#13;

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS&#13;
I am indebted to the lYorld Bank for fi.Lancing this study.&#13;
Donald Keesii.g acted as the project's mentor at the World Bank; he,&#13;
Thomas lHu.clheson, many others at the Bank, and Lawrence lhortzel of&#13;
Boston University offered numerous helpftul su;gestions in the planning&#13;
and 1l.ter stages. Mlartha Bermudez did a superb job as research assistant&#13;
during the Colombian field work. Juan Jose Echavarria of FEDESARROLLO,&#13;
assisted by Mauricio Cepeda, ccr,structcd real and effective exchange&#13;
rates specific to the clothing industry' with painstaking care.&#13;
Guillermo Perry of FEDESARROLLO was instrumental in deriving the formulas&#13;
for the effective valuLe of the various Colombian export incentives;&#13;
Juan Jose Echavarria and Luis Jorge Garay also assisted in thlis regard.&#13;
Leong liew, then at Monash University, wrote an informative background&#13;
paper surveying the literature on export marketing problems.   To all&#13;
of these people I am truly grateful. Finally, I owe a special vote of&#13;
thanks to the businessmeni in Colombia and New York  and to the officials&#13;
of government and private agencies and institutions in Colombia   who&#13;
gave so freely of their time and information in interviews. Without&#13;
their help, this study would not havc been possible.   Despite the&#13;
assistance of so many, 1, alone, am responsible for any remaining errors&#13;
and for all views expressed.&#13;

2.  MIhy dild thiese exports decl inic just as suiddenly atter 19741?&#13;
,     3.  Why is it that Coic jbib has been So muCh less suCcessful at&#13;

Kong exported $2.9 billion of apparel in 1977, Korea $2.0 billion&#13;
and Taiwan $1.3 billion.)2)&#13;
41. More generally, what can be I caineod from Colombia's experionce&#13;
w ith clothiing exports about thc reasons %,hy latin American nationr havi:e&#13;
beeni less successful at exh)orting most types of manufactured goods than&#13;
llong Kong, Korea and Taiwan? [Do the La.st Asqians have cheaper labor, do&#13;
thley worl; harder, dlo they halve a transport cost advantage, dlo they receive&#13;
massive government subsidies, are they b(tter at selliing the goods - or what?&#13;
If a key aim of this study is to learn something genera l about the&#13;
reasons for the relat ively poor l)erformance of La tin Nmerica  (not just&#13;
Coiomhia) in exporting manufactur-es (not just clothing), %.hy, it might be&#13;

1.  MIost of the largest exporters (nine of the top twelve in terms of the&#13;
value of exports).&#13;
2.  Some medium-sized and somc small exportcrs (size is measured here both&#13;
in terms of the value of exports and     the number of employces).&#13;
3.  Several firms that had been important exporters in 1974 but which sold&#13;
little or nothing abroad in 1977.&#13;
4.- Most of the firms that had requcsted quota allocations for exports to&#13;
the United-States for.the textile year 1978-79 (fourteen of the seven-&#13;
teen).&#13;
S. Three small firms that had been associated with a recently-failed ex-&#13;
port consortium.&#13;
6.  As many intermediaries as could be found (five).&#13;
7.  Firms located in six cities - Barranquilla, Bogota, Cali, Manizales,&#13;
Medellin and Percira - and in the Free Zone of Barranquilla.&#13;
Martha Bermudez and I also interviewed thc directors of the three&#13;
full- or part-time foreign buying offices for clothing that %ere then&#13;
located in Bogota", as wCll as officials of the Colombian foreign trade insti-&#13;

Free Zone in Barranquilla, and the private economic consulting firm&#13;
FEDESAPROLLO.  Later, in Mtarch 1979, I spent a week in New York interview-&#13;
ing executives of fourteen U.S. corporations that import or have imported&#13;
clothing from firms in the sample.   'I'hese corporations included importer-&#13;
wholesalers, importer-manufacturers, tldpartment store chains, independent&#13;

In keeping with the ind(luctive nature of tlhe investigation, ai flexible&#13;
intervliw  guide WZas used in all interviews rather than a rigid quiestion-&#13;
nairc, and respondents were encouraged to relate their experieoce wiLcII Co-&#13;
lombian clotlhing exports (or imports) in tlheir owr. words and in th -ir own&#13;
sequence.   Ihe main advantage of this metlhod is that it minimizes the like-&#13;
lIthool tha.t important aspects of the story w0ll be inissel.  Its main dis -&#13;
advantage is thait. respondents whlo cxpatiate on areas of-particular interest&#13;
cannot alh;iys be asked all of the questions th,at are in the ;nterview guide&#13;
because C o  Ilack- of time.  On IXilance, in this stuidy  the advantages of the&#13;

export funiction in the firm. Finally, there were questions concerning con-&#13;
soitia of small firms, intermediaries, quotas, the role of government, and&#13;
plans for the future.   In most cases, the interview was followed by a brief&#13;
plant visit. The complete interview guide is reproduced in Appendix A.&#13;
The main areas that were covered in the interviews with U.S. clotlhing&#13;
buyers in New York include the detailed history of the buyer's experience&#13;
in purchasing clothing from Colombia, the impact of       U.S. import quotas&#13;
on the buyer's import strategy, Colombia's main perceived strengths and&#13;
weaknesses as a clothing exporter in comparison with other Latin American&#13;
countries and with East Asia, and the buyer's plans, if any, for future&#13;
imports of clothing from Colombia.&#13;
The interviews with the Colombian clothing exporters varied in length&#13;
between one and four hours, with the majority taking between 12 and 22&#13;
hours.  The interviews with U.S. buyinig firms in New York ranged from 30&#13;
minutes to 2 hours, with the maiority taking from I to 12 hours.&#13;
2       '2&#13;
Only one firm in the Colombian sample refused outright to be inter-&#13;
viewed. HJowever, sixteen companies in the initial sample that were re-&#13;
gistered as having exported clothing during 1974 and/or 1977 had disap-&#13;
peared by the last quarter of 1978. The owner-manager of one of these firms&#13;
had been kidnapped during 1978;    in a second case, we were told&#13;
that the secret police, DAS, was also looking for the firm; while fire had&#13;
destroyed the plant of a third.   In the remaining thirteen cases,there was&#13;
no answer at the telephone number or address that we had     and we were unable&#13;
to locate the enterprise througlh INCONIEX, through PROEXPO, or by other means.&#13;
In an additional four cases we could not arrange an interview in the limited&#13;
time that was available, usually because the person to be interviewed was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
busy or was out of town while we were in a particular city.    Finally, in one&#13;
case the interviewee failed to appear at the appointed time and then failed&#13;
twice to return calls.&#13;
The policy followed in cases of non-response was to t;y as far as pos-&#13;
sible to replace the firm in the sample with another of similar size and&#13;
characteristics in the same city. This worked out quite well, and there&#13;
seems to be ro particular reason to expect that non-response has biased the&#13;
findingZs of the study one way or another. The reason why such a relatively&#13;
large number of firms could not be located is substantive rather than tech-&#13;
nical, as will become clear in Ch'-tcr 1.&#13;

PART 1.  THE RISE AND FALL OF COLOMBIA'S CLOTHING EXPORTS?&#13;
There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.&#13;
- Disraeli&#13;
Chapter 1&#13;
LIES, DAMNED LIES AND STATISTICS&#13;
According to the statistics compiled by INCOMEX, Colombia's registered&#13;
clothing exports increased rapidly from $1 million in 1970 to $77 million&#13;
in 1974, fell dramatically to $29 million in 1975, and began to recover&#13;
thereafter, without regaining the 1974 level by 1978 (see Table 1.1). ) 2)&#13;
Unfortunately, the statistics tell ratlher less than the whole trutlh.&#13;
1. Throughout the tables in this study, n.a. indicates that data are not&#13;
available. Sums, products and quotients of columns and rows do not&#13;
always agree with column and row totals because many figures havc&#13;
been rounded.  For some variables (including the value of clothinig&#13;
exports), the fact that alternative sources give varying estimates&#13;
means that the data in different tables do not always agree.&#13;
2. Partial, preliminary figures for the first half of 1979 suggest that&#13;
registered clothing exports may have surpassed $77 million in that&#13;
year (FEDESARV)LLO, 1979a, p. 41).&#13;

REGISTRATIONS AND NLANIFESTS&#13;
The main advantage of the INCOMEX data on export registrations and&#13;
the reason that they are so widely used in Colombia   is that they are&#13;
published,or at least made available fcr public inspection, with minimal&#13;
delay.  lheir main drawback, a serious one, is that they are based on&#13;
plans rather than deeds. Any firm that receives an order foe its goods&#13;
from abroad is required to submit to INCONIEX a form registering its&#13;
intention to export. The INCOMEX export registrations tabulations are&#13;
based directly and solelv on these forms. But there's many a slip&#13;
'twixt the cup and the lip: in particular, orders are sometimes cancelled.&#13;
Fortunately, there exists a second set of (more tardily published)&#13;
data against which the INCOMEX figures can be checked.1)&#13;
At the time that a bundle of export goods crosses the Colombian&#13;
customs border, a second form, or manifest, has to be signed by customs&#13;
officers. The signatures of these officials serve to verify that they&#13;
have seen the merchandise cross the border. DANE publishes a set of&#13;
1.  An additional set of registrations data is compiled by the&#13;
central banX (Banco de la Republica) in connection with the&#13;
foreign exchange aspects of exporting.   These figurcs follow the&#13;
same general trend as those of INCOMEX.   For example, for 1971-7/,&#13;
they give clothing exports as (S millions): 1.7, 2.1, 28.6, 82.7,&#13;
32.4, 37.3, and 47.3 (PROEXIPO, unpublished summary of unpublished&#13;
Banco de la Republica tabulations).&#13;

port data that is based entirely' on thcse manifests. 1)&#13;
As can be seen from the second coltunn of Table 1.1 , the DANF data differ&#13;
.o some extent from those of INCOMEX.  In part, this discrepancy is no doubt&#13;
aused by leads and lags: goods registered for export latc one year may phy-&#13;
;ically cross the customs border early the following year. But for 1973&#13;
Lnd 1974, the INCOMEX figures exceed the DANE numbers by $13 and $25 million&#13;
66 and 48 percent of DANE exports) respectively. It seems that in those two&#13;
ears, which marked the beginning of recession in the industrialized coun-&#13;
ries, an unusually large number of orders may have been cancelled.   What-&#13;
ver the reason for the difference between the two sets of data, the DANE&#13;
'igures are clearly more useful for the present purposes than those of INCOMEX.&#13;
:ONSTANI PRICES&#13;
If U.S. producer (wholesale) prices are taken as the yardstick, world&#13;
Jlothing prices increased by 50 percent between 1967 and 19789 Thus it is&#13;
iecessary to convert the DANE series to constant prices to reveal the trend&#13;
n the voltume of Colombia's clothing exports over the period.  This is done&#13;
.n the third column of Table 1 .1&#13;
The DANE data presented in Table 1.1 are takeni from an ANDI publication&#13;
rather than from DANE itself because the AN[)I source gives the longest&#13;
consistent series on total clothing exports that is available. Some data pub-&#13;
lished by DANE differ slightly from those in Table 1.1 (presumably be-&#13;
cause of differences in the way that particular items are classified)&#13;
but the underlying trend is thc same.   For example, for 1972-76 DANE&#13;
(1978, Table 7) gives clothing exports as ($millions):   4.6, 16.9,&#13;
48.7, 24.7, 34.7.&#13;
Z.  The wholesale price index for clothing increased rather more slowly&#13;
during 1970-78 than the unit value index for U.S. apparel imports.   The&#13;
latter was heavily influenced by upgrading of the quality and product&#13;
composition of East Asian imports and by rising Last Asian quota premia&#13;
(Keesing, 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FICTITIOUS EXPORTS&#13;
Nothing in the manipulations so far has either explained or removed&#13;
the odd 1974 peak: as may be seen in Fig. 1.1, the constant-price, mani-&#13;
fest-based data lhave the same general shape as the current-price registra-&#13;
tion-based figures.  The peak, nevertheless, is a mirage.    The explanation,&#13;
as related by a number of clothing exporters, seemns to be something likc&#13;
the following.&#13;
In 1974, the price of Colombian coffee fell to its lowest level in&#13;
real terms in over 25 years. In the same year, for a variety of reasons,&#13;
there was a surge in the demand for imports, with the result that the&#13;
current account of Colombia's balance of payments was deeper in deficit than&#13;
i; had been in all but one of the previous fourteen years (Table 1.2).&#13;
Needing dollars,to import foodstuffs and aware of the existence in the&#13;
country of a large pool of some tens, and maybe already hundreds, of mil-&#13;
lions of "black" dollars generated by the drug trade, the outgoing goveln-&#13;
ment of Misael Pastrana Borrero let it be known informally that persons ex-&#13;
changing dollars at the Banco de la Rep'blica would receive the full offi-&#13;
cial exchange rate, and would not be asked whence the dollars were obtained.&#13;
This attracted few dollars, however, since in 1974 the black mar-&#13;
ket exchange rate for the dollar was still five percent above the official&#13;
rate. )  The government therefore let it be known informally that anyone&#13;
who claimed to have exported some goods and who could present an export manifest&#13;
signed by a customs officer as documentation of this would receive the&#13;
full official exchange rate for the dollars allegedly so received plus&#13;
1. From 1975 onwards there were so many millions of black dollars in the&#13;
country that the black market exchange rate was one to six percent&#13;
below the official rate (Table 1.2, column 3).&#13;

reasons that a)r not altogether clear, clothing anpeai; to have becn nnc of&#13;
the most popular items for hoioers of black doli.'rs to recister on their&#13;
manifests.  This, it seems that at least part of the 1974 peak in clothing&#13;
exports is in fact accouotited for by fake invoicing, or, as the phenomenon&#13;
is known widely in Colombia, by fictitious exports.   (Althoughi some people&#13;
dispute whether the government p'ayed as implicitiy active a role as this&#13;
account suggests, I know of no one whlo denies that fictitious exports of&#13;
clothing took place.  Of course, fake invoicing by exiporters is by no means&#13;
'stricte(d to Colombia.)&#13;
A number of indepenident pieces of evidence are consistei:t with this.&#13;
explanatior of the apparent 1974 peiak. To begin with, there is no indica-&#13;
tion of any sharp increase in aggregate output or value added in the (:olom-&#13;
bian clothing industry in 1974.   On thlc contrary, in the sane year thiat the DANF&#13;
Tstatistics show clothing exports trebling as a percentage of clothiing pro-&#13;
'duction  and increasing as a percentage of total industrial exports, out-&#13;
put and val,Le added in clothing both fell sijnificantly in reial terms, and&#13;
they also fell as a percentage of output and value added in all industry.&#13;
True, employment in clothing grew in 1974; but the increase was only one&#13;
percent  which was less than the increment in each of the previous five years.&#13;
Employment in ciothing as a percent of all manufactulrinig employment declinled&#13;

Second, returning to the non-response question for a moment, by far the&#13;
largest single group of firms that were included in the sample for this study&#13;
but could not be located were companies that were registered as having ex-&#13;
ported large quan.ities of clothing in 1974 but had since disappeared. The&#13;
largest of these companies in terms of the value of registered exports was&#13;
named Los Alamos. This firm registered with INCOMEX its intention to export&#13;
S12 million in 1974, which is twice as i.uch as any other clothing firm has re-&#13;
gistered before or since. Los Alamos would have hald to have at least 1,000 em-&#13;
ployees to do business on this scale - yet no one whom I approached in the&#13;
clothing industry, in ANDI, or in the government had ever heard of it. Nor&#13;
is Los Alamos alone: five other firms that were registered as exporting&#13;
over $2 million each in 1974 seem to be known to no one.    (Only five&#13;
of the firms interviewed for the present study hiave ever registered exports&#13;
of over $2 million in a single year   and all of them are very well known&#13;
indeed).  In light of the close contact that officials of ANDI, INCONEX&#13;
and PROEXPO maintain with the largest exporting firms, this ignorance is sug-&#13;
gestive to say the least. It seems, in fact, that these six firms, along&#13;
with an unknown number of others that were registered as exporting garments&#13;
in 1974, never existed except as a device for carrying out fictitious ex-&#13;
ports. 1)&#13;
Interviewees wlho spoke about fictitious exports agreed unanimously&#13;
that firms registering them were most Mikely to claim to be sending goods&#13;
to Panama, the Caribbean, or possibly Venezuela, and were least likely,&#13;
because of fear of legal complications, to nominate the United States as&#13;
1. The obverse side of this coin is that the clothing exporting firms&#13;
that were interviewed for this study accounted for 50 to 73 percent of&#13;
all registered clothing exports during 1975-78, but only 22 percent of&#13;
such exports in 1974 (Table 3.2 below).&#13;

the intended destination.  The INCOMEX statistics on registered clothing ex-&#13;
ports by destination are consistent with this reasoning.   Panamal, which did&#13;
not receive more than $4 million in clothing from Colombia in any one year&#13;
during 1975-77, is registered as having received $23 million in 1974 and&#13;
the 1974 figures for Venezuela, Aruba and Curacao seem also to be somewvhat&#13;
inflated. By contrast, registered exports to the United States in 1974&#13;
show no noticeable bulge at all (Table 1.S below).&#13;
It is not possible to obtaiin a precise estimate of the value of ficti-&#13;
tious clothing exports in 1974. Nevertheless, the $27 million registered&#13;
by Los Alamos and the other five firms that seem never to have existed may&#13;
represent,somet: ng of a lower bound.1)If it is taken as such, Colombia's&#13;
true clothing exports in 1977 were not S77 million (INCOMfEX), and not $52&#13;
million (DANE), but at most $25 million, or $19 million in 1967 prices.&#13;
In Fig. ].1, this puts clothing exports for 1974 on or below a straight&#13;
line joining 1973 and 1975.  The peak has completcly disappeared.&#13;
It seems to be generally agreed that fictitious exporting on a large&#13;
scale was restricted mainly to 1974. On Sept. 26 of that year, the newly-&#13;
elected government of Alfonso l6'pez Michelsen announced that the CAT, or&#13;
export subsidy, was being reduced from 15 to 5 percent, partly to discourage&#13;
fictitious exports of clothing and precious stones. It also shook dp the&#13;
1.  This is consistent with Escobar's observation that "rictitious exports&#13;
of clothing were, apparently, greatcr than true exports" (Escobar, 1977,&#13;
p. 27). If some of the fictitious exports registervd with INCOMEX did&#13;
not rwventually "take place" (that is, if the firms did not go through&#13;
with faking the manifests), the adjustment made here will be too great.&#13;
On the other hand, the figure quoted ignores entirely overinv'icinig by&#13;
legitimate firms, which seems, for obvious reasons, to have been quite&#13;
common in 3974.  Fictitious exports thlat were registered but, as a result&#13;
of the new government's mcasures (sce following paragraph), did not reach&#13;
the manifest stage, may help in part to explain the unusually large gap&#13;
between the INCOMEX and DANE export figures for 1974.&#13;

Customs Department and increased the number of signatures required on an&#13;
export manifest from one or two to ten or twelve.   Thcse twin measures, and&#13;
particularly the latter, seem to have had the desired effect. In the words&#13;
of the export manager of one clothing firm: "It would be much too expensive&#13;
to do fictitious exporting now. Not only would you have to pay off many&#13;
more people. Also, each one of them is more honest now than before, so you&#13;
would have to pay him more."&#13;
DESTINATION&#13;
In 1975, the first recent year for which reliable destination data are&#13;
tvailable, half of Colombia's clothing exports went to the United States and&#13;
a further 12 percent went to Europe. Venezuela received a quarter of these&#13;
exports in the'same yeair, the Caribbean took 9 percent 1) and all other coun-&#13;
tries together accounted for 6 percent. Since 1975, however,&#13;
there has been a dramatic change in   the  distribution   of&#13;
destinations.    Exports to the United States and to Europe have fallen&#13;
since 1975 both in current and constant dollars as Colombian firms have&#13;
been gradually forced out of the most competitive markets. 2) This drop has&#13;
been more than offset, on the other hand, by an increase in exports to&#13;
easier markets in Venezuela and the Caribbean. Thus, whereas the United&#13;
States and Europe together received 61 percent of Colombia's clothirg ex-&#13;
ports in 1975, they received only 24 percent in the first half of 1978,&#13;
while the proportion taken by Venezuela and the Caribbean jumped from 33&#13;
to 72 percent during the same period (Table 1.5 and Figs. 1.2 and 1.3).&#13;
1. Throughout the destination section "the Caribbean" is used, for brevity,&#13;
to denote the Caribbean and Panama.&#13;
2. The causes of this decline in the ability to compete in the United States&#13;
and Europe are analyzed in detail in the following two chapters and in&#13;

Colombian data on exports of clothilng to the United States and&#13;
U.S. data on imports of clothing from Colomlbia differ somewhat in absolute&#13;
magnitu6ie. )  Fortunately, howevcr, this difference is less important&#13;
for the present study than the fact that the U.S. data show thc same&#13;
general pattern during most of the period as the Colombian statistics.&#13;
According to U.S. figures, the value of clothing imports from Colombia&#13;
in 1967 prices rose from $1 million in 1970 to $23-24 million in 1971-75,&#13;
fell by 39 percent during the following two years, and recovered&#13;
slightly in 1978 (Tables 1.6 and '.7).    Thcsc data almost certainly&#13;
understate the true extent of the post 1974-75 decline, however,&#13;
largely because the U.S. apparel price index understattes thc true rise&#13;
in U.S. clothing prices. That this is the base mav be secn from U.S. data&#13;
on the volume of clothing imports from Colombia in squtare yard equi-&#13;
valents (SYE's) (Tables 1.8 and 1.9 and :ig. 1.4).2) According to these&#13;
data, apparel imports from Colombia rose from I million SYL's in 1971 to&#13;
25 million SYE's in 1974, fell by 60 percert to 10 million SYE's ir 1977,&#13;
and recovered slightl) to an annual rate of 11 mAillion SYE's during the&#13;
first half of 1979 (Fig. 1.4).&#13;
The post 1974-75 decline in Colombia's exports of apparel to the&#13;
UJnited States did not occur because of a fall in total U.S. imports of&#13;
clothing; on the contrary, the constant price volumc of such imports&#13;
almost doubled during 1974-78.   Rather, it occurred because of a marked&#13;
1.  In the world of internaltional trade statistics, such differences are&#13;
quite common. In the present case, the difference seems to be mainly&#13;
due to the fact that U.S. imports from Colombia under the U.S. offshore&#13;
assembly (807) scheme are recorded at their full valuc in the tJnitecl&#13;
States, whereas only the Colombian valuc added appears in Colombia's export&#13;
statistics.This problem is discussed fulther in the follow.ing section.&#13;
2.  Under the quota agreements that the OInii cl States h;vs with a number of&#13;
countries, each suit exported to the United States is assumcd to embody a ccrtain&#13;
number of square yards of fabric, each shirt ai different number of square&#13;
yards, and so forth. This makes it possible to reduce a country's&#13;
heterogeneous garment exports to the United States to a single "square&#13;
yard equivalent" figure.&#13;

erosion of Colombia's already small share of total U.S. clothing imports.&#13;
By 1978, this share had fallen to 0.6 percent, 60 percent lower than it&#13;
had been three years earlier (Table 1.6). Even among the three items&#13;
that accounted together for two-thirds of the total value of Colombia's&#13;
exports of apparel to the United States during 1978 (Table 1.7 above),&#13;
only in one (blouses of man-made fibers) did Colombia's share of total&#13;
UJ.S. imports increase steadily over time. In the other two (men's&#13;
suits of wool, and coats of man-made fibers) Colombia's share of&#13;
total U.S. imports rose through 1974 or 1975 but then fell sharply&#13;
until by 1978 it was less than a third of what it had been three years&#13;
earlier (Table 1.10).   Finally, a similar erosion of Colombia's share&#13;
of the U.S. import market after 1975 can be seen in the data on U.S.&#13;
mports of clothinlg carried out under the offshore assembly, or item&#13;
07, scheme.  Of the main seven countries using 807 for apparel,&#13;
Colombia was the only one to show a significant fall in the current&#13;
dollar value of its exports after 1975; Just one year later, its share&#13;
of total U.S. imports under the scheme aad fallen from 9 to S percent&#13;
'(Table 1.11).&#13;
Europe&#13;
If clothing exports to the United StaLes have tended to decline since&#13;
1975, exports to the other potentially lucrative but difficult market,&#13;
Europe, have fared little better.   Throughout 1974-77, Colombia's total cloth-&#13;
ing exports to Europe never exceeded $5m. During 1977-78, about half&#13;
of the total was accounted for by just one firm.     This company had&#13;

made a heavy investment in building up not onlv production aLdi marketing&#13;
capabilitics for export  but also a long-term relationship wit h it-S Euro-&#13;
pean buyer; hence, it had a strong vested intcrest in continuitig to export&#13;
and waIs holding out as long as it could.  Of the rest of C(olombia's F.Euro-&#13;
pean exports in 1')77-78, almost one third wzIs purchased b) a single, large&#13;
European departmeint store chain.  When interviewed, the part-timen buyers for&#13;
this chaini in Bogota stated that almost all of the garments that they&gt; werc&#13;
ordering could be bought 10 to 30 percent less expensively in East Asia.&#13;
They explained, however, that their client hals a policy of spreading arouind&#13;
half a million dollars or so in Colombia to ensure that it has a footholdl&#13;
there should there be a cut in European import quotas for apparel from l.ast&#13;
Asia  or should war break out again in Korea.   This explanation was eminent-&#13;
ly believable; assuming an average degree of overpricing in Colombia of,&#13;
say, 20 percent, the total cost of the instirance policy to the chain amount-&#13;
ed to only about $100,000 a year, which is little more than petty cash for&#13;
a corporation of its size. l)&#13;
Venezuela and the Caribbean&#13;
Venezuela and Colombia are both members of the Andean Group integra-&#13;
tion scheme.  Hlowever, like all other members of that scheme, Venezuiela&#13;
has placed clothing on its list of products that are to be exempted from&#13;
1.   3kT1ing at the same (uestion from a micro perspective, a pair of Jeans&#13;
that might cost $6 f.o.b. in Korea or Taiwan tended to cost $7 or $8&#13;
f.o.b. in Colombia.  But since the final retail seIling price was likely&#13;
to be $18 or so, provided the order was marginal (as all (olombian o1rLdeCrS&#13;
were for this chain), the extra expense was hardly not iced.&#13;

tariff liberation. Thus, in practice, thc only way that Colombians can ex-&#13;
port clothing to Venezuela is through the free port of the Miargarita Islands&#13;
(often refcrred to simply as the Islands). Free port status was created&#13;
for the Islands on April 1, 1975; within one year, the number of licensed&#13;
buyers registered there quadrupled from 430 to 1800.&#13;
A Colombian firm wishing to export garments to the Islands generally&#13;
sends them overland to the town of Cucuta, which is located just on the Co-&#13;
lombian side of the Colombo-Venezuelan border. There they are placed on a&#13;
bonded truck, which is driven and ferried to the Islands. Travelers from&#13;
Caracas fly to the Islands to pick up the merchandise in small lots at the&#13;
many stores located there; provided they do not bring home more than a&#13;
suitcase or two of goods, they are- not charged the duties of over 100 percent&#13;
that they would otherwise have to pay.&#13;
The most important characteristic of the Margarita Islands and the Carib-&#13;
bean for the present discussion is that they represent relatively easy mar-&#13;
kets for Colombia - easy in terms of price; easy in terms of fashion, sizing,&#13;
quality control, and delivery times; and easy in terms of marketing arrange-&#13;
ments.&#13;
Because they are small, isolated markets situated well away from the&#13;
major trade routes, the prices that are paid for apparel in the Islands and&#13;
the Caribbean tend to be relatively high. Twenty-four of the thirty Colom-&#13;
bian clotlhing exporters in the sample gave us detailed data on the prices&#13;
that they have received when selling a particular garment or garments both&#13;
domestically and abroad. In only six cases was the export price (including&#13;
the CAT and the value of subsidized credit) greater than or equal to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
domestic price.  In all six instances, the garments in (question were being&#13;
sold in the Islands or thie Caribbean.  By contrast, all of the thiitecn cx-&#13;
porters to thc lUnited States and Europe who gavc uis price comparisons in.li-&#13;
cated that the price receivedl on export sales (again including the va1uc of&#13;
export incentives) was below the domestic price (Table 1.12). In addition to&#13;
having high prices for all, the Islands and the Caribbean halve a seconTd price-&#13;
related attraction that is special to Colombia:  because of their proximity (see&#13;
Map 1. 1),  Colombians can place garments there with signi ficantly lower&#13;
transport costs thani any other clothing-exporting nation.1 &#13;
In fashion, Venezuela and the Caribbean, like Colombia, tend to lag a&#13;
year or more behind the United States and Europe. In addition, because of&#13;
their location near the equator, they experience far less seasonil variation&#13;
in climate, and hence in fasition, than thc richi countries of the north.&#13;
Clothing purchasers in Venezuela antd the Caribbean tend to be of similar&#13;
size and shape to those in Colombia - but different from those in North Amer-&#13;
ica, Europc, and East Asia) - and tleir quality demands tend to be similar-&#13;
ly less rigorous than those of more-developed-country consumers. Partly be-&#13;
cause of the lack of pronounced seasonal variations in climaLc and fashion,&#13;
and partly because the Islands and the Caribbean are less a buyer's market&#13;
in clothing than the United States and Europe, firms gencrally hlalve more&#13;
lead time to produce for export there, and the consequence,' of late lelivery&#13;
are less serious.&#13;
1. Transport costs are analyzed in some detail in Chapter 5&#13;
2. Given that most countries in Latin America maintain higih tariff and li-&#13;
censing or quota barriers against clothinig imports - the Islands in&#13;
Venezuela and Manaos in Brazil arc two of the more important loopiloles&#13;
in the defense system - it is hardly worthwhlile for East Asians to de-&#13;
vote mucli effort to manufatcturing garments to Latin Americain size aIInd&#13;

Like no major world market,-the Islands and parts of the Caribbean use&#13;
the same language as Colombia, which facilitates marketing for some poten-&#13;
tial exporters, especially smaller firms, and gives Colombians an advantage&#13;
over East Asians.   Labelling regulations are less strict in Venezuela and&#13;
the Caribbean than in the United States and Europe and in some cases are&#13;
non-existent.  Since Venezuclan law requires that firms exporting to the&#13;
Islands use a resident representative rather than a travelling salesperson,&#13;
a number of Colombian firms have sent Colombian nationals there to act in&#13;
this capacitv. (East Asians are obviously less likely to be able to compete&#13;
in this regard).&#13;
Sonie of these points may secin relatively minor in themselves. Yet&#13;
together, they add up to sometlhing so impoitant for this study that it would&#13;
be difficult to overemphasize it. A Colombian entrepreneur who wants to&#13;
export clothing to the United States or Europe not only has to compete in&#13;
price with the most efficient firms in the world, he also hias to adopt an&#13;
export mentality. This means that he must be willing and able, among other&#13;
things: to alter his working methods to comply with clients' detailed specifi-&#13;
cations; to implement and maintain a stringent system of quality control; and&#13;
to ensure that all shipments meet their tight delivery dates. By contrast, a&#13;
Colombian exporting to the Islands or the Caribbean: faces price competition only'&#13;
a little tougher than at home; can produce and sell garments to his own speci-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3S -&#13;
cations; can use the sane less-than-strict quality control apparatus that&#13;
he uses for domestic sales; and can be late in delivcring the goods without&#13;
incurring serious penalties. In sum, a Colombian firm selling to the Islands&#13;
and the Caribbean can simply ship to these markets the same goods that it&#13;
sells at home  on much the same terms, whereas a firm exporting to the United&#13;
States or Europe almost invariably lhas to make substantial modifications to its&#13;
product, to the way it is produce~d, and to the way it is marketed. If one&#13;
notes further that the three most popular Caribbean markets for Colombian&#13;
clothing exporters, Aruba, CuraSao and Panama, are located closer to Barran-&#13;
quilla than Bogota is, while the Islands are barely further away, the con-&#13;
clusion is inescapable:   exporting   garments to the Islands  aInd  the Ca-&#13;
ribbean has much more in common with selling domestically than it has with&#13;
exporting to the United States or Europe. It is for this reason that the&#13;
changing destination of Colombia's clothing exports over time - towards the&#13;
Islands and the Caribbean and away from the United States and Europe - is&#13;
so significant.1)&#13;
THE 807 CONMPLICATION&#13;
A further problem with the Colombian clothing export data stems from&#13;
the country's participation in the U.S. offshore assembly (807) scheme.&#13;
Under that arrangement, it may be recalled, fabric and other inputs are made&#13;
and cut in the United States, shipped to Colombia for assembly, and then&#13;
1. Of the 30 firms that we interviewed, eleven were exporting solely to&#13;
the United States and/or Europe in 1978, 15 were exporting solely to&#13;
the Islands and/or the Caribbean, and only four were exporting both&#13;
to the United States and to the Islands or the Caribbean.   'I'hl.s evidcnce&#13;
is consistent with th7 Flaim made above:   these are indeed quite dif-&#13;
ferent markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
shipped back to the United States as finished goods. The cut cloth and other&#13;
inputs that enotr Colombia under 807 iire not paid for by the Colombian assembling&#13;
firm, nor ;-ie -:ey included in the value of Colombian apparel that is regis-&#13;
tered as having been exported to the United States. This means that a pair of&#13;
p*ants costing a total of $6 to produce can appear in the INCOMIEX and DANE lists&#13;
qf Colo-nh:11 txports in three different ways:&#13;
Valuc of exports listed&#13;
Fabric and pants 100% made in Colombia                 $6.00&#13;
Fabric, buttons etc. imported under the regular&#13;
Vallejo Plan drawback scheme; fabric cut and&#13;
garment assembled in Colombia                          $6.00&#13;
Pre-cut fabric, buttons etc. imported under the&#13;
assembly provision of the Vallejo Plan (counter-&#13;
part of 807); garment assembled in Colombia            $1.50 - $3.00a)&#13;
Notes:&#13;
Assumes that fabric and inputs are 50 to 75 percent of the total cost of&#13;
rne pants.&#13;
The one and only difference between the second and third cases in this&#13;
table is that in the second the fabric was cut in Colombia, whereas in the&#13;
third it was cut abroad - yet the value of exports that is listed differs by a&#13;
fhctor of two to four! It is not clear what the ideal solution to this problem is.&#13;
Ope possibility might be to subtract the value of imported inputs from the value of&#13;
n6n-807 Vallejo Plan exports; the aggregate export figures would then approximately&#13;
reflect Colombian direct and indirect value added. (The value of imported petro-&#13;
chemicals, synthetic fibers, yarns, wool etc. used in making Colombian fabric would,&#13;
however, still be included). A second possibility might be to add the value of&#13;
inputs imported but not paid for under 807 (Table 1.13) to the value of 807 exports;&#13;

are not in fact paid for, hence the title non-reimbursable.&#13;

the aggv,h.zdte export figures would then reflect gross value of output in the usual&#13;
sense, regardless of whether inputs were produced domestically or abroad. These two&#13;
.1djust1in.i1ts are attempted in Table 1.14.  Given the crudity of the assumptions&#13;
needed to generate the adjusted numbers, and given that the trends that they&#13;
demonstrate do not differ significantly from those discussed earlier, a third&#13;
option will bc followed hereinafter: recognize the problem, bear it in mind&#13;
throughout, but continue to use the original, unadjusted data.&#13;
UNREGISTERED EXPORTS&#13;
The earlier discussion of fictitious exports was concerned with foreign&#13;
sales that were registered but never took place. A mirror-image problem arises&#13;
with exports that are never registered but do take place. A Colombian firm&#13;
that wants to receive the export subsidy for selling garments to Venezuelans&#13;
h*   o sell its goods in the Mlargarita Islands.  If the firm is willing to for-&#13;
go the CAT, however, it can take the alternative route of selling to merchants&#13;
in Cucuta and Maicao, whence the goods find their own way across the border.&#13;
One reason that an expiorter might be willing to forgo the CAT is that prices&#13;
in Cucuta and Maicao tend to be somewhat higher than in the Islands, because&#13;
the markets in these two towns are even less competitive than the Islands' mar-&#13;
ket.  In addition, a firm selling to a Colombian town can avoid dealing with&#13;
the export-related bureaucracy. This is likely to be a particularly important&#13;
consideration for firms that specialize in a variety of shady activities, but&#13;
even fully legitimate enterprises, particularly smaller ones, may place some&#13;
value on the administrative and psychic costs so saved.&#13;
There are no hard data on the value of Colombian clothing that passes&#13;
through Cucuta and Maicao to Venezuela. On the basis of information collected&#13;

during the interviews, however, it seems that unreg-stered exports following&#13;
this route were probably at least as great as registered exports to thle&#13;
Islands in 1977 ($23 million), and possibly considerably g)Dater. 1)  Thlc&#13;
border town of Ipiales serves as a comparable focal point for unregistcred&#13;
exports tc Ecuador but these seem to be much less significant in volume.&#13;
If the absolute size of unregistered exports is not knowable, can&#13;
anything be deduced about their likely t--nd over time?   Thie volume of&#13;
unregistered exports is likely to be: (a) positively related to per capita&#13;
incomes in Venezuela and Ecuador; (b) inversely' related to,the value of&#13;
the CAT; (c) positively related to the differential bettween the black market&#13;
and official exchange rates; and (d) sensitive to institutioral clhanges.&#13;
Per capita incomes in Colombia's two oil-rich neighbors have increased&#13;
eificantly since 1973; the CAT received by clothing exporters has been&#13;
raised twice since 1975; the black market cxchange rate differential has&#13;
switched from positive to negative since 1975; and a numnber of thle new&#13;
traders who appeared in the Margarita Islands after the Islands were granted&#13;
free port status in 1975 previously operated in Maicao and took their trade&#13;
with them. The first of these four considerations suggests that unregistered&#13;
exports are likely to have increased in volume since 1974-7S; the last three&#13;
suggest the reverse.  Unfortuna.ely, therefore, there is no way of knowing&#13;
with any degree of certainty what the net trend has been.&#13;
1.  One informant suggested off-the-cuff that they may he twicc as great.   One&#13;
firm in our sample that had almost ceased exporting to the United S1:ites&#13;
and the Islands sold goods valued at half a million dollars (half of its&#13;
total value of production) to Cuicuta in 1977. A second firm sent 40&#13;
percent of its output to CuIcuta, twice as much as to the Islands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
At the same time as an increase in the CAT makes it less likely that&#13;
Colombian firms will smuggle their export goods across borders, it also in-&#13;
creases the incentive for legal exporters to overinvoice their foreign sales.&#13;
The existence of taxes on corporate profits, on the other hand, gives firms&#13;
an incentive to underinvoice their exports. (Such taxes, and hence this in-&#13;
centive, have remained constant since 1975). Not surprisingly, no estimates&#13;
of the overall magnitude of over- or under-invoicing are available. Flowever,&#13;
two interviewees suggested that, to the extent that over-invoicing .kes take&#13;
place, it is likely to be restricted to the Venezuelan and Caribbean markets,&#13;
since it is likely to be less risky to invoice falsely there than for sales&#13;
to the United States and Europe.&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
The statistics are terrible. )Yet despite their many deficiencies    and&#13;
after allowing for all the unknowns, one clear and important conclusion shines&#13;
through. Colombia's clothing exports to the UJnited States, Europe, Venezuela&#13;
and the Caribbean all increased impressively from 1970 to 1974 or 1975; after&#13;
that, exports to Venezuela and the Caribbean, which have more in common with&#13;
domestic sales than with exports to the United States, continued to grow, while&#13;
exports to United States and Europe declined significantly through 1977 and&#13;
then levelled out or recovered slightly.   The task in the next two chapters is&#13;
to explain the rise, the fall, and the levelling oLt or slight recovery in&#13;
Colombia's exports to the difficult markets.&#13;
1.  Needless to say, this is not the fault of the agencies that collect and&#13;
publish them.&#13;

EXCHANGE RATE AN) EXPORT INCENTIVE POLICIES&#13;
Our busincss isn't really making shirts, it is making&#13;
money.  In the years that we could makc moncy on exporting&#13;
shirts, wc were happy to do it.  But now that cxports alc&#13;
no longer profitablc  we of course sell the shirts here&#13;
in Colombia.&#13;
-Colombian shirt manufacturer&#13;
The most important singlc reason why Colombia's exports of clothing&#13;
to the lnlited States and Furope began to grow rapidly after 1970 is that&#13;
the government's exchanlge rate and cxport inlccnltive policies had begun&#13;
to make them profitable. The reasons why thcse exports subsequently&#13;
declined are rather more complex, but the de facto reversal of thcsc&#13;
exchange rate policies appears at lcast to have been a contributing factor.&#13;
The dollar prices that Colombian clothing firms receivc for exporting&#13;
garments to the world markets are determined by aggregate supply and&#13;
demand in those markets and are outside Colombia's control.  Thc main&#13;
variables relating to the profitability of exports that Colombian&#13;
governments and producers are able to affect are the number of pesos received&#13;
per dollar of exports, on the one hand, and costs of production, on the&#13;
other.  The analysis in this chapter focusses on thc number of pesos&#13;
received per dollar of exports; costs of production are examined in detail&#13;
in Chapter 5.&#13;

In 1967, a year of foreign exchangc crisis, President Carlos lleras&#13;
Restrepo cngincered a fundamental shift in the emphasis of Colombia's&#13;
foreign trade strategy awaly from import substitutiotn and towards export&#13;
promotion.  Decree Law 444   passed in that year  began a policy of&#13;
devaluing the peso frequeitilv  more or less in step* with inflation.  It also&#13;
replaced the cxisting fiscal export incentive of Law 81 with the more&#13;
generally usable and neater CAT, revamped and sinmplified the Vallejo Plan&#13;
drawback schemc, and set ul the export promotion agency PROrXPO. ) In&#13;
1973, PROEXPO began to grant credit to cxporters at below market inteiest&#13;
rates.  This credit is available for ul) to SO percent of the value of&#13;
exports  or for 80 percent of the direct domestic content of cxports if&#13;
the Vallejo Plan is used.   The rate of intercst charged on PROLXPO credit&#13;
was reduced from 1S to 13 lpercent in 1977, whilc the differential between&#13;
the market rate of interest and the PROEXIO rate ilcreased from two percentage&#13;
points in 1973 to fourteen percentage points in 1978.    lrhc CAT was reducedc&#13;
sharply in value and was differentiated by product in 1975; it was then&#13;
increased in value for certain items in 1977 and 1)78. From 1974 onwards,&#13;
the CAT for Vallejo Plan exports has been paid only onl direct domestic&#13;
content.  All of thc measures described in this Paragraph and some other&#13;
related data are summarized in Table 2.1.&#13;
To estimate quantitatively the aggregate impact that the various&#13;
changes in export incentives have had on the profitalility of exporting,&#13;

over time,  it is necessary first to bring thesc incenitives to a singlc&#13;
common denominator.  Thiis is done in Table 2.2. wlich presents the vallc&#13;
of the effcctive subsidies implicit in the CAT, PROEMXO credlit  and the&#13;
Vallejo Plan as percentages of the valuc of export sales duling 19)(7-79.&#13;
(The formulas used to calculatc these effective values are derived and&#13;
presented in Appendix B.)   For a clothinlg exportcr who dlid not UsC the&#13;
Vallejo Plan, the total effective subsidy implicit in the CAI and PROL\PO&#13;
credit rose gradually during 1967-7t, fell sharply with the reductioni of&#13;
the CAT in 1975, and theln increased again througlh 197S.  For firms using&#13;
the Vallejo Plan, the total effective subsidy fluctuated slightly around&#13;
a conistantit trend during 1967-72, declined during 1973-75l) and recovered&#13;
slightly during 1977-78.&#13;
Manipulation of export incentives was1 only one way in which the govern-&#13;
ment influenced the net number of pesos received per dollar of exports&#13;
after 1967; exchange rate policcy was Import ant too. 'I'hC rate at %%hichd&#13;
the government devalued tlle peso durii g 190- -78 can he seen from the series&#13;
for the nominal exchange rate in Table 2.l. The rate of devalLuation, of&#13;
course, means little in isolation from movements in relative prices.   The&#13;
real exchange rate, also in Table 2.;, brings these two aspects together:&#13;
it is computed by multiplying the nominal exchange rate hy the ratlo of&#13;
U.S. to Colombian prices.2)  The comDained effects of devaluatlon and export&#13;
1. '[he elimination of prior deposits was an important facto. in this decline -&#13;
which serves to illustrate that the "subsidy" calculated for firms using&#13;
the Vallejo Plan is a rather different aninmal from the more convenitional&#13;
subsidy computed for firms not usinig that plan.&#13;
2.  IJ.S. prices are used in thcse comlputltions ratlher than pirices in a hasket&#13;
of countries because by far the greatest part of Colombia's exports of&#13;
clothing to difficult markets go to the Unii ted States.&#13;

incentive policies are reflected in the cffective exchangc rate, the next&#13;
to appear in Table 2.3; this is computed by mutltiplyinig thc nominal cxchanlgc&#13;
rate by (1 + s) where s, taken from Table 2.2. i; the total effective&#13;
subsidy to clotlling exports.  Finally, all of the above influences - the&#13;
rate of devaluation, the rates of increase of prices in Colombia and the&#13;
United States, and the effective value of export incentives - are brouglht&#13;
together in a single summary measure, the real effective exchange rate.1)&#13;
Despite its apparent complexity, the real effective exchange rate has&#13;
a simple and powerful intuitive interpretation.   Take a limited liability&#13;
companiy - 70 percent of the firms interviewed in this study were of this&#13;
type - that does not use the Vallejo Plan. If-it sells a garment abroad,&#13;
the total number of pesos that it receives (p x) will depend upon the&#13;
price of the garment in dollars (p$), the nominal exchange rate (R) and the&#13;
total effective subsidy (s) that it receives from the CAT and PROEXPO&#13;
credit.  Thlat is:&#13;
p  = Ps .     (1 + s)                              (2.1)&#13;
If it sells the same garment in the domestic .Colombian market, it&#13;
will receive a price in pesos (Pd)    The ratio of these two prices is:&#13;
px = p$  . R . (1 + s)                            (2.2)&#13;
But equation 2.2 is nothing but the formula for the real effective exchange ratc.&#13;
Thus, changes over time in the real effective exchange rate as it is computed&#13;
here measure changes over time in the relative profitability of exporting and&#13;
1. This is also known as the purchasing-p)ower-parity-adjusted effective&#13;
exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
selling doffiestically.   A rise in the real effective exchange rate means&#13;
that exporting has increased in profitability relative to selling domesti-&#13;
cally; a fall indicates the reverse.&#13;
Table 2.3 presents two separate sets of estimates for the real effcc-&#13;
';tive exchange rate. One set uses wholesale clothing prices as the deflator,&#13;
the other uses general consumer prices.    For the present purposes, the&#13;
first set is the more relevant; the second is presented mainlv as&#13;
a check on whetlher the trend of the real effective exchange rate for&#13;
clothing seems to be particular to that industry.)&#13;
.  It is assumed that the ratio of the cost of producing a good for export&#13;
to the cost of producing the same good for domestic sale remains constant&#13;
over time.&#13;
2.  It would hiave been desirable to use general whiolesale prices rather than&#13;
general consumer prices in the second set of estimates.    Unforttnately,&#13;
however, the Colombian wlholesale price index includes, and gives quite&#13;
a heavy' weight to, the price of coffee. The sharp rise in the price&#13;
of coffee that occurred during 1976--7 did not, directly' and of itself,&#13;
increase the returns to selling manufactured goods domestically in&#13;
those years - yet the inclusion of coffee in the wholesale price index&#13;
makes this seem to be the case. If, ignoring this defect, the wholesale&#13;
price index were used in computing the real effective exchange rate,&#13;
the arguments that follow in the text would be further strengthened.&#13;
Another alternative real effective exchange rate might use a cost-&#13;
of-inputs price index as the deflator. Suclh an index might include,&#13;
for instance, the price of fabric, the prices of other inputs, and the&#13;
cost of employing labor. Even if time series data were available to&#13;
construct this index - they are not - it would need to be compared,&#13;
presumably, with similar indexes in other clothlinlg exporting countries&#13;
rather than withl a similar index for the United States. FEDESARROLLO&#13;
(1979) computes a real effective exchange rate at an aggregate level&#13;
for all industry using a crude cost-of-inputs price index; it shows the&#13;
same general trends as the real effective exchange rntes used here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- S4 -&#13;
Wlhichever of thc two sets of real effective exchange rates is used,&#13;
the pattern of variation during 1967-78 is _lcar.   From 19(67 until 1970-72,&#13;
the profitability of exlportinig clothing relativc to sclling it at. home&#13;
rose steadily; from abiout 1973 onwards, thc rclative profitability of&#13;
exporting began to declinc.   In the case of tihc real effectivc exchange&#13;
rate deflated by general consumier prices, h! 1978 the rclative profitability&#13;
of exporting had retiurincd to wha-it it was in the crisis year of 1967.  For&#13;
the index deflated by wholesale clothiing prices bhy 1978 tile relative&#13;
profitability of exporting was IS percent below wlhalt it had been in 1967.&#13;
This summary is applicable to thc case of a liimited liability company thiat&#13;
does not use the Vallejo Plan; for public companies, and for all comlpani es&#13;
using the Vallejo Plan, the deterioration in the relative profitability of&#13;
exporting by 1978 was even greater.   Thre relative and absolute decline in&#13;
Ithie profitability of cxporting will be examined in more detail in thc&#13;
discussion of costs and effective lrotection in Chapiter 5 below.1&#13;
1. The fact that the U.S. wholesale clothing pricc index understates tile&#13;
true rise in IJ.S. clothing prices during 1970-78 meanin s that tihe post&#13;
1972 decline i.n the real effectivc exchalnge rate weighted by wholesaile&#13;

however: (a) most companies exporting garmeints to the United States&#13;
do in fact use the Vallejo Plani; as noted above, for tilem, otiler&#13;
things equal, the decline in the real effective exchanige rate was&#13;
significantly greater than that descrihbd     in thc text; zlid&#13;
(b) the gencral pattern of risc and declinic appears also in the&#13;
real effective exchange rate weighited bv ceneral constiuimer prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The basic cause of the post-1972 decline in thc real effective&#13;
exchange rate was simple: the government did not devalue the peso fast&#13;
enough. True, the reduction in the CAT during 1975 contributed signifi-&#13;
cantly to the decline in that year - but 1975 was the only year during&#13;
1967-78 that the total effective subsidy to clothing exports fell.1)&#13;
In every other year, the real effective exchange rate declined wholly and&#13;
solely because the rate of devaluation was not rapid enough to compensate&#13;
for the fact that prices in Colombia were rising faster than prices in the&#13;
United States.&#13;
As a'first step in examining the consequences of the variations that&#13;
took place in the real effective exchange rate during 1967-78, the&#13;
W0thi.ng-price and consumer-price versions of this variable are plotted&#13;
in Fig. 2.1, together with data on U.S. imports of clothing from Colombia.2)&#13;
At first glance, the graph indicates, in an apparent paradox, that the years in&#13;
1.. This statement refers to limited liability companies not using the&#13;
Vallejo Plan - see Table 2.2.&#13;
2.   Exports to the United States are used in the following analysis&#13;
because these are Colombia's main clothing exports to a difficult&#13;
market  and because the data problems are least with these exports.&#13;
The series of U.S. clothing imports from Colombia is used' rather than&#13;
the series of Colombia's clothing exports to the United States because&#13;
it is available for a greater number of years.   WVhichever of the two&#13;
series is used, the results are essentially the samc.&#13;

which the real ecfective exchange rate for clothing fell    most rapidly,&#13;
1973-75, were also the years in wihich clothing exports to the United States&#13;
rose most rapidly.   Once allowdnce is made for lags, however, thle data tell&#13;
a ratlher differenit story.&#13;
Before 1967, Colombian governments tended to tackle balance of payments&#13;
problems by carrying out a jump devaluation, waiting until inflation had&#13;
enoded away its beneficial effects, and then jump devaluing again.     As a&#13;
consequence, between 1953 and 1907 there were nov., more tnan two consecu-&#13;
tive nears in whlich the real effective exchangc   - r:e ioved in "he same&#13;
direction!   (Table 2.4).  The effects of such instability on potential&#13;
exporters are not difficult to imagine.    If an entrepreneur cannot be&#13;
sure of the returns that he is likely to receive from exports even a&#13;
ar or two From now, he is hardly likely to make long range export nlans,&#13;
Winvest large sums in new plant and equipment, or to risk hirinig&#13;
diffictult-to-fire workers.&#13;
As is clear from Table 2.1, the situation changed dramatically in&#13;
1967. From this date on, for the first time in over a quarter of a&#13;
century, the relative profitability of exporting rose continuously, or&#13;
at least did not fall, for six consecutive years.    Not surprisingly, it&#13;
sciems to have taken some time l,fore the export pessimism that was as&#13;
common in Colombia as in most of Latin America could be overcome.     it&#13;
took time until entrepreneurs began to believe that exporting goods&#13;
other than cof£ee and petroleum might be feasible arid profitable -&#13;
Colomoia's total exports of all manufactured goods were only $44 million&#13;
in 1967, less than. exports of clothing alone a decade later - and that&#13;
this profitability might be maintained for more than just a year or two.&#13;
It took further time until plant, equipmcr't, and labor force&#13;

could be adapted or retrained to fulfill the stringent requirements of&#13;
export markets., And it took time until buyers could be found, orders&#13;
placed, goods produced, and an export momentum built up.&#13;
Clearly, the sum of these lags will have been of differenlt length for&#13;
each individual firm. Nevertheless, it is notable that, of the 20 firms in&#13;
the sample that were established before 1967, only one began exporting before&#13;
the policy reforms took place, whereas thirteen (two-thirds) made their first&#13;
small foreign sales during 1968-71 (Table 2.5). At the aggregate level,&#13;
although clothing exports began to increase from 1968 onwards, it was not&#13;
until 1970 that they first exceeded $1 million.&#13;
The lags seem also to hiave been operating for changes in the reverse&#13;
direction. WVhen, after six consecutive years of improvement, the real&#13;
-effective exchange rate began to decline in 1973, it appears to have&#13;
taken some time until entrepreneurs who were exporting    or gearing ul)&#13;
for export  began to believe that the decreased profitability of selling&#13;
abroad was likely to be a long-term, rather than a temporary, phenomenon.&#13;
Many of them had begun to think of exports as the wave of the future -&#13;
government pronouncements, as opposed to policies, continue to this day&#13;
to encourage them to believe this - and w.ere planning output, investment,&#13;
and hiring policies accordingly. A number of firms had set up export&#13;
departments at considerable expense.   Some businessmeni had had a taste of&#13;
the unit costs that could be cut   and the profits that could be made   by&#13;
specializing and doing long production runs for the U.S. market.    (Tne eyes&#13;
of one former exporter of jeans to the United States lit up during our&#13;

when exporting was profitable).   A few firms had painstakingly built up&#13;
relationships with U.S. and Luropean buyers and were reluctant to lose&#13;
them to competitors in other countries.   It is not surprising, then, that&#13;
as the relative and absolute profitability of exporting began to decline,&#13;
the first reaction of many firms was to cut costs, attempt to increase&#13;
efficiency and continue to expand exports as before rather than to abandon&#13;
the new, exciting export optimism overnight.   In what wias probably a coincidence,&#13;
the amount of time that passed before the break in the trend of the real&#13;
effective exchange rate caused a change in the trend of clothing exports&#13;
was again two or three years.   lhe real effective exchange rate began to&#13;
decline in 1973; clothing exports to the United States began to decline in&#13;
rcal terms in 1975 ur 1976.1)&#13;
'rhe existence of this three-year lag can be tested for statistically.&#13;
In the following regressions, U.S. imports of clothing from Colombia in&#13;
constant p,rices (XCON) or in square yard e(luivalents (XSYE) are estimated&#13;
as a function of the real effective exchange rate of three years earlier&#13;
(REER_3) and of total U.S. imports of clothing in constant prices (M).&#13;
This last variable is included because the slharp increase in U.S. demand&#13;
for clothing imports after the mid 1960's no doubt played a role in the&#13;
expansion of Colombia's clothing exports to that country.2)   In equations&#13;
2.3 and 2.5, the real effective cxchange rate is deflated by uholesale&#13;
clothing prices; in equations 2.4 4'?d 2.6, it is deflated by general consumer&#13;
prices (Table 2.6).&#13;
1.  The constant price data showq this decline beginning in 1976; the square&#13;
yard equivalent data show it beginning in 1975.   After being pushed out&#13;
of the U.S. market some firms gave ulp exporting altogetlher; others&#13;
switched to the easier markets of the Margarita Islantds and the&#13;
Caribbean where they were still able to compete.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The regression results are consistcnt with the hypothesis tl.It thc&#13;
rise and fall of the real effective exchange rate has played an important&#13;
role in the rise and decline of Colombia's cxports of clothing to the&#13;
United States. ) Taken at face valuc, the coefficient estimates suggest&#13;
that an increase of onc percent in the real effectivc exchanige rate led&#13;
to an increase, three years later, of between 8 and 20 pcrcent in thc volume&#13;
of these exports.   hlowever, I would place no reliance at all on the precise&#13;
magnitudes estimated here.   To begin with, the data are problematical, and&#13;
only nine ycars of figures arc availahle. In addition, it ma)' well be&#13;
largely coincidence that the tu.o lags   the one betwoecn the 1967 policy&#13;
changes and the surge In cexports, .nd the onc het.eeln the dosi,uturn In the&#13;
real effective exchanige rate and the decline in exports - were c.wch of ahout&#13;
three years in length. 2) Finally, the decline in the real effective exchange&#13;
rate was by no means the only cause of the post 1974-75 fall in Colombia's&#13;
clothing exports. The boom in the domestic demand for apparel that was caused&#13;
by high coffee prices and increased exports of drugs3) and exacerbated by high&#13;
protection against imports of garments caused selling domestically to become&#13;
increasingly morc profitable than exporting to the United States. Indeed,&#13;
as a result of the domestic boom, even some firms that woul1 still have&#13;
1.  Others who have founld that the real effective exchange rate hais an&#13;
important impact on minor cxports in Colombia - all exports other than&#13;
coffee and petroleum - include Sheahan and Clark (1967), Ulrdinola and&#13;
Mallon (1967), Musalem (1970), Nelson, Schultz and Slighton (1971),&#13;
Eaton (19!72), Tcigeiro and [I son (1'73) ,  (a: .--Al ejaudro (1I' id , .uid&#13;

3. According to conservative estimates, Colombhia's exports of m       tu:1;&#13;
and cocaine earned about $6SO millionl in 1978 (Junguito and Caba:1lle-ro&#13;
197g).  less cautIous observers supgest that the two drugs may have&#13;
surpassed coffee (exports of which earned $2 billion in 1978) as the&#13;
country's foremost source of foreigni e\bdnge.&#13;

been able to export to the United States at a profit switched to selling&#13;
almost all of their output in thie hlome market. )  The high and uisinig cost&#13;
of fabric, made possible by stiff protection against textile imports,&#13;
accentuated the squeeze on the returns to exporting.    An.l several&#13;
non-price factors were also important causes of the decline. (These non-&#13;
price factors, effective protection and a number of other omitted factors,&#13;
will be analyzed in detail in Part 2.) The omission of thlese important&#13;
variables no doubt causes the coefficient of the real effective exchange&#13;
rate that is estimated in thle above equations to be biased; the bias is&#13;
probably upwards.2)&#13;
WVhv is it that the rate of dcvala:tion of the peso was not rapid&#13;
enough after the early 1970's to maintain constancy of the real effective&#13;
exchange rate?   At least since 1976, Colombia has been confronted with a&#13;
dilemma similar to that faced by many other nations that are heavily&#13;
dependent on natural resource based exports as sources of foreign exchange.&#13;
When the price of the major export product rises sharply, should the&#13;
national currency be allowed to rise in value so ats to maintain balance of&#13;
payments equilibrium and netutralize the inflationary pressures that would&#13;
otherwise be generated, in which case exporters of manufactures are likely&#13;
1.  One suchi is a firm wliichi specializes in fashion clothiilg for middle-&#13;
aged women   and is owned by onc of the few Colombians who is said to&#13;
be up to thie minute ,ith the latest in world clothing trends.    During&#13;
tlhe mid 1970's this firm was exporting 80 percent of its outPlut to&#13;
the United States   and counted Bloomin,gdales and several other hiigh&#13;
class establislhmenlts among its clients.  By 1977, the lure of thle&#13;
domestic market had become too greait; the owner completol ' revised&#13;
hIis plans in that year, anid the company nol% se ils )o p(, icrlct of its&#13;
output at homiie.&#13;
2. The fact that the constant term is strongly and significantly negative&#13;
in all four equations is consistent with this hypothesis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
to bc priced out of thcir markets; or should the rate of devaluation continue&#13;
to compensatc for the inflation differential, in which case a balance of&#13;
paymcnts surplus is likely to accumulate and inflationary pressures are&#13;
likely to rise? lYhen stated in this form, the dilemma seems serious indeed -&#13;
yet these two possibilities do not exhaust the field. In particular,&#13;
whereas the Colombians chose the former option, a third possible response&#13;
to the 1976 increase in coffee prices was also available: continue to&#13;
devalue at the inflation-differential rate, at the same time pushing ahead&#13;
with the progressive liberalization of imports. Such a policy would have&#13;
yielded benefits on several fronts. Balance of payments surpluses would&#13;
have been avoided. The differential between the incentive to produce for&#13;
-fhe home market and thc incentive to export would have been narrowed1)&#13;
and firms would have been forced to become more efficient generally. The&#13;
absolute level of competitiveness of manufactured exports in foreign&#13;
markets would have been maintained. And inflationary pressures in the&#13;
economy due to the risc in the price of coffee would have been moderated.&#13;
Thus, although there were strong macroeconomic reasons why Colombian&#13;
governments began to devalue the peso more slowly, this course was certainly&#13;
not the only one that was available.&#13;
Finally, what explanation can be given for the levelling off or&#13;
slight recovery of Colombia's clothing exports to the United States that&#13;
occurred durinig 1978-79? First of all, it ought to be noted that such&#13;
recovery as did occur was extremely modest - in real terms, the after-the-&#13;
fall annual rate of 1976 had not yet been regained by the first half of&#13;
1. U.S. pressure on countervailing duties makes it difficult to achieve&#13;
this goal by raising export subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66 -&#13;
1979 (Fig. 1.4 above).   Second, the levelling off or recovery seeins to havC&#13;
rested on the shoulders of a very small group of companies.    In particular,&#13;
three of the firms in the sample accounted for fully half of ColombLa's&#13;
total exports of apparel to the United States in 1977-7S; thcse were also&#13;
among the relatively few companies we visited that planned to expand their&#13;
sales to the United States in 1979-80.   Apart from being among the four&#13;
or five best managed firms that we saw, each of these three is in a way&#13;
rather special. One is the only firm in the sample that is foreign-owiled:&#13;
it is owned by its U.S. buyer.   A second lhas close ties with a FreilcIh&#13;
designer and, together with this designer, owns ecquity in its U.S. buyer&#13;
and distributor.   The third is the only firm that we visited in whichi the&#13;
U.S. buyer maintains (and covers the cost of) a full-time production cngiineer&#13;
at the plant.  Thus, while the outstanding quality of management has no&#13;
doubt been important in explaining the continued ability of these three&#13;
firms to export to the United States, the unusually close relationships&#13;
between the firms and their buyers is important in understanding their&#13;
continued willingness to export to the United States at a time when other&#13;
markets, domestic and neighboring, appear to be considerably more profitable.&#13;
rhird, most of the firms still exporting to the United States seem to&#13;
realize that, if you want to succeed in exporting to difficult markets&#13;
in the long term:&#13;
You  have to sell when pr'         ui,favorable as ieII as %dihn the!&#13;
are favorable.   It is impos-   e     try to participate in one of&#13;
these markets [the United Statc. or Europe] only whIIen tlhe conditions&#13;
are advantageous... Any interruption means no less thanl that all&#13;
the efforts that have been expended wvill be lost (Escobar, 1977, p.22).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
Finally, most of the firms still selling to the United States export a&#13;
relatively sniall fraction of their total output. Thus, among the thirteen&#13;
firms in the sample for wvhich the United States is the main export market&#13;
(these thirteen accounted for 75 percent of Colombia's total exports of&#13;
garments to the United States in 1977-78), nine exported 20 percent or&#13;
less of their total production in 1977-78 and only two exported more than&#13;
50 percent.  This means that most are able to continue to supply their&#13;
U.S. buyers, at least for the time being, iithout making too much of a&#13;
dent in their total profits.&#13;
In summary, the conclusions that can be dra%,n from the analysis in&#13;
this chapter are as follows. The rise in Colombia's clothing exports&#13;
during 1970-74/75 seems to be largely attributable to the unprecedented&#13;
six-year rise in the real effective exchange rate (that is, in the relative&#13;
P nd absolute profitability of exporting) that began when a series of&#13;
policy reforms were introduced in 1967. The fall in Colombia's clothing&#13;
exports to the United States, which began in 1975 or 1976, seems to have&#13;
been due partly to the subsequent decline in the real effective exchange&#13;
rate and partly to other price and non-price factors that have yet to be&#13;
discussed in detail. And the levelling off or slight recovery in garment exports&#13;
to the UJnited States that occurred during 1978-79 appears to be attribu-&#13;
table mainly to the fact that a small number of firms, several of them&#13;
having quite special links with their U.S. buyers, were clinging to&#13;
their foothold in the U.S. market for as long as possible in the hope that&#13;
the profitability of selling in the United States would increase in the&#13;
future.&#13;

SOMIE NON-PRICE FACTORS&#13;
Although the exchange rate and export incentive policies pursued by&#13;
successive Colombian governments seem to have been an important cause of&#13;
the rise and decline of Colombia's exports of clothing to the United States&#13;
and Europe, non-price factors played some part as well.    This chapter&#13;
examines the role of U.S. buyers, foreign brand name agreements and small&#13;
firms in getting exports off the ground after 1970. The analysis of the&#13;
role played by non-price factors in halting and reversing this rise is&#13;
postponed, for convenience of presentation, until Chapter 6.&#13;
l1.S. BUYERS&#13;
In the richer, industrialized countries, especially with respect to&#13;
imports, the role of the buyer in the clothing industry is great. When&#13;
Colombian firms export clothing to the United States and Europe, it is&#13;
almost always the foreign huycr who sets the detailed specifications for&#13;
the product, who physically imports the good, and whlo arranges for its&#13;
wholesale or retail distribution. In some cases, the buyer also helps the&#13;
Colombian manager in purchasing fabric and other inputs - this is true, of&#13;
course, for all exports made under the 807 offshore assembly scheme - and&#13;
in the day-to-day running of the factorv.&#13;
A few years before Colombia began to reorient its trade policies&#13;
towards export promotion, a number of other developing countries, especially&#13;
several in East Asia, took similar steps with a great deal of success.&#13;
As a result, by the late 1960's and early 1970's, U.S. and European clothing&#13;
manufacturers, wlholesalers and retailers realized that they would have to&#13;
increase their imports of clothiilg from developing countries if they were&#13;
to stay in business and began to.rove the world in search of new sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Most of tile SCOutinlg Was then concentrated in ilong Kong, Korea and Taiwan&#13;
but a numb.or of seekers found their way to Colombia as wecll  The arrival&#13;
of these buyers helped great]y to break the stiff maLrketing barriers that&#13;
face any potential newv entrant into garment exporting.&#13;
FOREIGN BkAND NAMES&#13;
At about the same time as foreign buyers were beginining to appear in&#13;
Colombia, a second, related phenomenoni was taking place: Colombian firms&#13;
increasingly began to purchase the licenses to use foreign brand names and&#13;
trademarks.  By 1978, Levy's, Blue Bell (Wrangler), Lee and Landlubber all&#13;
hlazd licensees in Colombia, as did Manhattan, P\rrow, Van lleusen, Bobby&#13;
ilrooks, 1VD, Jock3 e  Pierre Card in and Yves St. Laurent )&#13;
'CalC of the attractionis to Colombian firms of buying the license to&#13;
use a foreign trademark is, of course. that products branded with an&#13;
internationally-known name can be sold at a highier price thani similar&#13;
garments bearing a label that is less well Lknown.  The maliager of one&#13;
Colombian firm was good enloughi to let me halve some hard information on this&#13;
subject.  Thlis firm produces two versions of one of its paiirs of pants that&#13;
are identical in every respect - except that one bears the firm's domestic&#13;
laibel whereas the other carries an international lv-famous name. The firm&#13;
sells both these versions rather than concentrating only on the higlher-&#13;
priced one because, the manager explained, in this way it is possible to&#13;
tap both the upper- and the middle-income markets.   l3oth pairs of pants&#13;
arc sold in the Margarita Islands; because this market is so marginal in&#13;
world terms, the licensor has been wvilling to turn a blind eye to the use&#13;
of its label for exportinig in this c,sc .  (To protect thle par(nl cP:tpnoy&#13;
1. Some,of these licenses had been acqluired many years earlier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
and parcllel licensees in other countries from identically-branded compe-&#13;
titicn, licensing agreements usually restrict the use of foreign brand&#13;
names to the domestic market.) The prestige-branded version of these&#13;
pants sold for $22.38 in the Islands in late 1978, or 21 percent more than&#13;
that domestic-labelled version. The profit rate (after payment of royalties)&#13;
for the prestige-labelled version was 39 percent of total costs, which is&#13;
40 percent greater than for the Colombian-branded version (Table 3.1,&#13;
Golumns 2 and 3).1)&#13;
Except in the few cases in %,hichi Colombian fiirins hive becn perniitted&#13;
to export garments using a foreign brand name, the above-illustrated&#13;
benefit from licensing agreements clearly accrues only to the private&#13;
producer.  If there were no other benefits to be obtained from suchl agree-&#13;
ments, the considerable royalty payments involved - from 2 to 15 percent&#13;
of sales, depending on the namc - would make them a poor investmenit for&#13;
*se country.    But thlere exist in addition two benefits from the purchase&#13;
of foreigni trademarks whiclh are of social as well as private value  and&#13;
which may havc played somc part in helpinlg Colombiia's clothing exports&#13;
get off the ground in the carly and mid 1970's.)&#13;
Clothing produccrs who wish to export garments to worlc markets have&#13;
little clhanice of breaking into the market  if they arc not reasonably up&#13;
tp date with %%orld fashion trends.  One w.ay of keeping up to clate might hc&#13;

above)&#13;
A t.iird option, the onlv r..1 one olpen to a large nuLmber of small and&#13;
medium-sized Colombian firms, is to sign a licensing agreement.     As part of&#13;
most licensing agreements in the apparel businiess, the licensor agrees to&#13;
supply the licerisce with fashion informaztion that is relevant to its line&#13;
of. business.  The precise form in which the information that is supplied&#13;
varies widel)   from in-house fashion magazines to ready-to-use patternis and&#13;
molds; but tble valuc of this information in raising the fashion-awareness&#13;
of local firms   and hence their ability to export wl.en exporting is profit-&#13;
able  is indisptutable.)-&#13;
In addition to supplying fashlion information, licensing agreements&#13;
have further helped Colombian clothing firms to begin exporting by providing&#13;
technical assistance.   Again, the precise form which this assistance tales&#13;
hals varied widely.  Some foreign firms have carried out time and motion&#13;
studies in their liconsees' plants   and have recommended ways in which&#13;
the flow of production miglht be reorganized. Others have made suggestions&#13;
concerning technliques of cutting fabric, machine maintenance schedules,&#13;
methods of sewing, and the use of new improved materials (collar stays,&#13;
lininjgs) or nerw improved material-joi ning methods (fusion instead of sewing).&#13;
1.  The increase in fashion-conisciousness and quality-consciousness among&#13;
Colombian clothing firms has had incidental b)ut signifi cant spillover&#13;
effects for at least a certain segment of Colombian consuniers; the elegant&#13;
Parisian aspect of muclh of the locally-made clotlhing that was displayed in&#13;
shop windows in tlle upper-income areas of Bogota' during 197S contrasted&#13;

SMALL FIRMS&#13;
During a previous stay in Colombia in 1970-71, 1 interviewed the&#13;
managers of several clothinlg firms for another project. It appeared then&#13;
that muclh of the apparel produiced by these companies was competitive in&#13;
world terms in both price and quality2)- yet the firms were not able to&#13;
1. The Marlboro affair is a case in point.    Several years ago the Colombian&#13;
government issued a permit to the Philip Morris Company to start p,rodulcing&#13;
Marlboro cigarettes in Colombia using locally-grown tobacco.   The firm&#13;
began by mounting a massive advertising campaign   and soon captured a&#13;
substantial share of the market.   But more than half (some say 9(0 percent)&#13;
of the Marlboro cigarettes that have been sold in Colombia in recent&#13;
years were not made in Colombia; rather, they were made in tlbs United&#13;
States and smuggled into the country. The reason, apparentl',, is that&#13;
Colombian smokers of Marlboro prefer Virginia tobacco to the darker&#13;
locally-grown variety. ln late 1978, voI rarely had to walk more than&#13;
a few blocks in the downtown area of any of the main cities in Colombia&#13;
before coming upon someone crying    "Marlboro, Marlboro!'  This person&#13;
invariably carried only the smuggled cigarettes, in their original&#13;
pack!ts, with 'Made in U.S.A.' prinoted clearlv on the l:bel.&#13;
2.  See Mor,wetz (1071). Othels who beli ced that Colombian clothting firms&#13;
were internationally competitive in price and quanity at that time&#13;
inclu(ded Colombian economists who then worked for the National Planning&#13;
Department (DNP, 1971), participants in a World Bank mlssion (Worll Rank,&#13;
1972)  and fellow members of the Harvard Advisory Group) attached to&#13;

export. The reason, apparently, was that they were too small. Either they&#13;
were too small to do the necessary seeking out of markets ); or    if buyers&#13;
visited them - as happened in several cases - they were too small to be&#13;
able to accept the large orders that the buyers wanted to place.    How, if&#13;
at all, were these problems overcome after 1970-71? lWhat role did small&#13;
firms play in the rise of Colombia's clothing exports?&#13;
To the best of my knowledge, no published or unpublished data are&#13;
available on clothing exports by size of firm in Colombia. Nevertheless,&#13;
an indirect but fairly clear idea of the relative importance of small&#13;
firms in these exports can be gained by exami,.ing the sample or clothing&#13;
firms that were interviewed for the present project. These 30 firms&#13;
accounted alone for between half and three quarters of total Colombian&#13;
clothing exports during 1975-78 - the data for 1974 must be discounted&#13;
because of the presence of fictitious exports - and for fully 69 to 90&#13;
percent of exDorts carried out using the Vallejo Plan.    Further, the top&#13;
ten exporters in the sample accounted alone for from 38 to 65 percent of&#13;
total exports and for from 58 to 74 percent of Vallejo Plan exports during&#13;
the same period (Table 3.2). If a small enterprise is defined liberally&#13;
as one with fewer than 100 employees, five small firms were inciuded in&#13;
1.  Tn a study of perceived barriers to exports, Martinez (1973) found that&#13;
in the clothing industry the proportion of small firms reporting&#13;
marketing problems (5S percent) was significantly higher than that of&#13;
l.rge firms (38 percent). Small clothing firms also reported shortages&#13;
of working capital and difficulties with domestic raw materials&#13;
significantly more frequently than large ones. Small firms interested&#13;
in exporting eften suffer from additional handicaps, including&#13;
inadequate management skills, inadequate cost accounting data on which&#13;
to base price quotations, uneveness of product quality, and difficulty&#13;
in obtaining credit; on these and related issues, see de la Torre (1972),&#13;
UNIDO (1972), Van Ruth (1976) and Alexandrides and Mioschis (1977).&#13;

the sample (Table 3.3). None of tlhese five used the Vallejo Plan in the&#13;
years covered here - because of its complexity, the Plan is used mainly&#13;
by large companies - and their combined clothing exports never exceeded&#13;
$1.8 million, or 4 percent of the nation's total, during 1974-78. Clearly,&#13;
then, even if, as is not the case, all clothing exporters that were not&#13;
included in the sample were small, small exporters have played a limited&#13;
role in Colombia's clothing export history.&#13;
Small firms thr.t wish to export have four possible solutions to the&#13;
problems, and especially the marketing problems, that their lack of size&#13;
creates. They can join together with other small firms in a consortium,&#13;
they can export through an intermediary or trading company, they can manti-&#13;
facture goods as subcontractors for a larger exporter, or they can grow&#13;
and themselves become large enterprises. Small firms in Colombia have&#13;
tried all four methods.&#13;
Consortia.&#13;
Between 1970 and 1973, meetings were held to establish export-oriented&#13;
consortia of small and medium-sized clothing firms in Bucaramanga&#13;
(Consexport), Pereira (Conevica), Medellin (Confexcol), Cali (Exporcali),&#13;
and Barranquilla. 1) By 1978, the last of these consortia had failed. The&#13;
Bucaramanga and Pereira groups enjoyed some success for five to seven&#13;

years btit then collapsed;1) the central body set up in Medellin never had&#13;
muclh more than advisory functions; and the Cali and Barranquilla consortia&#13;
never got off the ground.   flow can these failures be explained?&#13;
Any attempt to set up a consortium of small firms for export&#13;
necessarily has to overcome a number of problems. Enterprises and&#13;
especially family enterprises that have competed with each other for&#13;
years and perhaps generations are likely to be reluctant to share hitherto&#13;
secret financial and technical information.    (After all, if the consortium&#13;
should break up, they will once again be rivals). Onco e, sort orders are&#13;
received, which firms should havC priority if, as is likely at least in&#13;
the beginning, there are not enouigh orders to go round?   Since no two&#13;
clothing firms ever produce exactly the same quality garments and since&#13;
strict produIct standardization will have to be established, some firms -&#13;
which ones? - will have to change the way they have traditionally organized&#13;
their production and sewn their garments.   Most difficult of all, oiice&#13;
export orders have bcen received, there is always an incentive for the&#13;
buyer to approach the firm or firms that are pradoicing his particular&#13;
order with the proposal that they work directly for him, thus saving the&#13;
five percent or so commission (more profits for everyone) and saving the&#13;
time and paperwork needed to deal through the consortium as well.&#13;
1.  Consexport was created in 1970 with 18 members, 1600 sewing machines,&#13;
and 2,8(00 workers. In its first year it received an order of $250,000&#13;
to export bikinis to the U.S.; in 1972 it exported $1 million of jean:&#13;
to Denmark; and in 1973 it sent $600,000 of shirts to Italy.    Conevica&#13;
was created in 1972 with 26 members, specialized in men's clothing&#13;
(especially shirts) and exported a total of about $2.5 million dutrilng&#13;
1974-77, almost all to the United States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
The consortium attempts to overcome these very real problems by&#13;
holding otut to its members the prospect of finding them new markets;&#13;
for almost all of the prospective benefits from grouping together small&#13;
firms - lowering of unit production costs, rationalization of production,&#13;
utilization of excess capacity - stem from the potential for increased&#13;
sales.  But finding new foreign markets requires a considerable initial&#13;
investment and a particular kind of expertise, both of which tend to be&#13;
in short supply in small firms even if they are grouped together. This&#13;
leads to a vicious circle. A consortium is usually financed by a surcharge&#13;
on exports; hence, before exports get started, little finance is available.&#13;
But if little finance is available the conisortium is unlikely to be able&#13;
to hire the sort of person or persons who wotuld be good at finding Pnw&#13;
markets.  But if new markets are not found, little finance is available ...&#13;
and so fortl. 1)&#13;
These fundamental realities seem to have been at the heart of the&#13;
collapse of those Colombian consortia that did get off the ground. In&#13;
a word: the central organizing bodies were apparently not able to do well&#13;
enough at finding new markets to convince their members to resist the&#13;
built-in centrifugal forces that any consortium contains.&#13;
Intermediaries&#13;
If small clothing enterprises have not had a greal deal of stucCess In&#13;
exporting through consortia, they have not had much better luck with&#13;
1. I'ROEXPO provided some initial financing for several consortia but&#13;
it was understandably unwilling to act as chief financier on a long-&#13;
term basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
intermediaries. An intermediary is defined here as a tirm whose primary&#13;
business is to arrange for the export of articles produced by other&#13;
firms or people.&#13;
.Thirteen firms which are listed as intermediaries werc registered&#13;
as exporting more than $100,000 of apparel during 19771) - but six of&#13;
these had disappeared by late 1978. ) This illustrates the extent to&#13;
which intermediaries tend to come and go on the Colombian scene: apparently&#13;
it is not a very stable business to be in. In the event, we were able&#13;
to interview five of the thirteen.).&#13;
A solidly-based intermediary might be expected to have a well-organized&#13;
market-scarch system, well-staffed branch offices overseas    and well-&#13;
established relationships with clients and suppliers.    None of the firms&#13;
that we interviewed fits this image.   The most successful operation in&#13;
terms of the volume of exports employs   two people in its market-searching&#13;
department  and is owned and managed by a lawyer who plans to retire in&#13;
three or four years to devote himself to writing law books.    One one-person&#13;
agency is run by a man who sells anything from blouses to fertilizer and&#13;
who uses the business partly as a means of visiting his ex-wife and children&#13;
in the United States. Another is run from a single dark room in a seedy&#13;
1.  Fir c that are listed as intermediaries but which simply market a&#13;
single firm's (or family group's) output are excluded.    Alco excluded&#13;
is the intermediary who acts in the clothing husiness as thc exclusive&#13;
purchasing agent for a single European chain of 5t,res.&#13;
2.  Thcse six firms are prestimed not to have been fictitious   since, as&#13;
noted in Chapter 1, most fictitious exporting of clothing seems to&#13;
have been confined to 1974.&#13;
3.  One more could not be interviewed in the time available    and the&#13;
thirteenth failed to appear at the appointed time.&#13;

Subcont ract i ng&#13;
At Ieast eight of the medium and largc firms that we interviewed&#13;
have subcontracted work oujt to smaller firms at one time or another&#13;
and two of the smaller firms have themselves w.or-ke(d as subcontractors for&#13;
others.    Subcontracting was usually done on a 807 assembly-type basis,&#13;
with the parent firm cutting the fabric and supplying all inputs.   Sub-&#13;
contracting tended to be most common when the parent intended to introduce&#13;
new product lines but had not yet had a chance to set up its own production&#13;
facilities.  It also occurred, however, when demand was irregular and the-&#13;
.parent wished to reduce its riks by avoiding the need to hire workers&#13;
who would later be difficult to fire.   Generally, no more than 25 percent&#13;
or so of the parent's valuie of output was subcontracted out at any one&#13;
time.  None of the firms that stated   that they w.ere participating in&#13;
subcontracting arrangements offered any criticisms of the wvay they&#13;
had worked ouit.&#13;
Growth&#13;
Tf consortia, intermediaries, and suibcontracting arrangemenlts have&#13;
played only modest roles in Colombia's experience vith clothing exports,&#13;
the growth of small firms into large ones seems to have been more impor-&#13;
ant.   Trhough the available data are sketchy, it seems that not one of&#13;
the 25 large firms in the sample started out with as many as one htindred&#13;
employees, and most of them appear to have commenced operations with 40&#13;
1. l)nfortunately, because of lack of time- during the interviews  not all&#13;
firms could he asked about their experience with subcontracting: this&#13;
section is therefore based on partial data only.   In East Asia, sub-&#13;
contracting of work from large firms to small ones seems to he one&#13;
of the more important ways that small   firms are enabled to participate&#13;
in exports.  See, e.g. Watanabe (1971, 1972), Geigers (1973), and&#13;
WortzeIs (197'9a).&#13;
2.  For theoretical arguments and evidence from Denmark, Holland and&#13;
Israel that large firms are likelv to export a larger share of&#13;
their output than small firms, see Hirsch and Adar (1974).&#13;

or fewer.  Tn most cascs, growth sccms to halve taken place gradually over.&#13;
a period of at lcast 1S or 20 years   and to have been financed both from&#13;
rcinvested profits and by borrowing.   There were, nevertheless, a few&#13;
cases of extremeiv rapid growth, one of whichi involv'ed one of the firms&#13;
that had seemed to be too small to accept    large export orders in 1970.&#13;
The total employment of this company grew sevenfold   from 150 in 1970 'o&#13;
over 1,000 in 1978  and its clothiTng exports averaged over $1 million&#13;
a'year during 1974-78.&#13;
Interestingly, only one firm that we interviewed reported having&#13;
received an order that was too large t'or it to handle;' that case endcd in disas-&#13;
tcr   hi episode begin when the relatively large company landed a&#13;
plum contract to supplv 120,000 'ulits a year to the U.S. liccnisee of a&#13;
to) European fashion house.   For reasons that are disputed, the firm&#13;
s    ed only about 60,000 siuits to the  huyer   in the first vear.&#13;
What is more, nciny of the suits that did1 arrive were jiudgeC to be of&#13;
stuch poor qua]lity that they hid to be soldI in discount houses, whiichi allcgedly&#13;
damaged the   ILyer' s  reputation.  Problems contintled durinig the next&#13;
2½ hears, at wlhich time the  b)uy%er  unilaterally abrogated the five-&#13;
yeax contract.  Apparently largely as a resuilt of this one failure, the&#13;
btiy6r   loct its preeminent position in the U.S. market to a Furopean&#13;
rival   and h;is nolt-regained it since.&#13;
Becauise of the glamor attached to the  buyer's   name, the story&#13;
)f this fai lure was written tip in Business Week  and the n,ws spread&#13;
-apidly among the clothing traders of New York.   (Three years later&#13;
.t was still i-eferred to by several of the New York buyers wlhomii I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
interviewed).  As a consequence, at least one othcr Colombian suIt-maker&#13;
and its U.S. importer-manufacturei had to fight a two- to three-year battle&#13;
to convince U.S. retailers to accept their top-quality suits.    According&#13;
to the importer-manufacturer, the first reaction of the retailers was&#13;
usually: "You're offering Colombian-made suits? No.thanks -- they're&#13;
probablv the same shit that the Colombians made for             it With&#13;
commitment and dedication the battle was eventually won bit the moral&#13;
of the story remains: a spectacular failure by one firm can have important&#13;
spillover effects for other firms from the same country that wishl to&#13;
export.1)&#13;
1. This was by no means the only instance in which suJcIh an externality&#13;
occurred; several buyers with t.hom I spoke related bad expericinces&#13;
that they had had with one or two Colombian firms and vowed that&#13;
they would not go back to Colombia.&#13;

did not alhays exist. No more than fifteen years ago, Korea and Taiw.an together&#13;

of all coimiod1 tites amounted to S41 mnilljoii, cft which $S6 mirllionl here manuf'ic-&#13;

at exporting garments than they themselves have been, their first response&#13;
was invariably: we cannot compete with their prices. An illustration&#13;
of the size of the price differential that exists is given by a report&#13;
prepared by PROI-XPO (1977a). In early 1977, this report st,ites, the' price&#13;
that Colombian exporters were offering for both Jeans and men's shirts&#13;
was 44 percent above the Korean price quote, 25 percent above that of&#13;
llong Kong, and 1I percent greater than that of Taiwan.  (The Taiwan figure&#13;
is for shirts only).  At about the same time, Escohat (1977) stated that&#13;
Colombian offering-prices,for a wide range of clothing items werC systematically&#13;
20 to 30 percent above those of the East Asian nations.   rhe impression&#13;
that I gained from the ii.terviews for the present stu(ly is that the price&#13;
gap has not narrowed since 1977; on the contrary, it maNy halve ilacrc'AseOL&#13;

The competitiveness of the prices that the three 1ast Asian&#13;
countries are able to quote and their share of total I1.S. imports&#13;
vary somewhat by type of garment, composition of fabric, antd typical size&#13;
of order (Table 4.3) .2)IHong Kong is dominant in pants and otvther garments&#13;
of cotton and tends to specialize these days in more fashionable,&#13;
higher-pricel articles.   Korea is preeminent in men's 'ihirt.s 1nd&#13;
1. An indirect indication that Colombian prico quiotes are still sy,temiaatically&#13;
higher than those of East Asian garment exporters may he seen from the fact&#13;
that of all the Colombian garment-makers that have bougilt the licence to&#13;
use a foreign brand name, only one is currently alhie to exlort items using&#13;
that brand name to the parent company for distribution in the lUnited States.&#13;
The vast majority of parent companies buy their brand name imnorts in&#13;

Taiwan falls somewhere between the two. Both Korea and Taiwan concentrate par-&#13;
ticularly on articles cf man-made fibers.   Colombia tends to be like Taiwan in&#13;
specializing in goods that are -.either high fashion nor bargain basemcnt. The&#13;
items most often exported bv firms in our Colombia sample were pants and jeans&#13;
(13 firms), blouses and shirts (11), and men's suits, spnrtcoats and iackets&#13;
(5) (Table 4.4).&#13;
The one clothing category in which Colombia has accourted fcr a non-negligible&#13;
share of total U..;. imports is men's woolen suits (Tables 1.10 and 4.3 aLove).&#13;
Suits, incidentally, have ;.    the class of men's apparel in which U.S. imports&#13;
h.re grown most rapidly over the last decade (Table 4.5). Eighteen percent of&#13;
all U.S. imports of men's woolen suits came from Colombia in 1975, more than from&#13;
any other country oxcept Korea and France. Two qualifications need to be added&#13;
to this apparent success story however. First, since 1975, Colon;bi's position&#13;
has been eroded sharply; by 1978, Colombia provided only six percent of the suits&#13;
that uele imported to the United States, and th- number of countries that sur-&#13;
passed or equalled it in market share had ristn from twio to six - France, Korea,&#13;
* Poland, Chile, Hong Kong and Italy.   Seccrc, suits are sold on styling and image&#13;
as much as on price; if they were not, France, which has labor costs far hie,.er&#13;
than those of East Asia, could never have become the number one source of U.S&#13;
imrorts.  Thus it is relevant that over 90 percent of Colombia's exports-of&#13;
suits come from one company which, in addition to being extremely well-manageu,&#13;
has close financial links with a French suit designer-manufacturer; both the&#13;
French and th'e Colcnbian firms, in turn have close financi..l ties to their U.S.&#13;
buyer. Thus, although men's woolen suits do provide an example of the sort of&#13;
success that Colombian garment-exporting firms might he enjoying if thley could&#13;
ovprcome some of their other problems, they do not represent an instance in&#13;
which Colombia has been able to compete successfully with East Asia purely on price.&#13;

Ch'pter S&#13;
COSTS AND SUBSIDIES&#13;
- The c.i.f. dollar prize that a manufacturer is able to quote to a&#13;
potential foreign customer for a ga ment depends upon the cust of&#13;
producing the good (costs of labor, fabric, cther inputs and overhead),&#13;
the cost of transporting it to the foreign country, any subsidies or ot3 or&#13;
assistance th_, the manufacturer receives from the governmenL for exporting, and&#13;
the exchange rate. To try to understand why it is that Colombian price&#13;
quotes are so mu-h higher than those of Korea, I-long Kong and Taiwan,&#13;
each of these elements wiJl be examined separatcly.-.&#13;
TRANSPOIR AND COMUNICATIONS&#13;
Because they have to travel such a relatively short distance, and because of&#13;
problems with shipping services, 99.9 percent of Colombia's clothing exports are&#13;
transported to the United States by air. By contrast, over 80 percent of Fast Asia's&#13;
clothing exports to thc United States are sent by sea (Table 5.1).1) The cost of&#13;
airfreighting garments from Bogota to New York is 6C    .&#142;nts a kilogralm;tlle cost of&#13;
flying them from East Asia is more than four times as great (Table 5.2). Ocean&#13;
freight rates are quoted in dollars per cubic meter and hence are difficult to&#13;
compare with air freight costs, which are quoted in dollars per kilogram. Never-&#13;
theless, since it is clear that it costs only a little less to ship garmentsJ&#13;
from Colombia to the United States by sea than by air2 , it follows from the data&#13;
in Tables 5.2 and 5.3 that the cost of shipping garments to the United States&#13;
1.  As might be exp_ *ed, the fraction that is sent by air tends to be of&#13;
higher than averaS,e unit value. This may be seen from the fact that&#13;
the proportion of the value of Fast Asia's clothing exports that is&#13;
flown to the United States is significantly greater thap the proportion&#13;
of their volume that arrives by air (Table 5.1).&#13;

- 99 -&#13;
by sea from East Asia is ro-iglly the same as the cost of transporting thcm&#13;
by air from Colombia. (Converting these transport costs to a per ga,ollent&#13;
rate - an example is provided in Table 5.4   - they range from .1boult 5 percent&#13;
of the f.o.b. price or less for lightweight items like women's bltises&#13;
o' synthetic fabrics to 10 percent or more for heavyweialht, relatively&#13;
;'axpeysive merchandise like classic denim jeans).&#13;
80 percent of East Asia's clothing exports that arrive bv&#13;
Je,, .nerefore, thc big disac-  vge compared to Colcmbia is not in&#13;
freight costs but in the till.- r.   in transit.  Colombian goods&#13;
can be flown to the United States in a matter of hours; froim East Asia&#13;
the voyage by sea takes about four weeks (Table 5.5).   This gives Colombia&#13;
a tremendous potential advantage over the East Asian couintries. For one&#13;
thing, it makes the usc of the U.S. 807 offshore assembly schemTie feasible.&#13;
(It is' not by chance that the first six nations in the list of those who&#13;
export apparel to the United Sta,es using the 807 scheme are withill five&#13;
hours flying time from the II.S. (Table 1.11 above)).At least as important,&#13;
in an industry in which every week is crucial, the time differeatial allows&#13;
buyers who import from Colombia the chance to wait one month longer than&#13;
those who import from East Asia before having to take the make-or-break&#13;
decision on what they think will be "in" next season.&#13;
For sales to Europe, Colombian and Fast Asian transport costs and times&#13;
are more evenly matched.  Air freight charges from all four ccuntries to&#13;
Europe are similar to (or, for Korea, greater than) air freight costs&#13;
from East Asia to the United States   and hence are prohibitive for mnst&#13;
goods (Table 5.2).  Ocearn freight rates from Barranquilla to London are&#13;
about the same as tho;e from East A.sia, while ocean rates from nrar:ulalillIa&#13;
to Amsterdam and Hamburg exceed those from East Asia by 20-2S per-cent&#13;

- I ( 02 -&#13;
'Table 5..3).  Offsetting this cost difference, the journey from East&#13;
Asia to Eurolc takes about a week longer than that from Barranquilla&#13;
(Table 5.5) - though sailings from East Asia ari-c available much more frequently.&#13;
In in industry in which there often has to he close and constant&#13;
contact between buyer and manufacturer, the cost and ease of nvailability&#13;
of international communications services is also important. The cost&#13;
of commtinicating between Colombia and the United States is in general&#13;
less than or equal to the cost of communicating between the llnited&#13;
States and East Asia (Table 5.6). A 1P.S. buyer wilo wishes to visit&#13;
his supplier need pay only $567 for a round trip ticket to Rogot.-t,&#13;
compared :.ith three times this amtount for a trip to Hong Kong, Taipei&#13;
or Seoul.  A three minute plione call from the llnited States to Seoul&#13;
costs 50 nercent more than one co Rcgot;lr: a call to liong Kong or Taipei&#13;
costs 33 percent more. Telex and cables from the Ulnited States east&#13;
coast cost rouglhly the same to all four destinations  but the unavailability&#13;
of a special night letter rate for telegrams to Colombia makes this the&#13;
one form of communication in whiich that country is at a disadvantage.&#13;
At least partially offsetting these cost disadvantages, the availability&#13;
and reliability of communications to East Asia tend to be superior.   Flights&#13;
to that part of the world operate much more frequently than to latin Americal)&#13;
ind a special bargain fare increases the attractiveness of the East Asian&#13;
trip: a businessman can stop off in Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei and lHong Kong for&#13;
tile same price as for a regular round-trilp visit to llong Kong alone.  The&#13;
phones tend to work more reliably in East Asia   andl gari;ent  firms are&#13;

In summary, whereas for exports of clothing to Europe Colombia and&#13;
East Asia face relatively similar transport costs and conditions, for&#13;
exports to the United States Colombians have a distinct advantage:    at no&#13;
extra cost, thev can land goods at their destination four weeks faster than&#13;
East Asians. This serves to illustrate why the United States is the logical&#13;
market or Colombia's clothing exports - but it is of no help at all in&#13;
explaining why Colombians have been unable to compete in price with East&#13;
Asians in that market.&#13;

Comparisons of hagc levels across countries arc made difficult by&#13;
the need to include fringe benefits.   These often vary considerably from&#13;
firm to firm withlin one country,and it is not always possible to find&#13;
reliable data on their average or typical size. For Colombia, a recent&#13;
detailed examination of the clothing industry in the Aburra' Valley&#13;
(Medellin) area by Pelaez (1978) found that fringe benefits add 45 percent&#13;
to the cash ;%age on average.  Pelaez's figure is probably more reliable&#13;
than the estimates obtained in interviews for the present study because&#13;
the latter: (a) were usually given off the top of the hcad without books&#13;
being consulted; and (b) varied so widely even among apparently similar&#13;
enterprises as to make one suspect that some firms were enterprises as to&#13;
make one suspect that some firms were including items (e.g. provisions&#13;
for eventual retirement payments) that others were omitting. The highest&#13;
estimate, obtained from &lt; few firms in interviews, was that fringe benefits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
can reach 100 percent of the cash wage. Table 5.7 presents tho alternative&#13;
sets of wage data for Colombia: one assumes that fringe benefits are 45&#13;
percent of the cash wage; the other assumes, as an upper bound, that they are&#13;
100 percent.1)&#13;
To thc best of my- knowiedge, Hong. Kong i; the lnily country of the&#13;
four under stuldy here that -.ihlishes wage data both excluding and including&#13;
fringe benefits.  For Korea, a description was available of the fringe&#13;
benefits that are typically naid   but not of their cost.  For Taiwan,&#13;
since I cotild find nc n lata e., fringe benefits at all, the conservaltive&#13;
assumption is made that they are considerably less than in Colowlia.&#13;
Data on thie hourly wage excluding fringe benefits in the clothing&#13;
indL. try are available for all four countries.  In 1973, this wage&#13;
in Co.,.-bia was about half that in llong Kong, about thc same as that&#13;
in Taiwan, and alnost 50 percent greater than that in Korea.  By 1977,&#13;
however, the situation had chintilgedl radically: Colombia was now the lowest&#13;
wage countrv of the four.  The before-tax take-home wage of a Colombian&#13;
garment worker in that year was 30 cents an hiotir, compared with 40 cents in&#13;
Korea, 51 in Taiwan, and 75 in llong Kong.&#13;
If the Pclacz estimate of 45 percent for Colombian fringe benefits&#13;
is uised, the wage including fringe benefits follows essentially    the&#13;
same pattern. Tn 1973, Colombian wages including fringe benefits were&#13;
well below those in Hong Kong, p. )bably greater than those in Taiwan,&#13;
and significantly' greater than those in Korea. By 1977, the Colombian&#13;
wage inccluding fringc benefits was harely more than halr of that in lhong&#13;
Kong, was 14 percent lower than the wage excluding fringe benefits in&#13;
1.  In Colombia, it is "ore difficult and costly to fire workers than in East Asia.&#13;
This "fringe benefit" is not taken into account hiere; but see Chapter 7.&#13;

Notes:&#13;
ai fihe 1973 figures are extrapolated from Miorawetz (1971); in 1967 arnd 1971, Colombia,&#13;
wages without fringe benefits were 221 cents an hour. The fi.ures for 197% and&#13;
1977 refer to the Aburra' Valley (Medell&#143;n) area, and are from Pel&#143;cz (1978).&#13;
Pel,&#143;ez fouind that fringe benefits add 45 percent to wage costs. By,contrast,&#13;
in the interviews for the present study some entrepreneurs claimed that, once&#13;
provision for sev'erance payments and other often-omitted items are itaken into ac-&#13;
count, fringe benefits can reach 100 percent. Hience, thie Colombian wage including&#13;
fringe benefits is presented here once assuming that fringe benefit; are 45&#13;
percent and once assuming, as an upper bound, that tlhey are 100 percent. Our&#13;
interviewees indicated that wages in 1978 were about 33-47 cents an hoiir, or&#13;
abouit 66-94 cents an hour assuminig fringe benefits of 100 percent. This probably&#13;
overstates the average for the clothing industry as a whole because large firms,&#13;
which generarly pay higher than. average wages, are over-represented'in our sample.&#13;

because the East Asians "pay their workers miserable wages" that Colombian&#13;
clothing firms cannot compete with thema in price.1)&#13;
LABOR PROPlUCTIVITY&#13;
Wages give information on the cost of labor per hour worked; but a&#13;
businessman needs to know the cost of labor per garment produced. The&#13;
missing link is the number of garments produced per hour worked, or labor&#13;
productivity.&#13;
Labor productivity in the clothing industry tends to rise over time&#13;
not as a resul' of quantum jumps in the type of machinery used   but rather&#13;
through the implem6ntation of large numbers of small improvements&#13;
in particular operations or in the organization of the production process.&#13;
Some examples of improvements like these were mentioned above in the&#13;
discussion of the technical assistance provided to Colombian firms under&#13;
brand-name licensing agreements - reorganizing production flows, introducing&#13;
new methods of cutting, sewing, or joining materials, minimizing the down-&#13;
time of machinery, and so forth. Some productivity increases do arise&#13;
as a result of improvements in the machinery itself but such innovations&#13;
are usually rather less than revolutionary: built-in thread clippers and&#13;
needle-positionersa automatic button-holers, pocket-setters and polybaggers,&#13;
machine speeds of 4,500 stitches a minute instead of 2,SOO.   Because most&#13;
measures to increase productivity in garment-making involve changing ways .&#13;
1. Relative vage levels clearly play no part, either, in explaining the&#13;
rise and fall of Colombia's clothing exports to the United States&#13;
and Europe; for the ratio of Colombian to East Asian wages was higher&#13;
during thc rise than it was during the decline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
of doing and organizing things rather thian introducing new machinery,&#13;
the efficiency of management, and especially middle-level management,&#13;
tends to be crucial.  An illustration of the way in which productivity&#13;
improvement has taken place over time in the production of a particular&#13;
garment (men's trousers in the United States since the 1940's) is presented&#13;
in Table 5.8.&#13;
In the interviews with Colombian firms, I was forttnate to come across&#13;
a number of managers who were aware that a U.S. company (usually an&#13;
importer-manufacturer or a brand-name licensor) was producing a garment&#13;
identical to the one that they themselves were fabricating   and who were&#13;
able and willing to provide data on the precise nunber of minutes required&#13;
to cut, make and trim that garment both in Colombia and in the United&#13;
States.  (Interestingly enough, no Colombian   manager claimed to have&#13;
comparable data for East Asia, this despite the fact that in several cases&#13;
parallel licensors in Korea or Taiwan were known to be producing identiail&#13;
garments). I was fortunate, also,to be able to obtain estimates of average&#13;
labor productivity in the manufacturing of specific garments in Colombia,&#13;
East Asia and the United States from a firm of international consultants&#13;
that has specialized in the apparel business for several decades and that&#13;
knows all three areas well.   The average figures for Colombia and the&#13;
United States that were provided by the consilting firm are roughly&#13;
consistent with the data provided by Colombian   managers; if anything, the&#13;
consultant's estimates of labor productivity in Colombia are a little&#13;
higher than those derived from the interviews.&#13;

The full set of information that is available on labor productivit;&#13;
in Colombia, East Asia and the United States from both the consulting firm&#13;
and the interviews is sun,marized in Table 5.9. On average, labor produc-&#13;
tivity appears to be 30 to 50 percent higher in East Asia than in Colombia,&#13;
while productivity in the United States may be up to 50 percent higher&#13;
again.  )&#13;
Although eleven of the Colombian sample fir.ns that appear in Table 5.9&#13;
appear to be operating below, and often well below, East Asian productivity&#13;
levels, for two companies this is not the case. Ci.e is the jeans producer&#13;
which, as mentioned in Chapter 3, has doubled its labor productivity as a&#13;
result of receiving technical assistance from a foreign licensor: this&#13;
enterprise is now producing at approximatelv the East Asian productivity&#13;
level. The other is the maker of suit coats which increased its labor&#13;
productivity by two-thirds as the result of receiving assistance from a&#13;
U.S. importer-manufacturer. Interestingly. a second Colombian producer of&#13;
the identical suit coat, which has been the recipient of the same technical&#13;
assistance from the same source, has thus far not been able to improve its&#13;
Though the sample is small, it seems that there may he some systematic&#13;
relationship between type of garment and productivity differential.&#13;
Among the articles surveyed here, Colombia's disadvantage appears to&#13;
be greatest in men's shirts.   The production of men's shirts&#13;
in the United States and East Asia is more mechanized than that of&#13;
almost any other garment - on some operations the investment required&#13;
to equip a plant with state-of-the-art shirt-production technology&#13;
is now as much as $35,000 per operator (Armfield, 1977) - but few Colombian&#13;
firms possess the latest equipment.&#13;
2. Data from Hasan (1976) are approximately consistent with these figures. lie&#13;
states that in the mid 1970s Korean labor produc ivity in garment production&#13;
was about 75 percent of European levels. For example, the time required to&#13;
produce a long-sleeved shirt was 27 minutes in Korea compared with 20 minutes&#13;
in Germany; for zhort sleeved shirts it was 18 minutes compared with&#13;

labor productivity at all.   The problem, apparently, is that even though the&#13;
wages that are paid by this firm depend on output, some workers h.ave been&#13;
unwilling to change the way that they have traditonally done things; and&#13;
the management of this large and well-known company apparently does not have&#13;
sufficient shop-floor-level control to convince them to do so. The example&#13;
of the two suit-coat firms serves to illustrate how i,mportant management, and&#13;
especiall) middle-level management, is to garment-making; it seems certain&#13;
1)&#13;
that a large part of Colombia's productivity problem has its source here. On&#13;
the other hand, the examples of the jeans manufacturer and the more&#13;
successful suit-coat maker illustrate that Colombian firms which are&#13;
exceptionally-well managed (as these two enterpriscs are) and which&#13;
have access to foreign techrical heln can indeed produce up to, and even&#13;
above, aveage East Asian productivity levels.&#13;
In sum, depending on what one beiieves about the size of fringe&#13;
benefits in the different countries. labor costs measure(d in dollars&#13;

FABRIC PRICES&#13;
I was at a textile fair in Denmark last month ancd I came across&#13;
some corduLroy that was made by (oltejcr.  Even if you include .he&#13;
transport costs in both directions, it would have cost me less to&#13;
buy that fabric in Coper.hagen and ship it back here [$3 a meter c.i.f.]&#13;
than it costs me to huy it in Colombia [.S4.27 a meter ex factory3.&#13;
Of course, I would have to pay tariffs, and there woould be a long&#13;

Colombia and East Asia arc examined in Chapter 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
time lost in transit... Still if, for some reason, I particularly&#13;
wanted to use precisely that Coltcjer fabric for exporting and no&#13;
other, it would certainly be cheaper to import it from the U;.ited&#13;
States or Europe using the Vallejo Plan than to buy it direc. from&#13;
the factory in Medellin.&#13;
- Colombian jeans manufacturer&#13;
Apparel-manufacturing is the most labor-intensive of all industries,&#13;
but it is even more fabric-inten'cive than it is labor-intensive. In&#13;
Colombia and East Asia, depending on the tpl)e of garment and the nature&#13;
of the cloth, the share of fabric costs in the total costs of producing&#13;
a garment (3S to 60 percent) is often double the slhare of labor costs&#13;
-1)&#13;
(15 to 25 percent).    Consequently, as Escobar   points out,&#13;
"onc can almost establish as an axiom that when the fabric is not exportable&#13;
as fabric, nor is it exportable as a garment."')&#13;
In llong Kong. Korea and Taiwan, a wide range of cotton   and synthetic3)&#13;
fabrics is available to garment exporters at world prices either from&#13;
domestic sources or as easily-accessible duty-free imports from a fellow&#13;
East Asian nation (especially Japan) or elsewhere. In Colombia, the&#13;
situation is rather different.&#13;
Some synthetic fibers and the petrochemicals on which they are based&#13;
are produced in Colombia; but the plants are ;mall by world standards,&#13;
cannot take advantage of economies of scale, and have highi unit productioni&#13;
1. The share of labor is higher, and the share of fabric is correspondingly&#13;
lower, in high-wage countries like the United States. On these proportions,&#13;
see e.g. Allison (1977), Escobar (1977), Pel1&#143;ez (1978), and Scott (1979).&#13;
2.  Escobar (1977, p.9, emphasis added).&#13;

to include all man-made fibers.&#13;

costs.1) As a result, Colombian synthetic textiles are priced well above&#13;
world levels  and are rarely exported either as fabric or in made-up&#13;
garments. For many synthetic fabrics the ratio between the Colombian&#13;
price and the world price was 3:1 until a few years ago; more recently.&#13;
smuggled imports have kept the rate of increase of prices of syntlhetic&#13;
fabrics below that of cotton cloths and the differential has now fallen&#13;
to 2:1.   The cos. of the overpricing of synthetic fabrics to the Colombian&#13;
economy in terms of foregone clothing exports seems unlikely to diminish&#13;
in the future; on the contrary, accrding to the recent forecast of a&#13;
group of IU.S. apparel specialists, non-cellulosic synthetics are likely&#13;
to contintue to inc.ease their slhare of the total weight of apparel through&#13;
the year 2000 (Table 5.10).&#13;
By contrast with the situation in synthetics, the basic constituent&#13;
of cotton textiles - raw cotton - is available domestically&#13;
in Colombia at  wor!ld prices.  Since textile manufacturing is one of the&#13;
oldest, largest, and most efficient industries in the country, and since exports&#13;
of cotton textiles amounted to about $75-100 million a year during 1974-783),&#13;
1.  These plants are able to survive only because they receive substantial&#13;
protection against foreign competition from the government's tariff&#13;
and licensing system. Four of the five synthetic fiber plants so&#13;
protected are more than 50 percent foreign-owned; see Morawetz (19751.&#13;
2.  For obvious reasons   we did not ask clothling exporters whether they&#13;
used smuggled fabric in their business - but three firms felt safe&#13;
enough to volunteer that they do anyway.   This suggests that, at least&#13;
among smaller finns in the coastal regions, the use of smuggled&#13;
synthetic fabric may not be uncommon.&#13;
3.  INCOMEX,unpublished tabulations,Expo 5,1974-77,and Colombia Information Service&#13;
(1979).It is said that the textile firms lave been forced to continLue exporting 1h&#13;
the terms on which thiey received large-scale emergency loans From the government&#13;
in 1975 - but thiey began exportinig long before that date.  It is interesting,&#13;
incidentally, that although Coltejer's earnings as reportcd in its financial&#13;
reports fell in 1975, its profits were nevertlheless still positive in that&#13;
so-called crisis year.&#13;

it might be expected that domestically-produced cotten fabrics wotuld he&#13;
available to local clothing producers at world prices. Yet the most&#13;
common and most vehement complaint that was expresse(d by apparel producers&#13;
during the interviews was that they have to pay far more than world&#13;
prices, often even double, for their cotton fabrics - even for precisely&#13;
the same fabrics as their textile suppliers export!&#13;
To check whether these claims had any foundatien, I first approached&#13;
the managers of one of the smallest of the big four textile proclucers&#13;
with a request for detailed data on the firm's domestic and foreign selling&#13;
prices for certain key fabrics. Unfortunately, the little information&#13;
that they were willing to provide was neitlher enlightening nor credible;&#13;
so I decided to change tactics. Speaking as the imaginary director of a&#13;
fictitious New York apparel firm, I telephoned the export departments&#13;
of each of the two largest textile producers in December 1978 and asked&#13;
them for price quotes for delivery in New York in two months time of&#13;
50,000 meters of each of five pants fabrics. Pant" fabrics were selected&#13;
because two of these, indigo denim and corduroy, make up the bulk of&#13;
Colombia's exports of fully-finished fabrics; and because, in keeping&#13;
with Escobar's   aboVe-quoted axiom, the bulk of Colombia's exports of clothing&#13;
that use domestic fabric are pants or iealls of inedigo&#13;
denim or corduroy. liaving earlier obtained list and discount prices&#13;
from local agencies of the two textile firms, I was then able to compare&#13;
the export price quotes for these five fabrics with the price charged&#13;
to   large domestic clothing manufacturers.&#13;
The results of this exercise are summarized in Table 5.11.    The five&#13;
fabrics, all of lOO percent cotton, ranged in degree of overpricing from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
50 to 108 percent, with an avcrage of 7.1 percent; the all-important&#13;
corduroy and indigo-denim were overpriced by 71 and 70 percent (avcrage&#13;
of two quotes) respectively. Given that the cost of the fabric usuially&#13;
represents at least 40 percent of the value of a finished garment, with&#13;
degrees of overpricing like these, it is remarkable that Colombian firms&#13;
have been able to export any apparel at all using domestic fabric. And&#13;
indeed, the proportion of clothing exports to the United States that&#13;
use fabric imported under the Vallejo Plan rose from 56 percent in 1974-&#13;
7S to 76 percent in 1976-77 (Table 5.12) as profits from exporting began&#13;
to be squeezed by the fall in the real effective exchange rate. Of the&#13;
thirteen sample firms that were still exporting to the United States in&#13;
1978, only one was predominantly using domestic fabric and the U.S. exports&#13;
of that firm amounted to less than half a million dollars.l)&#13;
The effects of fabric overpricing on exports of apparel to the United States&#13;
can be seen clearly in the breakdown of these exports by fabric and garment that&#13;
is presented in Fig. 1.4 and Tables 1.7-1.10 above. During 1972-78, despite the&#13;
fact that over 80 percent of all textile exports were of cotton textiles, exports&#13;
of cotton garments never exceeded $3m, or 20 percent by volume of total garment&#13;
exports to the United States. Equally striking, exports of pants (including jeans)&#13;
of denim and corduroy to the United States had fallen to less than hialf a million&#13;
dollars in 1978 and seem never to have exceeded $3m in any year 1971-78    -&#13;
this despite the fact that corduroy and denim are Colombia's two main exportable&#13;
1.  The fact that over half of total clothing exports to all dest,:atlons&#13;
still apparently used domestic fabric in 1977 (Tablc 5.12) reflects&#13;
partly an apparent under-reporting in the INCOMEX registrations of the&#13;
extent to which the Vallejo Plan is used and partly the fact that the&#13;
prices of apparel in the Margarita Islands and the Caribbean are so high&#13;
that some exporters can still compete using either local fabrics or&#13;
imported fabrics on which duty has been paid.&#13;

fabrics and that pants- and jeans-making seems to be the single most popumar&#13;
export activity in the country (Tablc 4.4 above).   Looking at the issue froln&#13;
a slightly different perspective, during 1972-77 16 percent of thc value of&#13;
primarily cotton-containing exports consisted of raw cotton, 45 percent was&#13;
cotton textiles, and onily 9 percent was cottoji garments.1)&#13;
The effects of fabric overpricing on the decision-making and profitabi-&#13;
lity of an individual garment-exporting company may be illustrated with&#13;
data from the firm, introduced. in ChaDter 3, that exports two sets of pants&#13;
that are identical in all respects except that on', is domestically- and the&#13;
other is internationally-branded. The manager of that firm provided me with a&#13;
comparison, for the domestically-branded pants, of the costs of production&#13;
that he would incur and the profits that he would receive if domestic&#13;
fabric were substituted for imported fabric but everything else remained&#13;
the same (Tab]e 3.1 above, columns 2 and 3). The domestic fabric would&#13;
have been 63 percent more expensive than the imported one; in addition,&#13;
the imported cloth was of better quality, which cnabled the manufacturer&#13;
to increase the sales price of the pants by 25 percent. The net result&#13;
was that the use of domestic fabric would have yielded a loss amounting&#13;
to 3 percent of total outlays, whereas the use of imported fabric yielded&#13;
a profit of 28 percent.  Needloss to say, the manufacturer used the&#13;
inmported fabric&#13;
As this instance suggests, althouglh the overpricing of locally-prodtuced&#13;
fabrics necessarily causes the domestic content of garment exports to fall,&#13;

of such exports need not bc affccted too seriously. In Colombian practice,&#13;
however, peculi..,ities of the Valleio Plan, the Customs Department, and&#13;
the ports combine in many cases to make the importing option less real&#13;
than it would seem to bc; consideration of these problems is postponed&#13;
until the following chapter.&#13;
In addition to having tr,iditionalIv b-een high hy world standards,&#13;
tile prices of many Colonjian fa'.rics have risen particularly fast in&#13;
recent years.  In the case of the two most important fabrics, the peso&#13;
prices paid by local garment mahers for Colombian indigo denim and&#13;
corduroy increaised by 130 and 150 percent respectively hbt%een January&#13;
1976 and Janualry 1979 at the same tine as the official&#13;
exchange rate increased by less th-in 25 pelceit (Talbles  5.13&#13;
and 5. 14).  Io place thecsc increases in perspective it woulnd&#13;
be necessary to comp)are tlemin \ith price riseCS for idenitical fabrics&#13;
elsewhere in the world.  Although thie data necdcd for this comparison&#13;
are not easily available, it nevertheless seems reasonahle to assume that&#13;
-te steep rises in key fabric prices that have taken place since early&#13;
1976 Iave contributed at least to   one extent to the post-1975 decline of&#13;
Colombia's clothinig exports to thie United States.&#13;
How is it that the producers of textiles in Colombia - incliuling the&#13;
firm that employs Escohar, whose axiom was quioted in the first paragraph&#13;
of this section - are able to get aw.y with charging (lomestic garment&#13;
manufacttirers 50 to lN)O percent more than they clhirge fcreigners for the&#13;
same fabrics, seriously damalgilng the nation's clothing exports in tile&#13;
process?  The immediate rear ~n is that thiey are well protected against&#13;
competitio'i from imports.  D)espite the fact that Colombia has exported&#13;
large volumes of cotton textiles for more than a (decade, anyone wishing to&#13;
import cotton fabric still hazis to pay d1uties of 55-75 percent of the value&#13;
of the clothi.  Impor-ts of synthetic fabrics pay dities of 40-SS percent&#13;

and are subject to licensing; imports of woolen fabrics pay 75 percent.&#13;
Behind this protection the more fundamental reason lies in economic&#13;
and political power.   The textile industry employs more people than any&#13;
other industry in Colombia. It is heavily concentrated in Medellin,&#13;
the nation's industrial capital; it is said in Colombia that withotit&#13;
Medellin  no President is elected.   The industry is run as a tight oligopoly -&#13;
Coltejer has about SO percent of the market, Fabricato has about 30&#13;
percent  and the top four firms together control over 90 percent.l    There is&#13;
a clear pattern of price leadership: Coltejer raises its prices, the&#13;
others follow within a week or two. Coltejer's sheer size may be appreciated&#13;
from the fact that, if the heterogeneous food processing sector is excluded,&#13;
it alone employs more persons than any manufacturing industry in Colombia. 'rhe&#13;
one serious challenge to the power of the textile firms that has been thrown&#13;
out in recent years was the attempt of the reformist administration&#13;
of President Alfonso Lo"pez Michelsen in 1976 to transfer synthetic fabrics&#13;
from the list of imports requiring a prior license to the free list.&#13;
Within six months, the transferral was reversed.&#13;
PRICES OF OTHER INPUTS&#13;
Whereas East Asian garment manufacturers can obtain most other non-&#13;
fabric inputs at world prices either domestically or from easily-accessible&#13;
imports, Colombians are less fortunate.   In 1978,    Colombian apparel firms&#13;
had  to     pay three times the duty-free c.i.f. price of compcting imports&#13;
1.  Both Coltejer and Fabricato arc based in Medellin and the Coltcjer&#13;
building happens to be the tallest building in the city.&#13;

for locally-madc zippeers  and double the duty-free c.i.f. price for&#13;
thread. As is the case with fabric, the reason for this overpricing&#13;
lies partly in the high degrce of industrial concentration - only one large&#13;
firm in Colombia makes zippa)rs    and only one or two large cntcrprises&#13;
manufacture thread, linings and cardboard cartons - and paiLly in the&#13;
protection again.t competing imports that is granted by the tariff and(&#13;
licensing system, on the one hand, and the bureaucratic and administrative&#13;
problems involved in importing, on the other.&#13;
CAPITAL UTILIZATION&#13;
Although fixed capital costs account for a small proportion of total&#13;
outlays in garment manufacturing (usually less than 10 percent), the degree&#13;
to which buildings and machinery are utilized neverthc'ess has some&#13;
influence on total costs and hence on price. Of the 30 firms in the&#13;
Colombian sample, only tw.o of the best-managed enterprises ncrmally operatc&#13;
more than one shift.  Among the managers of the other 28 firms, many did&#13;
not seem to have considered seriously the possibility of running the plant&#13;
for more tha.n one shift; others cited difficulty in finding reliable night&#13;
managers and supervisors and problems in apportioning respoTisibilty for&#13;
care of sewing machines among night and day operators as their- reasons&#13;
for running one shift only.  In Taiwan, single shifting seems to be the&#13;
rule in garment-makingll on Korea, I have no data; but in llong Kong, where&#13;
floor-space is scarce and hence expensive, multiple shiftiig is, I believc,&#13;
not uncommon.&#13;

EXPORT SUBSIDIES AND EFFECTIVE PROTECTION&#13;
Several Colombian apparel manufacturers asserted during interviews&#13;
that the reason that East Asian clothing exporters are able to charge&#13;
stuch lowY prices for their products is that they receive massive government&#13;
assistance. In fact, this seems not to be the case. In laissez-faire&#13;
Hong Kong, there are no government subsidies to exports at all. In Korea,&#13;
the effective value of all export ircentive measures - including reductions&#13;
in direct and indirect taxes, wastage allowances, preferential access&#13;
to credit, and preferential electricity and railroad rates-- arounted to&#13;
only 12 percent on average in 1968, and seems to have changed little since&#13;
then.1) For Taiwan, I have not been able to find a calculation of the&#13;
effective value of export incentives; but given the nature of the incentives&#13;
that hale been available - exemption from some indirect taxes, deduction&#13;
of two percent of annual export earnings from taxable income, availability&#13;
of low interest loans to finance imports of raw materials and machinery&#13;
used in exporting, and availability of government-provided export insurance2)-&#13;
it seems unlikely that they add up to more than 10 or 15 percent of the&#13;
value of exports. Contrary to the Colombian manufacturers' beliefs, then,it&#13;
seems that the effective value of the export incentives that they themselves&#13;
have received - 14 to 20 percent during 1967-74 and 1977-79, and 8 percent&#13;
in 1975-76 (Table 2.2 above) - have generally been greater--than or equal&#13;
to those granted to apparel exporters in East Asia.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
In analyzing the price-related influence of government on exports,&#13;
although the absolute value of export incentives is of some interest,&#13;
at least as important is the impact of the entire system of export&#13;
subsidies and import restrictions on the relative profitability of selling&#13;
goods abroad or at home. Hong Kong grants its firms no protection against&#13;
imports at all; hence the incentives to export and to sell domestically&#13;
are equal. In both Korea and Taiwan, although there is considerable&#13;
variation among products and over time, the net effect of the incentive&#13;
system on average has been to make selling abroad about as profitable as&#13;
1)&#13;
selling at home. In Colombia, by contrast, the trade incentive system has&#13;
caused selling at home to be much more profitable, on average, than exporting.&#13;
llntil 1973, the Colombian import duty on finished garments was over&#13;
200 percent and almost all imports were prohibited in any case. Since&#13;
then, imports of clothing have been subject to prior licensing and to&#13;
tariffs that are still greater than 90 percent, and have never amounted&#13;
to more than $2 million or 1 percent of total domestic sales in any one&#13;
year (Table 1.13 above). The low volume of legal imports has been&#13;
supplemented to some extent by smuggling, but illegal imports seem to&#13;
have been restricted mainly to the coastal markets and, Pierre Cardin under-&#13;
wear notwithstanding, to goods in the lower price ranges.&#13;
Although garment-making is onc of the more competitive industries&#13;
in Colombia, the domestic market is to some extent segmented by product&#13;
and by geographical location. Thus, for example, the manager of the&#13;
firm that produces fashion clothing for middle-aged women claimed to have&#13;
1. See the references cited in the previous two footnotes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
no local competitors at all; thrce or four large companies dominate the mr.rket&#13;
for men's underwear; and there is only one major producer of jeans&#13;
in the Bucaramanga area. Tlis market segmentation further raises the&#13;
profitability of domestic sales.&#13;
A rough quantitative estimate of the extent to which the Colombian&#13;
trade incentive system has favored domestic sales over exports can&#13;
be obtained by comparing the effective rates of protection that have&#13;
been granted to import substitutes with those granted to exports (Table&#13;
5.15).2) Effective protection received by clothing exporters who did&#13;
not use the Vallejo Plan was negative throughout 1967-78, varying from&#13;
a high of -26 percent in 1974 to a low of -51 percent when the CAT&#13;
was reduced sharply in 1975. By contrast, effective protection for&#13;
domestic sale was always positive, ranging from 119 to 346 percent.&#13;
This latter set of figures is misleading since it assumes that there was&#13;
no water at all in the apparel tariff. Nevertheless, the price data&#13;
that are available from the interviews on two categories of clothing&#13;
(jeans, and blouses and shirts) yield the same qualitative conclusions:&#13;
effective protection for domestic sale was strongly positive whereas that&#13;
for foreign sale  was heavily negative (Table 5.16). 2)&#13;
The only exporters who received positive effective protection for&#13;
foreign sales during 1967-78 were those using the Vallejo Plan. Effective&#13;
1. On the calculation of effective rates of protection see, for example,&#13;
Corden (1969). Although the data cited in this paragraphi refer to&#13;
limited liability firms, the conclusions are similar for public companies.&#13;
2. .Jeans and shirts and blouses were the only two relatively homogeneous&#13;
categories of clothing in which the number of observations in the&#13;
interviews was sufficient to enable reliable comparisons to be made.&#13;
Fabric costs are assumed to be 50 percent of total costs in both cases,&#13;
but the qualitative results are the same whatever plausible percentage is&#13;
used.&#13;

protection for a limited liability company using this plan varied f:om a&#13;
high of 33 percent in 1973 to a low of 8 percent in 1975 and stood at&#13;
19 percent in 1978 (Table 5.15). An exporter of blouises and shirts using&#13;
the plan still wuuld have received greater effective protection in 1978&#13;
if he had concentrated on the domestic market; but a jeans manufacturer&#13;
using the plaln received slightly higher effective protection for exports&#13;
than for sales at home (Table 5.16).   These findings serve to re-emphasize&#13;
the importance of the high price of domestic fabric in biasing producers&#13;
against exporting and the importance of the yet-to-be-discussed non-price&#13;
barriers to importing fabric in restrir ing Vallejo Plan exports.&#13;
At the cnd of Chapter 2 it was asked why Colombia's exports of&#13;
garments to thie United States levelled off or recovered slightly in 1978-79.&#13;
In the light of the analysis in this section, this question might now be&#13;
broadened to: if selling at home is in general more profitable than exporting,&#13;
why are any Colombian garment-makers still exporting at all?    It was mentioned&#13;
in Clhapter 2 that a few important firms have closc financial ties with their&#13;
toreign buyers, and that some firms appear to be holding onto thpir overseas&#13;
markets during a difficult period in the hope of better times to come;&#13;
thcsc reasons are no doubt relevant to the b;oader question as well.    In&#13;
addition, at least three further factors maV help to explain the continuance&#13;
(and, to the neighboring markets, the giowth) of Colombia's apparel exports.&#13;
First, for some firms that export to the Margarita Islands and the Caribbean&#13;
where prices are high, exporting is indeed as profitable,or almost as&#13;
profitablc,as selling domestically. It is presumably no coincidence that of&#13;
the seven sample firms that exported 90 percent or morc of their output in&#13;
1978 (Table 5.17), five sold predominantly to the Margarita Islands and the&#13;

Caribbean and the other two did 807 assembly work for one U.S. client each.&#13;
(One of the latter two is the only firm in the sample that is forcign&#13;
(buyer) owned).  Second, some companies that are still exporting face&#13;
a limited domestic market for tlheir prodlucts; exports may yield lower&#13;
per-tunit profits for thcse companies than domestic sales but they still add&#13;
to total profits.  Last, but not least, a number of enterprises seem to&#13;
be exporting mainly for reasons other than its direct profitability. Some&#13;
want to maintain an export image in the domestic market: advertisements&#13;
including "export quality" or "we Fell to Saks" are thought to help domestic&#13;
sales.  Others are easer to obtain the credit that is directed preferentially&#13;
to exporters and that is sometimes diff4cult for others to ohtaini in&#13;
sufficient quantities. Still others are interested in goverr.wient goodwill;&#13;
in the words of an exporter who was interviewed by Bernhart several years&#13;
ago:     -&#13;
FRighlt now we only break even on exports to the Ulnited States]  but&#13;
when I go to INCOMEX they give me the abrazo, congratulations for my&#13;
patriotic effort, and an import license for anything I want (Bernhart,&#13;
1973, p. 2-22).l)&#13;
The rclatively large number of firms which export a small fraction of their&#13;
total output - even our sample, which is biased towards large-volume exporters,&#13;
inclucdes 7 firms that exported 9 percent of their output or less in 1978&#13;
ard 16 that exported 29 percent or less - presumably includes quite a number for&#13;
whom the indirect benefits are among thc main attractions of selling abroad.&#13;
1. One manager whom I interviewed, who has a larger-than-ustual need to&#13;
import macllinery for the textile side of his business, keeps a running&#13;
estimate of precisely the value of garment exports that he needs to&#13;
sell each year to keep the government's favor. According to the&#13;
apparently reliable figures that he showed me, these exports are mostly&#13;
sold at a loss.&#13;

COSTS AND THE EXCIANGE RATE&#13;
All of the costs that have been converted to U.S. dollars in this chap-&#13;
ter to enable comparison with other countries - costs of transport, labor,&#13;
fabric and other inputs, and so forth - were converted from pesos using the&#13;
official Colombian exchange rate.1) Clearly, if the exchange rate had been&#13;
higher - that is, if the peso had been devalued more rapidly - then,&#13;
other things equal, these costs expressed in terms of dollars would have&#13;
been lower. Thus, although the exchange rate was rarely mentioned&#13;
explicitly in this chapter,in quite a fundamental sense it underlies&#13;
much of the analysis.&#13;
1. Although the Kravis-type pur_hasing-power-parity-adjusted exchange rate&#13;
is appropriately used to compare standards of living across countries,&#13;
the official exchange ratc is the correct one to use for comparing&#13;
costs.&#13;

r4\RKETING, INPUT PROBLEMS, BUREAUCRACY AND QUOTA&#13;
Being abic to supply goods at a competitive price is a necessary&#13;
condition for successful garment exporting, but it is by no means sufficient.&#13;
The potential exporter must also be able, at a minimum, to locate a&#13;
potential foreign buyer, to produce a garment of acceptable quality, and&#13;
to guarantee delivery on time.&#13;
LOCATING BUYERS&#13;
A firm that wants to begin exporting 3nd is seeking its first foreign&#13;
client might approach its government export promotion agency, commission a&#13;
market research study, participate in trade fairs in foreign countries,&#13;
subscribe to trade journals, send its own representatives abroad - or, if&#13;
it is able to do so, it mipht make contact with foreign buyers directly.I)&#13;
In East Asia, this last option - direct contact with foreign buyers or&#13;
their agents- t-nds to be the predominant way in which garment makers&#13;
discover export possibilities. In a study conducted in Taiwan, for&#13;
instance, 83 percent of the managers of apparel firms who were interviewed&#13;
mcntioned foreign customers as a source of information on export sales&#13;
possibilities, wihereas no more than a turd of them mentioned any other&#13;
single source (Table 6.1).   Tn lhong Kong:&#13;
Almost the entire clothing export Ehas been) run by western&#13;
trading companies; they supplied designs and models and '&#13;
often raw materials, too, checked product quality, attended&#13;
to sales and shipping and sometimes also partly to financing.&#13;
At first, these duties werc fulfilled mainly by British&#13;
colonial tracing companies, later they were joined bv the&#13;
buyers of American and European department stores, chain-&#13;
stores, mail-order companies and imlport firms.   An&#13;
estimated 70C of clothing exports passes via subcontracting&#13;
througih the hands of these traders.1)&#13;
1.  Multinational corporations tend to play a relatively small role in the&#13;
international apparel business, and intra-firm exports are much less&#13;
common thani, say, in the electronics industry.&#13;

a) The sample included a total of 415 firms, and was distributed across the&#13;
manufacturing sector so as to be representative of manufactured exports.&#13;
It is biased towards  large   firms  which  export a I'arge proportion of&#13;
their output. The principal question on marketing was: "How do you obtain&#13;
information on sales possibilities for your products in foreign markets?"&#13;
The total number of responses adds to more than 100 percent because many&#13;
firms gave more than one response.&#13;

In Korea, too, buyers, especially from lJapan and&#13;
played a predominant role in st¼nulating garment exports.2)&#13;
In Colombia, by contrast, only about a third of the managers *ho&#13;
were-interviewed for this study me.tioned foreign buyers as a soturce of&#13;
information about export possibilities   whereas over half mentioned trips&#13;
abroad by the firm's principals.   The reason for the difference betteen&#13;
Colombia and East Asia in this regard is both simple and important: there&#13;
are many more resident and visiting foreign buyers in East Asia for a&#13;
prospective garment exporter to contact than there are in Colombia.   In&#13;
part, this is because success breeds success.   The fact that Seoul, Taipei&#13;
and llong Kong are the garment-exporting centers of the developing world&#13;
means that  tens of foreign buiyers and thousands of national and foreign&#13;
trading compainies maintain .'lull-time purchasinig offices there.  In less-&#13;
successfuil Colombia, by contrast, onlv one full-time foreign buyinig office&#13;
specializing in garments was in operation in late 1978, and even it has&#13;
since reverted to part-time commissiohinaire status for lack of business.&#13;
(T'he office operated  full-time for only two or three years).  Partly,&#13;
also,the difference in the number of buyers who can be found in East Asia&#13;
and Colombia reflects externalities of geographical location. A businessman&#13;
who intends to travel to Hong Kong to place some orders can stop off in&#13;
Japan-to'seiect f    ebrics and in Korea and Taiwan to look for potential new&#13;
~pXliicrs. all for the same nrice.   Bogota, by contrast, is not oni the&#13;
establ ished buying route to anywhere - and the same is truie in spades&#13;
of Medellin, Cali, Barrvnquilla and Pereira, Colombia's other centers&#13;
of garment production for export.&#13;

The e           "ich East Asian apparel firi-ms havc access to resie nt&#13;
and visIti.       ign buyers and the:- agents males garment-exporting a&#13;
much less risky business in East Asia than it is in Colombia.     If ai Colombian&#13;
entrepreneur loses a foreign customer, he may have to spend over SI,OO) and&#13;
several days of his time on a trip abroad to find another one. In Holng Kong, thc&#13;
proprietor of a firm whose buyer decidtes to go elsewhere has to dlo little&#13;
more to find a replacement than pick up the telephionie.1)&#13;
In both East Asia and Colombia, the overseas offices of government&#13;
export promotion agencies have been of little assistance in helping firms&#13;
to locate new buyers. That this shotild he so is not suirprisinig: two or&#13;
three officials are unlikely to know as much about the full range of a&#13;
country's indu4tries as they would need to if they were to be successful&#13;
in finding uew markets. -In Taiwan, among thc seven sources of export&#13;
market-information about which garment exporters were asked in the survey&#13;
mentioned carlier in this section, government export promotion agencies&#13;
were rated as the least useful of all (Table 6.1 ahove).     In Colombia,&#13;
not one of the 30 firms that we interview ' rodited an overseas office&#13;
of lROEXI'O with having founld it a buyer.  The Bogota office of REoXPO&#13;
does nerlorm a iiseftil m:lrketing fuinction, however, in direc:ing foreign&#13;
btuyers who need assistance to appropriate potential supplying firms.&#13;
PROEXPO is also invaluable in providing almost iin1imited export credi'&#13;
1. The perceived risk involved in cxporting in Colombia is pairticularly&#13;
great for small firms, as is cxemplified by the case of a womanl from&#13;
a small town who runs a second embroidery-based putting-out operation&#13;
(not to be :onfused with the one mentioned in Chapter 3). In 1970,&#13;
this woman displayed her wares at the Bogota International Fair and&#13;
received a highly remuncrative offer from the agent of a major European&#13;
chain of stores.   But she was afraid of getting involvecl with what&#13;
was, to her, an unknown purchaser in a far away cotintry; so    after&#13;
some consideration   she rejected the offer.   The European concern&#13;
now buys its embroidered blouses outside Colombia.&#13;

-Lord Chesterfield, Letters, 1750.&#13;
Once the prospec.ive exporter has located a potential foreign buyer,&#13;
or vice versa, the huyer is likelv to want evidence that the garment maker&#13;
is reasonahly aware of worldl fashion trends.  It is not necessary that the producer&#13;
should he up to the minute in fashion - that is the buyer's job.   But he&#13;
should be aware enough of what is selling, and of what is and is not&#13;
aeceptahle in world markets, to enable him to respond flexibly and quickly&#13;
to the buyer's requests without these having to be spelled out in inordinate&#13;
detail.  Although a number of Colombian garment executives have no trouble&#13;
at all in passing this test, the huyers with whom I spoke in New York rated&#13;
I.ast Asian managers, many of whiose firms live almost entirely from exports,&#13;
ahead of Colombians on average.   As the chief purchiaser of women's apparel&#13;
for one New York department store explained:&#13;
If I visit Korean and Taiwanese firms, their lines are up to&#13;
date with U.S. andi Eu.opean fashions.  If I visit a Colombian&#13;
-       firm, T often have to start by telling them what sold well in&#13;
the llnited States last year.  Then I have to suggest changes&#13;
in the products that they are offering   and supervise the&#13;
alterathi pio,t .. it all takes muth more time.2)&#13;

Tf a garment is to be of acceptable quality in the U.S. market, it&#13;
must be styled, cut, and sized according to specifications; it must be&#13;
strongly sewn and neatly finished; and the fabric, buttons, linings anld&#13;
other materials of whichi it is made muist he good enough zo pass shrinkage,&#13;
colorfastness and other qua;Ility-control tests.  The best-managed garment-&#13;
making firms in Colombia consistently meet thiese standar(ds - but a number&#13;
of less well manaped compl-anies do not.&#13;
-     The results of some tests thiat were carried out by a large U.S.&#13;
retail chain on apnarel puIrchased in Colombia give some idea of the degree&#13;
of variance in ciuality that can be fouind among some of the less  reliable&#13;
Colombian suppliers.1) Of 22 Colombian garments (mostly chiildrei's wear)&#13;
that were tested by this chalin durinig 1976-77,13 were judged to be unsatis-&#13;
factory; on threce, follaw-':1' information was required; three were satisfact&#13;
with qualificationis; and only three were clearly satisfactory. That is,&#13;
of the 22 items examined, 59 percent were rejected outright and only 14&#13;
percent were clearly acceptable.   By comparison, apparel from East Asia&#13;
that was tested by the samu quality control department dtiring 1976-78&#13;
1.  This chain operates at the low-to-medium price cnd of thc apparel marke&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -&#13;
generally had a rejection rate of 10, or at worst 20. percent.&#13;
The types of quality problems that this and other II.S. buyers have&#13;
cncountered with Colombian garments covcr a broad spectrtim.&#13;
* A maker of chiltiren's jeans did not have any small zippers in&#13;
stock, so he cut off the ends of some larger ones and used these instead.&#13;
The zippers broke and the entire $25o000 shipment was worthless.&#13;
*     * V/hen some children's pants were washed in washing machines they&#13;
shrank more than was tolerable   andl U.S. custome;- began retuirning them&#13;
to the stores.   The mantifacturcr's response was "tell them to wash the&#13;
peants by hland."  (Ilouschold-owncd washinc machines are lecs comnmon in Cnlomhi&#13;
than in the United States; many utpper-income Colombian families employ&#13;
live-in maids who wash clothlcS b)y ) hand.)&#13;
* Ihc stripe on the shoulder of a boy's cotton sports slhirt lost&#13;
its color in the wash.  h'lec manijf'acttirer suggested that the shirt be&#13;
labolled ''drV-clt*an only".&#13;
* The lining within the collar of somc cor(diroy shi rts was poorly&#13;
constructed, with the result that the gairments lost their attractiveness&#13;
after two or three washes.   The manufacturer was not willing to change&#13;
his prodluction process for itist one ctistomer.&#13;
* The sizing o a-litimber of shipments of women's blouses was not&#13;
accurate, so the buyer scourei Colombia for a free -rice patternmaker&#13;
who was familiar withi U.S. sizeCs.)  lvcrttial ly he found one, but even&#13;
this person did not possess the necessary mannerquiins and tools.   In Korea&#13;
and Taiwan, inanypatternmakers specialize solely in work for the U.S.&#13;
market.&#13;
1. Colombian firms thlat have licensing agreements witth foreign companies&#13;
receive sizing information and assistance from their licensors, but&#13;
the small firm in question had no such agreemcnt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
As can he inferred from these instances, some Colombian garment&#13;
exporters simply do not understand the requiremcints of thc U.S. market.&#13;
Zippers that break, pants than shrink excessively, colors that rin, collar&#13;
linings that wrinkle, sizes that arc incorrect - none of these is acceptable.&#13;
True, hand-washing or dry-cleaning coul(d solve some of these problems - but&#13;
American consumers are not intcrested in children's pants that have to be&#13;
washIed by hand or boys' shirts that have to be dry-cleaned.  As one buyer&#13;
complained: "They were trying to sell us what they've always sold in&#13;
Colombia instead of adjusting to U.S. requirements." This buyer cancelled&#13;
-a Colombian apparel-purchasing program-of a million dollars a year as a result&#13;
of quality control problems with two or three firms; her department store now&#13;
buys the cancelled items in East Asia.&#13;
At least some officials in Colombia seem to be aware of the quality&#13;
control problem.  In a speech in Bogota in late 1978, the Miniktcr of&#13;
Development used almost the same language as the New York bhuyer:&#13;
E.ven though it is painful to admit it, we are inexpert at&#13;
international marketing . ..we have thoughlt, wrongly, that we&#13;
could simply export what was left over.1)&#13;
Nor, it might be added, are Colombians alone in sometimes misjudging the&#13;
markets to which they sell.   Accordling to a trade newspaper of the New&#13;
York garment indu'try, West German retailers believe that the tJ.S.-made&#13;
otiterwear that is offered by hopeful U.S. garment-exporters featiures colors and&#13;
styling that are not in tUInC with German taste is of poor quality and is "madc&#13;
to last only a very short tine"; and is not adapted in sizing and fit to&#13;
the CGerman figure.2)&#13;

Before leaving the subject of quality control, a tangentially-&#13;
related example of lack of attention to detail in finishin,g export-related&#13;
products is worth mentioning.   PROEXPO (1978a) publishes an attractively-&#13;
designed, glossy D)irectory of Exporters each year, the main funiction of&#13;
which, presumably, is to serve as the central source of information on&#13;
export supply availabilities for prospective foreign buyers. But on&#13;
close inspection, the long lists of firms that export garments that are&#13;
included in the Directory fail to include fuily one-third of the firms&#13;
in our sample, including two of the top four exporters   and six companies&#13;
that have been exporting continuously at least since 1974.    Further, the&#13;
English translation of the introdu,ctory informatir.- in the 1978 D)irectory&#13;
is puire Spanglisjh in parts,and it includes three typographical errors, one&#13;
covering two lines, on the first page. )&#13;

Delivery dates are mtich more irportant in the 11.S. market than in&#13;
Colombia, Venezuela and the Laribbean because seasonal variations in fashion a]&#13;
climate, and hence in tthe clothing that is saleable, are more marked in&#13;
the llnited States. A Il.S. department store buyer who orders shirts for&#13;
delivery in March is quite likely to cancel the order if they have not&#13;
arrived by April 1, because after that date they can only be sold at a&#13;

of the same Directory as the population from whiich he drew his sample&#13;
of exporters. but he foundl that many of the firms that were selected&#13;
had to ho discarded because they were not currently exporting.   In a&#13;
second example of inadequate quality of informaition about exporters&#13;
and ey ort products. Bernhart reports that ;when he visited the Nintli&#13;
Bogota International Trade Fair posing as a buiyer for a Boston import&#13;
house, only four of the sixteen apparel and leather prodticts firms wilose&#13;
stalls he approached were able to provide him with dollar prices; and&#13;
the two sets of samples that he ordered were never dteliveredl.&#13;

discount of 40 or 50 percent.   Since replacerinct merchandise is not always&#13;
immetliately available, the floor space that was set asidc for the cancelled&#13;
order may be underutilized,and the money that waIs spent o01 newspaper advertising&#13;
may be wastedl.  it takes only two or three episodes like this for a department&#13;
storc btuyer to lose his job %- hich ielps to explain why buyers attach so much&#13;
importance to deliverv dates.&#13;
Some of the U.S. buvers whom I interviewed expressed total satisfaction&#13;
with the punctuality recordls of thieir Colombian suippliers; but many were less&#13;
than satisfied on this score, and several indicated that the failtire of some&#13;
Colombian suLppli-ers to teliver goodls on time was the last straw that caused&#13;
them to cease purchasing garments in Colombia.   ^ few specific instances may&#13;
help to illustrate thie nature of the problem. A U.S. manufacturer&#13;
of custom-tailored slacks said that it Costs him SS&#13;
more tollave his trouserc milade in the Ilnited States than in Colombia, but&#13;
that the increased reliabilitv of delivery is woitth $10 more to his customers.&#13;
A U.S. importer-wholes:ler who tried to specialize in Colombian appiarcl found&#13;
thlat he eventuallv lost most of his U.S. customers becauise of the unpunctuality&#13;
of some of his suppliers.   A department store chiain ordered 100,000 jackets&#13;
from a large Colombian firm, trimmed the order to SC,OO0 when the supplier&#13;
ran into difficnIlties, then cut it to 5,000 - "and in the. end they didi not&#13;
even deliver five :amnle c.  r would never fgo hack to then,'' mv informant&#13;
stated ,"and that experienice turniedi me off (.olombia."  A second department&#13;
store chaini seit .. buyilng mission to Colombia, hut the few orders thait they&#13;
placed we'rC never delivered.  '   bl, buyers would hbe wary of going to Colombia&#13;
again:` It was a sheer w:aste of o,,r time."&#13;
I. Thc reverse seems to occuir as well; onc of our infornmants claiimed that his&#13;
U.S. btuyer h;as promoted to Merchandising Manager as a reward for ru idiig&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -&#13;
As is the case with quality control, at least some officials in Colombia&#13;
seem to be aware of the punctuality problem. Referring to the punctuality&#13;
with which both samples and finishcd garments arc delivered (as well as to&#13;
the degrec to which both of these conform to thc initial specifications) PROEXPO&#13;
(1978b, p. 30) states:  "'Ihc Colombian image that hals been crcated with&#13;
respect to attention to the clicnt is quite discredited."&#13;
The most important single determinant of the degree to which a garment-&#13;
exporting firm is able to maintain quality control standards aa.d to deliver&#13;
goods on time is the quality of its managemcnt.   Thus, it is no coinci(dence&#13;
that several of the Colombian companies that have often delivered unacceptable&#13;
garments have also often delivered late -- whiereas the firnms that almost&#13;
always maintain high quality standardIs are the same ones that almost always&#13;
deliver on time.  But a firm does not exist in isolation from its environment;&#13;
some problerrs that are external to the individual cnterprise can tax, :tnd(&#13;
occasional! v defeat, even the hest managers.&#13;
IPROBLEMS WITI I POME.STIC I NPtrIS&#13;
The protection that Cnlombian textile producers receive against competition&#13;
from imports not only enables them to charge high prices for their prodticts:&#13;
it also cnables them to take considerable libertiec with the natture a.d qualitv&#13;
of the fabrics that they supply to garment-makers and with the punctuiality&#13;
with which they deliver.  The complaint of a manager of a medium-sized,&#13;
relatively new pants-making firm illust rates the problem:&#13;
We asked for three different shades of brown cordiuLov - but in the&#13;
first month they sent IIs only back. TIhen thev sent us all black&#13;
and a bit of bright red.   They sent us colors that are not even&#13;
in their catalog.  We asked fcor A grade Iexpiort  ul ity] ; they&#13;
sent us B grade - look, it's writtc.. on tihe label.  We orderedi&#13;
6,00() meters a month - they sometimes sendf us only 2,sOO meters.&#13;
They just send uIs whatever they like, wt ~never thlc like.  IIow&#13;
can we possibly export like that?&#13;
The manager of a second pants-mnaking firm reported similar experiences:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
If we cotuld rely on local suppliers of fabric we would mnuch&#13;
prefer to use it instead of exportin   tiunder 807 as we do now -&#13;
but we've had terrible problems with the textile firms.   We&#13;
ordered 100,000 meters of indigo denim in December for delivery&#13;
in June.  By Julv only 1,000 meters had come.   Now it's December&#13;
and we've still only received a third of it.   We ordered 20,000&#13;
meters of corduroy - none of it arrived. We had to run around&#13;
looking for substitute fabrics ... you can't export like that.&#13;
These were two of the worst cases that we cane across, but they were far&#13;
from being the only ones. Fully half of the domestic fabric-using garment&#13;
makers whom we interviewed complained that the quantities, qualities or&#13;
colors of fabric that thiey received were sometimes different from what they&#13;
had ordered, and thiat the fabrics that dtid arrive were often weeLs&#13;
or months late.  As might be expected, newer and smaller firms tended to&#13;
have more cowplaints on this score tL:an large, long-established companies.&#13;
BAR [RERS TO IMPORT I NC TNPUIS&#13;
The garment-makers' solution to problems like these, and to fabric over-&#13;
pricing as well, would seem to be to import fabric from abroad. In llong Kong,&#13;
Korea and Taiwan, g..;ment exporters have guaranteed access to imported&#13;
fabrics on virtually free trade terms. In Colombia, the Vallejo Plan draw-&#13;
back scheme appears to offer similar access - but, in practice, several steep&#13;
barriers have to be overcome.&#13;
Vallejo Plan&#13;
According to officials of TINOMEX, a company wisthing to uise the Vallejo&#13;
Plan has to wait a miilimtum of two, and an average of three or four,weeeks unltil&#13;
its application is approved.  The average delay is comnosed of a week for&#13;
presttdy, a week tintil thie committee meets, a week for signatures, stamps,&#13;
etc., and a week until the apprnval is registered and received by the firm.&#13;
The delay can extend heyond a month if a relevant INCOMIX officirl is abroad;&#13;
if the petitioning companv has to make a lact-minute change in the specifications&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
of the fabric that it wishes to import; or if an official decides to return&#13;
the form to the petitioner because it contains a spelling or punctuation&#13;
error (several garment export2rs reportcd( in annoyance that this had happened&#13;
to them).&#13;
These pre-approval delays are not the only problems inherent in the&#13;
operation of the Vallejo Plan as it stcnds. Equally serious, anvone wishing&#13;
to import a fabric that is made by a Colombian textile company(ind particularly&#13;
denim or corduroy)has to produce a letter from that companv stating that it&#13;
is unable to supply the fabric in the required quantity and quality by the&#13;
required date.  But, as several of our interviewees pointed out, any g,rment-&#13;
maker who asks the textile companies for a letter like this risks having his&#13;
name placed oji their blacklist, and thus risks jeopardizing all of his future&#13;
local supplies. )   Better, in the view of many, to put up with unreliablc&#13;
supplies than to be cut off altogether.&#13;
All thing,. considered, the operation of the Vallejo Plan could certainly&#13;
be worse: it seems that little or no briberv is involved, for instance, and&#13;
many garment riakers whom we interviewed went out of their way to praise&#13;
IN(:OMLX for doing a relatively good job. But when the competition is able&#13;
to import fabric under free trade conditions, the delays inherent in the&#13;
Vallejo Plan as it cuirrently operates undoubtedly place Colombian suppliers&#13;
tinder a handicap.&#13;
Ports and cuistoms&#13;
Once approval to import inputs has been granted and the goods reach&#13;
the Colombian ports, they routinely encounter delays that are caused bv&#13;
1.  PROEXPO has recognized this problem,too. "Althougih imports of tc:;tiles&#13;
are permitted, few garmennt-makers have taken advantuge of thic possibility.&#13;
This is because they fear the reaction of the textile firms on whom they&#13;
depend for their regular supplies."   (PROEXPO, 1978b, p.12).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I5S) -&#13;
congestion, labor disptites, and thie slow clealrinig of storehouscs.  After&#13;
thiat, a final hurdle still has to he sulmountedi: customs.  In the Dominican&#13;
Republic, where inost garmient exports take piace uindlcr the U.S. 807 scheme,&#13;
clearing imported merchansise takes 24 holors.  In Taiwan, it takes two or&#13;
three davs.  In t'olombia, according to numcrous accounlt.;, it takes two to&#13;
foutr weeks - and often involves bruiery,  theft, and rain-damage to the&#13;
goods to boot. Indleed, the problems involvedl in clearing imported goods&#13;
throuigh customs probably provide almost as muich protection to the Colombian&#13;
textile manufacturers as the rest of the tariff and li,ensing system pvc&#13;
togethier. This is so because the customs problems affect Val lejo Plan and&#13;
807 impclrts as well as ordinary imports, and bccausc they introduice a new&#13;
andl important elemilent of risk Into the business of imp,orting.  Once agaill,&#13;
perhaps the simplest way to give an idea of what is involved is to let some&#13;
of the persons concerined speak for themsielves.&#13;

like the following were in  the minority.   A Colombian Jacket-maker:&#13;

I finally got the goods after three months, but most of them&#13;
had been ruined by the rain.   Of course,L lost that order and&#13;
the client. Now, even thloughi it costs me more, I buy all my&#13;
inputs locally.&#13;
A Colombian jacket-assembler:&#13;
We refused to bribe the customs officers,so it took us 1½ months&#13;
to get the goods [imported under 807]   out of customs. Mien we&#13;
finally got them, 274 jackets were useless because the box&#13;
containing their collars had been stolen.   We lost the contract&#13;
and the client.&#13;
A U.S. importer-wholesaler:&#13;
I had ten tons of piece-goods on the tarmac. All the licences&#13;
were in order, but some customs guy wanted to open it all to&#13;
examine the buttons. I had a licence for *olyester buttons;&#13;
he wanted to make sure that they were polyk-ter and not acrylic.&#13;
I ask you, who cares?  It took him a we, -. find the right&#13;

A lJ.S. importer-manufacturer:&#13;
Our supplicr is one of the biggest apparel firms in Colombia,&#13;
but thev still routinely wait three to six weeks to get goodis&#13;
out of ecistoms.  Six weeks is half of our season!&#13;
A Colombian government official:&#13;
If you are importing goods from abroad, you have to expect&#13;
that up to 50 percent of them will he stolen; but usually&#13;
it's more like ten percent. The gangc of thieves seem to&#13;
have worked out that ten percent is enough to make stealing&#13;
wortlhwhile, but not so much that people will complalni.&#13;
Free Zones&#13;
The one way ir. hich garment-makers who wish to import fabric and&#13;
other inputs can avoid the delays inherent hoth in the V'allejo Plan and&#13;
in clearing goods through customs is by setting up operations in an F[xport&#13;
Processing Zone or, as they are kno,-n in Colombia, a Free Zone (Zona Franca).&#13;
Hong Kong, of course, is one giant Free Zone. Tn Taiwanii, more than $30()&#13;
million worth of garment exports a year and a sixth of all gazrment industrv&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -&#13;
employment stem from the country's lree Zones. )    Yet in Colombia, where&#13;
one might expect them to be so useful in ovcrcoming the problems associated&#13;
with importing, Free Zones seem to have been a failure.&#13;
From the viewpoint of industrial production and export,&#13;
the two most ii.,ortant lree Zones in Colombia are located at the&#13;
scaport in Barranquilla and at the P'almaseca Airport outsidle Cali.   In the&#13;
Barranqu;illa Zone, total garment exports never exceeded $4 million gross&#13;
(or S1.2 million net of importecl inptits) ija any year through 1978 (Table o .);&#13;
total garment industry employment never exceeded 1,80() persons; andl only&#13;
five garment firms were prodiuicing for export in 1978.    At the Palmaseca&#13;
airport  the situationi is even bleaker; with the closing of a large foreign-&#13;
owned company in about 1977, there are Inow apparently nio important garment&#13;
exporters left in the Zone at all.&#13;
Wihy have not tile (.olombian FICe Zones attracted and retained more&#13;
garment-exporting firms?   Firct o'. all, both the Barranquilla and Cali&#13;
Zones are locatold quite some distance from the area;s in which thleir workers&#13;
live, which mcans that companics locating in them inctir extra costs of&#13;
transport and provision of food.   Since it probably costs considerably&#13;
less to transport goods once each way than to transport the entire labor&#13;
forece back and forth each day, it may make sense to follow the example&#13;
1. Scott (1979) Tanbe 'I. I above, and Republic of China, Monthly Biml1Ctin&#13;
of Labor St;t.istics, .Junc 197S, Table 1-.&#13;
2. Taking all industries into account, the Barranquilla Zone accounted for&#13;
80 to 90 percent of total Colombian Free Zone production, employment,&#13;
exports, and value added in exports in 1977; the Palmaseca Zone accounted&#13;
for between 10 and 20 percent; the Buenaventura Zone accouinted for less&#13;
than one percent; and the Zones at Cartageina and Clucuta were confined&#13;
alniost entirely to commercial activities (Ichaxarria, 1979, alable li-3).&#13;

concerned.   (True, .nis argument  loes not apply to Palmaseca - huit thc&#13;

drawback).   It we-   be interesting to see wh.thier a Free Zone located&#13;
near the airport (land near worker houising) in MclelliTl or Bogota might&#13;
not havc better -iicecss.  Finally, although I have no information on the&#13;

have had sometiling to do withl the 1.one's lack of success.  These explanations&#13;

.lAD AND C(YC: I l TIMES&#13;
hlie le-i,i time facing a buiyer is the tine that elapses between placing&#13;
an order an(d receiving the linishc(i garments: the cvclc time, for a buyer&#13;
who uses the assembly sxstem, is the time between (despIatch ing the precut&#13;
I. Scott (1979).&#13;

probl ems iit h cuistorm; and thlft in the I rec Toncs at prrtsent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
fabric and receiving the fully-assembled apparel.    Because fashions change&#13;
so abruptly and so frequently in the garment businecs, the shorter the&#13;
lead and cycle times that a country is able to offer, the more likely it&#13;
is to succeed in exporting.&#13;
U.S. buyers who use U.S. apparel firms to assemble their gar'ments&#13;
can generally count on cycle times of two to three weeks. (Tlhis means that&#13;
a U.S. manufacturer who sends one set of precut inputs to a II.S. assemblcr&#13;
and flies a second identicdl set to a Colombian rival is likely to have&#13;
the localiv-assembled finished garments in his warehouses. readv for sale,&#13;
before the Colombian firm has got its inputs out of customs.) For imports,&#13;
the acceptable cycle time is generally about six to eight weeks. For imports&#13;
from Colombia, however, the cycle time is usuially ten weeks or more.    This&#13;
delay is composed of at least two weeks until the import is approved by&#13;
INCO,EX,at least two weeks to get the imported materials out of customs and&#13;
into the factory, five weeks in the factory, and one week to get the finished&#13;
garments back to the United States.   Ftirther, it is not uncommon   for another&#13;
week or two to be added because of longer-than-minimum delays in approval&#13;
of the import or in customs, or because the finished goods have to wait to&#13;
get on a flight.   Thus, as a result of the delays involved in thc administration&#13;
of the Vallejo Plan and in customs clearance, the one important potential&#13;
advantage that Colombian garment exporters have over their rast Asian rivals&#13;
is lost. Instead of being several weeks shorter, either the lead andl cycle&#13;
times that Colombians can offer U.S. huyers are the same as those offcred by&#13;
East Asians or,in many cases, they are one or two weeks longer.     'Sf couLrsu,&#13;
for the 20 percent of East Asian garment exports that travel to the United&#13;
States by air, the time differential is considerably greater again.&#13;

EXPORT FORMALITIES&#13;
As a result of the Customs Department reforms of 1974, up to twelve&#13;
signatures now have to appcar on each export manifest. These signatures&#13;
attest that  the goods exist; they have enterecd the storchouse; they are mad&#13;
of the materials that are stated on the manifest (two signatures are needed&#13;
for tis, including one of an auditor); the transporter has seen the goods;&#13;
they hiave left the storehouse; they have  been placed on the plane; and the&#13;
export has been authorized. *rhe aim of having so many signatures is, of&#13;
course, to reduce fictitious exports to a minimum.     lhe effect, unfortumat'&#13;
ic to add a little more to Colombian lead and cycle times, and also to add a&#13;
little to the cost of exporting; most large exporters maintain from one to&#13;
three full-time employees whose sole function is dealing with these for,nalit&#13;
RANGE OF FABR ICS AND GARMENTS&#13;
A IJ.S. buyer of rants or shirts wants to be able to buy all of the&#13;
merchandise that he needs in one country or at Ieast on one business trip;&#13;
he is likely to try to avoid importing corduroy pants from one continent&#13;
and polyester-cotton trousers from another.   Tin ast Asia, as many buvers&#13;
stated, you can get any garment that you want, madie of any matcrial:   cotton&#13;
synthetics, wool, leather, ftir -- you name it, they can do it. In Colombia,&#13;
by contrast, the range of available fabrics, and hence garmesis, is extremell&#13;
limited. Colombian denim and corduroy are of good quality if highi price;&#13;
but almost any other fabric has to be imported.   Thlis means that, insofar&#13;
as the use of domestic fabric is concerned, Colombia is a possible source fob&#13;
1. Despite this elaborate system of checks, some fictitious exports still&#13;
seem to slit) through. lor example, the exports of cheese th,.t were&#13;
registered in Santa Niarta in late 1978 were apparently considerably&#13;
greater in value than total local cheese.production.&#13;

ciustoms clearance mean that Colombia is effectively .Ieniecl duty-free access&#13;
to Japanese fabric wh'ich , in the mid-1970's, was one of the world's premier so&#13;

The resultinig narrowness in the range of exportable fabrics and garments that&#13;
aIrC av'ailable reinforces somc of the country's other marketing problems:&#13;
Colombia is a relatively unattractive seiarce of apparel, so vuyers visit&#13;
infrequienitly and refrain from establ ishinp permanent offices, so Colombian&#13;
clothin(g firms findi .&#142;xportinig risky and concentrate on selling domestically,&#13;

Some government officials to whom wC talked gulessed that Colombias's&#13;
clothitig exports to the lJnited States miglht have done relatively poorly&#13;
because tJ.S. import quotas held them back.  In fact, this does not seem to&#13;
have becn the case.&#13;
In eacil of the two most recent ll.S.-Colombia bilateral textile&#13;
agreements, the apparel section contalinis over 60 separate categories.&#13;

less tlhan 10 percent of thc allotted quota was utilized.  Of thc 21 cotton&#13;
categories in the agreemcnt, there was not one in which thc quota was cven&#13;
one-third filled.  Overall, there were only four categories in 1975/76 and&#13;
two in 1976/77 in which the quota allotment was at least two-thirds&#13;
filled  (Table  6.4).    By way of comparison, Korea utilized at least&#13;
85 percent of its quota allotments   in  23  categories  in 1975/76,&#13;
while the Philippinies (15),  Taiwan (13),  and [long Kong  (11, including&#13;
several broadly-bracketed categories) have all come much closer&#13;
to utilizing their quotas than Colombia (Table 6.5).&#13;
Nevertheless, in two categories, the U.S. quota does seem to have&#13;
become a binding constraint. One is men's and boys' suits of wool, the&#13;
other is women's blouses, not knit, of man-made fibers. )   In the first&#13;
of these, as noted earlier, one large firm accounlts for over 90 percent&#13;
of all Colombian shipments to the United Stat.2s; in the second, two firms,&#13;
both using the 807 scheme, share a similarly large proportion of U.S.-&#13;
bound exports. ) The managers of these threce firms all indicated (and&#13;
their U.S. buyers confirmed) that they would have been able to export&#13;
more to the UJnited States in 1978 but for thc limitations imposed by the&#13;
quota. ) None of these firms showed any signs of diversifying into&#13;
product areas in which quota is not yet binding.&#13;

Not content to rely on quotas, in late 1978 thc United States&#13;
threatened to impose      countervailiing duties of 2.1l&amp; percentage points&#13;
on Colombia's clothing exports, allegedly to offset unfair subsidv&#13;
elements in the CAT. An alternative solution that has proposed was that&#13;
the Colombian government should reduce thIe nominal CAT recei'edI by&#13;
exporters of clothing to the IJnite(I States ,y 2.15 percentage points.&#13;
Either way, the end result was likely to be to reduce still further the&#13;
profitability of exporting to thc United States.&#13;
Up to the time of writing, the European Economic Community had not&#13;
yet imposed quotas on imports of clothing from Colombia, because&#13;
those imports had never yet reached significant levels.&#13;
The fact that quotas hav., not yet severely hampered Colombia's&#13;
clothing exports to the lInited States and Europe except in two sub-sectors&#13;
does not mean, of course, that quota coul(d not become 3 problem in the&#13;
future. On the contrary, if exporting to world markets were to become&#13;
profitable, the low levels of quotas for exports to the United States&#13;
and the relatively low import levels at which consultations are triggered&#13;
in the Colombia-E.E.C. textile agreements could become rea' restrictioins.1)&#13;

United States to increase at least threc or fourfold withiin the&#13;
existing quotas if - a big if - these quotas could be more full)&#13;
utilized.&#13;

MARKl TI\G rizornrs&#13;
For most goods these days, from a loaf of bread to an oiince of&#13;
marijuana, only a smalil proportion of the price that tne final consumer&#13;
pavs finds its way to the original producer.     F lor garments exportecd from&#13;
Colombia to the United States, the sittiation is no different. Assuming,&#13;
as is common, that transport costs are about five percent of the Colombian&#13;
;.o.b. price, that the U.S. importer's mark-up is 33 percent, and that the&#13;
-       ~~~2)&#13;
U.S. retailer's mark-up iS 100 percent, az Colombian garment-cxporting firm&#13;
using domestic fabric generally receives between a quarter and a third of&#13;
the price that is paid by the U.S. consumer (Table 6.6).&#13;
If the 807 scheme is iused, the proportion cc the consumer price that&#13;
is received by the Colombian garment exporter is still lower. For example,&#13;
one companv receives $3.65 for a jacket that retails in the U1nited States&#13;
for $60; a second receives 55 on a coat retailing for $45-$65. One reason&#13;
for these apparently extremelv low returns to 807 sales is that the exporting&#13;
firm receives payment only for the labor that it providles (but of course it&#13;
does not have to pay for the fabric that it uses).   A second reason is that,&#13;
1.  In marijiana, it has been estimated that a mere three percent of the&#13;
U S. retail price is received by Colombians (.Junguito and Caballero,&#13;
1978; Niedergang, 1979).&#13;
2.  Ir the U.S. garment industry, the importer's markup is generally&#13;
stated as 25% (of the price to the retailer), while the retailer's&#13;
markup is genierally stated as 5O% (of the price to the consumer).&#13;
The difference, of course, is only a matter of perspective.&#13;
3. f'lhe price that is paid tly the consutmer' is not always unambiguous.&#13;
The manager of one Colombian clothing firm showed us some computer-&#13;
compatible price tags whicih he had just received from his buver in&#13;
the United States, and which he was about to attach to his finished&#13;
jackets.  Ihe typed price of S120 had been crossed otit on these tags;&#13;

because U.S. retailers usually prefer not to get involved in 80/, firms&#13;
that choose or are forced to export under 807 have to go through an extra&#13;
middleman (the importer-wholesaler or importer-manufacturer who conducts&#13;
the 807 operation) instead of being able to sell directiv to the depart-&#13;
ment stores that eventually sell most of their goods (Fig. 6.1).1)&#13;
Before examining ways in which Colombian garment exnorters might&#13;
increase the share of the U.S. consumer price that they receive, it is&#13;
useful to look at a marketing schema developed by the Wortzels. Generalizing&#13;
from a study of East and Southeast Asian exports, the Wortzels (1979) argue&#13;
that exporting firms in developing countries tend to rass through five&#13;
distinct stages of marketing capabilitv.   In Stage 1, the firm is discovered&#13;
by an importer who is searching for new sources of supply.    Ihe importer&#13;
makes all decisions with respect to prodiuct specifications; the exporter&#13;
simply sells producti'. capacitv. In Stage II, the firm starts to search&#13;
for importers to whom it can sell.   ft also begins to develop some internal&#13;
design capability and to establish a rudimentary sales anti marketing&#13;
organization. By Stage III, the search for potential importers has&#13;
broadened ant become more systemitic.   The firm's principals make frequent&#13;
trips abroad and may open overseas liaison and information-transmitting&#13;
offices.  The firm begins to participate in the determination of prodtict&#13;
specifications   and is able to show at Ieast a rudimentary product line&#13;
of its own (e.g. men's shirts in a variety of styles and colors).     In&#13;
the big leap to Stnge TV, the firm makes the transition from marketer&#13;
1. Tn men's shirts, for instance, department stores are responsible&#13;
for 58 percent of total U.S. retail sales volume; men's specialty stores&#13;
( iS   percent) and discount shor)s  (S percent) account for most&#13;
of the remainder (International Trade Center, c1977).&#13;

of procluctionl capacity to producer and marketer of its own products  to&#13;
its own specifications.   It takes responsibility for shipping the product&#13;
to thc dcstination conntry  and for distribution to wholesalers or retailers&#13;
within that country.    It begins to tise its own brand names rather than&#13;
those of its buyers  and starts to advertise and promotc its produicts&#13;
abroadl. IT may set tip its own overseas warehousing system.  By Stage V,&#13;
thic firm has hecome undistinguishalic from competing companies in the&#13;
country to hhich it sells.   Its strategy is to differentiate its products&#13;
by branding, clistinctive styling, and so forth.&#13;
fn terms of this schema, a Colombian firm that wishes to increase&#13;
its share of the price paid hy the consumer has to make the transition&#13;
from Stage IIl, in which it sells to an importer of some kind, to Stage IV,&#13;
in which it takes responsibility for shipping the product to the destination&#13;
country and for distribution within that country.   Although the prospect&#13;
of making such a transition is clearly an attractive one, as thC t'ortzels&#13;
point otit, it also involves considerablei risks.  tlhercas thc Stage III firm&#13;
reccives (designs from its clients, produices onlv to cuistomers' orders, and&#13;
is paidi Lhrough irrevocable letter of crelit at the time of shipment, the&#13;
Stage TV enterprise stands or falls on the basis of its own design capability,&#13;
produces for inventory, and sells on open account.   I:ven in Fast Asia, only&#13;
a handful of the l.argest garmcnt firms have made the transition to Stage TV&#13;
for exports to thie United States; ill Colombia, nor!nC of the firms in t2 sample&#13;
has yet dlone so.  True, two Colombian firms have occasionally exportetd goods&#13;
of their own specifications to the United Stattcs and t'ave sometimes sold items&#13;
whicih hear their own names as well as thc.  ot thieir clients (this has mostly&#13;
OCCLirredi in linies ilke women's dresses in which brand namcs are less important).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
But onlly two or three of the garment-makers that we interviewed hIave&#13;
advertised thieir products in thc Unitcd States, and none has established a&#13;
U.S. warchousing or distribution system.&#13;
The fate of the one Colombian firm in our sample that has made a&#13;
serious attempt to break through into Stage IV for exports to the Unitcd&#13;
states and Europe illustrates just how difficult this transition can be.&#13;
The main business of the company in question is making not garments but&#13;
yarn. As a way of promoting the tlse of their yarns, the firm's managers&#13;
hit on the idea of trying to revive the fashion snona women of wearing&#13;
haind-embroidered garmncilts. Their idea was not only to sell such garments&#13;
themselves  but,also to encoulrage women in the United States and Europe to&#13;
buiy the company's yarns and to do their own embroidering. To these ends,&#13;
they created a subsidiary company, employed over 1,000 embroiderers, set up -&#13;
stands at several trade fairs, and produced an attractive glos.;v brochure&#13;
containing color photographs of come of their products. lIv late l)7R,&#13;
after two years of trying, they had had a great deal of success in the domestic&#13;
mark:t. but their total exports of embroidery-related goods amounted to less&#13;
than $20,000. Thley were finding that it is not easy for one Colombian firm,&#13;
no mattcr    how large, to create or revive  a fas,hion abroad; that duties&#13;
of 35 percent and more on imports of embroidered garments cauise their prolucts&#13;
to be high-pricedl in the Ulnited States; that it is difficult to find a way&#13;
of selling directly to boutiques (the natural outlCt) .ccaMisC this type of&#13;
store dGos not generally import goods directly itself: and that O-Tce their&#13;
products finallv get into a store thev tend to be displayed next to machine-&#13;
cmbroidered garments from Tndia,which are apparently identical in the eves&#13;
of most customers but which sell for a fraction of the price.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 170 -&#13;
By contrast with the situation for cxports to thc UInited States, in&#13;
domestic sales and in exports to the Margarita Islan)ds and the Caribbean,&#13;
many Colombian clothing firms have attained, or are approaching, the Wvort:el&#13;
Stage IV or even Stage V    status.  In thcse rmarkets, most firms use their&#13;
own original or copied designs   and sell under their own (or licensed) bran(&#13;
names rather than under those of their buvers.   Some firms acdvcrtise their&#13;
products: a nimber have their own warchousilIg or di;tribution systems.&#13;
For dorestic sales, many of the largest firms own their own chain of&#13;
stores and a large proportion of the others bypass the wholesale stage and&#13;
sell directly to retailers. )   Although only a handful of firms have their&#13;
stores for sales in the Islands and the Caribbean, by selling through 'agents&#13;
and coimissionnaires many are able to retain for themselves all but 10 to 3(&#13;
percent of the retail price.   This ability to capture a large fraction of ti&#13;
serketing profits is thus another attraction of exporting to the Islands anc&#13;
the Caribbean; when added to the high retail prices that rule in these markc&#13;
holps to explain why some Colombian garment exporters routinely earn profits&#13;
30 percenrt and more there (see e.g. Tahle 3.1 above), far nore than they&#13;
could hope to ea:n on exports to thte (Unitedi States.&#13;
1.  In a recent sttidy of the colombian cloth iiitg market that was conducted&#13;
bv the Corporacioi Finarncicra Popular (1977),24 percent of the garment&#13;
firms surveved mainly sold directly through their own stores, and&#13;
another 48 percent sold directly to retailers.   Ior the MSlec111n&#13;
area, Pelfez (1978) put these two percertages at 1 .; !id ;7 percent&#13;
respectively.  Retail markups in Colormia tend to he considerably&#13;
lower than in the UJnited States - .33-50 percentt or so instead of&#13;
100 percent.&#13;

NON-PRICE PROBLEMS. PROTE:CTION AND) TIL EXCIANGE RATI-&#13;
Many of the non-price problems discussed in this chapter, and especially&#13;
the inadeqjuate performance of many Colombian firms on quality control and&#13;
punctuality of delivery, are relevant not only to the quiestion asked Jn&#13;
Part 2 -of this study - shy hlas Colombia been unable to compete with1 Iast&#13;
Asia in the- difficult markets? - but also to the question posed in lart I -&#13;
why did Colombia's exports of clotlhing to the United States and Lurope&#13;
begin to decline after 1974-75?   Some of the detailed reasons why these&#13;
non-pric-e.problems hiave not yet been solved will he discussed in tie next&#13;
chapter.  But one general,over-iiding poinlt is worth mentioninlg here.  The&#13;
combination of a relatively slow rate of devaluation and continuied hligh&#13;
protection against imports of apparel from abroad has caused selling&#13;
domestically to be significantly more profitable 1ur most Colombian clothlinlg&#13;
firms than sciling to the United States (Trales 5.15-5.16 above).   If&#13;
this profit.bility gal) could be narrowed (whethier by making exportinlg to&#13;
the difficult mairkets more profitable or by reducinig protection against&#13;
imports) more local companies might be indticed or forced to improve their&#13;
performance in these crucial non-price areas, and hen-e enabled to become&#13;
more competitive in exporting to the difficult markets.&#13;

-loist sail, my dear boy, and steer cicar of culttire.&#13;
- Epicurus&#13;
OnIv two or three decades ago, development economists routinely&#13;
discu!;sed the social and cultural determinants of development in some&#13;
detail.1) More recently, the tendency has been to state in a sentence&#13;
that cultural factors are no dloubt of some importance and then to ignore&#13;
them. The latter aplproach, or nun-approach, has grown out or the&#13;
realization that it is difficult to say an thing either quantifiable or&#13;
generalizabie about the relationshin between culture.and development, and&#13;
that it is equally difficult, once cultural barriers to dlevelopment are&#13;
exposed, to do anything to change the situation.   Better, it is felt, to&#13;
concentratc on things that are qurantiFiable and on areas in which changes&#13;
in policy can he effected andl can have some impact, than to ruminate on&#13;
what might have been if things were other than they are. lheeding Epicurus'&#13;
warning would certainly have been the path oV least resistance in the&#13;
present study. Yet the possibility cannot be rejected out of hand that&#13;
cultural factors have been at least partly responsible for the fact that&#13;
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea have had so much more success than Colombia in&#13;
exporting clothing.&#13;
1o investigate the role, if any, that cultural factors play in garuent&#13;
exp)orting, three simple mode!s have been constructed. One of them sets&#13;
out the determinants of labor productivity in garment manufacturing; the&#13;
otlher two analyze the determinants of reliable quality control performance&#13;

Lighly inadequate attenipt, and that the findings that emcrge, no matter how&#13;

A full-fledged study of productivity would need to examine .all of&#13;
these factors, cultural and otherwise, and ought probably to concentrate&#13;
especially on management and how and wh'y it differs across firms and&#13;
a,   scountries. 'T'he aim here is not to attempt such a full-fledged&#13;
study, iiowever, but rather to focus solely on the eight culturally-i ifilienced&#13;
factors'and thieir differen.es across the couLitries that are being studied.&#13;
The reason-for focussing on these variables, tnd these alone, is quite&#13;
simply that, until now, inr studies by economists, they have usually been ign(red.&#13;
. 1.  Because of a long Confucian tradition of respect for auithority,&#13;
the degree to which the work force is susceptible to organization and&#13;
discipline tends to be lhigih in Korea.  For similar reasons, it is also&#13;
quite high in Taiwan and l1ong Kong; btit it is considerably lower in&#13;
Colombia.  Several interviewe.'s in Colombia and New York dlescribe(d instances&#13;
in which Colombian worKers successfully resisted attempts that had been&#13;
mace tn change prodluction1 flows, seating arrangements, or the way in which&#13;
items were sewn. The experience of a Il.S. garment industiy produiction&#13;
engineer is representative.  ThL; man spent two years wor-king as an&#13;
importer-wholesaler witlh a number of Colombian firms trying, mostly in&#13;
vain, to help them to increast, productivity  and thtis to export.  In one&#13;
shirt-making company:&#13;
there were five women making cuffs, each using a different meho(d.&#13;
One of tihem was the mout efficient  so T tried te get thtem all to&#13;
do it that way - but they tlidin't stick toi it.  'I'he five wer- not&#13;
sitting next to each other   so you could( not easilv se'e if there&#13;
was a backlog or biillup of cuiffs - but    y heyt li dol't w,lit to move&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18(o -&#13;
As the engineer pointed out, this could not have happcned in the Unitcd&#13;
States or East Asia. "hliere you just say 'this is how it will bc done,' and&#13;
it is dolne."&#13;
2. iEvidence from physical anthropology suggests that East Asians may&#13;
1)&#13;
indeced havc smaller halnds .rind more slender finigers than Europeans and,&#13;
probably, than South Americans.&#13;
3. East Asians all receive considelrably more gcneralized societal&#13;
training in manuial dexterity than Colombians.  Thc usc of chopsticks&#13;
rather than fork and spoon as food conveyors, the widespread tlse of thc&#13;
abacus, and the precision reqtii.ed in calligraphy all    condlition East&#13;
Asian workers' fingers to hc particularly nimbile.&#13;
4.  In cornnection with the intangibP- assets of workers, it is&#13;
considerably less (liffictilt and less costly to fire an employee in East&#13;
Asia than it is in Colombiai.  Several Colombian managers wliom we&#13;
interviewedl claimed that it is partiy because they have nc effective mcans&#13;
of dis1,tissing a worker who does not ohe? ordlers or who dlocs not work&#13;
hard  hat productivity is low.&#13;
S. From scattere(I vtibal evi(lence, it seemin that many East Asians,&#13;
and especially Koreans, identify qtLiec closely with the company that tihey&#13;
work for; the company, in turn, takes care of many of thcir ne^ds. 1½&#13;
Colombia, by contrast, the relationship between employer and employee is&#13;
kept more at arms length.   One Taiwanese-owned garment-mak-ing enterprise&#13;
that was planning to set tip operations in Barranqumilla began by organizing&#13;
the construction of worker housing on the premises, b;at it was soon force(d&#13;
to give uti the i(dea hecaust- of worker opposition.&#13;
1. Coon (1970, p. 149).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.  It is diffictilt, indeed, to mcastirc empirically thie innate or&#13;
culturallv-conditionted ability of managers to organize their operations&#13;
- yet the fact that for several thousand years Chiina has been one of thc&#13;
most highly and effectively organized societies in the world might give&#13;
-managers iAho have been raised in Chinese or Chinese-infltinced culttires&#13;
at least some advantage in this regard.&#13;
7, 8. Finally, there may well be a considerable differenice across cultures&#13;
in thio pl:ace of moticy iacome or profits in workers' or managers' scales of vAlICs&#13;
relativc to the place of a relaxed and sociable work expcrience, an easy&#13;
life, beitng liked by people etcP1 In several of the instances In wlhich&#13;
Colombian workers resisted changes in their work arrangements, thicy didt&#13;
so even-tholigh tinder the new method they were likely to earn a liiglier&#13;
income. Some workers apparentl) valued their comfort and familiarity.&#13;
with the old ways ahead of the extra money; others feared that iinr!er the&#13;
new svstem thley would have to work mucih harder: while still othiers did&#13;
not want to leave th.- friendily and socials4e work groups of which they&#13;
were a part. Presumably, some manap,,rs might havc had more success in&#13;
overcomirg such oliposition if they had involved their workers more in the&#13;
Drocess of impleic-iting the proposed changes; blut tihe possibility remains&#13;
that, at least for some, the extra income to be earned wotild not have&#13;
been considered stifficient to compensate for the '!islocatioll calused hv the chance,&#13;
For ymanagers, too, the place o'f money, in the scaupe of `,ilies mnlav .e&#13;
of some importance. A mana3 er who values beinp li;ed bv his workers&#13;
may socnetin;?s retreat from proposed productivity-improving changes in the'&#13;
I   In E:ast Asia "the dc.i re to he respecteu  (as a per son wh'o works halrd)&#13;
or "the desire to do one's duty" may be as important ais money income&#13;
in influencing how hard people work.&#13;

more important, ma' not.I)¾nrmigrants who arrive in a country with iittIc&#13;

by Jewish or Lebanese inmigraAts or their .descendants.  (Sticih persons&#13;
almost cer.ainly comprise less than one percent of thc total Colombiar.&#13;

'Ilhe nature of a people's system of valties is relevant not only to the&#13;

in this sectionl of the industry are usually set such that employees who&#13;
finish a standard 14 week training program earn about S4.40-$4.50 an&#13;
hour. Yet one group of workers consiste- ly earns about 30 nercent more&#13;
-than this.  The key distinguiishing characteristic of this group appears&#13;
to be not age, nor sex, nor marital statuts - rather, it is that they are&#13;
Koreans. The Allison study includes Colombian and other Latin American&#13;
workers among its sample, and also includes the results of manual dexterity&#13;
tests by nationality of worker. It is hoped that n Culler roport of its&#13;
findings will be available soon.&#13;
QUALITY CONTROL.&#13;
The percentage of a firm's exported garments that is deemed by buyers&#13;
to be of unacceptable quality depends on the ability of the firm's managers&#13;
and workers to maintain strict quality control and on the depree to which&#13;
they perceive the need to maintain such control.&#13;
The ability of managers and workers to maintain quality control depends,&#13;
like productivity. on the skill and intensitv of work effort of workers&#13;
and managers, and on the quality and maintenance of machinery; hence,&#13;
most of the culttural factors that entered into the determination of&#13;
productivity are relevant to quality control too.   Ability to maintain&#13;
quality control also depends on the quality of the inputs that the firm&#13;
is able to obtain.&#13;
The delgree to which managers and( workers perceive qtuality control&#13;
to be important depends on the extent to which exporting is profitable&#13;
(the more profitable it is, the greater the incentive for owners or&#13;
managers to discover that the strict maintenance of quality control&#13;

Part of tre dlifference betweren ctirrent Colombian anid East As:ia'n&#13;
quality control performance is probab,ly explained b) the lack of ability&#13;
of some Colombian managgers to maintain strict quality standards: this.&#13;
in ttirn, mav be partly a fuinction of the cuitnral factors enumerated&#13;
above.   But cdifferences in the perception ol the needt for qluaility control&#13;
may also be of soine importance.   A comparison of traditional arts and&#13;
crafts indicates, for instancc, th;it micro-lte,prccision and neatness&#13;
of finisih are emphasized more in Chinese and Chinese-intlinenced cultilres&#13;

plans, crisis intervention and so forth. The degree to whiich workers&#13;
are susceptible to organization and discinline enters here too, as does&#13;
the extent to which workers ider,tify themselves with the company and&#13;
hence are willing to work long overtim,e hours to get out an order on&#13;
time if necessary.  The degree of punctuality with which domestic andl&#13;
imported inputs are received and the reliability of freight transport&#13;
services may also be significant.&#13;
The extent to which punctuality of deliverv is perceived to be&#13;
important depends on the extent to which exports are profitable (again,&#13;
the more profitable exporting is, the more likely managers are to learn&#13;
the requisites of success); the degree of importance that the society&#13;
pl;ncrs Qn Ounctuility; and the degrcc to whlich managers have been exposed&#13;
to punctuality norms in the countries to which exports are sent.&#13;
Part of the difference in the punctuality records of East Asian&#13;
and Colombian clothing exporters is no doubt due to differences in the&#13;
ability to guarantee delivery on time. The organizational ability of&#13;
the avcrage manager may he important here; also thic degree to whichi workers&#13;
identify with the enterprise. In Korea, it is not tuncommon for selected&#13;
employees to work arouindi the clock for several days in succession if a&#13;
report or job has to be finished urgent]y: in Colombia, this is less&#13;
common. The extent to which inputs are late in arriving probahiv differs&#13;
also between the two societies; in Colombia the unreliability of domestic&#13;
supplies and the customs clearance delays incurred when inputs are&#13;
imported, plus the lesser degree of reliability of freight transport&#13;
services, places even efficiently-managed firms under a h!MndiC:n.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Buit flartly, too, as a restilt o l differing cultrural nolmt of&#13;
punctutality, perceptions of how important it i:. to (leliver on time may&#13;
well diFfer betwveen Colombia andi(i East Asia.  In Colombia, for instance,&#13;
a pcrson who is invited for dtinner at 7:00 p.m. andt is on the ioorstep&#13;
at 7:30 has certainly arrived too early; unless "U.S. time" was specified,&#13;
8:00 or 9:00 would have been regardedl as punctual .  In mticih of East Asia,&#13;
by contrast, 7:30 would ne consiclerel either late or on the borderline&#13;
of lateness, while by 9:00 thc guest is likely to have have miss:d the&#13;
meal.  Nor, of course, is the (lifference in the concept of punctuality&#13;
restricted to dinner invitations - the general Colombian relaxedness,&#13;
and East Asian precision, with respect to time pervadle most areas of&#13;
life.  As.with quality control, almnost all of the managers in otir sample&#13;
who have consistently delivered on time are immigrants or their descendants&#13;
or have lived for at least a year or two in the United States or Europe&#13;
and have thus been exposed to the attitudes to time of those cultures.&#13;
CIIMNGES OVER 'TM!-&#13;
By their nature, culturally-influeCnced variabICs like attitudes to&#13;
quality control and punctuality of delivcry might be expected to changc&#13;
only slowly, if at all, over time. Yet outstandling counter-examples&#13;
exist. It rmav be remembered that. as recently as the 195(1's, "Made in&#13;

similarly to improve.&#13;
WVith respect to punctualit., it is only three decadcs since the&#13;
Korean concept of time was more akin Co that of Latin America than to&#13;
that of the Ililited States.&#13;
Finally, not fifteen vears have passed since numerous well-qualified&#13;
social scientists expatiated in detail on the cultural harriers to&#13;
economic develonmcint in Korea - and on the reasons why Koreans do not&#13;
work hard. The following passages arc representativc: 3)&#13;
Confucianism influenced Korea together with Buddlhism for over&#13;
2,000 y,cars... it is evident that the Confucian ideal still&#13;
overwhelmingly sways Korean social usages.. .The traditional idea&#13;
of Korean Confucianism did not have much respect for technical&#13;
and physical or manual labour but rather despised this.   Laboring&#13;
for material production could not have the qualities of being the&#13;
gentlenian.  Labour was the job only for a workman.  Thereforc,&#13;
industrial techniques could never he developed .. Trade and commerce,&#13;
without being esteemed, even nominally, had been regarded as the&#13;
ncar :t sort of work... Such idea.s of the Korean traditional Confucianism&#13;
should be thoroughly eliminated to make way for the ideological&#13;
bascs for democraitic and liberalistic modernization.4)&#13;
One of the principal virtues necessary for increased production seems&#13;
to 'e diligence.  Work should be liked, and l.bor should be respected...&#13;
Thc traditional values of Korea, hoi,ever, do not always encourage the&#13;
virtic -of diligence or the will to work... Confucians and Korean&#13;
ancestors... advised diligence mainly in coniniectionl witil mcntal work.&#13;
1.  It might be argued, on thic other hand, that even in the 19SO's the&#13;
.Japanese were capable of prock cing top quality articles, but that they&#13;
werc simply producing thc cheap, five-and-dime merchandise that their&#13;
fo;-cign buyers tihen wanted from them.&#13;

Not only does there seem to have beenl a rcmark-ab e change in kore..n attitudes&#13;
in just over a decade,1)there also seems to be a discrepancy betwc,:en the&#13;
evaluations of the compatibility of Confucianism with development that&#13;
were curient in the mid 1960s and that of the Geigers (quoted earlier) of&#13;
1973. Mlibe I should have heeded Epicurus after ali.&#13;
1. One possible explanation of this apparently ahrupt change is that Korean&#13;
culture was always potentially compatible with rapid capitalist develop-&#13;
ment, but that it was necessary to enter a period of political and&#13;
economic stability and to "get the policies righit" before this potential&#13;
could be realized.  If this hypothezis holds any %atcr, it is interestirig&#13;
to speculate on whether it might not have some app]licabi lity in C0olombia&#13;
and other parts of Latin America as well.&#13;

PART 3. IVHY THE EMPEROR BUYS IN EAST ASIA&#13;
Chapter 8&#13;
SUIMARY, CONCLISIONS ANnD GNERALIZATIONS&#13;
Since a distinguishing feature of this study is the amount of detail&#13;
into which it has been possible to go, any summary necessarily omits at&#13;
least part of what is interesting. Tlhus, in the interests of brevity, it&#13;
is not possible to summarize here, among other things, the discussion of&#13;
Colombia's fictitious and smuggled clothing exports, the reasons for the&#13;
failure of intermediaries and consortia of small exporters,the distribution&#13;
among 'U.S. buyers and Colombian sellers of the marketing profits from&#13;
exporting, or the changes over time that have occurred in Korean attitudes&#13;
to punctuality and physical work, Nevertheless, it is possible, and&#13;
it may perhaps be useful, to bring together some of the more general conclusions,&#13;
Although the statistics on Colombia's clothing exports are highly&#13;
problematical, the overall trend is clear. Before 1970, exports were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 192 -&#13;
negl igible.  Between 1971) anid 197,1-75, exports to al I ma rkcts grew&#13;
rapidiv.  Atter 1974-75, cxlorts to Venezuela and the Caribbean coeltilnuetd to&#13;
rise, but siles to the Unitedl States and Iurope declinied sharply. This&#13;
declir.e levelled off, and there was a slighit recovery, between 1977 and&#13;
1979; hut the volume of exports duiniig the first halF of 1979 (con%crted&#13;
to an annual ratc) was still no greater than the after-the-fall volume of&#13;
exports of 1976(. Thle all-iimportant, pattern of Colombia's exports of&#13;
clothinig to the Ilnited States is illust rated i: Fig. 8.1.1)&#13;
By concentrating in this study on the rise and decline of Colomlba's&#13;
clothing exports to the Unitecd States and Lurope. 1 do. not mean to imply&#13;
that exports to Venezuela and the Caribbean arc tin important. A diollr is&#13;
a dollar, and neighbors' dollars are as good as anyonie's.   But export ing&#13;
apparel to Venezuela and the Caribbean is littIe dif fc-crnt from scl!ing it&#13;
domestically: the same garmeiits can be shipleid on essential Iy the same&#13;
te&#142;rms.  For exports to the United States and i.urope, by conitr.st, competition&#13;
is keener zindI prices are lower; quaIlity conitiol stand:irds are tighter;&#13;

andel the sizes and shapes of customers differ from those in ColombiT;a. Given,&#13;
in addition, that the Venezuiela n and Caribbean inarkets are minuJscuie by&#13;
comparison witth those of the lInited  ;t ates and  u ltrope, and that Colombi ,,n&#13;
firms have important transport cost and institintioonil1 advantaijes in their&#13;
own region, it is clearly the fC.te of Colombia's sales to the lunlited States&#13;
and Fairope rather than those to Venezuela and the Ciri bbean that reflects&#13;
the long-term  health and futiuie piroslects of the country's garment-exportting&#13;

industry.  If present trends continue, Colom)bia may have to resign itself to&#13;
being just another of the nLnny also-rans in the inteinaitionail garment-&#13;
exporting business; at worst, its exports of apparel to the United States&#13;
and Europe might disappear altogether. )   'ventually, if the roots of the&#13;
problem are not tackled, Colombia may begin to lose ground to it. compc F itors&#13;
in Venezuela and the Caribbean as well.&#13;
CAUSES OF THE RISE AND FALI.&#13;
The most important single reason why Colombia's exports of clothling to&#13;
the United States and Europe began to grow rapidly after 1970 is that the&#13;
government's exchange rate and export incentive policies had begun to make&#13;
them profitable. Before 1967, Colombian governmecits tended to tackle balance&#13;
of payments problems by carrying out a jump devaluation,waiting until inflation&#13;
had eroded away its benc!fits, and then jump devaluing again.  As a result,&#13;
between 1953 and 1967 there were never more than two consecittive y'ears&#13;
in whilici the real effective exchange rate movedl in the same udirection.2)&#13;
This made exporting a risk)' business indeed, since a businessman could&#13;
never be sure what his real retuins Would be from one year to the next.&#13;
From 1967 onwards, there was a dramatic andl weIll-publ icized change.&#13;
As a result of the introduction of a crawling peg exchnnge rtlre and other&#13;
export incentive measures, for the first time in over a (*larter aF ;t&#13;
1.  Colombia wouldl not be the first country whose clothiing expolts to world&#13;
markets first increased anJ then disappeared: .Japnn's exlp rts of aipparel&#13;
to the United States rose from insignificance to clominn .cc and returnIeCd to&#13;
insignificance within 15 years (Allison (1977) and *1;:IlIc 4.3 above) . Btlt&#13;
in Japan's case it was the rapid( rise in dlomestic living standards, and&#13;
hence labor costs, that forced( it out of the 1..S. ivi:rket.&#13;
2. The real effective exchange rate is the nominal or ofFicial exchange rate&#13;
adjuistedl for expert incentIivos and for dlomestic and foreign pricc increnses.&#13;
As usedi in this stuly, it measures the relative profitability of exporting&#13;
as opposecl to selling goods domestically.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 195 -&#13;
century the real effective exchange rate rose continuotusly, or at least&#13;
did not fall significantly, for six consecutive years.    Not surprisingly,&#13;
it took two or three years until this new policy began to bear fruit.&#13;
It took time until entrepreneurs began to believu that exporting goods&#13;
other than coffee and petroleum might be feasible and nrofitable and tha.t&#13;
this profitability might be maintained; time until plant and equipment&#13;
cruld be adapted and workers retrained to meet the stringent requirements&#13;
of export hiarkets; and time until buyers could be found, orders received,&#13;
.goods produced, and an export mnomentum built up.&#13;
Then, in 1973, this time without any official pronouncement - on the&#13;
contrary, government statements continued and continue to stress the&#13;
£mportance of exports for the country's futture - the new post-1967 policy&#13;
was reversecl.  For the next six years, the real effcctive exchange rate&#13;
underwent an almost continuous decline.   Once again, it took two or three&#13;
years until entrepreneturs perceived wlhat was happening, believed that it&#13;
was likely to continue, adjusted their plans, and either cuit back their&#13;
exports or switched them to easier neighboring markets. Bv late 1978,&#13;
depending on the particular index chosen, the real effective exchange rate&#13;
was either equal to or 15 percent below the level at which it had stood&#13;
in the balance of payments crisis year of 1967. The improvement in the&#13;
profitability of exporting relative to selling domestically that had been&#13;
achieved during 1967-73 had beell totally reversed.   The fall in thp&#13;
profitability of exporting that occurred is reflected clearly in the figures&#13;
for effective protection for 1978. In that year, a firm manufacturing jeans,&#13;
blouses or shirts from domestic fabric received effective protection from&#13;
the tariff and export subsidy system of 30 to 100 percent if it sold the garments&#13;
in Colombia, compared to -32 tu -62 percent if it sold them abroad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

)n-price factors p;laye-' some role in the post 1970 rise of Colombia's&#13;
clothing exports. Visits of U.S. buyers to Colcmilia in the early 1970's helped&#13;
new exporters to overcome some of their initial market-entry problems, the&#13;
purchase by some Colombian compzinies of licences to uso foreign brand names&#13;
helped these firms to raise both fasliion awareness and labor lproductivity,&#13;
and hence increased their ability io offer up-to-date garments on world&#13;
markets at competitive prices.   But it was ir the fall of Colombia's&#13;
clothing exports to the difficult markets that non-price factors played a&#13;
crucial part. For reasons of convenience, the cliscussion of this role is&#13;
delayed until the following section.&#13;
The levelling off or slight recovery of garnielIt exports to the United&#13;
States that occurred after 1977 'as rested heavily on a hanidful of firms&#13;
that appear to have been holding on1 to their hard-won U.S. markets for as&#13;
long as possible in the hope that the profitability of exporting might improve&#13;
in the future.  Three of these firms, which accounted for half of Colombia's&#13;
total garment exports to thY United States in 1978, have special long-term&#13;
arrangements with their U.S. buyers.&#13;
CALISES OF EAST ASTAN PRFDOMTNAN('E&#13;
Whereas Hlong Kong, Korea and Taisan have a combLned population&#13;
that is less than 2^- times that of Colonbia, the total value of&#13;
the three rations' garment exports is 150 times that of CoJombiI.&#13;
Colombian clothing exporters who were interviewed for this stucly generally&#13;
blamed cheap labor, heavy government subsidization, or cheap transport&#13;
costs for the difference.   On all three counts, they were wrong.&#13;
Because of rapidly rising East Asian standards of living, garment&#13;
industry wages in ilong Kong are now 50 to 100 percent above those in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 197 -&#13;
Colombia, while wages in Korea and Taiwan are at least not signiricantly&#13;
below Colombia's.  Government export subsjieis are non-existent in Iong&#13;
Kong; in Korea and Taiwan they seem to be no greater than in Colombia.    In&#13;
transport, if, as is common, Colombians tist air whereas 1'ast Asians ship by&#13;
sea, it is the Colombitais isho have a significant advantage:  they can land&#13;
goods in New York for the ,ame transport costs as Ea,. Asians but at a sdving&#13;
of four weeks ir. in-transit t'me.  The fact tha. transport and communication&#13;
se7vices tend to operate more frequently and more reliably in East Asia&#13;
partly, but only part]y, offsets this advantage.   Nor do lJ.S. import  quotas&#13;
explain East Asia's predominance; only in two narrowly-definlcd product lines&#13;
has quota hampered thc growth of Colombia's clothing exports, and then only&#13;
since 1977. -&#13;
,The main price-related factors that do help to explain the difference&#13;
in clothing-export performance between Colombia and East Asia are lahor&#13;
productivity and fabric prices.   On average,,output per worker in the&#13;
garment induistry appears to be 30 to 50 percent higher in Fast Asia than&#13;
in Colombia; as a rcsult, rolombia's labor costs (wages paid per garment&#13;
prodlucedl) are significanitly' higher than those in Korea, Taiwan, and possibly&#13;
Hong Kong.  Differences in the abilities of management, both tor-   and&#13;
middle-lcvel, seem to be of primary importance in cxplaining this procluctivity&#13;
difference, but cultural and social factors may play some role as well.&#13;
The latter might includle the degree to which workers identify with the&#13;
goals of the firm, the degree to which they' are susceptible to organization&#13;
and discipline, the protection that they have against being fired, the&#13;
generalizeu societal training that they receive in manual dexterity; and&#13;
the place that money incomc or   being seen to he "doing one's duty" holds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 198 -&#13;
on workers' and managers' scales of values rclative to tile place of a&#13;
relaxed and sociable work experience or an ca,y life.&#13;
In East Asia, garment cxporters are assutred of duty-free accr.s to top&#13;
quaility fabrics at world prices.  In Colombia, despite the fact that local&#13;
textile firms export fabric and have done so for over a decadc, the prices that&#13;
clothing exporters have to pay for domestically-produced fabric are 50-l100&#13;
percent above world levels. In cotton clolh, this is because the four&#13;
large textile firms t.e their oligopoly power behind high protective walls&#13;
to raise prices.  In synthetics, the problem begins further back in the&#13;
production chain with the too-small plants for petrochemicals and synthetic&#13;
f:bers "tt also ^j  iy high protection and produce at high unit costs.   The&#13;
effects of the overpricing of domestic     rics can be seen clearly in the&#13;
breakdown of Cobonmbia's clothing exports to the lJnited States by type of&#13;
material. ihereas more than 80 percent of the counltry's textile exports&#13;
are of cotton, less than 20 percent of its exports of garments are of cotton.&#13;
The garment exporters' logicall solution to this overpricing problem would&#13;
seem to be to import fabric under the V'allejo Plan drawback arrangement, and&#13;
almost all firms that export to the difficult markets do so; but administrative&#13;
problems and delays reduce the sclheme's value. At least two weeks' delay is&#13;
incurred before an import request is approved by INCOMFX, and at least two to&#13;
four weeks more arc needed to clear the goods, once landed, through customs. Given&#13;
that the scason in the clothing business is only twelve weeks in length,&#13;
these delays are crucial.  Together, they effectively nulllify and often&#13;
reverse the one clear advantage that Colombiai has over East Asia in garment&#13;
exporting: the ability to offcr shorter lemad and turnaroutnld times. Since&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 199 -&#13;
they are of unpredictable length, thc delays also' incrcase the risk involved&#13;
in exporting.  Garment exporters who wish to import from abroad fabrics&#13;
that are produced locally have to submit a letter of approval from the&#13;
relevant local textile firm; but garment makers are understandably&#13;
reluctant to request such a letter for fear of retaliation.    I'lle cxport-&#13;
processing zones (Free Zones), which ought to provide a solution to these&#13;
'problems, do not do so.&#13;
Among the non-price reasons for Colombia's inability to compete with&#13;
East Asia, differences in the degree to wlhichi quality control and punctuality&#13;
of delivery arc maintained seem to bc the most important.    'Ihc best&#13;
Colombian firms are as good on these two criteria as any firms anywhere;&#13;
but t2e less-than-satisfactory performance of a ntmiber of Colombian companies&#13;
has given the country a bad name and has helpcdl to contributc to the fall of&#13;
the country's exports to thle difficult markets.   Some managers apparently do&#13;
not perceive how important   quality conitrol and punctuLlity are for sales to&#13;
world markets.  This may partly reflect the fact that quality control and&#13;
punctuality norms in Colombia are rather different from those in thc&#13;
United States and Europc; wlhich, in turn, may partly result from the fact&#13;
that Colombian garment producers have been sheltered from import competition&#13;
in the domestic market.   Thle unreliability of domestic textil,es suppliers&#13;
(both in terms of the quality and the timing of doliveries), delays in&#13;
importing inputs, and robberies in the ports all aggravate the quality&#13;
control and punctuality problems.&#13;
U.S. garment buycrs commonly point out that you can pet anything&#13;
you want in l1ong Kong, Korea or Taiwan - any garment, in any material&#13;
(cotton, wool, synthetics, fur, leather), at competitive prices, acceptable&#13;
quality and dlelivCred on time.  In Colombia, by contrast,  the range of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 200-&#13;
garments and fabrics is limited, prices are in general highier, and quality&#13;
and delivery times are less dependable.    As a result, whereas many buyers&#13;
maintain full time purchasing cffices in East Asia, there is not a singile&#13;
permanent foreign btuying office  in Colombia that specializes in clothing.&#13;
This, in turn, makes garment exporting a riskier business for Colombian&#13;
clothing firms than it is for East Asians: so few Colombian firms specialize&#13;
in exporting; so few foreign buyers,come to the country...and the East&#13;
Asia-Colombia gap continues to widen.   Success breeds success; fa.lure&#13;
breedls failure.&#13;
Despite the apparent bleakness of the picture, it is important not&#13;
to lose perspective. Only ten years ago Colombia hardly cxported any&#13;
clothing at all, and few Colombians believed that exporting to world&#13;
markets on today's scale would he feasible.    If the apparently impossible&#13;
could be achieved once, perhaps it can be achieved again.&#13;
POLICY OPTIONS FOCR COLOMBIA&#13;
Assuming that the Colombian government is interested in helping the&#13;
country's garment exporters to compete with East Asia, what measures might&#13;
it take? First of all, it might try to ensure that exporting garments is&#13;
made (and remains) at least as profitable as selling the same goods at home.&#13;
TcF achieve this, the real effective exchange rate for clothing exports would&#13;
need to be raised - this would at the same time help to narrow the cost&#13;
differential between Colombia and East Asia - andL the government would&#13;
have to commit itse;f and its successors to maintaining this real&#13;
effective rate for at least five or ten years.    Lonig term policy commitments&#13;
of this type are of course more difficult to make under the Colombian&#13;
political system, where a bi-party agreement would seem to be re(quired,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 201 -&#13;
than under the systems that prevail in liong Kong, Korea and Taiwan.&#13;
Protection against imported garments might also he lowered.&#13;
Second, clothinlg exporters would need to he assured of duty-free,&#13;
minimally-delayed access to a wide range of top quality fabrics at world&#13;
prices.  Tariffs on importe.d textiles might be lowered, and the full range&#13;
of fabric imports could be transferred from the licensing list to the free&#13;
list. The Vallejo Plan might be streamlined so that approvals could he&#13;
granted in 24 hours instead of two weeks; perhaps the requirement that&#13;
fabric imported under this scheme be re-exported could be converted to&#13;
a ton-for-ton basis.   Thie ports and customs authorities would need to be&#13;
overhaauled to ensure that, once goods arrive, they are clearecd in a day&#13;
or twqo instead of in weeks.  The existing Free Zones might be studied to&#13;
discover the reasons for their failure; new, improved Zones could then&#13;
be established.   An indirect export subsidy miglht be introduced; domestic&#13;
textile firms that sell fahric to garment-makers who in turn use this&#13;
cloth in their exports wouild then he,entitled to receive the CAT for such&#13;
sales, and perhaps PROEXPO credit as well. Indirect export suhsidies&#13;
of this type have been used successfuilly for important domestically-produced&#13;
inputs in Taiwan') and in Israel.&#13;
Third, since management ability seems to be crucial in hoth price&#13;
(labor productivity) and non-price(quality control, punctuality)areas,&#13;
the government might try various strategies to improve the country's&#13;
management. Large numbers of top and middle-level managers and graduate&#13;
students in business might he sent abroad for study and work experience&#13;
1. Little (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 202 -&#13;
and for exposure to U.S. and European standards of qu.al ity control and&#13;
punctualitv of delivery.  Foreign buyers could be invited to Colombia to&#13;
give short courses for managers and wouid-be managers which wouldl again&#13;
emphasize the important, hut often-neglected, non-price aspects of exporting.&#13;
It is difficult to rank thesc policy options in order of imlportance.&#13;
As New York buyers repeatedly stressed, price, quality, and punctuality&#13;
are all necessary conditions of export success in the clothing industryT;&#13;
the absence of any one of the elements of the package disqtualifies the&#13;
would-be exporter from serious consideration.   If one set of implications&#13;
had to oe chosen as the most important, however, it would probably be&#13;
that relating to price; for if exporting were made more profitable, entrepreneurs&#13;
and foreign buyers would have a   .rong incentive to overcome the quality&#13;
control and punctuality problems on their own.&#13;
It has been argued in Colombia that the nation's governments have been&#13;
riglht to allow the real effective exchange rate to (lecline cince 1973.&#13;
Inflationary pressures began increasing in about that year, making a slow-&#13;
down in the rate of devaluation apparently desirable, while the coffee&#13;
bonanza of .975 and later years has lessened the need for dollars to be&#13;
earned by clothing and other manufactured exports. If and when coffee prices&#13;
rall, this line of reasoning concludes, then pace of devaluation can be resumed,&#13;
and clothing exports will pick up again. Although this argument has some&#13;
appeal, it contains two important flaws. First clothing manufactures&#13;
learn from experience. They were drawn into exporting once and have&#13;
now painfully begun to withdraw; they are less likelv to be willing to&#13;
invest the timc, effort and money needed to break into foreign markets&#13;
next time (not to mention the time after that). Second, foreign buyers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 203 --&#13;
learn from experience too, with the result that it is sometimes more&#13;
difficult for an exporter to regain a lost market (partictularly if the&#13;
market was lost for quality control or punctuality reasons) than it i.;&#13;
to enter the saame market for the first time.  True, in itself, the lowering&#13;
of the real effective exchange rate that took place after 1973 influellced&#13;
the prices offered by clothing exporters rather than their quality control&#13;
or punctuality; hut a price problem is often translated into one of&#13;
punctuality since, in a squeeze, producers tend to deliver first to the&#13;
markets that they find most profitable.   Buyers have the whole %Orld to&#13;
choose from; if they hiave been let dowln by Colombian sutppliers once, thev&#13;
are likely to try many other possibilities before they return.   If clotlhing&#13;
and other man!;factured exports are to be'put on a long-run footing, therefore,&#13;
a more appropriate response to inflationary pressures and balance of payments&#13;
surpluses arising from high coffee prices might be to puzh ahead with the&#13;
liberalization of imports (wlhich helps on both fronts and aids manufactured&#13;
exports as well), rather than cutting back on the rate of devaluation.&#13;
GENERALIZING TO OTHER INDUSTRIES&#13;
The above policy implications were drawn up on1 the assumption that thle&#13;
Colombian government is interested in stimulating exports of clothing to&#13;
world markets; but of course, there is no particular reason to want to&#13;
export clothing as opposed to any other commodity.   It may be useful, therefore,&#13;
to examine the extent to which the conclusions ard policy implications&#13;
derived from this study are generalizable to other Colombian manufacturiog&#13;
industries. In the absence of similarly detailed stud(ies of other indlustries,&#13;
the following discussion is necessarily somewhat tentative.&#13;
Colombia's exports of other manufactured goods appear to havc followed&#13;
a pattern over time that is similar to that of exports of clothing to all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 204 -&#13;
destinations: a rapid rise thiotughi 1974-75 followedl by a more modlest rate&#13;
of increase since those years.1)   Thc increasing importance of %'cnezuela&#13;
as a destination also seems to be paralleled: by 1977-78 V'cne:uela had&#13;
overtaken the UInited States as the most important single market for Colombia's&#13;
total registered non-coffee exports.2) The difference in order of magnitude&#13;
between Colombia's exports of other manufactured goods and those of [long&#13;
Kong, Korea and Taiwan is almost as huge as for clothing.3) Furthermore,&#13;
Colombia's share of total IJ.S. imports under the U.S. 807 offshore assembly&#13;
scheme is significantly lower for all manufactured goods (it never reached&#13;
half of one peicent during 1973-77) than for apparel (5 to 9 percent during&#13;
1974-76) 4)&#13;
Clothing is similar to other indtustries in which dieveloping countries&#13;
have achieved export success in that average wages are low, the silare of&#13;
wages in value added is high, and economies of scale are unimportant.S)&#13;
Garments tend to be differentiated from each other more than some other&#13;
developing-country manufactured exports, but the marketing problems that&#13;
arise from this differcntiation are generally taken care of by the&#13;
developed-country buyers.   This all-important role of the buyers is by&#13;
no means limited to the clothing industry; rather, it is common in many&#13;
types of developing-country manuifactutred exports.6)&#13;

The most Important problems that have restricted Colombia's clothing&#13;
exnorts seem likely to have affected other Colombian industrial export and&#13;
potential-export industries as well:   a combination of high protection for&#13;
Jomestic sale of final goods and declining real effective exchange rates that&#13;
has caused the relative and 3bsolute profitability of exporting as opposed&#13;
to selling domestically to decline   ; lack of access to inputs&#13;
at world prices because of high protection granted to domestic input&#13;
producers and because of problems with the Vallejo Plait, the ports and&#13;
customs; and low labor productivity, inadequate quality control, and un-&#13;
punctuality of deliveries resulting from management deficiencies and cultural&#13;
factors.  Clothing ic also typical of other Colombian industries in the&#13;
disproportionate importance of a small number of firms in total foreign&#13;
sales  ; the apparent inabilitv of most small firms to export whether alone,&#13;
through intermediaries. or throtugh consortia3; the failure of the Free&#13;
Zones to stimulate exports (with the partial exception of manufacturedl metal&#13;
products) 4); and the inability of local exporters to capture a significant&#13;
shiare of total marketing profits.5&#13;
One difference between clothing and other industries is that seasons&#13;
are more important and fashions change more frequently in garments, which&#13;
means that short lead times and punctuality in delivering are more important&#13;
in apparel than in most industries. Nevertheless, no exporter of manufactured&#13;

shows a similar trend over time to that deflated by wholesale clotiling&#13;

goods is likely to keep hiis clients for long if his deliveries are continually&#13;
late or if his lead times are weeks longer than those of his competitors.&#13;
For example, one U.S. manufacturer closed down an electronics assembl) plant&#13;
that it had established in Haiti in favor   of one in Mexico because, even&#13;
,though Mexican wages were more than double those in hlaiti, the cycle time&#13;
was two weeks shorter in Mexico.1)&#13;
It might be thought that quality contrpl is more important in apparel&#13;
than in other industries - yet for many manufactured products this is&#13;
surely not the case. The damage that results if trousers shrink, colors run,&#13;
,or zippers break can hardly be compared with the consequences that would&#13;
ensue if a lathe's cutting edge or an automobile's wheel nuts were defective.&#13;
'Indeed there must be few manufactured goods in which quality control is not&#13;
of primary importance.   It might seem, too, that it is more important for&#13;
exporters of garments to have access to a wide range of imported inputs than&#13;
it is for producers of other goods    yet some 90 percent of all manufactured&#13;
exports from developing nations originate in countries that guarantee their&#13;
producers this kind of access.&#13;
Finally, perhaps the most important difference betwern apparel and other&#13;
sectors for the present discussion is that clothing is currently one of the&#13;
few industries in which developing country exports are subject to quota restrictions.&#13;
The distribution of quotas among exporting nations tends to be based on&#13;
historical performance; thus, Colombia's garment quotas are only a&#13;
fraction the size of those of Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan. Tllis means&#13;
that even if all obstacles to increased exports were rerioved tomorrow,&#13;
1/ Keesing (1978a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Colombia could still look forward to only modest rates of increase in its&#13;
exports of apparel to the United States and Europe)) This diffeienice will&#13;
not necessarily continue in the future; it seems at least possible that&#13;
the increasingly protectionist developed countries wil-I impose quantitative&#13;
restrictions sooner or later on imports of other manufactured goods as well.&#13;
These quotas, too, are likely to be distributed on the basis of past export&#13;
performance - which serves to underline the urgency of the need for policy&#13;
reform in Colombia if exporting manufactured goods is to continue to be a&#13;
central focus of the national development strategy.&#13;
In sum, clothing shares several important characteristics with othier&#13;
industries in which developing countries have achieved export success to&#13;
date; and-the key problems that have impeded Colombia's clothing exports&#13;
in the past seem likely to have retarded the exports of other Colombian&#13;
manufactured exports too.  Thus, the findings of this study may well be&#13;
of some relevance not only to clothing but also to other Colombian export&#13;
and potential-export industries.&#13;
1.  The possible increases would be modest hut they wotuld by no means he zero.&#13;
To begin witlh, clothing exports could increase severalfold before all existing&#13;
quota is utilized.  After that, the successful East Asian strategy of upgrading&#13;
items within quota cetegories (and hence increasing the value of exports&#13;
while the volume is held constant) could be followed.&#13;

Finally, to what extent are the conclusions and policy implications of&#13;
this study likely to be relevant to Latin American countries other than&#13;
Colombia?  In most relevant respects, Colombia is about as close to an&#13;
- "average" Latin American country as can be found.  It ranks fourth after&#13;
Brazil, Mexico and Argentina in size of population, and fifth after these&#13;
three and Venezuela in size of gross national Product (CNP).   It is neither&#13;
among the most nor the least industrialized Latin American nations; in&#13;
terms of GNP per capita it is poorer than many countries but by it is&#13;
no means thc poorest; the growth rate of its GNP per capita has been close&#13;
to,.- if 'lightly below, the Latin American average for two and a half decades;&#13;
and its distribution of wealth and income is typically skewed.1)&#13;
In total value of clothing exports Colombia ranks equal third with&#13;
Argentina behind Mexico and Brazil; in total value of exports of all&#13;
manufactured goods it ranks fourth behind Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.&#13;
In clothing exports per head of population Colombia ($2) is sutrpassed&#13;
only by Mexico ($3); while in per capita exports of all manufactured&#13;
goods Colombia ($27) is surpassed by Mexico ($38) and Argentina ($37),&#13;
but ranks ah^ad of Brazil ($21), Chile ($11), Venezuela ($10) and most,&#13;
if not all, othler Latin American couzxtries. By Latin American standards,&#13;
therefore, Colombia has been at least moderately successful as an exporter&#13;
of clothing and other manufactured goods; certainly, its inability to&#13;
compete with Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea has not been unusual (Tables 4.1&#13;
above and 8.1).2)&#13;

Coloirbia has bcen typical in the timing and nature of its policy&#13;
changes: s2vcral other Latin American countries shifted from import&#13;
substitution to export promotion strategies during the mid to late 1960's.&#13;
It has also been about average for Latin America in its degree of political&#13;
and policy continuity: some less democratic countries have had more stable&#13;
economic policies,but others (Chile, Peru, Argentina, Bolivia) have been&#13;
much more unst.Vle.&#13;
Many of th: problems that have hampered Colombia's exports of clothing&#13;
and other manufactured goods seem likely to have been similarly important&#13;
in other Latin American countries as well. In the face of sharply fluctuating&#13;
world prices for natural-resource-based exports and moderate to runaway&#13;
domestic rates of inflation, few countries have managed to maintain constant&#13;
real effective exchange rates (and hence constant real returns to exporting)&#13;
-for any length of time.  In most countries export subsidies were simply&#13;
grafted onto the existing import substitution structure; since protection&#13;
against imports remains high, the incentive to sell domesticallly is still&#13;
greater than that to export.1) Many countries still hamper their firn,s'&#13;
access to imported inputs whien domestically-produced substitutes are available 2);&#13;
and the port, customs, transport and communications problems of Colombia&#13;
3)&#13;
are by no means unique. Colombia's low level of labor prcductivity in&#13;
garment production is typical for Latin America - if anything, Colombian&#13;
productivity is 5 percent above the Latin American avcragc.4)   Some of the&#13;

cultural characteristics that may help to cause Colombia's relatively&#13;
inadequate productivity, quality control and punctuality performance (for&#13;
instance, the relatively relaxed attitude to time) are shared with much&#13;
1)&#13;
of Latin America.&#13;
Colombia differs from much of Latin America in being ideally located&#13;
to sell to the U.S. east coast market; but Central America2) and the&#13;
Caribbean islands share this locatioi'al advantage, while Mexico has still&#13;
easier access to the U. S.   market.    The Colombian drug trade has distorted&#13;
the nation's economy somewhat; but the main effect has been to cause a&#13;
domestic boom which exacerbates rather than causing the differential in&#13;
profitability betwveen selling goods domestically and exporting them.  It&#13;
seems unlikely that growers, processors and smugglers of drugs would&#13;
themselves be producing and exporting manufactured goods if the drug trade&#13;
were shut off.   Illegal sectors of economic activity are hardly unknown&#13;
elsewhere in Latin America.&#13;
In sum, Colombia is in many respects as "average" a Latin AMmerican&#13;
couritry as one could find; its manufactured export performance has been&#13;
quite good by Latin American standards: and many of the problems that have&#13;
impeded its exports of clothing and other manufactured products seem&#13;
likely to have retarded the manuifactured exports of other Latin American&#13;
1.  In Bolivia, difficulties in standardizinig quality control, among other&#13;
things, have hampered exports of handicraft garments (Inter-American&#13;
Development Bank, 19,9).&#13;
2. A number of Korean garment-exporting firms have attempted to sidestep the&#13;
quotas that restrict their home-based exports by setting Up operations in&#13;
Central America, but they have been unsuccessful so far, apparently because&#13;
of problems in obtaining inputs, whether domestically or by importing&#13;
(Wortzels, 1979a).&#13;

countries too. Thus, the findings of this study may be of relevance not&#13;
only to Colombia but also to some other Latin American nations.&#13;
1 . Although it is beyond the scope of this study to go into the issue in&#13;
detail, many of the findings may also be relevant to some&#13;
developing countries outside Latin America. In&#13;
the Philippines where the fact that most domestically-produced fabrics&#13;
are not of export quality means that garment-exporters routinely have to&#13;
import fabric, imported goods can take 3 to 6 months to clear the ports&#13;
and customs. In Thailand, a Taiwanese clothing entrepreneur who opened&#13;
a factory complained that productivity is lower than in Taiwan and that&#13;
absenteeism is high after payday.   According to a U.S. buying office in&#13;
Thailand, quality control (use of the wrong zips, threads etc.) is a problem&#13;
there (Wortzels, 1979a).&#13;

APPENDIX B&#13;
FORNULAS FOR EFFECTIVE EXPORI INCENTIE'1.S&#13;
T'he formulas used to calculatc the cffcctive rates of subs ILdN&#13;
that are implicit in the CAT, in subsidized PROI:\IPO ciedit, and in&#13;
the Vallejo Plan drawback scheme werc derived as follows.   In each&#13;
case, the effective subsidy is expressed as a percent of the valuc&#13;
of exports.&#13;
CAT&#13;
Question: What is the pretax taxable income (X*) that produces the&#13;
same net income after taxes as that received by a firm cxporting&#13;
goods valued at 100 pesos whichl receives an export subsidy (CAT) and&#13;
sells it at a discount (d) in the market?1&#13;
Define:&#13;
X - income from exports                (assumed to be 100 p)esos)&#13;
CAT - export subsidy                     (assumed to be 10%)&#13;
d - market discount on saic or CAT     (assumed to be 20%)&#13;
t - rate of company tax                (assumed to be 40%)&#13;
Before the 1974 tax reform&#13;
Pesos&#13;
Incomc from exports             x                              100.00&#13;
plus Net income from CAT         + CAT(l-d)                      8.00&#13;
= Total pretax income            = X+CAT(l-d)                  108.00&#13;
less Exemption of CAT from&#13;
taxable income                - CAT                         -10.00&#13;
= Taxable income                 = X-dCAT                       98.00&#13;
Taxes payable                      t(X-dCAT)                    39.20&#13;
Net income after taxes&#13;
(=108.00 - 39.20)              X+CAT(l-d)-t(X-dCAT)          68.80&#13;
= X(l-t)+CA'T'(l-d+td)&#13;
1. To simplify the analysis, it is assumed that the firm's costs of&#13;
production are zero.  Tlhe results are unchanged if this assumption&#13;
is relaxed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 223 -&#13;
Now derive the desired pretax taxable income (X*) and the implicit&#13;
effective CAT (CAT*):                                   Pesos&#13;
X*(l-t)       =  X(l-t) + CAT(l-d+td)             68.80&#13;
-,,   Xi  =  Xi+ CAT(l-d+td)                  114.67&#13;
(1-t)&#13;
,. CAT* =   A(1-dtd)                        14.67&#13;
After the 1974 tax reform&#13;
Pesos&#13;
Income from exports              X                             100.00&#13;
plus Net income from CAT          + CAT(l-d)                     8.00&#13;
= Total pretax income             = X + CAT(l-d)               108.00&#13;
less Taxes payable               -t[R+CAT(l-d)]                -43.20&#13;
plus-Tax discount of t&#13;
times nominal CAT             + tCAT                          4.00&#13;
= Net income after taxes          = X(l-t) + CAT(l-d+td)        68.80&#13;
Thus, the real subsidy implicit in the CAT is the same as before the&#13;
1974 tax reform despite the change after 1974 in the way that the&#13;
CAT is treated for tax purposes.&#13;
Timing&#13;
The above derivations ignored the fact that the CAT is not valid&#13;
for paying taxes immediately it is received. The period before it&#13;
becomes valid for such use varied from 3 to 12 months during 1967-78.&#13;
The derivations also ignored the fact that the CAT is sometimes sold&#13;
in the market only after a delay of from onle to several months, and&#13;
1. This is true for business enterprises but not for "personas&#13;
naturales" and the like, since these face different tax rates&#13;
on their persona] and business incomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 224 -&#13;
not, as is assumed above, inmediately it is received. Dcfining n as&#13;
the average number of years delay before the CAT is sold (0.08 &lt;n &lt;1.00),&#13;
and defining r as the market rate of interest, the above formula would&#13;
need to be altered as follows if such delays are to be taken into&#13;
account:&#13;
CATF -d           td&#13;
CAT* =     L(l+r)n +C(lr) n&#13;
1 -   t&#13;
(l+r)n&#13;
The net effect of taking these delays into account wfould be to diminish&#13;
the value of CAT* to some extent. The delays arc not taken into&#13;
account in the present study because the necessary data are not&#13;
available.&#13;
2.. PROEXPO CREDIT&#13;
Question: lWhat is the effective value (P*) of the subsidy that is&#13;
implicit in the cheap credit that is provided by PROEXPO to exporters&#13;
for six months?&#13;
Define:&#13;
C/X  - the percentage of the value of exports for which PROEXPO credit&#13;
can be received (80% from 1973 onwards, or 40% for users of&#13;
the Vallejo Plan. For the latter, it is assumed that imported&#13;
inputs account for 50% of the value of output).&#13;
r  - the market ratc of interest (varied between 14% and 28% during&#13;
1967-78).&#13;
r - the rate of interest on PROEXPO credit (18% from 1973 to mid 1977,&#13;
p&#13;
13% thereafter),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The effective subsidy implicit in PROEXPO credit (P',I is equal&#13;
to the present value of what is received less the present value of&#13;
what has to be repaid six months later. That is:&#13;
p*    C             * [I   ]&#13;
VALLEJO PLAN&#13;
Question: What 'is the effective subsidy (V*) that ;s implicit in&#13;
the Vallejo Plan? An enterprise using this plan is exempt from paying&#13;
tariffs and prior deposits on imports of raw materials or seiri-&#13;
finished goods that are to he used in producing commodities for&#13;
export.&#13;
Define:&#13;
M/X - thc percentage of the value of exports that is represented by&#13;
imported inputs (assumed to be 50°o on average for Vallejo&#13;
Plan users).&#13;
ti - the average tariff on imported inputs (for fabric the rate&#13;
declined from 69% in 1967 to 64% in 1978).&#13;
dep - the averagc effective rate of prior deposits ui, imports (130%&#13;
until early 1973, zero thereafter).&#13;
m - the average number of months during which prior deposits were&#13;
maintained at the Banco de la Republica (10 until 1972, 5 dur:ng&#13;
earl)' 1973, zero thereafter).&#13;
r - the market rate of interest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 226 -&#13;
Then, foilowing Teigeiro and Elson (1973):&#13;
V*= MAX (ti + dep. Mr&#13;
As for CAT* and P*, the absolute figures derived for the value&#13;
of V* are valid only for a comparison between an exporting firm that&#13;
uses the incentive scheme and another exporting firm that does not.-&#13;
The figures give an exaggerated idea of the absolute value of the&#13;
subsidy to a firm that would not have been able to export in the&#13;
absence of the scheme, since in this case part of the subsidy goes&#13;
towards enabling the firm to lower thc offering price of its exports.&#13;
Nevertheless, since this study is mainly concerned with the changes&#13;
that have taken place ovcr time in the effective valne of the&#13;
different incentives, this problem is not too serious.&#13;

            Why the emperor's new clothes are not
            made in Colombia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study focuses on the exports of a
            particular commodity (clothing) from a particular Latin
            American country (Colombia) in an attempt to understand why
            Latin America has been so much less successful at exporting
            manufactured goods to date than East Asia. Part I analyzes
            and attempts to explain the curious pattern of
            Colombia's clothing exports during 1967-78. Part II
            delves in detail into the price and non-price reasons why
            Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, whose combined population is
            less than 2-1/2 times that of Colombia, export garments
            whose value is 150 times that of Colombia's clothing
            exports. Part III summarizes some of the main conclusions,
            draws out some policy options that are available to
            Colombia, and examines the extent to which the findings are
            generalizable to other manufacturing industries and other
            Latin American countries. The study was done under a World
            Bank research project, Marketing Manufactured Exports (671-56).
