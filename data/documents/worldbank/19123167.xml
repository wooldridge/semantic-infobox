the region still lacks access to sanitation and approximately                        sanitation at home and 800 million people will yet have to&#13;

In January 2012, policy makers, scholars and practitioners                           Nevertheless, important progress is taking place to explore&#13;

together in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic2 to explore                            and sanitation services, whilst engaging communities and&#13;

    individual choices to decide either&#13;
    to adopt a habit or not, ought to be&#13;
    considered too. We know that the&#13;
    social norm influences our choices&#13;
    and hence behaviors. This is one of&#13;
    the reasons why information alone&#13;
    does not bring about behavior change6&#13;
    unless activities at community level are&#13;
    also included.&#13;
&#13;
    As an ongoing process, it is&#13;
    understood that behavior change&#13;
    needs to be continuously strengthened&#13;
    through different communication&#13;
    channels. Furthermore determining&#13;
    factors mentioned above, need to&#13;
    be dully identified up front and&#13;
    then be addressed by trustworthy&#13;
    communicators, within relevant cultural&#13;
    contexts. Said process goes beyond mass&#13;
    media campaigns, entailing a complex&#13;
    network of articulated interactions and&#13;
    methodologies that help targeting and&#13;
    engaging audiences.&#13;
&#13;
    There are several approaches that&#13;
    have been used to change prevailing&#13;
    practices or bring about change in&#13;
    behaviors of a family, such is the case&#13;
    of UN-HABITAT that developed a&#13;
    simple and easily understandable set&#13;
    of messages that are organized and&#13;
    communicated in a manner relevant to&#13;
    improvement of water and sanitation&#13;
    facilities throughout the project&#13;
    cycle. UNICEFâ&#128;&#153;s WASH program&#13;
    in schools (in LAC ESCASAL in&#13;
    Honduras or IEAS in Nicaragua)&#13;
    uses an effective approach that targets&#13;
    messages to specific audiences based on&#13;
    their motives towards adopting new                        Banner of the event â&#128;&#156;Beyond Infrastructure: Integrating Hygiene in Water and Sanitation Policy in&#13;

    Such a conceptual framework as FOAM allows researchers&#13;

   II.	 Clean water for human consumption: evaluation of sustainable solutions in Honduras and El Salvador.&#13;
&#13;
     Problem:&#13;
     Unfortunately, improved water, piped water specifically, regularly supplies contaminated water, often intermittently, to households&#13;
     throughout the developing world. The Root causes of this problem include:&#13;
     1.	 Quality of source water is compromised and is not always treated prior to distribution.&#13;
     2.	 Disinfection is often not monitored/enforced before it is delivered.&#13;
     3.	 Aging water systems develop leaks through corrosion.&#13;
     4.	 Intermittent services combined with leaky pipes causes suction in the pipes and contamination of the entire system or unsafe&#13;
         storage.&#13;
     5.	 Some operators lack the technical capacity in operations and maintenance to address the needs of a particular water system.&#13;
     6.	 Some village water committees lack the accounting and budgeting knowledge to raise funds and save for future fixes.&#13;
&#13;
     Research Questions &amp; Methods:&#13;
     1.	 What is the health and sustainability impact of household water filters over two years in households with contaminated, intermittent&#13;
         piped water in Honduras? (272 household surveys; water quality tests in each households at baseline, after one year, and two years&#13;
         with the filter).&#13;
     2.	 What is the effect of the post-construction support model, the circuit rider model, on the quality and sustainability of piped water&#13;
         systems in El Salvador? (120 structural observations of drinking water systems, 120 interviews with operators of water systems and&#13;
         presidents of water committees, 252 water quality tests and 126 residual chlorine tests in 60 piped water systems).&#13;

          Lessons for Implementation at Scale: This research suggests that it is not the technology alone that leads to the provision of a&#13;
          reliable, safe, sufficient, and sustainable drinking water service, it is the combination of effective technology, appropriate at the village&#13;
          and household level, availability of spare replacement parts, ongoing technical support, and behavior change promotion.&#13;

The challenge at sub national level is how to incorporate                                     rates. After 2 years of articulated effort, 13% drop in&#13;

long-lasting results. While field evidence has the potential                                  prevalence in some districts of the region.16&#13;
to generate a common understanding among different&#13;
sectors on the approach to water, sanitation and hygiene,                                     A systemic approach to hygiene promotion at scale&#13;
the corresponding roles for each sector need to be well                                       in Ethiopia provides lessons for replication in other&#13;

Authorities are becoming aware that in order to tackle                                        improvement resulted in a 24% reduction of defecation&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
      Box 1. Leading change at local level: the role of municipalities&#13;
&#13;
      a.	 The provincial municipality of Anta (Cusco, Peru) led a four year process that focused on environmental management&#13;
          to address a critical situation by which the population did not have access to clean water, adequate sanitation, and&#13;
          lacked sanitary culture. A technical team was set to design a holistic strategy and a plan was implemented on a phase&#13;
          by phase basis. The Mayor called all sectors on board and invited the international cooperation institutions to align&#13;
          its support to match the provinceâ&#128;&#153;s priorities. For the program to be successful the population had to envision a and&#13;
          environmental program was integrated into the primary curricula in all 42 primary schools, with topics such as hand&#13;
          washing, clean water, solid waste management, recycling, forestation and composting. Furthermore, there was a 48%&#13;
          and 74% increase in access to water and sanitation respectively. The city was arranged in 12 ecological neighborhoods&#13;
          as the population learned to pay for the municipal garbage collection service. Antaâ&#128;&#153;s population accessed micro credit&#13;
          to finance home improvement, in-door bathrooms in particular.&#13;
&#13;
      b.	 In Oaxaca, Mexico, a national program to promote Culture of Water, raise awareness on the scarcity of the resource&#13;
          and trigger its good use and preservation.19 A community based program, led by 80 municipalities that started in 2001,&#13;
          included promotion of water purification methods and handwashing with soap; as well as sanitation improvement to&#13;
          reduce open defecation, and local capacity building efforts to assure effectiveness. Over 66 water treatment plants&#13;
          were built resulting in a 98% of the water distributed being purified. This comprehensive program reduced children&#13;
          diarrhea by 40%. Furthermore, the Water Culture became preventive policy in Mexico.20&#13;

One year after the HWI project ended, WSP found that&#13;
several of the companies that had invested in previous&#13;
years, continued to assign resources to the program. A&#13;
short survey was launched to learn about the reasons and&#13;
motivations beyond these decisions, and the internal factors&#13;
that justified an extension, even a scale up of the HWI to&#13;
new areas. A challenge remaining for public entities is to be&#13;
able to congregate and coordinate private efforts towards a                              Attendees of the event&#13;

     learning from all participating countries provides insight                            media messages alone.26 Catalyzing and coordinating these&#13;

     reform in Latin America. Some of them are briefly presented&#13;
     below.                                                                                Sound policy from top to bottom&#13;
                                                                                           Taken together, water, sanitation and hygiene are a concern&#13;
     The starting point                                                                    of multiple sectors and government levels. As such, the&#13;
     It is important to remind ourselves that every year 1.8                               multi-sector approach to water, sanitation and hygiene must&#13;
     million die due to the consequences of continuous and                                 be included in public policy to enter the public domain and&#13;
     severe diarrhea episodes. The main cause of these deaths is                           become permanent.&#13;
     attributed to the lack of access to water and sanitation, and&#13;
     absence of appropriate hygiene practices.23 Evidence shows                            A main challenge for policy makers is to come together and&#13;
     that improved water and sanitation enables safe hygiene                               identify the role each sector should adopt as well as their&#13;
     practices such as handwashing and may trigger community                               responsibilities along the process. This implies selecting the&#13;
     spillovers in terms of environmental health benefits from                             appropriate indicators and budget lines to be allocated for&#13;
     sanitation.24 Handwashing with soap is the most cost                                  action planning, implementation and monitoring. Sound&#13;
     effective hygiene practice: one year of life, free of disease                         policy design is the result of a timely effort that needs to&#13;
     and disability is gained for $3.00 invested in handwashing                            be endorsed by strong political will at the highest level of&#13;
     with soap promotion, as opposed to $2,750 invested in                                 government and supported by professional specialized&#13;
     cholera immunizations.25                                                              technical advice.&#13;
&#13;
     Multi sector implementation requires strong local                                     Private sector provides added value&#13;
     capacities                                                                            This sector stands out as an endless resource to bring progress&#13;
     Field evidence is abundant in regards to the benefits brought                         to low income families. Private investors are looking at the&#13;
     by linking water and sanitation to hygiene â&#128;&#147; most of the                              â&#128;&#156;base of the pyramidâ&#128;&#157; for opportunities of economic growth.&#13;
     cases nevertheless refer to pilots or projects implemented                            This implies that new products and services are generated to&#13;
     at district level. How these isolated experiences are scaled                          target the needs and priorities of low income segments of the&#13;
     up remains as a primary challenge. On the other hand,                                 population.&#13;

       Box 2. Hygiene promotion in a post disaster context â&#128;&#147; Haiti, after January 12, 2010&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Over the past decades, Haiti has remained vulnerable to severe economic and social crises as well as to adverse&#13;
       natural events. The earthquake that struck the island in January of 2010 killed 200,000 people and left 1m homeless.&#13;
       The situation worsened when, in October of the same year, a severe outbreak of cholera was confirmed, causing 2,500&#13;
       additional deaths and putting about 200,000 people at risk of infection.&#13;
&#13;
       Living conditions in Haiti, particularly in the camps and in slum communities, make the country extremely vulnerable to&#13;
       the spread of cholera. These communities have almost no water and sanitation infrastructure, limited health knowledge&#13;
       and often no access to health care. The already fragile public health system, which is expected to provide preventive&#13;
       care, health promotion, curative, rehabilitative and referral services, was further weakened by the earthquake making it&#13;
       more challenging to treat patients with health workers who lack experience in managing cholera cases.&#13;
&#13;
       The Government prepared a National Strategy for the Response to the Cholera Epidemic, including the health and water&#13;
       and sanitation response and a Cholera Inter-Sector Response Strategy was developed by partners as a flash appeal&#13;
       supporting activities that limit the cholera epidemic through short-term water supply improvements, an increase in&#13;
       hygiene promotion and heath education campaigns, reinforcement of sanitation and waste management, and effective&#13;
       coordination with local authorities. Hygiene promotion, all though critical in this context, was challenging.&#13;
&#13;
       According to John Hopkins Resident Advisor, Elsie Lauredent, a major challenge had to be faced: how to prioritize and&#13;
       coordinate actions of a complex and multiple post earthquake response.&#13;
&#13;
       A partnership of Governmental and non-Governmental institutions was established to develop the Cholera Inter-Sector&#13;
       Response Strategy for Haiti, to reduce mortality and morbidity by limiting the impact of the current cholera outbreak&#13;
       through various projects to be implemented by 42 NGOs, five UN agencies, and the International Organization for&#13;
       Migration. Under this strategy, these partners are implementing activities clustered around three main themes: (i)&#13;
       promoting hygiene and health awareness and distribution of water purification tablets and hand-washing products; (ii)&#13;
       setting up treatment centers for cholera patients; and (iii) ensuring access to safe water and sanitation in camps and&#13;
       vulnerable areas.&#13;
&#13;
       According to Ms. Lauredent the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s leadership improved coordination among sectors and motivated a strong&#13;
       commitment of different actors in the community. Nevertheless, the response to emergencies needs to be integrated&#13;
       into the countryâ&#128;&#153;s risk management programming for sustainability purposes.&#13;

&#13;
     Using cellular technologies to monitor health interventions&#13;
     in distant locations is one such invention that is bringing&#13;
     efficiency to the sector. Micro credit schemes are erupting&#13;
     in rural areas where families are investing in home&#13;
     improvements including in-house water and sanitation&#13;
     facilities. But private firms are also closing gaps at local&#13;
     level. Agricultural and mining companies assign funding to&#13;
     improve the lives of their surrounding communities.&#13;
&#13;
     Corporate Social Responsibility is a growing trend in&#13;
     Latin America that channels millions of dollars every year&#13;
     to improve education, nutrition, and health, as well as&#13;
     strengthening the sustainable productive capacities of the&#13;
     rural poor and excluded families; precisely the top priority&#13;
     shared by all middle income countries. Learning from these&#13;
     already validated experiences is a field of study in itself.&#13;
&#13;
     The power of the municipalities rests on their proximity&#13;
     to the population&#13;
&#13;
     On the one hand municipalities directly face their priorities&#13;
     and must deliver effective solutions to gain constituent&#13;
     approval; on the other hand, they have the opportunity&#13;
     to validate creative models and experience results. It is at&#13;
     local level that the multi sector approach comes to the fore&#13;
     and shows results. It is at local level that national policy is&#13;
     validated â&#128;&#147; if it does not reach community level and translate&#13;
     into improvements to quality of life of the poor population,&#13;
     social policy has no relevance. Close attention is worth paying&#13;
     to what happens at the local level, it is the learning ground&#13;
     where policies can be revised, and also a source of emerging&#13;
     learning to replicate and scale to other areas, provided results&#13;
     are measured rigorously.&#13;

            Integrating behavior change and hygiene in
            public policy : four key dimensions - lessons from the
            conference "beyond infrastructure : integrating hygiene
            in water and sanitation policy in Latin America and the Caribbean"
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            During the past decade countries in the
            Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region have lifted more
            than 50 million people out of poverty, yet half of the rural
            population in the region still lacks access to sanitation
            and approximately 20 percent to drinking water. In January
            2012, policy makers, scholars, and practitioners from nine
            LAC countries came together in Santo Domingo, Dominican
            Republic to explore the opportunities and challenges of
            integrating in a more systematic and sustainable way the
            promotion of hygiene and sanitation behavioral change into
            water and sanitation investments. During the conference in
            Santo Domingo, it became evident that a common understanding
            is currently emerging from most countries in the sense that
            infrastructure by itself will not solve the global problems
            of inadequate access to improved sanitation and potable
            water, unless people adopt new behaviors. Therefore, there
            is a need to spread learning on best practices to implement
            cost effective water, sanitation and hygiene models, which
            bring about change at home and in the community at scale.
            This paper highlights key issues that arose in presentations
            and group discussions during the conference, which, can lead
            to substantial improvements in the provision of a
            multi-sector approach to hindering sustainable water and
            sanitation services for all.
