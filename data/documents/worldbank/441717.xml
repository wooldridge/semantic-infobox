Telecommunications Reform-&#13;
How to Succeed&#13;
Bjdrn Wellenius    Today, more than sixty emerging economies-twenty-five in Sub-Saharan Africa alone-are&#13;
at some stage of transformation from state telecommunications monopolies to private-led,&#13;
competitive markets. When well done, this reform can be a positive-sum game in which all&#13;
stakeholders gain-customers, existing and new operators, employees, domestic and foreign&#13;
investors, and the government. Faster growth, better and new services, lower costs, and,&#13;
eventually, lower prices follow. This Note outlines the key ingredients of successful reform.&#13;
Get support at the top                     expecting to use sale revenues to reduce budget&#13;
deficits, financial advisers earning success fees&#13;
Reform is most likely to succeed if it is led at  tied to transaction prices-can steer reform off&#13;
the highest level of political authority. This is  this track. In particular, sale strategies that drive&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Telecommunications Reform -privatization
            and opening markets to competition- can be a positive-sum
            game in which all stakeholders gain: customers, existing and
            new operators, employees, domestic and foreign investors,
            and government. But the extent and timing of benefits vary
            from one case to another. The author sets out some rules for
            reform that will enhance those benefits: Get support at the
            highest level of political authority. Sort out conflicting
            objectives early especially the conflict between maximizing
            revenue and delivering more, better, and cheaper services.
            Use market mechanisms rather than individual negotiations to
            select the partners and determine the right sale price.
            Establish and follow clearly defined processes for sale and
            regulation that are open to participation and review by all
            interested parties. And respect and trust the general public
            and keep it informed. Although major transactions such as a
            privatization or the issuance of new licenses drive the
            reform agenda, change continues well beyond them. Following
            the rules and honoring commitments help consolidate an
            environment for sustainable development of telecommunications.
