HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
1.1          Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991. It has a land&#13;
mass that is the largest in Europe (with the exception of European Russia) and a population of 52 million&#13;
that ranks fifth in Europe. GNP per capita was estimated at US$ 1,910 in 1993. The economy rests on&#13;
industry and agriculture, which together accounted for more than 70 percent of GDP in 1991. Ukraine,&#13;
despite its size, is also heavily dependent on trade, notably with the rest of the former Soviet Union&#13;
(FSU).&#13;
1.2          The economic decline in Ukraine has been dramatic. Real GDP contracted by 14 percent&#13;
in 1993, bringing the cumulative fall in output since 1990 to 38 percent. This trend accelerated in the&#13;
1994 as GDP declined by about 23 percent. Due to loose fiscal and monetary policies, the rate of&#13;
inflation rose to an average of 4,735 percent in 1993 (up from 1,210 percent in 1992), and, in addition,&#13;
varied significantly from month to month. In the first half of 1994, the inflation rate came down to single&#13;
digit levels, primarily on account of flagging demand, itself the result of a large drop in real wages and&#13;
a stringent credit policy. A freeze in the adjustment of administered prices (particularly energy) after&#13;
December 1993 also contributed to the slowdown in inflation.&#13;
1.3          The external situation has become increasingly tenuous, reflecting a significant trade&#13;
deficit with the FSU -- about US$ 3 billion in 1993 -- which was only partially offset by a trade surplus&#13;
with the rest of the world. Developments in external trade have been marked by a sharp contraction in&#13;
trade volumes, a considerable decrease in the terms of trade as import prices of energy moved towards&#13;
world levels, and a modest shift in the direction of trade away from the FSU towards the rest of the&#13;
world. The foreign trade deficit led to the increasing accumulation of arrears on payments for energy&#13;
imports.&#13;
1.4          While external shocks, mostly brought on by the collapse of the FSU, have contributed&#13;
to the economic decline, so too have the policies of the Government. Through 1993 and the first half&#13;
of 1994, these policies have been marked by the absence of a coherent macroeconomic stabilization and&#13;
structural reform program. A few disparate and uncoordinated attempts at stabilization have been&#13;
undertaken instead. The Government resorted to a number of administrative measures to manage the&#13;
economy. Price controls (including fixed administrative prices, advance notification of price adjustments,&#13;
and an array of controls on profit margins) were expanded; the state order system dominated the domestic&#13;
trade of key commodities; and export quotas and licenses remained widespread. Very little progress was&#13;
achieved in privatization, and, due to frequent changes in regulations and high taxes, the growth of the&#13;
emerging private sector took place outside the formal economy.&#13;
1.5          In July 1994, Ukraine elected a new President who called for a radical break from the&#13;
past in economic policies. A comprehensive program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural&#13;
reforms was developed with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank. A series of difficult and far-&#13;
reaching measures were implemented in October 1994 to demonstrate the Government's commitment,&#13;
and the IMF approved a first purchase of US$ 365 million under the Systemic Transformation Facility&#13;
in support of the stabilization program. A Rehabilitation Loan (Ln. 3831-UA) of US$ 500 million was&#13;
approved by the Bank in December 1994 to support the implementation of structural reform measures&#13;
necessary to create the conditions for future economic growth led by a vibrant private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                         Sector Background&#13;
1.6          The Government's program calls for accelerating the transition to a market-oriented&#13;
economy. Within this framework, the economic package that the Government has adopted aims to break&#13;
inflationary expectations and promote a sustained recovery in economic growth. To this end, the program&#13;
focuses on four key interdependent elements. First, a stable environment is required so that producers&#13;
and consumers can make sound decisions without fear of macroeconomic disruptions. The stabilization&#13;
of the economy will rest upon tight fiscal and monetary policies. Second, competition in markets is&#13;
essential to an efficient allocation of resources. In an effort to promote free and open markets, the&#13;
Government will rely upon the liberalization of prices and domestic and foreign trade; the dismantling&#13;
of the state order system; demonopolization; and promotion of the private sector. Third, the hardening&#13;
of enterprise budget constraints through corporatization, privatization and the enforcement of bankruptcy&#13;
laws will encourage enterprises to respond to the new market forces. The elimination of directed credits&#13;
and credits to settle inter-enterprise arrears and financial sector reform are expected to support behavioral&#13;
changes at the enterprise level. Finally, the social safety net is to be strengthened through improved&#13;
targeting in order to protect the segments of the population most vulnerable to the adjustments associated&#13;
with the structural transformation of the economy.&#13;
B. Overview of the Energy Sector&#13;
1.7          Energy Demand. Energy demand in Ukraine is characterized by high energy intensity&#13;
in relation to industrial output and the high share of industry in final energy consumption. This is due&#13;
to the high share of heavy industry (iron and steel, basic chemicals) and the low thermal efficiency of&#13;
energy consumption technologies. Energy consumption per capita was about 3,500 kilogram oil&#13;
equivalent (koe) in 1993, which is quite high even by Western European standards. Following a decline&#13;
of 11 % between 1985 and 1990, the energy intensity of GDP increased by 40% in the 1990-1993 period&#13;
reaching 2.5 koe/US$, a ratio that is several times higher than in the most developed countries.&#13;
1.8          Primary Energy Resources. Ukraine has large, practically unlimited coal resources.&#13;
Donbass, the main mining basin, contains metallurgical coal, anthracite and high grade thermal coals, as&#13;
well as coalbed gas. The unusually difficult geological conditions (thin, steeply inclined coal seams at&#13;
great depth) in the central Donbass make the mining of coal costly and labor intensive. Natural gas and&#13;
crude oil resources are declining, but are still significant. Remaining proven and probable reserves are&#13;
190 million tons of oil and 1,400 bcm of natural gas. The shallower and larger oil and gas pools in the&#13;
Dnieper-Donetsk and Carpathian regions are rapidly being depleted. These deposits are replaced by&#13;
reserves in smaller, deeper and less productive reservoirs, which are more expensive to find, to drill-up&#13;
and to produce, to the point that a large part of the reserves appear to be uneconomic.&#13;
1.9          Energy Supply. Domestic energy production, consisting of fossil fuels and primary&#13;
electricity (hydro- and nuclear power), represented 48 % of consumption in 1993-94 (see Table 1.1). The&#13;
main import items were crude oil and oil products, originating almost exclusively in Russia, and natural&#13;
gas, originating in Russia and Turkmenistan. The cost of fossil fuel imports reached US$ 5 billion in&#13;
1993 creating a demand for foreign exchange that the economy was only partly able to meet. In mid-&#13;
1993, Russia agreed to convert Rb 1.05 trillion of accumulated arrears to state debt of US$ 2.5 billion&#13;
repayable over a six-year period. In 1994, arrears for gas delivered in 1993 by Turkmenistan were&#13;
converted to a state debt of US$ 0.7 billion repayable over a seven-year period (including two years of&#13;
grace). In late 1993, Russia introduced advance payment for crude oil deliveries that contributed to an&#13;
almost 40 percent drop in Ukraine's crude oil imports in the following year. Gas deliveries, despite&#13;
Ukraine's continued inability to pay, were maintained in 1994 at levels comparable to the previous year,&#13;
leading once again to the accumulation of arrears.&#13;

1.10            By October 1994, arrears for gas imported from Russia and Turkmenistan reached US$&#13;
1.5 billion and US$0.7 billion, respectively. While Russia continued to deliver, Turkmenistan decided&#13;
to suspend the deliveries of gas. An agreement between Ukraine and Turknenistan signed in November&#13;
1994 stipulated that payments of US$300 million would be made to Turkmenistan to resolve part of the&#13;
arrears, and Ukraine would also compensate Turkmenistan for the cost of gas delivered in the fourth&#13;
quarter of 1994 (the rest of the arrears would be rescheduled to be paid over seven years, with 2 years&#13;
of grace). Negotiations with Russia are planned to be concluded in early 1995, and there are indications&#13;
that Russia will agree to convert a large part of the already accumulated arrears to debt.&#13;
1.11            Energy Prices. Gasoline, diesel oil and fuel oil prices are liberalized. Electricity, gas,&#13;
and coal prices are set by the central government. Local governments set the price of district heating,&#13;
LPG, heating oil, peat and wood. With the exception of electricity, household energy prices cover only&#13;
&#13;

a fraction of costs. The difference is covered by central and local government budgets, and also by a&#13;
non-transparent surcharge on industrial consumers (for gas and district heat). Even for electricity, there&#13;
are several categories of households who are entitled to discounts, and the cost of these discounts is borne&#13;
by the industrial consumers. During most of 1994, additional price distortions were caused by: (i) a&#13;
subsidy to non-household consumers of coal; (ii) an artificial exchange rate that did not allow the passing&#13;
of the full cost of imported gas to consumers; and (iii) price adjustments for electricity and heat that&#13;
lagged behind fuel cost increases. Non-payment by customers became a major problem for electricity,&#13;
gas and heat suppliers, further weakening the financial position of the utilities. In October 1994, the&#13;
Government started the implementation of a program of price adjustments that: (i) drastically reduces&#13;
household energy price subsidies; (ii) eliminates the explicit and implicit (through the exchange rate)&#13;
subsidy to non-household consumers of coal and gas; and (iii) ensures the full recovery of increased fuel&#13;
and other basic input costs in the price of electricity and heat.&#13;
1. 12        Sector Institutions.  The sector is dominated by vertically integrated state owned&#13;
monopolies, controlled by the State Coal Committee, the Ministry of Power and Electrification&#13;
(Minenergo), the State Nuclear Energy Committee (Goskomatom) and the State Oil and Gas Committee.&#13;
In 1994, the Government started a corporatization prograrn in the oil, gas and power subsectors, with the&#13;
long term objective of privatizing those activities that are not natural monopolies (for more details on the&#13;
Government's program in the power industry, see Section D below). There are eight vertically integrated&#13;
state-owned regional utilities (Energos) under Minenergo. The regional utilities operate the regional&#13;
dispatch centers, portions of the transmission network, the thermal power plants, and the distribution&#13;
system. Two hydropower companies and the National Dispatch Center are directly under Minenergo.&#13;
Minenergo performs policy making and ownership, and also acts as a day-to-day utility business manager.&#13;
The concentration of the various, and in many ways conflicting, aspects of economic management in one&#13;
entity is a major obstacle to improving the efficiency and quality of electricity supply. Institutional&#13;
separation of the above functions, correction of fuel and electricity prices, commercialization of&#13;
enterprises, and promotion of competition are needed to establish the foundation for a modern, profitable&#13;
and efficient power industry.&#13;
1 .13        Employment. The energy sector employs almost 1 million people, or about 4.5 % of the&#13;
labor force. About 630 thousand are employed in coal mining, 140 thousand in the power industry, and&#13;
200 thousand in oil and gas production, refining, transport and distribution.&#13;
C. Power Industry Conditions and Priority Needs&#13;
1.14         Installed electricity generation capacity of the Ukrainian Power System (UPS) was 52,122&#13;
MW in 1993. It consisted of 12,818 MW of nuclear capacity, located in 5 plants with a total of 14 units&#13;
in operation. There were more than 40 thermal (fossil fuel) power plants with conventional steam cycle&#13;
technology, with over 110 generating units and a total capacity of 32,364 MW, of which 3,824 MW are&#13;
combined heat-and-power units. Hydro capacity was 4,700 MW, stationed mostly in 9 plants with a total&#13;
of 100 generating units. The capacity of industrial power plants was about 2,240 MW. The total&#13;
effective generating capacity of the system was about 50,000 MW, due to the derating of older plants.&#13;
Most older fossil fuel plants (about 23,000 MW) used coal as their primary fuel, but needed gas or mazut&#13;
for co-firing. About 5,520 MW of power generation as well as most of the combined heat-and-power&#13;
plants run on gas or mazut as main fuels.&#13;
1.15         Electricity generation was 228,316 GWh in 1993, of which thermal plants produced&#13;
135,875 GWh, nuclear plants 75,242 GWh, hydropower plants 11,214 GWh (including 200 GWh by a&#13;
pump storage plant), and industrial plants 5,985 GWh (see Table 1.2). Net export was 1,145 GWh (2708&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Sector Background                                                                          5&#13;
GWh exports, 1,563 GWh imports). Self-consumption of thermal and hydro plants was 10,648 GWh (or&#13;
about 7.2% of their total generation), and of nuclear plants 5,228 GWh (6.9% of total nuclear&#13;
generation). After accounting for other production needs (615 GWh), consumption of the pump storage&#13;
plant (302 GWh), and transmission and distribution losses (22,473 GWh, or 9.8 % of total generation in&#13;
the system), net electricity consumption came to 187,905 GWh. The peak demand in 1993 occurred in&#13;
January, and was about 37,000 MW; the minimum demand, in June, was about 17,000 MW. Heat&#13;
production was about 48 million Gcal. Total fuel consumption for electricity and heat production was&#13;
53 million tons of reference coal equivalent (tce, defined as 7000 kcal/kg), consisting of 19.4 million tce&#13;
of natural gas, 7.3 million tce of mazut, and 26.3 million tce of coal.&#13;

1.16         Electricity generation, domestic consumption and exports have all declined significantly&#13;
in recent years. Between 1990 and 1994, generation decreased by 32 %, domestic consumption by 25 %,&#13;
and net exports by 96%. The decline in generation and consumption is likely to continue for some time&#13;
(see Annex 1). GDP, however, declined even more (by about 50% in the same period), and, as a result,&#13;
the electricity intensity of GDP increased from about 1.95 kWh/US$ in 1990 (that was already about 3.4&#13;
times the OECD average in that year) to 2.52 kWh/US$ in 1994.&#13;

1.17          The Ukrainian power industry was developed and operated as a part of the integrated&#13;
power system of the FSU. During the last 15-20 years, investment policy favored the use of natural gas&#13;
and nuclear power at the expense of coal-fired plants. The aging coal plants, whose performance was&#13;
further affected by declining coal quality, have to use mazut or gas as supplementary fuels despite sharp&#13;
increases in the price of imported oil and gas after the break-up of the Soviet Union. The total fossil fuel&#13;
consumption of the thermal power plants consisted of 43.1 mt of coal, 20.2 bcm of gas, and 4.9 mt of&#13;
fuel oil in 1993, representing, respectively, 45%, 20% and 50% of the domestic consumption of these&#13;
fuels.&#13;
1.18          Nuclear power plants account for 26% of installed generating capacity. The 14 Soviet-&#13;
designed operating units include two RBMK graphite moderated reactors at Chernobyl of 2 x 1000 MW&#13;
nameplate capacity.  The recommissioning of a third fire-damaged unit at Chernobyl is being&#13;
contemplated. Construction of three new nuclear units in Zaporozhye, Rovno and Khmelnitsky, each&#13;
1000 MW of capacity, is in progress at varying degrees of completion. Sunk investments costs and the&#13;
increasing costs of non-nuclear electricity generation are powerful incentives to complete these units. The&#13;
April 1986 Chernobyl accident brought to the forefront the issue of the safety of nuclear plants (see&#13;
Annex 2). The G-7 Summit Meeting held at Naples in July 1994 called for the phased closure of the&#13;
Chernobyl plant and outlined a broad Action Plan to this effect, including the completion of three new&#13;
nuclear reactor units to adequate safety standards, the rehabilitation of non-nuclear power plants, energy&#13;
policy reform, and energy efficiency measures. The Ukrainian Government agreed to work with the G-7&#13;
to develop the details of the Action Plan (see Section D below).&#13;
1.19          The forced separation of the UPS, in November 1993, from the hydro plants on the Volga&#13;
river that controlled system frequency, revealed some serious structural and functional weaknesses with&#13;
negative consequences on overall system operation, security, reliability and quality of power supply.&#13;
Most of the plants in the UPS are base-loaded, with limited load-following capabilities, and the system&#13;
lacks peaking and spinning reserve capacity. Inability of the UPS to maintain the balance of supply and&#13;
demand in real time, as measured by the system frequency and power flows through the interconnections&#13;
with the neighboring systems, led to the separation of all neighboring systems, causing further&#13;
deterioration of system performance and reduction in export capacity. The existing peaking capacity is&#13;
provided by the hydro plants that are old and in need of rehabilitation. A decrease in hydropower&#13;
capacity would lead to further deterioration in the reliability and quality of electricity supply. In view&#13;
of unmet load-following requirements and the high share of base-load plants, it is also necessary to&#13;
enhance the regulating capacity.&#13;
1.20          There are nine major hydropower plants in Ukraine, located on the two largest rivers,&#13;
Dnieper and Dniester, with more than 25 km3 of total active volume of the reservoirs. The total average&#13;
annual runoff of the rivers is 63.4 km3, the power capacity of the associated power plants is 4535 MW,&#13;
and the total electricity production is about 10,750 GWh. The reservoirs are mainly low-head structures,&#13;
with maximum heads ranging from 12 to 38.7 m. A cascade of eight plants is located on the Dnieper&#13;
river, and one plant is on the Dniester (with two new plants under construction). The reservoirs were&#13;
developed for multiple purposes. Operation of the reservoirs is, therefore, subject to many and often&#13;
competing requirements, but is, to a large extent, determined by the electricity generation needs. The&#13;
following summarizes the most important data:&#13;

1.21           The severely inadequate capacity to regulate frequency in Ukraine has led to frequency&#13;
levels that are not only unacceptable by international standards but also damaging to rotating electric&#13;
equipment both in the consumption and generation side. Sometimes frequency drops below 49.0 Hz,&#13;
while most well-operated systems would not allow frequency fluctuations of more than +/- 0.01 Hz.&#13;
Owing to the damage done to electric equipment by substandard frequency, nuclear plants are normally&#13;
taken out of service when frequency drops below a certain level (this is set at 49.0 Hz in Ukraine). Yet,&#13;
these plants are kept on-line, even when frequency falls below the set point, because the authorities are&#13;
loath to substitute lost nuclear plant with fossil fuel (more expensive) generation. Thus the safety of the&#13;
nuclear plants is compromised. Therefore, enhancing the system's ability to better balance supply and&#13;
demand, and improve frequency regulation, would have significant nuclear safety benefits.&#13;
1.22           The current control system consists of a hierarchical, four level dispatch and supervision&#13;
system, and local automatic control subsystems at various facilities. At the top level of the dispatch&#13;
system is the National Dispatch Center in Kiev, linked to the eight regional dispatch centers, to some&#13;
hydro plants, and to 750 kV and 330 kV substations. The regional dispatch centers are connected to&#13;
power plants located within their respective regions, and to the local distribution centers (27 in total).&#13;
They also control the local 330 kV network and 330/110 kV substations. At the lowest, fourth level, are&#13;
single generating units at the plants, and district distribution centers, connected with the local distribution&#13;
centers. The system operation planning procedures are generally adequate, although there is space for&#13;
improvements. Computer models are used for the analysis of system performance and optimization of&#13;
regimes. The software, most of which is not portable, has been developed mainly in the central institutes&#13;
of the FSU and delivered without the source codes and, therefore, cannot be maintained and upgraded&#13;
locally. The real-time operation of the system is controlled manually, using telephone connections&#13;
between dispatchers in central and regional dispatch centers, and plant and substations operators. The&#13;
existing data acquisition and communication system is incomplete, and largely obsolete. No automatic&#13;
generation control or automatic load control is used.  Although these weaknesses are somewhat&#13;
counterbalanced by the high technical competence of the staff, the weaknesses inevitably contribute to&#13;
the low quality of electricity supply and operation inefficiencies.&#13;
1.23           The power transmission and distribution networks in Ukraine operate at levels of 0.4, 6,&#13;
10, 20, 35, 110, 150, 220, 330, 400, 500, 750 kV AC; there is also an 800 kV DC link with Russia.&#13;
Transmission levels are defined as 330 kV and above, while 220 kV and lower voltage networks belong&#13;
to distribution. Ukraine has interconnections with Central Europe (capacity 2000 MW), Russia (3900&#13;
MW AC, 200/250 MW DC), Romania/Bulgaria (3500 MW), Belarus (1000 MW), with a total effective&#13;
power transfer capacity that exceeds 20% of the domestic generating capacity. In general, capacity of&#13;
the transmission network is sufficient, particularly under the current conditions of lower consumption and&#13;
reduced electricity trade. The 750 kV network was designed to become the main transmission network,&#13;
to serve Ukraine and to export electricity from Ukraine and Russia to Central Europe. Power flows&#13;
through Ukraine used to go from East to West, but now go in the opposite direction. Load on the 750&#13;

kV lines is often light, and there is a problem of compensating the reactive power the lines generate.&#13;
Other than for some local interventions (building a new substation instead of the one at Chernobyl,&#13;
connecting the Dniester Pump Storage Plant, still under construction, to the 750 kV lines), there does not&#13;
seem to be a need for major new additions to the network in the short-to-medium term.&#13;
1.24         Electricity demand is expected to drop even further before it starts growing again, due&#13;
to a number of factors such as the general economic downturn, electricity price increases and economic&#13;
restructuring (see Annex 1). An analysis of least-cost investment options was conducted for the 1995-&#13;
2010 period (see Annex 3). The analysis assumed that the Chernobyl units will be decommissioned in&#13;
the 1997-2001 period, and thermal power units of 1525 MW capacity are retired in the 1996-2002 period.&#13;
The safety upgrade of all nuclear units was also assumed (the upgrade requires each unit be taken off line&#13;
for one year). The simulation of system operation showed that the marginal cost of generation in the&#13;
peak period was about 60% higher than the marginal cost of generation at the minimal load. The&#13;
completion of a pump storage plant on the Dniester river was consistently part of the least cost solution,&#13;
suggesting that the system needs the peaking capacity provided by hydropower plants. This preliminary&#13;
analysis also indicated that completing the nuclear units that are in an advanced stage of construction is&#13;
justified, and that, after these units are commissioned, there is no need for additional capacity until 2008&#13;
(i.e., there will be a period of several years with significant capacity surplus in the system). Given that&#13;
some of the plants are quite old, it may be more cost-effective to retire them earlier than indicated in&#13;
Minenergo's current retirement plan. Those old coal-fired plants that are not retired and the hydropower&#13;
plants will need to be rehabilitated. More details are provided in Annex 3.&#13;
1.25         Total power generation investment requirements are preliminarily estimated at US$3.5&#13;
billion in the 1995-2005 period. Of this total, US$1.9 billion is needed for nuclear power, including US$&#13;
0.6 billion for safety upgrades, US$ 0.6 billion for decommissioning and other works at Chernobyl, and&#13;
US$ 0.7 billion for the completion of three new nuclear units. The rehabilitation of thermal and&#13;
hydropower plants and the partial completion of the Dniester PSP requires about US$ 1.6 billion. About&#13;
half of total investment costs would be incurred in foreign exchange.&#13;
1.26         Ukraine has a significant power engineering and manufacturing base. The "Turboatom"&#13;
and "Electrotyazhmash" factories in Kharkov, for example, were among the largest producers of turbines&#13;
and generators in the FSU, with exports to many countries. However, domestic production capability&#13;
for some categories, notably high-voltage equipment, advanced power generating technology (gas&#13;
turbines, modern coal-burning technology, environmental protection equipment), and instrumentation,&#13;
control, commnunications and computing equipment, is limited or non-existent. Also, there seems to be&#13;
limited expertise available in modern computer-based software and methodology for system control, as&#13;
well as for least-cost investment planning and economic dispatch.&#13;
D. Governnent Policy and Strategy in the Power Industry&#13;
1.27         In 1992-93, the Government's reaction to the increase in the price of energy imports and&#13;
cost of energy supply was to rely on the methods of central planning such as price controls, cross-&#13;
subsidization among consumer classes, and the rationing of energy, rather than allowing market&#13;
mechanisms to regulate and balance supply and demand. The principal reason, presumably, was concern&#13;
about the political risk of increased unemployment inherent in market based solutions. Another prominent&#13;
concern is dependency on one supplier, Russia, for half of Ukraine's primary energy needs.&#13;
1.28         In late 1993, the Government prepared a "Concept for the Development of the Energy&#13;
Sector of Ukraine for the Period up to 2010". The "Concept" was subsequently approved by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Sector Background                                                                      9&#13;
Parliament. It spelled out the following main directions for Ukraine's long-term energy strategy: (i) the&#13;
development and implementation of a policy that promotes energy savings; (ii) economically and&#13;
environmentally justified utilization of domestic energy sources; (iii) restructuring of the economy that&#13;
reduces the energy intensity of production; and (iv) increasing reliance on alternative (renewable) energy&#13;
sources. The investment program outlined in the "Concept" recognized the priority of rehabilitating&#13;
capacities in the power, coal, gas and oil subsectors, however, it also included a number of ambitious&#13;
expansion schemes in coal mining, oil and gas production, and nuclear power generation.&#13;
1.29         In early 1994, the Parliament passed a Law on Energy Conservation. The Law provided&#13;
economic incentives for investments in energy conservation, including subsidies and earmarked loans.&#13;
Specifically, it called for the establishment of national and local extra-budgetary energy conservation&#13;
funds to support energy saving initiatives (however, it failed to specify the revenue sources of the funds).&#13;
The Law also contained a number of command-and-control type provisions such as penalties for "above&#13;
the norm" energy use.&#13;
1.30         "The Complex Program for the Modernization and Development of Fuel and Power&#13;
Industry of Ukraine for the Period up to 2010" prepared by Minenergo in 1992 (and revised in 1994)&#13;
focussed on the rehabilitation of thermal and hydropower plants in the 1995-2000 period. In addition to&#13;
extending the life of these plants, rehabilitation would be aimed at maximizing the use of domestic coal,&#13;
and improving plant reliability and environmental performance. Planned investments in new capacity in&#13;
the same period would include the completion of pump storage and nuclear plants currently under&#13;
construction. In order to meet the assumed increase in demand for electricity after 2000 (see Annex 1),&#13;
the "Complex Program" recommended the construction of additional nuclear and thermal power units&#13;
while continuing the rehabilitation and modernization of existing thermal and hydropower plants.&#13;
1.31         Both the "Concept" and the "Complex Program" included extensive measures to upgrade&#13;
the safety of nuclear power plants. The "Complex Program" assumed that the two remaining units of&#13;
the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant would be closed when their reactor channels reach the end of their&#13;
life in 1998-2003. During discussions with the G-7 Nuclear Safety Working Group, the Government&#13;
agreed to consider the possibility of the early closure of the Chernobyl plant provided that a solution was&#13;
found for a set of related issues, such as the financing of replacement nuclear capacity, closure costs, and&#13;
the mitigation of social consequences. It was agreed that an international Task Force would be formed&#13;
from Ukrainian and foreign experts with the task of developing a detailed, comprehensive Action Plan&#13;
for nuclear safety in the context of a power sector development strategy (see Annex 2). The joint&#13;
international Task Force was set up in December 1994, and its work is underway.&#13;
1.32         On May 21, 1994, the President of Ukraine signed Decree 244/94 on Market&#13;
Transformation Measures in the Electricity Sector of Ukraine (see Annex 4/A). The Decree ordered a&#13;
broad restructuring of the power industry based on the United Kingdom's model of separating generation,&#13;
transmission, and distribution functions, corporatizing and privatizing the generating and distribution&#13;
companies, setting up a competitive wholesale market for electricity, and establishing an independent&#13;
agency to regulate the industry (i.e., independent from the enterprises and not subordinated to any&#13;
Ministry). After some initial delay, the Government adopted an Action Plan to implement the Decree&#13;
on November 2, 1994 (see Annex 4/B). As a first step, a National Electricity Regulatory Commission&#13;
was established in December 1994. The Commission is expected to take over the regulation of electricity&#13;
prices from the Ministry of Economy in May 1995. Full implementation of the Decree is expected to&#13;
increase the efficiency and reliability of electricity supply, restore the financial health of the industry, and&#13;
create a favorable framework for private investment (including equity participation) in power generation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                                        Sector Background&#13;
1.33         In response to the growing problem of interenterprise arrears, the President of Ukraine&#13;
signed a Decree on October 12, 1994 ordering electricity and gas suppliers to agree on a schedule for&#13;
the reduction of arrears with their customers.  The Decree created an Interministerial Operative&#13;
Commnission to supervise the fulfillment of these agreements, and to ensure that supplies are maintained&#13;
to the highest priority customers in the critical winter period. The electricity and gas suppliers are&#13;
required to report non-payments to the Operative Commission, and the Commission's task is to take&#13;
appropriate steps to remedy the situation, including ordering the utilities to reduce or discontinue service&#13;
to delinquent customers.&#13;
E. Bank Strategy and Experience&#13;
1.34         The Bank's overall objective is to support Ukraine's efforts to accelerate structural&#13;
reforms, and to promote efficient investments in high priority sectors in order to complete the transition&#13;
of the country to a market economy, accelerate the rate of economic growth, and increase efficiency.&#13;
This will require strengthening key financial institutions; accelerating privatization; extending the&#13;
openness of the policy environment; rehabilitating and re-orienting its physical infrastructure; and&#13;
extending the social safety net and the efficient delivery of social services. This cannot and need not be&#13;
done at the expense of the stabilization effort; in fact, many efficiency measures such as infrastructure&#13;
cost recovery are likely to be revenue enhancing.&#13;
1.35         The Bank approved the first loan for US$27 million equivalent to Ukraine in June 1993&#13;
(Ln. 3614-UA) to finance an Institution Building Project aimed at supporting enterprise reform, financial&#13;
sector reform, and public economic and financial management. Initially, the implementation of the&#13;
project suffered from the unstable policy environment in Ukraine. Major bottlenecks have been: (i)&#13;
Ukraine's inexperience with Bank policies and procurement procedures; (ii) the project structure (three&#13;
components and eight implementing agencies, many different Bank staff involved); (iii) lack of guidance&#13;
from an understaffed and demotivated Implementation Unit; and (iv) an adverse attitude toward&#13;
interagency collaboration within the Ukrainian government.  Institutional rearrangements and the&#13;
improved policy environment significantly improved the performance of the project in late 1994.&#13;
1.36         The second Bank operation is a Rehabilitation Loan (Ln. 3831-UA) of US$500 million&#13;
equivalent approved in December 1994. The Loan provides financing for critical imports needed to stem&#13;
the decline in production and to cushion the deterioration of living standards of the population.&#13;
1.37         The Bank has been involved in the Ukrainian energy sector since early 1992. An Energy&#13;
Sector Review (Report No. 11646-UA) was issued in 1993, leading to an Energy Strategy Conference&#13;
held in Kiev in June 1993. During the Conference, an understanding was reached that the Bank would&#13;
focus on power generation, gas transmission, and gas distribution, since these were the subsectors where&#13;
the the Bank's contribution to policy development and financing of priority investments could make a&#13;
significant difference. It was also determined that lending operations should aim at the rehabilitation of&#13;
existing assets rather than capacity expansion, while supporting initiatives that increase the financial and&#13;
operational autonomy of enterprises and foster competition. Immediately after the Conference, the&#13;
Government, assisted by the Bank and other multi- and bilateral agencies, started the preparation of a&#13;
number of projects to rehabilitate hydropower plants, thermal power plants, gas transmission lines, and&#13;
gas distribution and metering facilities. In 1993-94, the Bank also assisted the Government to prepare&#13;
projects for coalbed methane utilization and district heating end-user efficiency improvements for possible&#13;
financing under the greenhouse gas reduction initiative of the Global Environment Fund. The Bank&#13;
recognizes that it will not be able to provide all the required foreign exchange to the power industry.&#13;
Additional funding will be needed from other sources such as EBRD, suppliers' credit and private investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Sector Background                                                                        11&#13;
1.38         Utilizing trust funds, the Bank provided technical assistance in the areas of industrial&#13;
energy audits, rehabilitation of thermal and hydropower plants, gas distribution and metering, legislation&#13;
for oil and gas production, and power industry institutional reform. Decree 244/94 (see above) is one&#13;
of the regulatory and legislative acts that benefitted from these technical assistance activities. Following&#13;
the approval of the Decree, the Bank, jointly with Minenergo, organized a donor meeting in Kiev in July&#13;
1994. The purpose of the meeting was to ensure the availability of adequate technical assistance for the&#13;
implementation of this important reform initiative in the power subsector. The donors offered technical&#13;
assistance of about US$4 million equivalent for the first year of the reform (including US$450,000 from&#13;
the Bank's Institutional Development Fund), and asked the Bank to assist the Government to coordinate&#13;
the implementation of the technical assistance program. The proposed project would both capitalize on&#13;
the reforms undertaken under the Decree, and provide leverage for its further implementation.&#13;
1.39         The Bank has been actively supporting the dialogue between the G-7 and the Government&#13;
of Ukraine in the area of nuclear safety. In collaboration with EBRD, the Bank assisted the G-7 Nuclear&#13;
Safety Working Group to develop an Action Plan that includes the phased closure of capacity at&#13;
Chernobyl, the completion of replacement nuclear capacity, the safety upgrade of the remaining nuclear&#13;
units, the rehabilitation of non-nuclear power plants and energy efficiency improvements. The Bank is&#13;
also actively participating in the work of a joint Ukraine/G-7 Task Force (para. 1.31) that is entrusted&#13;
with the technical preparation of the details of the Action Plan. Although the Bank will not finance&#13;
nuclear power investments, the Bank's support for pricing and institutional reforms is an important&#13;
contribution to the establishment of a framework that will facilitate the implementation of the Action Plan.&#13;
Furthermore, such projects as the proposed Hydropower and System Control Project, which will also&#13;
positively affect the safety of the operation of the nuclear plants (para. 3.24), and the planned Thermal&#13;
Power Rehabilitation Project, are key elements of the Action Plan.&#13;
1.40         A review of several decades of the Bank's worldwide lending for the power industry&#13;
found a declining trend in the industry's pricing, financial, technical and institutional performance, mainly&#13;
due to governmental failure to address the industry's fundamental structural problems ("The World Bank's&#13;
Role in the Electric Power Sector", World Bank Policy Paper, Washington DC, 1993). Conflicts between&#13;
the government's role as owner and its role as operator of utilities have led to poorly defined objectives,&#13;
government interference in daily affairs, and a lack of financial autonomy. The review recommended&#13;
that Bank lending for electric power should focus on countries with a clear commitment to improving the&#13;
performance of the power industry by commercialization, corporatization and the establishment of a&#13;
transparent regulatory framework. The Bank's experience in power rehabilitation is limited since there&#13;
were very few purely rehabilitation projects. To the extent that rehabilitation components can be&#13;
evaluated separately, performance has been satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                                               The Project&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Concept and Objectives&#13;
2.1           The Bank's Power Demand and Supply Options study issued in 1993 (Report No. 11561-&#13;
UA) examined a number of supply scenarios to meet projected electricity demand in the 1994-2010&#13;
period. The study found that, apart from the completion of the nuclear power and pump storage units&#13;
already under construction, no new generation capacity is needed, and the rehabilitation of thermal and&#13;
hydropower plants was likely to result in the most significant net benefits. Based on this finding,&#13;
feasibility studies were initiated to prioritize Minenergo's thermal and hydropower rehabilitation programs&#13;
and to prepare projects that could be financed by development banks. The hydropower study also&#13;
included assessments of the Dniester Pump Storage Plant (PSP) and system-wide control and dispatch&#13;
facilities. The studies were carried out by consultants whose activities were facilitated and supervised&#13;
by counterpart teams appointed by Minenergo. The services of the consultants were financed from trust&#13;
funds provided by the Government of Netherlands and the Government of Switzerland.&#13;
2.2           The draft final reports for the two studies were submitted to Minenergo and the Bank- in&#13;
early September 1994. The hydropower study (prepared by SGI Engineering Ltd) identified high priority&#13;
investments to rehabilitate the hydropower plants and to upgrade system control facilities. In addition,&#13;
it also recommended the completion of the Dniester PSP. However, the preparation of the Dniester PSP&#13;
lacked a proper environmental impact assessment and there was a need to revise the implementation&#13;
schedule to take into account the expected availability of funds.&#13;
2.3          The results of the feasibility studies were reviewed in detail by Minenergo and the Baik.&#13;
It was agreed that the Government would: (i) request a loan for a Hydropower Rehabilitation and Systeril&#13;
Control Project; and (ii) continue the preparatory work on thermal power rehabilitation and thi&#13;
completion of the Dniester PSP for eventual consideration for financing by the Bank. The appraisal ot&#13;
the project took place in September/October 1994.&#13;
2.4           The objectives of the project are to: (i) improve the efficiency, reliability, safety and&#13;
environmental performance of hydropower plants; (ii) increase hydropower generation capacity; (iii)&#13;
improve the quality of electricity supply by upgrading load and frequency control, which would also&#13;
improve the safety of nuclear plants; and (iv) reduce fuel costs by facilitating the economic dispatch of&#13;
generating units.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
2.5           The project includes the following four components:&#13;
(a)    The initial 5 years of the hydropower rehabilitation program outlined in the feasibility&#13;
study, including the implementation of the complete rehabilitation program for the&#13;
Dnieper I and Dnieper II hydropower plants and the Kiev PSP; near-complete&#13;
implementation of the rehabilitation program for the Kakhovka HPS; and partial&#13;
implementation of the rehabilitation program for the Kiev, Kanev, Kremenchug and&#13;
Dniprodzerzhinsk hydropower plants;&#13;
(b)    Installation of dam safety monitoring systems at the main water reservoirs on the Dnieper&#13;
river (Kiev, Kanev, Kremenchug, Dnieper, Dniprodzerzhinsk, Kakhovka);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                                13&#13;
(c)    Upgrade of communications, dispatch, system control and protection, and generating unit&#13;
control; and&#13;
(d)    Technical assistance for project implementation, and optimization of the use of the&#13;
reservoirs on the Dnieper river.&#13;
2.6           Rehabilitation of Hydropower Plants.  Hydropower plants play a critical role in&#13;
regulating peak load and system frequency.  Most of the existing plants are old and in need of&#13;
rehabilitation (eight of the nine main hydro plants are older than 20 years; five are older than 30 years;&#13;
the oldest plant, Dnieper I, was built in 1932 and then reconstructed in 1947). Many units have problems&#13;
with turbine runners and governors, generator windings and auxiliaries, oil leakage, substations circuit&#13;
breakers, load control, and instrumentation and control systems. This has lead to increased operating and&#13;
maintenance costs, derating of the units, and lower efficiency and availability.  Allowing further&#13;
deterioration would increase costs, worsen the capacity mix, and further reduce the already insufficient&#13;
regulating capability of the system.&#13;
2.7           The work involves:&#13;
Replacement of turbine runners, turbine governors, and replacement, rehabilitation or&#13;
upgrade of other related equipment (guide vanes, runner chambers, shafts, servomotors&#13;
measuring and control devices) at the Kiev, Dnieper I and Kakhovka plants. Only eight&#13;
out of twenty turbines at the Kiev plant will be rehabilitated due to the limited capaciiv&#13;
of the turbine manufacturer (the Kharkhov turbine factory, which produced most of tc&#13;
original turbines for the plants); the other twelve will be included in the second phase of&#13;
the rehabilitationprogram. Four out of six turbines will be rehabilitated at the Kaklrovl.d&#13;
HPS, where only one tubine at a time can be taken out. At the Dnieper I HPS. all&#13;
turbines will be included in the project.  Rehabilitation of one turbine both at&#13;
Kremenchug and Dniprodzerzhinsk plants will also be included.&#13;
*      Rehabilitation of generators including replacement, rehabilitation or upgrade of stator and&#13;
rotor windings, magnetic static core, generator circuit breakers, excitations and cooling&#13;
systems, voltage transformers and electrical protection.  All the generators that are&#13;
associated with rehabilitated turbines will be rehabilitated too; in addition, generators at&#13;
the Kiev PSP and Dnieper II, where no turbines are planned for rehabilitation, will also&#13;
be included in the project. All generator circuit breakers will be replaced in all plants.&#13;
*      Rehabilitation of switchyards and related equipment (step-up transformers, circuit&#13;
breakers, isolators and earthing switches, HV instruments and protection, current and&#13;
voltage transformers) at the Dnieper I, Dnieper II, Kakhovka, Kremenchug,&#13;
Dniprodzerzhinsk and Kiev plants, and the Kiev PSP.&#13;
*      Upgrading of control and monitoring equipment at the Dnieper I, Dnieper II, Kakhovka&#13;
and Kiev plants, and the Kiev PSP. The work consists of rehabilitating, replacing or&#13;
upgrading instruments for monitoring temperature, vibrations, generator air gap, water&#13;
discharge, and equipment for local, unit and plant-level control.&#13;
2.8           Installation of Dam Safety Monitoring Systems. Reservoirs on the Dnieper river were&#13;
developed with multiple uses in mind. In addition to hydropower generation, the reservoirs are used for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                                                 The Project&#13;
flood control, irrigation, industrial and drinking water supply, shipping, fisheries, tourism. Because of&#13;
the configuration of the terrain, the reservoirs are low head structures with long embankments. Some&#13;
of them have long dykes protecting the surrounding land from being flooded. The project includes&#13;
measures to rehabilitate and upgrade the existing dam monitoring systems for about 100 km of dams and&#13;
dykes for the reservoirs on the Dnieper river. The work will include dam safety investigation, and&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrade of the existing, as well as installation of new instrumentation (primarily&#13;
pressure, motion and moisture sensors, water levels, etc.), drainage structures and alarm systems. Data&#13;
collection, analysis and storage, automation and centralization of the readings where justified, will also&#13;
be considered.  Procedures for dam safety monitoring and emergencies will be reviewed and, if&#13;
necessary, improved, including emergency response, evacuation and training programs.&#13;
2.9           Upgrade of Communications, Dispatch and System Control. Low level of automation&#13;
across the entire UPS, outdated and inadequate protection, control, metering, communication and&#13;
computing equipment compromise system operation. At present, the frequency is regulated manually,&#13;
but deviations below 49.3 occur during the peak hours, and above 50.2 Hz during the low load hours (for&#13;
comparison, the UCPTE standard requires the system frequency to be maintained at 50.0 Hz within the&#13;
band of + or - 0.01 Hz). The response time of primary regulation is slow. The governors have large&#13;
dead bands, and were made using old technology with hydraulic amplifiers and vacuum tubes. Load&#13;
following scheduling is also done manually, rather than by computer-based economic dispatch, resulting&#13;
in extra fuel costs. Production scheduling of hydro generators, which are all peaking units, is controled&#13;
manualy. The control of power flows across interconnections with the neighboring systems is subject to&#13;
similar problems as the control of frequency (manual control, unstable voltage conditions), creating major&#13;
obstacles to reintegrating the UPS with its neighbors. Isolated operation, in addition to preventing the&#13;
trade of electricity, also reduces reliability, security and quality of supply, and is more expensive as it&#13;
requires a larger reserve capacity.  The operation of the planned power pool (the spot market for&#13;
electricity) will require the improved metering of interconnections, generating plants, power supply&#13;
companies and wholesale customers. Bids and availability forecasts from the generators will have to be&#13;
collected and evaluated. The data acquisition and communication system must be able to support the real-&#13;
time operations of the pool by providing accurate and timely information for production scheduling,&#13;
billing and compensation of the pool members.&#13;
2.10          The following measures are designed to answer the above problems:&#13;
*      Upgrading of generating unit governors: in addition to the new governors installed at the&#13;
hydro plants (included as a component in the hydropower rehabilitation program), new&#13;
governors will be installed at a number of thermal generating units. The governors will&#13;
be equipped for manual, local automatic and remote control allowing the implementation&#13;
of real-time economic dispatch by the National Dispatch Center.&#13;
*      Upgrade of plant protection, plant dispatch and generation control equipment at the&#13;
Dniester hydropower plant.&#13;
*      Upgrade of protection systems for the high-voltage transmission lines.&#13;
*      Installation of the necessary computing equipment to support automatic generation control&#13;
and economic dispatch at the National Dispatch Center.&#13;
*      Upgrading the data acquisition and transmission systems at the National Dispatch Center,&#13;
the Regional Dispatch Centers, and at a number of generating plants and important&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                           15&#13;
substations by installing modem remote terminal units and more powerful computer&#13;
systems. The upgrade will increase volume and frequency of data available to the&#13;
dispatchers enabling better monitoring of the system and more timely reactions, and allow&#13;
the implementation of automatic generation control and economic dispatch functions, as&#13;
well as effective functioning of pool operations. The system will be implemented as a&#13;
modular, open architecture system, which can be expanded in stages.&#13;
Upgrading the communication system by replacing the existing links representing the&#13;
most serious bottlenecks. The communication system is essential for the real-time control&#13;
and operation of the power network. The existing analog system has serious limitations.&#13;
The communication lines (cables, power line carriers and radio) are old, unreliable,&#13;
susceptable to noise corruption, and increasingly difficult to maintain. The bandwidth&#13;
of the communications links is not adequate. Given the size of the Ukrainian power&#13;
system and the corresponding communication requirements, this component will be&#13;
designed to enable functioning of the new SCADA and automatic frequency control&#13;
systems, laying down elements of the new communication system which will be gradually&#13;
expanded over time.  Detailed proposals for the location and type of the new&#13;
communication lines will be determined in the detailed engineering design stage in&#13;
conjunction with engineering specifications of the SCADA and automatic frequency&#13;
control systems.&#13;
2.11         International Waterways. The Dniester hydropower plant is about 15 km upstream from&#13;
the point where the river forms the borderline between Moldova and Ukraine. There is no dispute&#13;
between the two countries concerning the operation of this plant. Upgrading of the dispatch and&#13;
generation control equipment for this plant will not affect the reservoir nor any other water retaining&#13;
structure, and will have no effect on the flow of the river.&#13;
2.12         Technical Assistance. Project implementation support will compensate for the limited&#13;
experience of the beneficiaries in international procurement and the management of foreign contractors.&#13;
It will include support for preliminary detailed engineering design, technical specifications, bidding&#13;
document preparation, bids evaluation, contract negotiations, contract administration, cost control,&#13;
schedule monitoring and coordination, establishment of communication and documentation procedures,&#13;
supervision of detailed design development, construction inspections, inspections in manufacturers'&#13;
facilities, quality control, system checkout and integration in factory and on site, factory and field&#13;
acceptance tests, and other project implementation services. The technical assistance will also include&#13;
review of the existing procedures in managing the river basin reservoirs for the Dnieper river, and&#13;
proposals for the improvements, if necessary. Training will be included in the tender documents for the&#13;
supply of equipment. In addition, training will be provided in project management and procurement.&#13;
It is estimated that 160 man-months of internationally recruited, and 526 man-months of local consulting&#13;
services will be needed.&#13;
C. Project Context&#13;
2.13         The components of the project were chosen to address some of the most pressing&#13;
problems in the Ukrainian power system, and to maximize the impact of the Bank's contributions. The&#13;
least cost power investment plan includes the rehabilitation of a number of existing thermal and&#13;
hydropower plants, and the completion of three nuclear units and the pumped storage plant that are&#13;
already in an advanced stage of construction (see Annex 3). The proposed project is in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's energy strategy which aims at promoting energy efficiency improvements and adaptation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                                                     The Project&#13;
energy utilities to the requirements of a market economy (see Energy Sector Review, Report No. 11646-&#13;
UA). Increased efficiency in electricity generation will reduce fuel costs and improve the balance of&#13;
payments. The improved quality of electricity supply, a basic input for production, will facilitate the&#13;
modernization of Ukraine's industry. By increasing the efficiency of electricity generation, this project&#13;
is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy.  Together with the planned Thermal Power&#13;
Rehabilitation Project, the proposed project demonstrates that the Bank is willing to step up assistance&#13;
to those sectors of the economy that are committed to reform. This is particularly important at this time&#13;
when the power industry is making the first bold reform steps. The Bank's involvement is regarded as&#13;
important in supporting the implementation of high priority investments under the present conditions of&#13;
severe resource constraints. By rehabilitating and upgrading facilities that utilize a renewable resource,&#13;
the project is consistent with the objective of environmentally sustainable development. Finally, the&#13;
project is also consistent with the nuclear safety initiative of the G-7 since it supports the continued&#13;
utilization of a low-cost alternative source of power, and improves the safety of existing nuclear units by&#13;
reducing fluctuations in frequency.&#13;
D. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.14           The impact of the hydropower rehabilitation component (environmental category "B") was&#13;
reviewed during the preparation of the feasibility study. Other project components were placed in&#13;
category "C", not requiring specific environmental analysis. The main environmental problem detected&#13;
by the enviromnental analysis carried out for the feasibility study was excessive leakage of lubricating&#13;
oil from turbine runner blade seals. The study recommended the control of water pollution through the&#13;
rehabilitation of turbines, and also identified the need for improved water management, and improved&#13;
instrumentation and procedures related to dam safety. The conceptual design and structural stability of&#13;
water retaining structures were found to be satisfactory.&#13;
2.15           During implementation, the project is not expected to impose any costs on the&#13;
environment. Reservoir structures will not be subject to any work. There will be no activities that would&#13;
result in a significant impact on the existing patterns of water flows and water usage. Environmental&#13;
benefits will come from three sources: (i) the rehabilitation of turbines; (ii) the rehabilitation and upgrade&#13;
of dam safety systems; and (iii) economic dispatch. The turbines of which the runners will be replaced&#13;
were built between 1947 and 1964. The rehabilitated turbines are expected to have improved and longer-&#13;
lasting sealing, which should significantly reduce or eliminate the leakage. In addition, improved turbine&#13;
efficiency will lead to more hydro energy produced. Since the marginal source of power in Ukraine is&#13;
fossil fuel, this will translate to reduced fossil fuel use with corresponding environmental benefits.&#13;
Improved dam safety monitoring will reduce the risks of accidents and allow for improved water&#13;
management and control, which will also take environmental aspects into account. Introduction of&#13;
automatic generation control and economic dispatch will lead to a more efficient use of fossil fuel plants,&#13;
resulting in commensurate reduction in fossil fuel use and the corresponding emission of pollutants.&#13;
E. Cost Estimates and Financing&#13;
2.16           Project Costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$190.2 million equivalent,&#13;
of which US$106.7 million is in foreign exchange. Cost estimates are based on September 1994 prices.&#13;
Physical contingencies were estimated at 15% of base costs. Price contingencies for foreign costs were&#13;
estimated using a constant price increase of 2.2% per year. Price contingencies for local costs were&#13;
estimated assuming that the currently low domestic prices would increase in real terms in the future.&#13;
Assumptions on domestic inflation and exchange rate are given in para. 3.11. Based on information from&#13;
the Ministry of Finance that imports under the proposed project would be exempt from import duties and&#13;
&#13;

2.17          Project Financing. The proposed World Bank loan of US$114.0 million would cover&#13;
50% of project costs, plus US$18.3 million of interest during construction (the foreign exchange&#13;
component of total interest during construction estimated at US$ 24.1 million equivalent). Following a&#13;
five year grace period, repayment of the principal and interest payments would commence and continue&#13;
for 12 years. The Borrower would be Ukraine, whose Government would enter into subloan agreements&#13;
with the beneficiaries.   The beneficiaries would be the National Dispatch Center and  the&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo (DHE), a joint stock company that includes the hydropower plants on the Dnieper&#13;
river. During negotiations, the delegation confirmed that the loan proceeds would be on-lent to the&#13;
beneficiaries. The subloans would have a maturity of 1 7years includingfive years of grace. The interest&#13;
rate in the subloan agreements would be equal to the World Bank's standard variable interest rate plus&#13;
a margin of 1. 5 % to cover the cost of loan administration. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by&#13;
the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries would also reimburse the Government for the commitment fee (para.&#13;
6.1.a). The signing of the subloan agreements would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2.a).&#13;
2.18          The Government of Switzerland will provide a grant of US$10.5 million to finance part&#13;
of the cost of the hydropower rehabilitation component and related technical assistance services. The&#13;
proceeds of the Swiss grant (except the technical assistance component) will be on-lent to DHE at terms&#13;
that are similar to the terms in the above subloan agreements. The Government of Canada will provide&#13;
grant financing for technical assistance for project preparation, procurement and project implementation&#13;
for the first year (1995), in the amount of US$ 1.8 million. The Government of Norway will finance&#13;
the water management component of technical assistance in the amount of US$0.6 million, also on a grant&#13;
basis. DHE and NDC will finance the remaining costs, part of interest during construction, and the&#13;
commnitment fee, estimated at US$88.3 million equivalent, from internally generated revenues. Financing&#13;
arrangements are shown in Table 2.2.&#13;

III. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Electricity Prices&#13;
3.1    Electricity prices for residential consumers and the average price of electricity are set by the&#13;
Ministry of Economy. Electricity prices for non-residential consumers (within the prescribed average)&#13;
are set by Minenergo following the approval of the Ministry of Economy. Although the average nominal&#13;
price of electricity increased almost 50 times (on average) in 1993, when expressed in a convertible&#13;
currency, the price remained very low (see Table 3.1). Significant real increases occured in 1994 and&#13;
early 1995, almost fully eliminating the gap between the average price (UScent 2.5/kWh equivalent in&#13;
March 1995) and the economic cost of electricity (estimated at UScent 3.0/kWh)'. The prices cover the&#13;
operating cost of the industry, and the difference between the average price and the economic cost is&#13;
mostly due to the relatively low cost electricity produced by hydropower plants.&#13;

3.2            Hydropower companies sell their output to the National Dispatch Center (NDC) under&#13;
a two-part, cost-based rate structure designed to recover operating costs and capital expenditures,&#13;
including a pre-determined profit margin. Hydropower costs are generally low, although tariffs vary&#13;
significantly from one hydropower company to the next, reflecting differences in capital costs and&#13;
social/community infrastructure. Minenergo adjusts rates for the sale of hydropower to NDC on a&#13;
monthly basis. The cost of hydropower constitutes a small item (less than 1 %) in the overall retail&#13;
electricity tariff. In March 1995, NDC's average cost of purchasing power from the hydropower&#13;
companies was Krb 542/kWh (UScent 0.5/kWh equivalent). NDC paid Krb 1,860/kWh for the output&#13;
of nuclear plants, and sold the electricity purchased from the nuclear and hydropower plants to the eight&#13;
regional associations at a price of Krb 1,900/kWh. The regional associations combined this with the&#13;
electricity produced in their own thermal power plants, added the cost of transmission and distribution,&#13;
and sold the electricity to the public at an average price of Krb 3,105/kWh.&#13;
3.3            After an eight-fold increase that was implemented on March 1, 1995, retail electricity&#13;
prices were set at Krb 3,500/kWh for urban, Krb 3,000/kWh for rural households, and Krb 2,300/kWh&#13;
for households who rely on electrical stoves and space heaters (see Table 3.2). Several categories of&#13;
households (e.g., veterans, Chernobyl victims) are entitled to substantial discounts. The tariff for rural&#13;
households and electric stoves/heaters inverted the cost structure, since the supply of electricity to&#13;
households is generally more expensive due to a number of factors (e.g., household consumption&#13;
coincides with peak demand, higher distribution losses, etc). Additional distortions are caused by the lack&#13;
of time-of-day, seasonal and regional differences in electricity prices (only the capacity charge for large&#13;
industrial consumers differed regionally).&#13;
1      The low economic cost (in international comparison) is explained by (i) decreasing electricity demand resulting in&#13;
surplus capacity; (ii) access to relatively low cost imported fuels; and (iii) low labor costs.&#13;

3.4           The Government of Ukraine indicated in its Memorandum of Economic Reform Policies,&#13;
supported by the Rehabilitation Loan (Ln. 3831-UA), that wholesale electricity prices would be set by&#13;
the market by the end of 1995. Building on the existing national dispatch operation, the wholesale&#13;
electricity market (Energomarket) will allow thermal generators to submit bids for the sale of electricity&#13;
to the "pool" in each hour of the day. Those bids will be accepted which allow demand to be served at&#13;
minimum cost. A national wholesale price for the electricity generated by thermal plants, equal to the&#13;
highest accepted bid plus a margin ("uplift") to finance the operating cost of NDC, and certain other&#13;
costs, will be formed each hour, and charged to the local electricity companies and to those large&#13;
industrial consumers, who participate in demand side bidding and purchase electricity directly from the&#13;
pool. All entities who purchase from the "pool" will pay an additional transmission fee based on the cost&#13;
of delivering electricity to their respective locations.&#13;
3.5           Nuclear and hydropower plants will not participate in supply side bidding.  NDC&#13;
(Energomarket) will continue to buy electricity from the nuclear and hydropower plants on the basis of&#13;
contracts that will ensure the optimal dispatch of their capacity and full recovery of their costs. Local&#13;
electricity companies will be allocated a share of this low cost electricity. The operation of the wholesale&#13;
market, the prices paid to the nuclear and hydropower companies, and the formulation of retail electricity&#13;
prices will be regulated by the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) that was established&#13;
in December 1994.&#13;
B. Past Financial Performance of the Implementing Agencies&#13;
3.6           National Dispatch Center.  NDC is the sole purchaser of output from Ukraine's&#13;
hydropower and nuclear plants. This output is resold to Ukraine's eight regional power companies, who&#13;
currently engage in both distribution and thermal power generation, and to a few large industrial concerns&#13;
that purchase power directly from NDC. NDC's resale tariffs are determined by Minenergo and reflect&#13;
certain cross-subsidies that cause tariffs to vary from one regional company to the next. Overall, NDC's&#13;
average resale tariff is designed to cover its cost of service -- a goal that has not been fully achieved&#13;
during the recent years of high inflation and accumulating payment arrears. Had NDC been collecting&#13;
its accounts receivable in a timely manner, its resale tariffs would have been adequate and it would be&#13;
in a stable financial position today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial and Economic Analysis                                                          21&#13;
3.7           NDC's revenue stream depends almost entirely upon payments by the regional power&#13;
companies (Energos). These companies are in serious financial difficulty and have amnassed substantial&#13;
arrears to their suppliers, including NDC. Accounts receivable at the end of the third quarter of 1994&#13;
were approximately US$49.5 million at the then-applicable exchange rate of 68,000 Krb/US$. The&#13;
average age of NDC's receivables is about 60 days, down from 96 days in 1993. This improvement was&#13;
entirely attributable to inflationary devaluation of receivables. Many of NDC's outstanding 1994&#13;
receivables were recorded when the exchange rate was around 45,000/US$, and the company had, as of&#13;
September 30, 1994, suffered an economic loss of over US$25 million from the devaluation of its&#13;
uncollected receivables. Accounts receivable make up more than 99% of NDC's current assets; cash&#13;
balances in bank accounts are only about US$ 0.2 million equivalent.&#13;
3.8           Delays in collection left NDC unable to pay its own suppliers in a timely manner.&#13;
Devaluation of these payables created an inflationary gain of US$ 13 million as of September 30, 1994,&#13;
partially compensating for NDC's inflationary losses on receivables. NDC's gains from inflation were&#13;
substantially less than its losses because its payable balances were approximately 52% of its receivables,&#13;
and NDC's delay in making payments was less than its delay in collecting customer accounts (36 days&#13;
versus 60 days in 1994). Roughly 2.5% of NDC's current liabilities reflect amounts owed to hydropower&#13;
stations; 97.5% reflects debt for purchases of nuclear power. NDC is not encumbered with any short-&#13;
term borrowing.&#13;
3.9           NDC's situation reflects the broader problems in Ukraine's power industry:&#13;
*     In most of 1993 and in the first nine months of 1994, retail electricity tariffs lagged&#13;
behind fuel price increases, remaining too low even to fully reimburse operating costs,&#13;
let alone capital items and a profit margin; and&#13;
*     On average, 22% of the regional companies' billings to retail customers have not been&#13;
paid in a prompt manner since 1992. Because of high inflation, deferred payments&#13;
effectively spelled non-payment, given a legal framework that prevented the application&#13;
of interest charges and penalties to unpaid customer balances.&#13;
3.10          Hydropower plants. The hydropower plants had a relatively modest cash-flow problem&#13;
almost entirely attributable to delayed payments by NDC. The cumulative US$0.5 million receivable&#13;
owed by the NDC as of September 30, 1994 represented about 13 % (or 45 days) of the annual revenue&#13;
stream of the hydropower companies, constraining their ability to finance essential maintenance and&#13;
investment. Accounts payable, the only current liabilities of the hydropower companies, were below the&#13;
amount that the NDC owed to them.  Hydropower output is seasonal, with revenue collection&#13;
concentrated in the first half of the year, whereas costs are incurred more evenly over time. Thus there&#13;
is a risk of a revenue shortfall when costs continue to experience inflation that has not been adequately&#13;
reflected in prior months' rate-setting process. Minenergo was able to counter this problem in 1994&#13;
through monthly tariff adjustments that recovered the actual costs over whatever volume was produced&#13;
in a given month. For this reason, hydropower tariffs were subject to significant monthly fluctuations.&#13;
Compared to other sources of electricity, however, hydropower remained a low-cost source of power.&#13;

C. Future Financial Performance of the Implementing Agencies&#13;
3.11            Financial projections for Dniprohydroenergo and NDC for the period 1995-2001 have&#13;
been prepared and are presented in summary form in Tables 3.3-3.8, and in detail in Annex 6. The key&#13;
assumptions include:&#13;
*       the general rate of inflation in Ukraine will be 90%  in 1995, 34.5%  in 1996, 19.6%  in&#13;
1997, 12.7% in 1998, 6.2% in 1999, and 5% in 2000-2001;&#13;
*       the Krb/US$ exchange rate will be 140,000 in 1995, 165,000 in 1996, 180,142 in 1997,&#13;
191,253 in 1998, 199,766 in 1999, 205,842 in 2000 and 212,103 in 2001;&#13;
*       electricity demand will follow  the medium  scenario (see Annex  1) and electricity&#13;
generation will be according to the least cost plan (see Annex 3);&#13;
*       electricity produced by nuclear plants will be sold at a price of US$ 0.015/kWh (this is&#13;
expected to ensure the full recovery of operating costs, safety improvements, the&#13;
completion of ongoing investments, and financing of the decomissioning of the Chernobyl&#13;
plant);&#13;
*       following the completion of the proposed project, the hydropower plants will need to&#13;
generate local funds of US$ 8 million equivalent annually in the year 2000 and beyond,&#13;
in order to finance other investments;&#13;
*       in contrast to its current practice of purchasing only surplus thermal power supplies from&#13;
the regional companies, NDC (Energomarket) will purchase all output from the new&#13;
generating companies applying market-based (marginal-cost) pricing after mid-1995. The&#13;
average price of thermal power will be US$0.020/kWh in 1995, gradually increasing to&#13;
US$ 0.025 in 2000; and&#13;
*       NDC increases its working capital in 1995 through a modest increase in tariffs.&#13;

3.12              Based on these assumptions, in order to generate enough funds to cover the local costs&#13;
of the project, the projected price of hydroelectricity (approximately Krb 480/kWh in 1995) would have&#13;
to increase to Krb 935/kWh in 2000, equivalent to less than UScent 0. 1/kWh throughout the project&#13;
period, based on the forecast exchange rate for those years. The price of electricity sold by NDC has&#13;
already been increased from UScent 0.4/kWh in 1994 to UScent 1.52/kWh; for the year as a whole the&#13;
average price would have to be increased to UScent 1.91/kWh (most of this increase represents increases&#13;
in the costs of power, as well as a provision for bad debt, an increase in working capital, and the&#13;
financing needed for the local cost of investments). The average price of electricity sold by NDC is&#13;
projected to increase only 8% in dollar terms between 1995 and 2000. The project would lower the cost&#13;
of electricity production following its completion in the year 2000, thereby reducing retail electricity&#13;
prices in the long run.&#13;

3.13             Apart from water inflows, the financial performance of the Dniprohydroenergo is affected&#13;
by (i) the price it receives for electricity; and (ii) its collection ratio. Even after the reform of the power&#13;
industry is implemented, hydropower plants will be obliged to sell their output under long term contracts&#13;
at cost-based (below-market) tariffs. There is no substitute for the essential services such as frequency&#13;
control and peaking that these plants provide. In consideration of the service obligation that they bear,&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo would, under standard regulatory practice, receive a guaranteed rate of return. Due&#13;
to Ukraine's special problems with payment discipline, this guarantee should encompass provisions&#13;
ensuring timely payment. During negotiations, it was agreed that the contract between NDC and&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo would include the following (para. 6.1. b):&#13;
*       a cost-based tariff formula that (i) includes the regular adjustment of cost data to reflect&#13;
inflation; (ii) compensates for seasonal and annual fluctuations in hydropower output due&#13;
to external circumstances; (iii) ensures that sufficient funds are available to finance the&#13;
cost of agreed investments (including the proposed project); and (iv) encourages efficient&#13;
operation and maintenance of the hydropower plants; and&#13;
*       a guarantee of prompt payment within 20 days of billing, backed by an interest penalty&#13;
if delay occurs. The interest penalty will be calculated applying the National Bank&#13;
Refinancing Rate.&#13;
The signing of a suitable contract would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2.b).&#13;
3.14             NDC's arrears to hydropower plants make up only 2.5%  of its current liabilities. Thus&#13;
the hydropower plants' current problems could be fully resolved in the near term without substantially&#13;
altering NDC's financial position. A one-time resolution of NDC's outstanding trade debt for hydropower&#13;
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2. c).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Financial and Economic Analysis                                                                         25&#13;
3.15            In the medium term, a more fundamental solution that addresses the underlying problem&#13;
of non-payments to NDC will be required, including appropriate provisions in NDC's resale contracts&#13;
as well as improvement of the regulatory and institutional framework within which NDC will operate.&#13;
An agreement was reached during negotiations that new contracts between NDC (Energomarket) and its&#13;
downstream purchasers would include the following terms (para. 6.1. c):&#13;
*       NDC will be entitled to charge an interest penalty on accounts receivable that become&#13;
past due (i.e., not paid within 20 calendar days of receiving the bill). This penalty will&#13;
be based on the National Bank Refinancing Rate. These penalties shall be immediately&#13;
due and payable at the time they are assessed, and shall be entitled to the same priority&#13;
of collection as any other account receivable; and&#13;
*      NDC will be entitled to make proportional reductions in deliveries to customers who have&#13;
not settled their accounts in full within 30 days of billing. Specifically, on the 20th day&#13;
after billing, NDC (Energomarket) will notify such customer that (i) his account is past&#13;
due and interest penalties have begun to accrue; and (ii) specify the portion of deliveries&#13;
that are liable to termination unless full payment (including accrued interest penalties) is&#13;
made. Proportional cutbacks will go into effect on the 10th day following the notice&#13;
(i.e., the 30th day after the original billing), and remain in effect until the customer's&#13;
past-due account, including interest penalties, is settled in full. Contracting parties will&#13;
agree that NDC (Energomarket) shall be held harmless for any damages, of whatever&#13;
type, resulting from a proportional cutback that has been carried out in accordance with&#13;
these stated conditions.&#13;
3.16            These provisions are expected to make it feasible for NDC to reduce both its accounts&#13;
receivable, and the delay when paying its suppliers. During negotiations, it was agreed that (i) ADC's&#13;
delay in paying its suppliers would be reduced to 45 days in 1995, 30 days in 1996, and 20 days&#13;
thereafter; and (ii) NDC's accounts receivable would not exceed 60 days in 1995, 40 days in 1996, 35&#13;
days in 1997, and 30 days thereafter (para. 6. 1.d).&#13;

3.17            Ukraine's financial and regulatory accounting standards currently do not provide for&#13;
explicit recognition of bad debt. During negotiations, the Bank and the delegation agreed that the price&#13;
setting mechanism would allow the National Dispatch Center to recover an allowance for bad debt in its&#13;
resale tariffs, currently estimated at 10%  of revenue in 1995, 7.5%  in 1996, 5%  in 1997-98, and 2.5%&#13;

thereafter (para. 6.1. e). A similar provision will not be needed in hydropower tariffs, as the contract&#13;
between the NDC and Dniprohydroenergo will provide for prompt payment in full.&#13;
3.18            In order to ensure adequate levels of self-financing of capital investments and a feasible&#13;
financing plan, an agreement was reached during negotiations that NDC and Dniprohydroenergo each&#13;
would generate for every financial year beginning in 1996 sufficient internal funds to cover not less than&#13;
40% of the annual average capital expenditures expected (or actually incurred) for that financial year,&#13;
the previous financial year, and the next financial year (para. 6.1 .ff   In order to ensure that&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo and NDC are capable of servicing their total borrowing requirements, it was agreed&#13;
during negotiations that Dniprohydroenergo and NDC would maintain a debt service coverage ratio of&#13;
at least 1.5 during the project period (para. 6.1.fl.&#13;
3.19            Profits for NDC are projected to be relatively uneven in the early years of project&#13;
implementation even though tariffs stay fairly constant in dollar terms. This is in part a reflection of the&#13;
forecast collection performance for 1995 (much of which will have transpired before loan effectiveness)&#13;
requiring slightly higher tariffs in order to maintain adequate cash flow. Part of the delayed payments&#13;
will become realized in 1996, significantly increasing the company's cash flow and allowing for a&#13;
permanent increase in working capital. Faster than expected reduction of NDC's accounts receivable in&#13;
1995 would allow for smoother profits and cash flows.&#13;

D. Financial Analysis of the Project&#13;
3.20            A financial analysis was carried out for the hydropower rehabilitation component in order&#13;
to determine whether it was in Dniprohydroenergo's financial interest to undertake the proposed&#13;
investments. The estimated after-tax Financial Intemal Rate of Return (FIRR) on incremental financial&#13;
cash flows -- defined as the difference between the "with" and "without" project situations and expressed&#13;
in current US dollars -- is 16 %. Details of the FIRR calculations, including the assumed electricity prices&#13;
and taxes, are provided in Annex 7. There was no financial analysis carried out for the system control&#13;
component, since the quantified benefits -- fuel savings derived from more efficient economic dispatch -&#13;
- do not accrue to the National Dispatch Center. Nevertheless, as described in Section C above, the&#13;
contracts between NDC and its downstream customers are expected to ensure the full recovery of the&#13;
investment costs of this component.&#13;

E. Economic Costs and Benefits&#13;
3.21          An economic evaluation, based on incremental costs and benefits, was performed for each&#13;
subcomponent and then aggregated for the two main components and the project as a whole. The&#13;
summary results are shown in Table 3.9. Details of the economic analysis are presented in Annex 8,&#13;
together with key assumptions. All costs are expressed in 1994 constant economic prices, net of taxes&#13;
and subsidies. The discount rate assumed for the economic analysis is 10%. The evaluation period is&#13;
1995-2020.&#13;

components for which no benefits were quantified.&#13;
3.22          Hydropower Rehabilitation Component. The least cost investment analysis presented&#13;
in Annex 3 suggests that there is a lack of peaking capacity in Ukraine, and preserving the existing&#13;
peaking capacity is of high priority.  In order to analyze the economic viability of hydropower&#13;
rehabilitation in more detail, Net Present Values and Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRR) were&#13;
calculated by comparing the economic cost and benefit streams of a "with project" and a "without&#13;
project" case. The "without project" case assumes continued operation of the units at a progressively&#13;
deteriorating level of efficiency and availability. The plant operating parameters for the two cases and&#13;
other assumptions are presented in Annex 8. The main quantified benefits are: (i) improvements in the&#13;
efficiency of turbines and generators; (ii) reduction in operating and maintenance costs as a result of&#13;
better instrumentation and plant control; and (iii) improvement in plant reliability and availability through&#13;
the reduction of forced and planned outages. As a result of improved efficiency and availability,&#13;
electricity production is estimated to increase (on average) by 567 GWh annually compared to the&#13;
scenario where no rehabilitation is undertaken, equivalent to 5.5 % of the average production of the plants&#13;
in 1991-93. Incremental electricity sales were valued at the estimated economic value of peak power&#13;
(which is 35 % higher than the average economic value of electricity). The plant-by-plant EIRRs range&#13;
from 11 % to 31 %, indicating that the proposed rehabilitation is economically viable for each plant (see&#13;
Table 3.10 below). The detailed plant-by-plant economic analysis is presented in Annex 8.&#13;
3.23          System Control Component. The benefits of this component derive mainly from greater&#13;
efficiency in the loading (automatic economic dispatch) of power units and improved power flow in the&#13;
system. As a result of the upgrade of communications, dispatch and system control, about 11,000 MW&#13;
of thermal capacity will become available for more efficient dispatching.  These benefits were&#13;
approximated by cost reduction resulting from fuel savings. Since the proposed upgrade measures&#13;
represent a significant advance over the present system, fuel savings are expected to be substantial. For&#13;
the purpose of this analysis, fossil fuel savings of 0.25 Mtoe/year were conservatively assumed&#13;
(equivalent to 3% of the expected fuel consumption of these plants in 1994). The EIRR for this&#13;
component was estimated at 22.7%.&#13;

3.24          Non-quantified Benefits.  The above-quantified benefits are regarded as a minimum&#13;
measure of the true economic benefits conferred by the project. Additional, non-quantified benefits of&#13;
the hydropower component include: (i) life extension of the plants (thereby deferring replacement); (ii)&#13;
improved environmental performance as a result of reduction in lubricating-oil leakage from old turbine&#13;
blade seals and reduced risk of flooding as the monitoring of dams improves; (iii) plant safety&#13;
improvements resulting from the upgraded instrumentation and control system; and (iv) consumer surplus&#13;
associated with incremental electricity sales. Non-quantified benefits from the system control component&#13;
include: (i) increased stability and security of the power system, which reduces unserved energy (due to&#13;
fewer blackouts and faster restoration of service); (ii) improved frequency control, which extends the&#13;
lifetime of rotary equipment connected to the network, and enhances the safety of nuclear plants (high&#13;
trequency fluctuation causes structural damage to rotating equipment, including safety-related equipment,&#13;
thus potentially compromising operational safety); and (iii) facilitation of Ukraine's future interconnection&#13;
with the neighboring power pools, opening the possibility for electricity exports.&#13;
F. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
3.25          Calculations were carried out to analyse the sensitivity of the economic viability (proxied&#13;
by the EIRR) of the two main components and the entire project to (i) a 10% investment cost overrun&#13;
(for both components); (ii) a 10% decrease in the economic value of electricity produced (for the&#13;
hydropower component); (iii) a 10% decrease in the amount of fossil fuels saved (for the system control&#13;
component); and (iv) all of the above. Additionally, switching values (values at which the NPV is zero&#13;
and the EIRR is 10%) were calculated for investment costs (for both components), electricity price (for&#13;
the hydropower component), and fuel savings (for the system control component). The results are&#13;
presented in Table 3.11. Project economic returns are very robust relative to the indicated variations in&#13;
key project parameters. The switching value analysis suggests that project costs do not pose a significant&#13;
risk because both components remain economic even in the face of considerable overruns in investment&#13;
costs. The hydropower rehabilitation component remains economically viable even at 58% of the&#13;
assumed economic value of electricity. Due to the high base-case level of economic returns, the system&#13;
control component retains economic viability even when fuel savings amount to 41 % of the level assumed&#13;
for the base case.&#13;

IV. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
4.1           Implementation of the project will be the responsibility of the beneficiaries, i.e., the&#13;
recently formed joint stock company Dniprohydroenergo and the National Dispatch Center (NDC). The&#13;
five hydropower plants under Dniprohydroenergo have maintained their role in day-to-day management,&#13;
however, all commercial functions such as financial management, accounting, contract negotiations, etc.&#13;
have been moved to the headquarters of the new corporation. In December 1994, Minenergo issued a&#13;
resolution for the consolidation of the regional dispatch centers under NDC by mid-1995. During&#13;
negotiations, it was agreed that the transfer of ownership of the regional dispatch centers to NDC would&#13;
be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2.d). The consolidation is not expected to result in major&#13;
changes (traditionally, NDC has been responsible for the operational control of the regional dispatch&#13;
centers). Although it is expected to remain a 100% state owned enterprise, the role of NDC will change&#13;
significantly when it becomes the commercial (as well as operational) center of the Ukrainian Power&#13;
System. As Energomarket, it will purchase pratically all electricity from the generators, and sell it to&#13;
the local electricity companies responsible for distribution and final sales to the consumers.&#13;
4.2           Dniprohydroenergo. In 1989, hydropower plants were taken out of the regional power&#13;
utilities, organized into six enterprises, and placed under the direct supervision of Minenergo. The six&#13;
enterprises formed a Hydropower Association. The Association was not a commercial entity, but a forum&#13;
through which certain activities were coordinated among the hydropower plants. It did not have its own&#13;
accounts, budget, nor (full time) employees. In early 1995, five out of the six enterprises were combined&#13;
into Dniprohydroenergo, a joint stock company that is 100% owned by the state. The following five&#13;
enterprises became part of Dniprohydroenergo (the number of employees in parenthesis): Mid-Dnieper&#13;
Cascade (1,168), Kremenchug (204), Dniproderzhinsk (323), Dnieper (292) and Kakhovka (120). The&#13;
Mid-Dnieper Cascade included the Kiev HPS, Kiev PSP and Kanev HPS, the Dnieper enterprise included&#13;
Dnieper I and Dnieper 1I HPS (the other three enterprises were named after their plants). The sixth&#13;
enterprise became a separate joint stock company by itself (Dnistrohydroenergo).&#13;
4.3           The hydropower plants have very similar organizational structures. The Chief Engineer,&#13;
Deputy Director for Capital Investments (in some cases only a Senior Engineer for Capital Investments),&#13;
Deputy Director for Support Services and Production, and the managers of the departments for economic&#13;
analysis, accounting, and personnel report directly to the Director. The Chief Engineer is in charge of&#13;
all technical activities related to the operation of the plant, and typically supervises production and&#13;
dispatch, technical and operational divisions, and turbine, hydroelectrical, and electrical shops. "Support&#13;
services and production" includes the procurement division, transport and security, and often involve&#13;
some activities not directly related to the main business operation, but to the provision of social services&#13;
(e.g., day-care centers) or other production activities (e.g., agricultural production).&#13;
4.4           Dniprohydroenergo not only centralized the commercial functions of the individual&#13;
hydropower enterprises, but also assumed certain new functions. One of them that is of particular&#13;
importance to the project, investment planning, has previously rested with Minenergo. Although the&#13;
Ministry retained a strategic planning function, Dniprohydroenergo is in the process of establishing an&#13;
independent planning capability. The individual hydro plants retained a significant part of their existing&#13;
organizational structure, at least for some time. However, most of their staff performing functions that&#13;
are to be carried out at the corporate level (financial management, accounting, procurement, investment&#13;
planning, etc.) are expected to be moved to the corporate headquarters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation                                                                        31&#13;
4.5          Hydropower investment projects in the past have been managed by Minenergo through&#13;
its Department for Capital Construction, and Ukrhydroproekt, an engineering organization which also&#13;
belonged to Minenergo's structure. Ukrhydroproekt, with 700 employees, has been in charge of all&#13;
engineering design work for the previous hydropower projects. It will have a similar role in this project&#13;
as well, serving as the main local engineering and project management consultant to Dniprohydroenergo&#13;
and its Project Implementation Unit, as well as to the Project Coordination Unit (see below).&#13;
4.6          The National Dispatch Center. NDC has about 430 employees, organized in 12&#13;
departments (number of employees in parenthesis): Dispatch (22), Optimization of Energy Regimes (15),&#13;
Optimization of Network Regimes (20), Relay Protection and Automation (19), Long-Term Planning (8),&#13;
SCADA and Communications (31), Computing Equipment (50), Economic Analysis (11), Billing and&#13;
Collection, Government Audit, Maintenance, and Support Services. After the consolidation of the&#13;
Regional Dispatch Centers under NDC, NDC will take over most of the employees from the existing&#13;
eight regional power utilities who work at the Regional Dispatch Centers. It is expected that the number&#13;
of people transferred will be under 100 per region.&#13;
4.7          The dispatch and system control component of the project includes the purchase and&#13;
installation of several types of equipment (turbine governors, data acquisition, communications,&#13;
computers, software). The existing engineering systems at the dispatch centers were developed and&#13;
designed in the central institutions of the FSU. Some of them are no longer present in Ukraine, which&#13;
has led to loss of information and engineering know-how. Although there are local engineering&#13;
organizations with expertise in most of the equipment categories, there is no organization which could&#13;
cover the entire range of issues, perform engineering work and provide counsel on integrated systems&#13;
in power system control. This role will be performed by an international consultant under the technical&#13;
assistance component of the project.&#13;
4.8          Project Coordination.  A Project Coordination Unit (PCU), headed by a Project&#13;
Coordinator appointed by Minenergo, will be in charge of overall project coordination. The PCU,&#13;
located in Minenergo, will coordinate project preparation activities, technical assistance, scheduling (to&#13;
the extent that it requires coordination between the hydropower rehabilitation and the system control&#13;
components), reporting, training, and other aspects of project implementation requiring coordination&#13;
between the two project implementation units (see para. 4.9). The Project Coordinator will report to&#13;
Minenergo, and serve as a liaison to the Ministry of Finance and the Bank for project activities. He will&#13;
establish project communication and documentation procedures, oversee preparation of bid documents,&#13;
arrange appointment of bid evaluation committees, coordinate bidding and contracting, arrange for audits&#13;
of project accounts, and organize training in project management, project financial operations and&#13;
procurement.&#13;
4.9          Project Implementation. Two Project Implementation Units (PIU) will be set up with&#13;
responsibilities to manage implementation of the hydropower rehabilitation (including dam safety) and&#13;
the system control components. The PIUs will be responsible for managing the engineering aspects of&#13;
project implementation (preparation of bid-level design specifications, supervision and approval of&#13;
manufacturers' detailed design, inspection in manufacturers' facilities, construction supervision, quality&#13;
control, system checkouts and integration in factory and on site, factory and field acceptance tests), as&#13;
well as scheduling, procurement (including bidding and contracting, in coordination with the PCU),&#13;
payments and disbursement operations related to the respective project components. The PIU of each&#13;
company (Dniprohydroenergo and NDC) will manage the respective Special Account. The managers of&#13;
the PIUs will have the authority to clear payments to suppliers and contractors, after authorization from&#13;
site managers (see para. 4.10). The PIUs will be integral parts of the implementing agencies and will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                                         Implementation&#13;
consist of staff whose regular responsibilities include the implementation of investment projects. The&#13;
managers of the PIUs will be appointed by the Dniprohydroenergo and NDC, and will also have the title&#13;
of Deputy Project Coordinators of the PCU. The Deputy Project Coordinators will report to the Project&#13;
Coordinator and to the Director of the company that appointed them. During negotiations, it was agreed&#13;
that the Project Coordinator and the two Deputies would have qualifications acceptable to the Bank (para.&#13;
6. L.g). 7he establishment of the PCU and PIUs, and the appointment of the Project Coordinator and&#13;
Deputy Project Coordinators would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2. e).&#13;
4.10         Site managers will be appointed at each site where project subcomponents are to be&#13;
implemented. The site managers, appointed by the managers of the respective facilities, will serve as&#13;
liaisons between management of the facilities and the corresponding PIUs. They will participate in&#13;
monthly review meetings with the PIUs, attended by concerned project staff, to review progress, address&#13;
implementation issues and authorize payments to suppliers and contractors. Site implementation will be&#13;
handled within the existing organizational structure of the concerned facilities.&#13;
4.11         Installation of equipment will be the responsibility of the respective facilities (hydro&#13;
plants, dispatch centers, thermal plants and substations), which will use their force account and&#13;
specialized local construction and installation companies, under the guidance of the supplier (to be&#13;
included in the tender documents), with additional assistance from the international consultants providing&#13;
TA for project implementation. The supplier will supervise the erection and provide the necessary&#13;
training, and will assume responsibility for the performance of the equipment. There is sufficient local&#13;
capability to perform the installation. Hydroelectromontazh, with 500 employees, which specializes in&#13;
erection and installation of electrical equipment, has been the main contractor for this type of work to all&#13;
Ukrainian hydroplants. Another company, Spetshydroenergomontazh, with 800 employees, specializes&#13;
in installation of turbines and generators. Both companies have gained international experience through&#13;
a number of projects in non-FSU countries. Equipment installed at the Dniester hydropower plant, the&#13;
thermal power plants and substations will be owned by the National Dispatch Center and leased to the&#13;
plants and the transmission company. The installation and maintenance of the equipment will be the&#13;
responsibility of the thermal plants and the tramsmission company.&#13;
4.12         Technical assistance (TA) activities for the project have been subdivided into the following&#13;
components: (i) engineering design; (ii) procurement; (iii) project management; and (iv) water&#13;
management study. International consultants will be hired to assist local consultants and the Project&#13;
Management and Implementation Units with all TA components. The TA activities will be coordinated&#13;
by the PCU, which will sign and manage TA contracts both with intemational and local consultants. The&#13;
first three TA activities (engineering design, procurement, and project management) have started in&#13;
January 1995, and for the first year (1995) will be financed by the Canadian Government and performed&#13;
by a Canadian consortium. During this year, emphasis will be on assisting Dniprohydroenergo and NDC&#13;
in preparation of tender documents (including engineering design specifications), bid evaluation, contract&#13;
negotiations, and with other procurement issues. The activities of the consultants during this stage will&#13;
also include assistance in organizing the project management and implementation units, project&#13;
administration, planning and scheduling. A substantial involvement of international consultants will be&#13;
needed also during the second year of project implementation (1996), in advising the two companies,&#13;
PCU and PlUs in various aspects of project management, administration and implementation (planning,&#13;
scheduling, engineering, construction management, inspection, testing, commissioning, project&#13;
documentation, reporting, cost accounting). International consultants will be needed throughout the entire&#13;
project implementation period, although their involvement is expected to be much reduced after the&#13;
second year. In case grant financing for TA activities after 1995 could not be secured, the foreign&#13;
component of TA would be financed from the Bank loan, and consultants chosen according to the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation                                                                           33&#13;
Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency&#13;
(August 198 1).&#13;
4.13          The international consultants will work in conjunction with domestic consultants and the&#13;
staff of the companies assigned to the project. The international consultant providing TA for project&#13;
implementation will assign an Assistant Project Coordinator, reporting to the Project Coordinator, on a&#13;
full-time basis. The international consultant providing TA for procurement activities will assign a&#13;
Procurement Advisor, who is expected to be engaged full-time until the signing of the main contracts,&#13;
and will work on demand thereafter (about one third of the time). TA in project management,&#13;
supervision and quality control will be provided throughout the project.  Training sessions in&#13;
procurement, project management, financial management and quality control for project management and&#13;
implementation staff at PCU, PIUs and elsewhere (as needed) will be organized by international&#13;
consultants, in cooperation with the Project Coordinator, during the initial stages of project preparation&#13;
and implementation.&#13;
4.14          The technical assistance related to the management of the reservoirs on the Dnieper river&#13;
will be financed entirely by the Norwegian Government. This activity is expected to start by the end of&#13;
1995 and be completed in a two-year period. It will also involve both international and local consultants,&#13;
in which the international consultant(s) will take the lead. The recepient of this assistance will be&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo.&#13;
4.15          The technical assistance program (see Section I.E) supporting the implementation of&#13;
Decree 244/94 includes a number of institution building activities targeted at the beneficiaries of the&#13;
project. Dniprohydroenergo is receiving support for corporatization and development of organizational&#13;
structure, internal reporting, financial management, budgeting and planning. The establishment of&#13;
Energomarket on the basis of NDC is also supported, including the preparation of Energomarket&#13;
Members Agreement, bidding procedures, price formation software, dispatcher's manual and software,&#13;
and settlement procedures. Consultants are providing assistance for the preparation of contracts between&#13;
Energomarket and the nuclear and hydropower plants. A detailed study is scheduled to start in April that&#13;
will assess the metering and commnunications requirements for the operation of the "pool". These&#13;
technical assistance activities are financed by grants provided by the United Kingdom, United States,&#13;
Netherlands, Switzerland, and other donors.&#13;
B. Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.16          According to the Implementation Plan (see Annexes 9-13), the project will be&#13;
implemented over a period of 5 years and is expected to be completed by June 30, 2000. The&#13;
rehabilitation of turbines is on the critical path of the implementation of the hydropower rehabilitation&#13;
component. Installation of switchyard equipment, control and monitoring equipment and dam safety&#13;
systems, as well as system control and monitoring components, is expected to proceed without difficulties&#13;
since it involves work at existing sites. Consulting services under the technical assistance component&#13;
have started in January 1995, so that project implementation can proceed expeditiously after the loan&#13;
approval. A detailed implementation schedule is presented in Annex 9.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
4.17          The procurement for the project will consist of 11 packages for equipment and goods,&#13;
ranging from US$0.8 million to US$32.1 million with total aggregate value of US$91.4 million, and 2&#13;
packages for technical assistance activities, estimated at US$0.3 million and US$1.5 million, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                                         Implementation&#13;
A list of procurement packages is provided in Annex 10. All equipment and goods financed from the&#13;
Bank Loan will be procured according to the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loan and&#13;
IDA Credits (1992). Contracts for equipment and goods estimated to cost more than US$300,000 will&#13;
be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using Bank's Standard Bidding Documents.&#13;
Domestic manufacturers competing under ICB will be eligible for a 15% preference, or the prevailing&#13;
custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers (whichever is less) in bid evaluation, provided that they&#13;
can prove that value added to the product in Ukraine equals to at least 20% of the ex-factory price of the&#13;
bid. The preference shall be applied in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 2 of the&#13;
Guidelines. Small contracts for goods, US$300,000 equivalent or below, with an aggregate limit of&#13;
US$1.5 million, may be procured through international shopping, after obtaining a minimum of three&#13;
price quotations from at least three eligible countries. Direct contracting up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$1.0 million may also be allowed, if the procedure is justified (e.g., for items of proprietary nature&#13;
or items required to ensure compatibility with the already installed equipment, for spare parts available&#13;
only from the original supplier, etc.). Total amount of goods purchased through international shopping&#13;
and direct contracting will not exceed US$2.5 million (less than 3% of the Bank Loan available for&#13;
equipment and goods). List of goods to be purchased under these two procedures will be subject to prior&#13;
review by the Bank. Consultants, to be employed under the technical assistance component of the loan&#13;
if bilateral funds are not available, will be selected according to the Bank's Guidelines for Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981).&#13;
Project elements, their estimated cost, and proposed methods of procurement are summarized in Table&#13;
4.1.&#13;
4.18         Project implementing agencies in Ukraine have very limited knowledge of international&#13;
commercial practices and the Bank's procurement procedures. Procurement teams will be established&#13;
within the Project Implementation Units, and will receive training during the early stages of project&#13;
implementation, both from the Bank and from the consultants engaged under the technical assistance&#13;
component. To ensure compliance with the Bank guidelines, the following documents will be subject to&#13;
prior review by the Bank: draft tender documents, bid evaluation reports and recommendations for awards&#13;
of contracts, for all ICB procurement (US$300,000 and above) and all Bank-financed contracts awarded&#13;
under direct contracting/negotiation (covering about 98% of the total value of Bank-financed equipment&#13;
and goods); list of goods to be purchased through international shopping financed by the Bank; terms of&#13;
reference for all consulting contracts; all consulting contracts financed by the Bank above US$100,000&#13;
for firms, and above US$50,000 for individual consultants. All other contracts will be subject to ex-post&#13;
review.&#13;
4.19         The rehabilitation of turbines, stator and rotor windings and magnetic stator core for&#13;
generators are expected to be financed from local sources and procured by direct contracting with&#13;
domestic suppliers, Turboatom and Elektrotyazhmash. The Turboatom factory, producing turbines, has&#13;
about 10,000 employees, of which 2,500 have university degree. It has delivered turbines to more than&#13;
160 plants in 26 countries. The generator factory, Elektrotyazhmash has about 8,600 employees, of&#13;
which 2,140 are engineers. It has a long list of reference plants in more than 30 countries. The contracts&#13;
will contain sufficient guarantees for timely delivery of the contracted equipment and services,&#13;
performance, provisions for inspections and tests, pricing and warranties. The equipment under these&#13;
contracts, although not financed by the Bank, is critical for the overall project implementation and&#13;
operational performance. It was agreed during negotiations that Dniprohydroenergo would sign suitable&#13;
contracts, satisfactory to the Bank, with the turbine and generator manufacturers by November 30, 1995&#13;
(para. 6.1.h).&#13;

4.20           A General Procurement Notice was published in the Development Business Forum on&#13;
Nov. 16, 1994, allowing for more than the required 60 days prior to the issue of the bidding documents.&#13;
The General Procurement Notice will be updated and published annually. At least 45 days prior to the&#13;
issuance of bidding documents, individual bidding opportunities will be advertised in a major local&#13;
newspaper.  The project agencies would also be expected to advise known eligible and qualified&#13;
traditional suppliers.&#13;
4.21           Procurement information will be collected by the PCU and reported to the Bank as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)    prompt reporting of contract award information;&#13;
(b)    semiannual and annual reports that include (see also para. 4.29):&#13;
*      revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best&#13;
estimates of allowances for physical and price contingency;&#13;
*      revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract&#13;
award, and completion time for individual contracts; and&#13;
*      compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;

4.22          The Government is expected to prepare legislation instituting public procurement rules&#13;
and regulations as part of the program to transform the economy from a centrally planned to a narket-&#13;
oriented system based on the development of a competitive private sector. The Country Procurement&#13;
Assessment Report is expected to be prepared after legislation has been enacted and placed in effect.&#13;
D. Disbursement&#13;
4.23          The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed over five and a half years (1995-2000) on the&#13;
following basis:&#13;
(a)    100% of the foreign costs of imported equipment and goods;&#13;
(b)    100% of local ex-factory costs of supply of equipment and goods and 80% of local&#13;
expenditures for other items procured locally; and&#13;
(c)    100% of expenditures for consultancy services.&#13;
4.24          Table 4.2 shows the estimated disbursement profile for the project, as derived from the&#13;
implementation plan of the project components (Annexes 5 and 9); a more detailed disbursement schedule&#13;
is presented in Annlex I 1. The disbursement profile follows broadly the standard disbursement profile&#13;
for energy projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region. The Closing Date for the proposed loan&#13;
would be December 31, 2000.&#13;

firms under contracts not exceeding US$ 100,000 equivalent, and individual consultants not exceeding&#13;
US$ 50,000 equivalent would be made against statement of expenditures (SOE) in order to assist the&#13;
borrower in making timely payments. The supporting documentation for these contracts would not be&#13;
sent to the Bank, but would be retained by the borrower for inspection by supervision missions and by&#13;
external auditors.  All other disbursements would be fully documented.  The minimum  size of&#13;
applications for direct payments will be US$50,000.&#13;
4.26          To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish two Special Accounts&#13;
(one for the Dniprohydroenergo, the other for NDC) in commercial bank(s) on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Bank's share of expenditures. The authorized allocation to the&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo's Special Account would be US$2.0 million, and to the NDC's Special Account&#13;
US$2.0 million, representing about four months of average expenditures effected through the Special&#13;
Accounts. At the request of the Borrower and, based on project needs, the Bank would make initial&#13;
deposits into the Special Accounts up to the amount of the authorized allocation. Applications for the&#13;

replenishment of the Special Accounts would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has&#13;
been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow&#13;
the usual Bank procedures. In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Accounts which have&#13;
been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment applications. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached on the arrangements for establishmett, operation and auditing of the Special&#13;
Accounts (para. 6.1.i).&#13;
E. Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.27          Ukraine's electricity enterprises follow standard Soviet accounting procedures, which have&#13;
been augmented as required by the administrative reporting requirements of the many government bodies&#13;
to which they report. The financial accounting standard now in use is not adequate for providing reliable&#13;
management and regulatory reports. Revenues are reported on a cash basis, when received, and costs&#13;
associated with producing revenue are not booked until such time as revenues arrive. When accounts&#13;
receivable are not being collected, a substantial portion of costs are held off the books, misstating inconme.&#13;
A related problem is that neither of the beneficiaries is equipped to track its receivables and payables on&#13;
a dated basis, and thus there is no basis for calculating and recognizing inflationary losses. At present,&#13;
there is no recognition of uncollectible debt. In addition to maintaining the statutory accounts required&#13;
by Ukrainian law, the beneficiaries will maintain a parallel system of financial statements (income&#13;
statements, sources and uses of funds, and balance sheets) that meet international accounting standards&#13;
(IAS). The IAS accounts will supply data inputs suitable for use in tariff calculations and regulatory&#13;
reporting that will be required by the National Energy Regulatory Commission. They also will serve as&#13;
the basis for calculating interest penalties to be provided for under their new contracts, and for monitoring&#13;
progress in improving the timeliness of payments and collections. Financial statemnents will be audited&#13;
by an auditor acceptable to the Bank and the audit reports submitted to the Bank within six tmonths of the&#13;
end of each financial year (para. 6.1.j).&#13;
4.28          The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-related&#13;
accounts will be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. Annual financial&#13;
statements of IBRD-financed components will be prepared and audited in accordance with International&#13;
Auditing Guidelines by suitably qualified independent auditors acceptable to IBRD, and submitted to&#13;
IBRD within six months of the close of the GOU fiscal year. Audits will also be carried out, at the same&#13;
time, and for corresponding periods in accordance with the Bank guidelines, for SOEs against which&#13;
disbursements have been made or are due to be made out of the credit proceeds, and specific reference&#13;
to the Special Account (SA) and SOEs will be made in the audit reports accompanying the financial&#13;
statements. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the implementing agencies would submit&#13;
to the Bank the audit reports and auditedfinancial statements for the Special Account, project accounts&#13;
and SOEs for the every fiscal year, not later than six months after the close of such year. Agreement was&#13;
also reached that auditors acceptable to the Bank would be retained to review the accounting systems and&#13;
supporting internal procedures and practices for the Special and project Accounts and SOEs, and&#13;
recommend any needed changes (para. 6.1. i).&#13;
F. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.29          The Project Coordination Unit will prepare semiannual and annual project progress&#13;
reports. The progress reports, following clearance by the Borrower, will be submitted to the Bank. The&#13;
progress reports will include, but not necessarily be limited to, project physical progress, procurement,&#13;
disbursements, project costs, schedule, plan for next reporting period, the work of consultants, and&#13;
project administrative aspects. The progress reports will be sent to the Bank within four weeks after&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                                                                 Implementation&#13;
conclusion of the reporting period.  The first progress report will be sent three months after loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
4.30           The Borrower will submit a mid-term progress report, covering all components of the&#13;
project, no later than June 30, 1997. In addition to the topics covered by the semiannual reports, the&#13;
mid-term report will include an assessment of the status of loan covenants, overall institutional&#13;
performance of the companies-beneficiaries, and evaluation of the project based on a set of performance&#13;
indicators (Annex 12). This report will be reviewed with the Bank by no later than September 30, 1997,&#13;
and, based on the recommendations of the report and the Bank's views on the matter, measures will be&#13;
taken to ensure the efficient completion of the project. The timing of the mid-term review and the&#13;
performance indicators were agreed at negotiations (paras. 6.1.k, 6.1.1).&#13;
4.31           A project implementation completion report (ICR) will be submitted to the Bank promptly&#13;
after the completion of the project, but no later than 6 months after the Loan Closing Date. The ICR will&#13;
discuss execution of the project, its costs and benefits, the performance of the borrower, the World Bank&#13;
and other agencies involved, and lessons learned. The ICR will also contain evaluation of the project&#13;
performance indicators.&#13;
4.32           In addition to the review  of procurement actions, semi-annual reports and other&#13;
documentation, a number of supervision missions is planned.  The project is expected to require&#13;
supervision from the Bank at an average of 25 staff-weeks per year during the first two years of&#13;
implementation, and 15 staff-weeks per year thereafter (Annex 13).&#13;
G. Operation&#13;
4.33           Following project completion, the life of the hydropower plants will be extended by about&#13;
20 years. The operation of the rehabilitated plants is not expected to pose a technical challenge for the&#13;
well-educated, experienced staff working at the plants. The hydropower plants will continue to be the&#13;
lowest cost electricity generators in Ukraine, ensuring the long term financial viability of&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo. NDC, as the future Energomarket, will play a key role not only technically, but&#13;
also financially in the reformed power industry. NDC will operate the wholesale (spot) market for&#13;
(practically) all electricity generated in Ukraine, and recover its costs by adding a margin ("uplift") to&#13;
the price of electricity it sells to local electricity distributors/suppliers. The facilities installed by the&#13;
project will be essential for the successful functioning of the wholesale market, including daily bidding,&#13;
dispatching, metering, verification, and settlements.  Under the project, technical training will be&#13;
provided to NDC staff in the operation and maintenance of the modernized communications, system&#13;
control and dispatch facilities. A large donor funded institutional building effort that has been mobilized&#13;
in support of the power industry reform will provide the necessary training for NDC's commercial&#13;
functions. Suppliers will provide training the necessary training for the maintenance of the equipment&#13;
they supply and guarantee delivery of spare parts, both for Dniprohydroenergo and NDC. The operation&#13;
plans of Dniprohydroenergo and NDC were agreed at negotiations (para. 6.1. m).&#13;

Project Risks and Benefits                                                               39&#13;
V. PROJECT RISKS AND BENEFITS&#13;
5.1           Project Risks. The main risks for the project is the possibility that the Government&#13;
would be unwilling to (i) adhere to the agreed pricing formula for the electricity produced by the&#13;
hydropower plants; and (ii) implement a strict regulatory policy to prevent the further accumulation of&#13;
payment arrears. These could seriously undermine the financial position of the Dniprohydroenergo and&#13;
NDC, and thereby endanger the implementation of the project. The reform of the power industry based&#13;
on Decree 244/94 is expected to decrease these risks, but cannot eliminate them. The implementation&#13;
of the reform itself is subject to political risks. Risks arising from the pricing of electricity have been&#13;
addressed under the project by requiring the adoption of a tariff formula that includes all operating costs,&#13;
recovers investment costs, and allows for regular adjustment to reflect inflation. Risks arising from non-&#13;
payment by NDC's customers (i.e., local electricity companies and large industrial plants) have been&#13;
addressed by requiring appropriate contractual arrangements, including the reduction/termination of&#13;
service in the case of non-payment. The beneficiaries' inexperience in implementation of Bank projects&#13;
poses additional risks. Inferior performance of domestic equipment and domestic supply constraints could&#13;
also delay project execution and affect the quality of work. These risks have been addressed through the&#13;
careful planning of activities that are on the critical path, and by providing technical assistance to the&#13;
PIUs in procurement, supervision and quality control. Economic returns are very robust relative to&#13;
variations in key project parameters. A switching value analysis suggests that project costs do not pose&#13;
a significant risk because both major components remain economic even in the face of considerable&#13;
overruns in investment costs. The hydropower rehabilitation component remains economically viable&#13;
even at half of the assumed economic value of electricity. The system control component retains&#13;
economic viability even when fuel savings amount to one-third of the level assumed for the base case.&#13;
5.2           Benefits. The main benefits are improvements in the efficiency and availability of&#13;
hydropower plants, and the increased efficiency in the loading of hydro- and thermal power generation&#13;
units. Additional benefits are: (i) the increased security of the power system that will lead to fewer&#13;
blackouts; (ii) the improved stability of frequency that will enhance nuclear safety; (iii) the better&#13;
environmental performance of the hydropower plants that will reduce the pollution of rivers; and (iv) the&#13;
improved monitoring of dams and reservoirs that will reduce the risk of dam breaks.&#13;

UKRAINE&#13;
HYDROPOWER REHABILTIATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
ELECTRICITY DEMAND FORECAST&#13;
1.            Due to the large uncertainty surrounding the course of future economic changes in&#13;
Ukraine, alternative electricity demand projections were prepared by the Bank. Scenario A assumes a&#13;
comprehensive and radical reform process, including raising electricity tariffs to economic levels in the&#13;
near future and the strict enforcement of hard budget constraints for enterprises. By contrast, Scenario&#13;
B reflects very slow-paced reforms and restructuring, meaning that the completion of price adjustment&#13;
is much deferred and enterprise budget constraints remain soft. Importantly, the pressure on enterprises&#13;
to restructure towards a less electricity-intensive product mix and to use electricity more efficiently is&#13;
much weaker in Scenario B than in Scenario A. Scenario C tracks a middle course between these two&#13;
extreme outcomes by portraying a gradual, steady progress towards a market-based economy.&#13;
2.            Macroeconomic performance. In Scenario A, GDP recovers from the current slump&#13;
in 1996, and the economy is set to grow at relatively high rates (an average 5.5% per year over the 1996-&#13;
2010 period). In Scenario B, GDP continues to contract longer, the recovery is weak and the post-&#13;
recovery (1998-2010) growth rate, at about 3.5%, is lower. Scenario C is an intermediate case, with&#13;
an average growth rate of 4.5% per year in the post-recovery period of 1997-2010.&#13;
3.            Structural shifts in total output.  Ukrainian enterprises must make changes in their&#13;
product mix under any reform scenario. These shifts are assumed to benefit the less electricity-intensive&#13;
consumer industries, high technology manufacturing and services at the expense of the presently oversized&#13;
heavy industries. The structural transformation proceeds at various speeds in the three scenarios, the&#13;
fastest being in Scenario A and the slowest in Scenario B.&#13;
4.            Electricity price adjustment. In Scenario A, industrial electricity tariffs rise to the&#13;
economic level by the end of 1995, and the presently cross-subsidized tariffs (for households, communal&#13;
services, agriculture, etc.) reach the industrial level by the end of 1997.  The shift to economic cost&#13;
levels happens more gradually in the other scenarios.&#13;
5.            Price responsiveness. Consumer sensitivity to changes in electricity prices corresponds&#13;
to that of a reformed semi-market economy proxied by Hungary. Under Scenario A, the assumed short-&#13;
and long-run elasticities are -0.08 and -0.16, respectively. In Scenarios B and C, which reflect a weaker&#13;
sensitivity to costs, price elasticity is set at half of the above values.&#13;
6.            Methodology. For the purpose of the quantitative projection, a dynamic consumption&#13;
model was used (described in detail in the Ukraine Energy Sector Review, Report No. 11646-UA)&#13;
7.            Projections. The forecasts to the year 2010 are shown in Table 1 and Figure I (the&#13;
figures refer to gross consumption, i.e., they include station use and network losses; in recent years gross&#13;
consumption exceeded final, or net, consumption by about 20%). The recently experienced decline in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2&#13;
gross consumption (27% in the past four years) is projected to continue in the near future in all cases.&#13;
In Scenario A (High Case), the early economic recovery offsets a large part of the severe price shock&#13;
imposed on the industrial users, resulting in a relatively small decrease in consumption until 1997.&#13;
During the period 1998-2010, demand recovers at a rate of 3.4% per year, reaching the pre-crisis (1990)&#13;
reference level only towards the end of the forecast period. In Scenario B (Low Case), demand levels&#13;
out in 2000 at 64% of the reference level, followed by a slow recovery thereafter. Under Scenario C&#13;
(Medium Case), after bottoming out in 1997-98, demand growth resumes at 3% per year, but the 1990&#13;
consumption level is not reached even in 2010.&#13;

8.           Official Ukrainian demand forecast. The latest (May 1994) forecast prepared by&#13;
Minenergo and approved by the Government, predicts the future course of gross electricity consumption&#13;
under two alternatives. The low forecast differs from the high one on the assumption of efficiency gains&#13;
derived from the adoption of vigorous electricity conservation measures (in TWh):&#13;
1993       1995      2000       2005       2010&#13;

High forecast           227.2      228.1      256.0      278.0      295.0&#13;
The difference between the official and Bank forecasts is sizeable, although it narrows towards the end&#13;
of the projection horizon. The discrepancy is especially large for the medium term, largely because the&#13;
official forecast does not assume any drop in power usage for 1994 (the Bank projects a 14% decline)&#13;
and for the subsequent years. For 2005 and 2010, the Bank's High and Medium forecasts are&#13;
comparable with the conservation-centric official forecasts.&#13;

UKRAINE&#13;
HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
NUCLEAR SAFETY&#13;
1.           Nuclear power in Ukraine currently provides almost 40% of electricity generation and&#13;
represents 26% of installed capacity.  The 14 Soviet-designed operating units include 10 pressurised&#13;
water reactors of the VVER-1000 type, two older 440 MW units of the VVER 213 type, and two graphite&#13;
water reactors of RBMK-1000 type at Chernobyl. Four more VVER-1000 reactors are in an advanced&#13;
stage of construction at the Zaporozhye, Rovno, Khmelnitsky and South-Ukraine plants.&#13;
2.            The safety of nuclear reactors in Ukraine has been a major concern for the international&#13;
community. Especially serious doubts remain amongst international nuclear safety experts about the&#13;
safety of the RBMK reactors at Chernobyl (which account for 5% of total electricity generation).&#13;
Chernobyl Unit 4 was destroyed in April 1986 and is enclosed in a deteriorating concrete shelter&#13;
(sarcophagus).  Unit 2 has been shut down since the October 1991 fire in its turbine-generator block.&#13;
A safety review conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency in March 1994 found numerous&#13;
safety deficiencies in the two units which remain operational. Of particular concern are specific problems&#13;
in the design of the first generation Unit 1. These deficiencies include an insufficient emergency reactor&#13;
cooling system and vulnerability to serious failures, particularly from fires, as a result of poor diversity&#13;
and separation of electrical cables and equipment in the reactor control and protection systems. Unit 3&#13;
is a second generation RBMK reactor having significant safety improvements. However, it is in an&#13;
increased radiation environment emanating from the neighboring destroyed Unit 4. Although planned,&#13;
there is currently lack of safety-upgrading activities at Chernobyl.  Only limited safety-enhancing&#13;
measures were undertaken due to the original 1991 decision to terminate operations by the end of 1993.&#13;
In addition to these shortcomings at Chernobyl, most of Ukraine's nuclear plants suffer from inadequate&#13;
instrumentation and control and weaknesses in management and training. In 1994, the lack of financing&#13;
severely constrained the ability of Goskomatom (the nuclear operator) to carry out maintenance and to&#13;
undertake work to improve safety, including the procurement of up-to-date equipment and spare parts.&#13;
The loss of highly skilled personnel who moved to Russia because of higher compensation also had a&#13;
negative effect on safety. The price of electricity sold by the nuclear plants was substantially increased&#13;
in early 1995, alleviating somewhat the financing constraints.&#13;
3.           In response to mounting domestic and international safety concerns following the fire in&#13;
Unit 2, Parliament mandated that the Chernobyl plant should be closed by the end of 1993 and imposed&#13;
a moratorium on the completion of new nuclear units under construction. In November 1993, as a&#13;
consequence of the deterioration in the country's energy supply, Parliament revoked the order and&#13;
allowed continued operation as long as "technically feasible". Also, in February 1994 a presidential&#13;
decree was issued approving the recommissioning of Unit 2 in 1995.  According to current plans,&#13;
Goskomatom will decommission Chernobyl Units 1-3 when their reactor channels are exhausted, i.e, in&#13;
the 1997-2005 period.  The Government's plan also includes the completion of Zaporozhye 6,&#13;
Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 in 1995-1999 (the completion of South Ukraine 4 is hampered by the lack&#13;
of cooling water). The implementation of a program of measures to upgrade the safety of all operating&#13;
nuclear units is scheduled to start in 1995-96. And, as a matter of urgency, the construction of a new,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 2&#13;
structurally safe sarchophagus is planned for the destroyed Unit 4 at Chemobyl.&#13;
4.            The Ukrainian authorities indicated that they were prepared to consider and discuss&#13;
possible early closure of the Chernobyl plant, provided that a satisfactory solution was identified, in&#13;
particular, for financing replacement nuclear capacity, closure costs, including the mitigation of the social&#13;
costs of closure. In the dialogue with the G-7 Nuclear Safety Working Group, Ukraine suggested that&#13;
an international task force be formed from Ukrainian and foreign experts, including representatives of&#13;
the relevant international financial institutions, with the task of preparing a comprehensive nuclear safety&#13;
Action Plan in the context of a power sector development strategy.&#13;
5.           The G-7 Sunmmit Meeting, held at Naples in July 1994, called for the closure of the&#13;
Chernobyl plant as an "urgent priority". The meeting outlined a broad sectoral Action Plan for the&#13;
closure of Chernobyl, including the early completion of three nuclear reactors (Zaporozhye 6, Rovno 4&#13;
and Khmelnitsky 2) to adequate safety standards, comprehensive energy sector reformns, rehabilitation of&#13;
conventional power plants, increased energy conservation, and the use of alternative energy sources. The&#13;
G-7 offered to provide an "initial" amount of US$200 million in grants, in addition to the contribution&#13;
offered by the European Union (US$120 million in TACIS grants and US$480 million in long-term loans&#13;
from EURATOM). Support from the international financial institutions and other donors was also called&#13;
for.&#13;
7.           The dialogue between the Ukrainian authorities and the G-7 continues, notwithstanding&#13;
initial Ukrainian reservations about the inadequacy of the financial package offered at Naples. The joint&#13;
international task force was formed in December 1994 with a mandate to develop a detailed,&#13;
comprehensive Action Plan for nuclear safety, and its work is underway.&#13;

HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
LEAST COST POWER INVESTMENT PROGRAM&#13;
A. Methodology&#13;
1.    A least-cost analysis of the Ukrainian power system (UPS) expansion alternatives for the period&#13;
1995-2010 has been performed to assess future investment requirements of the system, and the type and&#13;
timing of new capacity additions needed. The main objective of the analysis was to investigate the need&#13;
for peaking units in the system, in order to assess the relative importance of the hydropower capacity as&#13;
the only peaking capacity present in the existing capacity mix. The analysis was carried out using the&#13;
WASP computer program'. The general methodology imbedded in WASP is focussed on finding the&#13;
least cost power system expansion plan that matches projected electricity demand while maintaining the&#13;
reliability of the system operation at a prescribed level. The model takes into account both maintenance&#13;
requirements and the operational reliability of generating units. The system costs include investment&#13;
costs, financing costs during construction, fuel costs, operation and maintenance costs, and costs of&#13;
energy not served.&#13;
B. Description of the Existing System&#13;
2.    The installed electricity generation&#13;
capacity of the UPS was 52,122 MW in&#13;
1993. It included 12,818 MW of nuclear&#13;
capacity, located in 5 plants with a total           Figure 1.1 Capacity Mix&#13;
of 14 units in operation.  There were&#13;
more than 40 thermal (fossil fuel) power                 4       &gt;&#13;
plants with conventional steam  cycle&#13;
technology, with over 110 generating                          X                     ch_   l&#13;
units and a total capacity of 32,364 MW,                                          FN&#13;
of which 3,824 MW were combined heat-&#13;
and-power units.  Hydro capacity was                          .                   U3I.dbi&#13;
4,700 MW, stationed mostly in 9 plants                     a&#13;
with a total of 100 generating units. The&#13;
capacity of industrial power plants was&#13;
about 2,240 MW. The total effective&#13;
generating capacity of the system was about 50,000 MW, due to the derating of older plants. Most older&#13;
fossil fuel plants (about 23,000 MW) used coal as their primary fuel, but needed gas or mazut for co-&#13;

run on gas or mazut as main fuels. Figure III.1 shows the capacity mix of the existing system.&#13;

228,316 GWh, of which thermal plants&#13;
produced 135,875 GWh, nuclear plants&#13;

transmission  and  distribution  losses&#13;
(22,473   GWh),  final  electricity&#13;
consumption came to 187,905 GWh. The peak demand in 1993 occurred in January, at 37,000 MW:&#13;
the minimum demand, in June, was about 17,000 MW. Heat production was about 48 million Gcal.&#13;
Total fuel consumption for electricity and heat production was 53 million tons of coal equivalent (tce,&#13;
defined as 7000 Kcal/kg), consisting of 19.4 million tce of natural gas, 7.3 million tce of mazut, and 26.3&#13;
million tce of coal (Figure III.3).&#13;
4.    Electricity generation, domestic consumption and exports have declined significantly in recent&#13;
years. Between 1990 and 1993, generation decreased by about 23 %, domestic consumption by 15 %, and&#13;
net exports by 96% (the decline is likely to continue for some time -- see Annex 1). GDP, however,&#13;
declined even more (37% in the same period), and the electricity intensity of GDP increased from about&#13;
1.95 kWh/US$ in 1990 (about 3.4 times the OECD) to 2.32 kWh/US$ in 1993.&#13;
C. Main Assumptions&#13;
5.    The main assumptions of the analysis concern system demand, unit retirement schedule,&#13;
commitments to rehabilitation of existing and addition of new units, fuel mix, electricity imports,&#13;
composition and characteristics of new generating units proposed for the system expansion, and various&#13;
cost components and parameters.&#13;
6.    Electricity Demand. Electricity demand scenarios were prepared by the World Bank (see Annex&#13;
1). To reflect the declining share of industrial consumption of electricity, the yearly load factors2 are&#13;
assumed to decline gradually from the present level of about 0.73 to 0.65 by year 2010, remaining at that&#13;
level through the rest of the planning period. The maximum yearly loads were derived from the energy&#13;
projections (Annex 1) and the load factors assumption. In addition to satisfying the peak loads, the&#13;
system has to have 15% reserve in capacity (the standard planning requirement for the UPS). Exports&#13;
2/    The load factor for a given period is defined as ratio of average load versus peak load in that period.&#13;

were not considered in the simulations performed3.&#13;
7.     The system load is modeled by four load duration curves4: winter, spring, summer and fall. For&#13;
illustration, Figure 111.4 shows daily load profiles for winter and summer working days and Sundays for&#13;
the period July 1, 1992 - June 30, 1993. Figure III.5 exhibits yearly maximum and minimum monthly&#13;
loads for the same period.&#13;
8.     Firm  Commitments5. The only unit assumed to be firmly committed was a 225 MW  unit at&#13;
Dobrotvorsk, currently under construction, and the nuclear units, as described in para. 10 below.&#13;
9.     Retirement Schedule. The following retirement schedule was provided by Minenergo. (Note:&#13;
lxlOO in 1996 means that 1 unit of 100 MW is retired in year 1996.)&#13;

Net exports of electricity declined dramatically in the last four years, from 27,970 GWh in 1990 (9.4%&#13;
of total generation) to 1146 GWh in 1993 (0.5% of total generation). Demand is falling in most of the&#13;
traditional Ukrainian electricity export markets. Also, most of the UPS now operates in an island mode.&#13;
It is, therefore, difficult to project levels of electricity exports for future years. Given the relatively limited&#13;
objectives of this exercise, exports were not included in the analysis.&#13;
4/     A load duration curve for a given time period represents duration of time for which the system load is&#13;
greater than a given load level.&#13;
5f     The WASP model handles units commnitted to future additions (these units, together with the existing units&#13;
comprise what is in WASP terminology termed as "fixed" system) in a different manner than the candidate&#13;
units, i.e., its investment costs are not part of the objective function being minimized in the optimization&#13;
process, for obvious reasons (since they are committed, they are not part of the WASP's decision&#13;
procedure). The term "candidate units" refers to units that are considered as candidates for system&#13;
expansion.&#13;

10.    Nuclear program.  For the nuclear program, the following scenario has been adopted:&#13;
Zaporozhye 6, Khmelnitsky 2, and Rovno 4 completed in 1995-1999, and Chernobyl 3 recommissioned&#13;
in 1996. It was also assumed that Chernobyl units 1, 2 and 3, with 1000 MW capacity each, would be&#13;
retired in the 1997-2005 period. One thousand MW of nuclear capacity was assumed to be unavailable&#13;
throughout the planning period due to safety upgrades of the nuclear plants.&#13;
11.    Candidate Units. The following units were considered as candidates for the system expansion&#13;
(the first number in parentheses represents construction costs, with interest during construction included,&#13;
in US$ million; the second number represents duration of construction, in years): 120 MW single cycle&#13;
gas turbine (357, 3), 450 MW combined cycle gas turbines (770, 4), 500 MW pulverized coal unit (1500,&#13;
5), and 500 MW mazut steam unit (1135, 4). Also, pump storage units of 324 MW in generating and&#13;
408 MW in pumping regime, with cycle efficiency of 0.7 and yearly generation of 492 GWh, were&#13;
considered in order to model the Dniester pump storage plant (PSP) as a candidate. The remaining&#13;
investment costs for the Dniester PSP, taking into account that about 70% of civil works and 20% of&#13;
equipment was completed, were estimated at 227$/kW (of generating power), i.e., the cost of total&#13;
completion was estimated at US$ 514.8 million (in 1994 US$).&#13;

12.    Fuel Prices. The price of natural gas was assumed to escalate from $55/tcm in 1994 to $80/tcm&#13;
in 2010, in real terms (in 1994 US$) with uniform growth rate over the period. The price of mazut was&#13;
increased from $60/ton in 1994 to $75/ton in 2010, and the price of coal from $15/ton to $20/ton in year&#13;
2000, remaining at that level thereafter. Calorific values of the fuels were assumed at 8.1 Gcal/tcm (gas),&#13;
9.7 Gcal/ton (mazut), and 5 Gcal/ton (coal). The price of nuclear fuel was assumed at $ 5.2 per MWh&#13;
electricity produced.&#13;
13.    Other assumptions.  Given the current low level of maintenance activities and the need to&#13;
improve maintenance, the operating and maintenance costs were assumed to rise from their current levels&#13;

by 10% annually in real terms until 2000, and at 5% thereafter. The discount rate, used both for&#13;
levelizing all costs and for the calculation of interest during construction, was 10%.&#13;
D. Results&#13;
14.    Three cases were evaluated using the medium load forecast, with the four nuclear units firnly&#13;
committed and commissioned according to the schedule described in para. 10. The base case (Case 1)&#13;
assumed completion of seven units at the Dniester PSP in 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2006,&#13;
respectively. In Case 2, the optimal timing of completing the Dniester PSP units was determined by the&#13;
progran, rather than being pre-determined. Case 3, designed to test the contribution of the Dniester PSP,&#13;
assumed that no units at the Dniester PSP would be completed during the planning period.&#13;
15.    Total levelized system costs (for 1993 as the base year) for the medium demand cases (Cases 1,&#13;
2 and 3) are US$ 17,847 million, US$ 17,691 million and US$ 17,751 million, respectively. The&#13;
associated total investment costs for the planning period, in constant 1994 US$ million (i.e., not&#13;
levelized), assuming level 3 safety upgrades for the nuclear units6, were 4093, 4093 and 5311,&#13;
respectively, of which costs of completing the four nuclear units were 1935.7 No new capacity additions&#13;
(in addition to the firmly comnmitted 225 MW thermal capacity and 4000 MW nuclear capacity as&#13;
described above are needed until 2008. The best solution (Case 2) is to commission all 7 units of the&#13;
Dniester PSP; in addition, 6 gas turbine units (5 in 2009, 1 in 2010) and four combined-cycle units (all&#13;
in 2010) are added. If the Dniester PSP is excluded (Case 3), the number of combined cycle units in the&#13;
optimal solution increases to 9, while the number of gas turbine units remains 6. The presence of rather&#13;
inefficient, but less capital intensive gas turbine units in the optimal solution shows that the system needs&#13;
additional peaking capacity.&#13;
16.    Although software constraints8 make the direct evaluation of the proposed project difficult, the&#13;
results of the least-cost analysis suggest that rehabilitation of the existing hydro plants is consistent with&#13;
the need to preserve and enhance regulating capacity. A similar conclusion should hold for the low-cost&#13;
rehabilitation of thermal plants that would increase their load-following capabilities and efficiency. At&#13;
the same time, the presence of the capacity surplus throughout an extended period (until 2008 for the&#13;
medium demand forecast) merits a closer examination of the retirement program. The retirement of&#13;
additional units that are inefficient, expensive to maintain and operate, and would require significant&#13;
investments for rehabilitation, could be a cost effective solution.&#13;
17.    Three additional cases, designed to shed some light on the cost-effectiveness of the assumed&#13;
6/     See footnote 9 below.&#13;
7/     The investment figures do not include the costs of completing the 225 MW Dobrotvorsk unit (para 8), and&#13;
the cost of recomissioning Chernobyl 2.&#13;
8/     The constraints most relevant to this analysis are: (i) the modeling of hydro plants is fairly crude in the&#13;
WASP; (ii) the modeling of a rehabilitation of a plant is not possible within a single run and is, therefore,&#13;
awkward, time-consuming and heuristic; (iii) most of time-dependent constraints and time-dependent&#13;
parameters can not be modeled. These constraints, among other things, may result in the later than optimal&#13;
scheduling of the completion of pump storage units.&#13;

Months&#13;
completion of the nuclear units under construction (Zaporozhye 6, Khmelnitsky 2, and Rovno 4) were&#13;
also simulated, based on the cost figures proposed by the joint US DOE/Ukrainian Working Group&#13;
(Report of June 23, 1994)9. In these cases, the timing of the completion of nuclear units was not fixed,&#13;
i.e., it was left to the software to decide whether it was justified to complete the units, and to determine&#13;
the optimal timing of the completion (other assumptions were the same as for Case 1). The US&#13;
DOE/Ukrainian Working Group Report discussed three cases. In Case 4, which differ in the level of&#13;
safety measures for the three units whose construction is most advanced, Z6 was completed as originally&#13;
designed, and K2 and R4 were completed with level 1 safety measures. The costs of the completion were&#13;
(in US$ per kW) 34, 257 and 267 for Z6, K2 and R4, respectively. In Case 5, Z6 was completed with&#13;
level 1 and 2 safety upgrades, K2 and R4 were completed with level 2 safety upgrades, with&#13;
corresponding costs of 110, 303 and 313 US$/kW. Case 6 assumed level "3" safety upgrades for all&#13;
three units, with corresponding costs of 216, 439 and 449 US$/kW. It was further assumed that the&#13;
Chernobyl 3 unit would not be recommissioned, and the remaining two units would be decommissioned&#13;
in 1996-1999, respectively, in all three cases. The following are the least-cost results indicating optimal&#13;
timing for completing the units:&#13;
Case 4        Case 5         Case 6&#13;

9/     The following completion cost figures were assumed by the US DOE/Ukrainian Working Group: Z6: 34,&#13;
76, 182; K2: 257, 46, 182; R4: 267, 46, 182. The above costs are in million of 1994 US$, the first&#13;
figure includes completion costs and level 1 safety upgrades for K2 and R4, the second figure includes Li&#13;
and L2 safety upgrades for Z6, and L2 safety upgrades for K2 and R4 (Ll upgrades for these two units&#13;
were included in the completion costs); the third figure includes L3 safety upgrades.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

18.   In all three cases it was optimal to complete all units under construction, with commissioning&#13;
years depending on the level of safety upgrades, i.e., on the completion costs. Furthermore, in all three&#13;
cases the least-cost plans contained installing 2 single-cycle gas turbines in 2009 and 3 in 2010, and one&#13;
combined-cycle gas turbine in 2009 and another one in 2010 (in addition to completing the nuclear units,&#13;
as given above).&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;

UKRAINE&#13;
HYDROPOVER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEMS CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
Notes to the Financial Statements and Projections&#13;
1993 and 1994 Statements&#13;
1.           Ukrainian statutory accounting employs a cash system  with elements of accruals&#13;
accounting. Revenue is recorded in the income statement only after payment is received, and only at this&#13;
point are the associated costs recorded. During periods when there is poor performance in collecting&#13;
revenues, the statutory accounts can seriously misstate financial performance, because the costs associated&#13;
with uncollected revenues are held off the books, even when they have been incurred in fact.&#13;
2.           In order to provide a more meaningful presentation of the financial performance of&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo and National Dispatch Center (NDC), their historical financial statements have been&#13;
modified to approximate International Accounting Standards (IAS) using accruals accounting. Revenues&#13;
represent the imputed sales value of energy and services supplied during each year, irrespective of the&#13;
timing of receipt of those revenues. Costs reflect the costs of supplying those services and energy.&#13;
3.           Both Dniprohydroenergo and NDC are experiencing difficulty in collecting customer&#13;
accounts and meeting their own payments to suppliers, so that there is a difference between their accrued&#13;
income and the income they are actually realizing on a timely basis. Under IAS, such delays in collecting&#13;
consumer accounts are not reflected on the income statement until the point when accounts are recognized&#13;
as being uncollectible and written off, or when inflationary losses on the outstanding receivables are&#13;
recognized. Because Ukrainian statutory accounting rules do not recognize either of these concepts (bad&#13;
debt or inflationary losses), there has historically been no recognition of the impact that payment delays&#13;
have upon a company's income. The contracts, covenants, and tariff rules to be agreed during&#13;
negotiation of this project will address these omissions, as discussed below. Projections of income for&#13;
years 1995 and beyond contain new line items ("provision for bad debt," and "interest penalty income")&#13;
that reflect the measures that were agreed during negotiations to address the problem of delayed revenue&#13;
collection. These measures, in effect, will require the companies to begin recognizing bad debt and&#13;
inflationary losses, but the resulting losses to the companies will be compensated through tariff-recovery&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
4.           The companies' problems in collecting accounts, during 1993 and 1994, can be seen in&#13;
the accounts receivable recorded on their balance sheets, and in the changes to accounts receivable&#13;
recorded on their cash-flow statements. The NDC's accounts receivable amounted to 96 days of annual&#13;
revenue during 1993, and fell to 60 days in 1994. This did not reflect an improvement in collection&#13;
performance; rather, it reflected inflation of the revenue stream that serves as a denominator in the ratio.&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo had 36 days of receivables in 1993, rising to 45 days in 1994.&#13;
5.           The fixed assets of both companies were originally recorded on a cost basis. Costs&#13;
recorded during the Soviet era traditionally were below comparable costs in the West. The statutory&#13;
depreciation lives for fixed assets are generally far longer than the useful lives applicable under IAS.&#13;
Ukraine has experienced severe inflation since 1991, and the book values of the companies' fixed assets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

remain seriously undervalued, despite indexations that have occurred under national law in May 1992 and&#13;
August 1993 as well as the most recent revaluation in January 1995. These indices are very broad and&#13;
may not accurately reflect the actual worth of the fixed assets.&#13;
Assumptions for the Financial Projections&#13;
6.            Power Production.  Hydropower production in 1995 and beyond is expected to be&#13;
somewhat below recent historical levels. Local personnel report that power has been produced above&#13;
sustainable levels by drawing down the water reservoirs, and it is assumed that this cannot continue.&#13;
Production of nuclear and thermal power and import/export levels are detailed in the table which follows,&#13;
entitled "National Dispatch Center: Assumptions for Electricity Purchases," which follows from Annexes&#13;
1 and 3. Cost and tariff assumptions have been discussed in Section C of Chapter III of the main text.&#13;
7.            General Financial Assumptions. Assumptions for Ukrainian inflation and US$/Krb&#13;
exchange rates are as outlined in Section C of Chapter III of the main text. The US dollar inflation rate&#13;
has been assumed at 2.2%.&#13;
8.            Tariffs for hydropower are set at a level that covers the costs of existing facilities,&#13;
including depreciation and allowed profit margin. In addition, the tariff cost-recovery mechanism&#13;
described in Section C of Chapter III of the main text (see also Annex 7, paras. 7 - 9) is included at a&#13;
level sufficient to cover costs associated with the World Bank project and to generate additional US$ 8&#13;
million equivalent per year of funds for other rehabilitation and investment projects that are expected to&#13;
be necessary after the year 2000.&#13;
9.            The resale tariff of the National Dispatch Center is set at a level that permits it to recover&#13;
its costs of purchased power from all sources, plus an uplift to cover its small costs of operation,&#13;
including a profit margin. The actual resale mechanism, which will involve allocation of a portion of&#13;
its low cost supplies to the Local Electricity Companies who are its customers, and sale of thermal power&#13;
at a wholesale rate reflective of marginal costs, is discussed in paras. 3.4 - 3.5 of the main text.&#13;
10.           Both companies were subject to a 22% profits tax prior to 1995 which was based on&#13;
revenues minus material costs (operating costs net of costs associated with labor). Ukraine's previous&#13;
tax law did not recognize interest on long-term debt or labor costs as deductible items. At the beginning&#13;
of 1995, Ukraine introduced a new corporate profit tax of 30% which allows for the deduction of labor&#13;
costs before tax. At the time of publication, it was still unclear whether interest on long-term debt would&#13;
also be deductible, although it is highly likely that this provision will also be approved. For the purposes&#13;
of the financial projections, the new tax law and rate are applied beginning in 1995 assuming that interest&#13;
on long-term debt can be expensed.&#13;
11.           The hydropower stations pay a 0.8 % - 1.2% road maintenance charge, on the same tax&#13;
base that is used for the profits tax. Proceeds go to a local government entity or are retained by the&#13;
hydropower station, depending on where the plant is located and the division of responsibility for road&#13;
maintenance. Contributions to the Chernobyl fund are paid by both organizations, under national law,&#13;
and are treated here as a labor-related cost in operating expenses. Similar treatment is accorded to&#13;
payments to the unemployment fund, assessed at 1 % of the profits tax base, and statutory worker benefits&#13;
such as the insurance fund.&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 3&#13;
12.          Company-Specific Assumptions. The projected balance sheets take into account the&#13;
indexation announced as of January 1995 according to an approximation of the age of assets. The actual&#13;
indexation will inevitably be slightly different because it is impossible to guess the exact acquisition date&#13;
of the assets. A more thorough revaluation, aimed at determining the proper value of existing assets, has&#13;
not been performed in the context of this analysis. Thus, the assets to be added under the World Bank&#13;
loan, because they will be properly valued when booked, appear on the balance sheets to make up a&#13;
disproportionate share of the total fixed assets of the two companies.&#13;
13.          For the companies' statutory accounting and reporting requirements, the new assets&#13;
created under this project will be treated according to the usual rules prescribed by Ukrainian law. Such&#13;
rules involve useful lives that are in some cases much longer than would be called for under IAS. For&#13;
this reason, an attempt has been made to apply IAS standard useful lives and depreciation methods in&#13;
developing the income projections included in this Annex.&#13;
14.          Both companies make a number of statutory fund contributions, which are tied to their&#13;
profitability after tax. These are currently paid to Minenergo, which uses them as retained earnings to&#13;
be distributed among the organizations within its structure. It is assumed that, after the restructuring of&#13;
the power industry, such fund contributions would cease and the resulting funds would remain at the&#13;
disposal of the corporatized Dniprohydroenergo and NDC/Energomarket. Such funds are thus treated&#13;
as part of equity on the balance sheets of the companies.&#13;
15.          Standard ratios such as the current ratio and quick ratio appear highly distorted,&#13;
particularly for Dniprohydroenergo, during some of the forecast years. This is simply an artifact of the&#13;
tariff cost-recovery mechanism that is being adopted to ensure recovery of project-related costs. This&#13;
mechanism will cause large capital costs of the project to be passed through tariffs on a current basis, as&#13;
cash is spent on local investment costs and on the subsequent repayment of the World Bank loan. The&#13;
tariff cost-recovery mechanism increases billed tariffs, and hence increases the companies' accounts&#13;
receivable. At the same time, the associated project costs, being capital in nature, are not reflected in&#13;
the companies' routine, course-of-business accounts payable.   This is particularly true for&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo, which is very capital-intensive but has very low current liabilities. For this reason,&#13;
standard ratios (such as current assets over current liabilities) achieve very high values during the peak&#13;
years of tariff cost-recovery. Under the circumstances, such ratios have limited information value.&#13;
16.          The projections embody the tariff, contract, and covenant provisions that were agreed&#13;
during loan negotiations. Specifically, resale tariffs for the NDC include an allowance for bad debt as&#13;
described in Section C of Chapter III. Such an allowance is not included for the Dniprohydroenergo,&#13;
because it is assumed that NDC (its only customer) will settle its accounts in full within 20 days of&#13;
billing, as will be required in the contract between NDC and Dniprohydroenergo. Both companies will&#13;
be entitled to collect interest penalties on outstanding receivables not paid within 20 days. It is assumed&#13;
that Dniprohydroenergo will be paid promptly and hence no interest-penalty income is shown on its&#13;
statements. However, it is assumed that NDC will have income from interest penalties during the project&#13;
period, because the average age of its receivables will be reduced to 60 days in 1995, 40 days in 1996,&#13;
35 days in 1997, and 30 days thereafter (para. 3.16). This interest-penalty income has been calculated&#13;
based on the average number of days receivables during each of the years; the penalty would apply after&#13;
the 20th day, and would accrue at a rate calculated to compensate NDC for its implicit loss from&#13;
extending trade credit and provide an incentive for prompt payment.&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 1&#13;
UKRAINE&#13;
HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
Financial Rate of Return Calculation for&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo&#13;
1.            Revenues.  The project will produce incremental revenue through two mechanisms.&#13;
First, it will result in incremental output (i.e., positive difference between the electricity output under the&#13;
"with" and "without the project" scenarios). Second, the tariff structure to be adopted in connection with&#13;
the project will result in an incremental cost-recovery mechanism that will be charged on all output (pre-&#13;
existing and incremental output associated with the project), beginning in 1995. In standard regulatory&#13;
practice, this conforms to "rolled-in" rate treatment, whereunder all ratepayers bear a ratable share of&#13;
the cost of making improvements to their system. Such treatment is appropriate in instances, such as this,&#13;
where benefits of the project (e.g., enhanced reliability, prevention of losses in capacity over time) accrue&#13;
to all parties who currently consume hydropower.&#13;
2.            Taxation. It is assumed that revenues associated with the cost-recovery mechanism will&#13;
be subjected to the same taxation regime as other revenues of Dniprohydroenergo. This includes a 30%&#13;
"'profits" tax, a 1 % road-maintenance assessment, and a 1 % unemployment fund contribution, all of&#13;
which operate off the same tax base. The base for such taxes and assessments is revenue minus "material&#13;
costs." These material costs include operating costs with the exception of labor costs. During the years&#13;
of construction when the tariff cost-recovery mechanism will be generating funds to pay for local&#13;
construction costs, the new facilities will not result in any addition to Dniprohydroenergo's operating&#13;
costs, and incremental revenues are not offset by an incremental deduction. Thus, it is assumed that&#13;
100% of the incremental revenue stream will be subjected to these three taxes, totalling 32%.&#13;
3.            As discussed in Annex 6, Ukraine's tax law is subject to change, including the possible&#13;
introduction of a deduction for interest on long-term debt. The rate of return is not sensitive to this&#13;
uncertainty, since it is assumed that any resulting reductions in tax would be flowed through to consumers&#13;
via reductions in the tariff.&#13;
4.            Operating Costs. The operating cost reduction is the same that is assumed for purposes&#13;
of calculating the economic rate of return, however, it has been converted to current dollars assuming&#13;
a US dollar inflation rate of 2.2%.&#13;
5.            Project Costs. The project costs are in current dollars and reflect the local and foreign&#13;
investment costs and the commitment fee on a "cash-flow" basis as spent.&#13;
6.            Rate of Return and Sensitivities. The financial internal rate of return is 13.5% on a&#13;
real basis, and 16.0% on a current basis. This compares favorably to Dniprohydroenergo's estimated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 2&#13;
cost of capital, 8.5%, reflecting the estimated cost of borrowing under this project' (1.5% on-lending&#13;
interest rate, plus 7.0% estimated World Bank rate). It is assumed that any reductions in project costs,&#13;
or reasonable cost increases within the allowed contingencies, would be flowed through to consumers via&#13;
a reduction/increase in the tariff. For this reason, the rate of return is not sensitive to changes in project&#13;
costs. It is sensitive to the extent to which the forecast operating cost reductions and incremental&#13;
electricity output are achieved. Risks associated with those factors have been discussed in the section on&#13;
economic rate of return.&#13;
7.             Because of Ukraine's high inflation rate and due to volatility in the Karbovanets/hard&#13;
currency exchange rates, the beneficiaries would be at risk unless their tariff formulas provide a close&#13;
match between actual cash outlays under the project, and the recovery of such costs. The cost-recovery&#13;
mechanism has been designed to minimize this risk, thus reducing the sensitivity of the financial rate of&#13;
return to inflation and exchange-rate movements. An alternative, more standard, recovery mechanism&#13;
would have been recovery of investment costs through customary depreciation of the new assets.&#13;
Customary depreciation typically results in over-recovery of investment outlays in early years, and under-&#13;
recovery in later years. The beneficiaries would be required to invest over-recovered funds in a way that&#13;
keeps pace with inflation and exchange-rate movements, for use in years when there is an under-recovery,&#13;
placing them at considerable risk. Because of these risks, a more direct tariff cost-recovery mechanism&#13;
will be used in place of customary depreciation. The cost recovery mechanism will fully recover local&#13;
investment costs and the small commitment fee on an annual basis as spent, during the years 1995-2000.&#13;
Obligations for the commitment fee would be converted to Krb at the then-applicable exchange rate.&#13;
Interest on the loan incurred during construction will be capitalized and included in the loan balance;&#13;
therefore, tariff recovery of accrued interest costs during these years will be deferred until such time as&#13;
loan repayment commences. At the end of the 5-year grace period, loan repayment will commence and&#13;
continue for 12 years. At that time, amounts equal to the beneficiaries' actual loan-service obligations&#13;
will be recovered through prices, with conversion to hard currency at the then-applicable exchange rates.&#13;
8..            During the early years of loan repayment, the cost-recovery mechanism will result in&#13;
slightly lower prices than would be the case if customary asset depreciation had been used. In later years,&#13;
there will be correspondingly higher recovery of investment principal through rates. Thus, the cost-&#13;
recovery mechanism tends to defer revenue, and hence reduces the financial rate of return somewhat.&#13;
However, as noted above, it significantly reduces the risk surrounding the estimated rate of return.&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo has no other long-term debt upon which to base its average cost of borrowing, and its&#13;
cost of equity is unclear as its assets remain under state ownership.&#13;

for the project as whole. Project total indicators of economic benefits also reflect the investment costs&#13;
associated with the dam safety monitoring and technical assistance components, for which no benefits&#13;
were quantified. All figures are expressed in constant 1994 U.S. dollars. A summary discussion of&#13;
the methodology of the economic analysis and main findings are provided in Chapter III.E. This Annex&#13;
outlines the basic assumptions used and presents the detailed results for the project as a whole and its&#13;
main components, including plant-by-plant results for the hydropower rehabilitation component (Tables&#13;
1-10).&#13;
Basic Assumptions&#13;
A. Hydropower Rehabilitation&#13;
2.           Electricity Prices. The average economic price of electricity is forecast to increase from&#13;
the equivalent of UScent 2/kWh in 1995 to UScent 3/kWh in 2005 and remain at that level thereafter.&#13;
The economic price approximates the estimated long-run marginal cost. The average economic price was&#13;
used for the valuation of off-peak sales (one-fifth of the total). For the balance of sales, the peak&#13;
economic price was used, which is 35% higher than the average price.&#13;
3.           Availability.  Under the "without" rehabilitation scenario, it is assumed that  (i)&#13;
electricity production falls by 0.5% per year due to reduced availability caused by growing plant&#13;
deterioration; and (ii) a lower percentage (79% instead of 80%) of electricity can be sold at peak time&#13;
due to the reduced availability of the generating units. Under the "with" project case, (i) electricity&#13;
output declines at a rate of 0. 1% after completion of the rehabilitation; and (ii) 80% of the energy is sold&#13;
at the peak price to reflect higher availability.&#13;
4.           Efficiency Increase.  Based on actual equipment testing, the rehabilitated units, in&#13;
addition to regaining original name-plate efficiency, are expected to achieve on average an incremental&#13;
efficiency gain of about 4% (expressed as increased energy production per year) due to the more modem&#13;
design of new equipment (turbines, generators, transformers) and materials. Over half of the full-load&#13;
efficiency increase results from the more efficient turbines. The efficiency increase is reflected in the&#13;
analysis beginning in the third year of the implementation period, with the full efficiency benefit realized&#13;
one year after the completion of the investment.&#13;
5.           Operation and Maintenance. For 1994, real values for the O&amp;M costs were obtained&#13;
from local sources and converted to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of 50,000 Krb per US$. To reflect&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 2&#13;
the current undervaluation in U.S. dollar terms of labor, materials and other items, O&amp;M costs were&#13;
assumed to rise by 10% per year from 1995 to 2000, and by 5% per year thereafter under both the&#13;
"with" and "without" project cases. The rehabilitation is expected to generate savings in O&amp;M costs&#13;
relative to the "without" project situation. To reflect this, O&amp;M costs increase at a lower rate under the&#13;
rehabilitation scenario, following the slope of an empirically determined curve that relates the rate of&#13;
change in O&amp;M costs to the age of the plants.  Rehabilitation is essentially taken as the equivalent of&#13;
a "reduction" in the assumed age of the plant, with the reduction depending on the scope of the&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
B. System Control Rehabilitation&#13;
6             The main benefits associated with this component were quantified in terms of fuels saved&#13;
as a result of improved (lower cost) allocation of total generation requirement among the generating&#13;
units and improved power flow in the system. The achievable fuel savings were conservatively assumed&#13;
at 2.5% of the annual fuel requirements (1.25% from 1997 to 1999 to reflect partial implementation).&#13;
The underlying generation forecast for the period 1995-2020 was based on the electricity demand&#13;
projection presented in Annex 1. As a result of the upgrade of communications, dispatch and system&#13;
control under the proposed project, about one-third of the thermal capacity would become available for&#13;
automatic economic dispatch. Fuel savings were valued at the projected economic price of heavy fuel&#13;
oil, natural gas and coal (see Annex 3 for the fuel price forecast).&#13;
7.           Investment Costs.  For each project component, investment costs used in the economic&#13;
analysis are based on detailed cost estimates in Annex 5. They include a 15 % physical contingency&#13;
allowance for all components. Because of the current undervaluation in U.S. dollars of locally procured&#13;
investment items, local investment costs also include 50% of the price contingency to reflect anticipated&#13;
relative increases in unit prices of such inputs.&#13;

Performance Indicators&#13;
1.    The following indicators will be used to measure the effectiveness of project implementation&#13;
and operation:&#13;
A. Technical Indicators&#13;
For hydropower plants:&#13;
(i)    Nominal and maximum operating capacity (MW) for each unit. The following are&#13;
estimates of the nominal capacities (in MW) of the individual generating units in the&#13;
plants after rehabilitation:&#13;
Kiev:               19.9&#13;
Kremenchug:         56.6&#13;
Dniproderzhinsk:    52.2&#13;
Dnieper I:          79.8&#13;
Kakhovka:           52.2&#13;
It is expected that total increase in system capacity after the rehabilitation will be 130&#13;
MW;&#13;
(ii)   Total energy produced and energy sales (GWh/year). Total energy sales are expected&#13;
to reach an average of 10,800 GWh/year over the next five years after rehabilitation&#13;
(assuming normal water inflows, i.e., equal to the historical average);&#13;
(iii)   Total inflows into reservoir, total water turbined, total water spilled (thousand cubic&#13;
meters/year);&#13;
(iv)   Target turbine efficiency, for each unit (%), to be achieved after rehabilitation&#13;
Kiev:               4.3 %&#13;
Kremenchug:         3.4 %&#13;
Dniproderzhinsk:    4.2 %&#13;
Dnieper I:          3.5 %&#13;
Kakhovka:           3.9 %&#13;
For National Dispatch Center:&#13;
(v)    Compared to 1994/95, reduction in ihe deviation of maximunm and minimum&#13;
frequency from the 50 liz target, and reduction of the monthly maximum accumulated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

time error (sec);&#13;
(vi)   Compared to 1994/95, reduction in the number, amount (MW) and duration of load&#13;
curtailments per year;&#13;
(vii)   Real time economic dispatch software installed, tested, and operating by June 30,&#13;
1999.&#13;
B. Financial Indicators&#13;
(viii)  NDC's account receivables should not exceed 60 days in 1995, 40 days in 1996, 35&#13;
days in 1997, and 30 days thereafter;&#13;
(ix)   Maintaining the required debt service ratio (1.5) and self financing ratio (40%) by&#13;
Dniprohydroenergo and NDC during the project period.&#13;
C. Proiect Implementation&#13;
(x)    Actual timing of procurement actions by bid package (bid specifications, invitation for&#13;
bidding, opening of bids, evaluation reports, award of contract, contract signing)&#13;
against the schedule;&#13;
(xi)   Actual installation of equipment against the project schedule;&#13;
(xii)   Actual disbursements against the disbursement schedule.&#13;

HYDROPOWER REHABILITATION AND SYSTEM CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
1.    The supervision is expected to require about 25 staff weeks per fiscal year during the first two&#13;
years of implementation, and 15 staff weeks per year thereafter. The schedule below is in addition to&#13;
the regular review requirements for procurement actions, progress reports and correspondence,&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Hydropower
            Rehabilitation and System Control Project are to: a) improve
            the efficiency, reliability, safety and environmental
            performance of hydropower plants; b) increase hydropower
            generation capacity; c) improve the quality of electricity
            supply by upgrading load and frequency control; and d)
            reduce fuel costs by facilitating the economic dispatch of
            generating units. The project includes the following
            components: 1) implementation of the complete rehabilitation
            program for the Dnieper I and II hydropower plants and the
            Kiev pump storage plant (PSP); near-complete implementation
            of the rehabilitation program for the Kakhovka hydropower
            station (HPS); and partial implementation of the
            rehabilitation program for the Kiev, Kanev, Kremenchug and
            Dniprodzerzhinsk hydropower plants; 2) installation of dam
            safety monitoring systems at the main water reservoirs on
            the Dnieper river; 3) upgrade of communications, dispatch,
            system control and protection, and generating unit control;
            and 4) technical assistance for project implementation, and
            optimization of the use of the reservoirs on the Dnieper river.
