HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND FAMILY PLANNING IN INDIA:&#13;
A Survey of Experiments and Special Projects&#13;
The paper surveys fourteen experiments and speciaLl projects in health, nutri-&#13;
tion, and family planning in India. They fall into three broad categories--&#13;
research projects, pilot projects, and service projects. The paper reviews&#13;
services, workers, and population coverage to distill the lessons for some&#13;
basic questions.&#13;
o    Does integration make a difference in the cost-effectiveness of ser-&#13;
vices for health, nutrition, and family planning?&#13;
o    What is needed for community participation, and what are its&#13;
benefits?&#13;
o    What work can paraprofessionals do?&#13;
o    Are effective supervision and training systems essential for the&#13;
success of projects?&#13;
o    Do outreach and the targeting of services yield substantial benefits?&#13;
o    How does the cost of services offered by special projects compare&#13;
with that of government services?&#13;
O    What is the best way to monitor the effect of services?&#13;
The answers that this survey provides are summarized in the opening section.&#13;

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW&#13;
The World Bank has been collaborating with Johns Hopkins University in&#13;
analyzing data collected from a field experiment on various combinations of&#13;
health, nutrition, and family planning provided f-rom 1969 to 1974 in Narangwal&#13;
(Punjab), India. The purpose of this paper is to place the Narangwal experi-&#13;
ence in the perspective of other special projects and experiments in India.&#13;
We obtained information on many of those projects and experiments by writing&#13;
to their sponsors in India. We also obtained information from the materials&#13;
presented at the Primary Health Care Conference that the Indian Council of&#13;
Medical Research (ICMR) organized in New Delhi in April 1980. Even so, a&#13;
systematic evaluation and comparison of special projects and experiments in&#13;
India is hampered by the lack of complete data. Only one or two projects had&#13;
rigorous monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Guided by three factors, we selected fourteen projects for review.&#13;
First, we included the projects that have attracted the most attention, as&#13;
evident from the proceedings of ICMR Conference in 1980. Second, we consid-&#13;
ered the availability of data from published reports, documents, and articles&#13;
and from correspondence with managers or sponsors of the projects in India.&#13;
Third, we focused on recent projects and therefore excluded old experiments&#13;
(Khanna, for example), even though they were we]Ll documented.&#13;
There are many gaps in knowledge about these projects and about the&#13;
potential contribution of project services, particularly that of primary&#13;
health care. The service packages adopted the contributions of various&#13;
factors to project accomplishments, and the final effects of different&#13;
interventions still are not fully understood. The potential for replicating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
services on a large scale also needs to be assessed with a focus on cost,&#13;
institutional requirements, and problems of implementation.&#13;
It generally is believed that small projects do better than the large&#13;
projects both in the public sector and in the private sector (for example, see&#13;
Pyle 1979). Although this review finds some validity in this point of view,&#13;
the advantages of the small projects need to be weighed against a few qualifi-&#13;
cations, which this review brings out. First, there is comparatively less&#13;
information on smaller projects--because of the inadequacy of their systems&#13;
for collecting data and for monitoring and evaluating progress. That&#13;
precludes systematic analysis of what projects have achieved and what inter-&#13;
ventions have meant for the population covered by services.&#13;
Second, the coverage by small projects has been insignificant in&#13;
relation to the population to be eventually served. In relation to their&#13;
coverage, however, these projects get undue attention. For example, all the&#13;
special projects in Maharashta cover only about 400,000 people, or less than&#13;
0.8 percent of the state's population. Third, most of these projects are the&#13;
results of the initiative and drive of individuals. In addition to this&#13;
intangible factor, the costs of replicating small experiments and special&#13;
projects on a national scale are high.&#13;
Despite these qualifications about the small experiments and special&#13;
projects, several lessons learned from them have general applicability.&#13;
The integration of services for health, nutrition, and family&#13;
planning is more cost-effective than delivering separate services, whether&#13;
projects are multipurpose or single-purpose. According to the well-documented&#13;
results of the Narangwal research, the effects of integrated services on&#13;
growth, morbidity, mortality, and family planning acceptance are all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vi -&#13;
significant. The Mandwa project combined prenatal and postnatal care with&#13;
nutrition and immunization programs to achieve better birth weights, avoid&#13;
neonatal tetanus, and reduce infant mortality. In the Jamkhed project, women&#13;
who had just delivered and who had three to four children were encouraged to&#13;
adopt family planning while the children in the family received continued care&#13;
and follow-up. The acceptance rate among these women was very high. In the&#13;
Kasa project, groups at risk were identified through regular surveillance&#13;
visits, which then helped in designing various health and nutrition&#13;
services. Even the experiences of the single interventions underline the need&#13;
for integration. For example, the Special Nutrition Program--launched by the&#13;
government in 1971 with the main objective of providing supplemnetary&#13;
nutrition for preschool children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers--had&#13;
problems. Concerns have been expressed about whether the feeding-only&#13;
strategy of the project adequately addresses the health and nutritional needs&#13;
of the target groups.&#13;
Community participation, where stressed, leads to better handling of&#13;
community health and welfare problems, better acceptance of health care&#13;
services, and generally more equitable distribution of the benefits of&#13;
services. But the experiences of the projects reviewed show that community&#13;
participation did not lead to success in all cases. If the basis of par-&#13;
ticipation did not go beyond the established power structure in the villages&#13;
(for example, beyond the gram panchayats), the success was limited. At&#13;
Mandwa, local health committees of village leaders were formed. Those leaders&#13;
used their involvement to further their position in the village hierarchy,&#13;
something that enhanced rather than decreased inequalities. At Jamkhed and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vii -&#13;
Narangwal, community participation went beyond established village commit-&#13;
tees: the Jamkhed project enlisted local community groups, such as Young&#13;
Farmers Club; at Narangwal, efforts were made, before and after the projects&#13;
were launched, to inform communities and to encourage their participation. In&#13;
these projects community participation proved extremely useful.&#13;
The success of community participation depends not only on who in the&#13;
community is involved but on when the communities are involved. Results were&#13;
better if the communities were involved in planning (such as in the Applied&#13;
Nutrition Program at Kerala). The experience of the Indo-Dutch project&#13;
reinforces this point. The approach in that project was to provide clinics,&#13;
health care, and nutritional supplements without any community input. Four&#13;
years after the start of the project, project organizers asked the local&#13;
communities to contribute toward health care services and to pay membership&#13;
fees for women's groups and child care services. The response was sluggish.&#13;
In fact, because of this experience, the leaders of the expanded project in&#13;
Hyderabad approached the community before providing services.&#13;
In most projects, paraprofessional staff deliver preventive and&#13;
simple curative services and do promotional work in the villages. Most of the&#13;
successful projects worked on the primary-health-care principle that village&#13;
health workers, indigenous to the area, should provide health, nutrition and&#13;
related services at the periphery of the health system. In the Narangwal&#13;
project, for example, family health workers treated simple conditions and&#13;
provided health care and follow-up to children receiving services. The Kasa,&#13;
Miraj, and Jamkhed projects used the skills of traditional midwives and&#13;
practitioners; the Indo-Dutch and Mandwa projects recruited new cadres of&#13;
workers and trained and assigned them to villages they came from.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- viii -&#13;
Female staff were generally preferred, primarily because many&#13;
services are more acceptable if delivered by a woman. There is no clear&#13;
picture about the preferred background in education, and experience of workers&#13;
recruited in the project. But even illiterate workers performed well with&#13;
training.&#13;
The more successful projects seem to develop an effective supervisory&#13;
and training system. Generally, the smaller the project, the better the&#13;
supervision and the more impressive the results. For example, in the&#13;
Narangwal population project, family health workers offered various services&#13;
to groups of villages, and the project's impact on contraceptive use was&#13;
measured longitudinally. At Jamkhed and Kasa, workers could be involved in&#13;
planning and implementation--for example, in setting priorities, identifying&#13;
community problems, and delivering services to groups at risk. This produced&#13;
encouraging results.&#13;
Emphasis on outreach generally leads to better use and better&#13;
coverage for the population at risk. The Narangwal experience shows that the&#13;
greater the reliance on home visits, the greater the use of services by low-&#13;
income groups. But one important lesson of these projects is that it is dif-&#13;
ficult to adhere to a selection criterion fixed at the outset of a project.&#13;
Nutrition and health criteria, even age criteria, cannot be strictly&#13;
followed. A certain amount of flexibility is needed but this often leads to&#13;
much less coverage of the target group than desired. And the the total&#13;
absence of a selection criterion can lead to a serious problem (as in the&#13;
Applied Nutrition Program):  the failure to reach low-income families, the&#13;
neediest members of the community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ix -&#13;
In general, the per capita expenditure is fairly low in smaller&#13;
projects that combine health, nutrition, and population, but it still is&#13;
higher than that by government. The range in the projects surveyed was&#13;
between $0.47 and $2.73 per capita (Rs 3.70 and Rs 21.30). At Narangwal the&#13;
annual cost per capita for nutrition services was between $0.80 and $2.00, for&#13;
population services between $1.16 and $2.84. These costs are nearly four&#13;
times higher than the cost of government services. At Poshak the annual costs&#13;
per child were also higher than those of other government nutrition pro-&#13;
grams. In general, nutrition projects cost more per capita than health and&#13;
family planning projects. In some, especially those with strong community&#13;
participation, part of the cost could be recovered.&#13;
Measurement in these projects is complicated, however, by the problem&#13;
of valuing financial and social costs. Many of the projects used highly&#13;
skilled personnel to collect data, undertake various service functions, and&#13;
manage the project's activities. Moreover, the cost of goods and services on&#13;
local markets in India does not reflect their real costs because of distor-&#13;
tions in the economy. So it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which&#13;
projects could assign costs to services in a way that reflects the social&#13;
opportunity cost of labor.&#13;
Measuring benefits is much more difficult than measuring costs&#13;
because the output (the immediate result) and outcome (the final result)&#13;
cannot always be clearly defined. Even when outcome measures can be defined,&#13;
they cannot always be clearly ascribed to the use of services. Thus cost-&#13;
benefit analysis was inappropriate for evaluating these projects.&#13;
Few of the studies collected comprehensive data for outcomes, but&#13;
many did for outputs. These data relate to coverage of the target populations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
x&#13;
and the use of services. But even for projects with formal controls, it is&#13;
difficult to demonstrate that project inputs were responsible for changes in&#13;
growth, morbidity, or infant and child mortality. The output data for many of&#13;
the better-documented projects show, in general, that a comprehensive program&#13;
of integrated services for heatlh, nutrition, and family planning appears to&#13;
be more cost-effective than many of the large single interventions.&#13;
Most projects use output variables (such as service coverage) to&#13;
monitor coverage, but none of the projects surveyed developed an effective&#13;
system of measuring the impact of services. Only a few even attempted to&#13;
measure impact. Retrospective surveys and before-and-after surveys were taken&#13;
to measure changes in outcomes (health, nutrition, or family planning). But&#13;
these changes could not be attributed to services with any degree of confi-&#13;
dence without control groups. Even for projects with control groups, it is&#13;
difficult to attribute changes in outcomes to services.&#13;
In sum, a few guidelines for future Bank projects in population, health, and&#13;
nutrition can be highlighted on the basis of this survey:&#13;
o    First, the integration of health, nutrition, and family planning&#13;
services is desirable, as far as possible, in project design.&#13;
o    Second, community participation, if it is properly designed and if it&#13;
begins at the planning stage, can be very helpful.&#13;
o    Third, paraprofessional staff, with little or no experience and&#13;
education but with an appropriate supervisory and training system,&#13;
can effectively deliver services.&#13;
o    Fourth, a rigid selection criterion for targeting services is not&#13;
possible, but the lack of a selection criterion distracts the project&#13;
from its goals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xi -&#13;
o    Fifth, although the lessons of the projects are relevant, none of&#13;
them can be exactly replicated.&#13;
o    Sixth, cost-benefit analysis is impossible because of the difficulty&#13;
of measuring benefits. Cost-effectiveness analysis, is possible,&#13;
however, and it appears to be a useful tool.&#13;
o    Seventh, a simple system for monitoring progress is desirable for all&#13;
projects. But only well-designed field experiments with heavy&#13;
research components should be used to develop guidelines for&#13;
analyzing impact of services.&#13;

HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND FAMILY PLANNING&#13;
A Survey of Experiments and Special Projects In India&#13;
In August 1980 the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Indian&#13;
Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) published Health for All: An&#13;
Alternative Strategy. That document started a nationwide debate on health--&#13;
including nutrition and family plannring--by highliLghting the limitations of&#13;
health policies and programs. It recommended that three programs should be&#13;
vigorously pursued during the next two decades to reach the goal of health for&#13;
all:&#13;
o    Integrated community development, including family planning.&#13;
o    Improvements in nutrition, health education, and the&#13;
environment.&#13;
o    Adequate health care services for a]Ll through an alternative&#13;
health care system.&#13;
An alternative system, also outlined in the document, stresses primary health&#13;
care, preventive services (including surveillance), maternal and child health&#13;
(MCH) services, and the use of community health volunteers. Implicit in this&#13;
are four principles: first, integrating health, nutrition education, and&#13;
family planning services; second, encouraging community participation in the&#13;
planning and delivery of health care services; third, establishing a pyramidal&#13;
system of health care, with referrals to the upper layers; and fourth, using&#13;
indigenous resources and health personnel. These principles are not new, and&#13;
their usefulness has been demonstrated in many settings. Nonetheless,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
evaluating the Indian experience in implementing these principles not only can&#13;
further demonstrate their usefulness; it can provide some information about&#13;
implementation. That is the objective of this survey.&#13;
THE SETTING&#13;
At independence in 1947, the government system of health care hardly reached&#13;
the rural areas, which were served by health facilities administered by local&#13;
councils and foreign missionaries.  Since then, a vast network of health&#13;
services has been built, often incorporating and strengthening nongovernment&#13;
agencies. In 1952 primary health centers were established as part of the&#13;
national program of community development, and a system of comprehensive&#13;
health care was introduced. Also in 1952 the official Indian family planning&#13;
program got under way, first as a family planning program, later as a family&#13;
welfare program.&#13;
Today the organization of medical care comprises primary health&#13;
centers and subcenters, rural district hospitals, and the large teaching in-&#13;
stitutions and specialty hospitals in cities (table 1).  The health system&#13;
pyramid, with primary health centers and subcenters at the base, gives health&#13;
workers the opportunity to refer patients to higher levels. A primary health&#13;
center provides care to 80,000 to 120,000 people; a subcenter, to 10,000. In&#13;
1978 India had 5,407 primary health centers and 37,690 subcenters. These&#13;
facilities provide many services, including nutrition, sanitation, family&#13;
planning, health education, maternal and child health, the control of communi-&#13;
cable diseases, and the collection of epidemiological and other relevant data.&#13;
Along with pyramidal health care, vertical health programs were&#13;
launched regionally and nationally: campaigns against malaria, tuberculosis,&#13;

and smallpox among them. Staff were recruited and sent to do special work&#13;
with the staff of primary health centers. This arrangement led to operational&#13;
and administrative difficulties. Cadres of specialized or unipurpose workers&#13;
pursued the targets set for their programs, but they neglected basic health&#13;
services. In the family planning program, aggressive measures to persuade&#13;
Indians to adopt permanent contraceptive methods were strongly resented--and&#13;
the bad feelings about family planning affected the performance of health&#13;
workers. The result was that special programs slowed the development of basic&#13;
health care.&#13;
The organization and composition of health teams changed in the late&#13;
1970s. First, a multisectoral approach has increasingly been recognized as&#13;
needed to solve the problems of the community, and the coordination of various&#13;
sectoral activities--such as agriculture, education, housing, and health--has&#13;
been encouraged. Second, unipurpose workers have been converted to multipur-&#13;
pose workers, and vertical health programs have been integrated with basic&#13;
health care.   Third, community participation has been encouraged through the&#13;
recruitment of village and community health workers, chosen by the village&#13;
people and in some instances paid by them.&#13;
According to the revised national health policy, one community health&#13;
worker provides basic medical services in each village. More complicated&#13;
cases are referred to the primary health center or subcenter.  Services are&#13;
integrated, and the package includes health, nutrition, and family planning.&#13;
The revised policy also includes provision for directing services to groups at&#13;
risk in the community: target populations served by special programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Despite such changes in the organization and composition of health&#13;
teams, access to health and related services leaves much to be desired. More&#13;
than 85 percent of the population does not have easy access to health services&#13;
(Antia 1980). Although there now are many more hospitals and medical profes-&#13;
sionals, preventive and promotive health services have not been sufficiently&#13;
developed to reach the large rural population. The infant mortality rate is&#13;
estimated at 110 per 1,000 live births.  Of all deaths 30 percent are during&#13;
the first year of life, 14.6 percent in the next three. Protein and calorie&#13;
malnutrition are big health problems, as are infectious and parasitic&#13;
diseases. Malaria and tuberculosis still are major health hazards.&#13;
The ICMR-ICSSR document, in reviewing health problems in India, had&#13;
this to say about the health care system: "its benefits do not reach the poor&#13;
or the bulk of the rural people. As it is devoid of a participatory element,&#13;
it has actually increased the dependency of the people. Its costs are exhor-&#13;
bitant; and on this basis, the country will not: be able to provide good health&#13;
care to all its citizens" (1980, p. 5).&#13;
FRAMEWORK OF THE SURVEY&#13;
Many experiments, special programs, and research projects have attempted to&#13;
identify problems and determine ways of achieviLng better health, particularly&#13;
in the rural areas. Some of these efforts are designed to test the appropri-&#13;
ateness and effect of a package of services that is acceptable to the&#13;
people. Others are designed to test one component among many services.&#13;
Outcome data are needed to evaluate a strategy systematically and to compare&#13;
it with others; but these data are not availabLe for most of the special&#13;

projects. Even so, the projects can be assessed to see what lessons they&#13;
offer for future directions in health, nutrition, and family planning.&#13;
We have chosen fourteen from a large number of field experiments and&#13;
special projects completed or under way in primary health care, nutrition, and&#13;
family planning. Many of the projects provide health, nutrition, and family&#13;
planning services. Several are concerned primarily with infant, child, and&#13;
maternal care and with morbidity, mortality, and growth. Some are nutrition&#13;
or population projects linked to the primary health care system. Few had&#13;
rigorous monitoring and evaluation. Our selection was guided by published&#13;
documents, reports, and articles about the projects. We focused on recent&#13;
projects and therefore excluded old experiments (Khanna, for example), even&#13;
though they were well documented. We naturally wanted to include as many&#13;
recent projects as possible, but we ended up concentrating on research, pilot,&#13;
and service projects of government and voluntary organizations. Appendix A&#13;
has profiles outlining the background, design, and effect of the experiments&#13;
and special projects. Appendix B lists other projects in India for which some&#13;
general information is available.&#13;
CHARACTERISTICS OF PROJECTS&#13;
The experiments and special projects surveyed in this paper fall into three&#13;
categories (see table 2):&#13;
o    Experimental-research projects to identify new strategies, to&#13;
test new theories of health, nutrition, and family planning, and&#13;
to compare service components and their achievements.&#13;
O    Pilot projects to test the feasibility of a strategy and its&#13;
replication.&#13;

o    Service projects to provide services in response to community&#13;
needs.&#13;
Although the differences between categories are not always substantial, the&#13;
classification is helpful--for it shows the focus and the scope, two deter-&#13;
minants of replicability. Experimental-research projects test the efficacy of&#13;
strategies and are not meant for wide replicability. Pilot projects test an&#13;
approach and a system expected to be widely replicated. Service projects&#13;
respond to a felt need and are not designed or evaluated for replication.&#13;
Services&#13;
The experiments and special projects offer services in primary health&#13;
care, nutrition, and family planning--and if not directly responsible for all&#13;
services, they have close links with parallel services. In the Applied&#13;
Nutrition Program, the staff of the primary health center worked with that of&#13;
the nutrition program by selecting clients and providing health checks and&#13;
immunizations for children. The No-Birth Bonus Scheme, primarily an incentive&#13;
plan for family planning acceptors, was closely allied with the Comprehensive&#13;
Labor Welfare Program, which provided maternal and child health services and&#13;
educational services on tea estates.&#13;
The main services of the projects, already summarized briefly in&#13;
table 1, can be classified in three ways: (a) those that provide comprehen-&#13;
sive services for health, nutrition, and family planning; (b) those that&#13;
provide an integrated set of services for health, nutrition, and family plan-&#13;
ning and in addition are engaged in rural development; and (c) those that have&#13;
specific nutrition or population objectives and that may have links with com-&#13;
plementary services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
Projects in the first category include the Mandwa, Miraj, Kasa, and&#13;
Narangwal projects and to a lesser extent the experiment in family planning in&#13;
Bangalore. The thrust of these projects has been preventive and promotional&#13;
work in maternal and child health and in nutrition, with less emphasis on&#13;
curative care. Services have for the most part been provided by the health&#13;
workers in villages. Projects in the second category are the Comprensive&#13;
Rural Health Project at Jamkhed and the Indo-Dutch Project for Child Welfare,&#13;
which sponsor a broad range of health-related services and broader development&#13;
activities. Broadly falling into the third caltegory are Project Poshak in&#13;
Madhya Pradesh, the No-Birth Bonus Scheme in South India, and the nutrition&#13;
projects in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,, and Madhya Pradesh. Each of&#13;
them has specific objectives for nutrition or family planning.&#13;
Categories of Worker&#13;
The manpower structure in primary health care encompasses many&#13;
village health workers. The pyramidal hierarchy central to this system&#13;
includes several levels of health workers, each providing support and super-&#13;
vision for those at lower levels. All workers are trained and qualified to&#13;
perform particular tasks suited to their education and competence. This&#13;
structure is efficient in the use of scarce manpower and ensures easy referral&#13;
of complicated cases to higher levels. When this system of referral works,&#13;
people in remote rural areas have access to the most sophisticated of health&#13;
services.&#13;
Although no consistent pattern of recruitment, training, and respon-&#13;
sibility is apparent, many of the projects have a hierarchical structure&#13;
similar to that for primary health care. Close communication and supervision,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
coupled with ongoing training, have been an integral part of several proj-&#13;
ects. Many inappropriate features of the western system of health care have&#13;
been avoided. Generally, the manpower structure is not top-heavy with health&#13;
professionals.&#13;
Many of the projects have been planned and developed by doctors who&#13;
have wide experience in rural health care. Physicians generally play a&#13;
central role by supervising and training paraprofessionals and by treating&#13;
complicated medical cases beyond the capabilities of paraprofessionals. The&#13;
hierarchical structure in the Kasa, Miraj, Mandwa, Jamkhed, Narangwal, and&#13;
Indo-Dutch projects--essentially the small-scale projects--has been developed&#13;
along these lines. At Jamkhed, for example, the Aroles have been directly&#13;
involved in designing and administering the training program for village-based&#13;
health workers. 1/&#13;
Many of the small projects have training courses for village health&#13;
workers, courses that emphasize practical skills and preventive and promotive&#13;
health work rather than curative skills. In Maharashtra many of the projects&#13;
sponsored a short course, usually lasting three to six weeks, to train village&#13;
workers in identifying and diagnosing illness, malnutrition, and infectious&#13;
diseases. The workers were also trained in prenatal and postnatal care, in&#13;
giving immunizations, and in other preventive work. Because many projects&#13;
emphasize ongoing training, the workers can build on the knowledge already&#13;
gained through practical training and field experience.&#13;
1. Drs. Mabelle and Rajanikant Aroles worked in a Maharashtra hospital from&#13;
1962 to 1966. Having subsequently gained three years of clinical experi-&#13;
ence and having taken a one-year course in public health abroad, the&#13;
Aroles returned to Maharashtra and initiated the Jamkhed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
The intermediate staff generally includes people with wider experi-&#13;
ence and longer training, such as auxiliary nurse midwives, paramedical&#13;
workers, and multipurpose health workers. They provide the technical guid-&#13;
ance, support, and encouragement for village workers and regularly visit the&#13;
villages to supervise health activities. Generally based at the primary&#13;
health center or unit, the intermediate workers participate in clinic activi-&#13;
ties with doctors, nurses, and other staff.&#13;
The findings from most of the small-scale projects suggest a&#13;
relatively flat organization that features closes communication between&#13;
levels. At Mandwa, for example, the project is administered by a local doctor&#13;
who supervises the work of auxiliary nurse midwives and community health&#13;
workers. Each auxiliary nurse midwife supervises the work of five community&#13;
health workers; a doctor visits the health subcenters once a week. This&#13;
system of supervision is both efficient and effiective in reaching people in&#13;
villages.&#13;
Findings from the large service prograims, particularly the Special&#13;
Nutrition Program and the Applied Nutrition Program in Kerala, highlight&#13;
several problems associated with staff. The worker-to-client ratio appears to&#13;
be low in the feeding services of the Special Nutrition Program. In urban&#13;
areas, one inspector supervises many centers, which serve up to 10,000&#13;
people. According to many evaluation studies, this supervisory system does&#13;
not appear to be effective, and the organizer at each center generally is not&#13;
trained. Monthly compensation for work at the center is low, and support for&#13;
workers is limited. In the Applied Nutrition Program in Kerala, poor co-&#13;
ordination and lack of training have been cited as two of the problems retard-&#13;
ing program development and success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
The ratios of health workers to population vary from project to&#13;
project; for many projects no figures are available. In the Maharashtra&#13;
projects (Kasa, Jamkhed, Mandwa, and Miraj), voluntary health workers on&#13;
average covered a population of 1,500 to 2,000, but the variation around these&#13;
averages was considerable. The special nutrition programs generally had one&#13;
worker and a helper to manage one feeding center that catered to 100 children&#13;
and mothers, often to more. At the supervisory level, however, the ratios are&#13;
much smaller, with one inspector supervising centers serving 10,000 benefi-&#13;
ciaries. At Narangwal one health worker covered a population of 1,500, and&#13;
contact was close between family health workers and village families. Early&#13;
diagnosis and treatment and continuous follow-up by village workers had a&#13;
major influence on the achievements there.&#13;
Population Coverage&#13;
The population covered depends on the kind of project: it probably&#13;
is larger for a single intervention project. The No-Birth Bonus Scheme covers&#13;
521 persons; the experimental program of alternative strategies in family&#13;
planning in five districts of Bangalore, as many as 1.7 million. But the&#13;
deficit between the population targeted and the population covered often is&#13;
great. The problem is in distinguishing the population at risk and the popu-&#13;
lation generally covered. So, a distinction should be drawn between projects&#13;
in which groups at risk are identified and given priority and projects in&#13;
which wide population coverage is intended. Both kinds of project can have&#13;
problems of achieving expected coverage of the target population. Project&#13;
capacity, resource and administrative limitations, and the priorities assigned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
to goals and objectives naturally are important factors affecting the ways&#13;
target groups are selected and groups at risk are identified and treated.&#13;
Several factors affect coverage. PhysiJcal access makes a big differ-&#13;
ence in reaching the target population. One study in India has shown that for&#13;
each additional half mile between the community and the health center, the&#13;
percentage of the population attending the center falls 50 percent. 1/ A&#13;
similar study has shown that 60 percent of the patients came from within a&#13;
mile of the primary health center. 2/ In general, the population covered by&#13;
the experiments and special projects is small. The cost of services and&#13;
transport also affects access, as do sociocultural determinants. The effi-&#13;
ciency and quality of services influences the use of services, an indicator of&#13;
effective access: Also influencing the use of services are the relationship&#13;
between the health staff and the community, the patients' perceptions about&#13;
their illnesses, and the opportunity cost of obtaining care.&#13;
The projects have had mixed results in covering target populatiors.&#13;
The experience in the large service-oriented projects has not been encour-&#13;
aging. Many of them provide a clinic-based, centralized system of health and&#13;
nutrition care, which excludes many of the target population for whom access&#13;
is difficult. The projects are trying to reach the vulnerable groups--mothers&#13;
and children in low-income families--but because services are available only&#13;
at clinics, the coverage excludes many people for whom the programs were&#13;
intended.&#13;

In the Applied Nutrition Program in Kerala, 25 percent of the centers&#13;
did not have the full complement of clients, and attendance rates were 30 to&#13;
40 percent below the number registered in the program. Although the study&#13;
report does not provide the number of intended clients, high drop-out rates&#13;
and problems of reaching the target group are evident. The incentives of the&#13;
program for food production were not -used as expected, either. In the Special&#13;
Nutrition Program among tribal groups in Andhra Pradesh, a substantial "take-&#13;
up rate" has been reported. The mean attendance rate was 86 percent, but many&#13;
people from the eligible groups were not receiving the supplement. In the&#13;
Mid-Day Meals Program, schools on average provided food to 16 percent more&#13;
than the allocated number of children. A distribution of participants by age&#13;
shows that 79 percent were between seven and eleven; other beneficiaries were&#13;
below or above these ages.&#13;
Outreach efforts--believed to be important in effective coverage of&#13;
health, nutrition, and family planning services--have been integral in many of&#13;
the projects, including the two Narangwal projects. The outreach of the small&#13;
projects seems to have increased the acceptance of family planning and the&#13;
coverage of target groups. 1/ In the Miraj project the proportion of family&#13;
planning acceptors rose from 20 percent in 1974 to 89 percent in 1977. The&#13;
substantial increase may, however, be in part attributed to the extensive&#13;
sterilization campaign in the state. At Jamkhed the percentage of eligible&#13;
couples practicing family planning is substantially higher than in nonproject&#13;
areas.&#13;
1. The National Family Welfare Program in India has, over the years, adopted&#13;
a new approach for reaching prospective family planning acceptors. In&#13;
1963 the outreach system was initiated when clinic-based services failed&#13;
to reduce the birth rate to targeted levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
The smaller projects have been more effective in reaching target&#13;
groups, primarily because of their extension work in the villages. Extension&#13;
services in the community have reduced or eliminated problems of access and&#13;
have enabled health and family planning workers to develop a relationship with&#13;
villagers. Village health workers at Jamkhed make house-to-house visits and&#13;
are responsible for the care and follow-up of all family planning acceptors&#13;
and all prenatal and postnatal cases. Village health aides at Miraj were&#13;
based in the village and undertook health and nuitrition responsibilities with&#13;
regular support and supervision from a visiting health team. Health workers&#13;
at Kasa, by visiting households regularly, were able to identify emerging&#13;
problems and take immediate action in response l:o needs.&#13;
But the success of these small projects masks the greater difficul-&#13;
ties that planners face in transforming them inito large-scale programs, which&#13;
raises questions about replicability. Many small projects are characterized&#13;
by their flexibility in problem-solving and their ability to change direc-&#13;
tion. In addition, smaller projects tend to have well-defined goals and&#13;
objectives. Large-scale programs often are less flexible and adhere to rigid&#13;
operational procedures, irrespective of problems identified. That is, they&#13;
tend to emphasize procedures more than goals and objectives. Pyle (1979) has&#13;
highlighted this problem and suggests that when small projects are expanded,&#13;
there is a "misfit" between the structure of a larger bureaucracy and the&#13;
newly adopted strategy. He suggests that the strategy adopted should be&#13;
modified substantially and that the intervention should be tested in the&#13;
bureaucratic and political setting.&#13;

MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECTS&#13;
In surveying the fourteen experiments and special projects, we examined the&#13;
following main elements: the integration of services, the participation of&#13;
the community, the use of auxiliary workers, the nature of supervision and&#13;
training, the use of home visits, and the selection of clients (table 3&#13;
overleaf).  We also checked whether costs and benefits were measured and&#13;
whether the outcome was evaluated.&#13;
Integration of Services&#13;
One important lesson is the efficiency of integrating services for&#13;
health, nutrition, and family planning. According to the well-documented&#13;
results of the Narangwal research, the effects of integrated services on&#13;
growth, morbidity, mortality, and family planning acceptance are all signifi-&#13;
cant. The findings suggest that prenatal nutritional care, which included a&#13;
food supplement and iron and folic acid, were strongly associated with a&#13;
reduction in the perinatal mortality rate of 40 to 50 percent. Tetanus immu-&#13;
nizations for pregnant women reduced perinatal mortality about 20 percent.&#13;
Recognizing the relation between maternal care and infant mortality,&#13;
and the synergistic relation between infection and malnutrition, many projects&#13;
focused integrated services on mothers and infants. The Mandwa project, for&#13;
example, has combined prenatal and postnatal care with nutrition and&#13;
immunization programs to achieve better birth weights, avoid neonatal tetanus,&#13;
and reduce infant mortality. Eligible couples at Jamkhed are approached at an&#13;
appropriate time to encourage their practice of family planning. Women who&#13;
have just delivered and women who have three to four children are usually&#13;
encouraged to adopt family planning when the children in the family are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
receiving continued care and follow-up. The basis of this approach is the&#13;
belief that eligible couples will not adopt family planning until they are&#13;
confident they will have their desired number of healthy children.&#13;
Nutrition surveillance has been important in some projects. The Kasa&#13;
project developed specific criteria for groups at risk. These groups were&#13;
identified through regular anthropometric measurement of children and a number&#13;
of risk factors for pregnant women. Previous history of stillbirth, abortion,&#13;
or small-for-dates babies and other clinical signs alerted health personnel to&#13;
the need for special care and surveillance. At Narangwal the growth of&#13;
children was monitored from birth until they were three, alerting project&#13;
staff to the greater risk of mortality. The findings there show that each 10&#13;
percentage point shortfall in weight-for-age exponentially increased the&#13;
probability of death.&#13;
The Narangwal results show that although health care had a major&#13;
effect on infant and child mortality--and that nutrition care alone reduced&#13;
perinatal death rates--the services, when combined, had a substantially&#13;
greater effect on mortality, morbidity, and growth (and were only slightly&#13;
more expensive). Several findings of the Narangwal population study also&#13;
point to the merits of combining services. In villages where family planning,&#13;
women's services, and child care were available, the number of contacts was&#13;
higher than in villages where only family planning and child care were avail-&#13;
able. But staff in the second group of villages spent more time delivering&#13;
the services offered. Family planning services, when combined with other&#13;
services, were more efficient both in the use of work time by family health&#13;
workers and in the cost of services. The average cost for a new acceptor of&#13;
modern methods in the second year of services was lowest when all three&#13;
&#13;

services were combined. The health outcome measured in the project, as a&#13;
proxy for the effect of child care, was death of children from birth to age&#13;
three. Cost-effectiveness calculations show that the cost of an averted death&#13;
was slightly less in villages with all three services combined.&#13;
The need for integrating services is underlined by the experiences of&#13;
single interventions. For example, the Special Nutrition Program--launched by&#13;
the government in 1971 with the main objective of providing supplementary&#13;
nutrition for preschool children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers--has had&#13;
problems. Concern has been expressed about whether the feeding-only strategy&#13;
of the project adequately addresses the health and nutritional needs of the&#13;
target groups. The Integrated Child Development Scheme--a large pilot project&#13;
currently under way in India is designed to meet the health, social, nutri-&#13;
tional, and educational needs of children in the preschool age group as well&#13;
as those of pregnant and nursing mothers. Begun in late 1975, it is a multi-&#13;
faceted project to deal with the many problems of health and nutrition among&#13;
the vulnerable groups. Preliminary findings from a stratified random sample&#13;
survey of children under six show a major decline in the percentage of&#13;
malnourished children over a two-year period.&#13;
Community Participation&#13;
Communities can participate in the development of a health care&#13;
system in many ways and at different stages. These include having the&#13;
community take part in the planning and identification of programs to solve&#13;
their health needs; having the community help in prevention, promotion, and&#13;
the collection of epidemiological or other relevant data; and having the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
community pay a fee for services, make salary payments to health workers, or&#13;
provide materials and labor for construction.&#13;
The Jamkhed project got the community to take part by first approach-&#13;
ing village leaders with proposals for the comprehensive health care services&#13;
and implementing the desired services with community cooperation. The project&#13;
became increasingly self-sufficient: in 1978 patient fees covered three-&#13;
quarters of the recurrent expenses (Gwatkin and others 1980). The communities&#13;
donated land, provided materials, and offered their services in setting up the&#13;
community health facilities. The project also enlisted local community&#13;
groups, such as Young Farmers Clubs, to help conduct mass immunization and&#13;
nutrition programs.&#13;
Many of the small projects worked through gram panchayats (village&#13;
committees) and made no attempt to bypass the village hierarchy or to chal-&#13;
lenge sociopolitical structures. At Mandwa the project objectives were not in&#13;
line with vested interests in the villages. Local health committees were&#13;
formed to oversee programs and to assist community health workers in&#13;
preventive health work. The project director reports that the enthusiasm of&#13;
those committees has waned substantially because the project is directed&#13;
toward the poorer sections of the community and not so apparently beneficial&#13;
to the most vocal members of the community, who make up the committees (Antia&#13;
1980). But the community still pays part of the health workers' salaries and&#13;
pays for medicine.&#13;
At Narangwal efforts were made, before and after projects were&#13;
launched, to inform communities and to encourage their participation (Taylor&#13;
and others, forthcoming). Throughout the project's life, villagers assisted&#13;
in organizing and executed all major vaccination projects. Villagers provided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
food and equipment for a special day-care center and made payments in kind to&#13;
women locally recruited to manage the program. Vital statistics were col-&#13;
lected through a variety of sources, including village reports. The communi-&#13;
ties provided buildings for use as health subcenters and feeding centers.&#13;
Village participation was reported to be in accord with the objectives of the&#13;
project.&#13;
In the Kasa and Miraj projects the community was not involved to any&#13;
great extent. About these two projects, Pyle (1979) has suggested that the&#13;
projects are effective only as long as the voluntary agency or government&#13;
supports them. Once support is withdrawn, the project cannot survive.&#13;
The problems of the Indo-Dutch project are common to many others.&#13;
When it was begun as a pilot project in late 1969 in the Hyderabad District of&#13;
Andhra Pradesh, planners expected that international donors could gradually&#13;
withdraw as community involvement increased. Communities were slow in re-&#13;
sponding, however, and it is now expected the project will continue with the&#13;
same inputs until 1985. Of several problems, one is the time at which the&#13;
community was asked to participate. The first approach was to provide&#13;
clinics, health care, and nutritional supplements without any community in-&#13;
put. In 1973, four years after the start of the project, project organizers&#13;
asked the local communities to contribute toward health care services and to&#13;
pay membership fees for women's groups and child care services. The sluggish&#13;
response has encouraged project leaders in the expanded project in Hyderabad&#13;
to approach the community before providing services.&#13;
The large-scale service projects in nutrition generally have not been&#13;
effective in engaging the participation of the community, but community&#13;
involvement in the nutrition project at Andhra Pradesh was considerable. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
the Applied Nutrition Program, gram panchayats provide food utensils and pay a&#13;
ten-rupee allowance to workers. In the mid-day feeding project in Madhya&#13;
Pradesh, no direct parental or community involvement is reported, although the&#13;
community has expressed positive views about the project.&#13;
If community participation is confined to the traditional power&#13;
structure (such as gram panchayats), these structures may be strengthened, and&#13;
the inequalities villages increased. At Mandwa the project managers worked&#13;
with village committees to reach target groups. These committees, composed of&#13;
the most vocal members of the community, lost interest when they saw they had&#13;
little to gain from promoting the project. At Jamkhed the community partici-&#13;
pation went beyond the established power structure. Although health workers&#13;
were encouraged to avoid politics, the development of broadly based health&#13;
services impinged on the power structure there. The project directors were in&#13;
one instance asked to urge one of their workers to withdraw from local com-&#13;
munity elections, fearing the worker would unseat the incumbent.&#13;
Use of Auxiliary Workers&#13;
Many of the projects relied largely on paraprofessional staff to&#13;
deliver preventive and simple curative services and to do promotional work in&#13;
the villages. In the Indo-Dutch Project community health volunteers provide&#13;
basic health and nutritional services to the community and monitor changes in&#13;
health and growth of children. In the Jamkhed project the village health&#13;
workers, usually women the community selects, are important in delivering&#13;
health services. People in villages can ident:Lfy with the worker, who&#13;
emphasizes promotional and preventive health work and makes it more acceptable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
to the community. In the Narangwal project the family health workers treated&#13;
simple conditions and provided health care and follow-up to children receiving&#13;
services. Their work accounts for a large part of the project's success.&#13;
Basic to primary health care is that village health workers, indig-&#13;
enous to the area, should provide health, nutrition, and related services at&#13;
the periphery of the health system. Many projects (Miraj, Kasa, and Jamkhed)&#13;
have used the skills of traditional miidwives and practitioners; others (Mandwa&#13;
and Indo-Dutch) have recruited new cadres of workers and trained and assigned&#13;
them to the villages they come from. Village health workers are men or women&#13;
usually able to read and write, chosen by the community (or with its agree-&#13;
ment), and trained to deal with community problems. They are paid in cash or&#13;
in kind by the community for the health functions they perform full-time or&#13;
part-time. They are part of the health team working at the periphery.&#13;
There is no single system of recruiting a particular kind of health&#13;
worker. Some projects have engaged workers who had previous experience in the&#13;
government health services; others recruited and trained workers with no&#13;
experience in health care. The education of workers also varied substan-&#13;
tially, ranging from ten years of general education and further medical&#13;
training (as at Narangwal) to illiterate (as for women chosen as village&#13;
health workers in Mandwa and Jamkhed). Few low-level workers in the large&#13;
nutrition projects had training in nutrition intervention. There was clearly&#13;
a preference for female staff, primarily because many services are more&#13;
acceptable if delivered by a woman. Middle-aged women with children of their&#13;
own had often been chosen by the community to provide informal health services&#13;
before their recruitment into the projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Many projects have emphasized the role of paraprofessionals in pro-&#13;
viding health care and have developed suitable practical training plans.&#13;
Short training courses of one to six weeks have been found most satisfactory&#13;
in preparing health workers for their respective assignments. Training is&#13;
close to the villages, and priority is given to practical skills. Ongoing&#13;
training needs are also met by regular in-service teaching and discussion, a&#13;
method that has been particularly successful in augmenting the worker's&#13;
knowledge and skills.&#13;
o    The Jamkhed project has emphasized two-way learning:  case&#13;
studies are discussed weekly, basged on the experience of health&#13;
workers during the preceding week. This alerts the project&#13;
directors and other professional staff to the problems and&#13;
perceptions of the community, and reinforces the health workers'&#13;
training by continuing education.&#13;
o    The Kasa project had some problems in recruiting village health&#13;
workers. Although female workers were preferred, few women who&#13;
met the criteria were willing to work in isolated areas. About&#13;
60 percent of the workers recruited were men, for whom drop-out&#13;
rates were high because of the increased demand for labor during&#13;
harvest periods.&#13;
o    The preservice training of family health workers at Narangwal&#13;
initially took eighteen weeks but was later compressed to six&#13;
weeks without an apparent loss in technical skills. All family&#13;
health workers at Narangwal had a high school education,&#13;
previous training as lady health visitors, and follow-up&#13;
training in health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
o    At Jamkhed 80 percent of the many village health workers are&#13;
illiterate. The experience there suggests that illiterates can&#13;
provide efficient services and handle 90 percent of the cases,&#13;
including diagnosis and treatment.&#13;
o    The Mandwa project, in an attempt to have an immediate effect on&#13;
village health problems, initially used many health profes-&#13;
sionals, but this proved counterproductive. Highly trained&#13;
personnel in the project expected rapid changes and had&#13;
difficulty in adapting to the slower pace of village life. The&#13;
project is now directed by one health professional; community&#13;
health workers and auxiliary nurse midwives provide preventive&#13;
and curative services.&#13;
o    In Madhya Pradesh the feeding program is run by the organizers&#13;
of each center with the help and support of teaching staff and&#13;
students. Because half the schools do not have a cook assigned&#13;
to the program, students and teachers are responsible for much&#13;
of the preparation and distribution of food.&#13;
Supervision and Training&#13;
The more successful projects share many characteristics in their&#13;
health manpower, in their supervisory system, and in their training pro-&#13;
grams. First, they selected front-line workers from the community. This made&#13;
it possible for health workers to voice the needs of the community and to play&#13;
a central role in meeting the health needs of the target population. The&#13;
workers could deliver simple curative and preventive services and cover dis-&#13;
persed village communities. Second, the more successful projects were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
developed by health professionals familiar with local health problems and&#13;
community needs. Third, they developed an effective supervisory and training&#13;
system. Results invariably were better in smaller projects with careful&#13;
supervision: we have already noted that two continuous training programs&#13;
based on the day-to-day experiences of workers at Kasa and Jamkhed produced&#13;
significantly better results. Fourth, the better projects had workers take&#13;
part in setting priorities. Fifth, those projects collected epidemiological&#13;
data, identified community needs, and assessed service packages in relation to&#13;
targets for health, nutrition, and family planning.&#13;
Here are a few examples. In the Narangwal population project, family&#13;
health workers offered various services to groups of villages, and the proj-&#13;
ect's impact on contraceptive use was measured longitudinally. At Jamkhed and&#13;
Kasa, workers were directly involved in setting priorities, identifying&#13;
community problems, and delivering services to groups at risk. The results of&#13;
these projects have been encouraging. But in the Special Nutrition Program,&#13;
which shares few of the characteristics just listed, the nutrition organizer&#13;
is neither properly trained nor supervised, and evaluation reports suggest&#13;
that workers have become despondent.&#13;
Use of Home Visits&#13;
The primary health center, the subcenter, and extensive home visits&#13;
are basic elements of many of the projects. At Narangwal, Kasa, Jamkhed,&#13;
Miraj, Mandwa, and Chevella in the Indo-Dutch project, the health care system&#13;
has been based on outreach and on integrated services. These projects have&#13;
developed a system of regular house-to-house visits to collect information and&#13;
epidemiological data, to follow up on cases under surveillance, and to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
identify and treat particular conditions and groups in need of special care.&#13;
At Narangwal this system was important in the early recognition and care of&#13;
illnesses and malnutrition. Home visiting appears to be effective both in&#13;
reaching target groups and in providing services to meet basic needs.&#13;
Project Poshak and the large nutrition projects had no outreach&#13;
program. Mothers and children attended a central clinic, as in Poshak, or a&#13;
nutrition center to collect food or attend the feeding program. The projects&#13;
did not provide for an initial house-to-house recruitment campaign of eligible&#13;
family members or for the follow-up of drop-outs. Project staff were thus&#13;
unable to identify emerging health or nutrition problems or to obtain up-to-&#13;
date information on the effect of projects on the target groups. In addition,&#13;
the findings reported by these projects suggest that target group coverage was&#13;
not substantial and the drop-out rates were high. The No-Birth Bonus Scheme&#13;
in South India nevertheless recruited many eligible couples without home&#13;
visits. But this was a single-purpose project, and the environment of the&#13;
project made recruitment and follow-up simpler than in the broader programs.&#13;
Increased emphasis on outreach generally led to better use and better&#13;
coverage for the percentage of the population at risk. The Narangwal experi-&#13;
ence shows that the greater the reliance on home visits, the greater the use&#13;
of services by low-income groups. Home visits were weekly in villages with&#13;
services for family planning and child care, and neonatal deaths were reduced&#13;
most for low-caste children. The villages with combined services for family&#13;
planning, women's care, and child care had only monthly outreach visits. As a&#13;
result, fewer low-caste families were reached, and reductions in neonatal&#13;
mortality were moderate, most of which were in the high-caste group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Selection of Clients&#13;
Many of the health and nutrition projects, particularly in the large&#13;
nutrition programs, had no criteria based on the health and nutritional status&#13;
of mothers and children. Without such criteria the problem, as in the Applied&#13;
Nutrition Program, is the failure to reach the neediest members of the com-&#13;
munity--low-income families. It may be unacceptable to limit participation by&#13;
nutrition level. There is, in addition, the practical difficulty of screening&#13;
all participants. At Kasa, criteria were set to determine eligibility for the&#13;
special nutrition supplement; political repercussions were reduced by a com-&#13;
munity education program given by part-time social workers based in the vil-&#13;
lages.   Analysis of Project Poshak shows that the main target group--the&#13;
hutbound toddler of low-income families--did not participate to the extent&#13;
expected primarily because of time and social constraints. A selection pro-&#13;
cess would to a large extent overcome these problems.&#13;
The main screening procedure in many smaller projects is the charting&#13;
of weight on the "Under 5" card (Morley weight chart). Children are also&#13;
screened for simple ailments, such as fever, diarrhea, and skin and eye&#13;
conditions. Because findings, treatments, and immunizations are recorded on&#13;
the cards, projects can track changes in morbidity and growth over time. The&#13;
Kasa project was able to hold the proportion of members receiving supplemen-&#13;
tary nutritional care to 23 percent of the population under five by using the&#13;
following critieria: low birth weight, weights below 65 percent of Harvard&#13;
standards, no weight gain in three consecutive months, loss of weight in two&#13;
successive months, or such illnesses as measles or gastroenteritis. At&#13;
Jamkhed and Miraj the screening is similar to that at Kasa, and participation&#13;
in special project activities is restricted mainly to the vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
In many of the large service programs, project planners usually set&#13;
age criteria. In several special nutrition programs, however, many children&#13;
outside the age group were admitted. Another important factor was the need,&#13;
identified in Poshak, to make "pre-implementation visits to the target popula-&#13;
tion to establish rapport" (Gopaldas 1975). If selection and participation&#13;
are based on age and not on morbidity and nutrition, projects often fail to&#13;
reach the most vulnerable groups. At Narangwal, nutrition and medical care&#13;
services relied on surveillance. Problems were identified by family health&#13;
workers. Treatment was prompt, and growth was monitored consistently. If&#13;
children missed more than seven consecutive days of feeding, homes were&#13;
visited to find out why. This method of selection and continued follow-up of&#13;
cases had a major influence on the growth of children in the nutrition care&#13;
villages.&#13;
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS ABOUT COST AND BENEFIT&#13;
An evaluation of cost and benefit is needed to judge the usefulness and&#13;
replicability of the projects. Table 4 (overleaf) provides a brief summary of&#13;
the reported impact of the various projects--and if available, the per capita&#13;
cost and annual cost of services. The Poshak, Narangwal, and Andhra Pradesh&#13;
figures are probably the most reliable. For several projects, only rough&#13;
approximation of expenditure is possible. In many of the small projects--&#13;
Kasa, Jamkhed, Miraj, and Mandwa--such inputs as donated food and labor are&#13;
not included in the cost. Analysis of cost differences across projects has&#13;
little meaning because of differences in services, in the time span of proj-&#13;
ects, in the size and type of target group, and above all in cost accounting,&#13;
which usually is inadequate or incomplete. It also is impossible to compare&#13;
costs and benefits of projects because of fundamental problems in measuring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
benefits (see the later discussion). Some cost comparisons nevertheless are&#13;
possible.&#13;
At Narangwal the annual per capita cost of services was Rs 6.00 to&#13;
Rs 15.00 ($0.80 to $2.00) for the nutrition project and slightly higher for&#13;
the parallel population project. 1/ Average anrnual per capita cost for each&#13;
service ranged from Rs 8.70 to Rs 21.30 ($1.16 to $2.84) in the population&#13;
project. The estimated per capita expenditure for services at government&#13;
primary health centers in Punjab was Rs 2.00 to Rs 3.00 ($0.27 to $0.40) in&#13;
1968 and 1969. The Narangwal study group estimated that the project costs for&#13;
combined services could be reduced by half (that is, to $1.07) if the project&#13;
used government medical stores, if personnel received the lower fringe&#13;
benefits typical of government personnel, and if food were free. Even though&#13;
the cost would still be high (about four times that of government services),&#13;
the researchers suggested that the per capita cost, expressed in relation to&#13;
the population served by the two types of programs, would be similar. It&#13;
might be too much, however, to expect that program efficiency could be&#13;
maintained using fewer resources.&#13;
The Poshak annual cost figures, Rs 110 to Rs 114 per beneficiary&#13;
($14.67 to $15.26), are high, even higher than those for the government&#13;
nutrition programs; the main expenditure was on food. The findings about&#13;
costs and coverage of target groups are not encouraging.&#13;
In general the per capita expenditure in smaller projects that&#13;
combine health, nutrition, and population are fairly low--Rs 3.70 to Rs 21.30&#13;
($0.49-$2.84)--and compares favorably with those by government. Measurement&#13;
in these projects is complicated, however, by the problem of valuing financial&#13;

and social costs. Many of the projects used highly skilled personnel to&#13;
collect data, undertake various service functions, and manage the project's&#13;
activities.  In India the cost of goods and services on local markets does not&#13;
reflect their real costs because of distortions in the economy.  So it is dif-&#13;
ficult to evaluate the extent to which projects could assign costs to services&#13;
in a way that reflects the social opportunity cost of labor. For example, in&#13;
one of the smaller projects the director, a medical doctor, worked part-time&#13;
and on weekends to develop the project. He was unwilling to include his own&#13;
time and effort in the cost estimates because he believed that his time and&#13;
skills were not at a premium.&#13;
Measuring benefits is much more difficult than measuring costs.&#13;
First, the output (the immediate result) and outcome (the final result) cannot&#13;
always be clearly defined. Second, even when outcome measures can be defined,&#13;
they cannot always be clearly ascribed to the use of services. Third, giving&#13;
dollar values to outcomes, which is necessary to measure benefits in compari-&#13;
son with costs or with benefits of other projects, is even more difficult.&#13;
Thus cost-benefit analysis is inappropriate for evaluating these projects.&#13;
But the effectiveness of the projects can be discussed by considering outputs&#13;
and outcomes.  Cost-effectiveness can also be analyzed by looking at cost-to-&#13;
output and cost-to-outcome ratios.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Few of the studies provide comprehensive data on outcomes, but many&#13;
have data on outputs. These data relate to coverage of the target populations.&#13;
and the use of services. But even if formal controls were established, it was&#13;
difficult to demonstrate that project inputs were responsible for changes in&#13;
growth, morbidity, or infant and child mortality. The Narangwal studies--&#13;
two of the few well-controlled field research projects--are exceptions, for&#13;
they showed the strong relation between health-related changes and project&#13;
inputs. For example, the perinatal mortality rate was reduced 40 to 50&#13;
percent in villages with nutrition services; this major decline is strongly&#13;
associated with prenatal care and nutrition supplements for mothers.&#13;
At Jamkhed, findings from the treatment and control areas show a&#13;
marked difference in infant and child mortality rates and in the percentage of&#13;
eligible couples practicing family planning. The change in the trend of these&#13;
rates is large for a five-year period, but the comparability of the groups is&#13;
not known. Still, it is unlikely that the downward trends would have been as&#13;
rapid without project services.&#13;
Five projects--Kasa, Jamkhed, Narangwal, Miraj, and the No-Birth&#13;
Bonus Scheme--have an upward trend in rates of family planning acceptance&#13;
and, where recorded, a downward trend in infant mortality. In the Kasa&#13;
project the weight of severely malnourished children substantially improved&#13;
after one year of supplementary feeding for groups at risk. The number of&#13;
sterilizations also went up substantially over a three-year period. The&#13;
No-Birth Bonus Scheme shows the downward trend in the crude birth rate to&#13;
be fairly substantial in project areas. Such intervening factors as the&#13;
nationwide family planning campaign may have affected the response, but the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
decline in the birth rate of controls was much slower. At Narangwal the&#13;
proportion of new family planning acceptors was highest in areas offering&#13;
combined services--it was 44 percent for the group receiving family planning,&#13;
child care, and women's services; 42 percent for the group receiving only&#13;
family planning and women's services; 38 percent for the group receiving&#13;
family planning and child care; and'20 percent for the group receiving only&#13;
family planning and education.&#13;
The large nutrition projects have been evaluated using cross-&#13;
sectional studies some years after the programs began. In the feeding&#13;
program in Madhya Pradesh schools, CARE undertook a study to determine the&#13;
effect of the school meal on nutrition and school attendance. The study&#13;
was also to determine the extent to which the school meal replaces food&#13;
normally consumed at home. Anthropometric data were collected; home dietary&#13;
information was collected through 24-hour recall; attendance rates were&#13;
collected from school records. No control groups were available, and the&#13;
measurement was based on a study comparing children with "more exposure" to&#13;
the feeding program and those with "less exposure." Children in higher-&#13;
program-efficiency schools with greater exposure to the program were com-&#13;
pared with children from lower-program-efficiency schools with less exposure&#13;
to the program. The findings show that the program had a positive impact&#13;
on the growth of children and on malnutrition in the schools with efficient&#13;
programs. Schools with inefficient programs had proportionately more upper&#13;
class children with better educated parents, and it can be concluded that&#13;
socioeconomic factors were responsible for the higher attendance rates&#13;
recorded in low efficiency schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Some of the nutrition studies compared national, state, and project&#13;
figures. General findings indicate lower weights for project children in some&#13;
of the studies. A comparison of tribal children in Andhra Pradesh in the&#13;
Special Nutrition Program (SNP) shows that supplemented children were taller&#13;
and heavier than unsupplemented children of the same tribal group. The&#13;
percentage of children classified as normal, according to Indian averages,&#13;
was higher in the supplemented group in the same tribe. Other findings are&#13;
inconclusive.&#13;
In the experiment on alternative strategies in family planning in&#13;
Bangalore, evaluation of primary health care suggests that the involvement&#13;
of a voluntary agency and the technical competence of staff had significant&#13;
effects on family planning. The use of incentives in kind had mixed results.&#13;
The use of services for family planning and maternal and child health improved&#13;
during the study period for three of the strategies adopted, but administra-&#13;
tive difficulties in procurement and handling were encountered throughout the&#13;
project. There are no comprehensive data on outcome for the project.&#13;
The output data for many of the better-documented projects show&#13;
that a comprehensive program of integrated services for health, nutrition,&#13;
and family planning appears to be more cost-effective than many of the large&#13;
single interventions.&#13;
Project researchers at Narangwal calculated the cost of service&#13;
inputs in relation to outcome measures to obtain cost-effectiveness ratios&#13;
for the different packages of services: cost per death averted, per day&#13;
of illness averted, per additional centimeter of growth at thirty-six months,&#13;
and per additional percentage-point increase in psychomotor development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
score to age three.  The lowest cost for a death averted (in 1970 prices) was&#13;
$7.75--for the cost of prenatal child care per perinatal death averted in&#13;
villages with nutrition care. The costs per infant death averted and per&#13;
child death averted were lowest in the villages with health care: $25 and&#13;
$31. Nutrition services and combined health and nutrition services were much&#13;
more costly per child death averted.&#13;
Combined health and nutrition services were most cost-effective&#13;
for growth. According to the morbidity indicators, health care is the&#13;
most cost-effective program at Narangwal. The findings suggest that combined&#13;
programs, although slightly more expensive than single interventions such&#13;
as health or nutrition have made a formidable impact on growth, mortality,&#13;
and morbidity. For the population project at Narangwal, estimates of the&#13;
average number of couples practicing family planning during the second&#13;
year of services show the cost of services per practicing couple to have&#13;
been lowest ($10.27) in villages with integrated services for family planning,&#13;
women-s care, and child care. The average cost of family planning services&#13;
per new acceptor of a modern family planning method during the second year&#13;
of services also was lowest ($12.27) in those villages. The data on other&#13;
projects are limited. Costs were not related to outcome measures, although&#13;
one or two projects were able to determine cost of services, such as the cost&#13;
per child vaccinated.&#13;
Advocates of an integrated package of services assert that separate&#13;
(conventional) services for health, nutrition, and family planning could be&#13;
replaced by an integrated package of services with wide coverage of the&#13;
population at a cost comparable to present health expenditure in India.&#13;

METHODS OF MONITORING PROJECTS AND ANALYZING THEIR EFFECT&#13;
The experiments and special projects offer some methodological guidelines for&#13;
measuring project performance. Few projects used formal controls to test the&#13;
effect of interventions on the experimental or service group. In many cases,&#13;
output indicators were used to measure performance. 1/ Most studies had weak&#13;
or invalid controls, or measured project findings over time. Without a con-&#13;
trol group, it is difficult to show definitively that project inputs have been&#13;
responsible for changes in health, nutrition, or family planning. Changes&#13;
ascribed to project interventions may be caused by self-selection, time of&#13;
year, aging of the study population, and other socioeconomic variables.&#13;
In the Narangwal population project, socioeconomic differences&#13;
between control and experimental groups emerged after the project started:&#13;
for example, differences in literacy rates, sex ratios, caste distribution,&#13;
village infrastructure, and socioeconomic levels. Control children were also&#13;
heavier and taller than experimental group children. In essence, the control&#13;
group was better off than the experimental groups, but multivariate analyses&#13;
of individuals were able to correct these differences. In Project Poshak the&#13;
control phase of the project lasted only a year. A decreased mortality rate&#13;
was reported among treatment children, but compared with age-matched controls&#13;
the difference was not statistically significant, and there was no follow-up&#13;
of families that migrated from the area.&#13;
1.   These included coverage and use rates:  for example, the number of&#13;
antenatal cases attended, immunizations performed, and family planning&#13;
acceptors recruited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
Self-selection poses difficulties for project design and evaluation.&#13;
In some villages the people are receptive to innovations, such as a proposed&#13;
health center or nutrition project, and these villages may differ substantial-&#13;
ly from villages selected as controls. At Jamkhed the project directors&#13;
agreed to work only in villages where community participation in the project&#13;
was acceptable to the people and where the people were involved in planning&#13;
and implementation. The comparative analysis of findings for the control&#13;
group and for the project area is thus weakened.&#13;
In many studies the sample groups were not large enough for findings&#13;
to be significant. In the Narangwal nutrition study, mortality rates declined&#13;
but may have been affected by migration to and from the project area. Although&#13;
project staff were vigilant in tracing cases, one missed death could substan-&#13;
tially change the rates. For many of the groups, the number of deaths was too&#13;
small to be significant. At Jamkhed the declines in infant mortality rates&#13;
were shown to be substantial over a five-year period, but the sample was too&#13;
small for the findings to be significant.&#13;
The Kasa, Mandwa, and Miraj projects used no controls but measured&#13;
project activities and results over time. In the Kasa project, infants and&#13;
children were regularly surveyed by the use of a weight chart. At any time&#13;
during the project, workers could easily determine what children in the&#13;
project area needed special care, how many immunizations had been carried&#13;
out, and what the number of antenatal cases was in the area. There was a&#13;
before-and-after evaluation of the alternative strategies project in Bangalore&#13;
in family planning to determine its effects on family planning practice.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

But the experimental and control groups were nolt matched, and several imple-&#13;
mentation problems made the evaluation of inputs difficult. In the Special&#13;
Nutrition Project in Tamil Nadu, findings of a cross-sectional survey were&#13;
compared with state and national figures to evaluate the effect of the inter-&#13;
vention on the study group. Analysis of this kind is unsatisfactory because&#13;
of the many differences in nutrition and in infant and child mortality between&#13;
states and areas. For example, project workers at Jamkhed found large dif-&#13;
ferences between the infant mortality rate in the town of Jamkhed and that in&#13;
the surrounding rural areas.&#13;
Retrospective studies are common in I;ndia, and many service-oriented&#13;
programs collect no baseline data. This appears to be so in many of the&#13;
large-scale interventions of the government. In the Special Nutrition Program,&#13;
for example, five representative centers were compared in Coimbatore, Tamil&#13;
Nadu -- measuring weight, height, and dietary intake. The problem of such a&#13;
comparative analysis is that it can be misleading for project planners. The&#13;
dietary information was collected by recall, which often is inaccurate.&#13;
Anthropometric data were compared with that for all India and for Tamil Nadu.&#13;
A second study in Tamil Nadu recorded anthropometric data over six months.&#13;
The findings reveal fairly substantial growth for the study group during that&#13;
period, but whether the intervention brought about these changes cannot be&#13;
determined with this kind of analysis.&#13;
Constraints of time, finance, and personnel apparently induced&#13;
many project leaders to evaluate outputs rather than outcomes. Such eval-&#13;
uation has recognized shortcomings, but given the constraints and objectives&#13;
of many projects, sophisticated techniques of data collection and analysis&#13;
would be inappropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Output measures were adopted in most of the projects, but a few&#13;
projects--Kasa, Jamkhed, and Narangwal, for example--measured such outcome&#13;
indicators as infant and child mortality rates, nutritional levels, and family&#13;
planning acceptors, and fertility levels. Even so, it is difficult to estab-&#13;
lish a definite relation between project interventions and changes observed&#13;
in mortality, morbidity, growth, or fertility. In the Narangwal study, recall&#13;
by mothers in measuring morbidity changes was so detailed that results are&#13;
inconclusive. Two-thirds of the variance in weight of children could not be&#13;
explained, even after the large number of variables and project inputs were&#13;
taken into account.&#13;
Output measures reflect changes in the use of services and in&#13;
the type of service coverage: for example, the proportion of children&#13;
immunized, the number of tuberculosis cases under treatment, or the number&#13;
of deliveries attended by health workers. The Kasa, Indo-Dutch, and Mandwa&#13;
projects are among those that use output measures to evaluate project per-&#13;
formance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
CONCLUSIONS&#13;
The findings from the survey of experiments and special projects are not&#13;
conclusive. There still are many gaps in knowledge about these projects and&#13;
about the potential contribution of project services, particularly that of&#13;
primary health care. The contributions of various factors to project accom-&#13;
plishments, the service packages adopted, and the final effects of different&#13;
interventions are still not fully understood. The potential for replicating&#13;
services on a large scale also needs to be assessed with a focus on cost,&#13;
institutional requirements, and implementation problems. The favorable&#13;
results of some of the small projects are relevant for policy.&#13;
o    First, the integration of services for health, nutrition, and family&#13;
planning is important.&#13;
o    Second, auxiliary health workers, and the outreach services they&#13;
deliver, greatly increase physical access. The home visits in&#13;
various projects overcame many problems of reaching the most vul-&#13;
nerable groups. In addition, community participation seems to be&#13;
important in planning and implementation.&#13;
But scaling up small experiments and special projects to large, effective&#13;
service programs is complex. The population covered by such experiments and&#13;
projects is small in comparison with the statewide need for services in&#13;
health, nutrition, and population--and minute in comparison with the needs&#13;
of all India. For example, the Maharashtra projects covered about 400,000&#13;
persons, less than 0.8 percent of the population of the state.&#13;
One major problem is the inflexibility of large programs and of&#13;
the bureaucracy. Small projects can be flexible--in their system of&#13;
management, in the way they deliver services, and in the ability to change&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
course on the basis of new findings.  What is needed?  Experimentation and&#13;
research on operations to modify institutional arrangements in a way that&#13;
accommodates much of the flexibility that is so important to the success of&#13;
smaller projects. For example, innovative measures could be tried out in&#13;
statewide or districtwide services to demonstrate their efficacy. The&#13;
measures that work best (and fit bes,t) could then be incorporated in the new&#13;
program. What has complicated this so far is that among the successful&#13;
projects no single kind of project stands out. Different kinds of projects&#13;
work well in different conditions. That means that a nationwide blanket&#13;
program would be inappropriate in many parts of the country and that programs&#13;
should be sufficiently flexible to be modified to local conditions--a problem&#13;
which is likely to be exacerbated by the inflexibility of the national&#13;
level bureaucracy.&#13;
A further difficulty in considering replication of the experiments&#13;
and special projects is that there is not enough information on them--because&#13;
of the problems inherent in measuring outcome and the inadequacy of the&#13;
systems for collecting data and for monitoring and evaluating progress. These&#13;
problems preclude systematic analysis of what projects have achieved and what&#13;
interventions have meant for the population covered by services. Part of the&#13;
difficulty is that the most reliable indicators of project achievements--&#13;
outcome indicators of growth, morbidity, and mortality--are the most difficult&#13;
to measure and collect. So output indicators (of coverage and use) are often&#13;
used instead. Less reliable than outcome indicators, they are less convincing&#13;
(and possibly less correct) in demonstrating how, what, where, and for whom&#13;
services should be provided. The complexities inherent in monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
evaluating projects must be surmounted so that it is possible to get early&#13;
warnings about what is going wrong and to get the information needed to make&#13;
decisions about program development and policy. The first step is to collect&#13;
good baseline data. Also needed is better financial and economic analysis.&#13;
Poor in most of the projects surveyed, the costing of services and benefits&#13;
is precisely what is needed to compare the benefits and efficiency of dif-&#13;
ferent packages of services--and to estimate whaLt replication on a large&#13;
scale will cost. Simply multiplying per capita costs by population is not&#13;
good enough, for there may be economies (and diseconomies) of scale. In&#13;
addition, when considering the broad replication of an experiment or special&#13;
project, and intangible but very important factor in their success must be&#13;
kept in mind: Most of the experiments and special projects are the results&#13;
of the drive and initiative of individuals. This factor usually makes exact&#13;
replication impossible. The experiments and special projects nevertheless&#13;
offer, as this review shows, many important lessons that have general appli-&#13;
cability.&#13;

NARANGWAL NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
The Narangwal nutrition study (1968-74) was a major field research project&#13;
designed to examine the relations between infection and nutrition and to&#13;
analyze the impact of several service packages on the cycle of infection and&#13;
malnutrition. The study was conducted at the Narangwal Rural Health Research&#13;
Center in Punjab. A parallel study--the Narangwal population project--was&#13;
also conducted by the research team.&#13;
The nutrition study was done in ten villages with a total population&#13;
of about 10,500 located around two community development blocks in the Ludhiana&#13;
District of Punjab. The Indian Council of Medical Research, the World Health&#13;
Organization, the National Institute of Health, and the Agency for Interna-&#13;
tional Development provided funding. The Indian Council of Medical Research&#13;
and the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health ran the&#13;
project.&#13;
Design and Objectives&#13;
The main objectives of the study were to determine the effect of&#13;
nutrition and medical care--alone and in combination--on the growth, mor-&#13;
bidity, and mortality of children under three. The cost-effectiveness of the&#13;
service packages was analyzed and the project incorporated health care and&#13;
services that auxiliary health workers could provide.&#13;
The 1,000 infants and children in the target population and women of&#13;
reproductive age were divided into four groups: a control group, which was&#13;
provided no services beyond emergency and minimal symptomatic treatment, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
three experimental groups, which were provided different packages of medical&#13;
and nutrition services.  Data on weight, height, and morbidity were collected&#13;
in a weekly recall by mothers of the occurrence, onset, and duration of forty-&#13;
four signs and symptoms. Data on fertility and mortality were collected by&#13;
specially appointed data collectors. Baseline data on morbidity and body&#13;
measurements were collected for one year before services were provided; ser-&#13;
vice components were introduced sequentially.&#13;
Services&#13;
Two villages constituted a control group with no special services.&#13;
Each of the three experimental groups of villages received different services.&#13;
The first group received only nutrition care, including regular nutrition&#13;
monitoring, selected food supplementation for children and pregnant women, and&#13;
nutrition education with particular emphasis on the importance of late weaning&#13;
and of introducing supplementary foods early in the infant's life. The two&#13;
villages in the second group received medical care. Health workers visited&#13;
homes, treated minor ailments, provided routine immunization, and provided&#13;
curative services at village clinics. A physician visited the village clinics&#13;
weekly, and infants and children were examined weekly. The third group of&#13;
villages received combined medical and nutrition care and family planning&#13;
services.&#13;
The services were provided by family health workers who had six&#13;
weeks of training and follow-up training in the field. Physicians, nutri-&#13;
tionists, and public health nurses trained and supervised the health workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
Findings&#13;
Growth. Nutrition care alone or in combination with health care&#13;
increased significantly the weight and height of children older than seventeen&#13;
months. Mean weights and heights in villages with health care were between&#13;
those in villages with nutrition care and control villages. Treatment child-&#13;
ren were 500-600 grams heavier and 2-13 millimeters taller than others at&#13;
thirty-six months. Sex and caste were shown to have a pronounced independent&#13;
and additive effect on growth. Nutrition care had a major effect on perinatal&#13;
mortality, reducing it 40 to 50 percent, apparently because of the provision&#13;
of supplementary food, iron, and folic acid to pregnant women.&#13;
Morbidity and Mortality. Children in villages with health care had&#13;
shorter episodes of illness for conditions such as cough, fever, diarrhea and&#13;
eye infection. Combined health and nutrition services produced a significant&#13;
reduction in the duration of eye infections (further reduction of one day).&#13;
Medical care villages had a perinatal mortality rate (stillbirth and 1-7 days)&#13;
that was about 20 percent lower.&#13;
Other findings include the following:&#13;
O    Neonatal mortality (0 to 30 days) was reduced 40 percent in&#13;
groups provided with health or nutrition care.&#13;
O    Postneonatal mortality (1 to 12 months) was reduced 50 percent in&#13;
bealth care villages but only 7 percent in nutrition care villages.&#13;
O    Mortality of children aged 1-3 was reduced about 40 percent&#13;
in all villages receiving services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
Cost. Nutrition care was the most expensive service ($2.00 a year);&#13;
medical care cost less than half that. The cost of deaths averted varied with&#13;
the age of the child. Cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that the cost of&#13;
prenatal child care per perinatal death averted was lowest in nutrition vil-&#13;
lages; the cost per infant death averted was lowest in health care villages,&#13;
as was the cost per child death averted. The findings show that nutrition&#13;
care was more efficient in promoting physical growth, health care in reducing&#13;
morbidity.&#13;

NARANGWAL POPULATION PROJECT&#13;
The population project in Narangwal (1968-74) was a major research project&#13;
conducted in conjunction with the Nutrition Study in Punjab. It was, we&#13;
believe, the first controlled field experiment prospectively to measure&#13;
combinations of health and family planning services against family planning&#13;
acceptance. The combined nutrition and health care villages in the nutrition&#13;
study were also the child care and family planning group of villages for this&#13;
study. The Indian Council of Medical Research, working with the Johns Hopkins&#13;
University School of Hygiene and Public Health, was responsible for the&#13;
project. The U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, U.S. Agency&#13;
for International Development, the Indian Council of Medical Research, and the&#13;
World Health Organization provided funding.&#13;
Design and Objectives&#13;
The main objectives of the study were to measure the effects of&#13;
different packages of services on attitudes toward family planning and on its&#13;
practice--to show what measurable effect each service has on practice. The&#13;
nineteen experimental villages had a population of about 27,100; one group of&#13;
villages served as a control for the experiment. Each group of experimental&#13;
villages was provided with a different service package. Information was&#13;
collected by cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Longitudinal data&#13;
included vital statistics, morbidity, anthropometric data, family planning&#13;
practice, and fertility. Socioeconomic studies were conducted and cross-&#13;
sectional data were collected on the knowledge and practice of family plan-&#13;
ning and on attitudes and beliefs about child survival and family planning.&#13;
The use and cost of health services were also measured.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Services&#13;
The different packages of services were as follows:&#13;
o     FPED -- family planning and family planning education only.&#13;
o     FPWS -- family planning and women's services.&#13;
o     FPCC -- family planning and child care services.&#13;
o     FPWSCC -- family planning, women's services, and child care.&#13;
O     CONTROL -- no services.&#13;
Women's services included prenatal and postnatal care, early identifica-&#13;
tion of pregnancy, and treatment or referral for illness. Child care services&#13;
included nutrition and infectious disease control. Family planning services&#13;
included education, motivation, and contraceptive services with follow-up.&#13;
The group of villages receiving family planning and child care services (FPCC)&#13;
was also part of the parallel nutrition project.&#13;
Findings&#13;
Because the project ended earlier than expected, changes in fertility&#13;
could not be shown in the experimental groups. Originally the project was&#13;
to continue until the curves for family planning practice had plateaued in&#13;
the experimental groups. But services were ended in one group after two years&#13;
and in another after three years. In addition, the service packages were not&#13;
introduced at the same time. Although the project was designed to show both&#13;
an increase in contraceptive practices and a significant decline in fertility,&#13;
the short duration of the project limited evaluation to output measures. At&#13;
the end of the project, the curves for family planning practice were still&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
rising. Significant differences in fertility in the experimental groups could&#13;
not be shown. The main indicator of program performance was the number of&#13;
people who accepted family planning during the program s life, excluding&#13;
previous family planning acceptors using modern methods of contraception.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Several variables--such as caste, income, and land ownership--also&#13;
influenced family planning practice, but their influence was shown to be&#13;
less important than previous use of family planning or of health services.&#13;
One significant variable was the number of children a couple had lost: child&#13;
deaths had a strong influence on family planning acceptance. Integrated&#13;
services for health, nutrition, and family planning were the most cost-&#13;
effective.&#13;
ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES IN FAMILY PLANNING, BANGALORE&#13;
The Population Center in Bangalore did an experimental study (1974-79) of five&#13;
"alternative" strategies in an area covered by the ongoing India Population&#13;
Project.&#13;
Design and Objectives&#13;
The experiment was to test the appropriateness of changes in the&#13;
family planning program and to find ways of improving the program's efficiency&#13;
and effectiveness. The implementation for each strategy was also studied to&#13;
provide better ideas about that for the entire program. Each of five strategies&#13;
was introduced at selected groups of primary health centers in Bangalore&#13;
in 1976. The five strategies were:&#13;
o    Involving a voluntary agency in family welfare programs at primary&#13;
health centers.&#13;
o    Applying management principles at primary health centers, including&#13;
those for planning, supervision, training, and coordination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
o    Improving the technical competence of health service personnel.&#13;
O    Entrusting responsibility for family welfare targets to nonhealth&#13;
departments: that is, to Panchayat chairmen, village accountants,&#13;
and other village level workers.&#13;
o    Using incentives in kind at the primary health centers.&#13;
The strategies were adopted in ten primary health centers in five districts;&#13;
five other centers, one from each district, were controls. Performance was&#13;
estimated from survey data for 1968-69 to 1973-74, and centers were ranked as&#13;
high, medium, and low in performance. As far as possible, each strategy was&#13;
tested in a high and low performance center.&#13;
The performance of each primary health center was evaluated on the&#13;
basis of six criteria:&#13;
o    Number of sterilizations and sterilization equivalents during the&#13;
financial year.&#13;
o    Registered prenatal and postnatal cases and number of deliveries by&#13;
qualified personnel.&#13;
o    Input-output analysis.&#13;
O    Changes in average open birth interval.&#13;
O    Opinions of personnel involved directly or indirectly in the program.&#13;
O    Changes in fertility and attitudes measured by a longitudinal&#13;
sample survey.&#13;
The Population Center collected data each month and conducted surveys between&#13;
1975 and 1978 to provide information on sterilization and MCH activities,&#13;
on the knowledge, attitude, and practice of family planning (KAP), and on&#13;
fertility indexes. Used in evaluating the alternative strategies were the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
sterilization equivalent rate, the maternal-and-child health equivalent rate,&#13;
the staff efficiency index, and the KAP measurement. There were two evalua-&#13;
tions: one in 1974-75, before implementation of the alternative strategies,&#13;
and one from 1977-79, after implementation of the strategies.&#13;
Findings&#13;
Although recognizing the difficulties in developing a true experi-&#13;
ment in family planning, the authors suggest that the study, in addition to&#13;
providing some answers to questions raised in the experiment, has brought to&#13;
light many new issues and field problems. The findings suggest that involve-&#13;
ment of a voluntary agency in the administration of a primary health center,&#13;
produces substantial results in achieving targets for family planning and&#13;
maternal and child health. Conversely, a partnership with the government&#13;
in undertaking a joint effort to achieve targets was not successful. Primary&#13;
reasons for this included lack of coordination, poor demarcation of roles and&#13;
responsibility and a feeling of alienation. Management principles did not&#13;
have a significant effect on family planning, but the improved technical abil-&#13;
ities of staff members yielded significant results. The project emphasized&#13;
family planning services more than maternal-and-child health (MCH) services,&#13;
and that affected MCH performance.&#13;
Having village-level functionaries responsible for the motivational&#13;
aspects of the program and health staff responsible for provision of services&#13;
did not make a difference in performance of family planning or MCH activities.&#13;
Misunderstandings about the role of these functionaries vis-a-vis health per-&#13;
sonnel and a conflict between their normal role in the village were the most&#13;
important problems encountered. The role for such groups would be to create&#13;
awareness of and demand for family planning services. The use of incentives&#13;
in kind at primary health centers had mixed results. The use of family&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

planning and MCH services improved under this strategy, but there were many&#13;
problems with the incentives, including an adverse effect on the credibility&#13;
of workers.&#13;
There was no economic analysis of the various strategies.&#13;
MANDWA RURAL HEALTH RESEARCH PROJ]ECT, MAHARASHTRA&#13;
The Mandwa Rural Health Research Project (1973- ) was started when the Depart-&#13;
ment of Health agreed to give control of a primary health unit to the Founda-&#13;
tion for Research in Community Health, which is part of Grant Medical College&#13;
in Bombay. An ongoing experimental project, MaLndwa covers 30,000 people in&#13;
twenty-nine villages in a rural area of the Konkan coast in Maharashtra. OXFAM&#13;
provides financing for the project along with other international donors and&#13;
the state government.&#13;
Design and Services&#13;
From the outset the project has been strongly committed to local&#13;
community involvement by forming local health committees to assist health&#13;
workers in preventive and promotive health work. Partial payment of the&#13;
health workers salaries and of charges for medicines has also been part of&#13;
the scheme. Mandwa provides integrated health services to the community and&#13;
is involved in leprosy and tuberculosis control. The Foundation, which acts&#13;
as the administrative agency, provided staff to run the project and trained&#13;
twenty-six women, chosen by the communities, to undertake simple curative pro-&#13;
cedures and preventive work. An auxiliary nurse-midwife provides support for&#13;
five village health workers and covers a population of 5,000. A doctor visits&#13;
each of the six subcenters once a week to advise on more difficult cases and&#13;
provide staff support and training. In the first stages of the project, hos-&#13;
pital facilities were provided in response to the need communities expressed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Results&#13;
The experience of the Mandwa project has been mixed, and several&#13;
changes have been implemented. Although the project encouraged the participa-&#13;
tion of communities, local health committees have lost interest and stopped&#13;
functioning. These committees were mainly constituted by the vocal village&#13;
members who control the village and its activities. The project's main&#13;
emphasis has been on providing simple curative and preventive services, not&#13;
the more sophisticated services these committees expected. The project&#13;
director has highlighted two other problems. First, the involvement of&#13;
highly trained professionals in the early period was counterproductive&#13;
because rapid change was not in keeping with the pace of life in villages.&#13;
Second, coordination between government health staff and the project-s staff&#13;
has been limited--and it is believed that this has adversely affected the&#13;
project.&#13;
Even so, the results reported by the project are noteworthy (see&#13;
table A.3). Project costs per capita are estimated at $0.60 (Rs 4.50) a&#13;
year.&#13;
INTEGRATED HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT, KASA&#13;
The Kasa project (1974-77) was a pilot study in an area served by a primary&#13;
health center. About 125 miles north of Bombay in Maharashtra, the project&#13;
area covered about 56,000 people, of whom 88 percent were tribal. In 1974&#13;
the government handed over the control of personnel, financial resources,&#13;
and local health facilities to the Institute of Child Health in Bombay.&#13;
On completion of the project in 1977, the primary health center functions&#13;

reverted to the Department of Health. The project was paid for by the gov-&#13;
ernment of India, the government of Maharashtra, and CARE; it was administered&#13;
by the Institute of Child Health at Grant Medical College in Bombay.&#13;
Objectives and Design&#13;
The goal was to develop effective and efficient integrated health&#13;
and nutrition services for replication in rural Maharashtra. The objectives&#13;
included providing integrated maternal-and-child care to all preschoolers and&#13;
pregnant and nursing mothers in each village; providing care through part-time&#13;
social workers and medical and paramedical staff; encouraging community par-&#13;
ticipation; and evaluating the cost and effectiveness of the project. Targets&#13;
were set and groups "at risk" were identified by such criteria as birth weight&#13;
of less than 1.5 kilograms, and no weight gain in three consecutive months.&#13;
Similarly criteria were set for selecting pregnant women at risk.&#13;
The under-five (Morley) weight chart and an observation chart for&#13;
mothers were used to monitor changes. No control groups were used; evaluation&#13;
was based on before-and-after assessments of conditions among the target&#13;
groups. Surveillance was done by maintaining a longitudinal record for each&#13;
child, and the built-in evaluation system provided up-to-date information on&#13;
project activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
Services&#13;
The phased introduction of services avoided overloading the health&#13;
workers and was believed to be more acceptable to the community. For example,&#13;
to avoid suspicion and resistance, the project initiated its immunization&#13;
program several months after the project started. Birth control practices&#13;
were introduced in a similar way and at an appropriate time for the woman:&#13;
after a birth, for women with many children and for women more susceptible&#13;
to pregnancy, that is, one year after the last birth. The project provided&#13;
clinic-based services.&#13;
The project had many part-time social workers who visited homes,&#13;
maintained records, registered target group memlbers, provided supplementary&#13;
food, and conducted educational classes. Doctors and multipurpose workers&#13;
provided support and supervision. One voluntary worker covered about 2,000&#13;
people.&#13;
Findings&#13;
Data for the Kasa project are limited, and costs of project inputs&#13;
were not estimated accurately. Such items as donated food and labor were not&#13;
included in the financial analysis, but rough etstimates show a cost per capita&#13;
of about ($0.93) (Rs 7) a'year for the services. There were 45 sterilizations&#13;
in 1974-75, 1,668 in 1976-77. Reports also show, after eighteen months of&#13;
supplementary feeding, that 62.9 percent of severely malnourished children&#13;
improved their weight by 10 percent more than the expected growth. Table A.4&#13;
shows the better coverage by immunizations between June 1975 and May 1976.&#13;
The success recorded by the project may be related to factors independent of&#13;
the project, because there are no figures for a control group.&#13;

PROJECT POSHAK&#13;
In the early 1970s supplementary feeding programs in India were attracting&#13;
older preschool children but were not reaching the most vulnerable groups.&#13;
Project Poshak (1971-75) was a pilot project in Madhya Pradesh to meet the&#13;
nutritional needs of hutbound infants and toddlers aged six months to thirty-&#13;
six months. The project was designed to reach preschoolers not benefiting&#13;
from the on-site feeding. The nutrition program was linked to the health care&#13;
structure so that target groups would also benefit from preventive and promo-&#13;
tive health services.&#13;
Many agencies were involved in the funiding and management of Project&#13;
Poshak, but CARE played the major role in administering and evaluating it.&#13;
If the project were successful and if the take-home supplement proved effective&#13;
and efficient, the model was to become a permanent part of the state's nutri-&#13;
tion program.&#13;
Design and Objectives&#13;
The pilot project, an integrated health and nutrition plan, was&#13;
designed to test and evaluate the feasibility, efficiency, and impact of a&#13;
large supplementary feeding program covering a widely dispersed population.&#13;
Because it was conducted in backward tribal areas, it was believed that the&#13;
project, if successful in meeting its objectives, could be easily replicated&#13;
in better-off states. The project was to work through the health care sys-&#13;
tem, not through new services, so that replicatLon would also be feasible in&#13;
view of the manpower and financial constraints. There were three phases:&#13;
exploratory, extensive, and intensive. The main objective of the study was to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
test the feasibility of providing a "take-home" ration rather than an on-site&#13;
feeding ration to improve nutrition among preschool children. The effect of&#13;
services on the experimental group was measured longitudinally against a small&#13;
control group; population coverage and the effectiveness and efficiency of&#13;
services were also measured.&#13;
Services&#13;
The project provided, through the primary health centers and sub-&#13;
centers, medical and health care services with village immunization and&#13;
deworming services. Pregnant and lactating mothers received education and&#13;
demonstrations on child care. A take-home supplementary food ration was&#13;
distributed at the health care center, usually weekly. This allowed mothers&#13;
to provide regular amounts of the supplement to their children and avoided&#13;
daily trips to the feeding center. The project reached 15,000 beneficiaries&#13;
during its four years of operation.&#13;
Findings&#13;
In the extensive phase of the project, the cost per child was&#13;
$15.26 (Rs 114.46) a year at subcenters and $14.67 (Rs 110.06) a year at&#13;
primary health centers. The annual cost per child in the exploratory and&#13;
intensive phases was much higher. The figures show that the take-home&#13;
rations were less expensive than on-site feeding. Pyle (1976) has suggested&#13;
that "the two most important factors in determining the value of the Poshak&#13;
concept--cost and effectiveness--were neither strongly positive nor negative."&#13;
Records of health-related inputs were scanty for some areas, and it&#13;
was impossible to trace inputs and their use by target groups. Mortality&#13;
rates for treatment children, when matched against controls, were not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
significantly different. The effect of combined services was assessed in a&#13;
final weight measurement of a subsample of 688 experimental children compared&#13;
with age-matched controls. Differences were not significant. Improvements&#13;
in weight status- among children with second-degree and third-degree malnu-&#13;
trition were substantial during the intensive phase of the project but poor&#13;
during the extensive and exploratory stages.&#13;
A substudy comparing take-home and on-site feeding was conducted&#13;
during the intensive phase of the project. Findings from that study showed&#13;
participation rates to be much higher in the on-site scheme: they were 43&#13;
percent to 53 percent for the take-home ration, compared with 60 percent or&#13;
more for on-site feeding. The main target group, toddlers and preschool&#13;
children (six to thirty-six months) of landless laboring families, did not&#13;
participate to the extent expected. The small landowner class benefited most.&#13;
The effect of services in the extensive phase on the control and experimental&#13;
groups, was not substantially different. Several spillover effects were&#13;
identified among the experimental groups, however, including more use of&#13;
services at the primary health center, more acceptance of family planning&#13;
measures, and better attitudes of mothers toward health and nutrition.&#13;
INTEGRATED HEALTH SERVICE PROJECT, MIRAJ&#13;
The Miraj Integrated Health Service Project (1973-77) was jointly run by the&#13;
Government of Maharashtra and the Miraj Medical Center. The Department of&#13;
Health gave the voluntary agency full responsibility for administration based&#13;
at a primary health center. After the completion of the project in 1977,&#13;
responsibility for service activities reverted to the previous administration.&#13;
The World Council of Churches, the government of Maharashtra,&#13;
and Miraj Medical Centre provided funding for the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
Design and Objectives&#13;
The objectives included the provision of primary health care ser-&#13;
vices, family planning, and special programs of leprosy and tuberculosis&#13;
control. Training was emphasized: the project trained 173 of the 186 tradi-&#13;
tional midwives in the project area; a short orientation course with emphasis&#13;
on practical skills was held for (voluntary) village health aides, close to&#13;
their village. Community participation was encouraged: the community was&#13;
expected to pay a flat fee of $0.03 (Rs 0.25) for any medication received for&#13;
three-day treatments. Involvement of local village organizations was not&#13;
stressed, though project leaders worked with the gram panchayats. Health&#13;
services were introduced sequentially. As these became more acceptable, and&#13;
as the health workers established a relationship with the community, family&#13;
planning services were introduced. Population coverage was about 230,000.&#13;
The project employed a demographer, who processed and analyzed data on vital&#13;
statistics and on the coverage of services.&#13;
Services&#13;
The health workers made house-to-house calls in the villages and&#13;
carried a basic medicine kit containing vaccines, medicines, contraceptive&#13;
devices, some audio-visual aids, and a delivery kit. They also collected&#13;
vital statistics and taught mothers how to prepare oral rehydration fluids&#13;
for the treatment of childhood diarrhea. They were supervised and given&#13;
guidance by the health team, and intermediate workers usually visited the&#13;
village once a week.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
Findings&#13;
Data on the effect of services, particularly in relation to project&#13;
costs, are approximations. The per capita cost of the Miraj project was esti-,&#13;
mated to be $0.49 ( 3.70) a year. Because the project charged for medicines,&#13;
$2,650 (Rs 20,000) were recovered, and the project set up a revolving fund to&#13;
buy medicines. This more than doubled the allocation for medicines at the&#13;
primary health centers.&#13;
One indication of effectiveness of the project is the infant morta-&#13;
lity rate, which was reduced 66 percent in threie years. The project did not&#13;
have a control group, but infant mortality rates and output data are available&#13;
for coverage of services during the three years. Table A.5 provides project&#13;
results and achievements.&#13;

INDO-DUTCH PROJECT FOR CHILD WELFARE&#13;
The Indo-Dutch Project for Child Welfare (1969-) started as a pilot project&#13;
in Andhra Pradesh. It was designed to test and develop better methods of&#13;
care for children under sixteen, and to combine these services with a research&#13;
and training component. The project was to be a model for replication else-&#13;
where in the state. The project donors expected to complete the pilot project&#13;
in eight years and then to withdraw. It was intended that the project would&#13;
become self-sustaining with increased community participation and eventually&#13;
become a community project. It is now expected that donors will continue with&#13;
the project until 1985. Fourteen villages in Chevella Block in the Ranga&#13;
Reddy district of Andhra Pradesh are covered by the project. It was devel-&#13;
oped through the collaboration of the Indian government and the Netherlands&#13;
Foundation.&#13;
Design and Objectives&#13;
The main objectives are to provide health, nutrition, and educational&#13;
facilities for children up to sixteen. In addition, the nutrition component&#13;
is linked with income-generating activities. The health component has changed&#13;
over the years to develop the most appropriate type of service for communities.&#13;
Auxiliary nurse midwives, each covering a population of 5,000 in the project&#13;
area, supervise and support community health volunteers (gram swastikas). A&#13;
mobile health team visits villages twice a week to monitor and supervise the&#13;
work of auxiliary nurse midwives and to immunize eligible children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Services&#13;
The community health volunteer covers about 200 families and pro-&#13;
vides basic health care to mothers and children in the population. Scabies,&#13;
worms, and diarrheas are treated; surveillance is maintained for children&#13;
under five; prenatal and postnatal cases are supervised and pregnant women&#13;
are referred for special care to the auxiliary nurse midwife. The community&#13;
health volunteer has a monthly stipend of $6.70 (Rs 50) and families are&#13;
expected to pay $0.06 (50 paise) a month toward her salary. In effect, many&#13;
families do not pay this sum, and community involvement is not apparent.&#13;
Creches and income-generating schemes, such as preparing ground spices and&#13;
making up packets of protein foods for the nutriLtion project, were also&#13;
started. Family planning services are available for interested couples.&#13;
Findings&#13;
In 1977 the National Institute of Rural Development in Hyderabad&#13;
completed a study of the project's impact in the Chevella block. The survey,&#13;
conducted primarily among female beneficiaries of the program, produced&#13;
mixed results. The immunization program had widespread acceptance in an area&#13;
where immunizations had not previously been undertaken. It was also found&#13;
that infant mortality rates dropped and that health services were more acces-&#13;
sible to the population. But the study did not find any major change in&#13;
community attitudes and practices or in the adoption of income-generating&#13;
activities beneficial to the families. The local women-s groups (mahila&#13;
mandals) were not as effective as expected in iLnvolving and reaching local&#13;
women, despite an expenditure of $12,800 (Rs 96,000) to strengthen these&#13;
women s groups. Loans to encourage income-generating activities have not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
been recovered. One of the major omissions was the absence of community&#13;
involvement in determining needs and appropriate responses. Only in 1973,&#13;
five years after the project-s initiation, were the communities asked to&#13;
contribute to the various activities of the project. Detailed survey findings&#13;
are not available to assess the effect of the project, but figures on service&#13;
coverage are shown in table A.6.&#13;

NO-BIRTH BONUS SCHEME, SOUTH INDIA&#13;
The United Planters Association of Southern India (UPASI), with the support of&#13;
USAID, introduced monetary incentives to encourage couples to adopt family&#13;
planning. The incentive was a deferred payment to couples who limited their&#13;
family size. Called the No-Birth Bonus Scheme (1971-), it was started on&#13;
three tea estates in South India and of first was open to all permanent&#13;
female employees between seventeen and forty. On the tea estates, legislation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
requires that all permanent employees be provided with housing, health&#13;
services, and such benefits as pensions and maternity and child care benefits.&#13;
Design and Objectives&#13;
The No-Birth Bonus Scheme -- part of the larger Comprehensive&#13;
Labor Welfare Scheme -- was intended to test nontraditional incentives&#13;
to limiting family size. It was designed to overcome some of the problems&#13;
with more immediate incentives in family planning and to encourage couples to&#13;
adopt family planning by giving them the freedom to choose between different&#13;
contraceptive methods.&#13;
Each female estate worker of childbearing age who accepted the&#13;
plan was provided with a joint savings account in her name and the company&#13;
name. For each month that she did not become pregnant, $0.67 (Rs 5) would&#13;
be deposited in the account, which would be frozen until she passed the&#13;
childbearing period, when she could withdraw the savings. In the interim,&#13;
she would earn interest on the deposit. If she became pregnant, however,&#13;
a certain amount would be forfeited or payments stopped for a year.&#13;
Services&#13;
Under the larger welfare scheme operating on all three tea estates,&#13;
a maternity and child welfare program provide immunizations, supplementary&#13;
nutrition care, prenatal and postnatal services, and recreational and educa-&#13;
tional facilities. Family planning services are free. If a couple decided&#13;
to be sterilized, the large cash incentive provided by the government would&#13;
accrue in addition to the deferred incentive offered by the bonus scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
In the first year of the plan, 480 of 792 eligible women joined. In the&#13;
second year, 116 eligible women enrolled, but since then the rolls for&#13;
membership have remained closed, and the numbers are gradually reducing.&#13;
A few women have migrated or died, and a few have forfeited membership.&#13;
In 1977 there were 521 members.&#13;
Findings&#13;
In 1975 a sample survey was conducted on eighteen tea estates.&#13;
More information, obtained from official records of births and from personal&#13;
observations, has helped in assessing the effect and shortcomings of the&#13;
scheme. There were three groups of estates: the first comprised the three&#13;
tea estates that had the No-Birth Bonus Scheme (Type 1); the second, nine&#13;
estates that had only the Comprehensive Labor Welfare Scheme (Type II); the&#13;
third, six estates that had neither scheme and were used as controls (Type&#13;
III). Crude birth rates, available from company records up to 1977, were&#13;
selected to ensure more accuracy in the data analysis. Table A.7 presents&#13;
the crude birth rates for the three types of tea estate and for other areas.&#13;
The measurements suggest that the biggest effect was on women in&#13;
their thirties and on couples who had three or four children. Of the eligible&#13;
women in the three estates chosen for the bonus scheme, 82 percent joined&#13;
during the two years that enrollment was open. Although birth and fertility&#13;
rates appeared to be falling faster on those estates than on the other two&#13;
groups, further data and analysis would be necessary to test the size and&#13;
significance of the decline. Furthermore, several administrative shortcomings&#13;
were identified in the plan, which may have contributed to a slower decline in&#13;
birth and fertility rates. The evaluation study does not provide a financial&#13;
analysis of the project.&#13;

COMPREHENSIVE RURAL HEALTH PROJECT, JAMKHED&#13;
Jamkhed, in Ahmednagar District, is one of the poorest areas of Maharashtra.&#13;
When the service-oriented health project started there (1971-), it covered&#13;
an area around the town and used Jamkhed as a base for its activities.&#13;
Population coverage after the first year was about 40,000; by 1978 it was&#13;
100,000. The project leaders, recognizing the need for comprehensive health&#13;
services with fullest community participation, approached village leaders and&#13;
received an enthusiastic response to their suggestions for a comprehensive set&#13;
of health and nutrition services for the area. Funding is provided by the&#13;
Christian Medical Commission and various secular and religious agencies, but&#13;
the project has become increasingly self-sufficient. Studies before the start&#13;
of the project showed a high rate of infant mortality in the area--from 80 per&#13;
1,000 live births in Jamkhed town to 150 in the more rural areas.&#13;
Objectives and Design&#13;
The main project goals include reducing mortality and morbidity&#13;
rates, reducing population growth rates by gradually introducing family&#13;
planning services, and caring for the chronically ill and controlling leprosy&#13;
and tuberculosis. The project is designed to ensure full participation by the&#13;
community: the project directors must be assured of local support before the&#13;
village health team starts to work in a village. The village health team also&#13;
collects data and identifies target groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
Services&#13;
Project services include immunizations,, supplementary nutritional&#13;
care, care for children under five, family planning and maternal care, and&#13;
a program to control leprosy and tuberculosis. A central clinic provides&#13;
more sophisticated medical care, with an outpatient clinic, operating room,&#13;
and facilities for thirty patients. Curative services are provided to respond&#13;
to the expressed need of the community and to make the preventive and promo-&#13;
tional aspects of the program more acceptable. Fee-for-service payments are&#13;
made for curative services, but not for preventive measures. Mobile teams&#13;
visit the villages and, with village health workers, are responsible for&#13;
identifying and following up pregnant women and family planning acceptors.&#13;
The teams and village health workers also supervise home births, run a supple-&#13;
mentary feeding program, do surveillance of children under five, collect vital&#13;
statistics, and provide basic health care and education. They refer serious&#13;
cases to the center at Jamkhed or the hospital at Ahmednagar.&#13;
Findings&#13;
The Jaxkhed project has emphasized community participation and&#13;
responsibility. As a result, 75 percent of the recurrent expenses for the&#13;
project are met by patient fees. The government provides 4 percent of the&#13;
budget, foreign donations the rest. Curative services account for 30 percent&#13;
of the budget, preventive services for 60 percent, and administration for the&#13;
remaining 10 percent. The communities have donated land, contributed building&#13;
materials, and provided labor. In 1979 the per capita cost for care was&#13;
estimated at $1.17 (Rs 8.75) a year.&#13;

Table A.8 presents the findings of surveys of the target population&#13;
in 1971 and in 1976. Note the marked differences in mortality rates and&#13;
service coverage between project and nonproject areas. Further analysis of&#13;
the data is needed, however, because there were no strict controls to assess&#13;
the effect of project measures.&#13;

APPLIED NUTRITION PROGRAM, KERALA&#13;
Kerala is one of the poorest states in India, and with Bihar, Gujarat, and&#13;
Tamil Nadu it has a high incidence of calorie-deficient diets. These defi-&#13;
ciencies particularly affect the vulnerable groups--the young, pregnant women,&#13;
and lactating mothers. In 1950 the FAO, UNICEF, other international organiza-&#13;
tions, and the government of India started a program of supplementary feeding&#13;
for children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers. This program was later&#13;
expanded to encourage village food production and to educate families about&#13;
nutritional needs and ways of meeting those needs. In 1963 the government&#13;
of India signed an agreement with the international agencies to extend the&#13;
program to the whole country.&#13;
In 1963-64 the program started in Kerala, and in 1978 it was oper-&#13;
ating in eighty-one of the state's 144 community development blocks. Several&#13;
agencies and government departments have been involved in the project. The&#13;
government of India, UNICEF, and CARE provide support and assistance for the&#13;
successful implementation of the program; the central government's Department&#13;
of Community Development has been responsible for coordination.&#13;
Objectives and Design&#13;
The program is mainly educational and its major objective is to&#13;
improve the nutritional status of preschool children, pregnant women, and&#13;
nursing mothers. The program has four main components:&#13;
o    Nutrition, health education, and training.&#13;
o    Production of protective and protein foods in&#13;
school, home, and community gardens.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
o    Demonstration feeding.&#13;
O    Scheduled health check-ups and immunizations.&#13;
Each component is designed to encourage greater participation by the communi-&#13;
ties in obtaining nutritious diets. Education and training are emphasized to&#13;
create more awareness of nutritional needs and to encourage dietary changes&#13;
beneficial to the vulnerable groups.&#13;
Program Services&#13;
Nutrition education has been provided at day-long women's camps:&#13;
during 1976-77 about 75,000 women attended in these camps. Teaching sessions&#13;
emphasized hygiene, food preservation, cooking without losing nutrients, and&#13;
the general importance of nutrition. In addition, discussions of similar&#13;
topics were held in 30,000 informal groups during that year.&#13;
The production component encourages activities in horticulture,&#13;
poultry keeping, and fisheries, as well as the development of vegetable gar-&#13;
dens for demonstration purposes. The feeding program of the state's 3,000&#13;
feeding centers for preschoolers and for pregnant and lactating women benefits&#13;
300,000 people.&#13;
During the first stages of the program, services were provided only&#13;
in blocks where they could be tied to a training institution. Such blocks&#13;
would serve both as a field-training area for trainees and as a demonstration&#13;
area with ongoing field extension programs. Later, as personnel were trained,&#13;
the program was extended to blocks not served by training institutions. Pri-&#13;
mary health centers work with the program by providing immunizations, selecting&#13;
beneficiaries for the feeding centers, and performing medical checks of mal-&#13;
nourished children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
Findings&#13;
In 1975 the State Planning Board, at the government's request,&#13;
evaluated the impact and achievements of the program. It conducted a survey&#13;
in a random sample of eleven of the seventy-four community development blocks&#13;
then in existence. Only blocks that had the program for three or more years&#13;
were included. A control group was selected with characteristics similar to&#13;
the blocks in the sample. Schedules of information about the program were&#13;
collected by observation and in household questionnaires, and these were&#13;
supplemented by official data from state records.&#13;
More than a quarter of the centers did not have the intended number&#13;
of beneficiaries. Furthermore, in half the centers the number of pregnant and&#13;
lactating women was far lower than intended. Miny believe that low-income&#13;
families in the community are not aware of the program and therefore are not&#13;
selected as beneficiaries. In three-quarters of the centers studied, the&#13;
medical officer was not involved in the selection of beneficiaries. Field&#13;
investigations revealed a deficit between registration and attendance of 30&#13;
to 40 percent. The picture for home, school, and community garden projects&#13;
and production programs was similar. It was apparent that facilities were&#13;
underused and that materials essential for implementation of the plan were&#13;
lacking.&#13;
There was not a full complement of staff, and many extension&#13;
officers involved did not have formal training in the program. According&#13;
to the evaluation, implementation was poor and results were unsatisfactory&#13;
because of the limited involvement of government departments and because of&#13;
the lack of interest of panchayats, local bodies, and the community. The&#13;
nutritional impact of services on beneficiaries in the feeding program was&#13;
not reported.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

SPECIAL NUTRITION PROGRAM, COIMBATORE, TAMIL NADU&#13;
The government of India launched the Special Nutrition Program (1970-) with'&#13;
the objective of providing supplementary nutrition to preschool children,&#13;
pregnant women, and nursing mothers of low-income groups in urban slums and in&#13;
tribal and backward rural areas. The national program is under the Department&#13;
of Social Welfare; the state program under the Director of Social Welfare, of&#13;
Tribal Development, or of Rural Development. The block development officer&#13;
and his staff are responsible for the day-to-day working of the block program.&#13;
Food is provided by CARE, the World Food Program, and the states. The scheme&#13;
has more than 6 million beneficiaries in the country.&#13;
During 1970-75, the Special Nutrition Program in Tamil Nadu reached&#13;
80,000 children in 280 feeding centers. The program was started in Coimbatore&#13;
in 1971, and by the end of that year 7,000 children were receiving supplemen-&#13;
tary nutrition care at eighteen centers in the city.&#13;
Objectives and Services&#13;
The program combats the urgent nutritional problem, especially&#13;
among children. Low-income urban communities and rural and tribal families&#13;
are the main target groups. Countrywide surveys had shown that up to 80&#13;
percent of preschool children are suffering from varying degrees of malnutri-&#13;
tion in India. The program, a feeding-only program that daily supplies&#13;
children with three slices of fortified sweetened milk bread weighing 75&#13;
grams, reaches the most vulnerable groups--mostly children aged six months to&#13;
thirty-six months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
Evaluation Studies&#13;
At the request of the state government, an evaluation team has done&#13;
several studies of the program-s impact. Five feeding centers catering to&#13;
about 2,500 children in Coimbatore city were chosen for the studies. A&#13;
dietary study using questionnaires and interviews was carried out among&#13;
the 240 families of the 308 children selected as a sample. Clinical and&#13;
anthropometric data were collected, as was background information on income,&#13;
family size, and the number of dependents in the household. Of the families&#13;
surveyed, 85 percent had incomes below $27 (Rs 200) a month. Only 30 percent&#13;
of the members of those families had some education; only 1 percent had more&#13;
than secondary education. More than 80 percent of the families spent more&#13;
than 60 percent of their income on food. Dietary intake, based on the Indian&#13;
Council of Medical Research allowances, was below recommended intake. There&#13;
were clinical signs of corneal vascularization and Bitot's spots for 36 per-&#13;
cent of the study children. The anthropometric data collected was compared&#13;
to values for all India and for Tamil Nadu. The study data show the weights&#13;
and heights of beneficiaries to be below those values at all ages (table&#13;
A.9).&#13;

Study 2. Five centers representative of the eighteen in Coimbatore&#13;
City were selected for study. Two were primary schools, two were maternal-and-?&#13;
child-health centers, and one was a nursery school. Measurements of weight&#13;
and height were recorded monthly for six months, and a physician conducted a&#13;
clinical survey before and after the study. Figures were compared for India,&#13;
for Tamil Nadu, and for Coimbatore.&#13;
Weights of children in Coimbatore were below those of the other&#13;
groups (table A.10). An improvement was observed in the clinical signs at&#13;
the end of the study. Growth trends among present beneficiaries was close&#13;
to the values for Tamil Nadu and all India, even though the study group was&#13;
of lower socioeconomic status.&#13;

Further findings in Coimbatore City. The same study team evaluated&#13;
the effectiveness of "take-home feeding" and "spot feeding" in two further&#13;
studies in Tamil Nadu. 1/ A control group was selected with the same socio-&#13;
economic background as children in the program. The findings show that the&#13;
mean increment in weight and height across the three groups was different:&#13;
the biggest weight increases were fqr spot-fed children. The difference in&#13;
hemoglobin levels of experimental groups and control group was also signifi-&#13;
cant. Clinical assessment indicated that the nutritional status of children&#13;
receiving supplements was better. The findings related to growth measurements&#13;
suggest substitution and leakage to nontarget family members among the take-&#13;
home group.&#13;
The second of these additional studies tested the effect of nutri-&#13;
tion education combined with supplementary feeding at a selected feeding&#13;
center; another center provided supplements only; a control group had neither&#13;
services provided. The knowledge mothers and children had about nutrition&#13;
markedly increased after nutrition education, and the choice of nutritious&#13;
foods improved.&#13;
SPECIAL NUTRITION PROGRAM, ANDHRA PRADESH&#13;
The Director of Tribal Welfare is responsible for the Special Nutrition Pro-&#13;
gram (1973- ) in Andhra Pradesh; the Block Development Officers and their&#13;
extension officers are responsible for its day-to-day supervision. Since&#13;
1973 the program has reached 140,000 beneficiaries. Food is provided by&#13;
CARE, the World Food Program, and the state government. Recipes based on&#13;
local foods are suggested by the National Institute of Nutrition and are&#13;

used as much as possible in feeding children. The objectives and main compo-&#13;
nents of the program in Andhra Pradesh are similar to those of the program in&#13;
Tamil Nadu.&#13;
Design and Objectives&#13;
The National Institute of Nutrition has evaluated the impact of the&#13;
supplementary feeding program on the nutritional status of participants to&#13;
determine what effect the supplement had on intake levels--and whether it&#13;
replaced home foods--and to evaluate operational and administrative bottle-&#13;
necks. A comparative study of supplemented and unsupplemented groups was&#13;
undertaken, after matching the control group with the program group on the&#13;
basis of socioeconomic status, communication facilities, educational and&#13;
medical facilities, and other characteristics. Fifty control villages and&#13;
fifty-one project villages were chosen in nine community development blocks&#13;
in six districts of the state. A dietary study was conducted by administering&#13;
questionnaires, and data were collected on the food consumed the previous day.&#13;
Weight and height measures were gathered for both groups classified into four&#13;
grades.&#13;
Findings&#13;
The cost of the supplement per child is about $0.02 (Rs 0.15) a day,&#13;
and the program, unlike those in other areas, is functioning all year, not the&#13;
300 days suggested. Mean attendance is 86 percent. The supplemented group&#13;
has a lower prevalence of deficiencies identified according to signs of&#13;
protein-calorie malnutrition, but vitamin-B deficiency generally is more&#13;
prevalent among supplemented children. The supplementary diet does not&#13;

contain extra amounts of these vitamins, and the home diet also lacks them.&#13;
The extra calories the supplement provides may in some way aggravate the&#13;
existing deficiency.&#13;
Supplemented children are taller and heavier than unsupplemented&#13;
children of the same tribal group (table A.ll). The percentage of children&#13;
classified as normal--that is, children whose body weights are equal to&#13;
or greater than 90 percent of the Indian averages--is greater for supple-&#13;
mented children than for unsupplemented children of the same tribal group&#13;
(table A.12). More children in the unsupplemented groups are suffering from&#13;
severe and moderate malnutrition. Differences in the nutritional status of&#13;
various tribes are attributable to differences in dietary habits at home.&#13;
The researchers suggest that the observed improvement in supple-&#13;
mented children, an indication of the project's success, can be traced to the&#13;
small number of operational and administrative problems. Important to the&#13;
project's success are the compactness of villages, the involvement of local&#13;
people as helpers, and the regular supply of materials given directly to the&#13;
organizers of the program.&#13;
MID-DAY MEALS PROGRAM, MADHYA PRADESH&#13;
The Mid-Day Meals Program (1965-) was launched in Madhya Pradesh as an emer-&#13;
gency relief measure in response to a drought. Having later become a regular&#13;
feature of the tribal school system in the state, it has two main objectives:&#13;
improving the nutritional status of school children, and encouraging regular&#13;
school attendance rates. The Tribal and Harijan Welfare Department has re-&#13;
sponsibility for organizing and implementing the program and for paying port&#13;

CARE monitors and evaluates the program, which gets some of its food through&#13;
U.S. food aid to India under Public Law 480. CARE provides 85 percent of the&#13;
raw materials, the government of India 15 percent, in local groundnuts, grain&#13;
flour, vitamins, and minerals.&#13;
Objectives and Services&#13;
The program is intended to reach older children, who still are&#13;
subject to high rates of malnutrition even though they have passed the most&#13;
vulnerable years. The effects of malnutrition on learning and on the devel-&#13;
opment of children are well understood. The program also has the objective of&#13;
increasing the enrollment and participation rates of children from disadvan-&#13;
taged homes. The provision of a free school meal is an incentive to parents&#13;
to send their child to school, a deterrent to high drop-out rates.&#13;
The program is administered at the local level by a nutrition&#13;
organizer and the school teachers. A daily ration of food providing more than&#13;
300 calories and 14 grams of protein is distributed to all school children&#13;
on all school days--and if possible on nonworking days as well, but this&#13;
depends on the local organization. The targeted number of feeding days in the&#13;
year is 180. Health and nutrition education aLnd preventive health care are&#13;
part of this program, but it has not been possible to implement them or to&#13;
provide the inputs needed.&#13;
Evaluation&#13;
At the request of the Tribal and Harijan Welfare Department, CARE&#13;
did a retrospective study of the effect of the program on the intended bene-&#13;
ficiaries. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
free school meal on nutritional levels of program participants, to measure the&#13;
program's effect on school attendance rates, and to determine food displace-&#13;
ment at home and the extent to which school meals supplement the home diet.&#13;
The study is of primary day schools in twenty-one districts of&#13;
Madhya Pradesh, though meals are also provided in boarding schools (ashrams)&#13;
and hostels for students. No baseline data were available, and measurement&#13;
is based on a comparative study of children who have "more exposure" to the&#13;
feeding program and those children who have "less exposure." (A strict con-&#13;
trol group was not available because the program extends to all accessible&#13;
tribal schools in the state.) The efficiency of feeding programs was measured&#13;
by examining feeding days in relation to school working days. Children who&#13;
attend schools with high program efficiency and who have greater exposure to&#13;
the program were compared with children who attend schools with low program&#13;
efficiency and who have less exposure to the program. The random sampling&#13;
was done in three stages: the "pay center" (storage point at block level)&#13;
formed the unit of sampling at the first stage; the schools and school chil-&#13;
dren formed the second and third stages respectively. Data were obtained from&#13;
several sources:&#13;
(1) A dietary survey, using twenty-four-hour recall,&#13;
was conducted among the mothers of a subsample&#13;
of the children.&#13;
(2) School records provided data on attendance, enrollment,&#13;
and feeding operations. Wastage and drop-out rates were&#13;
estimated from the records maintained at schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
(3) Anthropometric data were collected. Weight and height&#13;
were expressed as weight-for-age, height-for-age,&#13;
weight-for-height, and weight-for-height combined&#13;
with height-for-age.&#13;
(4) Interviews of the program organizer, school&#13;
children, and their mothers also provided data.&#13;
Findings&#13;
Effect on Nutritional Status. The Mid-Day Meals Program increases&#13;
the growth of school children. Children from high efficiency schools on&#13;
average are taller and heavier than children from low efficiency schools.&#13;
In addition, there is less second- and third-degree malnutrition in the&#13;
high efficiency schools, and the rates of wasting and stunting are lower.&#13;
Shortlidge (1980) suggests in his evaluation of the impact of the program&#13;
on nutritional status that the differences between high and low efficiency&#13;
schools in weight and height are not dramatic:&#13;
"The most persuasive evidence of a link between the Mid-&#13;
Day Meals program and health status was the regression analysis&#13;
explaining percent weight-for-height as a function of sex, family&#13;
type, land holding, education of mother, education of father, home&#13;
caloric intake, months of participation in the Mid-Day Meals Pro-&#13;
gram and program efficiency. In this equation, four variables&#13;
were found to significantly affect weight for height--family,&#13;
land holding, months of participation and program efficiency.&#13;
Of these four the two most important were months of participation&#13;
in the Mid-Day Meals Program and program efficiency" (p. 9).&#13;
Although the impact of these two variables is positive, it is not striking.&#13;
The figures in table A.13 show one index of nutritional status of children&#13;
from schools of different program efficiency.&#13;

Effect on School Attendance. The findings about school attendance&#13;
are inconclusive. Because no matching control group is in the study, it was&#13;
impossible to measure differences. Low-efficiency schools have proportionately&#13;
more upper-class children with better educated parents than the high efficiency&#13;
schools. Because socioeconomic levels often affect school attendance rates,&#13;
it can be concluded that the higher attendance rates of children in the low&#13;
efficiency schools is related to socioeconomic background, not to the mid-day&#13;
meal. The days present at school is positively related to the months present&#13;
in the school-feeding program.&#13;
Effects on Dietary Intake. The findings show that 20 percent of&#13;
the children in the program have their first meal of the day at school. The&#13;
differences in food intake are not significant between those who take a&#13;
school meal and those who do not. Children who take no school meal have some&#13;

"additional" food in the home. Findings from the study suggest that, in&#13;
schools of high program efficiency, the mid-day meal is a supplement to the&#13;
home diet. In schools with medium or low efficiency, a third of the calories&#13;
of the mid-day meal substitute for the home diet..&#13;

            Health, nutrition, and family planning in
            India : a survey of experiments and special projects
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The paper surveys fourteen experiments
            and special projects in health, nutrition, and family
            planning in India. They fall into three broad
            categories--research projects, pilot projects, and service
            projects. The paper makes the following conclusions: (i)
            integration makes a difference in the cost-effectiveness of
            services for health, nutrition, and family planning; (ii)
            community participation leads to better handling of health
            and welfare programs, better acceptance of health care
            services, and generally more equitable distribution of the
            benefits of services; (iii) paraprofessionals should deliver
            preventive and simple curative services and do promotional
            work; (iv) supervision and training systems are essential
            for the success of projects; (v) outreach and the targeting
            of services yield substantial benefits; (vi) the cost of
            services offered by special projects is fairly low but still
            higher than that of government services; and (vii) effective
            monitoring of the impact of services was not developed for
            any of the projects surveyed.
