            Palestinians are getting poorer on
            average for the third year in a row. As evidenced in
            previous World Bank reports, the competitiveness of the
            Palestinian economy has been progressively eroding since the
            signing of the Oslo accords, in particular its industry and
            agriculture. Even though donor aid had increased
            government-funded services and fueled consumption-driven
            growth during 2007 to 2011, this growth model has proved
            unsustainable. Donor support has significantly declined in
            recent years and, in any case, aid cannot sustainably make
            up for inadequate private investment. Thus, growth has
            started to slow since 2012 and the Palestinian economy
            contracted in 2014 following the Gaza war. In early 2015,
            GDP was still lower than it was a year ago. Due to
            population growth, real GDP per capita has been shrinking
            since 2013. Unemployment remains high, particularly amongst
            Gaza’s youth where it exceeds 60 percent, and 25 percent of
            Palestinians currently live in poverty. Against the backdrop
            of weak economic growth, reduced donor aid, and temporary
            suspension of revenue payments by the Government of Israel
            (GoI), the Palestinian Authority’s reform efforts have not
            been able to prevent another year with a financing gap. The
            persistence of this situation could potentially lead to
            political and social unrest. In short, the status quo is not
            sustainable and downside risks of further conflict and
            social unrest are high.
