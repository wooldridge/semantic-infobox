            Are the trends in low-income countries different?

            This note, based on the World
            Bank's Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI)
            project database, reviews trends in infrastructure projects
            with private participation in low-income countries. Four
            main conclusions arise. Surprisingly, the proportion of
            countries with at least one project - eighty one percent -
            is higher among low-income, than middle-income countries. As
            in middle-income countries, most investment has been in
            telecommunications, or energy projects. However, in
            low-income countries, well over half the projects are
            greenfield. And the scale of private participation in
            low-income countries, lags far behind that in middle-income countries.
