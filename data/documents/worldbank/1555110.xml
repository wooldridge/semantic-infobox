Staff Working Paper No. 326&#13;
April 1979&#13;
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DIMENSIONS OF TOURISM&#13;
Tourism is a viable path to economic development; but many developing&#13;
countries, by failing to plan, lose control over the development of tourism.&#13;
Failure to plan reduces the economic gains to the host country, results in&#13;
loss of local ownership and control of tourist facilities, and may lead to&#13;
additional adverse consequences (e.g., weakening of family ties, loss of&#13;
land by the local population). The World Bank has been slow to take into&#13;
account the social consequences of tourism; studies of tourism by sociolo-&#13;
gists themselves are relatively new, and many are unpublished. This paper,&#13;
therefore, recommends areas for further research by sociologists, recommends&#13;
steps the Bank can take to utilize the sociologists' perspective in tourism&#13;
projects, and offers insights (drawn from the literature and the author's&#13;
own experiences) into the social consequences of tourism and how to mitigate&#13;
the negative effects.&#13;

SUMMARY&#13;
i.        Tourism is a path to economic development; for some countries&#13;
it is the only viable path. But too few developing countries plan for tour-&#13;
ism. Countries that lack the financial, technical, or administrative capac-&#13;
ity to plan almost inevitably lose control over the development of tourism.&#13;
Foreign exchange earnings flow to the international hotel chains, airlines,&#13;
travel agencies, and marketing experts needed to attract the requisite num-&#13;
bers of tourists. Unforeseen consequences cause the relationship between&#13;
tourist and host country to sour. They include: loss of land by the local&#13;
population; weakening of family ties; and loss of local ownership and con-&#13;
trol of hotels, restaurants, and other tourist facilities.&#13;
ii.       The World Bank has been slow to take into account the social con-&#13;
sequences of tourism because the literature is relatively new and there is&#13;
no accepted methodology for evaluating the sociological consequences. Only&#13;
within the last decade have sociologists begun to turn their attention to&#13;
tourism. A significant percentage of studies on the subject are unpublished;&#13;
consequently, communication of research conclusions, even among sociologists,&#13;
is minimal.&#13;
iii.      The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to recommend areas for&#13;
further research by sociologists, recommend steps the Bank can take to uti-&#13;
lize the sociolpgist's perspective in tourism projects, and offer insights&#13;
into the social consequences of tourism and how to mitigate the negative&#13;
effects. The insights are drawn from the published and unpublished litera-&#13;
ture in English and from the author's own analysis and experiences.&#13;
iv.       Most of the adverse effects of tourism begin when tourism becomes&#13;
"institutionalized." Institutionalized tourists are those who travel on&#13;
packaged tours organized by specialized agencies (e.g., airlines, tour op-&#13;
erators) and do not, to any significant extent, give up their accustomed life&#13;
style while travelling. They constitute the majority of tourists and the&#13;
major potential source of foreign exchange from tourism. But they also demand&#13;
major adjustments and expenditures on the part of the host country. Tradi-&#13;
tionally, institutionalized tourism has required not only accommodating&#13;
increasing numbers of tourists, but also establishing Western style&#13;
hotels, travel agencies, and other familiar tourist trappings. For countries&#13;
without the capital or the expertise to establish their own such services&#13;
and facilities, institutionalization becomes the turning point where they&#13;
lose social, political, and economic control over tourism development.&#13;
v.         Developing and developed countries have successfully mitigated the&#13;
adverse effects of institutionalized tourism by:&#13;
(a) Coordinating the work of government agencies and administra-&#13;
tors responsible for tourism development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-ii-&#13;
(b) Developing and supporting locally owned hotels, restaurants,&#13;
craft associations, and other organizations and facilities needed to sustain&#13;
tourism.&#13;
(c) Preserving the integrity of sacred objects and events. Bali&#13;
(Indonesia), for example, offers only secular performances and crafts to&#13;
tourists; those that have religious purposes are kept separate.&#13;
(d) Using the income from tourism to strengthen local organiza-&#13;
tions and ethnic pride. The Balinese use the income from dance performances&#13;
to support village associations, domestic shrines, and the temple and to&#13;
provide motorbikes and education for village members. The Cuna of&#13;
San Blas have gained a sense of identity from the commercial success&#13;
of the "mola," a blouse worn by Cuna women and sold to tourists.&#13;
(e) Planning for tourism development at the local level and&#13;
ensuring that citizens participate in the planning. In Leavenworth, Washing-&#13;
ton (U.S.A.), tourism has become a byproduct of a community effort to halt&#13;
the town's economic decline and general deterioration. Outside experts were&#13;
called in to help organize festivals, improve the parks, and redesign the&#13;
downtown business district. But citizens participated in the planning and&#13;
in the activities that revitalized the town and later attracted tourists.&#13;
vi.        In developing countries sociologists can help foster citizen&#13;
participation by identifying the formal and informal channels of communica-&#13;
tion to local residents.&#13;
vii.       Through the Bank sociologists can help provide technical assistance&#13;
to developing countries interested in starting tourism development projects;&#13;
such assistance would help host countries maximize economic gains and mini-&#13;
mize social disruption from the projects. Areas of assistance could include&#13;
defining goals and policy; developing methods to monitor the social conse-&#13;
quences of tourism; creating organizations to establish and enforce rules&#13;
for land use, acquisition, and transfer; and analyzing alternatives to tour-&#13;
ism for attaining development goals.&#13;
viii.      Before approving a loan for tourism development, the Bank should&#13;
seek out sociologists to help appraise the merits of the project in question.&#13;
Sociologists and Bank officials should be satisfied that the project:&#13;
(a) -benefits all social strata in the host country, not just the&#13;
affluent;&#13;
(b) encourages local control over tourism development and fosters&#13;
continued local ownership of tourist facilities (e.g., by providing techni-&#13;
cal assistance to family *hotels);&#13;
(c) creates or strengthens "backward linkages" (agriculture and&#13;
other local resources to support the development of tourism);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d) is compatible with local culture and values, attitudes toward&#13;
tourism, and attitudes toward tourist-related occupations;&#13;
(e) is compatible with the number and type of tourists the destina-&#13;
tion area can accommodate (or expands the capacity to accommodate the&#13;
new tourists);&#13;
(f) provides for increased community services and facilities to&#13;
accommodate migrants to the tourist area;&#13;
(g) allows for citizen participation in tourism planning;&#13;
(h) allows for continued use of local resources by the host&#13;
population;&#13;
(i) provides for continuous monitoring of the impact of tourism&#13;
on the host country.&#13;
ix.       Finally, sociologists can help the Bank evaluate tourism projects,&#13;
once implemented, and alert the Bank to new trends that require alterations&#13;
in the project or in future projects.&#13;
x.,        The most serious deficiency in the literature on tourism is the&#13;
absense of a methodology for evaluating the social impact of tourism. Other&#13;
areas in need of further research include:&#13;
(a) studies of tourism development from the earliest stage to&#13;
institutionalization in different destination areas;&#13;
(b) the impact of tourism development versus the impact of indus-&#13;
trialization on developing countries;&#13;
(c) the impact on institutionalized versus noninstitutionalized&#13;
tourism on host countries;&#13;
(d)  the influence of the physical environment of the host country&#13;
on the type of tourists it attracts;&#13;
(e) patterns of migration to destination areas and the effect of&#13;
migration on kinship ties and other social obligations;&#13;
(f) the role of different ethnic and subcultural groups in con-&#13;
straining or promoting social change and contact with tourists;&#13;
(g) wages and education levels of employees in tourist-related&#13;
versus non-tourist-related occupations in developing countries with and&#13;
without institutionalized tourism;&#13;
(h) the impact of tourism on the status of women, particularly&#13;
their ability to gain or maintain income from tourism;&#13;
(i) local attitudes towards tourism and tourists at different&#13;
stages of tourism development;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-iv-&#13;
(j) the role and status of culture brokers at each stage of tour-&#13;
ism development;&#13;
(k) the impact of tourism on traditional patterns of land use,&#13;
land ownership, and exploitation of marine resources;&#13;
(1) the impact of tourism education programs on host populations;&#13;
(m) the development of social indicators (of the quality of life&#13;
in the host country) before and after tourism;&#13;
(n) the success of tourism plans in host countries--who has bene-&#13;
fited and why;&#13;
(o) distribution of income from tourism and the impact of tourism&#13;
on social structure, nutrition, health, and lifestyles.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.        Only within the last decade have sociologists begun to study or&#13;
to recognize the importance of tourism.-' Academics have traditionally&#13;
viewed tourism and other lIisure activities as frivolous or inappropriate&#13;
for study (see Parker, 92- ).   Moreover, the sociologist in a tourist area&#13;
is himself a tourist; this alone may have blinded him to the importance of&#13;
tourism.&#13;
2.         The sociological literature on tourism, while recent, offers&#13;
numerous valuable insights; these insights need to be supplemented, however,&#13;
with data from the other social disciplines--economics, geography, planning,&#13;
and administration, in particular. Supplementary analyses are necessary&#13;
because:&#13;
(a) Tourism cuts across both the rural and urban sectors. It&#13;
affects values, employment, social organization, the arts&#13;
and crafts, and contact between people. Tourism is a&#13;
strategy for economic development that has social and polit-&#13;
ical repercussions. It would be invalid to assess the&#13;
impact of tourism on the social and cultural life of host&#13;
populations without also considering the economic and&#13;
political impact of tourism.&#13;
(b) Sociologists tend to generalize from microstudies; other&#13;
disciplines tend to start with macrostudies and then partic-&#13;
ularize. Both approaches are essential to an understanding&#13;
of tourism.&#13;
3.         This paper draws together, clarifies, comments on, and adds to&#13;
concepts relating to the social impact of tourism. The author accepts full&#13;
responsibility for his clarifications and interpretations of the literature&#13;
cited here. The issues discussed in the chapters that follow complement top-&#13;
ics discussed in a seminar on The Social and Cultural Impacts of Tourism&#13;
sponsored jointly by the World Bank and UNESCO and held in Washington, D.C.&#13;
December 8-10, 1976. Chapter II examines definitions of a "tourist,"&#13;
tourist typologies, and local perceptions of tourists. Chapter III surveys&#13;
the literature pertaining to resources required for tourism. Chapter IV&#13;
describes three stages of tourism development. Chapters V - VII cover the&#13;
"encounter" between tourist and host and the socioeconomic and sociocultural&#13;
impacts of tourism. Chapter VIII discusses the elements of successful plan-&#13;
ning for tourism. Chapter IX recommends areas for further research and ways&#13;
in which Bank decisionmakers can take the social consequences of tourism into&#13;
account.&#13;

II. WHO IS A "TOURIST"?&#13;
4.         It is difficult to define who is a tourist or to put tourists into&#13;
categories. Different studies of tourism serve different purposes, host&#13;
perceptions of tourists differ, and people travel for different reasons&#13;
(spiritual, intellectual, material, biological, social, or combinations of&#13;
purposes). An attempt must be made, however, to define and classify tourists&#13;
and to ascertain the essential elements of the tourism phenomenon. Tourist&#13;
typologies are useful for determining the impact different types of tourists&#13;
have on host populations and host environments.&#13;
Definitions&#13;
5.         The most popular definition of international tourists is that pro-&#13;
posed by the United Nations Conference on International Travel and Tourism held in&#13;
in Rome in 1963:   "...temporary visitors staying at least 24 hours in the&#13;
country visited and the purpose of whose journey can be classified under one&#13;
of the following headings: (i) leisure (recreation, holiday, health, study,&#13;
religion, sport); (ii) business, family, mission, meeting..." The defini-&#13;
tion is both narrow and broad. It is narrow because it omits the important&#13;
category of domestic tourists. It is broad because it groups different types&#13;
of tourists together without regard for how the host population perceives&#13;
them and places no time limits that allow for distinctions to be drawn between&#13;
tourists and migrants. Would a host population treat a student returning&#13;
home during vacations as a tourist or a local resident? In addition, the&#13;
definition is contradictory. Can a pilgrimage be classified as a "leisure"&#13;
activity (even though it may partake of recreation)? Sociologically, the&#13;
definition is inadequate because it does not permit analysis of the impact&#13;
of different types of travel styles on the host population. How, for in-&#13;
stance, do the tourist and the host population interact? Nevertheless, the&#13;
definition has permitted collection of statistics on international travel by&#13;
categories of travel purpose.&#13;
6.         More recently, Cohen (16) has attempted to isolate the attributes&#13;
that characterize a tourist. He defines a tourist as "a voluntary, temporary&#13;
traveller, travelling in the expectation of pleasure from the novelty and&#13;
change experienced on a relatively long and non-recurrent round-trip"&#13;
(16: 533). Cohen analyzes each component of the definition. Take "novelty&#13;
and change," the purpose of the trip. That purpose, he points out, implies&#13;
"both institutionalized expectations" (what society tells the traveller to&#13;
expect, not what he actually experiences) and a certain behavior that corre-&#13;
sponds to these expectations. He then places each component on a continuum&#13;
to distinguish between. tourism proper and other forms of "partial tourism"&#13;
where tourism is incidental to the trip. Examples of the latter category&#13;
are thermalists, students, pilgrims, old-country visitors, conventioners,&#13;
business travellers, tourist/employees, and official sightseers. The term&#13;
''novelty and change" also enables Cohen to draw a distinction between the&#13;
sightseer and the vacationer. The former is interested in novelty, is multi-&#13;
destinational, tends to be a nonrecurrent visitor, and is inclined to visit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
"attractions" (unique sights, artistic treasures, exotic cultures). The&#13;
vacationer, on the other hand, seeks change (whether or not this brings&#13;
novelty), tends to be a recurrent visitor (or to frequent other places with&#13;
comparable facilities), and is more "oriented towards facilities and amenities"&#13;
(16:545)--for example, sun, sea, and sand.&#13;
7.         Cohen admits that his definition is a first attempt.    It needs&#13;
refining. The use of the term "pleasure" to distinguish between tourists and&#13;
nontourists seems too narrow. Tourism is undertaken for a variety of reasons,&#13;
many unconnected with even institutionalized expectations of pleasure. The&#13;
emphasis on distance ("a relatively long" round trip) could also be criti-&#13;
cized. It would seem that most visitors could be classified as tourists if&#13;
they stay temporarily, use local resources, and are perceived by the host&#13;
population as outsiders. Obvious exceptions include invading armies and&#13;
resident foreigners.&#13;
Typologies&#13;
8.         Tourist typologies are one of Cohen's main concerns (13, 15).     He&#13;
divides tourists into four main types on the basis of their willingness to&#13;
exchange familiar surroundings for the strange: (a) the organized mass&#13;
tourist, who generally travels in charter groups; (b) the individual mass&#13;
tourist, who travels singly but allows his travel arrangements (e.g., itin-&#13;
eraries, hotels) to be made for him; (c) the explorer, who travels to un-&#13;
charted or less known destination areas and makes his own arrangements; and&#13;
(d) the drifter, who travels to uncharted destination areas, takes them as&#13;
they are, and goes out on his tour without any set plan. A further criterion&#13;
is the degree of "institutionalization"--that is, routinization of patterns&#13;
of travel, routes, and times. On the basis of this criterion, types (a) and&#13;
(b) are grouped as "institutionalized" and types (c) and (d) are "noninsti-&#13;
tutionalized." Type (a) is the least willing to give up the environment and&#13;
style of life to which he is accustomed in his country of origin; the drifter&#13;
immerses himself almost totally in the host country and its ways. "Mass"&#13;
refers both to numbers and organization of tourists and tourism (see also&#13;
Pi-Sunyer, 95). Both Cohen and Forster (37) see the explorer as a trail&#13;
blazer for the institutionalized tourist.&#13;
9.         In his later article, Cohen (15) has second thoughts about the&#13;
"drifter." He is no longer the genuine individualist or rebel against the&#13;
phenomenon of mass tourism, but a child of the affluent 20th Century who has&#13;
succumbed to institutionalization by having his trails organized. The main&#13;
difference in Cohen's view between the mass tourist and the drifter is how&#13;
each views the host society. The former sees it through the bubble of his&#13;
aiiconditioned room; the latter, "from the dustbin." According to Cohen,&#13;
there are "full-time" and "part-time" drifters and each of these types can&#13;
be inward-or outward-oriented (i.e., preoccupied with onself versus inter-&#13;
ested in meeting other people).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
10.        The second example of a tourist typology is that proposed by Nunez&#13;
(87). Nunez suggests a taxonomy of ethnic and environmental tourism, inter-&#13;
nal and international tourism, packaged and programmed tourism and individ-&#13;
ual tourism, and recreational and educational/cultural tourism. Obviously,&#13;
the taxonomy is not discrete. Nunez admits that his taxonomies overlap and&#13;
are not definitive. Tourism studies are at too early a stage to attempt&#13;
definitive taxonomies.&#13;
11.       Another taxonomy of tourists is that constructed by Nolan (85).&#13;
His typology is based on frequency of travel and "travel style" (type of&#13;
movement). Nolan proposes four types of travellers:&#13;
(a) Limited travellers, who generally travel to fulfill an obliga-&#13;
tion or out of necessity.&#13;
(b) Occasional travellers. Members of this group take infrequent&#13;
vacations and often mix obligation with recreation. Occasional&#13;
travellers consider their infrequent vacations the highlight&#13;
of their lives.&#13;
(c) Regular travellers. This group tends to travel often but&#13;
usually to the same place.&#13;
(d) Extensive travellers, who genuinely enjoy travel and usually&#13;
manage to convert their travel to economic gain (for example,&#13;
by lecturing on their trips).&#13;
12.        Nolan arrives at five types of travel style, based on the traveller's&#13;
interest in the destination, adventurousness, and definiteness of purpose.&#13;
The five types are:&#13;
(a) Rapid movement--reaching the destination as quickly as pos-&#13;
sible. Rapid movement is characteristic of limited travel-&#13;
lers, though some regular travellers also fall within this&#13;
category.&#13;
(b) Fast-paced touring--a closely planned itinerary where reaching&#13;
the destination is more important than the journey. Fast-&#13;
paced touring can either be guided or selfstructured.     Occa-&#13;
sional and regular travellers are found in this category.&#13;
(c) Leisurely movement--a loosely structured itinerary, with the&#13;
journey and destination assuming equal importance. All types&#13;
of travellers except the limited traveller are found in this&#13;
category.&#13;
(d) Exploratory travel. The destination is the main object here.&#13;
There is little advance planning. This travel style is&#13;
generally characteristic of only the extensive traveller.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
(e)  Multipurpose, multidestinational travel.    The trip is care-&#13;
fully planned. There is a great deal of advance research&#13;
about the destinations. This style is to be found only&#13;
among extensive travellers.&#13;
13.        Most of these travel styles are found among all types of travel-&#13;
lers. Nolan therefore concludes that under certain circumstances travel&#13;
style may be more indicative of how a traveller is likely to behave in a tour-&#13;
ist destination area than frequency of travel is.&#13;
14.        It is unnecessary to list further examples of typologies.     Suffice&#13;
it to say that the typologies mentioned above are tentative and nondiscrete.&#13;
They are generally constrained by the purpose for which they were constructed.&#13;
Moreover, they do not account for host perceptions of who is or is not a&#13;
tourist. These host perceptions are discussed below.&#13;
Local Perceptions&#13;
15.        The literature on local perceptions can be summarized as follows:&#13;
(a) Members of the host population usually distinguish between&#13;
persons who share their values and concerns and "outsiders"&#13;
(see Reiter, 98).&#13;
(b) Persons may be considered outsiders even though they are&#13;
fellow nationals (Nunez, 87; Friedl, 41; Fukunaga, 42;&#13;
Hugill, 52; Packer, 91; Doxey, 24). Resident immigrants&#13;
are usually treated as outsiders (Packer, 91), though in&#13;
time they may come to be accepted as members of the com-&#13;
munity (Moore, 83; Pi-Sunyer, 95; Evans, 29).&#13;
(c) The host population distinguishes between outsiders who&#13;
are tourists and those who are not. Tourists are outsiders&#13;
who visit the area temporarily.&#13;
(d) The local population also distinguishes between tourists&#13;
who came at the early stages of tourism development and&#13;
those who come later. The population has a friendlier, more&#13;
accepting attitude towards the former than the latter (see&#13;
Smith, 107; Evans, 29). The changing attitudes are related&#13;
to changing local valuations of the benefits of tourism.&#13;
(e) Increasing numbers of tourists result in diminishing face-&#13;
to-face contact between the host population and tourists,&#13;
thus encouraging stereotyping of tourists. The Mexican&#13;
villagers (Nunz, 87) see all tourists as "Americans" because&#13;
of their affluent life styles and call the tourist enclave&#13;
"the American section." In Colpied and La Roche (France)&#13;
the villagers also see all tourists as belonging to one&#13;
category (Reiter, 98). Similar conclusions can also be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
drawn from Aerni's (2) article on Uganda and Greenwood's&#13;
(45) dissertation on Spain. The same stereotyping occurs&#13;
in Bali (Indonesia), according to Francillon (39),though&#13;
the author's experience would belie such a conclusion. The&#13;
conclusions mentioned above have not been arrived at through&#13;
in-depth studies. Where this has been done (see, for example,&#13;
Doxey &amp; Associates, 25, on Barbados) one finds that hosts&#13;
equate different types of tourists with different nationali-&#13;
ties. In Barbados, according to Doxey &amp; Associates, the&#13;
Americans are believed to be aggressive and demanding, the&#13;
British reserved but "more respectful of traditions," and&#13;
the Canadians quiet and unassuming and willing to "mix."&#13;
Cruise passengers are disliked. Similar categorizing of&#13;
tourists by nationalities exists in other areas (see Packer,&#13;
91).&#13;
(f) There is a widespread perception that all tourists are rich&#13;
(see Ashman, 5). National proclamations of the economic gains&#13;
from tourism, tourist accommodations that correspond to a&#13;
style affordable only by the upper classes in the host coun-&#13;
try, and tourists who spend more money in their short sojourn&#13;
than a substantial percentage of the host population earns in&#13;
a year all help foster that perception. The perception that&#13;
all tourists are rich may explain why the low-spending&#13;
"hippie" is seen as a fraud (Francillon, 39) who drives away&#13;
the bigger spenders while using the same services (Loukissas,&#13;
73; Hoagland, 49).&#13;
The Purposes of Tourism&#13;
16.        Most authors cite the curiosity of man, the social pressure to&#13;
travel in one's leisure time, escape, and the search for the "authentic expe-&#13;
rience" as reasons why people leave their homes for longer or shorter periods.&#13;
MacCannell (75), however, sees a higher purpose in tourism. He says that&#13;
''sightseeing is a form of ritual respect for society and that tourism absorbs&#13;
some of the social functions of religion in the modern world" (75:589). He&#13;
is joined in this view by Horne, based on a package tour of Ayers Rock (Cen-&#13;
tral Australia); Horne says that a market strategy "for organized tourism&#13;
would seem to call for anthropologists' reports on the disciplines of ceremony"&#13;
(49:10). There are not many who would agree with these analyses. It may be&#13;
that some tourists find a substitute religion in tourism, but tourism as a mass&#13;
phenomenon would not exist without leisure, a social obligation to take a&#13;
vacation, and technological advances (see, for instance, Robinson's study of&#13;
twelve South Asian countries, 102).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. RESOURCES&#13;
17.       This chapter will deal with resources thought to be conducive to&#13;
tourism. In economic parlance, this is the "supply" dimension of tourism.&#13;
18.       Authors of tourism studies agree, to a remarkable degree, that&#13;
tourists are attracted by pleasant climates, populations friendly to&#13;
foreigners, good beaches, exotic cultures, and historical and archaeological&#13;
monuments. Political stability is also important to attracting tourists.&#13;
19.       Loukissas (73) describes Mykonos (Greece) as clean and cheap; two&#13;
additional resources attract tourists to Mykonos, according to Loukissas--&#13;
a bracing climate and politically indifferent inhabitants (see also Packer,&#13;
91). Mykonos is also a boat ride away from Delos and its temples. Kanellakis (63)&#13;
cites the climate, "hospitality of the people," accommodation, and adequate&#13;
infrastructure as resources conducive to tourism in Greece. Both Calvo (11)&#13;
and Kjellstrom (66) point out that a good "image" helps attract tourists to&#13;
Morocco and the Caribbean. The good image of Rarbados, according to Doxey&#13;
&amp; Associates, "stems from its delightful climate, its physical attractions,&#13;
the friendliness and charm of its people, and its general stability" (25:17).&#13;
The Gambia, according to Esh &amp; Rosenblum (28), is marketed as a "touch of&#13;
Africa," the nearest place to Europe with a guaranteed 100% sunny climate.&#13;
Other resources promoted to potential tourists to The Gambia are sandy&#13;
beaches, a stable government, a "friendly, tourist-minded people," communi-&#13;
cation in English, and interesting excursions. &lt;People and cultures are "a&#13;
commodity" marketed to travellers whose main purpose is ethnic and cultural&#13;
tourism,) according to Greenwood (47). Bali, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and&#13;
Mexico are especially attractive to the ethnic/cultural tourist. Political&#13;
stability is important to tourism development, but the tourist is rarely&#13;
concerned whether the regime in power is authoritarian or democratic provided&#13;
it poses no real or perceived threat to life and security.&#13;
20.       Few sociologists include infrastructure (good roads, clean hotels,&#13;
adequate water supply, transport) as a resource for tourism development; the&#13;
omission is understandable since infrastructure is the province of the econo-&#13;
mist and the technical specialist. Surprisingly, however, even fewer&#13;
authors, sociologists or nonsociologists, include local skills, including&#13;
administrative skills, as a resource. This omission is inexplicable since&#13;
sociologists have stressed the importance of local competence to manage and&#13;
control tourism development as tourism grows. Packer (91), Forster (37),&#13;
and Greenwood (47) all maintain that destination areas lacking local admin-&#13;
istrative and technical skills inevitably lose control over tourism develop-&#13;
ment to wider political authorities. But such skills are not examined as an&#13;
existing resource. Nor is the development of this resource traced. Evans&#13;
(29) mentions in passing that returning residents of Puerto Vallarta (Mexico)&#13;
have developed skills and accumulated finances abroad. There is no detailed&#13;
discussion of how these primarily commercial and financial skills fit in&#13;
with the growth of tourism.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
21.       Administrative skills is 7 subject touched upon by Mitchell (82),&#13;
Diamond (21), and Kjellstrom (66).31 Mitchell suggests that administrative&#13;
skills are a "resource whose scarcity is equal (to) or more important" than&#13;
capital, "although documenting the fact is difficult... To the extent that&#13;
successful tourist development requires a higher degree of coordination&#13;
among a more disparate set of public agencies than the expansion of many&#13;
other activities, this factor will tend to reduce the relative attractive-&#13;
ness of tourism for poor countries" (82:221). Kjellstrom makes the same&#13;
point about Morocco; there, he adds, the two public bodies in the tourism&#13;
field have an ambiguous and inefficient relationship despite a 1965 World&#13;
Bank recommendation to merge the two (66:29). Diamond doubts that Turkey&#13;
has the ability to coordinate and manage the dispersed and comparatively&#13;
small units of tourism that characterize tourism there.&#13;
22.        Proximity of destination areas to countries of tourist origin is&#13;
another resource mentioned in the tourism literature. Tourist areas that&#13;
have this resource include Hawaii and the Caribbean. As Cohen points out,&#13;
"countries which are at present far-off the beaten track have only limited&#13;
prospects of success in the development of tourism on the basis of facili-&#13;
ties such as beaches, however magnificent these may be" (16:546). Such areas&#13;
would attract only the explorer or the drifter who make up a fraction&#13;
of the tourist trade; the explorer and the drifter could form a basis for&#13;
economic development only if the destination area is small in relation to&#13;
numbers of tourists.&#13;
3.        Kjellstrom admits his indebetedness to Mitchell, whose dissertation&#13;
he appears to have used extensively.&#13;
&#13;

IV. THE STAGES OF TOURISM DEVELOPMENT&#13;
23.       This chapter traces the stages of tourism development and describes&#13;
the essential characteristics of each stage.&#13;
A.   Theoretical Approaches&#13;
24.       Forster (37), Cohen (13), and Greenwood (46), suggest that tourism&#13;
development proceeds through three stages: discovery, local response and&#13;
initiative, and institutionalization. Each of these stages has different&#13;
consequences for both tourists and the host population. Each stage affects&#13;
the nature of the encounter between tourist and host and involves dif-&#13;
ferent organizational arrangements. The literature is brief;,what follows&#13;
is largely interpretive.&#13;
Stage I: Discovery&#13;
25.       In this stage a few intrepid souls "find" a new area.      Most of the&#13;
tourists who visit the destination area are what Cohen (13, 15, 16) calls&#13;
explorers, permanent tourists, and expatriates; a few are drifters. Travel&#13;
styles in the discovery stage are leisurely, exploratory, and multipurpose,&#13;
multidestinational (see Nolan, 85). The encounter between tourist and host&#13;
is face-to-face. The nature and extent of the impact of tourism at this&#13;
stage depends to a large measure on the population density of the destina-&#13;
tion area and its resources. The tourist takes the people as he finds them&#13;
and adjusts to the limited resources available; his adjustment to the host&#13;
is greater than the host's adjustment to the tourist. Hosts generally wel-&#13;
come tourists at Stage I; the population views tourism as desirable and the&#13;
tourists' interest in the host country as more than superficial. The atti-&#13;
tude of the host is one of "euphoria" (see Doxey, 24).&#13;
Stage II: Local Response and Initiative&#13;
26.       In Stage II the destination area gains popularity and attracts a&#13;
large number of tourists. The types of tourists attracted are the same as&#13;
in Stage I, however, and the contact between tourist and host remains face-&#13;
to-face. Like Stage I, Stage II is characterized by local decisionmaking&#13;
and control of tourism, local ownership and absence of standardization of&#13;
tourism facilities, and the use, primarily, of local resources. Tourism&#13;
development continues to be spontaneous and generally uncoordinated. The&#13;
needs of tourists are met through a differentiation of existing resources--&#13;
for example, creation of a local tourist association and partial conversion&#13;
of houses to guest homes or small hotels. The host population introduces&#13;
small-scale technological improvements to accommodate tourists--refrigera-&#13;
tors, motor boats, flush toilets. Nevertheless, the tourist's adjustment&#13;
to the host culture is almost as great as the host population's adjustment&#13;
to the tourist. The transition from Stage I to Stage II seems to require a&#13;
local catalyst (e.g., a resident immigrant or native entrepreneur).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
27.       The contacts between tourist and host and the necessary mutual&#13;
adjustments have their effects on the host population. Most of these effects&#13;
involve a reassessment of the means of attaining ends (values). Such effects&#13;
include: a desire for better education, increased tolerance for other cul-&#13;
tures, increased egalitarianism, increased employment, differentiation of&#13;
occupations, a higher standard of living, and increased contact with the&#13;
world outside the destination area. As the number of tourists increases,&#13;
the attitude of the host population towards tourism gradually changes from&#13;
"euphoria" to "apathy" (Doxey, 24). Towards the end of Stage II contact&#13;
between tourist and host becomes increasingly impersonal and formal. Tour-&#13;
ism revenues grow as the destination becomes established as a tourist resort,&#13;
but the local administrative, organizational, and economic resources appear to&#13;
be incapable of handling the volume of tourists; services break down. The&#13;
destination area is ready for Stage III.&#13;
Stage III: Institutionalization&#13;
28.       Institutionalization implies more than an increase in the number&#13;
of tourists in the destination area. It usually involves: standardized&#13;
tourist facilities and services (Western style hotels, packaged tours),&#13;
formal contacts between tourist and host, loss of local control over the&#13;
development of tourism, and increased economic dependence on individuals and&#13;
groups outside the destination area. In the eyes of the local resident,&#13;
institutionalization is the stage where outsiders (fellow nationals and&#13;
foreigners) take over.&#13;
29.       The transition to Stage III involves a decision by the national&#13;
government (or other authorities and economic blocs) to intervene in tourism&#13;
development in the destination area. This intervention is generally justi-&#13;
fied by the determination that&#13;
(a) local resources are inadequate to cater to increasing numbers&#13;
of tourists (because the facilities are not standardized,&#13;
for example);&#13;
(b) overall control and planning of tourism development are&#13;
necessary;&#13;
(c) the destination area lacks the financial resources and skills&#13;
to manage further tourism development;&#13;
(d) local sources of supply are incapable of satisfying tourist&#13;
demand.&#13;
30.       The most common justification for intervention in tourism develop-&#13;
ment by wider political authorities is that it will increase foreign exchange&#13;
earnings for the host country. Rarely does this intervention involve prior&#13;
consultation with the residents and authorities in the destination area itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Unless local interests are given a strong voice in decisionmaking, nonlocal&#13;
interests take over further development of tourism in the destination area.&#13;
31.        Institutionalization has the same effects on host populations&#13;
whether or not the tourists and hosts share the same cultural background.&#13;
The effects are:&#13;
(a)  Economic:   standardization of tourism facilities; increased&#13;
demand for goods and services resulting in seasonal fluctu-&#13;
ations of price and, at times, deprivation; wider range of&#13;
employment opportunities; changes in patterns and rhythm of&#13;
work; better diets for the local population; revival of&#13;
crafts.&#13;
(b)  Social:   population growth in the destination area and its&#13;
periphery as more people enter the area in search of work;&#13;
increasing need for public welfare services and increasing&#13;
impersonality and monetization of relations as a result of&#13;
population growth; standardization of roles and routiniza-&#13;
tion of organizational patterns; increasing isolation of&#13;
the individual and family unit; new or additional public&#13;
welfare services; increased intergenerational conflict as&#13;
the young come into contact with tourists; earlier marriage,&#13;
weakening familial authority, and smaller family sizes;&#13;
changes in social stratification (strengthening the top of&#13;
the social order, for example, or substituting new criteria&#13;
for evaluating status); increased opportunities for educa-&#13;
tion; introduction of new ideas, patterns, and ways of&#13;
life; "commercialization" of culture; increased social&#13;
deviance (e.g., crime, suicide, abortion); introduction of&#13;
new strains of disease (influenza, venereal disease).&#13;
(c)  Political:   loss of local control over decisions pertaining&#13;
to tourism; subordination of local residents to the role&#13;
of agents or functionaries; increased politicization of&#13;
local decisions (development of factions and parties);&#13;
change of the method of arriving at local decisions from&#13;
consensus to majority.&#13;
32.        These effects are subject to the following qualifications:&#13;
(a)  The tourist destination area will benefit most if it can&#13;
supply the increased demand for goods and services from&#13;
local resources. If not, the percentage of tourist&#13;
expenditure retained locally is reduced.&#13;
(b) The creation of new employment opportunities will be most&#13;
beneficial if there are no cultural restraints on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
occupational mobility or attitudes against working in&#13;
the tourism industry.4&#13;
Increases in the number of tourists tend to coincide with lower transport&#13;
costs (and greater numbers of "package tours" offered tourists). This, in&#13;
turn, permits lower income bracket tourists to visit the destination area&#13;
and lowers per capita expenditure. The greater the number of anticipated&#13;
tourists, the greater the need for expenditures for accommodation and infra-&#13;
structure. Tourist establishments within the destination area soon compete&#13;
with each other; the larger establishments with extensive contacts and finan-&#13;
cial resources push out the smaller. This leads to further changes in the&#13;
nature of tourism in the destination area.&#13;
33.        To paraphrase Doxey (24), the transition from Stage I to Stage III&#13;
involves not merely a "dimensional change" (for instance, increased numbers&#13;
of tourists), but also a "structural alteration" in the very nature of&#13;
tourism and a transition from "organic" to "induced" growth. In Stages I&#13;
and II the development of tourism is "organic"--it requires no changes in&#13;
social structure, roles, or cultural values. Tourists are accommodated&#13;
through existing local resources and institutions. In Stage III tourism is&#13;
planned and institutions superimposed on local organizational structures.&#13;
34.        In Stage III the type of tourist and the encounter between tourist&#13;
and host changes. Cohen's (13) "individual/organized mass" tourist pre-&#13;
dominates, along with a significant number of "organized drifters" (Cohen,&#13;
15). In general, the travelling style of these tourists is "rapid movement"&#13;
or "fast-paced" (Nolan, 85). The contacts between tourist and host become&#13;
increasingly impersonal. They are direct but "intermediate." The tourist&#13;
sees the host in the role of room maid or waiter; the host sees the tourist&#13;
as a room occupant in a large hotel.&#13;
35.        Most destination areas pass through all three stages of tourism&#13;
development; but no destination area has to pass through the three stages or&#13;
pass through them in the order mentioned. In recent times, several develop-&#13;
ing nations have commenced tourism development, as a strategy for economic&#13;
development, at Stage III or have bypassed Stage II. Two examples are Fiji&#13;
and Guam. Disneyland is the most popular example of "induced" tourism in a&#13;
developed country. Institutionalization can, theoretically, occur before&#13;
the advent, and in expectation, of tourists, because the crucial element is&#13;
loss of control in decisionmaking with consequent role alterations and exter-&#13;
nal dependence.&#13;
4.        Kanellakis (63), for instance, says that Greeks have a negative&#13;
attitude toward hotel employment "which assimilates the profession to that&#13;
of a 'servant' profession which is not held in high esteem" (56:68-9). It&#13;
is difficult to get hotel employees, and few stay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
B. Applications&#13;
36.       Only a few authors have traced tourism development in a single&#13;
destination through all three stages: Fraser (40) in Tajos (Spain); Robineau&#13;
(101) in Tahiti; Smith (108) in Point Gambell, Alaska (U.S.A.); and Packer&#13;
(91) in Leavenworth, Washington (U.S.A.). The stages of tourism development&#13;
in Mykonos can be pieced together through the works of three authors--&#13;
Packer (91), Loukissas (73), and Hoagland (49).&#13;
37.       There are several reasons for the small body of literature:&#13;
(a) There is no uniform timeframe within which a destination&#13;
area proceeds through the stages. Some areas--Fuenterrabia&#13;
(Spain), for instance--take several decades; others, such&#13;
as Mykonos, a few years. Few investigators can spend the&#13;
time required to trace tourism development in one destina-&#13;
tion when it is impossible to forecast how long the develop-&#13;
ment will take or whether tourism will indeed develop.,&#13;
(b) Interest in the sociology of tourism is relatively new.&#13;
Many destination areas (Hawaii, for instance) have long&#13;
since reached Stage III. Reconstruction of the initial two&#13;
stages is almost impossible.&#13;
(c) Some studies cover only Stages I and II, because the des-&#13;
tination areas had not reached Stage III by the time the&#13;
studies were completed. Bali, San Blas (Panama), and Los&#13;
Santos (Spain) were in transition from Stage II to Stage&#13;
III when they were studied. Bali is just entering Stage&#13;
III. The Los Gruyos project will usher in Stage III in&#13;
San Blas. By the end of the Los Santos study the local&#13;
landlords had started negotiating with outsiders for con-&#13;
struction of hotels and airline charter parties.&#13;
(d) Some studies of destination areas represent lost opportuni-&#13;
ties, largely because their focus is not related to the&#13;
historical development and impact of tourism (Greenwood's&#13;
study of Fuenterrabia, for example), or because inadequate&#13;
"hard" data was collected.&#13;
(e) It is extremely difficult to isolate the effects of tourism&#13;
development, because tourism and other sectors commonly&#13;
develop simultaneously. (In some countries, however,&#13;
tourism is the predominant method of development; two&#13;
examples are Antigua and Bali.)&#13;
38.        Without planning and local participation, Stage III, taken to its&#13;
logical limits, results in a "total economic system" in which the tourist&#13;
destination area becomes an annex of the host country run, managed, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
controlled by outsiders. The local population serves the tourist in menial&#13;
roles; citizens not employed in the tourism industry continue their daily&#13;
activities unconcerned with and unaware of the tourist (see Robineau, 101;&#13;
MacCannell, 75).&#13;
C. Analysis&#13;
39.       The impact of tourism varies even among destinations that might&#13;
be considered at the same stage of tourism development. The effects of&#13;
tourism on Bali, Tahiti, Mykonos, and New Zealand have been different; yet&#13;
all are islands in Stage III of tourism development. Tourism has affected&#13;
Bodrum (Turkey) less than Fuenterrabia. Colpied has experienced a greater&#13;
loss of local control than La Roche has, though both destinations started&#13;
tourism development at approximately the same time, are in the south of&#13;
France, and were at more or less the same level of economic development when&#13;
tourism began. Tourism does not seem to have affected social structure,&#13;
values, and goals in Leavenworth. How can these differences be explained?&#13;
40.       Force (35) has suggested that island ecosystems are more fragile&#13;
than mainland systems and that the impact of tourism is therefore greater on&#13;
islands. But the difference in impact of tourism on Bali, Mykonos, and&#13;
Fuenterrabia disproves this. The impact of tourism has been greater in&#13;
Fuenterrabia than in Tajos (both on the Spanish mainland). Nor are mere num-&#13;
bers of tourists in relation to the total local population a universally&#13;
valid test. Both Fuenterrabia and Los Santos often have tourists far out-&#13;
numbering their total resident population, but the impact of the tourists on&#13;
the destinations differ. Different cultures seem to have different tolerance&#13;
levels for large numbers of tourists. The Center for Economic Research in&#13;
Greece estimates that two million is the optimum number of tourists that&#13;
Greece can accommodate during the peak month (July) without compromising the&#13;
Greek way of life (Kanellakis, 63). Yet this figure is "quite conservative"&#13;
compared to the densities "on Copacabana (Brazil) beaches on a peak Sunday"&#13;
(Dasmann et al., 18:132). A reexamination of Leavenworth, Bali, New Zealand,&#13;
La Roche, and Bodrum might provide answers.&#13;
41.   -   The origin of tourism in Leavenworth can be traced to a citi-&#13;
zen's meeting which initiated a project called Leavenworth Improvement for&#13;
Everybody (LIFE). The meeting had been called to find ways of halting the&#13;
deterioration of the town, resulting from declining economic opportunities,&#13;
and emigration, and the abandonment of businesses. The purposes of the LIFE&#13;
project were to "create a spirit of community involvement and cooperation...&#13;
(and) to make Leavenworth a more attractive town in which the residents could&#13;
take pride and its youth would...be stimulated to find the means by which to&#13;
live and work there" (Packer, 91:197). The meeting gave rise to various com-&#13;
mitt-ees that studied the problem, prepared plans, and, over the course of&#13;
years, organized festivals, improved parks, redesigned downtown architecture&#13;
(with the aid of interested outsiders who later became residents), and attracted&#13;
new business. Tourism was a byproduct of these changes. It was not the major goal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
of the LIFE project.   The improvements initiated hv the LIFE oroject are tised torlav&#13;
by both tourists and residents, and tourism has supplanted the project as a&#13;
major activity in Leavenworth. But the residents still consider the original&#13;
goals and activities of the LIFE project important. The community events&#13;
that now attract tourists (the Autumn Leaf Festival, for example) also pro-&#13;
vide an opportunity for residents to meet each other. Planning was an essen-&#13;
tial element in the revitalization of Leavenworth. Where expertise was lack-&#13;
ing, it was attracted or called in from outside; but citizens themselves&#13;
participated in the formulation and execution of plans.&#13;
42.       In Bali, the main sources of income from tourism are hotel&#13;
employment, cultural performances, and the sale of crafts. Before the advent&#13;
of tourism the Balinese made crafts and temple ornaments and performed dances&#13;
for religious purposes (see McKean, 79, 80). Today tourism offers the Bali-&#13;
nese an additional market or stage for doing the things they enjoy. Although&#13;
dance and crafts have been influenced by tourism, the Balinese carefully&#13;
separate performances and crafts that have religious purposes from those&#13;
offered to tourists. The two audiences (divine and tourist) are kept separate.&#13;
Without the tourists the religious dances would still be performed and the&#13;
crafts made. Tourism merely supplements the income of the dancers and crafts-&#13;
men; it has expanded but not fundamentally changed their roles.&#13;
43.       Institutionalized tourism has hardly affected the Maori way of life.&#13;
As Ritchie says, "Apart from a few tour guides and one or two carvers this...&#13;
has provided an economic base for living to practically no one. Concert&#13;
parties may perform for the tourists but can only earn trifling sums this&#13;
way, and if they do not wish to do so, to the fury of the tour directors,&#13;
they won't. The persistence of Maori culture has been private rather than&#13;
public..." (100:51).&#13;
44.       La Roche, unlike Colpied, has retained control over tourism develop-&#13;
ment; the key to retaining control is sufficient differentiation of skills.&#13;
The variety of associations and skills represented in La Roche have enabled&#13;
the village to respond more flexibly than Colpied to the demands of tourism.&#13;
45.       Bodrum is the major supplier of goods for its subdistrict and in-&#13;
come from tourism forms only a small percentage of business income. In addi-&#13;
tion, government agencies played an active role in planning the social&#13;
development of the area. Here, too, there was organizational differentiation.&#13;
46.        Differentiation of skills, or "structural complexity," is common&#13;
to most of the examples above--to Leavenworth and, to a lesser extent, Bali&#13;
and Bodrum. But in both Bali and Bodrum, the skills (and the organizations&#13;
which represent them) do not extend much beyond traditional occupations-*&#13;
dancing, craftsmanship, and so forth. Thus, if the growth of tourists&#13;
exceeds the local capacity to manage them or the type of tourists changes,&#13;
then the loss of control common to Stage III will occur. In Bali, increas-&#13;
ing control by outsiders has already become evident (see Noronha, 86); the&#13;
wider political authorities have taken over further tourism planning and&#13;
development. In Bodrum a similar process has taken place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
47.       A second trait shared by Leavenworth, Bali, and New Zealand is&#13;
"duality of meaning." In Leavenworth, the LIFE project provided the town's&#13;
population with meanings independent of tourism. The project and subsequent&#13;
events reaffirmed the identity of Leavenworth, gave the residents pride in&#13;
their town, and bound people together through recognized social organizations.&#13;
In Bali dance associations are controlled by and linked with wider village&#13;
organizations and the temple. The income derived from performances for&#13;
tourists is channelled back to strengthen the villages, the temple, and the&#13;
domestic shrines and also used to provide motorbikes and education to the&#13;
village members. Tourism has strengthened ethnic pride. The same was the&#13;
case, in the initial stages of tourism, with the Cuna of San Blas (Swain,&#13;
110); there the "mola" (a blouse worn by the women) was not merely the object&#13;
of tourist demand, but also a symbol of Cuna identity and ethnic pride. In&#13;
all three cases the meaning of an object or event is different for the host&#13;
than it is for the tourist, and the two meanings are not confused. Tourism&#13;
has given the Balinese and the Maori an added sense of strength. It has&#13;
shown the population that being Balinese or being a Maori is not a matter of&#13;
residence, but a matter of birth and behavior; no outsider can ever become&#13;
either a Balinese or a Maori.&#13;
48.        The one element that separates Leavenworth from the other destina-&#13;
tion areas is planning. Planning with local participation was present in&#13;
Leavenworth from the earliest stage of development. It is this element,&#13;
together with the others, that has enabled Leavenworth to avoid the seemingly&#13;
inevitable consequences of Stage III.&#13;
49.        Finney and Watson (34) express the principles stressed in the last&#13;
three paragraphs in a different way. They warn Pacific Island governments&#13;
attempting to imitate tourism development in Hawaii that Hawaiian tourism&#13;
was built on a "much stronger base then now exists in most other Pacific&#13;
islands." Before tourism grew, Hawaii had a developed economy and a well-&#13;
educated and skilled population. And even in Hawaii lack of planning&#13;
(except in very recent times) has caused problems.&#13;

V. THE ENCOUNTER&#13;
50.       This chapter covers the theoretical aspects of the encounter be-&#13;
tween tourist and host, the relationship between the type of tourism and the&#13;
nature of the encounter, the role of the "culture broker," who the tourist&#13;
meets, changing attitudes toward tourism, and the impact of tourism on local&#13;
values and attitudes.&#13;
Theoretical Analysis of the Encounter&#13;
51.       The tourist is a stranger in an unfamiliar land.     He is a temporary&#13;
visitor influenced by his own background, information, and conceptions of his&#13;
role. He has to make some adjustments. The degree to which it is necessary&#13;
for him to adjust is determined by his own personality, the purpose of his&#13;
visit, his expectations, the extent to which there is a socially prescribed&#13;
behavior for tourists in the destination area, the tourist's awareness of&#13;
this, the length of his visit, whether he is an institutionalized or a non-&#13;
institutionalized tourist, and the number of occasions he has visited the&#13;
destination area. In effect, greater familiarity with the destination area&#13;
will provide the tourist with better cues about his own behavior.&#13;
52.       Equally, the host has his own conceptions about his expected role&#13;
and behavior towards the tourist. The more explicit his role, the more&#13;
likely he is to be aware of that role. Where tourism has existed for some&#13;
time one would expect the roles to be well defined. But tourists and hosts&#13;
do not necessarily agree on their respective roles; therefore, the encounter&#13;
between tourist and host has within it the seeds of both good and ill will.&#13;
53.       Sutton (110) lists four reasons why the meeting between tourist&#13;
and host can lead to mutual resentment:&#13;
(a) The relationship between host and visitor is generally&#13;
transitory and nonrepetitive.&#13;
(b) There is an orientation on the part of both parties to&#13;
immediate gratification.&#13;
(c) The relationship is asymmetrical; the host knows more than&#13;
the tourist does about local resources and prices.&#13;
(d) The tourist's search for the novel and desire to see&#13;
"everything" in a short time imposes a strain on both the&#13;
tourist and the host. (See also Nunez, 88.)&#13;
Examples of the initial unfamiliarity and consequent fears of the tourist&#13;
can be found in the contacts between Jews and their coreligionists in Iran&#13;
(Loeb, 72) and the humorous analysis of "exchange rate trauma" by Adams (1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
The Encounter and the Type of Tourism&#13;
54.       The nature of the encounter--and whether it breeds good will or&#13;
resentment--depends on:&#13;
(a) The duration of the meeting between host and tourist. One&#13;
would expect the more time hosts and tourists spend together,&#13;
the more likely they are to understand one another and widen&#13;
their range of contacts. But increased contacts could also&#13;
lead to resentment and disgust if each party believes he is&#13;
being exploited by the other.&#13;
(b) The type of tourist who visits the destination area.&#13;
(c) The persons whom the tourist meets, the purposes for which&#13;
they meet, and the persons who arrange the meeting.&#13;
55.       Cohen (13, 15) draws a distinction between mass tourists, on the&#13;
one hand, and explorers and drifters on the other. His tourist typologies&#13;
can be combined with Nolan's (85) travel styles. The explorer, the extrovert&#13;
drifter, the fast-paced self-structured traveller, the leisurely movement&#13;
traveller, and the multipurpose, multidestinational traveller can be grouped&#13;
under one category. All are more likely than the remaining types of tourists&#13;
to appreciate and look on their own for novelty, mingle with the host popula-&#13;
tion, adjust to the host society, and stay in the destination area longer.&#13;
56.       The nature of the encounter apparently depends largely on the&#13;
extent to which the tourist is "institutionalized"--that is, the extent to&#13;
which his itinerary, timetable, and "sights" are chosen for him. Contacts&#13;
between hosts and institutionalized tourists are formal; contacts between&#13;
the tourist and his fellow tourists are less structured. The institutional-&#13;
ized tourist is a creature of the packaged tour. He moves, as Samy (103)&#13;
says, like a "registered parcel." This does not mean that the tourist doesn't&#13;
believe he is seeing unique sights or getting an authentic feel for the place&#13;
he is visiting. His limited knowledge of the destination area may lead him&#13;
to believe he "knows" a people within a short time. Unfamiliar cultures soon&#13;
lose their distinguishing characteristics to the institutionalized tourist;&#13;
one country can be easily substituted for another. Esh and Rosenblum (28)&#13;
note that to the charter tourist in The Gambia it does not really matter&#13;
what country provides good beaches, sunshine, and friendly tourist-minded&#13;
people; what matters is the price. This type of tourism demands greater&#13;
adjustments by the hosts than by the tourist. Today package tours can be&#13;
arranged to serve virtually every human need; the tourist's purpose influences&#13;
the encounter less than his degree of institutionalization does.&#13;
57.        The literature appears to support these conclusions.    May (76) says&#13;
tourism has had little impact on the people of Papua New Guinea because&#13;
geographic limitations and the tourists' minimal interest in the arts have&#13;
limited the contact between tourist and host. Samy (103) says that Fijian&#13;
employees in hotels have to play a role built for them thousands of miles&#13;
away--the carefree childlike innocent who dresses in grass skirts and per-&#13;
forms war dances. Fijian hotels reproduce a Western ambience and standard&#13;
of comfort; their menus merely translate "Prime New York Cut Sirloin" and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
other Western dishes into the local language to add a touch of the exotic.&#13;
Esh &amp; Rosenblum (28) say that the charter tourist in The Gambia generally has&#13;
a very superficial interest in the local population. Francillon (39) says&#13;
there is very little contact between the institutionalized tourist and the&#13;
local population in Bali. The tourist arrives, is whipped out for a shopping&#13;
tour, is taken on a tour of carefully selected objects of cultural and archi-&#13;
tectural interest, views a few dances, and is moved out to make room for the&#13;
next mass tourist. The local population, in turn, tends increasingly to&#13;
stereotype tourists as "the same little old ladies, with the same blue hair&#13;
rinses" (Samy, 92).&#13;
58.       Calvo (11) says there may be a relationship between the type of&#13;
tourist accommodation and social impact of tourism on the local population.&#13;
Robineau (90), referring to the encouragement of international hotel chain&#13;
building to speed up tourism development in Tahiti, extends this idea. The&#13;
first two international hotels brought with them travel bureaus, internal&#13;
transport systems, and a local airline network. "Mass international tourism"&#13;
adds spatial segregation, he says, through the building up of "geographic&#13;
blocks or aggregates composed of large-scale tourist units which operate as&#13;
closed systems; and the movement of tourists outside the block within a social&#13;
space cut-off from that of the majority of the population. Pushed to the&#13;
limit, this model leads to turning the tourist zone into an annex of'the&#13;
countries providing the tourists" (101:67). Kent (65) calls this "total&#13;
tourism."&#13;
59.       In sum:   As tourism develops there is a tendency for international&#13;
hotel chains, linked with airlines, to create a system that replicates the&#13;
environment of the countries of tourist origin. This system requires greater&#13;
adjustments by the host and fewer adjustments by the tourists. Time con-&#13;
straints and schedules generally limit contact between tourist and host to&#13;
formally structured encounters. This limits the exchange of ideas between&#13;
host and tourist. There is a greater likelihood of informal, unstructured&#13;
relationships between tourists than between tourists and hosts, partially&#13;
justifying Horne's (49) conclusion that "tourists go on tours to meet other&#13;
tourists." The institutionalized tourist may believe he is sharing an unfa-&#13;
miliar culture, but he does not give up the security of a familiar environ-&#13;
ment.&#13;
60.       The evidence regarding the type and depth of contact between the&#13;
noninstitutionalized tourist and host is mainly inferential. We do not know&#13;
whether the early enthusiasm of the hosts toward these tourists continues&#13;
with the growth of institutionalized tourism. Is the noninstitutionalized&#13;
tourist different from the institutionalized tourist only in that he must&#13;
make his own arrangement? Does he have sources of information and contacts&#13;
that permit greater contact with hosts? Surely, the information network&#13;
developed by the "modern explorers" (i.e., "hippies") would provide this&#13;
advantage. But even members of this group, as Allsop (4), Cohen, (14) and&#13;
Theroux (113) suggest, have had their trails organized; and their contacts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
are more with each other than with the local population.     One could still&#13;
infer, however, that the noninstitutionalized tourist makes greater adjust-&#13;
ments to the population of the destination area and the services available.&#13;
61.       Finally, the tourist's purpose does influence his encounter with&#13;
the host, albeit less than his degree of institutionalization does. Where,&#13;
for instance, the tourist is interested in sun and sand (as in the case of&#13;
the charter tourist in The Gambia) or in safari tourism (as in Kenya), his&#13;
contact with the local population is likely to be minimal and confined to&#13;
the provision of services. But, Cohen's (16) "vacationer," while mainly&#13;
interested in facilities, is likely to make contact with the local popula-&#13;
tion, particularly if he goes repeatedly to the same resort.&#13;
The Setting of the Encounter&#13;
62.       An analysis of the encounter should consider the physical environ-&#13;
ment where the encounter takes place. Sociologists, however, have tended to&#13;
focus on the participants in the encounter to the neglect of the setting&#13;
(MacCannell, 75, and Nunez, 88, are examples). Hugill (52), a geographer,&#13;
demonstrates that the physical environment helps determine the type and be-&#13;
havior of the tourists who visit the Golden Mile in Southend-on-Sea (England).&#13;
Who Does the Tourist Meet?&#13;
63.       The evidence here is clearer for the institutionalized than for&#13;
the noninstitutionalized tourist. Studies of Cajitilan (Mexico), Leavenworth,&#13;
Bodrum, The Gambia, Alaska, Israel, and Mykonos indicate institutionalized&#13;
tourists make contact mainly with persons in service occupations--vendors,&#13;
boat owners, waiters. In Mykonos, Loukissas (73) points out, the aristocrats&#13;
and local elite are affected by tourism but seldom come in contact with&#13;
tourists. The upper classes try to leave the island during the tourist sea-&#13;
son. Data regarding noninstitutionalized tourists is inadequate. One could&#13;
hypothesize, however, that with more time and less structure the noninstitu-&#13;
tionalized tourist will encounter hosts from a variety of stations in life&#13;
and with less formality.&#13;
Mediators and Mediums: The Culture Brokers&#13;
64.       The culture broker--the individual who straddles two cultures and&#13;
serves as an interpreter for both--recurs in the literature. He assumes a&#13;
variety of roles and is found among all age groups; he is an entrepreneur and&#13;
an agent of social change. In Mexico he is the Guadalajara businessman&#13;
(Nunez, 87), the returning resident, the resident American, and the boy who&#13;
conducts a tour for visiting optometrists (Evans, 29). In Los Santos the&#13;
culture brokers are Swedes and the defrocked nuns (Moore, 83). In Valloire&#13;
(France) the culture broker is the mayor--even though he fails (Hutson, 53).&#13;
In Eilat (Israel) the culture brokers are the Arab boys (Cohen, 14); In Iran&#13;
they are the Jewish merchants (Loeb, 72). In the Southwest region of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
United States two examples of culture brokers are Fred Harvey and Don&#13;
Lorenzo Hubbel (Deitch, 19). In Bodrum and Mykonos the male youths serve as&#13;
culture brokers for the tourists, while the local populations are served by&#13;
resident foreigners and nonresident fellow nationals (Packer, 91). In The&#13;
Gambia the boys who hang around hotels serve as culture brokers (Esh &amp; Rosen-&#13;
blum, 28). Examples are numerous.&#13;
65.       The motivations for becomming a culture broker are also numerous.&#13;
In Mykonos, the knowledge of a foreign language (particularly English or&#13;
French) is a passport to a steady income. In Eilat and The Gambia, contacts&#13;
with tourists open up the possibility of foreign travel and escape from lim-&#13;
ited economic opportunities. For others in The Gambia the contacts are an&#13;
opportunity to learn about foreign cultures. In Cajitilan, Puerto Vallarta,&#13;
and Los Santos the skills of the culture brokers have introduced social&#13;
changes. Because the culture broker comes from a variety of stations in&#13;
life (usually not the most powerful) he is not necessarily the best inter-&#13;
preter. But some would argue that in times of rapid social change the cul-&#13;
ture broker can be an initiator of social change and an interpreter who helps&#13;
make the change compatible with local values (see Nunez, 88).&#13;
Changing Valuations of the Encounter&#13;
66.       Do host perceptions of tourists change?    Do all destination areas&#13;
reach a point where, as Sutton (110) puts it, the strain becomes too great&#13;
and the relationship between tourist and host sours? Do some societies&#13;
develop patterns or social rules for relating to tourists without imposing&#13;
strains on the social fabric? This section will attempt to answer these&#13;
questions.&#13;
67.       The literature contains several examples of the enthusiasm of a&#13;
host society towards its first tourists. Examples include studies of&#13;
Fuenterrabia, Los Santos, Tahiti, Alaska, and Mykonos. As tourism grows, the&#13;
host population draws a distinction between the earlier visitors and the&#13;
later visitors. The earlier visitor is remembered or regarded with favor;&#13;
the later, with little enthusiasm. The later visitors are treated as busi-&#13;
ness propositions; the earlier, as friends (Evans, 29). Intellectuals and&#13;
politicians inveigh against tourism, particularly in the Caribbean and the&#13;
Pacific. Crimes against tourists (again, mainly in the Caribbean) are&#13;
reported. Immigration procedures are introduced to bar the entry of certain&#13;
types of tourists.&#13;
68.       Doxey (23, 24) has attempted to trace these changes in attitude&#13;
and to construct an "irridex"--an index of level of irritation. Doxey be-&#13;
lieves that irritations resulting from the contact between tourist and host&#13;
cannot be wholly avoided; but unless they are identified and controlled,&#13;
he adds, they will destroy tourism in the destination area in the long run.&#13;
Doxey's "irridex" covers four levels of reaction:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
(a) Euphoria. Visitors and investors are welcomed in the initial&#13;
phase of tourism.&#13;
(b) Apathy. As contacts between tourist and host become more&#13;
formal, tourists are taken for granted.&#13;
(c) Annoyance. The host population begins to express doubts&#13;
about tourism as the number of tourists approaches the satura-&#13;
tion point.&#13;
(d) Antagonism. The host population overtly expresses its irrita-&#13;
tion; all ills, social and personal, are attributed to the&#13;
outsider.&#13;
69.        Doxey believes that irritation has interrelated economic, social,&#13;
cultural, psychological, and environmental causes. He makes two basic assump-&#13;
tions:&#13;
(a) The reactions of both visitors and hosts will vary in differ-&#13;
ent destinations.&#13;
(b) The root of local irritation is the belief that the outsider&#13;
"represents a challenge to the life style of the destination"&#13;
(24:195).&#13;
Some of the specific causes of irritation are:&#13;
(a) local fears of being treated as second to tourists;&#13;
(b) fears among locals that their culture is being threatened;&#13;
(c) exclusion of locals from physical amenities (beaches, for&#13;
example);&#13;
(d) tourists who antagonize locals by dressing or behaving&#13;
improperly.&#13;
70.        Doxey notes that destination areas are not homogeneous and the&#13;
causes of irritation depend on the value system of the destination in ques-&#13;
tion. The value system must therefore be identified. Implicit in Doxey's&#13;
irridex is the assumption that increasing numbers of outsiders are an essen-&#13;
tial ingredient of rising annoyance and antagonism. Doxey maintains that&#13;
irritations, while inevitable, can be identified and controlled through&#13;
planning and continuous monitoring.&#13;
71.        Doxey's analysis is useful in that it attempts to link the stages&#13;
of growing antagonism with the stages of tourism development described in&#13;
the previous chapter. But it is simplistic and raises several questions.&#13;
If tourism constitutes a challenge to the "life style" of a destination,&#13;
whose life style does Doxy refer to--those in power, the economically or&#13;
politically disenfranchised, or members of an established religion? Is the&#13;
disenchantment with tourism really the result of a (real or perceived) un-&#13;
equal distribution of tourism benefits? Does the majority of the host&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
population oppose further expansion of tourism? Is it number of tourists&#13;
that arouse fears or antagonism, the type of tourism or tourist, or the&#13;
difference in cultural background between tourist and host? These are some&#13;
of the questions that must be answered if the causes of antagonism are to be&#13;
identified and checked.&#13;
72.        It can be deduced from the literature that:&#13;
(a) The majority of the population of most destination areas&#13;
favor continued tourism. Surveys conducted in The Gambia&#13;
(Esh &amp; Rosenblum, 28), Barbados (Doxey &amp; Associates, 25),&#13;
Mykonos (Hoagland, 49), Leavenworth (Packer, 91), and Bali&#13;
(Noronha, 86) demonstrate this point. Only the Eskimo,&#13;
studied by Smith (107), opposed further tourism because&#13;
tourists ridicule his customs and diet.&#13;
(b) Mere numbers of tourists do not by themselves constitute&#13;
a threat (see paragraph 40.).&#13;
(c) The greater the cultural and economic difference between&#13;
tourist and host societies, the greater are the opportuni-&#13;
ties for misinterpreting behavioral patterns, nuances of&#13;
language, and customs. The literature is not conclusive&#13;
on this point, however. Where the tourist and host share&#13;
the same general cultural background, there does not appear&#13;
to be resentment against the tourist per se. Where tour-&#13;
ist-and host do not share the same cultural background,&#13;
the evidence is mixed. In the Caribbean, the example cited&#13;
most often, it is unclear whether the resentment of a vocal&#13;
minority is against the tourist per se or against the tourist&#13;
as a symbol of continuing national dependence on the foreigner&#13;
(Doxey &amp; Associates, 25). Calvo (11) points out that the&#13;
resentment is not expressed by those who earn their liveli-&#13;
hood from tourism but by the intelligentsia, who rarely&#13;
come in contact with tourists. In the Virgin Islands the&#13;
population resents the resident black alien more than it&#13;
resents the tourist (Blake, 9). There is no evidence that&#13;
the host populations of Uganda, Bodrum, Guam, San Blas, and&#13;
Puerto Vallarta harbor a generalized resentment of foreigners.&#13;
73.       Where antagonism exists, it is usually directed at institutional-&#13;
ized tourists and hippies. The resentment is expressed on two levels:&#13;
(a) Local. Institutionalized tourism contributes to the belief&#13;
that the local population and its resources are being "used,"&#13;
that the citizens are mere pawns in an economic game played&#13;
without their consent, by politically powerful outsiders.&#13;
Institutionalized tourism heightens the visibility of local&#13;
issues and problems. The real issue is distribution of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
political and economic power between the local and the&#13;
wider authorities, but tourism becomes a convenient focus&#13;
for local fears. This was the situation in Mykonos and&#13;
Fuenterrabia. The Cajitilan villagers resent intervention&#13;
by their national government into tourism development.&#13;
Similarly, the Guamanians, the villagers of San Blas, and&#13;
the villagers of Puerto Vallarta, are afraid that further&#13;
tourism development will result in intervention by the&#13;
national government and loss of local control.&#13;
(b) National. Many developing nations believe that tourism will&#13;
provide a source of foreign exchange that will-enable them&#13;
to modernize, but they lack the economic, technical, and&#13;
managerial resources to proceed on their own. Domestic&#13;
tourism is rarely well developed, and outside assistance from&#13;
financiers, international hotel chains, airlines, travel&#13;
agencies, and marketing experts is needed to attract&#13;
tourists on a scale sufficient to provide the exchange.&#13;
Hotels are constructed, airports expanded, roads built, and&#13;
incentives granted on the basis of present or anticipated&#13;
tourism. Governments make concessions, provide incentives&#13;
to foreigners--then realize that most of the tourist dollar&#13;
remains or flows abroad as a result. They believe there is&#13;
little that they can do. Nations such as Sri Lanka cannot&#13;
afford to invest in expanding their own airlines (Radke et al.,&#13;
97). They lack marketing resources. Tourism, again, becomes&#13;
the focus of fears and irritations, and the fears are often&#13;
expressed in terms of cultural values.5/ The institutional-&#13;
ized tourist, on the other hand, has a relatively formal and&#13;
super:fical7relationship with the local population and is&#13;
least able to influence the host population through direct&#13;
contact. He makes very few adjustments. Institutionalized&#13;
tourists, as Goldstein (44) suggests, have no social, emo-&#13;
tional, or economic commitment to the places they visit;&#13;
they do not have to learn social cues and are therefore&#13;
likely to overstep boundaries and cause resentment. The host&#13;
has to smile and accept almost every faux pas (see Kent, 65).&#13;
Only a few hosts, such as the Eskimo, fight back (See Smith,&#13;
107). The Greek and Caribbean population has been known to&#13;
react with "bad" service or physical violence. This is,&#13;
however, sporadic, and a complete understanding (as, for&#13;
instance, in the Caribbean) would also require an investiga-&#13;
tion into the sociocultural history of the destination area.&#13;
5.        See, for instance, the comments of Dr. Hibbert, Education Minister,&#13;
Solomon Islands, quoted in W.D. Patterson (93).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
Government antagonism toward the hippie is expressed mainly&#13;
through customs and immigration procedures. Cohen (15) sug-&#13;
gests that this antagonism stems from the ambivalence of&#13;
developing countries towards the West. These countries want&#13;
"selective modernization"--the good and the profitable, not&#13;
the bad. To the government official, Cohen explains, the&#13;
"long-haired hippie" is the symbol of "all that is negative,&#13;
rejectable or despicable in contemporary Western culture"&#13;
(15:102). A more plausible explanation is that the "puritan&#13;
ethic"--with its emphasis on hard work and postponement of&#13;
immediate gratification of needs--has been preached as the&#13;
forerunner and corollary of modernization (in socialist as&#13;
well as in capitalist countries). The "hippie" is a living&#13;
contradiction of the puritan ethic.&#13;
74.       Another aspect of the encounter merits separate attention:     does&#13;
tourism create perceptions of racial differences or exacerbate racial ten-&#13;
sions? Tourism does not seem to create awareness of differences in tourist&#13;
racial characteristics, though it may exacerbate perceptions of racial dif-&#13;
ferences between tourists and hosts, particularly when tourists belong to&#13;
the same race as the dominant economic group in the host country (Mitchell,&#13;
82). This was a conclusion with regard to Kenya, but Samy (103) also infers&#13;
that this is possible in Fiji, and Kent (65) suggests the same for Hawaii.&#13;
The source of the suggestion is the Caribbean, and yet even there, as Blake&#13;
(9, on the Virgin Islands) and Doxey &amp; Associates (25, on Barbados) point&#13;
out, provided the tourist comes from another island or country and fits in&#13;
with prevailing patterns of dominance which tend to reproduce an earlier&#13;
abhorrent system, the tourist would receive the same treatment irrespective&#13;
of race. In Doxey's example, the American Black receives the same indiffer-&#13;
ent service as his white counterpart. The examples of Kenya, Fiji, and the&#13;
Caribbean are instructive in that they point to the fact that there must be&#13;
an existing pattern of socioeconomic dominance in the host country. What&#13;
tourists do is to fit in with these patterns, resulting in socially deviant&#13;
conduct on the part of some members of the host population. It is in the&#13;
history of these areas that the answers lie. The tourist provides another&#13;
example of economic dominance and a reminder of social patterns that are dis-&#13;
liked. It is doubtful that there is a causative link between tourism and&#13;
racial tensions.&#13;
75.        Resentment is not an inevitable consequence of institutionalization;&#13;
planning, local participation, and differentiation help avoid antagonism of&#13;
hosts toward tourists (see paragraphs 41. - 49.).&#13;
Demonstration Effects&#13;
76.        "Demonstration effects" is one of the "buzz" phrases in the liter-&#13;
ature on tourism. Tourists are thought to be responsible for introducing,&#13;
by example, dating and marriages based on love and an increase in consumer&#13;
spending and demand for consumer goods (which reduces savings and capital&#13;
formation essential to growth).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
77.       The argument in support of the position that tourism affects local&#13;
values and the social structure of the host population is as follows: Tour-&#13;
ists are representatives of countries with cultures generally different from&#13;
that of the host population; their style of behavior their wants, their&#13;
tastes, and their habits differ. The local population attempts to imitate&#13;
tourists. This imitation results in the breakup of the social structure and&#13;
changes in value systems--for instance, the decline of community (Greenwood,&#13;
46).&#13;
78.       This deceptively simple argument is based on several assumptions:&#13;
(a) Every society has accepted models of behavior; tourists are&#13;
one model for the host population worthy of emulation.&#13;
(b) There is a direct connection between the host's contact with&#13;
tourists and changes in the host society.&#13;
(c) The changes are unidirectional--the tourist changes the host,&#13;
but the host does not change the tourist.&#13;
(d) The changes are generally destructive to the host culture&#13;
and social structure, particularly when the host country is&#13;
a developing country and the tourists come from a developed&#13;
country (see West, 119).&#13;
It is necessary to examine the validity of these assumptions.&#13;
79.       To be a model worth emulating a tourist must be accepted by the&#13;
local political and economic elite. He must be able to influence sections&#13;
of the host population to accept his values. The values that the tourist&#13;
induces must be dissonant with existing local values. Is the tourist such&#13;
a model? He does not appear to be one, except, possibly, to the youth of a&#13;
host country. Generally the models who stimulate changes are local residents&#13;
(sometimes resident foreigners) and national modernizing leaders. The&#13;
literature appears to support such a view. In Mykonos, the host population&#13;
imitates Athens (see Packer, 91; Loukissas, 73).    In Morocco, the tourist,&#13;
usually wealthy, is hardly "a model for malleable young Moroccans"&#13;
(Kjellstrom, 66:388). The examples of Eskimo youth looking down on traditional&#13;
values (Smith, 107) and the local population of North Kohala (Hawaii) develop-&#13;
ing an appetite for education and consumer goods demonstrate an emulation of&#13;
American values, not tourists. In Valloire, Cajitilan, and Kippel (Switzer-&#13;
land) the changes were brought about by local leaders (see Hutson, 53;&#13;
Nunez, 87; and Friedl, 41). Foreigners who have played a part in changes&#13;
have been residents and have had to make accommodations to the local social&#13;
and cultural patterns before they were accepted as leaders or models (see&#13;
Moore, 83; Packer, 91; Evans, 29).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
80.        It should be noted that most authors who refer to the "demonstra-&#13;
tion effect" have not carefully examined whether it is the local leaders or&#13;
the tourists who form the models. Packer has examined this question closely&#13;
for Mykonos, Bodrum, and Leavenworth. He sums up his position as follows:&#13;
"Significantly, the evidence suggests that tourists do not&#13;
serve as the motivating source for the adoption of (new)&#13;
values but are only the channel or medium for transmission&#13;
of such information...   Tourists serve primarily to focus&#13;
the information signal upon the residents of the community&#13;
so that supplementary channels for these values can be&#13;
established. The supplementary channels take the form of&#13;
foreigners and outsiders who come to live in the community...&#13;
it is the assumption of residency by these outsiders which&#13;
serves to make them function as effective models for&#13;
learning." (91:241)&#13;
81.       A second question is:   does the nature and extent of the contacts&#13;
between tourist and host permit the transmission of tourist values? As&#13;
pointed out earlier, (see paragraphs 63. and 72.) contacts between the&#13;
institutionalized tourist and host are limited in duration and depth. Fur-&#13;
ther, the institutionalized tourist appears to meet only members of the host&#13;
population directly involved in the tourism industry; rarely are such per-&#13;
sons leaders in their country. It could be hypothesized that the contacts&#13;
between the noninstitutionalized tourist and the host are greater and could&#13;
influence local values. But information on this is inadequate.&#13;
82.       Most authors fail to draw a convincing connection between tourism&#13;
and changes in values and social patterns. The changes in Fuenterrabia, for&#13;
example, could be attributed to industrialization and urbanization, which&#13;
took root before the development of mass tourism (Greenwood, 45). Even&#13;
Greenwood, who has been the most articulate about the deleterious impact of&#13;
tourism on local values, admits that Basque values have not changed. What&#13;
has changed is the assessment of the means of attaining those values (Green-&#13;
wood, 46). This is also the view of Ritchie (100) regarding Maori values.&#13;
To assume that the encounter produces unidirectional alterations in host&#13;
value systems is to deny the cultural resilience and cultural integrity of&#13;
the host populations; to suggest that all changes are harmful involves a&#13;
subjective judgment by the observer. Further, there is negligible evidence&#13;
that changes peculiar to tourism can be separated from changes found to&#13;
accompany modernization or industrialization. A final question, which the&#13;
literature deals with neither consistently nor satisfactorily, is: Assuming,&#13;
for the sake of argument, that changes in value systems do occur as a result&#13;
of tourism, are these not changes desired by at least some segments of the&#13;
local population?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
83.        One can infer from this discussion that tourists do not have the&#13;
impact on local population values that is often claimed. Tourists may&#13;
represent a style of life different from that of the host population.&#13;
Whether this style of life results in changes in the host population value&#13;
systems depends, however, on the method by which these values are transmit-&#13;
ted. Changes must be transmitted through prestigious residents. The "demon-&#13;
stration effect," then, is at most indirect and mediated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
VI. THE IMPACT OF TOURISM:&#13;
PART I - SOCIOECONOMIC&#13;
84.       This chapter evaluates the impact of tourism on employment and&#13;
occupations (other than arts and crafts), land and other ownership patterns,&#13;
competition for local resources, and demand for social services in host&#13;
countries. The chapter also discusses the distribution of the economic bene-&#13;
fits of tourism among host populations.&#13;
Employment&#13;
85.       A recurring theme of the literature is that tourism creates jobs&#13;
for the local population directly (in hotels, for instance) and indirectly.&#13;
In most tourism destinations the top hotel management is generally nonlocal,&#13;
with one exception--Antigua (see Joshi &amp; Sharpston, 61). This is also often&#13;
the case at the supervisory levels in hotels (see, for instance, Samy, 103,&#13;
and Kent, 65). The predominance of expatriate or fellow nonresident nationals&#13;
at the upper levels of hotel employment is a process that takes place with&#13;
the gradual development of institutionalized tourism.&#13;
86.       At the earlier stages hotels are generally locally owned and often&#13;
managed by families. As tourism develops, locals generally occupy the lowest&#13;
levels of employment in the hotel industry--waiter, busboy, room maid, gar-&#13;
dener, kitchen helper. Are these employees unskilled and semiskilled? There&#13;
are two parts to this question: whether they are unskilled/semiskilled in&#13;
regard to training and whether they are unskilled/semiskilled relative to&#13;
the general level of skills in the host population. Esh &amp; Rosenblum (28),&#13;
who studied employees of hotels in The Gambia, found 37% had no&#13;
formal education and 53% had a secondary school education. In Fiji&#13;
Samy (103) found that 45% of the Indo-Fijian staff had worked in agri-&#13;
culture, compared with 15% percent of the Fijian staff. For most of&#13;
the Indo-Fijian women, hotel employment was their first wage employment;&#13;
more than half the Fijian women employed, on the other hand, had worked as&#13;
nurses. On the whole, Fijians were the best educated members of the popula-&#13;
tion, next to the expatriate management. Based on this limited information&#13;
one can conclude that lower level employees, while not highly educated, may&#13;
belong to the relatively few in their country who have received formal educa-&#13;
tion. As Diamond points out with regard to Turkey, in a country where "50&#13;
percent of the adult population is illiterate, the possession of a foreign&#13;
language can be viewed as a skill" (Diamond, 21:611).&#13;
87.        The evidence discussed so far leads to another question:    Does&#13;
hotel employment divert labor from other sectors of the economy? Or,&#13;
phrased differently, is hotel employment in direct competition with other&#13;
sectors that could equally use the labor? Esh &amp; Rosenblum answer these&#13;
questions affirmatively: "...the tourist industry attracts the young and&#13;
relatively well educated people...who, from the outset, have a fair chance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
on the labor market..." (28:29). But later they qualify their answer by&#13;
noting that this situation might change with the expansion of tourism as&#13;
planned. In Fiji it is a matter of inference that the Fijian women, at least,&#13;
had been drawn away from other sectors. One of the fears in the Cook Islands&#13;
is that tourism will divert labor from other immediately productive sectors&#13;
(see LeFevre, 10); in Tahiti there has been a fairly widespread movement&#13;
away from traditional agriculture into the wage-earning sectors, including&#13;
tourism (Finney, 32). The evidence, however, is far from complete.&#13;
Kjellstrom says that in Morocco tourist "regions are not located in areas&#13;
where there are a multitude of alternative lucrative occupations available"&#13;
(66:278) and that hotel and restaurant business is preferred by unskilled&#13;
employees. In Sri Lanka 21.3% of the hotel employees interviewed had been&#13;
unemployed; for 17% hotel employment was their first job (Radke et al., 97).&#13;
It is suggested that any satisfactory answers to the question of competition&#13;
for labor must weigh both regional factors and data on whether the employees&#13;
were in fact capable of being employed elsewhere. The flood of applications&#13;
that hotels receive for employment (see, for instance, Fukunaga, 42; Esh &amp;&#13;
Rosenblum, 28) could be interpreted in two ways: that the applicants are&#13;
unemployed or come from areas of underemployment (for instance, agriculture),&#13;
or that they are being diverted from present employment because of the&#13;
attractiveness of hotel employment.&#13;
88.       The next question is from which geographical areas do the employees&#13;
come? Are they from areas proximate to the hotel? Do they come to the area&#13;
in search of another job (that is, after making the move from their own&#13;
native villages) and then secure employment at the hotel, or do they move to&#13;
the area only because of hotel employment? The answers to these questions&#13;
are far from satisfactory. The only data available are from the Esh &amp; Rosen-&#13;
blum (28) study of The Gambia and the Radke et al.(97) study of Sri Lanka.&#13;
In The Gambia 43.4% of the employees of the four charter hotels were born&#13;
in areas proximate to the hotels. Of those born outside, 19.2% moved into&#13;
the area before the hotels commenced business. Of the 33.5% who moved into&#13;
the area after the hotels commenced business, the authors found that only&#13;
17% could be considered genuine hotel/tourist migrants. In Sri Lanka 48.6%&#13;
of the employees of the four hotels surveyed resided in neighboring towns&#13;
and villages. Radke et al. (97), however, included temporary employees in&#13;
the study; moreover, they could not find out whether the employees were&#13;
native residents of the neighboring towns and villages or had moved there&#13;
before or after obtaining hotel employment. In Mykonos Loukissas (73) found&#13;
that most of the hotel employees were Greeks but not natives to the island.&#13;
In North Kohala, as in Guam and Truk, employees come from the areas&#13;
surrounding the hotels (Fukunaga 42; Fages &amp; McGrath, 30; Sanchez, 105).&#13;
It may be that potential employees are drawn from a wider geographical area&#13;
when tourism increases, reaches the "institutionalized" stage, and demands&#13;
higher levels of skill from employees.&#13;
89..      Do patterns of employment reflect local political and economic&#13;
strata? The clearest evidence available is in Samy's (103) study of a luxury&#13;
hotel in Fiji. There, employment reflected not only the economic power&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
structure of the country, but also the stereotypes hotel management and the&#13;
tourist industry had of different ethnic groups. There was no apparent&#13;
relationship between qualifications and type of employment. Europeans (mostly&#13;
expatriates) occupied almost all the executive and managerial positions; they&#13;
predominated in administration and reservations. Occupations requiring face-&#13;
to-face contact with tourists were staffed mainly by Fijians (e.g., reception&#13;
and tour desks, band, switchboards, bar, and security work), and other lower&#13;
level positions were staffed by Indo-Fijians (e.g., accounts, maintenance,&#13;
gardens, and kitchens). The management explained that the European is a&#13;
"public relations man," the Fijian "an extrovert," and the Indo-Fijian, "more&#13;
an introvert." The same sort of stratification appears in Tahiti (see&#13;
Robineau, 89): at the top are the foreigners (non-Tahitians), followed by&#13;
the "creoles" (Europeans born in Tahiti), the Chinese, the "demis" (descen-&#13;
dants of Polynesian-Europeans), and, at the lowest level, the Polynesians, who&#13;
constitute nearly 80% of the population. In Hawaii, Kent (65) points out,&#13;
the native born Hawaiian (as contrasted with the Haole) occupies the lowest&#13;
rungs of the hotel industry. This phenomenon, called "layering," is also&#13;
said to exist in Guam; the third and lowest layer of society (mainly native&#13;
Chamorro-Guamanians), performs menial tasks (Sanchez, 105).&#13;
90.       In Hawaii, Kent (65) says, the tourism industry pays lower wage&#13;
scales than the construction, communications and utilities, manufacturing,&#13;
and finance sectors. In Sri Lanka hotel wages rank in the seventh decile&#13;
when compared with average rural income for a household of four persons and&#13;
in the fourth decile compared with average urban income for a household of&#13;
four persons. Since most hotel employees interviewed were supporting house-&#13;
holds of more than four, however, the per capita income for hotel work (rela-&#13;
tive to rural and other urban employment) is actually lower than the seventh&#13;
and fourth deciles (Radke et al., 97). Sri Lanka was then entering the stage&#13;
of institutionalized tourism. The last two comparisons do not appear to be&#13;
general, however. In Morocco, for instance, earnings in the hotel and restau-&#13;
rant business can be as much as seven times higher than in agriculture and&#13;
"even twice as high as in construction work" (Kjellstrom, 66:279). This -&#13;
would appear to be the case in Bali (Udayana University, 116). Two infer-&#13;
ences could be drawn:&#13;
(a) Hotel wages in developing countries are generally higher&#13;
than wages in other sectors for persons with comparable&#13;
qualifications and ability;&#13;
(b) In developing countries with institutionalized tourism and&#13;
foreign hotel management, hotel wages are likely to be higher&#13;
than the wages in many domestic enterprises.&#13;
91.       Another aspect of this discussion of hotel employment is the rela-&#13;
tionship between employees and the chances of promotion for those at the&#13;
lowest levels. In Fiji and The Gambia--two areas for which there are data--&#13;
European expatriate managers show little understanding of local talents and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
needs. These managers believe that their hotels would fall apart in their&#13;
absence. The management in Fiji believes that the Fijian has a low intellect&#13;
and is not entirely honest. The management in The Gambia believes that the&#13;
Gambian lies and cheats and that Gambian culture (about which it knows little)&#13;
is inferior to European culture. Given these circumstances, it is not sur-&#13;
prising that promotion is rare. In his study of Hawaii Kent (65) forcefully&#13;
expresses another point: the skills learned in hotels (except, perhaps, in&#13;
hotel maintenance) are not readily transferable. Therefore, why should any-&#13;
one work in a hotel at a low level and be condemned at a young age to a&#13;
dreary, monotonous job from which there is no escape? Kent's argument should&#13;
be limited to the peculiar circumstances of Hawaii. Certainly, the chances&#13;
for promotion at the lowest levels of hotel employment are slim. But is this&#13;
any different from any other industry--say, for a factory worker in the steel&#13;
mills?&#13;
92.       The discussion so far has been confined to employment in hotels.&#13;
Tourism also has an impact on employment in transportation, travel agencies,&#13;
shops, the construction industry, and agriculture. Most of the evidence,&#13;
however, on tourism and employment (apart from hotel employment) is in the&#13;
nature of "guesstimates." The only clear evidence is to be found in Packer's&#13;
study (91) of Mykonos, Bodrum, and Leavenworth. In all three towns Packer&#13;
found that tourism increased employment both in traditional occupations and&#13;
in new occupations to which tourism gave rise. Particularly in Mykonos,&#13;
tourism income formed the basis by which the residents could modernize. This&#13;
modernization also took place in Bodrum and, to a much lesser extent, in&#13;
Leavenworth (where the reliance on tourism was much lower). In Mykonos&#13;
tourism plays a dominant role in the economy. It should be realized, however,&#13;
that in most other destination areas tourism plays a small role in the econ-&#13;
omy. In Fiji, for instance, only 5% of the labor force is employed, directly&#13;
and indirectly, in the tourism sector (LeFevre, 70).     In Tahiti the number&#13;
is 3% (see Robineau, 101); in Sri Lanka, 0.13% (Radke et al., 97). In Bali&#13;
the percentage of the working population employed in the tourism industry,&#13;
according to Udayana University (116), was 0.68% in 1972 and 0.45% in 1974.&#13;
93.       Despite the low percentage of employees in tourism and tourism-&#13;
related occupations (in relation to the total labor force) tourism employment&#13;
has a major social impact on host populations. Forster (37) suggests that&#13;
the character of tourist-related work changes with the advent of tourism&#13;
employment. 'But this is not the only result. There are five additional&#13;
major effects:&#13;
(a) Employment in the tourism industry is often seasonal.&#13;
Therefore, tourism employment must be supplemented by other&#13;
work (by agriculture, for instance, in Morocco or by carpen-&#13;
try, architecture, and other traditional occupations in&#13;
Mykonos). This is not always possible, and for many the&#13;
nontourism season is also the "hungry" season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
(b) The greater the dependence on tourism, particularly insti-&#13;
tutionalized tourism, the greater the likelihood of shifts&#13;
in demand that leave many unemployed, sometimes with no&#13;
possibility of finding alternative occupations. This was&#13;
the condition of Greenwood's (45, 46) Fuenterrabians. It&#13;
is the likely condition of the Tahitian who now prefers&#13;
wage labor to agricultural self-cultivation (Finney, 32).&#13;
The fear of shifts in demand and consequent unemployment&#13;
is prevalent among Mykonians today (Loukissas, 73; Hoagland,&#13;
49).&#13;
(c) A question raised by Nunez (88) is: If there is relative&#13;
insecurity in tourism why do so many individuals leave&#13;
their traditional occupations for employment in tourism?&#13;
A partial answer lies in the level of unemployment in tra-&#13;
ditional occupations, or the economic opportunity in the&#13;
tourist industry. However, as in the case of migration to&#13;
cities, income is only one reason for seeking tourist-related&#13;
employment; other motivations include: scarcity or loss of&#13;
land, better opportunities for children, and greater avail-&#13;
ability of social services (Force &amp; Force, 36).&#13;
(d) Tourism employment involves adjustments in hours and methods&#13;
of work. These adjustments may involve adjusting values and&#13;
therefore may take time. At the initial stages of tourism&#13;
development in Mykonos and Bodrum local landlords found it&#13;
difficult to accept payment from tourists for their accom-&#13;
modations because payments went counter to customary hospi-&#13;
tality. In Micronesia the residents face the same problem.&#13;
In Micronesia there are also differences between what the&#13;
Micronesians believe tourists will want in the way of food&#13;
and accommodation and what tourists actually want. For in-&#13;
stance, Micronesians do not want to serve papayas (which&#13;
are fed to pigs) and bananas (which the poor consume) to&#13;
tourists (who are believed to be wealthy); nor do they&#13;
want tourists to live in shacks without electricity when the&#13;
Micronesians prefer a "functional concrete cottage with an&#13;
electric light bulb hanging from the ceiling" (Ashman, 5:137).&#13;
To the Micronesian, the concrete is progress.&#13;
(e) The impact of tourism on families of migrants and on other&#13;
social relationships and responsibilities is a moot question;&#13;
hard evidence is limited. The Gambian who leaves his village&#13;
to come to work in the hotels does not ignore his responsi-&#13;
bility to kith and kin, according to Esh &amp; Rosenblum (28).&#13;
Ties with the extended family are apparently maintained, not-&#13;
withstanding migration to an urban environment (see Force &amp;&#13;
Force, 36). In Mykonos, the family continued as a viable unit&#13;
even though the tendency to live separately increased (see&#13;
Packer, 91). In Colpied, La Roche, Kippel, and Fuenterrabia,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
the decline of the extended family and mutual cooperation&#13;
resulted more from the influence of industrialization and&#13;
other sectoral development than from tourism.&#13;
Land&#13;
94.       The literature contains numerous references to speculative in-&#13;
creases in land prices and the gradual loss of land by the local population.&#13;
The value of land increased 2,000% in Mykonos (Packer, 91) and between 300-&#13;
900% in Kailua, West Hawaii (Fukunaga, 42). Such increases price land out&#13;
of the reach of most local residents for agriculture and other "traditional"&#13;
uses (Greenwood, 46; Fukunaga, 42).&#13;
95.        The process by which land values increase deserves examination.&#13;
At the early stage of tourism development it is the local owners who profit.&#13;
Land, often thought to be worthless (for example, nonagricultural areas near&#13;
the sea) obtains a new valuation as it can be put to a new use; the local&#13;
owner sells the property at an enormous profit. Alternatively, the local&#13;
owner converts the formerly valueless property to the new use and makes a&#13;
profit from it. As tourism develops, it is nonresidents, economically&#13;
powerful fellow nationals, who generally enter into the real estate market.&#13;
At this stage land prices soar above what some may consider their real worth.&#13;
At a still later stage of tourism development the national elite--often with&#13;
the direct or indirect financial backing of governments, (e.g., through&#13;
access to government-guaranteed credit) and in partnership with international&#13;
hotel chains--demands land which drives prices up still higher. This process&#13;
is not invariable. National governments may enter into the tourism field at&#13;
an early stage and acquire lands for a generally nominal compensation to the&#13;
original owners, thus deriving some of the enhanced value for themselves.&#13;
What is evident in the process is that fellow nationals themselves are the&#13;
first to make the profit. The main issue, then, is price, but deprivation&#13;
of local owners through what is retrospectively defined as fraudulent dealing.&#13;
96.        The effects of speculation can be viewed from two standpoints:     the&#13;
tenurial system involved and the development of policy. Where there is indi-&#13;
vidual tenure, as in Mykonos, Bodrum, Leavenworth, or Bali, the sale of land&#13;
is still a matter of individual arrangement and individual calculations.&#13;
Group tenures--found often in Africa, Asia, Melanesia, and Polynesia--are&#13;
generally "traditional" tenures. The acquisition or transfer of these lands&#13;
involve large numbers of individuals (including, at times, unborn persons)&#13;
who have "rights" to the lands. The application of principles of Western or&#13;
"common" law generally results in conflict between the owners and the acquir-&#13;
ing body or transferees. The conflicts stem from the different meanings of&#13;
the two legal systems and the original owners' understanding of the nature&#13;
of "rights" acquired or transferred. In "traditional" group tenures, where&#13;
generally there is no power to alienate lands permanently, it is essential&#13;
that these limitations be recognized and interpreted if future conflict is&#13;
to be avoided. A sociologist can play an important role here in interpreting&#13;
the nature of the transaction and suggesting techniques by which the transi-&#13;
tion to "modern" law can be effected smoothly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
97.       The second issue is the development of policy.     It is important to&#13;
determine what lands are sold, to whom they are sold, and for how much.&#13;
Restriction of sales and verification of price paid are important; but they&#13;
are meaningless if powerful interests can get around them through, for in-&#13;
stance, ostensible purchases in the name of a local resident. Policy without&#13;
the means or will to enforce it is useless. Wealthy Athenians were allowed&#13;
to construct buildings notwithstanding an order suspending construction; Turk-&#13;
ish economically powerful interests could do the same (Packer, 91). A&#13;
feasible approach, particularly in the case of group tenures, is suggested&#13;
by McGrath (77). He recommends the creation of land control boards as the&#13;
final authority in all land use cases. One goal of the board, he says,&#13;
should be to ensure that all land use proposals are in conformity with a mas-&#13;
ter resource development plan and to ensure that "there is maximum direct&#13;
participation by the original landowners by providing them with a propor-&#13;
tionate share of the annual profits and a share of the stock of the venture&#13;
undertaken on their land" (77:139). These proposals were first made for the&#13;
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in 1946 and are in effect in Fiji&#13;
(where native land is controlled by the Native Land Trust Board).&#13;
Ownership&#13;
98.       Linked closely with the previous section is the changing character&#13;
of ownership patterns--from ownership by residents to ownership by "outsiders"&#13;
(who may be residents for part of the year). These patterns apply both to&#13;
land and to business. In Leavenworth the downtown businesses are increas-&#13;
ingly owned by immigrants; the same can be said of Mykonos. In North Kohala&#13;
the supermarket replaces the neighborhood store; in Tahiti and The Gambia&#13;
the small family hotel is replaced by international hotels. But this is not&#13;
a universal phenomenon--Antigua is an example where local ownership still&#13;
prevails, though one can infer that ownership is mainly in the hands of the&#13;
local economic elite. The transition from local to nonlocal ownership is not&#13;
necessarily connected with the rise of institutionalized tourism. In Hawaii,&#13;
for instance, the control of business and land was in the hands of nonlocal&#13;
companies long before the development of tourism; in Leavenworth the influx&#13;
of outsiders into business was related to community revival, not to tourism&#13;
per se.&#13;
Competition for Local Resources&#13;
99.       The examples under the first point relate mainly to rising prices&#13;
and shortages of consumer goods for the local population during the tourist&#13;
season and the exclusion of the host population from the use of beaches. In&#13;
Bodrum the price of fish during the tourist season is three times higher than&#13;
in the nontourist season. The fishermen sell fish first to the restaurants&#13;
that serve tourists; the surplus, if any, is available for local consumption&#13;
(Packer, 91). In Sri Lanka the price of fish, also supplied to local hotels,&#13;
rose 100% between 1968 and 1972--a percentage increase far above the general&#13;
price rise (Radke et al., 97). In The Gambia the price of a bag of rice rises&#13;
during the tourist season (Esh &amp; Rosenblum, 28). In Mykonos the cafes are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
crowded during the tourist season and residents can find it difficult to get&#13;
a seat. The waterfront promenade tourist crowd makes it difficult for resi-&#13;
dents. to walk in comfort (Packer, 91; Loukissas, 73). In Fuenterrabia&#13;
tourists get the best seats for the Alarde (Greenwood, 47); in Niagara-on-&#13;
the-Lake (Canada) and Puerto Vallarta tourist cars tend to crowd out the&#13;
local residents (Doxey, 24; Evans, 29). In Hawaii the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel&#13;
has stopped local access to the beach (Tong, 114). Stopping local access to&#13;
beaches is quite common in the-Caribbean. In the Pacific Islands the growth&#13;
of recreational tourism has accelerated the decline of shallow water fish,&#13;
once part of the local diet (Johannes, 61). In Uganda regulations prohib-&#13;
iting the slaughter of animals in game parks (to preserve them for safari&#13;
tourists) have deprived local residents in and near the parks of a tradi-&#13;
tional food source without providing a substitute (Aerni, 2; Dasmann et al.,&#13;
18). These examples, which could be multiplied, point to the need for care-&#13;
ful planning and for monitoring of local impacts.&#13;
100.      The population influx into a tourism destination area could lead&#13;
to increased competition for local jobs. The migrants, generally unskilled,&#13;
are found at the lowest economic levels. They constitute an additional bur-&#13;
den on usually inadequate social services (e.g., health, education), and,&#13;
where social security schemes are in force, on the taxpayer (see Robineau,&#13;
101; Kent, 65). Migrants usually become the target of local frustrations&#13;
and fears.&#13;
101.      LeFevre writes that "it is not unusual to detect some bias toward&#13;
tourist-related facilities and away from the more general need" (LeFevre,&#13;
70:105). Fukunaga (42) suggests that investment in agriculture rather than&#13;
tourism in North Kohala would better sustain development. Perez (94) believes&#13;
that expenditures to augment police forces, marketing, hotel training&#13;
schools, construction of roads, and extension of airports to support&#13;
tourism might be more economically spent on projects designed to assist the&#13;
local population directly. It should be noted, however, that in many in-&#13;
stances expenditures by the local government on infrastructure (e.g., roads&#13;
and water supply) benefit the local population. Further, this expenditure&#13;
may be necessary even without tourism and is often carried out under "tour-&#13;
ism projects" with grants or low interest loans. There are, undoubtedly,&#13;
instances when expenditures for infrastructure have not benefited the local&#13;
population. In Mykonos, for instance, the new water supply was made avail-&#13;
able to a hotel and offered to passing yachts rather than to the local&#13;
population that desperately needed it (Loukissas, 73). It is also necessary&#13;
to consider whether tourism provides the most efficient means of earning&#13;
revenue that permits a country to attain its development objectives. Tourism&#13;
may involve a temporary diversion of resources from objects of direct bene-&#13;
fit to the local population. Earning money from tourism as part of a develop-&#13;
ment strategy and initial expenditures for that purpose are not necessarily&#13;
irrational or immoral.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
Impact on Women&#13;
102.      Evidence that tourism affects the position of women is growing.&#13;
Probably the most dramatic evidence is Cottington's study of female hotel&#13;
employees in Hawaii, referred to by Fukunaga (42). Hotel employment gave&#13;
women in Hawaii economic opportunity and consequent independence. Men often&#13;
continued to work on the plantation; the women worked a forty-hour shift at&#13;
the hotel. Cottington has suggested that the evidence that tourism employ-&#13;
ment increased divorces among women surveyed is inadequate. The decline in&#13;
marital stability must be viewed against a background of previous patterns&#13;
where women were generally confined to the home and their contacts limited&#13;
to relatives. Probably, the movement of women out of the house simply aggra-&#13;
vated preexisting marital strife. A later study by Smith,' though not repre-&#13;
sentative, indicates that after an initial transition period many women&#13;
experience an increased sense of identity and self-worth from tourism employ-&#13;
ment. For Indo-Fijian women tourism hotel employment is usually their first&#13;
wage employment. In The Gambia women are not generally employed in hotels,&#13;
though employing women is a matter left to the discretion of the department&#13;
head in each hotel (Esh &amp; Rosenblum, 28). In Mykonos women have gone out&#13;
and bargained with tourists who needed accommodation; hotel employment has&#13;
also permitted greater contact with fellow employees and tourists and become&#13;
an additional source of income. Apparently women have not been frequently&#13;
employed by hotels in Bodrum or in Morocco. A recent study (Kennedy et al.,&#13;
64) of the impact of tourism on the role and status of women provides impor-&#13;
tant evidence on the effects of the introduction of "institutionalization."&#13;
In Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo (Mexico) the formalization of roles through the crea-&#13;
tion of specific organizations to represent the population and provide a&#13;
channel for expressing views provided mainly for male representation; women,&#13;
who had played a significant role in informal organizations (particularly in&#13;
neighborhood associations), were excluded from participation in the newly&#13;
created organizations. The exclusion does not appear to have been deliberate;&#13;
it happened because the developers imposed their own (Western) cultural back-&#13;
ground on the design of the organizations--the case with many development&#13;
projects. The researchers found that tourism did increase economic oppor-&#13;
tunities for young unmarried women; married women, however, still had to&#13;
contend against cultural prohibitions against work outside the home.&#13;
103.      The preceding examples indicate that tourism does not have a uni-&#13;
form impact on women in different countries. Whether or not women gain&#13;
directly from tourism is largely a matter of the culture of host populations.&#13;
For example, in North Kohala the changed position of women could be explained&#13;
by reference to the dominant values in American culture which stress both&#13;
equality and self-determination. Tourism was a catalyst for the attainment&#13;
of these values. The most frequent area in which women gain economically&#13;
from tourism is in the realm of handicrafts. But the evidence of increased&#13;
freedom or economic independence is inadequate, because it is unclear who&#13;
determines when, and if, a woman should work--males or females--and who&#13;
controls income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
Migration&#13;
104.      One result of tourism is to reduce migration, particularly migra-&#13;
tion of the young (and, often, best educated) from small towns and rural&#13;
areas to urban centers. Examples of destination areas that experienced&#13;
reduced migration abound--Leavenworth, Mykonos, and Bodrum (Packer, 91);&#13;
North Kohala (Fukunaga, 42); Colpied and La Roche (Reiter, 98). A signi-&#13;
ficant amount of tourism development commences in relatively economically&#13;
underdeveloped areas. Tourism provides additional opportunities for the&#13;
local population and thereby lowers the migration rate.&#13;
Nutrition, Health, Education, and Welfare&#13;
105.      Consensus is that tourism improves nutrition standards.     In&#13;
Fuenterrabia (Greenwood, 46), Mykonos (Packer, 91), Antigua (Joshi &amp; Sharp-&#13;
ston, 62), Barbados (Doxey &amp; Associates, 25), Tonga (Urbanowicz, 119), Fiji&#13;
(Robineau, 101), and Tahiti (LeFevre, 71) dietary intakes have increased as&#13;
incomes have risen and more consumer goods have become available. Beef in-&#13;
take has increased among Mykonians. In North Kohala the rising median income&#13;
resulting from tourism has spawned the growth of supermarkets, the provision&#13;
of credit, and a wide range of consumer expenditures (particularly on furni-&#13;
ture and TV sets). Contributing to the growth of consumer expenditures is&#13;
the growth in the number of women working, mainly in the tourism industry&#13;
(see Fukunaga, 42).&#13;
106.      Data on the impact of tourism on health are fewer than&#13;
data on the impact of tourism on nutrition. Joshi and Sharpston suggest&#13;
that tourism may have introduced certain strains of influenza and venereal&#13;
disease to Antigua. Journalists (notably West, 119, and Turner &amp; Ash, 115)&#13;
have indicated that tourism can be linked with a decline in standards of&#13;
health. On the other hand tourism has improved health standards in Los&#13;
Santos, according to Moore (83); there, the Swedes insisted on, and intro-&#13;
duced, better standards of hygiene and health. Health facilities have in-&#13;
creased, according to Evans (25). The evidence on tourism and health does&#13;
not, therefore, permit general conclusions.&#13;
107.      The evidence suggests that tourism has an indirect impact on&#13;
education. Tourism contributes to rises in income that allow families to&#13;
achieve some of their goals; education is one of the most important goals.&#13;
In places like Mykonos, Bodrum, North Kohala, and Los Santos education for&#13;
the young is becoming a reality. Cultural values undoubtedly dictate which&#13;
sex is more likely to be educated--in Bodrum, for instance, education is&#13;
more easily available for boys than girls--but there is a general trend&#13;
towards increasing education of both sexes. Tourism has also led to hotel&#13;
training projects; 11% of all hotel employees interviewed by Esh and Rosen-&#13;
blum in-The Gambia (28) had taken a United Nations Development Program&#13;
hotel 'training course.&#13;
108.      Data showing the impact of tourism on such services as water,&#13;
electricity, and roads and on political participation are meagre. Improve-&#13;
ments in sanitation and hygiene, originally made for tourists, have also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
been used by local residents. How far these improvements have spread, how-&#13;
ever, is a matter of doubt. New roads in Bodrum are used by the local popu-&#13;
lation--but the decision to build them was made prior to the growth of tour-&#13;
ism.&#13;
109.      A common charge against tourism is that it increases crime, delin-&#13;
quency, and prostitution. Journalists frequently refer to this topic (see&#13;
Esh &amp; Rosenblum, 28; Turner &amp; Ash, 115). The correlation between tourism and&#13;
crime and delinquency is said to be particularly high when the tourists are&#13;
substantially wealthier than the host population. The Caribbean is most&#13;
often singled out as a destination where crime and delinquency have grown.&#13;
But there, as in many other areas, the causes of increased crime need to be&#13;
more carefully assessed. They may be related to high unemployment, poor&#13;
housing, the inability to plan for the next day, stark poverty, and cultural&#13;
history. The tourist is often the focus of crime, rather than the cause.&#13;
Two additional questions need to be answered: (a) How many crimes are com-&#13;
mitted against fellow citizens (rather than tourists)? (b) Have crimes&#13;
actually increased, or have crime statistics been improved? Fukunaga, who&#13;
believes tourism contributes to increased crime and delinquency, presents&#13;
statistics that actually show a comparative decrease in crime with the growth&#13;
of tourism--attributed to the "cultural integrity" of the local population&#13;
in North Kohala. Population increases may require replacing informal with&#13;
formal methods of control (see Forster, 37).&#13;
110.      Some tourists undoubtedly seek prostitutes.    The demand for prosti-&#13;
tutes may be related to the type of tourism and tourists. It is necessary&#13;
to identify the occasions and areas in which this demand is most likely to&#13;
occur and to regulate prostitution. It would also be useful to investigate&#13;
who owns the brothels (residents or outsiders) and what percentage of patrons&#13;
are tourists.&#13;
Distribution of Benefits&#13;
111.      Economic and political interests often shape the growth and&#13;
development of tourism. Political factors frequently determine the type of&#13;
tourism that will be fostered--and even the location of tourist resorts.&#13;
Kjellstrom (66) points out that the city of Fez (Morocco) was chosen for&#13;
tourism development to cater to the politically important Fassi. Another&#13;
concession to the Fassi was the grant of a capital subsidy to the Rabat-&#13;
Hilton in excess of government's own standards regarding capital subsidy.&#13;
In Bodrum the economically powerful foreigners in Izmir are buying up land&#13;
and planning their own schemes for resorts; the same is the case in Moorea,&#13;
an island a short distance away from Papeete (Tahiti). But to admit that&#13;
powerful economic and political interests have a way of diverting develop-&#13;
ment to serve their own purposes is not to support the suggestion of Sanchez&#13;
that tourism crystallizes or freezes existing layering of society. There is&#13;
evidence (for example, in Bodrum, Leavenworth, and Los Santos) that tourism&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
creates new layers, introduces outsiders into existing strata, and results&#13;
in new criteria for prestige. From the meagre evidence available, however,&#13;
it is difficult to generalize about the effects of tourism on social strati-&#13;
fication.&#13;
112.      Finally, there is very little evidence as to how incomes from&#13;
tourism are distributed among families or relatives.     Does tourism encourage&#13;
the avoidance of traditional obligations of support? In The Gambia (Esh &amp;&#13;
Rosenblum, 28) an! Bali (Noronha, 86) this does not seem to be the case.&#13;
One of the major sources of income from tourism in Bali is traditional group&#13;
performances; this situation reinforces obligations to the traditional social&#13;
group. It is suggested that in Bodrum, Mvkonos, and Fuenterrabia, tourism&#13;
has encouraged intergenerational-conflict, particularly among-youths who&#13;
attained economic independence. It is uncertain, however, whether tourism&#13;
created new cultural values or merely facilitated the attainment of existing&#13;
values in the wider society over the past half century. Western civiliza-&#13;
tion has shown an increasing trend towards individualism, self-determination,&#13;
and the nuclear family as socially approved values.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

VII. THE IMPACT OF TOURISM:&#13;
PART II - SOCIOCULTURAL&#13;
113.      This chapter evaluates the impact of tourism on art and handi-&#13;
crafts, architecture, archaeology, dance, and festivals; it also discusses&#13;
the "commercialization" of culture.&#13;
Art and Handicrafts&#13;
114.      Studies generally agree that tourism has helped preserve jobs for&#13;
artists and artisans and revive, preserve, and diversify art and handicrafts.&#13;
Deitch (19) says that "the Indian arts of the Southwest (United' States) are&#13;
an example of one instance when the coming of the white man did not destroy&#13;
something native. Rather, the contact with Anglo society heightened and in&#13;
certain instances revived old traditions" (19:15). The jewelry and rings&#13;
produced by the Navajo have improved in quality with the advent of to'urism;&#13;
new designs are now used by this tribe as well as by the Hopi and Zuni.&#13;
Production has diversified into silver platters and decorative cigarette&#13;
boxes. Women were encouraged to continue rug weaving, and new media were&#13;
introduced. Old forgotten designs were traced and revived by museums and&#13;
archaeologists. The recent manufacture of handicrafts by two companies in&#13;
the Cook Islands appears to have good prospects of sale to tourists (LeFevre,&#13;
70). In Mykonos, Packer (91) says, tourist demand for traditional sweaters&#13;
and wool items originally produced for home consumption has created a new&#13;
market. With the assistance of the Mykonos Agricultural Cooperative new&#13;
styles, new materials, and new techniques are now being used; knitting and&#13;
crochetting are common. These items add to the income of those (mainly&#13;
women) who produce them. Kjellstrom, however, suggests that it is:&#13;
"incorrect to talk about job creation due to tourism in (the&#13;
area of handicrafts); job retention would be a more appropri-&#13;
ate term. The demand emanating from tourism could be most&#13;
helpful in smoothing what might otherwise have been a brutal&#13;
transitional process with much job dislocation in handicrafts&#13;
due to increasing modernization of the Moroccan economy. The&#13;
artisans are carrying on a long artistic tradition of pro-&#13;
ducing delightful items for ornamental purposes as well as&#13;
utilitarian goods for everyday life.... With no tourism in&#13;
Morocco, several branches of handicrafts would have languished&#13;
into relative obscurity instead of experiencing the rather&#13;
buoyant demand of today..." (66:281-283).&#13;
May (76) tentatively agrees that tourism has helped to preserve traditional&#13;
art in Papua New Guinea.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
115.      But what sort of art does tourism encourage?   Is it the "airport&#13;
art" bought by visitors to the Polynesian Cultural Centre in Hawaii "prob-&#13;
ably because of uneducated tastes" (McGrevy, 78:23)? It has been suggested&#13;
that institutionalized tourism and the institutionalized tourist's demand&#13;
for souvenirs encourage the entry of fakes and lower the general quality and&#13;
standards of art (Udayana University, 116).&#13;
,116.      May (76) has examined this question in a study of Papua New Guinea.&#13;
He places art in Papua New Guinea on a continuum from "true traditional art"&#13;
through "pseudo traditional art" to "wholly introduced art forms." Of the&#13;
first type are those works which, without regard to aesthetic quality, are&#13;
"made within a traditional society for use--religious or secular--within&#13;
that society or for trade with traditional trading partners" (76:125).&#13;
Works in the second category (which includes airport art) are usually mass&#13;
produced by persons who have no knowledge of traditional culture and are&#13;
often not members of the society whose art they pretend to exemplify. The&#13;
third category is neither traditional nor imitation art.' Examples in Papua&#13;
New Guinea, are tapa handbags and the work of individual creative artists.&#13;
'May believes that the tourist does something between depriving a nation of&#13;
its treasures and encouraging art preservation. But the tourist has also&#13;
encouraged the development of pseudo traditional art, particularly airport&#13;
art, faking, and the "bastardization of traditional art" (76:127). By&#13;
"bastardization" May means adapting traditional objects to foreign tastes or&#13;
needs--for instance, reducing shields and houseboards to suitcase size.&#13;
Tourists know little about traditional art in Papua New Guinea and are there-&#13;
fore less likely than collectors, administrators, and missionaries to assist&#13;
in depriving the nation of its treasures. On the other hand, tourism does&#13;
little to assist the plastic arts, according to May, because the tourist is&#13;
a one-shot buyer; he generally buys souvenirs that capture the spirit of&#13;
the place or are amusing and are small and inexpensive.&#13;
117.      May maintains that the growth of pseudo traditional art in Papua&#13;
New Guinea represents a general decline in artistic standards. But McKean&#13;
(80) points out that in Bali a range of art works are still being produced--&#13;
some atrocious in style and quality, others excellent. The former are often&#13;
produced as potboilers. The appreciation of any work of art is largely a&#13;
matter of taste; its beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. Therefore,&#13;
while purists will carp about declining standards, can any art that serves&#13;
a function be criticized strongly on aesthetic grounds?&#13;
Architecture&#13;
118.      Tourism has influenced architecture in several destination areas.&#13;
In Mykonos and Bodrum, architects have imitated the fashionable architecture&#13;
in the capital cities of Athens and Izmir. After the town of Fuenterrabia&#13;
was designated an area of national cultural importance, the city walls were&#13;
renovated and the fishermens' quarter, where most of the tourists congregate,&#13;
rebuilt. Leavenworth adopted an Alpine theme for new downtown architecture,&#13;
but the new architecture is more closely related to the town's attempt to&#13;
revive itself than to tourism (Packer, 91).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
Archaeology&#13;
119.      The growth of tourism in Mykonos can be partly attributed to the&#13;
fact that the island of Delos is only three miles away.     Greek and Roman&#13;
antiquities found on the sea bed first stimulated tourist interest in Bodrum.&#13;
Today an underwater Archaeological Museum and the restored Castle of St.&#13;
Peter are tourist attractions. In Bali contributions by-tourists are par-&#13;
tially support the cost of maintaining temples and monuments. But tourists&#13;
there are also accused of exporting archaeological treasures (Udayana Uni-&#13;
versity, 116).&#13;
The "Commercialization" of Culture&#13;
120.      Forster (37) and Cohen.(13) speak of the "commercialization" of&#13;
culture; Greenwood (47) uses the term "commoditization." The terms, which&#13;
are interchangeable, refer to performing traditional spectacles and rituals&#13;
(e.g., ceremonial dances) or producing traditional objects for money. What&#13;
the local population formerly did as a matter of spontaneous obligation, or&#13;
ritual, is now performed for the visitor for reward. "Commercialization"&#13;
includes the. revival of lost, forgotten, or abandoned ceremonies--for example,&#13;
the dances of Hawaii or Tahiti and the financially successful Polynesian&#13;
Cultural Centre. Forster (37,) has called this aspect of commercialization&#13;
the development of a "phony-folk culture."&#13;
121.      Commercialization and development of phony-folk culture is said&#13;
to have several consequences:&#13;
(a)  debasement of-the ceremony in the eyes of the host population&#13;
by transferring it to the secular realm;&#13;
(b)  anomie when the transfer is not replaced by other values;&#13;
(c)  commercialization of aspects of local culture deemed important&#13;
by tourism promoters and not necessarily important to the&#13;
host population;&#13;
(d)  standardization of ceremonies;&#13;
(e)  degradation of the host population by using performers who&#13;
do not share the host's cultural background and by asking the&#13;
hosts to act "as they were" rather than as they are.&#13;
122.      Greenwood uses the Alarde to illustrate the dangers of cultural&#13;
commoditization.   Before the advent of institutionalized tourism, he says,&#13;
this annual celebration of the defense of Fuenterrabia against the French was&#13;
the focal point of community identity and unity. With the advent of mass&#13;
tourists, the Spanish national authorities decided that the celebration should&#13;
be performed twice on the same day (for the benefit of the tourists). The&#13;
result was that Fuenterrabians were no longer willing to take part in the&#13;
celebrations. They felt that the event had lost all meaning. Greenwood&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
(47) does not specify whether the resentment of the Fuenterrabians was caused&#13;
by the failure of the national government to consult them or the failure of&#13;
the tourists to appreciate the importance of the occasion. May (76) offers&#13;
another example: He believes that the mass production of pseudo traditional&#13;
art in Papua New Guinea "has been partly the result of breaking the link&#13;
between the art and its traditional religious or secular function in the&#13;
society..." (76:126).&#13;
123.      Other examples refute Greenwood's view, however.     The Balinese&#13;
have not been affected by performing dances of sacred origin for tourists&#13;
(see McKean, 79, 80). Deitch (19) says that the "kachina" (a wooden figure&#13;
symbolizing a supernatural spirit mediator between the Pueblo people and&#13;
their gods) is modified for sale to nontribals, thus maintaining a distinc-&#13;
tion between the religious purpose of the kachina and the needs of collec-&#13;
tors. Swain (111) indicates that the "Mola" (a traditional blouse worn by&#13;
Cuna women of San Blas) has become both a focal point of ethnic identity and&#13;
a successful commercial product. Evans provides another example: In&#13;
Puerto Vallarta the holiday of the patron saint has taken on a commercial&#13;
quality, but it has also been extended "from a two to a twelve-day celebra-&#13;
tion" in which thousands participate, "many in neighborhood-planned perfor-&#13;
mances and costumes" (29:196). The final example is taken from Micronesia.&#13;
Ashman reports that when a woman objected to commercializing sacred dances&#13;
for tourists, another, older woman replied "that dancing for money has&#13;
several redeeming benefits. Among them, it would renew interest in learning&#13;
the traditional dances.... Dancing for pay would give (the young) an incen-&#13;
tive to learn, would give them spending money which parents cannot provide,&#13;
and would keep them busy during otherwise idle hours when they might get&#13;
into mischief" (5:139). These are examples where tourism fostered&#13;
identity; the sacred was not debased (or secularized) by tourism, and a&#13;
distinction was maintained between the sacred and the secular.&#13;
124.      Thus, the "packaging" of cultural events for tourists does not&#13;
inevitably debase the event. Loss of control, not loss of meaning,&#13;
explains the reaction of the Fuenterrabian population toward performing the&#13;
Alarde twice a day. The Balinese, Hopi, and Cuna maintain a distinction&#13;
between the sacred and the secular that prevents debasement of their culture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
VIII. PLANNING&#13;
125.      The previous chapters have provided examples of the effects of&#13;
tourism with and without planned tourism development. The extremes are&#13;
Leavenworth and Mykonos. In Leavenworth planning was an essential element of&#13;
the town's development. The population reaps the benefits of tourism with-&#13;
out adverse social impacts. Mykonos, on the other hand, has become a "sac-&#13;
rificial lamb to tourism." There, tourism development has been entirely&#13;
unplanned, economic forces have been left to work without restraint, and&#13;
negative social effects have been widespread. The Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo proj-&#13;
ect is an example of the failure of planners to take into account the in-&#13;
formal roles of women in the host economy; the effects of the plans were to&#13;
further lower the economic status of the poorest *sections. Those who had&#13;
lived for years on inalienable land (under the belief that they had bought&#13;
it legally) were not only dispossessed, but also excluded from health and&#13;
education services introduced under the project (see Kennedy et al., 64).&#13;
While most authors agree on the need to plan for tourism development, the&#13;
literature provides inadequate information about selection of goals, indices,&#13;
and weights; type and levels of planning; formulation of plans', with local&#13;
participation, based on a choice of alternatives (including types of tour-&#13;
ists); development of backward linkages (local resources that support the&#13;
development of tourism--for example, beef production to supply meat to ho-&#13;
tels); and determination of the destination's "carrying capacity."&#13;
Before discussing the elements of planning, it is necessary to dis-&#13;
pose of one question: Is it really necessary to pay attention to the soci-&#13;
ological consequences of tourism? The question may seem trite, yet Gearing,&#13;
Swart, and Var suggest that "the question of tourism's sociological impact&#13;
is essentially academic" when "the tourist industry may appear to be the&#13;
only available alternative for development" (43:32). This view runs counter&#13;
to the evidence of the social impact of tourism in areas where tourism is&#13;
the major method of development: Hawaii and the Caribbean.&#13;
Calvo (11) and Joshi and Sharpston (62) correctly point out that in most&#13;
instances the sociological consequences of tourism can be foreseen and moni-&#13;
tored and the negative impacts softened by careful investigation of socio-&#13;
cultural patterns of the destination area.&#13;
In most destination areas tourism has developed spontaneously and&#13;
therefore planning seems to have been an afterthought.     Only at a later&#13;
stage (generally the end of Stage II) has the necessity for planning been&#13;
realized. And at this stage the only type of planning possibly may be&#13;
"therapeutic" (Doxey, 24)--remedial planning to reduce negative impacts that&#13;
have already arisen. Unfortunately, in many instances (for instance, in&#13;
Fuenterrabia, Puerto Vallarta, Los Santos, and Bodrum) planning has only&#13;
speeded up the transition to Stage III and given rise to even greater social&#13;
problems than the plans attempted to solve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
128.       In some cases tourism development may be entirely planned.    The&#13;
national government may, for instance, determine that institutionalized&#13;
tourism is the type that will provide the greatest foreign exchange earnings&#13;
and decide to induce tourism rather than wait for spontaneous development.&#13;
The discussion that follows applies both to spontaneous and induced tourism&#13;
development.&#13;
129.      Planning involves:&#13;
(a) selecting goals and developing policy;&#13;
(b) selecting and weighting social indices;&#13;
(c) weighing alternatives (e.g., alternative types of tourism);&#13;
(d) determining the pace of tourism development;&#13;
(e) creating backward linkages; and&#13;
(f) providing for local participation.&#13;
130.      Planning is done at several levels and in several stages.     At the&#13;
earliest stages selecting goals is important (see Kjellstrom, 66; Doxey,&#13;
24). The goals of most countries are to raise living standards, increase&#13;
equitable distribution, and provide for disadvantaged sections. These are&#13;
general goals which must be made tourism-specific. At the national level&#13;
plans should include policy--the strategy for attaining the goals.&#13;
131.      Developing policy requires chosing and weighting social indices.&#13;
The indices will assist in the selection of alternative strategies and tour-&#13;
ism development proposals. An example of the factors to be considered are&#13;
set out in Doctoroff's (22) article. The literature on the development of&#13;
social indices is inadequate, however, because efforts to develop social in-&#13;
dices have been attempted only within the past decade and because social in-&#13;
dices must be related to the goals of each country's plans; these plans&#13;
differ.&#13;
132.      Tourism planning should consider alternative strategies for&#13;
development (e.g., tourism versus industrialization--see Kloke, 67), alter-&#13;
nate geographical areas to develop through tourism, and alternative types&#13;
of tourists and tourism to encourage. Choosing a destination area requires&#13;
information about sociocultural patterns and the probable impact of tourism&#13;
and the creation of monitoring units. In addition, the impact of tourism&#13;
is related to the type of tourism; choosing the type of tourism, in turn,&#13;
requires an assessment of the facilities needed, the nature of the tourism&#13;
encounter, and the local resources. For example, planners may decide to&#13;
foster institutionalized tourism because of the proximity of a major market,&#13;
the tourist's desire for "sun and sand," the presence of beaches within the&#13;
destination area, and the likelihood that the minimum contact between tourist&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
and host that this type of tourism involves will result in the least disrup'-&#13;
tion of local culture. On the other hand, the choice must be weighed against&#13;
the fact that institutionalized tourism requires the greatest local adjust-&#13;
ments and can give rise to local resentment. Choosing the type of tourism&#13;
to foster also requires an assessment of the role of government in tourism.&#13;
LeFevre (71) points out, for instance, that governments that do not have&#13;
the resources to develop and manage institutionalized tourism should consider&#13;
how they can direct the foreign exchange earnings from tourism to policies&#13;
that help develop a local capacity to manage tourism.&#13;
133.      The last point is related to the creation of backward linkages.&#13;
Kanellakis suggests that tourism is not a viable method of economic develop-&#13;
ment of Greece since it is a service industry with no backward linkages.&#13;
Kjellstrom (66) agrees that tourism is basically a service industry and adds&#13;
that "basic industries with limited outlets [e.g., hotels and other tourist&#13;
facilities] are not likely to be viable." However, Kjellstrom accepts the&#13;
necessity for developing backward linkages which could enlarge "local mar-&#13;
kets for several products, sometimes even beyond the critical threshhold&#13;
level" (66:126). The present evidence is that institutionalized tourism&#13;
rarely provides these backward linkages, and the lack of planning combined&#13;
with import incentives continues this (see Esh &amp; Rosenblum, 28; Joshi &amp;&#13;
Sharpston, 62). In Sri Lanka Radke et al. (97) found no development impact&#13;
on the villages that supplied goods to the tourist hotels. They conclude&#13;
that "the way in which hotels are embedded in their traditional surrounding&#13;
is much more important (than) the absolute number of tourists" (97:19).&#13;
134.      Determining the pace of tourism development is essential.     Joshi&#13;
&amp; Sharpston (62) and Greenwood (46) conclude that the problems of Antigua&#13;
and Fuenterrabia, respectively, are the result of too rapid a pace of un-&#13;
planned tourism development. This conclusion can be expressed in another&#13;
way--each tourist destination area has a definite "absorptive" or "carrying&#13;
capacity" (a term popularized by environmentalists). Dasmann, Milton, and&#13;
Freeman define "carrying capacity" as "a measure of the number of individuals&#13;
of any species that a particular environment can support" (18:33). They&#13;
recognize that different types of tourism demand different types of facili-&#13;
ties. Probably the most reasonable observations on "carrying capacity" (and&#13;
optimum numbers) were expressed by Belt Collins &amp; Associates Limited and&#13;
Others (6) when they opined that the exercise is justifiable only if tourism&#13;
is the sole economic base. When tourism is not the sole economic base, the&#13;
host country has so many other variables to take into account that the exer-&#13;
cise is meaningless. The variables include: socioeconomic differences be-&#13;
tween residents and visitors, type and location of visitor accommodation,&#13;
and degree to which the local residents receive the benefits and control&#13;
tourism investment and management. But even they agree that it would be a&#13;
useful exercise to estimate the number of visitors at any one time (not a&#13;
total for the year) in relation to the local population. More important to&#13;
carrying capacity than the ratio of tourists to hosts are the type of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
tourists, the extent of local skills and facilities, the number of tourists&#13;
in relation to the preceding two items, and local residents' needs for&#13;
touristic and recreational assets. These factors should be taken into&#13;
account when formulating plans.&#13;
135.      There is general agreement that local participation in plan formu-&#13;
lation and execution is essential. Fox (38), for instance, believes that&#13;
the best plans are those formulated in partnership with the people concerned&#13;
but sets out only general preconditions for this:&#13;
(a) sufficient information on which to make intelligent choices;&#13;
(b) participation in arriving at the goals of tourism;&#13;
(c) opportunity to help formulate criteria for measuring progress&#13;
towards the goals; and&#13;
(d) sufficient involvement with planning and decisionmaking.&#13;
Calvo (11) is more specific. She recommends greater involvement in the&#13;
planning, control, and development of the tourism sector in order to achieve&#13;
harmonious growth of that sector in relation to local culture; integration&#13;
of tourism with other sectors; protection of physical resources; review of&#13;
incentives and taxation system; redistribution of gains; and utilization of&#13;
gains for training and research. Both Fox and Calvo are in effect discussing&#13;
the general elements of planning.&#13;
136.      Local participation has been attempted in only a few instances.&#13;
Two cases of successful participation are Leavenworth and the Great Smoky&#13;
Mountains National Park Project (Falk &amp; Brodie, 31). Both examples are from&#13;
a developed country. Local participation may be more complex and time con-&#13;
suming when a large percentage of the affected and "impacted" (to use Falk &amp;&#13;
Brodie's term) population is dispersed and illiterate. It is in this area&#13;
that sociologists can assist; they can help identify traditional decision-&#13;
makers and decisionmaking organizations--the formal and informal channels of&#13;
communication to local residents. To deny that local residents have opinions&#13;
and are capable of involvement is to deny their humanity.&#13;

IX. AN END AND A BEGINNING&#13;
137.      This chapter comrnents generally on the literature, enumerates topics&#13;
for further investigation, and makes recommendations that have practical im-&#13;
plications for Bank operations.&#13;
A.   General Observations on the Literature&#13;
138.      There is widespread ambivalence in the sociological literature&#13;
about tourism as a strategy for economic development. On the one hand, the&#13;
changes attributed to tourism--particularly the negative changes--are deplored&#13;
and there is an underlying feeling that people in the destination area should&#13;
be "kept as they are." On the other hand, there is a grudging admission that&#13;
in many cases tourism is the only viable means of promoting economic develop-&#13;
ment. In reality, change is inevitable, and the goals and hopes of the host&#13;
population should play the most important role in determining the direction&#13;
of change and the means by which this can be attained.&#13;
139.      The literature does not assess whether the alleged changes attrib-&#13;
uted to tourism are peculiar to tourism or whether they also accompany indus-&#13;
trialization and other modernization processes. There is no true comparative&#13;
study available to throw light on this question. However, a study by Joshi&#13;
&amp; Sharpston (62) of the impact of tourism on Antigua is apposite. These&#13;
authors believe that the changes resulting from tourism would have taken&#13;
place with the development of any other leading sector.&#13;
140.      Assuming that tourism results in "modernization," the literature&#13;
does not clearly assess whether the transition from the "traditional" to the&#13;
"modern" involves changes in social structure, attitudes, and values (i.e.,&#13;
shared goals) or changes in social structure and attitudes alone. In other&#13;
words, does the host population change its goals as it modernizes, or does&#13;
it merely reassess the methods by which it attains its goals? The "modern"/&#13;
"traditional" dichotomy is currently undergoing agonizing reappraisal.&#13;
141.      Accepting that the traditional can be found in modern garb facili-&#13;
tates analyzing and understanding of the impact of tourism. A corollary to&#13;
this premise is that external aspects of modernization need not result in&#13;
cultural homogenization. As the preceding chapters have shown, few authors&#13;
have drawn a clear and convincing relationship between tourism and changes&#13;
in the host society. The impact of tourism on values is indirect and medi-&#13;
ated; it requires an accepted agent, who is not usually a tourist. As to the&#13;
theory that tourism heightens racial perceptions and conflict, preexisting&#13;
economic and sociocultural conditions have not been weighed carefully by&#13;
those who attribute racial effects to tourism.&#13;
142.      There is a good deal of theorizing about tourism as a form of eco-&#13;
nomic neocolonialism; but few have paused to consider whether, in fact, the&#13;
very process of modernization involves increasing loss of local control as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
functions formerly performed within a small traditional group are taken over&#13;
by the wider society. The very basis of modernization involves, among other&#13;
elements, mass production through economies of scale and standardization and&#13;
substitution of achievement for ascription as a test of status.&#13;
143.      One of the most important insights in the literature is that insti-&#13;
tutionalization involves a qualitative change in the character of tourism,&#13;
not merely an increase in numbers of tourists. The literature loosely employs&#13;
the term "mass" tourist to describe the type that predominates with institu-&#13;
tionalization. The more acceptable dichotomy would be "institutionalized"&#13;
and "noninstitutionalized" tourists.&#13;
144.      There is no extended comparative analysis on why tourism has a&#13;
greater impact on some societies than on others. Chapter IV postulates that&#13;
four crucial elements permit balanced growth in a tourism destination area&#13;
and enable hosts to avoid radical changes in social structure (causing possi-&#13;
ble social anomie) and loss of local control (giving rise almost inevitably&#13;
to resentment). They are:&#13;
(a)  sufficient differentiation to respond at the local level to&#13;
each step of tourism development without a redefinition of&#13;
roles;&#13;
(b)  duality of purposes and meanings--insuring that each local&#13;
event has independent meanings for the tourists and the hosts&#13;
and that the event can take place without the presence of&#13;
tourists;&#13;
(c)  strengthening of existing cultural values and supplementing&#13;
of existing occupations with the income from tourism;&#13;
(d)  formulation and execution of plans for tourism in which&#13;
local citizens participate.&#13;
It would be desirable if this postulate, based on an evaluation of the&#13;
literature, were tested.&#13;
B.   Topics for Further Investigation&#13;
145.       This section outlines some topics deserving of further research:&#13;
(a)  The most urgent area of research is the development of a&#13;
methodology for evaluating the social impact of tourism.&#13;
The value of most of the current literature is reduced by&#13;
the absence of hard data and the desire to fit facts into&#13;
a Procrustean bed of theory. The methodology could apply&#13;
to destination areas at different stages of tourism develop-&#13;
ment, take into account the significance of tourism in the&#13;
economy of the destination area, and help researchers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
evaluate what factors produce different responses to tourism&#13;
in different destination areas of like economic (level of&#13;
Development) and physical characteristics (for example, is-&#13;
lands). Other areas in need of further research include:&#13;
(b)  Tourism development through all three stages in different&#13;
destination areas. Comparative studies will add to the few&#13;
now available (e.g., Tajos, Point Gambell, Mykonos, Leaven-&#13;
worth, Tahiti) and also test the hypotheses mentioned in&#13;
paragraphs 46. - 48. and 144. Because-there is no known&#13;
timeframe within which tourism develops in a destination&#13;
area, many of these studies will undoubtedly involve recon-&#13;
struction of events or forecasting. As Smith (107) suggests,&#13;
however, many sociologists have already done fieldwork in&#13;
destination areas where tourism now flourishes. Their notes&#13;
from first and subsequent visits may contain information&#13;
that will enable them to trace the process of tourism develop-&#13;
ment. The information can be recovered without great diffi-&#13;
culty.&#13;
(c)  The comparative impact of the development of tourism and&#13;
the development of another leading sector (e.g., industry)&#13;
on a destination area. At present there are two opposing&#13;
"hunches" about the comparative impact. Joshi &amp; Sharpston&#13;
(62) believe that the impact of tourism is the same as the&#13;
impact of any other sector (also see Driever, 26) Greenwood&#13;
(46, 47), however, feels that the impact of tourism is&#13;
greater because tourism develops more rapidly and uses&#13;
people in the destination area as "objects." This dispute&#13;
could be resolved through factual studies. Suggested areas&#13;
where such studies could be conducted are Mexico, Yugoslavia,&#13;
and Turkey.&#13;
(d)  The comparative impact of institutionalized and noninstitu-&#13;
tionalized tourists on a destination area.&#13;
(e)  The influence of the physical environment of the destination&#13;
area on the type of tourists it attracts and the behavior of&#13;
tourists.&#13;
(f)  The mechanisms of distribution of tourism income with partic-&#13;
ular reference to changes in social structure, patterns of&#13;
health and nutrition, and life styles.&#13;
(g)  Patterns of migration to destination areas and the effect of&#13;
this migration on kinship ties and other social obligations.&#13;
(h)  The roles different ethnic/subcultural groups in a pluralistic&#13;
society play in constraining or promoting social change or&#13;
contact with tourists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
(i) Educational levels and wages of employees in the tourism sec-&#13;
tor compared with employees in other sectors in two develop-&#13;
ing countries with and without institutionalized tourism, in&#13;
one developing country before and after institutionalized&#13;
tourism, or in two areas within a developing country.&#13;
(j) The impact of tourism on the status of women, with particular&#13;
reference to their ability to control and utilize tourism&#13;
income.&#13;
(k) Local attitudes towards tourism/tourists at different stages&#13;
of tourism development. Why valuations of tourism change, if&#13;
at all. Whether local resentment reflects irritation with&#13;
tourists per se or causes other than tourism (for example,&#13;
loss of local control).&#13;
(1)  The changing role and status of culture brokers as tourism&#13;
develops through each stage.&#13;
(m) The impact of tourism on traditional patterns of land use,&#13;
land ownership and exploitation of marine resources.&#13;
(n) The impact of tourism education programs on host populations.&#13;
This topic has not been dealt with earlier because of lack&#13;
of data, it might be mentioned, however, that in both Barbados&#13;
and Fiji tourism education programs were planned to orient&#13;
the host population to tourists and tourism. The success of&#13;
these plans is not known.&#13;
(o) The development of social indicators.&#13;
(p) The success of tourism plans in destination areas where such&#13;
plans exist. Who has benefitted and why?&#13;
C.    The Role of the Bank in Tourism&#13;
146.      To date, the inclusion of social considerations in Bank tourism&#13;
projects has been intermittent-mainly due to the absence of a defined socio-&#13;
logical methodology to apply to projects. The literature of sociology is&#13;
replete with theorizing but lacks a generally accepted set of procedures for&#13;
the analysis of tourism. This exercise, as well as the seminar, are part of&#13;
the Bank's continuing effort to regularize the inclusion of social considera-&#13;
tions.&#13;
147.      The input and utility of sociologists will vary at each level of&#13;
Bank operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
148.      There are two limitations to Bank operations:    First, the costs of&#13;
project identification, preparation, and appraisal place minimum limits on&#13;
the amounts of loans or credits that can be made. This lower limit excludes&#13;
Bank interest in projects, however useful, that are too small. Second, the&#13;
Bank usually lends to countries where tourism has already commenced. It&#13;
generally enters at Stage II of tourism development or the transition period&#13;
between Stages II and III. This places further limitations on the extent to&#13;
which the Bank can influence tourism development in a country. Where, however,&#13;
the Bank is requested to assist in "inducing" tourism it can help the host&#13;
country formulate tourism goals, encourage local participation, and develop&#13;
local administrative and technical capacity.&#13;
149.      The Bank's work in tourism can be divided into sector studies,&#13;
project appraisal (sometimes including project identification and prepara-&#13;
tion), and project supervision. Sector studies include an overall assess-&#13;
ment of the role of tourism in the economic development of a country, an&#13;
assessment of the potential for further tourism development, a preliminary&#13;
identification of geographic areas where such further development might-take&#13;
place, and an evaluation of what the country needs (in the way of finances,&#13;
organization, marketing, research) in order to attain such development. At&#13;
this macro level, the sociologist can help provide:&#13;
(a) Assistance in developing and ranking of goals for tourism&#13;
development in the country.&#13;
(b) An assessment of the social constraints on goal attainment.&#13;
(c) Description and evaluation of social strata and their rela-&#13;
tionship to goal attainment.&#13;
(d)  A description of organizational structures (particularly&#13;
administrative and technical) in the country.&#13;
(e) Assistance in defining the type of tourism the country can&#13;
carry and should encourage and an evaluation of the means by&#13;
which tourism targets can be attained (including creating&#13;
formal organizations where necessary and strengthening exist-&#13;
ing organizations).&#13;
(f) An assessment of linkages between formal and informal social&#13;
structures.&#13;
(g) An analysis of population growth and migration patterns.&#13;
(h) Assistance in developing social indicators and methodology for&#13;
the collection and monitoring of social data.&#13;
(i) A preliminary assessment of the potential social impact of&#13;
projects in areas identified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
(j)  Periodic review to update or modify recommendations made.&#13;
(k)  Recommendations regarding the methods by which local residents&#13;
in the areas identified as suitable for further tourism&#13;
development can participate in the preparation and execution&#13;
of plans. This may involve an evaluation of the formal and&#13;
informal channels of communication and their relative strengths.&#13;
Quite often countries where sector studies are undertaken do not have tour-&#13;
ism plans. The Bank has a vital role to play in assisting plan formulation&#13;
consistent with the country's goals. The assessment of the country's needs&#13;
might give rise to projects in which technical assistance is the major com-&#13;
ponent. Areas of technical assistance could include: definition of goals&#13;
and policy; development of research and marketing strategies; development of&#13;
monitoring capacity; preparation of plans based on available resources&#13;
(physical, financial, managerial); creation of organizations that will fol-&#13;
low defined principles regarding, for instance, land use, acquisition, and&#13;
transfer; formulation of policy regarding incentives and ownership; and&#13;
analysis of alternative methods of attaining developmental goals.&#13;
150.      Projects, the second major area of the Bank's work, generally go&#13;
through a cycle of identification, preparation, and appraisal before a loan&#13;
is made.  The process involves much greater specificity than the broad out-&#13;
lines laid down in the sector studies (and in the country's plans). The&#13;
Bank should ask itself several questions before any loan is made. The most&#13;
important of these are:&#13;
(a)  Who are the target beneficiaries of the proposed project and&#13;
to what extent will they benefit?&#13;
(b)  Will the project introduce or increase institutionalized tour-&#13;
ism? If so, are there alternatives to the project such as&#13;
strengthening family hotels with technical assistance?&#13;
(c)  Will the proposed project introduce hotels that will compete&#13;
with existing hotels?&#13;
(d)  What type of tourists can the proposed destination area carry?&#13;
How does the project assist in creating the capacity to carry&#13;
these tourists? In other words, will the project diminish&#13;
local control over management of and decisions pertaining to&#13;
tourism? Are administrative and technical skills adequate&#13;
for the level of tourism planned?&#13;
(e) Will the project change patterns of ownership in the destina-&#13;
tion area, encouraging, for instance, outsiders?&#13;
(f)  What backward linkages with other sectors does the project&#13;
create or strengthen? By what methods (including training)&#13;
will these backward linkages be achieved?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
(g) What traditional (informal and formal) social organizations&#13;
exist in the destination area? How effective are they? How&#13;
can these traditional organizations be linked with project&#13;
organizations?&#13;
(h) What is the local cultural profile? How will local values&#13;
advance or hinder project execution?&#13;
(i) What are the existing means of communicating decisions and&#13;
plans? How representative are these? How can local partici-&#13;
pation be strengthened or achieved?&#13;
(j) What are local attitudes towards tourism?&#13;
(k) What are the social strata in the project area?&#13;
(1) What is the local occupational profile? What are the atti-&#13;
tudes and belief systems regarding different types of work?&#13;
(m)  How will the project affect migration patterns?    Will the&#13;
project stimulate migration and provide for persons who have&#13;
already migrated in search of employment? What provisions&#13;
will be made? Will the increased population in, or near, the&#13;
project area overburden existing community services or contrib-&#13;
ute to social deviance?&#13;
(n) Will the project deprive or curtail the use of facilities&#13;
which the local population uses or believes it had a right to&#13;
use? How can the continued right to use these facilities be&#13;
protected?&#13;
(o) What provisions does the project contain for creating or&#13;
strengthening of the ability to monitor and evaluate its impact?&#13;
151.      Sociologists can play a vital role in answering these questions.&#13;
They should, however, be brought in at an early stage (preferably identifi-&#13;
cation/preparation/preappraisal); later, projects tend to get crystallized&#13;
and the ability of a sociologist to provide a useful input is reduced.&#13;
152.      In the third major area of the Bank's work--project supervision--&#13;
sociologists can help mainly by:&#13;
(a)  assessing the impact of the project--evaluating the extent to&#13;
which the appraisal estimates and assumptions have been vali-&#13;
dated;&#13;
(b) evaluating the effectiveness of project organizations in&#13;
carrying out the work estimated at appraisal and prescribed&#13;
by the loan/credit documents;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
(c) alerting the Bank to new trends which may require alterations&#13;
in the project and in future projects.&#13;
Envoi&#13;
153.      For many developing countries tourism is an important strategy for&#13;
achieving economic development. But many countries lack the skills and the&#13;
financial ability to plan for tourism. The Bank and other international&#13;
organizations can help enable these countries to promote tourism development&#13;
consistent with their goals, maximize economic gains, and minimize&#13;
social disruption and loss of values. Evaluating alternative techniques of&#13;
goal attainment must involve a consideration of their social implications.&#13;
The participation of sociologists is, therefore, essential to the formulation,&#13;
evaluation, and implementation of tourism plans.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Tourism is a viable path to economic
            development; but many developing countries, by failing to
            plan lose control over the development of tourism. Failure
            to plan reduces the economic gains to the host country,
            results in loss of local ownership and control of tourist
            facilities, and may lead to additional adverse consequences
            (e.g., weakening of family ties, loss of land by the local
            population). The World Bank has been slow to take into
            account the social consequences of tourism; studies of
            tourism by sociologists themselves are relatively new, and
            many are unpublished. This paper, therefore, recommends
            areas for further research by sociologists, recommends steps
            the Bank can take to utilize the sociologists'
            perspective in tourism projects, and offers insight into the
            social consequences of tourism and how to mitigate the
            negative effects.
