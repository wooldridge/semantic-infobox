            Sustainable telecenters : a guide for
            government policy
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            For at least a decade, governments and
            non-profit organizations, often supported by bilateral aid,
            have experimented with tele-centers as means to extend
            access to computers, the Internet, and other information,
            and communication services to rural, and low-income urban
            areas of developing countries. Results have been mixed. This
            note proposes a guide for government policy on tele-centers
            conceived as private businesses - though with development
            functions - that are commercially sustainable beyond initial
            public support.
