The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of Agreement of the&#13;
International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits its recommendation pursuant to&#13;
said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association extend to the Republic of Kenya an additional&#13;

additional funds to supplement the financial assistance furnished by the Association under the Financing&#13;
Agreement, dated July 5, 2010 and February 10, 2012 respectively, both between the Republic of Kenya and&#13;
the Association, for Health Sector Support Project, the objectives of which are to support Kenya's Health&#13;
Sector Program and improve: (i) the delivery of quality essential health and nutrition services and utilization&#13;
by women and children, especially among the poor and drought affected populations; and (ii) the&#13;
effectiveness of planning, financing, and procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.&#13;
1.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to extend such an additional&#13;
financing, and of the purpose to which the proceeds of the additional financing are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project in support of which the proceeds of such additional&#13;
financing are to be applied continues to come within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I&#13;
of said Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
Republic of Kenya and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of the Republic of Kenya.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said project continues to merit financial assistance from the&#13;
Association, and hereby recommends said project for such additional assistance.&#13;
