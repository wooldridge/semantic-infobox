1.     THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
I .    Since the start of the ERP, the Government of Ghana (GoG) has, under vanrous donor-&#13;
funded programs, sought to improve its financial management. Under the Structural Adjustment&#13;
Institutional Support Project (SAIS)' which accompanied and complemented the Bank's first&#13;
Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC I), progress was made in, among other areas, external debt&#13;
management, tax administration, and policy analysis. The Economic Management Support&#13;
Project (EMS), which was approved by the Board in 1991, further sought improvements in&#13;
budgeting, auditing, expenditure reporting, and tax administration. In particular, it supported the&#13;
introduction of an Integrated Personnel and Payroll Database (IPPD) which linked personnel&#13;
information to payroll and allowed for the automated processing of the Government payroll and&#13;
analysis of personnel information. The Debt Recording and Management System (DRMS),&#13;
developed by the Commonwealth Secretariat, was installed and operationalized in the Aid and Debt&#13;
Management Unit (ADMU) of the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Ghana (BoG), and the&#13;
Controller and Accountant-General's Department (CAGD). Customs administration was improved&#13;
through the introduction of the Automated System for Customs Database (ASYCUDA) which was&#13;
extended to the primary ports. The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FINSAC) has addressed&#13;
institutional strengthening of the Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICA) and the banking sector&#13;
by the introduction of accounting standards through the Ghana Accounting Standards Board and of&#13;
new legislation improving financial reporting supervision on the part of the BoG. It has also&#13;
supported a diagnostic study of the Audit Service which has come up with recommendations on&#13;
enhancing the capabilities of the Audit Service. However, these efforts were of a piece-meal nature&#13;
and were not guided by the requirements of an integrated financial management system.&#13;
2.     The Government is now committed to implanting an integrated financial management&#13;
system in the country. The motivation for this is from three sources. First, better financial&#13;
management is critical to effective macroeconomic management and outcomes, particularly in an&#13;
era of uncertain donor flows. Second, with Ghana adopting a democratic government since 1992,&#13;
higher levels of accountability are perceived as critical to consolidating and sustaining the&#13;
democratic process. The 1992 Constitution has set the framework for greater participation of&#13;
citizens in society and has specifically defined the roles and responsibilities of the judicial,&#13;
legislative and executive arms of Government to create the basis for maintaining the necessary set&#13;
of checks and balances essential to a democratic society. Third, effective financial management,&#13;
particularly at the decentralized local level, is a pre-condition to the implementation of the&#13;
Government's decentralization program which is embedded in the Constitution.&#13;
B.    Detailed Project Description&#13;
3.    The Project will develop an integrated public financial management system in Ghana. This&#13;
is an inter-related set of sub-systems which plans, processes, and reports upon financial resources,&#13;
covers a broad spectrum of financial management areas, and is computer-based. The principal&#13;
factor which "integrates" the system is a common, reliable, unified database to, and from which, all&#13;
financial data flows and which is shared by all the financial users.&#13;
1   Approved in 1987 and closed in 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
4.     The Project will support the development of eight critical components or sub-systems (the&#13;
shaded boxes in Chart 1): (i) the budget preparation sub-system; (ii) the budget implementation&#13;
sub-system; (iii) the accounting sub-system; (iv) the cash management sub-system; (v) the aid and&#13;
debt management sub-system; (vi) the revenue sub-system; (vii) the procurement sub-system; and&#13;
(viii) the auditing sub-system. Even though these eight components are functionally different, the&#13;
first three components are logically united in their operations and the Project seeks to develop them&#13;
as such. Thus, a comprehensive Budget and Public Expenditure Management System (BPEMS)&#13;
wvill be developed which will integrate in a single common system the information systems for&#13;
budget preparation, budget implementation, and accounting. The following sections provide a&#13;
description of the individual components of the Project.&#13;
Budget Preparation Sub-System&#13;
5.     Problem. The current process of budget preparation has several weaknesses, some of&#13;
which were identified by the 1993 PER. These weaknesses have generally led to a lack of&#13;
ownership of the budget by the sector ministries and has undermined the utility of the budget as an&#13;
instrument for achieving national priorities and for managing the financial resources of the&#13;
government.&#13;
6.     Some of the main weaknesses in budget preparation are: (a) preparation of the recurrent&#13;
budget on an incremental basis, i.e. by adding a certain percentage (based, for instance, on&#13;
inflation) to the previous year's estimates of expenditures, without reviewing whether the particular&#13;
activities are in line with government priorities or whether they are being implemented in the most&#13;
cost-effective manner; (b) absence of a medium-term outlook, or a lack of forward planning, of the&#13;
recurrent budget such that forward estimates of the recurrent costs of current policies and&#13;
programs are not developed, (c) lack of critical review of the government's own priorities in the&#13;
preparation of the development budget, and the absence of the estimation of its recurrent cost&#13;
implications and whether sufficient funds will be available to cover these recurrent costs; and (d)&#13;
lack of adequate budget guidance to the ministries, including the lack of hard expenditure ceilings&#13;
in the budget guidelines reflecting the Government's expenditure priorities.&#13;
7.     The above weaknesses in the budgeting process result in an inappropriate allocation of&#13;
resources. The need for restructuring of public expenditures is particularly acute now because (a) a&#13;
successful inflation management strategy is critically dependent on prudent public expenditure&#13;
management; (b) strategies for economic reform and poverty alleviation (being developed by the&#13;
Government will) require changes in the budget, both inter- and intra-sectorally; and (c) scope for&#13;
additional revenue generation is limited and the future of donor flows increasingly uncertain.&#13;
Hence, for an accelerated growth strategy, the efficiency of public expenditures is critical. 2&#13;
2   In the short-term, such efforts may be constrained by the large size of wage and wage-related&#13;
expenditures (the restructuring of which will need to await the outcome of the National Institutional&#13;
Renewal Program-NIRP) and the interest burden.&#13;

8.     Proposed Component Objectives and Activities. The basic objective of this component&#13;
is to improve the planning and budgeting of public expenditures and thus contribute to&#13;
strengthened fiscal policy formulation and implementation. For this component, the Project will&#13;
focus on the following sets of issues:&#13;
(a)      instituting a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) as part of the normal&#13;
budgetary process. This would involve (i) formulating program categories for&#13;
planning, budgeting and accounting; (ii) integrating of aid financed projects and&#13;
programs; (iii) preparing expenditure program profiles for each MDA showing the&#13;
object-wise outlays; (iv) ensuring that the forecasts are limited to current or existing&#13;
policies; (v) specifying the price basis; (vi) formulating a budget calendar, indicating&#13;
the preparation, review, and consolidation of these rolling forecasts; (vii) specifying the&#13;
linkages between the forecasts and the annual budget; and (viii) preparing a computer&#13;
software for the purpose. The coverage of the MTEF would be over both the recurrent&#13;
and the development budget. This would complement the BPEMS system and would be&#13;
fully integrated with it.&#13;
Several elements of an MTEF already exist in Ghana. For instance, an aggregative&#13;
three-year expenditure and revenue framework already exists under the Policy&#13;
Framework Paper (PFP) for 1995-97 (which will be updated in 1996). Medium-term&#13;
expenditure programming at the sectoral level either exists or is being developed in&#13;
three key sectors (Roads &amp; Highways, Health, and Basic Education) in the context of&#13;
their sector investment programs which are being supported by the Bank. In addition, a&#13;
rolling three-year Public Investment Program has been prepared by the Government for&#13;
some years.&#13;
(b)      improvements in the formulation of the annual budget. These improvements would&#13;
include (i) preparation of a model budget circular indicating the possible expenditure&#13;
ceilings within which MDA budgets have to be formulated; (ii) development of a&#13;
software for the Budget Division that will facilitate budget preparation; (iii) preparation&#13;
and installation of the budget software in the MDAs; (iv) arrangements for the eventual&#13;
electronic transmission of budget proposals from MDAs to the Budget Division of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance; and (v) program for consolidation and preparation of draft&#13;
budgets.&#13;
The budget software referred to above would enable the use of the historical, baseline,&#13;
and ceiling data for budgeting purposes, facilitate the iterative process of budget&#13;
submission, consolidation, revision, and finalization, provide for the tracking of the&#13;
budget process from initial proposal to Parliamentary approval and printing, produce a&#13;
master copy in a form suitable for presentation to Parliament and subsequent printing.&#13;
It will also permit the development of implications of rolling expenditure plans and&#13;
provide program profiles requiring special attention. This system will be an integral&#13;
part of the BPEMS referred to above.&#13;
(c)      the training of a core group of budget and finance staff from the Ministry of Finance,&#13;
the NDPC, and the MDAs in the preparation of an MTEF and the annual budget, and&#13;
in the use of the information systems in its preparation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Budget Implementation Sub-System&#13;
9.    Problem. The key problem identified in this area relates to deficient expenditure&#13;
monitoring and control systems. The lack of timely, accurate, and current information on budget&#13;
allocations, comnmitments and actual expenditures seriously undermines the Government's capacity&#13;
for fiscal management, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources and obscuring public&#13;
accountability. Even though the 1979 Financial Administration Decree (FAD) and the&#13;
corresponding Financial Administration Regulations (FAR) set out the basic principles of financial&#13;
reporting, monitoring, and control, these are often not adhered to. For instance, commitments are&#13;
irregularly recorded and reported by the ministries. In the absence of such records, expenditure&#13;
monitoring is resorted to on the basis of 'checks cleared' by the BoG or, as more recently, 'checks&#13;
issued' by the CAGD. Because of delays inherent in each step of payment processing, the Ministry&#13;
of Finance is able to monitor these expenditures only with considerable time lags undermining&#13;
expenditure monitoring and control, and necessitating the imposition of across-the-board cuts&#13;
towards the end of the year to maintain aggregate fiscal discipline. Undue delays in reporting make&#13;
it difficult to promptly close and prepare the financial accounts of the Government.&#13;
10.   Proposed Component Objectives and Activities. The basic objective of this component&#13;
is to ensure an orderly and smooth implementation of the budget, while providing adequate&#13;
flexibility to the MDAs to manage their programs and projects, as well as to enable the Ministry&#13;
of Finance to maintain oversight that is in conformity with the requirements of macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization. This will be developed through the following sets of activities under the Project.&#13;
(a)   the design and implementation of a Budget Classification System which is consistent with&#13;
the Chart of Accounts so as to permit the reporting of expenditures by the same codes as in&#13;
the budget.&#13;
(b)   the functional design of systems, processes, and procedures for expenditure controls. This&#13;
will involve all aspects of expenditure control prior to making payment authorizations,&#13;
such as checking for budget appropriations, prior commitments, verification for receipt of&#13;
goods and services, as well as the development of reporting formats, necessary laws and&#13;
regulations, and operating manuals.&#13;
(c)   the implementation of a computerized system (including software) to support the above&#13;
functional design. This system would be capable of providing timely, reliable, and up-to-&#13;
date information on budget allocations, commitments, and actual expenditures, and would&#13;
enable the production of periodic financial reports so as to permit monitoring and&#13;
management of the actual expenditures by individual spending ministries and by CAGD.&#13;
This system will be fully integrated with the Accounting Sub-System (see paras I 1-12&#13;
below) and the software for the Budget Division mentioned above.&#13;
(d)   the training of budget, finance, and treasury staff in the MDAs in budget implementation.&#13;
Accounting Sub-System&#13;
11.   Problem. The main problems identified in the accounting sub-system relate to (a) the lack&#13;
of a unified Chart of Accounts; (b) ignorance, non-compliance with, and obsolescence of elements&#13;
of the 1979 FAD and the 1979 FAR; and (c) the lack of an adequate cadre of trained, qualified&#13;
accounting staff in the line ministries as well as in the CAGD. These problems, in conjunction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
with those identified in budget implementation, were the prime reasons why the Consolidated&#13;
Accounts of the Central Government were not produced annually over 1983-92 even though the&#13;
annual submission of these is required by the FAD. It is only since 1993 that these accounts have&#13;
been prepared annually.&#13;
12.    Proposed Component Objectives and Activities. The objectives of the accounting sub-&#13;
system are to (i) promote a system of accounting that shows the effective utilization of the&#13;
financial resources of the country; (ii) provide a window to the public to ascertain the financial&#13;
status of the Government; and (iii) serve as a major instrument in the formulation and&#13;
implementation of Government policies. The project would seek to implant a modem accounting&#13;
sub-system which classifies, records and analyses in a timely, reliable, and standard manner all&#13;
government financial transactions. This sub-system would provide all basic financial transaction&#13;
data and reports to all other sub-systems and will form the core of the financial management&#13;
system being envisaged. Key activities would include:&#13;
(a)    formulation of a comprehensive Chart of Accounts covering receipts, expenditures, and&#13;
borrowing. The Chart of Accounts would be coded, reflect the function, MDA, program,&#13;
and items of expenditure, reflect the needs of each MDA, facilitate a link-up with the&#13;
development plan, and a link-up with the National Income Accounts.&#13;
(b)   introduction of a common General Ledger System;&#13;
(c)    reporting by Treasuries and consolidation of Treasury Reports by CAGD;&#13;
(d)    revised formulation of annual operating statements to be provided by the CAGD;&#13;
(e)    specification of Accounting Standards for Government. This would require the&#13;
introduction of new regulations for government-wide accounting;&#13;
(f)    eventual electronic link-up with the payroll and pension systems;&#13;
(g)   installation of an effective payments system including electronic payments where possible;&#13;
(h)   the training of government accounting staff in the new system.&#13;
Cash Management Sub-System&#13;
13.    Problem. Organized cash management does not exist in Ghana as is evidenced by the&#13;
following problems: (a) there is no cash flow plan that readily identifies and matches the flow of&#13;
revenues with those of disbursements, and provides forward estimates so as to form the basis for&#13;
planning the Government's borrowing requirements. As a result, the BoG open market sales of&#13;
treasury bills do not accurately reflect the liquidity position of the Government; (b) there is lack of&#13;
a system for prompt reporting of transactions and balances of the Consolidated Fund to which all&#13;
revenues are to be deposited and from which all disbursements are to be made; (c) there is a large&#13;
float of revenues constantly in the system reflecting the lags in the transfer to the BoG of, for&#13;
instance, revenues collected by the local offices of the revenue agencies and deposited with the&#13;
local commercial banks. While these are cash assets of the Government, they are not represented&#13;
as such as they are captured only when the revenues are transferred into the Consolidated Fund at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
the BoG; and (d) there is no integration between the preparation and execution of the budget, and&#13;
the determination of the cash requirements of the Government.&#13;
14.    Proposed Component Objectives and Activities. The objective of the cash management&#13;
component is to achieve an efficient provision of the cash resources of the Government while&#13;
voiding the immobilization of resources and minimizing the costs of borrowing. This will be&#13;
achieved through the introduction of a modem cash management system which will estimate,&#13;
project, monitor, and manage revenue inflows and expenditure outflows. Key activities under the&#13;
Project would include:&#13;
(a)    preparation and submission of cash needs by MDAs;&#13;
(b)    review by the Ministry of Finance of the above cash forecasts and linking them with&#13;
resource flow forecasts;&#13;
(c)    coordination of the releases made by the Ministry of Finance, MDAs, CAGD, and BoG;&#13;
(d)    determining public sector borrowing requirements on the basis of the cash flows;&#13;
(e)   the automation of the cash management system to permit real-time reconciliation between&#13;
the CAGD, the Bank of Ghana, and the Budget Division of the Ministry of Finance;&#13;
(f)   the development of a policy for the management of the cash assets including the rules&#13;
governing BoG treatment of the Consolidated Account and the financial arrangement&#13;
between the Government and the commercial banks on fees and interest payments.&#13;
Aid and Debt Management Sub-System&#13;
15.    Problem. The problems with respect to Ghana's debt management-both external and&#13;
domestic-are pnrmanrly two: (i) A single set of accounts on the country's external debt does not&#13;
exist. The ADMU of the Ministry of Finance is the unit charged, in principle, with the&#13;
responsibility of recording, monitoring, and projecting data on external debt, and authorizing&#13;
disbursements. Through Bank assistance under SAIS and EMS, the ADMU operationalized the&#13;
CS-DRMS. The data coverage of this system is still incomplete. In particular, information on&#13;
Government guarantees on external debt of parastatals and private agencies is not captured. As a&#13;
result, knowledge of the GoG's external current (and potential) indebtedness is incomplete. This is&#13;
a potentially problematic situation particularly vis-a-vis the timely payment of Ghana's external&#13;
debt obligations; and (ii) The recording and management of domestic debt remains a BoG&#13;
operation with no linkage with the ADMU. No database exists which captures government&#13;
liabilities.3&#13;
The same is true on the asset side of the Government's balance sheet (i.e. net lending by the&#13;
Government), too. This is, however, being addressed under a separate Bank project, the&#13;
Privatization and Public Enterprise Development Technical Assistance Project II, which is helping&#13;
the development of a database to capture information on Government assets-loans to parastatals&#13;
and private organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
16.   Proposed Project Goals and Activities. The objective of this component is to strengthen&#13;
the management of the acquisition, servicing, and retirement ofpublic debt. Key activities would&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   the integration of the external debt database between the ADMU, the BoG, and the CAGD&#13;
(including the establishment of an electronic link-up) so as to provide a single complete&#13;
status of Ghana's external debt. This is an activity in an advanced stage of completion.&#13;
(b)   the full operationalization of an Aid (external loans and grants) Management Information&#13;
System (AMIS), currently under development;&#13;
(c)   the integration of information on technical cooperation, currently incorporated in the&#13;
system of the National Technical Cooperation and Assistance Program (NaTCAP), with&#13;
AMIS;4&#13;
(d)   the strengthening of ADMU as the focal point for external debt data;&#13;
(e)   the training of staff from the ADMU in areas such debt portfolio analysis, negotiation&#13;
skills, international finance, budgeting, and information technology related to their&#13;
operational work.&#13;
Revenue Management Sub-System&#13;
17.   The objective of the reformns in revenue management is to promote systems of&#13;
administratiuon aimed at achieving greater taxpayer compliance and convenience, and to&#13;
increase the efficiency of revenue collection, reporting, andforecasting. The problems and&#13;
proposed reforms in each of the revenue sub-components is provided below:&#13;
Internal Revenue&#13;
18.   Problem. Significant strides have been made during the ERP in the collection of direct&#13;
taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Yet greater efficiency gains can be made and are&#13;
increasingly important given the paucity of additional new sources of revenues. The following&#13;
weaknesses have been identified in internal revenue: (a) the lack of a unique (and common to other&#13;
tax agencies) tax identification number which would permit greater inter-agency collaboration and&#13;
enable higher revenue collection. Currently, taxpayers are able to change districts freely and&#13;
thereby avoid paying taxes or to have several sources of income but only declare income from one&#13;
source; (b) the lack of adequate computer facilities which would allow for the timely integration of&#13;
data from IRS offices across the country, and its expeditious deposit onto the Consolidated&#13;
Account at the BoG; (c) weak capacity, particularly in the areas of tax audit, tax examination, and&#13;
records management.&#13;
19.   Proposed Component Objectives and Activities. The primary objective of the&#13;
investments in the IRS would be to improve taxpayer compliance and to increase the efficiency of&#13;
revenue forecasting, collection, and reporting by the IRS. To that end, the Project would support&#13;
the following activities:&#13;
4   The responsibility for NaTCAP has been transferred from the NaTCAP Secretariat to ADMU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
(a)   the development and introduction of a unique and common Taxpayer Identification&#13;
Number (TIN);&#13;
(b)   the development of a computer-based system for tax assessment, collection, reporting,&#13;
follow-up, and analysis;&#13;
(c)   the enhancement of tax audit, tax examination, records management capacities of the IRS;&#13;
(d)    installation of an electronic internal audit system; and&#13;
(e)   training in the areas of management, taxation, finance, accounting, budgeting, research,&#13;
policy, and forward estimation.&#13;
Customs, Excise, and Preventive Services&#13;
20.    Problem. Customs administration in Ghana suffers from three main problems: (a)&#13;
deficiencies in policies and procedures which hinder trade; (b) the lack of trained managers and&#13;
customs officials; and (c) outdated nature of computer equipment for customs purposes. These&#13;
problems have also been the subject of discussion under the Trade and Investment Gateway Project&#13;
being developed by the Bank which will address the first two problems in its project design. This&#13;
Project will support the third component which is more directly related to the flow of revenue&#13;
information in a timely and reliable manner. However, the development and implementation of&#13;
these computer-related needs would be contingent on the reforms in policies and procedures and&#13;
developed by the Bank as a joint package.&#13;
21.    Proposed Component Objectives and Activities. The primary objective of this project&#13;
component is to enhance taxpayer convenience and to maximize the efficiency of revenue&#13;
collection, reporting, andforecasting. To that end, the Project would support the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
(a)    an independent assessment of the customs data management system;&#13;
(b)   the development, and implementation, of a medium-term strategy for the modernization of&#13;
customs data management and related computer needs; and&#13;
(c)   the provision of training in customs data management and related areas. Other types of&#13;
training such as for management purposes would be provided under the Trade and&#13;
Investment Gateway Project.&#13;
Indirect Tax Reforms&#13;
22.    Problem. The Value Added Tax (VAT) was introduced in Ghana in March 1995 as a&#13;
replacement for the Sales Tax but had to be withdrawn within three months in the wake of protests&#13;
against what was claimed to be its high inflationary impact. The Sales Tax was re-introduced&#13;
along with a new Service Tax as a short-term measure while the indirect tax reforms were revisited&#13;
and revised.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
23.    Proposed Component Objectives and Activities. The objective of the new Indirect tax&#13;
will be to maximize the generation of indirect tax revenue in the country while enforcing greater&#13;
equity in taxation. This is to be achieved through a series of steps in the near- to medium-termn.&#13;
These relate to:&#13;
(a)    determining the organizational status of indirect tax administration. This would specify&#13;
the roles and responsibilities of the various tax agencies in indirect tax collection, their size&#13;
and structure, relationship with the other revenue agencies, and to questions of whether the&#13;
new indirect tax should be collected by a separate entity with nationwide operations, or&#13;
whether it should be amalgamated into one of the revenue agencies from which economies&#13;
of scale in tax collection and reporting can be derived,&#13;
(b)    reviewing the policy framework. This refers to companrsons with experiences in other&#13;
African countries which have successfully introduced the VAT, such as Zambia and&#13;
Uganda, review of the legal framework required, and a re-assessment of the publicity&#13;
campaign or the communications strategy needed (including the training of staff)&#13;
(c)    designing a new indirect tax. This relates to the design of the level and structure of the tax&#13;
rate, the nature and extent of exemptions, and the phasing-in of the implementation of the&#13;
tax.&#13;
(d)    evaluating the current software for indirect tax collection. Changes in the design of the&#13;
indirect tax, and the introduction of a TIN would require a re-evaluation of the software in&#13;
use for the registration of taxpayers, and the processing of retums and refunds, and a likely&#13;
purchase and customization of new software.&#13;
(e)    preparing for the launch of indirect tax reforms. This would include preparation of the&#13;
legislative bill that will need to be developed to introduce the new tax and the development&#13;
of the publicity program.&#13;
(f)    providing logistical support to the introduction of the new tax in terms of equipment and&#13;
supplies.&#13;
(g)    training of staff as well as taxpayers. The former need training in the technical aspects of&#13;
the tax and its collection, while the latter in areas of tax payment and record-keeping.&#13;
National Revenue Secretariat&#13;
24.    Problem. The National Revenue Secretariat (NRS) was set up under the SAIS project as&#13;
a central revenue coordinating and policymaking body. It was to be an autonomous body outside of&#13;
the Ministry of Finance, under a Cabinet Minister. It was charged with overseeing improvements in&#13;
tax collection, developing analytical capacity for tax policy analysis, formulating tax and revenue&#13;
policy, and preparing regular revenue estimates and projections. This was part of the "enclave"&#13;
approach to tax and customs administration in Ghana which Bank reviews have identified it as one&#13;
of the successful reform initiatives and which spearheaded the increase in tax revenues from a 6.5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
percent of GDP in 1984 to 16.2 percent of GDP by 1994.5 But since then, changes in management&#13;
leadership and the incorporation of the NRS into the Ministry of Finance as a revenue unit have&#13;
obscured its function and identity, and undermined its utility.&#13;
25.    Project Component Objectives and Activities. The objective of this component would&#13;
be to clarify the role of the NRS and its relationship with the other revenue agencies and the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The Project would support:&#13;
(a)    an independent assessment of the organizational status and role of the NRS, including its&#13;
relationship with the other revenue agencies, with a view to making recommendations for a&#13;
rational and efficient solution.&#13;
Audit Sub-System&#13;
26.    Problem. Audit requirements in Ghana are covered by the 1972 Audit Service Decree, the&#13;
1979 FAD, and, to a certain degree, by the 1992 Constitution. In October 1995, Coopers &amp;&#13;
Lybrand, Accra, began a diagnostic study of the Ghana Audit Service-financed under the Bank's&#13;
Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FINSAC)-which conducts external audits. Several problems&#13;
have been identified including weak technical skills and professional development, deficiencies in&#13;
the professional mix of staff, lack of use of computer technology, and inadequacy of logistics and&#13;
supplies. Internal audit also remains very weak. The FAD empowers the Auditor-General to make&#13;
arrangements for carrying out internal audits but concerns over potential conflict of interest&#13;
prompted the Auditor-General to assign the internal audit function to the Controller and&#13;
Accountant-General's Department in 1987. But this is also an unsatisfactory arrangements as the&#13;
accountants are now the internal auditors also.&#13;
27.    Proposed Component Objectives and Activities. The objective of this component is to&#13;
promote the timely and effective audit of transactions to ensure that resources are being usedfor&#13;
the specified purposes. Modern auditing seeks to attain the highest level of accountability and&#13;
transparency in the public sector through the implementation of the internal audit of accounts and&#13;
financial operations performed by qualified personnel reporting to the chief executive officer of the&#13;
institution, and a posterior external audit performed by a qualified supreme audit institution that is&#13;
legally, financially, and politically independent of the executive branch and reports to an elected&#13;
legislative body representing citizens in general. In pursuit of these ends, the Project would&#13;
support the following activities:&#13;
External Audit&#13;
(a)    development of national Audit Standards (including electronic delinquency);&#13;
(b)    specifications of Audit Reports;&#13;
(c)    introduction of some value for money audit;&#13;
See, for example, The World Bank, 1996, "The Enclave Approach to Tax and Customs&#13;
Administration in Ghana", mimeo, Africa Technical Department (Capacity Building Division) and&#13;
The World Bank, 1995, "Designing Technical Assistance Projects: Lessons from Ghana and&#13;
Uganda". OED Precis No. 95.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
(d)    on-line access to the budget implementation reports;&#13;
(e)   logistical support; and&#13;
(f)   training.&#13;
Internal Audit&#13;
(a)   institution of effective internal audit,&#13;
(b)    reporting on internal audit;&#13;
(c)   institutional arrangement for internal audit.&#13;
Procurement Sub-System&#13;
28.    Problem. To maximize expected gains in transparency and efficiency, the reforns of&#13;
public financial management would benefit from complementary reforms in the public sector's&#13;
procurement policies. The current procurement practices suffer from various deficiencies which&#13;
were recently diagnosed by a Bank report.6 Two key deficiencies are: (a) the multiplicity of&#13;
practices for the procurement of goods and services. The only formal rules and regulations are&#13;
incorporated in the Ghana Supplies Commission (GSC) Law which conducts no more than a&#13;
quarter of all public procurement in the country. Other procurement agencies use Bank and other&#13;
donors procurement guidelines. While this serves immediate needs of all concerned, it exposes the&#13;
country to potential problems when the country is required to depend on its own laws for&#13;
remedying procurement disputes and issues. In addition, even the current practice leaves bare the&#13;
area of local procurement and prevents the country from using National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) procedures in Bank-financed contracts; and (b) lack of timely processing and reporting to&#13;
the CAGD on public procurement, largely on account of manual processing of all purchases and&#13;
payments.&#13;
29.    Proposed Component Objectives and Activities. The objective of this component is to&#13;
streamline the procurement of goods, works, and services, and establish an effective monitoring&#13;
and tracking system. The Project would support the following:&#13;
(a)   the review of public procurement practices in Ghana with a view to formulating a national&#13;
procurement code and establishing mechanisms for monitoring compliance with the code.&#13;
Information Technology Strategy&#13;
30.    The Project would support the development of a strategic plan for the use of computer-&#13;
based financial management systems. This strategy would cover (i) the development of the&#13;
technology specifications to be used across Government-hardware, interface between various&#13;
systems, and communication networks to be used, and (ii) the development of a global strategy for&#13;
maintaining and upgrading the IT systems. The strategy will require that the technology used is&#13;
6   The World Bank, 1996, Ghana: Country Procurement Assessment Report, March.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
simple, breeds greatest familiarity with the potential users, and allows for interface between the&#13;
various components or sub-systems. In general, the following principles will be followed:&#13;
(a)    use application software packages already existent in the market, with the required&#13;
customization;&#13;
(b)    select application packages that run under UNIX and use a Relational Database&#13;
Management System (RDBMS); and&#13;
(c)    set up the hardware in a Local Area Network (LAN) shape, interconnecting the different&#13;
LAN servers in a distributed architecture.&#13;
31.    Application Software. For each project component, the GoG will try to identify the&#13;
application software package already existent in the market that most closely satisfies its data&#13;
processing needs. This package should be able to run on computers of different capacity in&#13;
accordance to the volume of transactions at each location. In addition, to avoid hardware&#13;
restrictions, the software will follow an "open system" concept to ensure portability to different&#13;
hardware platforms. In practice, the environment that comes closest to this concept is the UNIX&#13;
operating system; consequently, the software package will run under UNIX. In order to facilitate&#13;
the use of the package by the GoG, it would be desirable that the application would use an&#13;
RDBMS and that it was developed using a Fourth Generation Language (4GL). Furthernore, use&#13;
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) will offer a user-friendly enviromnent for data entry and&#13;
access.&#13;
32.   In summary, the GoG will try to identify UNIX-based software packages, for instance for&#13;
government accounting, developed using a 4GL and a RDBMS, interacting with the end-user&#13;
through a GUI, which with appropriate customization will be used at the different units.&#13;
33.    Hardware. With respect to the hardware, each unit will need several workstations for&#13;
various tasks such as to enter the accounting transactions, undertake queries or print reports.&#13;
Since the information will have to be consolidated and shared, at each location a server will be&#13;
interconnected with the workstations forning a LAN. Each unit's budget and its expenditures&#13;
infornation will be stored in the server and, with adequate security restrictions, the workstations&#13;
will be able to retrieve and update the data in the server. If adequate communications facilities are&#13;
available, individual unit servers will be connected to the servers in the regional offices which, in&#13;
tum, will be interconnected to the main server in Accra. This will constitute a "distributed&#13;
architecture" network in which each unit, regional office and central server are "nodes." Each node&#13;
will have its own data processing and database management capability and summary or detailed&#13;
data, as required, will be sent to the main server. Where such connections will not be feasible,&#13;
diskettes containing the data will be sent periodically. Since each node will have the computing&#13;
power most appropriate to its requirements, resource utilization will be optimized and eventual&#13;
malfunction of one node will not affect the others. In addition, end-users at each unit will have&#13;
responsibility over their LAN and, as a result, a sense of ownership.&#13;
Human Resource Development&#13;
34.    The project design strongly emphasizes human resource development in order to provide&#13;
staff with opportunitiesfor the transfer and acquisition of new skills and to contribute to a core&#13;
of trainedfinancial managers in Government. Given weak local capacity, the provision of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
adequate training is critical to the sustainability of the Project and to the reform program. The&#13;
training under the Project can be divided into six types, depending on the audience and the nature&#13;
of the training:&#13;
(a)    specific training to key Government staff in the principles, concepts, and methodologies for&#13;
the subject areas covered by the project components; this is training related to the&#13;
operational work of the staff,&#13;
(b)    general training to the people in the financial management chain related to aspects of&#13;
financial management such as accounting, budgeting, policymaking, taxation, etc. which&#13;
are relevant to;&#13;
(c)    general training to staff in standard computer software packages;&#13;
(d)    training to senior-level management and policymakers in the use of computer-based&#13;
financial management information systems;&#13;
(e)    end-user training in the use of the computer-based financial management information&#13;
systems; and&#13;
(f)    technical training to GoG system analysts and programmers in the use of the specific tools&#13;
to be employed for developing and implementing the information systems under the&#13;
Project, such as RDBMS, or UNIX operating system.&#13;
35.    The Project will provide for such training in the context of an overall training strategy&#13;
primarily using domestic resources and facilities. Training will be based on separate training needs&#13;
assessments for each agency. These would identify the current capabilities, the areas for training,&#13;
and the mechanisms for providing it. This will also take into account the existing training facilities&#13;
in these agencies and in the public sector generally. Most system-related training would be&#13;
provided by the system vendors as part of their system implementation. External training would&#13;
be limited to only those skills relevant to the success of the Project which cannot be obtained&#13;
locally. External providers of training will be used to train local trainers. The Project would permit&#13;
a limited number of structured Study Tours for key staff involved in the implementation of the&#13;
Project to learn from what other countries have done in modernizing their financial management&#13;
systems.&#13;
Legal Framework Revision&#13;
36.    The Project would support the revision of the legal framework for financial administration&#13;
in Ghana with a view to providing an adequate legalframeworkforfinancial management which&#13;
ensures transparency and accountability. This would require (i) a review of the current legislative&#13;
framework in the light of the changed political and institutional arrangements and practices; and&#13;
(ii) the development of revised financial rules and regulations to be submitted to Parliament for&#13;
approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Development of Manuals&#13;
37.    Manuals will be developed to provide operation guides for the convenience of the public&#13;
servants. These would include the preparation of Budget and Accounting Manuals as well as the&#13;
preparation of operational manuals on the hardware and softvare that may be installed under the&#13;
various project components.&#13;
Communications Strategy&#13;
38.    The Project recognizes the need for an effective communications strategy for the Project in&#13;
order to promote an understanding of the content and usefilness of the financial management&#13;
reforms being introduced. This will be addressed through two initiatives: (i) Inception&#13;
Workshops, and (ii) publication of a newsletter.&#13;
39.    Inception Workshops. A series of Inception Workshops has been launched to (a)&#13;
reinforce the concept ofjoint ownership and responsibility forfinancial management in&#13;
government, and (b) ensure the fuillest acceptance, participation, and cooperation of all key&#13;
players in public financial management. To these ends, the workshops will address the what, why&#13;
and how of the reform program, and elicit the thoughts and ideas of the participants which will then&#13;
feed into the design of the reforms. In particular, the workshops will educate the participants on&#13;
the objectives and scope of the reform program, outline what the benefits are likely to be and how&#13;
the participants would gain from them directly, explain how the public financial management&#13;
reform program would fit into ongoing institutional reform initiatives, discuss what the roles and&#13;
functions of the key players in financial management should be, and discuss how the sustainability&#13;
and success of the reforms can be ensured.&#13;
40.    These workshops would be targeted at (a) ministers, key presidential staffers, and chief&#13;
directors; (b) accounting, treasury, and budget officers; (c) managers in various line ministries, and&#13;
(d) private sector agents such as the private contractors, the Chamber of Commerce, the Private&#13;
Sector Roundtable, joumalists, academics, and local think-tanks; and (e) other target groups in&#13;
civil society.&#13;
41.    These workshops were started with the launch of PUFMARP by the Minister of Finance at&#13;
a tvo-day Workshop for senior civil servants in July, 1995. Subsequently, the Controller and&#13;
Accountant-General discussed the program with his staff from across the country at his annual&#13;
staff conference in September, 1995. Later, in July 1996, a workshop was organized with the&#13;
sector ministries in Accra on Budget and Public Expenditure Management. More Inception&#13;
Workshops are planned at the central, and regional levels. These workshops will be funded under&#13;
the Project. Additional funds through the Client Consultation Funds provided by the World Bank&#13;
are also being used to finance these workshops.&#13;
42.    PUFMARP Newsletter. A newsletter will be produced by the Project Management and&#13;
distributed widely within Government, to the donors, and the private sector to (i) disseminate&#13;
information on the status of the reforms, (ii) announce implementation schedules, and (iii) provide&#13;
examples of the latest and state-of-the-art practices in financial management from Ghana, Africa,&#13;
and the World. This newsletter will be produced quarterly initially with the frequency increased to&#13;
every two months as project implementation gathers speed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Project Management&#13;
43.    The Project would provide for the support of a PUFMARP Implementation Team in the&#13;
Ministry of Finance to assist the Government in the implementation of the overall reform program&#13;
as well as those elements supported by this Project (see implementation arrangements below).&#13;
Assistance under the Project would cover salaries and other compensation for three contractual&#13;
members of the Team-the PUFMARP Manager, the Finance Manager, and the Information&#13;
Technology Manager-and for training, equipment, supplies, and civil works, as estimated.&#13;
C.    Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
44.    Tracking project performance indicators is necessary to monitor and evaluate not only the&#13;
implementation of the Project but also its end-results or outcomes. A set of such indicators has&#13;
been identified. These are presented in Annex A. Due to the functionally distinct components of&#13;
the project, the performance indicators have been developed for each component. The input and&#13;
process indicators summarize the set of activities that will be supported by the Project. The output&#13;
and outcome indicators identify for each component what the deliverables and expected end-results&#13;
are. Target dates are specified for each of the output indicators; however, the outcome indicators&#13;
can only be assessed over a period after the end of the Project; hence, a timetable for them is not&#13;
provided. This set of indicators will serve as the basis for project monitoring, supervision and&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
II.    PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Project Implementation&#13;
45.   Project implementation arrangements are described below. The Project is expected to be&#13;
fully implemented over a five year period with most activities completed over four years.&#13;
However, the process of financial management reform is a continuing process and it is envisaged&#13;
that the Government would continue to initiate and implement reforms in financial management as&#13;
and when needed. This is essential to ensure that the benefits from the project are maximized over&#13;
the long term.&#13;
46.    The Steering Committee. The Government set up a Steering Committee in June 1995 to&#13;
oversee the design and implementation of PUFMARP. The Steering Commnittee has 14 members:&#13;
(i) the Deputy Minister of Finance (Chairman); (ii) the Chief Director, MoF; (iii) the Director of&#13;
Budget; (iv) the Controller and Accountant-General, (v) the Deputy Controller and Accountant-&#13;
General (Financial Management Services); (vi) senior representative from the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government; (vii) senior representative from the Ministry of Roads and Highways; (viii) senior&#13;
representative from the Ministry of Health; (ix) senior representative from the Ministry of&#13;
Education; (x) senior representative from the Office of the Head of the Civil Service; (xi) senior&#13;
representative from the National Institutional Renewal Program; (xii) a Deputy Governor of the&#13;
Bank of Ghana; (xiii) the Deputy Auditor-General (Finance); and (xiv) the PUFMARP Manager.&#13;
47.   The Steering Committee has been charged with the following functions and&#13;
responsibilities: to establish and monitor a timetable for the implementation of PUFMARP; to&#13;
review and approve the procurement of goods and services for PUFMARP; to coordinate and&#13;
approve the various project components so as to ensure coherence and compatibility in design,&#13;
management, and implementation, to develop the consensus on, and continuing commitment to,&#13;
PUFMARP; and to make recommendations on policy issues which may arise in the design and&#13;
implementation of the program. The Committee is already mobilized and has held various&#13;
meetings with respect to the selection of the members for the PUFMARP Implementation Team&#13;
and the initial selection of consultants for the budget and public expenditure management&#13;
component of the reform program. Local donor representatives are also invited to these meetings.&#13;
48.    PUFMARP Implementation Team. The PUFMARP Implementation Team will be&#13;
comprised of three groups of people: The first group comprises three persons with special skills&#13;
required for the Project who have been hired on contractual terms. They are the PUFMARP&#13;
Manager, the Finance Manager, and the Information Technology Manager and form the core&#13;
Project Management Team. The terms of reference for all of these have been clearly laid out.&#13;
These three key persons are Ghanaians and were hired on contractual terms in May/June 1996&#13;
following an international job posting and competitive selection process. A key responsibility for&#13;
these people would be to train counterpart staff over a period of time. Monitorable indicators will&#13;
be used to assess their performance. The Government will provide adequate support staff and&#13;
facilities for them to perform their tasks effectively.&#13;
49.   The second group will consist of GoG staff who will be working on the project on a full-&#13;
time basis. This group will consist of a Deputy Controller and Accountant-General and a Project&#13;
Desk Officer from the Ministry of Finance. The Project Desk Officer will be responsible for (a)&#13;
administering disbursements, (b) providing advice on procurement, (c) maintaining project records&#13;
and preparing accounts (see Section G below), and (d) coordinating with the World Bank Desk in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. The Project Desk Officer will also assist the PUFMARP Manager in&#13;
promoting communication between the various implementing agencies, preparing project progress&#13;
reports, and reporting to the Chief Director, Ministry of Finance. The Project Desk Officer would&#13;
be assisted in this task by an accountant to be financed from the credit.&#13;
50.    The GoG staff will be complemented by counterparts from each of the various departments&#13;
or agencies that will be implementing components of the Project. This would be a flexible&#13;
arrangement and staff would be assigned on a part-time or full-time basis, as required, for specified&#13;
periods of time. IDA funds will not be used for salary supplements for these staff&#13;
51.    The third group would comprise of consultants who will be designing and implementing&#13;
the various components. The working principle being adopted is one of teamwork. As soon as the&#13;
PUFMARP Implementation Team is fully mobilized, a team-building workshop will be organized&#13;
for the members to foster the right spirit.&#13;
52.    The Implementation Team will report directly to the PUFMARP Steering Committee&#13;
through the Chief Director, MoF. It will also liaise closely with the Controller and Accountant-&#13;
General, the Director of Budget, and the heads of the various agencies where reforms will be&#13;
introduced.&#13;
B.    Bank Role in Project Implementation&#13;
53.   In view of the significant complexity of technical assistance projects of this nature,&#13;
frequent supervision missions will need to be undertaken using both Bank and consultant staff.&#13;
T'he resources that need to be allocated for this will be high compared to the average technical&#13;
assistance projects. It is estimated that these requirements would be in the range of 30 staff weeks&#13;
per year. Where possible, these supervision missions will be coincided with those from other&#13;
donors financing the Project. It is envisaged that quarterly supervision missions will be required of&#13;
two weeks each. The two sets of core skills that will be required for supervision would be in&#13;
information technology and public financial management although specific missions may require&#13;
component-specific skills in these two areas.&#13;
54.    Given the complexity of the Project, thorough annual reviews of the Project would be done&#13;
to (a) assess performance against the performance benchmarks, (b) review the appropriateness of&#13;
continuing with the project design, and (c) take corrective actions. These reviews would be done&#13;
jointly by the Government and IDA, no later than the end of each calendar year starting in 1997. A&#13;
mid-term review of the Project will also take place in the third year in lieu of the annual review.&#13;
This review would be done jointly with the donors cofinancing the project. This would be done no&#13;
later than the end of 1999. This review will include additionally an assessment of (a) the&#13;
Government's continuing commitment to the financial management reform program and&#13;
achievement of the project targets laid out in Annex A, (b) overall progress in integrating the&#13;
various program components into a cohesive and complementary set of actions, (c) institutional&#13;
capacity to carry on project activities, amd (d) a review of arrangements for meeting recurrent&#13;
costs.&#13;
C.    Implementation Schedules&#13;
55.   The Implementation Schedule of the Project is presented in Schedule B of the Technical&#13;
Annex. While the Government is in full agreement with the details of the project components,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
implementation arrangements and schedule, and the set of performance indicators as laid out in the&#13;
Technical Annex, it is devcloping a morc detailed Implementation Plan which will be a condition&#13;
for credit effectiveness. This Plan will also detail the performance indicators for the contractual&#13;
staff on the PUFMARP Implementation Team.&#13;
D.      Project Financing and Costs&#13;
56.    Project Financing. T'he proposed IDA credit of US$20.9 million would finance 68&#13;
percent of total project costs. Total project costs comprise 64 percent in foreign exchange costs&#13;
and 36 percent in local costs. Other donors- the ODA and EU-will finance about US$6.9&#13;
million in grants and the balance will be financed by the Govemment out of its own resources.&#13;
Firm  commitments for donor cofinancing is not yet available but each of thesc donor agencies is&#13;
preparing its ow,nl technical assistance project to support the various componcnts of the Project.&#13;
ODA is expected to finance the budget preparation component, the indirect tax refomi component,&#13;
and sonic training and workshops. EU is expected to finance the audit component as well as some&#13;
trainiing and workshops. The recurrent costs, which essentially comprise operations and&#13;
maintenancc expenditures for cquipmenlt, will be wholly financed by the Governrnent.&#13;
57.    Project Costs. Table I shows total project costs, by project component and expenditure&#13;
category'. 'The bulk of the investments are being made in BPEMS-covcring the budgeting, budget&#13;
execution and fiscal reporting, and accounting sub-systems-which is likelv to account for nearly&#13;
half of the total project costs.&#13;

Budget and Public Expenditure Management System&#13;
for the&#13;
Government of Ghana&#13;
Issued October 1995&#13;
I.    Introduction&#13;
1.    The Government of Ghana's Public Expenditure Review for 1993 highlighted several&#13;
problems including weak budget preparation, weak expenditure monitoring and control&#13;
mechanisms and the lack of a proper accounting system. Subsequently, the GoG with inputs from&#13;
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the Overseas Development&#13;
Administration (ODA), and the World Bank developed a medium-term strategy for reforming the&#13;
public financial management system. This strategy seeks to develop an integrated public.financial&#13;
management system. This strategy has since been adopted by the Cabinet and forms the basis for&#13;
planned measures to be supported by technical assistance from ODA, CIDA, and the World Bank.&#13;
2.     Some elements of an integrated public financial management system already exist in&#13;
Ghana or are being implemented -- for instance, the customs system, a debt management system,&#13;
and an Integrated Personnel and Payroll Database (IPPD). Since 1994, there have also been&#13;
significant positive developments in governmental accounting and financial reporting. But there&#13;
remains a strong need to strengthen and consolidate these developments. The GoG has prioritized&#13;
key areas for immediate action -- budgeting, public accounting, and financial reporting. The GoG&#13;
consequently wishes to proceed to set up a modem Budget and Public Expenditure Management&#13;
System (BPEMS). These terms of reference provide a description of the technical assistance&#13;
required by GoG to develop and implement the BPEMS component of its overall public financial&#13;
management reform program as provided in Table 1. This BPEMS will be implemented in&#13;
Ministries, Departments, and Agencies in Accra and all other regional capitals.&#13;
3.     The GoG therefore invites qualified firms, with experience in the design and&#13;
implementation of computer-based government financial management systems to assist in this&#13;
project. Extensive experience in the design and implementation of similar systems for other&#13;
government agencies. Previous experience in the implementation of similar systems in less&#13;
developed countries or in countries of the British Commonwealth will be an advantage. Part of the&#13;
services required under this project could be satisfactorily carried out by local firms. International&#13;
firms are required to enter into partnerships with at least one local firm in both the design and the&#13;
implementation of BPEMS.&#13;
4.     The consultants will need to work closely with GoG officials in the various financial&#13;
organs of the Government which have responsibility for fiscal management processes, including,&#13;
inter-alia, the offices of the Controller and Accountant General (CAG), the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MoF), the Bank of Ghana (BoG), and the various Ministries, Departments, and Agencies&#13;

(MDAs), etc. The consultants will report to the Project Manager who will head a Project Team&#13;
which is to be set up by the GoG. The Project Team will work under the auspices of a Steering&#13;
Committee which is headed by the Deputy Minister of Finance and includes the Controller and&#13;
Accountant General, the Chief Director of the Ministry of Finance, and representatives from some&#13;
key line ministries. The Project Team will include well qualified professionals in financial&#13;
management and information technology for whom an international search is underway.&#13;
II.    Objectives&#13;
5.    The fundamental objective of BPEMS is to implement a reliable, scientifically developed,&#13;
computerized, broad-based budget and public expenditure management system that is capable of&#13;
providing accurate, timely, and up-to-date information on commitments, actual expenditures,&#13;
budget allocations and financial reports in order to:&#13;
(a)    enable MoF to institute a scientific, pragmatic, and meaningful budgetary system&#13;
for the country;&#13;
(b)    enable the MDAs and Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies&#13;
(MMDAs) to better manage their budgets and ensure that sectoral budget&#13;
allocations are not exceeded;&#13;
(c)    enable the MoF to ensure effective implementation and adherence to the national&#13;
budget;&#13;
(d)    provide a basis for improved financial management in Government;&#13;
(f)    enable the CAG to fulfill his statutory functions of reporting on the national public&#13;
accounts;&#13;
(g)    enable prompt and accurate reconciliation of the national public accounts with the&#13;
accounts of the Bank of Ghana, MDAs, and MMDAs; and&#13;
(h)    enhance public accountability.&#13;
6.    BPEMS will be designed to meet the needs of users of financial information. Such a&#13;
system would need to be comprehensive in terms of coverage and be a source of reliable and timely&#13;
data to become a credible source of information for users. It will provide an integrated&#13;
government-wide budgeting and accounting system, will encompass the functional requirements for&#13;
the budget preparation, budget execution, budget evaluation, and accounting processes and would&#13;
cover the appropriation, commitment, funds allocation, and payment processes for both the&#13;
recurrent and the development budget of both centralized and decentralized governmental agencies&#13;
and institutions. The system should also facilitate the proposed devolution of financial&#13;
responsibility to MDAs, and MMDAs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
III.   Scope of Work&#13;
7.    The Scope of Work for this consultancy involves the tasks associated with the design and&#13;
implementation of the above systems including the specification of the hardware and software&#13;
requirements and the provision of training.&#13;
8.    BPEMS will be implemented in a phased manner. In Phase I, BPEMs will be&#13;
designed, specifications developed for the required hardware and softvare, and procurement&#13;
arrangements will be completed. It is anticipated that this can be completed by March 31, 1996.&#13;
In Phase II, BPEMS will be implemented in at least seven priority ministries by June 30, 1996.&#13;
The seven priority ministries are: Ministry of Finance (including the Controller and Accountant&#13;
General's Department), Ministry of Roads and Highways, Ministry of Works and Housing,&#13;
Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Information, and Ministry of Local&#13;
Government and rural Development. (The exact coverage of departments and agencies under the&#13;
ministries will be determined later.). In Phase III, PBEMS will be replicated across remaining&#13;
ministries in Accra and the regional capitals. This will be completed by December 31, 1997.&#13;
9.     Each phase will normally start upon substantial completion of the preceding phase and will&#13;
be contingent upon the satisfactory completion and acceptance by GoG and the World Bank of the&#13;
deliverables listed for that phase. The aim of the prioritization of the implementation is to ensure&#13;
that the consultant executes the contract in accordance with the TORs and at the same time to&#13;
enable a phased handing over of the products to the Govermment. The consultant will be required&#13;
to present monthly Project Status Report to the Project Manager. The report will specify activities&#13;
conducted by the consultant during the preceding month; problems encountered, if any, and&#13;
proposed solutions; and activities expected to be performed during the following month.&#13;
10.   The tasks and major deliverables associated with each phase of the project are listed&#13;
below:&#13;
IV.   Phase I: Systems Design and Specification of Hardware and Software Requirements&#13;
A.    Preparation of the detailed functional design and requirements for the specified&#13;
systems and development of specifications for the Technology Architecture required for the&#13;
implementation of these systems.&#13;
11.   The tasks involved in this activity would include:&#13;
(a)    Studying the functional processes including administrative procedures, transaction&#13;
documents, forms and information flows, data flow statistics, related to the&#13;
accounting and reporting, payroll, pension, and cash management areas currently&#13;
in use.&#13;
(b)    Developing and defining a new set of functional processes, information flows,&#13;
procedures, transaction types and associated documents and forms, and related&#13;
structures required to set up the new system.&#13;
(c)    Developing a full functional design for the computer systems required, including&#13;
the specification of the major data bases and data entities, the outputs reports, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
input formats, transaction documents, input screen designs, processing and&#13;
controls for the systems required at various nodes of the information flow network,&#13;
the interfaces and data flows between these nodes and with external systems.&#13;
(d)    Design of the Technology Architecture to implement the Information Systems.&#13;
This would include drawing up specifications of the -1W and S/W to be installed&#13;
at various nodes and the mode of interconnection of this Hardware and Software.&#13;
The overall H1W, S/W strategy to be employed for implementation is determined&#13;
by the fact that a Government-wide accounting system will require a multi-tiered&#13;
network with modules at the central and regional office levels. The system would&#13;
require facilities for generating, storing, and processing data at each level and for&#13;
exchanging data between levels. The data volumes encountered could vary widely&#13;
across the nodes of the network, dictating the size of the computer at each node.&#13;
Application software should therefore be scaleable for small or large computers&#13;
and usable on a variety of H/W platforms. The system should utilize a distributed&#13;
computer architecture with computing power located at the various nodes of the&#13;
network. The software environment should be portable to different platforms&#13;
(UNIX-based) and use modern application development tools such as Relational&#13;
Data Base Management Systems (RDBMS), Fourth Generation Languages&#13;
(4GLS), and Graphical User Interfaces (GUls). The consultants should ensure&#13;
that these aspects are kept in mind while developing the technology architecture.&#13;
In view of the availability of local expertise on ORACLE, SYBASE, INFORMIX,&#13;
WINDOWS, the consultant shall give preference to systems utilizing these tools.&#13;
12.   This task would include:&#13;
*   Surveying GoG offices and budget at the central, regional, and district levels, to&#13;
determine the locations where the computer systems would need to be implemented,&#13;
the associated transaction volumes (current and projected) and data requirements, to&#13;
determine sizes and configurations of the HIW, S/W to be installed at these nodes&#13;
and the mode of the interconnection of the nodes between the center and the regions,&#13;
to ensure accurate and timely data transfers between the nodes.&#13;
*   Preparing the specifications of the hardware, systems software, application&#13;
development software, and the application software package required at the various&#13;
sites for each phase of the project for incorporation in the tender documents.&#13;
*   Drawing up specifications for associated facilities required for the installation of the&#13;
system, such as power stabilizers, UPSs, telecommunication interfaces, and&#13;
computer site specifications for incorporation into the tender documents.&#13;
13.   The primary deliverables for Phase I will be:&#13;
Budget and Expenditure Mananement System&#13;
* A Revised Budgetary Classification.&#13;
* Functional Design document for the Information Systems.&#13;
* Specifications for the hardware and software and related facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
Accounting and Reporting System&#13;
* A new Chart of Accounts consistent with the Budgetary Classification.&#13;
* Functional Design document for the Information Systems.&#13;
* Complete set of transaction documents, reporting formats, procedures, manuals (for&#13;
both budgets and accounting) required for the implementation of the systems.&#13;
* Application Systems design.&#13;
* Technology Architecture including specifications for H/W, S/W, and&#13;
Communications Systems and associated facilities.&#13;
In addition, the organizational changes required to implement these systems should also be&#13;
detailed. Such GoG divisions or units that need to be created or eliminated and changes in staffing&#13;
requirements.&#13;
B.    Search for Application Software&#13;
14.    On the basis of the functional analysis above, the consultants will investigate altematives&#13;
for application softvare. This would include investigating and ascertaining which off- the-shelf&#13;
software packages can meet the functional requirements as defined above. While conducting a&#13;
search for software packages, the consultants will ensure that: (i) the software packages provide&#13;
the required functionality; (ii) local support is available for the package and it is possible to&#13;
obtain and install upgrades and/or changes to the packages in Ghana as they become available;&#13;
(iii) the vendor for the package provides customization assistance as may be required or&#13;
alternatively the package source code is available for making changes as may be required; (iv) the&#13;
costs associated with any customization are identified clearly in the total cost; (v) the package runs&#13;
on a range of hardware and operating software which is compliant with the hardware/software&#13;
strategy proposed for the systems (above); (vi) adequate documentation is available to enable&#13;
package installation and use; and (vii) licensing arrangements clearly specify use of the package&#13;
at multiple sites in Ghana.&#13;
15.    The deliverables for this activity will be:&#13;
The results of the application software package evaluation process with the selection of&#13;
the application software which best meets the requirements of the proposed systems.&#13;
C.    Preparation of Tender Documents for the Acquisition of Hardware and Software&#13;
16.    During this activity, the consultants will assist the Government in the procurement of the&#13;
H/W and S/W. The consultants will:&#13;
(a)    Incorporate the Hardware and Software Specifications prepared as part of the&#13;
earlier task to prepare a request for proposals for procurement of the Hardware&#13;
and Software. These tender documents should be prepared in accordance with the&#13;
World Bank Procurement Guidelines and Procedures. It may be noted that the&#13;
H/W, S/W will be procured via an integrated procurement package but will be&#13;
delivered in several stages. Delivery will be, first, for the Pilot system and then,&#13;
over a period of time, for the replication of the system at other sites. These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
specifications must include allowance for maintenance and support for the&#13;
hardware and software for a period of 5 years, and for consumables for 5 years.&#13;
H/W  requirements should also address environmental requirements such as&#13;
Uninterrupted Power Supply Units (UPSs), etc.&#13;
(b)    Develop criteria for the evaluation of vendor proposals.&#13;
(c)    Assist the Government in the tendering process and in evaluating vendor&#13;
proposals and in the acquisition of the hardware and software.&#13;
(d)    Provide technical management and quality assurance of the vendor's work, plan&#13;
and prepare for data conversion and systems acceptance testing.&#13;
17.    The deliverables for this activity will be:&#13;
* Specifications and bid documents for the procurement of Hardware and Software for&#13;
the implementation&#13;
* Evaluation Criteria for Hardware and Software and a test data required to ensure the&#13;
proper functioning of the application software;&#13;
* Assistance to the Government in the tendering process, in evaluating vendor proposals&#13;
and in the acquisition of hardware and software.&#13;
* Technical management and quality assurance of the vendor's work;&#13;
* Data Conversion Plan; and&#13;
* User Acceptance Test Plan.&#13;
D.    Preparation of a Detailed Implementation and Training Plan&#13;
18.    The consultants will develop a detailed implementation plan and schedule listing all&#13;
associated tasks and their logical dependencies. this schedule will show all tasks associated with&#13;
the procurement and installation of the hardware and software, software customization, training of&#13;
local personnel, and installation of the system at prescribed sites.&#13;
19.    This also requires the consultants to assess the capacity of government officials to use and&#13;
manage the recommended system and accordingly develop a detailed training plan for staff. This&#13;
plan will ensure adequate capacity building in the ministries and suggest institutional arrangements&#13;
for systems support and maintenance.&#13;
20.    The key deliverable for this will be:&#13;
* Implementation plan including schedule and responsibilities.&#13;
* Assessment of staff capacity.&#13;
* User Training Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
V.     Phase 11: Pilot Systems Implementation in Seven Ministries in Accra&#13;
and the Regional Capitals&#13;
21.    Pilot Systems implementation will involve: (i) the installation and tests of hardware and&#13;
basic software (such as DBMS, Application Development tools etc.), (ii) installation and testing of&#13;
the application software, and (iii) training operating system end-users.&#13;
22.    The consultants will assist the GoG in managing the installation of the hardware, the basic&#13;
software, and application software. Each of these tasks are discussed in detail below:&#13;
(a)    Installation of Hardware. The consultants will assist GoG in supervising the&#13;
supplier in the installation and testing of the hardware procured. This would&#13;
include supervision of site preparations for the hardware including electrical&#13;
power requirements, voltage stabilizers, telecommunications, and other elements&#13;
as required. The consultant will also perform all required hardware acceptance&#13;
tests on behalf of the GoG.&#13;
(b)    Installation of Software. The consultants will assist the GoG with the&#13;
implementation, testing of the application software and its customized version.&#13;
This includes setting up any initial data tables, files, databases, etc. as required by&#13;
the application.. The consultants would be required to assist the Government in&#13;
quality assurance tests to ensure that the application packages have the required&#13;
functionality. In case a package requires customization to meet specified&#13;
functional requirements, the consultant will specify the changes required and&#13;
arrange for the changes to be implemented.&#13;
(c)    The consultants will insure the availability of the documentation needed for the&#13;
operation and maintenance of the application software as well as for end-user&#13;
training.&#13;
23.    Deliverables for this Phase include:&#13;
* Assistance to the Government in the installation and testing of the hardware and&#13;
software.&#13;
* Ensuring that the H/W and S/W supplied by the selected vendors meets the design&#13;
specifications.&#13;
* Ensuring that tested systems modules, including the modules that will be implemented&#13;
at the central, regional, and district offices are fully functional.&#13;
* User manuals and other technical documentation to enable the full operation and&#13;
maintenance of the systems.&#13;
* Training manuals for end-users.&#13;
* Training of sufficient local staff to a level which will enable them to operate and&#13;
maintain the systems and to provide necessary end-user support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
The latter three items are usually provided by the system vendors but the consultant will still be&#13;
responsible for ensuring quality and volume. In case the vendors fall short, the consultant will be&#13;
responsible for providing them.&#13;
VI.   Phase III: Replication of the System Across Remaining Ministries in Accra&#13;
and the Regional Capitals&#13;
24.    This phase will cover the replication of the systems to other ministries. Deliverables for&#13;
this phase would include:&#13;
* A replication plan and schedule for the system for all designated sites.&#13;
* A document (check list) detailing tasks that need to be undertaken for replication of the&#13;
system at a typical regional or district site.&#13;
* Working closely with the H/W, S/W vendor to ensure that the first five replications are&#13;
operational.&#13;
* Training of sufficient local staff capable of carrying out subsequent replications.&#13;
VII.  Level of Effort Estimates&#13;
25.   It is estimated that the project will require a total of about 75 man-months of effort to be&#13;
provided by the selected firm of consultants.&#13;
VIII. Background Information on Current Public Expenditure Management&#13;
26.   Laws and Regulations. The statutes and regulations relating to the financial&#13;
administration of public resources are found primarily in the following four documents:&#13;
*   The 1992 Constitution&#13;
*   The Financial Administration Decree, 1979&#13;
*   The Financial Administration Regulations, 1979&#13;
*   Departmental Accounting Instruction and Enabling Legislation of specific MDAs and&#13;
MMDAs.&#13;
27.    Budgetary Process. The Government of Ghana plans and executes its Budget in three&#13;
stages:&#13;
Stare 1: Planning and Preparation&#13;
*   MoF issues annual budget circular NOT later than six months before the end of each&#13;
financial year (FAR 30).&#13;
*   Budgets for MDAs are prepared by MDAs and submitted to the Ministry of Finance&#13;
by September 30.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Stage 2: Analysis andApproval&#13;
*   The Ministry of Finance holds Budget Hearings in order to coordinate the requests for&#13;
budgetary allocations between October I and November 15.&#13;
*   The Ministry of Finance presents the Budget to Parliament by November 30.&#13;
*   Parliament approves the Budget by December 31.&#13;
* Approved Budgets are communicated to MDAs and MMDAs by the Ministry of&#13;
Finance by January 31.&#13;
Stage 3: Implementation and Monitorini&#13;
*   Minister of Finance issues General Warrant or if deemed appropriate a Provisional&#13;
warrant authorizing disbursement of approved recurrent expenditure. (FAR 54 and&#13;
55) by Januarv 7.&#13;
*   CAG issues Treasurv Circular to MDAs and Treasuries by January 14.&#13;
*   MDAs issue Financial Encumbrances (FEs) to Treasuries on the basis of the&#13;
approved Budget for recurrent expenditure (FAR 56)&#13;
*   Specific warrant approved by the MEFP issued under authority of respective Sector&#13;
Minister or Head of Department to Controller and Accountant-General of&#13;
disbursement of capital expenditure (FAR 60).&#13;
*   CAG issues Expenditure Authorization (EA) for each capital expenditure.&#13;
*   Respective MDAs and MMDAs manage, monitor, and control expenditure. MOF&#13;
and CAGD direct and coordinate MDA expenditure management, monitoring and&#13;
control.&#13;
*   Ministrv of Finance and CAG control and monitor budgetary performance.&#13;
*   CAGD, MDAs, and MMDAs prepare monthly and annual financial statement and&#13;
reports on the public accounts of Ghana and on other government accounts to Cabinet&#13;
and Parliament no later than three months after the end of the financial year.&#13;
* Auditor-General audits public accounts and other government accounts and submits&#13;
report to Parliament no later than six months after the end of the financial year.&#13;
28.    Role of the CAG. The CAG is responsible for controlling and accounting for the&#13;
approved Budget. The CAG has 160 Treasury Offices serving all MDAs and MMDAs as follows:&#13;
*   13 Ministry Treasuries&#13;
*   2 Pensions Treasuries&#13;
*   1 10 District Treasuries&#13;
*   4 Headquarters Stations&#13;
*   33 Foreign Missions Stations&#13;
29.    Detailed financial activity reports called Cashbook Transcripts are received from these&#13;
Treasuries. There are basically four (4) types:&#13;
*   Payments (Salaries and Wages) Cashbook&#13;
*   Payments (Recurrent Expenditure) Cashbook&#13;
*   Payments (Capital Expenditure) Cashbook&#13;
*   Payments (Debt Servicing) Cashbook&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
* Other Payments (such as Trust Funds, Deposits, and Advances) Cashbook&#13;
* Receipts Cashbook&#13;
30.    Flow of Financial Information and Transactions. The flow of public financial&#13;
transactions is as follows:&#13;
*   Inputsfrom MDAs and MMDAs. These are provided manually in the form of&#13;
Forms, Local Purchase Orders, Stores/Service Receipt Advises, Payment Vouchers,&#13;
Warrants, and other forms. They are submitted to the Treasuries for processing and&#13;
receipt/payment and subsequently recorded in the books of accounts of the MDAs and&#13;
MMDAs.&#13;
*   Processing at the Local Treasury. The Treasuries undertake manual edits,&#13;
verifications, and validation. All financial transactions are entered in manual ledgers&#13;
(called F.E. jackets) and Cashbook transcripts are written weekly (manually) to&#13;
capture all financial transactions during the week. These are then sent to the CAG&#13;
Headquarters on a monthly basis for validation and consolidation.&#13;
-   Processing at CAG Headquarters. Verification, Validation, and Consolidation of&#13;
the Cashbook transcripts received is undertaken by the Data Examinations Section.&#13;
This process is manual. Verified and Validated inputs are input into the mainframe&#13;
computer system. Checks are undertaken to ensure integrity of data which had been&#13;
input. The Main Accounts are then obtained from the system.&#13;
*   Reconciliation. All Government of Ghana cheques are drawn on Bank of Ghana and&#13;
cleared through designated commercial banks where necessary. Each&#13;
Treasury/Finance Office undertakes its bank reconciliation by matching entries made&#13;
in cash books with statements received from servicing banks. Bank statements from&#13;
Bank of Ghana are also reconciled with returns of cheques issued from the&#13;
Treasury/finance offices at the CAGD Head Office.&#13;
31.    Volume of Transactions&#13;
*   Average monthly transactions, in addition to the computerized&#13;
payroll processing number&#13;
*  4,000 Financial Encumbrance (Adjustment)&#13;
*  20,000 Commitment Entries&#13;
* 34,000 Journal Entries&#13;
*  17,000 Cash Payments&#13;
A total of 75,000 financial transactions per month.&#13;
32.    Computer Hardware and Software. The Department currently owns an IBM mainframe&#13;
computer(IBM 9377 Model 80 running on the VSE/SP operating system computer). Other&#13;
operating system software's on it are CICS/VS and DL/I . The system is currently being used to&#13;
prepare the Government payroll and also the Government Accounts. The payroll system is in the&#13;
process of complete migration to a new IBM RISC machine. The Accounts System is in-house&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
developed. The main computer has in all sixty-four (64) dummy terminals and twenty (20)&#13;
personal computers connected directly to it.&#13;
33.   The IBM RISC/6000 runs on AIX UNIX and is networked to about 6 remote sites and&#13;
connected directly to about five (5) Ministries including Ghana Education Service. There are&#13;
about one hundred and twenty (120) personal computers and terminals connected to the system.&#13;
An Integrated Payroll/Personnel package is being installed on it. When this package is fully&#13;
operational, the payroll will be discontinued from the VSE System.&#13;

            expenditures; c) accounting component, permiting the
            classification, recording and analysis of all financial
            transactions; d) cash management component: managing cash
            assets through projections and monitoring of cash flows, and
            providing a basis for the public sector borrowing
            requirements during the year; e) aid and debt management
            component: managing the acquisition, servicing, and
            retirement of internal and external public debt; f) revenue
            component: achieving increased efficiency in the collection,
            reporting, and forecasting of all revenues; g) procurement

            appropriate regard to price competition, quality control and
            administrative expense; and h) auditing component: the
