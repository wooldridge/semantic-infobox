                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Effective learning programs are key to organizational performance and productivity. The&#13;
World Bank's annual learning budget clearly reflects the high priority that the Bank&#13;
places on these programs in an effort to equip staff with the tools needed to meet the&#13;
demands of its work programs. In FY03, for example, the World Bank budgeted $67&#13;
million for a comprehensive range of staff learning opportunities; in FY04 the Bank&#13;
increased its learning budget to $69.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
The Human Development Network's (HDN) Strategic Learning Center (SLC) provides&#13;
professional and technical learning on Human Development (HD)-related topics to HD&#13;
staff throughout the Bank. Each year HDN receives an allocation from the Learning&#13;
Board of just over $2 million for investments in staff learning. This represents about&#13;
eight percent of the overall annual HDN budget. In FY04 alone, HDN invested $2.7&#13;
million, or eight percent of the overall HDN FY04 budget in its formal learning program&#13;
endorsed by the Learning Board.&#13;
&#13;
Given the large budget that HDN allocates to its annual learning programs under the&#13;
Learning Board's directives, the objective of this evaluation is to assess the overall&#13;
effectiveness of HDN learning programs.           The evaluation is comprised of three&#13;
components: (a) a review of HDN staff learning programs; (b) an assessment of the&#13;
effects of the HD Forum 2003; and (c) an assessment of the impact of the Public&#13;
Expenditure Review courses. Considering the size and time frame of each component,&#13;
the evaluation results are presented in three individual reports.&#13;
&#13;
This report focuses on the first component ­ a review of HDN staff learning programs.&#13;
The key evaluation question addressed is, "Is the HDN learning program doing the right&#13;
thing, in terms of the level of alignment with the objectives of the HD Network and&#13;
fulfillment of the HD staff learning needs"? The answer to this question was obtained by&#13;
examining the following four secondary evaluation questions:&#13;
&#13;
       (1)  Did HDN learning programs enhance staff competency?&#13;
&#13;
       (2)  How well are HDN learning programs aligned with HDN business objectives?&#13;
&#13;
       (3)  What is the level of HD staff learning participation?&#13;
&#13;
       (4)  How effective are HDN learning programs?&#13;
&#13;
The evaluation utilized a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches to&#13;
address the above questions, including:&#13;
&#13;
            · Three focus group discussions with 12 HD managers about their&#13;
                expectations and satisfaction with the HDN staff learning programs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     vii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            · A mapping exercise assessing the level of alignment of general HD staff&#13;
               learning needs with the HDN FY04 staff Learning Plan (LP) and program;&#13;
            · A descriptive analysis of HD staff participation over the past 19 months;&#13;
               and&#13;
&#13;
            · An online survey taken by over 300 HD staff regarding their expectations,&#13;
               experiences, and the effect of the learning programs on work performance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       CONCLUSIONS&#13;
&#13;
The primary conclusions of this evaluation are that the HDN learning program largely&#13;
meets HD staff learning needs and has produced some positive impact. However, the&#13;
program is not closely aligned with HDN business objectives. The impact could be&#13;
greater if the HDN learning program were designed in a more demand-driven fashion and&#13;
if it were to provide cutting-edge technical training and make additional efforts to reach&#13;
older, more experienced specialists and country office staff.        These conclusions are&#13;
supported by the following key findings:&#13;
&#13;
HDN learning programs have adequately addressed staff learning needs and&#13;
enhanced staff competency.&#13;
&#13;
Managers expressed satisfaction with the quality and content of HDN learning programs&#13;
and concluded that the programs have addressed, specifically, staff technical and&#13;
operational competency. However, managers felt that staff needs to continue to update&#13;
their technical training, sector-specific training, and operational training. Moreover, the&#13;
LPs are closely aligned with managerial expectations and clearly address staff learning&#13;
needs.&#13;
&#13;
HDN learning programs are only partially aligned with the HDN business&#13;
objectives.&#13;
&#13;
According to HD managers interviewed, all of the Priority Areas listed in the HDN FY04&#13;
LP are in alignment with the overall HDN objectives in someway. However, out of the&#13;
four Priority Areas agreed upon, most managers noted that Priority Areas #1 and #3&#13;
(Integrating HD into multi-sectoral and programmatic lending activities and Following&#13;
up on the World Development Report [WDR] on service delivery) aligned most strongly&#13;
with their work plan. A large share of the managers did not feel that Priority Areas #2&#13;
and #4 (Continuing to pay close attention to issues of portfolio quality and Improving&#13;
momentum toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals) were addressed as&#13;
efficiently.&#13;
&#13;
Most HD staff adequately utilized the learning opportunities available to them.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis of HR data reveals that over 70 percent of HD staff participated at some&#13;
level in the learning programs during FY03 and FY04. On average, most HD staff&#13;
attended between three and four learning events for a total of approximately six days.&#13;
Professional and technical learning are the dominant learning events attended by HD staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
viii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and account for more than 40 percent of total learning event experiences. Moreover, the&#13;
analysis shows that Headquarter (HQ) staff attended more learning activities than staff in&#13;
country offices1, and that older staff, staff with more years of Bank service, and staff at&#13;
higher grade levels participated in very few learning events.&#13;
&#13;
The perceived effectiveness, utilization, and impact of HDN learning programs are&#13;
relatively high.&#13;
             · The perceived quality and effectiveness of HDN learning activities is&#13;
                  relatively high, especially in terms of networking and knowledge sharing.&#13;
             · The Professional Development Grant (PDG) was rated as the most&#13;
                  effective of learning delivery modes, while the least effective delivery&#13;
                  modes, according to the respondents, are E-Learning and B-Span, which&#13;
                  were rated below the mid-point.&#13;
             · Knowledge and concepts are more highly exercised than specific skills&#13;
                  and techniques acquired in the HDN learning activities.&#13;
             · The impact of the HDN learning events was almost exclusively evident in&#13;
                  raising awareness and understanding of the HDN business as opposed to&#13;
                  tangibly affecting the objectives of the Network themselves.&#13;
             · The appropriate type of learning (relevant to work) and the quality and&#13;
                  effectiveness of that learning are more important than the frequency of&#13;
                  learning participation in influencing impact.&#13;
&#13;
                                         RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
Drawing from the key findings and gaps identified in this study, the evaluation offers the&#13;
following recommendations to the HDN staff learning program:&#13;
&#13;
      (1)    Equip staff with more applicable tools and skills;&#13;
&#13;
      (2)    Design learning programs that integrate behavioral components&#13;
             (communication, interpersonal and leadership) with HD operational and&#13;
             technical components;&#13;
&#13;
      (3)    Make the learning more relevant and applicable to staff's daily work by&#13;
             providing more demand-driven, time-sensitive, and cutting-edge learning&#13;
             events;&#13;
&#13;
      (4)    Improve the design of sessions to increase team-based, peer, client and multi-&#13;
             sectoral learning and informal networking;&#13;
&#13;
      (5)    Select and utilize the most welcome and effective of delivery modes, such as&#13;
             Professional Development Grants (PDGs);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1Nonetheless, country office staff, as compared to HQ staff, participate in a slightly greater number of&#13;
learning days per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         ix&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  (6) Explore ways to increase the level of participation of older, more experienced&#13;
      staff and under-privileged learners; and&#13;
&#13;
  (7) Explore ways to make technical learning more readily available to country&#13;
      office staff.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
       1. EVALUATION CONTEXT AND METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
1.1      Effective learning programs are key to organizational performance and&#13;
productivity. The World Bank's annual learning budget clearly reflects the high priority&#13;
that the Bank places on continuous learning and in equipping its staff effectively to meet&#13;
the demands of its work program.&#13;
&#13;
                                              CONTEXT&#13;
&#13;
1.2      The Human Development Network (HDN) is also committed to helping staff&#13;
meet the demands of its work program and to strengthening the contribution of Human&#13;
Development (HD) staff to the overall business of the Bank.                    The HDN Strategic&#13;
Learning Center (SLC) provides professional and technical learning on HD-related topics&#13;
to HD staff throughout the Bank.            HDN learning programs account for nearly four&#13;
percent ($2 million) of the Learning Board's program budget and will provide 40 percent&#13;
of all professional and technical learning in FY04. The $2 million represents about eight&#13;
percent of the overall HDN budget.2 While HDN allocates the bulk of its learning budget&#13;
to the preparation and delivery of formal HD learning events such as Bank Operations&#13;
and professional and technical, Information and Technology (IT), and HR-related&#13;
learning events, it also provides other staff learning opportunities, such as knowledge&#13;
fairs, Brown Bag Lunches (BBLs), and Professional Development Grants (PDGs), which&#13;
tailor learning opportunities to individual staff needs. In addition to formal courses,&#13;
HDN spends around ten percent of its learning budget to host a bi-annual conference-&#13;
style forum or "Sector Week," around which it concentrates a high volume of its class-&#13;
based learning events.&#13;
&#13;
1.3      As part of its FY04 work program agreement with the Learning Board, the World&#13;
Bank Institute Evaluation Group (IEG) conducted an evaluation of the HDN learning&#13;
programs. Given the large budget the HDN allocates to its annual learning programs&#13;
under the Learning Board's directives, the objective of the evaluation is to assess the&#13;
effectiveness of overall HDN learning programs.&#13;
&#13;
1.4      This evaluation was designed in consultation with the HDN learning group to be&#13;
comprised of three separate components: (a) a review of the HDN staff learning program;&#13;
(b) an assessment of the effects of the HD Forum 2003 on participating staff; and (c) an&#13;
assessment of the impact of the Public Expenditure Review courses. Considering the size&#13;
and timeframe of each component, the evaluation results of each component are&#13;
presented in three individual reports.&#13;
&#13;
2In fact, HDN invests much more in staff learning. For example, the many Quality Enhancement Reviews&#13;
(QERs) conducted by the HD-Hub often amounts to staff learning at its best--team-based action learning.&#13;
Yet the considerable budget going into QERs is not formally considered part of the staff-learning budget.&#13;
Many other services of the Hub also entail significant staff-learning components, but are generally&#13;
classified in other ways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.5      This report presents the evaluation results of the first component--a review of&#13;
HDN staff learning programs.&#13;
&#13;
                                            EVALUATION QUESTIONS&#13;
&#13;
1.6      The key evaluation issue addressed by this report is, "Is the HDN learning&#13;
program doing the right thing, in terms of the level of alignment with the objectives of the&#13;
HD Network and fulfillment of the HD staff learning needs?" The evaluation question&#13;
stated above is examined from both supply and demand perspectives. On the supply side,&#13;
the evaluation addresses whether or not the HDN learning programs planned reflect HDN&#13;
business objectives and adequately address staff needs.                              On the demand side, the&#13;
evaluation attempts to determine the effectiveness and impact of the HDN learning&#13;
program on HD staff and on the HDN business objectives. Specifically, the evaluation&#13;
examines the following four broad evaluation questions:&#13;
&#13;
       (1)     Did HDN learning programs enhance staff competency?&#13;
&#13;
       (2)     How well are HDN learning programs aligned with HDN business objectives?&#13;
&#13;
       (3)     What is the level of HD staff learning participation?&#13;
&#13;
       (4)     How effective are HDN learning programs?&#13;
&#13;

                                          METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
1.8      Four evaluation activities were carried out during the evaluation phase to address&#13;
above evaluation questions including:&#13;
&#13;
       (1)   Focus groups and individual interviews with HD managers and senior staff.&#13;
&#13;
             · The purpose of this activity was to collect feedback regarding the&#13;
                 alignment of HDN learning programs with HDN business objectives and&#13;
                 to determine whether or not the learning is meeting the needs of the staff.&#13;
&#13;
       (2)   A desk review of the HDN learning activities offered in FY03­04.&#13;
             · The objective of this exercise was to assess how well the HDN learning&#13;
                 programs offered reflect the objectives of the HDN work program in terms&#13;
                 of improving HD staff key competencies.&#13;
&#13;
       (3)   An analysis of HD staff learning participation over the past 19 months.&#13;
             · The purpose of this analysis was to determine the degree of HD staff&#13;
                 learning participation.&#13;
&#13;
       (4)   An online staff survey with HD staff.&#13;
             · The staff survey seeks information from HD staff about their learning&#13;
                 experiences, particularly the impact of HD-Hub (HDN) learning&#13;
                 programs.3&#13;
&#13;
1.9      Detailed descriptions of each of the above methods are presented in their&#13;
respective sections.&#13;
&#13;
                                            LIMITATIONS&#13;
&#13;
1.10     As with any evaluation, this study is not without its limitations. As a result,&#13;
readers are encouraged to exercise caution in interpreting the findings herein for the&#13;
following reasons:&#13;
&#13;
1.11     The evaluation attempts to distinguish between HD staff learning demand and&#13;
supply. HD staff demands are placed not only on the HDN learning program, but also on&#13;
Human Resources (HR) behavioral types and Operations learning programs. In addition,&#13;
the HDN learning programs supply HD focused learning, but not exclusively to HD staff.&#13;
In other words, the fact that HDN learning programs supplied throughout FY03­04 are&#13;
not targeted exclusively to HD staff must be taken into consideration when attempting to&#13;
determine the overall relationship between demand and supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3The HD Anchor was in the spring of 2004 renamed to the HD-Hub. To differentiate between learning&#13;
events organized by regional HD sector units and those organized by the HDN learning program, we use&#13;
the term "HD-Hub learning " to refer the HDN learning program in the staff survey. Thus, both terms, HD-&#13;
Hub learning and HDN learning, are used simultaneously and interchangeably in this report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.12   Further, the participant reports presented in the results section of the mapping&#13;
exercise should not be taken as exact, but rather as approximate indicators of the&#13;
alignment between the learning demand and the supply of learning by the HDN learning&#13;
program for two reasons.      First, the data resulting from the mapping exercise is&#13;
incomplete. Second, because HDN does not categorize its offerings into separate areas or&#13;
groups, the mapping results were subjective.&#13;
&#13;
                              STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT&#13;
&#13;
1.13   Following this chapter, the report consists of five chapters:&#13;
           · Chapter II presents the results of interviews with 12 HD managers.&#13;
&#13;
           · Chapter III compares the HDN FY04 Learning Plan (LP) with the actual&#13;
              events conducted, level of staff participation, and manager-identified key&#13;
              HD staff competency, expectations and learning needs expressed in&#13;
              Chapter II;&#13;
           · Chapter IV provides an analysis of the level of participation and types of&#13;
              staff learning activities and events conducted throughout FY03-04.&#13;
           · Chapter V presents staff survey results focusing on the effectiveness,&#13;
              utilization, and impact of the learning activities offered by the HDN&#13;
              learning program; and&#13;
&#13;
           · Chapter VI provides a collective summary of the results and&#13;
              recommendations based on this evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
1.14   The information derived from Chapters II, III and V will insightfully address the&#13;
effectiveness of the learning programs from demand perspectives. Whereas Chapter III&#13;
complements these findings with an assessment of how the HDN learning programs have&#13;
been planned and delivered effectively.&#13;

 2. ALIGNMENT OF HDN LEARNING PROGRAMS WITH&#13;
      HDN OBJECTIVES: ACCORDING TO MANAGERS&#13;
&#13;
2.1     This chapter presents the evaluation results concerning the alignment of HDN&#13;
learning programs with HDN business objectives (work program). The main source of&#13;
this assessment is information collected from HD manager focus groups and interviews.&#13;
&#13;
                               METHODS AND INSTRUMENT&#13;
&#13;
2.2     All HD managers received an email from the manager of the IEG inviting them to&#13;
participate in focus groups and individual interviews to share their views on the&#13;
effectiveness of the HDN learning program. A total of 12 HD managers agreed to&#13;
participate. Three focus groups and three individual interviews lasting approximately&#13;
two hours were conducted.&#13;
&#13;
2.3     These 12 managers were evenly spread across regions and HD sectors. Each of&#13;
the six regions was represented by at least one manager, while two HD managers&#13;
attended from the Human Development Network Vice Presidential Unit (HDNVPU) and&#13;
the World Bank Institute Human Development (WBIHD). The managers involved had&#13;
no less than ten years total Bank experience, though the levels of managerial experience&#13;
ranged from one to 11 years in the following categories: manager, sector manager, senior&#13;
adviser, and country or sector director.&#13;
&#13;
2.4     A questionnaire (see Annex 1) comprised of four broad, open-ended questions&#13;
was developed to guide the focus group discussions and individual interviews.&#13;
Additionally, managers were provided with a copy of the HDN FY04 LP. The focus&#13;
groups and interviews explore the following questions:&#13;
&#13;
      (1)   What are the key competencies required for working in HD?&#13;
&#13;
      (2)   How satisfied are HD managers that the current HDN learning programs have:&#13;
&#13;
            · addressed the key competencies required for staff to fulfill the&#13;
               requirements of the HDN work program?&#13;
&#13;
            · met the perceived individual learning needs of HD staff?&#13;
&#13;
      (3)   What do managers expect from the HDN learning programs?&#13;
&#13;
      (4)   How well are HDN learning programs aligned withHDN business objectives?&#13;
&#13;
                KEY COMPETENCIES NECESSARY FOR WORKING IN HD&#13;
&#13;
2.5     During the focus groups, managers identified: a) three HD sector-specific&#13;
technical competencies, and b) three general competencies, which, in their view are&#13;
necessary for staff to function effectively in the HD Network. Managers felt that in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
addition to sector-specific technical competencies and general competencies, HD&#13;
Network staff needed to be on the cutting-edge in their respective fields, which requires&#13;
continuous learning.&#13;
&#13;
2.6      A list of the key competencies identified by the managers interviewed is&#13;
summarized in Table 2. For the purposes of this study, we merged Technical Specialty -&#13;
Economics, etc. and HD Sector Specific Competencies to form one category ultimately&#13;
designated as Sector-Specific.         Though the column titled New and Cutting-edge&#13;
Knowledge is not categorized as a competency, it is included because managers cited it as&#13;
crucial to the seven competencies they were asked to identify. Therefore, it is treated in&#13;
the study as a separate category. An "X" indicates that the competency was mentioned&#13;
by the managers.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HD specific competencies&#13;
&#13;
2.7      HD specific competencies consist of: (1) a core set of HD sector-specific&#13;
competencies, (2) a set of cross-sectoral or multi-sectoral competencies, and (3) basic&#13;
operational competencies.&#13;
&#13;
HD sector specific/technical competencies&#13;
&#13;
2.8      The competency most frequently mentioned as necessary for functioning&#13;
effectively in HD sectors was a set of HD sector-specific competencies. Almost all of the&#13;
12 managers interviewed (N = 11) felt that in order for staff to function effectively in the&#13;
HD Network, they needed to have, in the words of one the managers, "very narrow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
technical HD sector-specific competencies, depending on which sector specific issues&#13;
they are working on".&#13;
&#13;
2.9     Some managers felt that sector-specific competencies alone were not enough to&#13;
function effectively in HD. In their view, it is essential for staff to have a mix of sector-&#13;
specific and technical competencies. The most frequently named technical competency&#13;
was pure economics.&#13;
&#13;
    "...I think one of the problems that we face in our multi-sectoral lending is that it&#13;
    is dominated by our macro economists, and in order to be credible, quite often it&#13;
    doesn't mean that there is a 100 percent correlation, but a strong correlation that&#13;
    an economist is better able to do that. ...I think you need a mix of the two&#13;
    [economics and sectoral expertise]."&#13;
&#13;
2.10    Most managers, however, felt that although pure economists are useful to the&#13;
Network, possessing "very narrow sector-specific technical competencies" related to&#13;
Health, Nutrition and Population (HNP), Social Protection (SP) and Education is far more&#13;
essential for HD staff.      "Staff", according to one manger, "must be technically&#13;
knowledgeable about their area.       If they are in Education, they must understand&#13;
education, if they are in Health, also health. ...They need to know what they are talking&#13;
about when they go to a minister of health or minister of education."&#13;
&#13;
Multi-sectoral/integrated competencies&#13;
&#13;
2.11    The competency mentioned by managers second-most frequently as critical to&#13;
functioning effectively within HD was multi-sectoral or integrated competency. Ten&#13;
managers felt that, in addition to having core HD sector-specific technical competencies,&#13;
staff should be able to work effectively multi-sectorally. Working multi-sectorally or&#13;
integratively means that HD staff need to be familiar with the work of their colleagues as&#13;
well as with the work conducted by sectors outside of HD. "[HD needs] people who&#13;
work on multi-sectoral programs which, a lot of the times happens to be expenditures as&#13;
it relates to outcomes in our sector, as opposed to being pure specialist type of things. I&#13;
think you need an economist that's literate in the field and a specialist who is literate as&#13;
an economist. So you need people who can build bridges and integrate ideas. You need&#13;
people who can walk on both feet," according to one Africa Region (AFR) senior sector&#13;
manager.&#13;
&#13;
2.12    When considering how HDN can effectively accomplish the objectives articulated&#13;
in its FY04 LP, particularly Priority Area # 1, "Integrating HD into Multi-Sectoral and&#13;
Programmatic Lending Activities", and Priority Area # 3, "Following up on the WDR on&#13;
Service Delivery", most managers felt that HD staff need to be able to work cross-&#13;
sectorally. Essentially, HDN needs not only staff literate in the field of economics, but&#13;
also staff possessing key HD sector-specific competencies in order to effectively&#13;
integrate narrow, sector-specific technical skills with skills outside of their own areas of&#13;
expertise and to broaden Network-wide awareness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.13    Overall, HD managers feel that HD staff need to broaden the scope of their&#13;
understanding of the HD Network to include the work done by their colleagues not only&#13;
in HD, but also in other sectors outside of the HD. In that way, HD staff will be able to&#13;
lead multi-sectoral lending dialogues and promote HD products. More specifically,&#13;
according to one manager, "they need to be open-minded to deal with multi-sectoral&#13;
programmatic lending". Open-mindedness, according to another manager, requires that&#13;
HD staff are willing to work with colleagues in other sectors so as to "have an&#13;
understanding of the context of their specialty, and how it links with HD". Staff also&#13;
need to "...understand the Sector, what are the key players in the Sector so that they can&#13;
have an understanding and have an effective dialogue...for the non-economist they need&#13;
to have enough of an understanding of the macro picture, then there are things that&#13;
depend on the Sector, like health...good practices, etc."    More importantly, working&#13;
multi-sectorally requires that HD staff learn "how you relate to clients, how you really&#13;
integrate your sector with a country driven agenda," says another manager.&#13;
&#13;
Operational competencies&#13;
&#13;
2.14    Six managers interviewed cited operational competencies as key to working&#13;
within the HD Network. Though some managers differentiated between core operational&#13;
competencies and generic operational competencies, the following basic operational&#13;
competencies necessary for all new staff are agreed upon:&#13;
&#13;
            · Internal Bank procedures;&#13;
            · Budget;&#13;
&#13;
            · Portfolio management;&#13;
            · Basic safeguards;&#13;
&#13;
            · Basic tool kits.&#13;
&#13;
2.15    Managers also identified the following more advanced operational competencies,&#13;
which have built in technical and multi-sectoral components:&#13;
            · Public Expenditure Reviews (PER);&#13;
&#13;
            · Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP); and&#13;
            · Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSC).&#13;
&#13;
New and cutting-edge skills competencies: continuous learning&#13;
&#13;
2.16    In addition to the core technical and sector competencies noted above, six of the&#13;
HD managers interviewed also considered it crucial that HD staff be life-long or&#13;
continuous learners. Being a lifelong learner, according to the managers interviewed,&#13;
requires that HD staff expand their knowledge base so as to stay on the cutting-edge of&#13;
their technical sector-specific specialties.&#13;
&#13;
2.17    Continuous learning requires a certain amount of open-mindedness and humility&#13;
on the part of the HD staff. They need to be willing to admit that they lack certain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
information and to be open to learning from others. "...You know what you don't know,"&#13;
says one manager, "[you should be] humble enough to bring in other people," says&#13;
another. "[You should]...open your mind to other things and other ways of doing things.&#13;
It really helps them [new staff] gain competence and in getting a sense of themselves,"&#13;
suggests a third manager.&#13;
&#13;
2.18    Managers recommended that staff seek out new and cutting-edge knowledge by&#13;
looking to experienced peers, managers and clients for mentoring and coaching outside&#13;
the bank.&#13;
&#13;
General non-HD specific competencies&#13;
&#13;
2.19    Managers also suggest that HD staff develop general non-HD specific&#13;
competencies in order to be at their most effective both within and outside HD. Most&#13;
managers (N = 9) felt that HD staff needed to complement their narrow set of&#13;
technical/sector-specific competencies with general non-sector related competencies.&#13;
Table 2 shows the four general non-HD competencies that managers considered crucial&#13;
for effectiveness. The top-most competencies mentioned are:&#13;
            · Team building;&#13;
&#13;
            · General leadership; and&#13;
            · Behavioral&#13;
&#13;
Team building competencies&#13;
&#13;
2.20    Eight managers considered team building as the most crucial of the non-technical&#13;
skill competencies necessary for working effectively in HD. Network managers felt that&#13;
since one of the key Priority Areas of the HDN FY04 LP is integrating HD into multi-&#13;
sectoral and programmatic lending, it is important that HD staff be able to relate to one&#13;
another, as well as to clients and partners. More importantly, staff need to be active in a&#13;
multi-sectoral team environment. In order for this to happen, some managers pointed out,&#13;
staff need to be "humble enough" to admit to limitations and willing to learn from peers,&#13;
supervisors, and clients. Learning from each other means developing good listening&#13;
skills, which, in the managers' views, is crucial for working together in multi-sectoral&#13;
teams. The following comments from one sector manager echo the sentiments of his&#13;
colleagues:&#13;
&#13;
    "One skill that is becoming very important in the Bank is interpersonal skills,&#13;
    because of the evolving nature of our work, where we work in multi-sectoral&#13;
    teams, multi-skill teams, etc., it is very important that one is able to function in&#13;
    that kind of environment because you are not working alone you are working&#13;
    together with others. ...So, because our task managers or members of our teams&#13;
    work in multi-sectoral teams and multi-sector dimensional teams, because of&#13;
    these multi-sectoral teams, it is very crucial that they have good interpersonal&#13;
    skills."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    "And the interpersonal skills go way beyond just working with other Bank staff.&#13;
    Also, how do they deal with the clients. Because if they don't know how to deal&#13;
    with the clients, I have seen very many staff, in other words, staff who have very&#13;
    good technical skills, very strong Bank operational skills, fall flat because their&#13;
    interpersonal skills in teams were very bad. Their interpersonal skills with the&#13;
    clients were very bad. So, these skills, some of them, are invisible but they are&#13;
    very crucial."&#13;
&#13;
2.21    Apart from good listening skills, which was perceived as "the real shortfall of&#13;
staff", another important aspect of team building, in managers' views, is the ability to be&#13;
able to communicate effectively with team members. Effective communication means&#13;
not only good listening skills, but also the ability to:&#13;
            · write well;&#13;
&#13;
            · lead dialogues with colleagues and clients;&#13;
            · be well versed on the effectiveness of the HD product issues discussed in&#13;
               those dialogues; and&#13;
            · demonstrate competency when doing so, instead of adopting a "bleeding&#13;
               hearts approach".&#13;
&#13;
2.22    All managers observed that informal networking at HD Fora was one of the most&#13;
effective means by which HD staff could strengthen relationships and build stronger&#13;
multi-sectoral teams. Informal networking is also viewed as a good vehicle for team-&#13;
based and client learning. Informal networking is considered so valuable for building&#13;
stronger teams that managers confirmed that more than half of their learning budget was&#13;
allocated to bringing staff from country offices to HQ and other country offices so that&#13;
they could network with both their counterparts and other colleagues. The following&#13;
extracts from one of the managers focus groups suggest the value managers ascribe to&#13;
informal networking as it relates to team building:&#13;
&#13;
    "We spent more than 50 percent of the budget this year [FY04] on the HD Week&#13;
    and the Pre HD Week, Learning Week. And we brought everybody from the field&#13;
    offices for two weeks here. So that was partly to give them exposure. ...Two&#13;
    thirds of our staff are in the country office. So for us, it is important to bring them&#13;
    here and to give them exposure, to see what's going on here in Headquarters. So,&#13;
    I think that is the major motivation. My Director was very keen that everybody&#13;
    should come for two weeks. And we also take advantage of that for the work&#13;
    program."&#13;
&#13;
    "We had an unbearable cost. We had a training budget of $318,000 of which&#13;
    $169,000 of that was spent on HD Week. That put a huge dent on our budget and&#13;
    I think we are not convinced that that is the best way of spending our money but&#13;
    staff came because it is an opportunity to network. We have over 50 percent of&#13;
    our staff in the field. It is an opportunity to better integrate and build stronger&#13;
    teams in the process.       And we tied our own training on Operations to the&#13;
    Learning Week. We had our own day set aside for improving Operations. And I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    think we had a retreat for the HDN family. So we integrate this and we did a lot&#13;
    of different things having everybody here. So we accomplished a lot of objectives&#13;
    in the process some of which were associated with what we are doing."&#13;
&#13;
General leadership competencies&#13;
&#13;
2.23    The second-most frequently mentioned non-technical competency cited as crucial&#13;
for effectiveness within HDN was general leadership. Seven of the 12 HD managers&#13;
considered possessing general leadership skills competency to be crucial for HD staff&#13;
effectiveness in the Network, particularly as it relates to integrating HD with multi-&#13;
sectoral and programmatic lending activities. General leadership, according to the&#13;
managers interviewed, consists of the following:&#13;
             · Putting together teams of people with a variety of skills;&#13;
&#13;
             · Successfully communicating the effectiveness of [HD] products to clients&#13;
                and partners;&#13;
             · Communicating competently with clients the contents of HD projects,&#13;
                versus taking "the bleeding-hearts approach"; and&#13;
             · Having effective multi-sectoral dialogues on programmatic lending.&#13;
&#13;
2.24    Managers felt that in order for HDN to fulfill its LP business objectives for FY04&#13;
it is essential for staff to take a leadership role in the aforementioned areas.        The&#13;
following comments from these two managers typify overall views:&#13;
&#13;
    "[HD Staff needs to know] how to put together teams of people with a mix of&#13;
    skills...how to lead a dialogue with cultural and political knowledge and&#13;
    sensitivity. They need ...some maturity in making judgments."&#13;
&#13;
    "We need to have staff who are aware of structural adjustment loans within our&#13;
    sectors, that are trained and able to lead them in the effectiveness of our products.&#13;
    That is for lending as well as for our sectoral ones."&#13;
&#13;
Behavioral competencies&#13;
&#13;
2.25    The third-most frequently mentioned competency necessary for effectively&#13;
functioning in HD sectors is behavioral.            Six managers cited behavioral skill&#13;
competencies as crucial to team building.       Managers mentioned several behaviors as&#13;
crucial. Among them were:&#13;
&#13;
             · humility in dealing with peers and clients;&#13;
             · open-mindedness to alternative methodologies;&#13;
&#13;
             · willingness to learn from others;&#13;
             · willingness to accept limitations;&#13;
&#13;
             · willingness to get involved; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            · maturity in judgment.&#13;
&#13;
                              KEY LEARNING NEEDSOF STAFF&#13;
&#13;
2.26    Based on what managers believed to be the competencies most conducive to&#13;
successful work within HD sectors, the managers developed a set of staff learning needs.&#13;
These needs point to the gaps that currently exist in overall staff efficiency. As presented&#13;
in Table 3, managers' perception of staff learning needs is consistent with their expressed&#13;
views on the staff competencies and their expectations from the learning program, as&#13;
discussed in the following section.&#13;
&#13;
                    Table 3: Managers' view on staff learning needs&#13;
&#13;
                                   Managers' views on learning required for working in HD&#13;

                                                                        Team&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
2.27    Most managers identified integrated or multi-sectoral and operational learning as&#13;
the two top-most learning needs necessary for HD staff to function effectively in the&#13;
Network. Managers also identified two types of general non-HD learning as crucial for&#13;
staff effectiveness: 1) team building; and 2) leadership training. These two learning&#13;
areas, particularly team building, focus mainly on interpersonal skills.                           Managers&#13;
perceived these types of learning as important because: 1) these are the areas which&#13;
receive attention in the staff overall performance evaluation; and 2) they are necessary for&#13;
working in a multi-sectoral environment and for working effectively with clients and&#13;
partners.&#13;
&#13;
2.28    It must be noted that although leadership learning often includes team building as&#13;
a learning focus area, in this study, the two are categorized separately because most&#13;
managers perceived them as different types of training.                    Another reason why team&#13;
building and leadership learning are separated is because team building incorporates&#13;
informal networking as a key component. When managers talked about building stronger&#13;
teams, they often mentioned informal networking as key to developing and strengthening&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
working relationships, which then results in team building. The next chapter examines&#13;
what kind of team building learning is provided to HD staff. As we will see, most of the&#13;
HD team building comes from the informal networking at the HD Forum.&#13;
&#13;
2.29     Most managers discussed general leadership learning in terms of project and&#13;
program leadership and oral and written communication. Specifically, some managers&#13;
felt that staff need to be trained to take the lead on projects concerning programmatic&#13;
lending and to head dialogues with clients on the effectiveness of HD programs.&#13;
&#13;
            MANAGERS' SATISFACTION WITH THEHDN LEARNING PROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
2.30    The    above   sections  presented    and    examined    manager-designated     key&#13;
competencies and staff learning needs. In this section, we reveal what the HD managers&#13;
expect from the HDN learning program, specifically, whether or not it:&#13;
            · addresses the key competencies required by staff; and&#13;
&#13;
            · meets staff learning needs.&#13;
&#13;
Managers' expectations of HDN learning programs&#13;
&#13;
2.31    In order to determine the shortcomings of the HDN learning programs, we&#13;
compared the HD staff competencies identified by managers as crucial to optimal staff&#13;
performance with managers' expectations of the HDN learning programs.&#13;
&#13;
2.32    Table 4 presents a breakdown of what managers expected their staff to learn while&#13;
attending HDN learning programs.          As previously discussed, technical/operational&#13;
learning includes learning in the Bank's operational framework, function and policies.&#13;
Professional and technical learning focus on topics such as economics, finance, statistics,&#13;
and learning in HD sector-specific topics such as health, education and social protection.&#13;
Team building learning and leadership learning usually address interpersonal skills such&#13;
as effective communication (both oral and written) and listening skills. These topics are&#13;
generally covered in leadership training.     However, while team building learning is&#13;
designed to meet the needs of all staff, the target audience for leadership learning is staff&#13;
with leadership and management functions.&#13;
&#13;
2.33    The findings suggest that most managers expected the HDN to provide its staff&#13;
with technical/operational, team building and leadership training.      More importantly,&#13;
however, managers expected the learning to be:&#13;
            · tailored to HD staff needs and just-in-time;&#13;
&#13;
            · integrated and multi-sectoral; and&#13;
            · new and cutting-edge.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
2.34    All managers reported that they expect HDN to provide just-in-time learning&#13;
tailored to meet the needs of HD staff, rather than supply-driven training, which is not&#13;
necessarily relevant to the needs of their staff. Managers asserted that learning tailored to&#13;
meet the needs of staff would definitely have the advantage over the kind of generic&#13;
learning that the staff are currently receiving. Tailored learning would include good&#13;
practices and lessons learned from country offices, clients and partners. In particular,&#13;
managers expressed dissatisfaction with the type of supply-driven, technical learning&#13;
presented by the HDN-Hub at the HD Forum. They felt that with more planning and&#13;
consultation with staff to ascertain their need, the HDN learning program could be&#13;
designed to be more relevant to meet the learning needs of the staff.&#13;
&#13;
2.35    In the following comment, it is suggested that HD staff, perhaps more&#13;
experienced HD staff [italics are authors'], should be encouraged to get more involved in&#13;
the design and delivery of learning to their colleagues. In that way, they would be able to&#13;
share with their colleagues just-in-time knowledge and information. Her comments&#13;
reflect the views of most managers.&#13;
&#13;
     "Instead of focusing on delivering, tailor things. I would like to see a lot more on&#13;
     demand things...respond to people's work...it sort of forces people to walk out of&#13;
     their comfort zones. Put staff in charge to prepare a series of ten dialogues over&#13;
     a 10-month period. I bet that would work. ...So I am betting on the demand side&#13;
     big time in terms for them [staff] to figure out what they know."&#13;
&#13;
2.36    Managers identified budget allocation and poor planning as part of the reason that&#13;
HDN tends to lean toward supply-driven rather than demand-driven training. The&#13;
following comment articulates some of the frustrations managers are experiencing in&#13;
terms of their unmet expectations from the learning program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    "What frustrates me sometimes is that at the beginning of the year we try to&#13;
    define what our learning needs are going to be for the year. And we would like&#13;
    the funds to be allocated for what we have found are our priorities...top&#13;
    priorities...we would like for those to be financed for you, right? Instead we are&#13;
    having problems getting these things financed for you out of our learning budget.&#13;
    But yet, during the year, we find that, every now and again, there will be a notice&#13;
    going around saying, "there's going to be the following training, workshop here&#13;
    there and everywhere and can you nominate people to come." So there's money&#13;
    sloshing around but it is not directed at what we would necessarily like. But there&#13;
    is a mismatch. ...So we decided to take charge of it [the training] because before&#13;
    we were sort of passive and courses were flying out of the sky here and&#13;
    there...and we'd say let's have people sign up for this and that. And it's like,&#13;
    hello, this is a big chunk of cash here and we need to see how we can get the max&#13;
    out of it."&#13;
&#13;
2.37    The findings suggest that managers expect HDN learning programs to adapt a&#13;
more multi-sector focused approach to their learning design and delivery. This approach&#13;
was advocated instead of a uni-sectoral, or compartmentalized, approach in support of the&#13;
top-most priority area stipulated by HDN FY04 LP, or the integration of HD into multi-&#13;
sectoral and programmatic lending activities. These three managers strongly expressed&#13;
integrative learning as one of their expectations from the HDN learning program:&#13;
&#13;
    "I think they need to bump up those courses a little bit.         They need some&#13;
    integration of these courses."&#13;
&#13;
    "HDN needs to get more thematic across sectors, the way PREM has gone..."&#13;
&#13;
    "People need to understand that it is about results on the ground, how you relate&#13;
    to clients, how you really integrate your sector with a country driven agenda.&#13;
    This is a different Bank."&#13;
&#13;
Managers' satisfaction with HDN learning programs&#13;
&#13;
2.38    Most managers were partially convinced that the HDN learning program was&#13;
addressing the key competencies that HD staff needed to function effectively in the HD&#13;
Network. However, they were satisfied that the technical learning and the core-sector&#13;
specific learning were addressing only key technical competencies. Moreover, they felt&#13;
that the program could do better in addressing two key HD specific competencies:&#13;
operational and multi-sectoral and two non-HD specific competencies: team building and&#13;
leadership. Of the 12 managers, only two strongly expressed dissatisfaction with the&#13;
learning program.&#13;
&#13;
 ALIGNMENT OF THE HDN FY04 LEARNING PLAN WITH THE HDN WORK PROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
2.39    Managers were invited to express their views on how well the HDN FY04 LP&#13;
aligns with HDN business objectives as reflected by its overall work program.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
2.41     According to the managers, all of the Priority Areas listed in the HDN FY04 LP&#13;
are somewhat aligned with the HDN work program. However, of the four Priority Areas&#13;
designated, most managers acknowledged that the strongest alignment is with Areas #1&#13;
and #3. A large share of the managers did not consider Priority Areas #2 and #4 to be&#13;
well aligned with their work programs. This manager's comments capture managers'&#13;
overall views on how well aligned the Priority Areas articulated in the FY04 LP are with&#13;
the HDN work program.&#13;
&#13;
     "...well I would say that because we've been working very closely with WBI, I&#13;
     think that the first one is the one that we really have been focusing on, which is&#13;
     integrating HD, because we see a great need for that and we are lacking in that&#13;
     department. But I think that three and four I don't think we have been focusing&#13;
     enough on these: service delivery and MDGs, that is my sense. But that is partly&#13;
     reflected in our priorities as articulated to say the WBI and to ourselves. We've&#13;
     been really focusing a lot on number one."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.42    The overall consensus is that in terms of improving the quality of the portfolio&#13;
there are so many factors needed to strengthen the learning program, learning being only&#13;
one, that it is difficult to target the key areas in need of improvement. In fact, one&#13;
manager explained that portfolio quality is not treated as a learning event because it is a&#13;
process-oriented activity. Managers reported that MDGs are in the work program mainly&#13;
to raise staff awareness of the importance of key concepts. One manager expressed the&#13;
view that the only component of the MDGs in alignment with their work program are the&#13;
MDGs Plus.&#13;
&#13;
Well-aligned Priority Areas: Priority Areas #1 and #3&#13;
&#13;
Priority Area #1 - Integrating HD into multi-sectoral and programmatic lending&#13;
activities&#13;
&#13;
2.43    The top-most Priority Area that HD managers agreed is closely aligned with their&#13;
work program is Priority Area #1. According to one manager, "In South Asia, we are&#13;
moving on programmatic lending. We are trying to work more closely with PREM. We&#13;
are trying to integrate into the ongoing broad agenda of the region." Other regions are&#13;
also focusing on integrating HD into multi-sectoral and programmatic lending. The&#13;
quote below reflects the overall view of the managers interviewed:&#13;
&#13;
    "I think that the first [priority] is the one that we really have been focusing on,&#13;
    because we see a great need for that and we are lacking in that department.&#13;
    We've been really focusing on number one. We've had two HDN PRSP training&#13;
    workshops. The first one in Addis and the second one in Nairobi where we&#13;
    brought together government counterparts and Bank teams to work together."&#13;
&#13;
2.44    Of the seven managers who reported that the four Priority Areas identified in the&#13;
FY04 LP are well aligned with the HDN work program, only two felt that integrating HD&#13;
with multi-sectoral lending activities does not closely align with the HDN work program.&#13;
One of these two surmised that since Priority Area #1 is new to HDN, it is not surprising&#13;
that this component of the program is not yet fully developed. The other manager felt&#13;
that HDN is performing poorly in all four Priority Areas. To elaborate, he said, "one of&#13;
the biggest problems I face is trying to get people to work multi-sectorally for work&#13;
program reasons." He cited lack of budget as the major contributor to this problem.&#13;
&#13;
2.45    In summary, the HD managers interviewed agreed that integrating HD with other&#13;
sectors and programmatic lending activities is priority number one on their work program&#13;
activities for FY04. Managers confirmed that they are "moving more and more to work&#13;
that involves either multi-sectoral approaches and/or programmatic lending instruments,&#13;
rather than traditional approaches."&#13;
&#13;
Priority Area #3 - Following up on WDR on service delivery&#13;
&#13;
2.46    The second Priority that the HD managers felt is aligned most closely with their&#13;
work program is Priority Area #3. Managers identifying this Priority Area cited the&#13;
delivery of services to the poor as the major focus of the HD Network. The following&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
extracts from narratives provided by two managers typify the overall view on how well&#13;
the learning programmeets the needs of their work programs:&#13;
&#13;
   "[Priority Area] number three is directly related to what we are doing. They are&#13;
   trying to do service delivery in a different way. It is a different orientation."&#13;
&#13;
   "It's [WDR] so important that we are doing one for our region. We are doing&#13;
   something...customized, WDR for LCR countries...it has been useful...we did a&#13;
   learning event trying to get the PDLM useful for us. We started with health to see&#13;
   if it works. They started something with a colleague called "Health dialogue&#13;
   series" in Latin America. And the first of those was on how to apply the WDR&#13;
   framework to health services and improving health outcomes in Andean&#13;
   countries. And it was great and very useful. I think that is the sort of thing that&#13;
   would tell you whether this is being effective or not. ...I think at least our&#13;
   department and [several others] all had sessions in their departmental retreats&#13;
   this year about the WDR to raise awareness and pass on."&#13;
&#13;
Poorly aligned Priority Areas: Priority Areas #2 and #4&#13;
&#13;
Priority Area # 2 - Continuing to place close attention on issues of portfolio quality&#13;
&#13;
2.47    HD managers had very different views regarding the alignment of Priority Areas&#13;
#2 and #4 with the FY04 work program. Most felt that although these two Priority Areas&#13;
are in accordance with the HDN work program in theory, in practice, not enough&#13;
emphasis is placed on training staff in these areas as there is in Priority Areas #1 and #3.&#13;
Commentary on how the LP addresses portfolio quality was very vague. One manager&#13;
was confused as to why Continuing to place close attention to issues of portfolio quality&#13;
was included in the FY04 LP:&#13;
&#13;
   "I'm trying to figure out what are we talking about when we put this as part of the&#13;
   Learning Plan. Whether what are the instruments they are thinking here. We&#13;
   usually for example as a matter of agreement use peer reviewers from the network&#13;
   in every single thing we do so that there is a learning...I'm not sure if they do the&#13;
   same in other sectors. Or are they talking about systematic kind of training&#13;
   things? I know they have done several courses on how to prepare ICR's and that&#13;
   sort of thing. I'm not sure what the content is of [Priority Area] number two."&#13;
&#13;
2.48    In general, managers felt that it was difficult to determine the impact of Priority&#13;
Area #2 because the indicators are long term.&#13;
&#13;
   "...it seems to me, you can get some shorter term indicators that although you&#13;
   don't know what people actually learn, you could approach a big proxy somehow&#13;
   that would be useful to Operations to see what they are getting out of this."&#13;
&#13;
2.49    One manager felt that although staff may understand the importance of improving&#13;
portfolio quality, it is an ongoing issue and as such learning has to be ongoing as well. In&#13;
his view, it is difficult to improve the quality of the portfolio through staff learning&#13;
because "the goal post is always shifting."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.50    It appears that the primary difficulties managers have in communicating their&#13;
views on how well the FY04 learning program addresses the issue of portfolio quality&#13;
are: (1) how to properly assess the impact of this particular type of training, and (2) lag&#13;
time between learning and quality improvement. For instance, this manager asks,&#13;
&#13;
    "When you improve quality will it show in a year or two? Will it show in the new&#13;
    operations? I mean you can say the quality of the program [is responsible for&#13;
    improvement], but I am not sure if you'd get a reasonable outcome in a year."&#13;
&#13;
2.51    A senior manager explained "that [portfolio quality] tends not to be done in the&#13;
context of learning because it is a very process oriented activity. It tends not to be a&#13;
learning activity except for some Learning Plans the time of HD Week." Her comments&#13;
shed some light on why these managers had such difficulty in determining how well&#13;
aligned the FY04 learning program is addressing the issue of improving the quality of the&#13;
HD portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
Priority Area # 4 - Improving momentum toward achieving the Millennium Development&#13;
Goals (MDG)s.&#13;
&#13;
2.52    Most managers agreed that because MDGs are implicit in all the work the Bank&#13;
does, staff constantly work to achieve the goals set forth in them. In terms of how the&#13;
HDN LP prepares staff to fulfill MDG-stipulated goals, some managers expressed the&#13;
concern that since MDG concepts are so new, staff need more time to internalize them&#13;
before they can actualize them.     According to one manager "people are only now&#13;
beginning to internalize the concepts in the MDGs and mentioning it in their rhetoric."&#13;
Some people, he said, "are now beginning to include them in projects." Overall, most&#13;
managers agreed that MDGs are only nominally included in the FY04 learning program&#13;
and that, since the MDGs are a new area of focus for the HDN work program, apart from&#13;
discussing them at retreats and during the HD Forum 2003, not much emphasis is placed&#13;
on including them in the HDN learning program.&#13;
&#13;
                                        SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
2.53    Overall, managers who attended the focus groups indicated that in order for HD&#13;
staff to work effectively within and outside of the HD Network, the following three key&#13;
HD-specific competencies are pivotal:&#13;
            · Core competencies, both technical and HD-sector specific;&#13;
&#13;
            · Multi-sectoral competencies; and&#13;
            · Operational competencies.&#13;
&#13;
2.54    In addition to these competencies, managers felt that HD staff needs to focus on&#13;
continuous learning. As adult learners, they need to: 1) fully embrace the concept of&#13;
learning, and 2) seek out non-traditional ways of learning. Managers suggested peer&#13;
learning, mentoring and coaching from experienced colleagues and managers, and client&#13;
learning as effective modes of continuous learning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.55    Managers expressed satisfaction with the quality and content of the technical and&#13;
operational learning that HDN currently provides. However, managers felt that staff need&#13;
to keep their technical training, sector specific learning and operational learning&#13;
consistent and current. Despite overall satisfaction with the quality of HD-provided&#13;
technical training, some managers felt that the following aspects of the program could be&#13;
improved:&#13;
            · Focus (integrated or multi-sectoral versus compartmentalized);&#13;
&#13;
            · Content (tailored/demand driven versus generic/supply driven); and&#13;
            · Organization and scheduling.&#13;
&#13;
2.56    Managers considered it important that the HDN learning program continues not&#13;
only to provide staff with technical and HD sector-specific training, but also to integrate&#13;
the learning to include other sectors. Integrated learning would make staff aware of and&#13;
impart substantive input to the work of their colleagues in other sectors within HD. It&#13;
would also prepare staff to work multi-sectorally with Networks outside of HD.&#13;
Managers observed that the HD staff are not yet able to make substantive contributions&#13;
outside of their own sectors, as compared to staff from other Networks such as PREM.&#13;
&#13;
2.57    Managers also stressed that it is crucial for all HDN learning to be tailored to the&#13;
specific needs of staff. All managers strongly suggested that learning should be multi-&#13;
sectorally focused; some suggested that learning not only be customized, but also cutting-&#13;
edge in content. Cutting-edge knowledge is presumed to enhance good practices and&#13;
introduce new lending instruments. It will also raise staff's awareness and influence their&#13;
perception. Overall, managers expect the learning program to provide current, relevant,&#13;
and demand-driven technical, operational and leadership training. Managers agreed that&#13;
demand-driven learning is more relevant to staff needs and more likely to have a greater&#13;
impact on work performance and effectiveness than supply-driven training.&#13;
&#13;
2.58    Managers agreed that the four Priority Areas listed in the FY04 LP are only in&#13;
partial alignment with the HDN work program. Priority Area #1, Integrating HD into&#13;
multi-sectoral and programmatic lending activities and Priority Area #3, Following up on&#13;
the WDR on service delivery met their expectations, while Priority Areas #2, Continuing&#13;
to pay close attention to issues of portfolio quality and #4, Increasing momentum toward&#13;
achieving the MDGs, although present in the LP, are not in complete accordance with&#13;
manager expectations.&#13;

        3. DESK REVIEW OF FY04 LEARNING PLAN AND&#13;
                     LEARNING ACTIVITIES OFFERED&#13;
&#13;
3.1      In the previous chapter, we present the key staff competencies identified by HD&#13;
managers and explored the types of learning staff needs to achieve these objectives. In&#13;
this chapter, we attempt to map these HD staff competencies and learning needs to the&#13;
HDN FY04 LP and to the learning activities offered by HDN in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
3.2      The primary objective of this chapter is to assess how well the HDN FY04 LP is&#13;
aligned with HD staff learning needs. Additionally, we try to determine the strengths and&#13;
weaknesses of the HDN FY04 LP and identify possible learning gaps. Furthermore, this&#13;
chapter explores the supply side of learning as it applies to country office staff, and&#13;
determines how accessible HDN learning program is to staff outside of Headquarter&#13;
(HQ).&#13;
&#13;
                                                  METHODS&#13;
&#13;
3.3      This desk review compares three sources of information: 1) the HD managers'&#13;
listing of key competencies for HD staff and their learning needs; 2) the objectives of the&#13;
HDN FY04 LP, including Priority Areas and Learning Board budget allocation; and 3) a&#13;
list of all HDN learning events in FY04 (203 proposed, 234 actual).4 The learning event&#13;
list was obtained from the Lotus Notes Learning Catalog summary report.&#13;
&#13;
3.4      In order to facilitate the evaluation process, we have identified the type, theme,&#13;
and objectives of each of the 234 events actualized. The events are categorized into one&#13;
or more of the following groups:&#13;
&#13;
             · Sector-specific/Technical;&#13;
             · Operational;&#13;
&#13;
             · Multi-sectoral/Integrating HD into multi-sectoral and programmatic&#13;
                  lending (LP Priority #1);&#13;
&#13;
             · Portfolio quality (LP Priority #2);&#13;
             · Following up on the WDR on service delivery (LP Priority #3); and&#13;
&#13;
             · Improving momentum toward achieving the MDGs (LP Priority #4).&#13;
&#13;
3.5      A good portion of the events covered as many as four of these areas. These&#13;
groups of events, as well as the Priority Areas outlined by the LP, were then compared to&#13;
the staff competencies and learning needs considered most integral by managers. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4This list was extracted from the Lotus Notes Learning Catalog Summary Report in March, 2004. Hence,&#13;
all BBLs falling after this date until the end of FY04 are not included in the course list. We estimate that&#13;
there is one HD BBL per day, which means we may have excluded up to 90 BBLs in the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                           21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
staff competencies and learning needs are outlined in detail in previous chapters and will&#13;
not be repeated here.&#13;
&#13;
3.6    It should be mentioned that the separate sessions comprising the Forum and the&#13;
Learning Week are treated as individual events in this analysis. Failure to recognize this&#13;
approach may lend little weight to the Sector Weeks as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
3.7    This mapping exercise is both subjective and complicated because HDN does not&#13;
normally classify its offerings into separate areas, or groups. The statistics presented in&#13;
the results section should be read as approximations of the alignment between the&#13;

3.8    Table 6 maps the LP and its activities to the staff key competencies and learning&#13;
needs identified by managers. The table addresses the way in which the HDN learning&#13;
budget is allocated, the priorities of the HDN FY04 LP, the number of HDN events and&#13;
the number of event attendees, to the key competencies that managers believed to be of&#13;
topmost importance for HD staff.&#13;

Learning Board budget allocation (Table 6, Column A)&#13;
&#13;
3.9    The Learning Board allocated $2,120,000 to HDN staff learning.           Fifty-three&#13;
percent ($1,125,000) of the Learning Board fund was devoted to sector-specific and&#13;
technical learning and is evenly spread over the three HD sectors (Education, HNP, and&#13;
SP). Another 14 percent ($300,000) was allocated to HD for CDF or multi-sectoral and&#13;
integrative training. Moreover, the HD Forum, accounting for 11 percent ($225,000) of&#13;
the budget, focused on providing services to the poor, which falls under LP Priority Area&#13;
#1.&#13;
&#13;
3.10   Additionally, 14 percent of the budget ($300,000) was allocated to HD&#13;
Operations, an area that managers also mentioned as crucial. Smaller amounts of the&#13;
budget went toward the PDG Program ($100,000, or five percent), the Foundations of&#13;
Team Leadership Module 1 for HD staff ($50,000, or two percent) and toward&#13;
developing a Business and Career Management tool ($20,000 or one percent).&#13;

*Because we were unable to extract information for every HD learning event in FY04, the number of events and participants in this table should not be interpreted as exact and are most likely lower than&#13;
the true numbers. The shares of events and participants in each category, however, are approximations of the true numbers. Moreover, shares of events and participants do not add up to 100 percent&#13;
since each event can be classified under multiple categories and staff can participate in multiple events.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Priority Areas (Table 6, Column B)&#13;
&#13;
3.11    As discussed earlier the four main Priority Areas in the FY04 LP are:&#13;
            · Integrating HD with multi-sectoral and programmatic lending activities&#13;
                (or HD in the CDF context);&#13;
            · Continuing to place close attention to issues of portfolio quality;&#13;
            · Following up on the WDR on service delivery; and&#13;
&#13;
            · Improving momentum toward achieving the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
3.12    HDN is gradually increasing the number and quality of foreign learning&#13;
programs in an effort to reach more country office staff. For instance, HDN doubled its&#13;
PRSP learning efforts and allocated $300,000 of its Learning Board funds to two major&#13;
PRSP workshops--one to take place in East Asia &amp; the Pacific (EAP) and South Asia&#13;
Region (SAR), and one in AFR.&#13;
&#13;
3.13    The LP places great emphasis on team-based learning in four areas: HD in the&#13;
CDF context, Quality Enhancement Reviews (QERs), the Forum, and in a Team Leader&#13;
module geared to HD staff.&#13;
&#13;
3.14    According to the managers interviewed, the Priority Areas stated in the LP are&#13;
partially aligned with the key competencies and learning needs critical to fulfilling&#13;
HDN business objectives. Managers agreed upon the importance of sector-specific and&#13;
technical skills, multi-sectoral and integrative skills, as well as team-building skills, and&#13;
cited them as pivotal to the success of staff training. The mapping results show that the&#13;
LP is well aligned with the HDN work program in terms of all of the aforementioned&#13;
key competencies. On the contrary, managers rarely mentioned LP Priority Areas #2&#13;
and #4 when listing staff needs.        Instead, managers stressed that staff should be&#13;
equipped with behavioral, leadership and communication skills, which fall under the&#13;
aegis of HR rather than the HDN learning program.&#13;
&#13;
3.15    Managers also expressed an immediate need for operational skills training. The&#13;
LP does not meet this demand as effectively for the following two reasons: 1)&#13;
operational learning is a secondary, rather than a priority focus of the HDN learning&#13;
program, and 2) the Team Leadership Module is the only program in which HDN offers&#13;
team-building, behavioral, leadership and communication training. Operations skills&#13;
learning was provided to only 36 staff members and in one team-based action learning&#13;
event in Kenya, which covered an additional five staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Alignment of LP with activities offered in FY04&#13;
&#13;
Number of events-All events (Table 6, Column C)&#13;
&#13;
3.16     The number of events mapped to the key-competencies and learning-need areas&#13;
defined by managers is closely aligned with HDN business objectives. At the time that&#13;
the list of FY04 events was developed, 89 percent of all events were classified as sector-&#13;
specific and technical; 48 percent fell under the multi-sectoral and integrative category;&#13;
and 27 percent fell into the operational events category. Moreover, 38 percent of the&#13;
events are categorized under Priority Area #3 - Following up on the WDR on service&#13;
delivery, which has a multi-sectoral component.&#13;
&#13;
3.17     A smaller number of events are classified under Continuing to place close&#13;
attention on issues of portfolio quality and Improving momentum toward achieving the&#13;
MDGs, but these are not specifically identified as areas in which staff lack skills.&#13;
&#13;
Number of events - Formal events&#13;
&#13;
3.18     Table 7 lists the number of planned HDN learning events in FY04 by event type.&#13;
A large share (41 percent) of the events offered in FY04 are BBLs, which are short in&#13;
duration and usually technical in nature.5 Because BBLs are much different from other&#13;
more formal events, we look at BBLs separately. For the sake of simplicity we have&#13;
labeled all events other than BBLs as formal.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
5Table 6, Column C reports that 84 out of 234, 36 percent, of the HDN events are BBLs but since this list&#13;
suffers from incomplete data, the number of proposed events in Table 7 is more accurate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eighty-eight percent are sector-specific and technical, and 46 percent are classified as&#13;
multi-sectoral (Table 6, Column C, formal). A large share (45 percent), however, is&#13;
classified as operational, which makes sense since operational learning programs&#13;
require an in-depth treatment of the topic at hand and are therefore longer in duration&#13;
than the usual 1.5 hours that a BBL normally lasts. Because operational learning is one&#13;
of the top-most learning needs, the large supply of operational formal events is well&#13;
aligned with learning demand.&#13;
&#13;
Number of events - BBLs&#13;
&#13;
3.20    BBLs are different from formal events in terms of their alliance with staff&#13;
competencies and learning needs. Like formal events, around half of the BBLs (51&#13;
percent) are classified as multi-sectoral, 46 percent covered themes related to WDR and&#13;
service delivery, and 18 percent addressed the fourth Priority Area, Improving&#13;
momentum toward achieving the MDGs, which also falls into the multi-sectoral&#13;
category. However, because technical and cutting-edge learning is more suitable for&#13;
events of short duration, a large share (92 percent) of BBLs are classified as technical&#13;
and a much smaller share (18 percent) are classified as operational in nature. Virtually&#13;
none of the BBLs covered portfolio quality issues, which was not mention as a specific&#13;
learning need by managers.&#13;
&#13;
3.21    All and all, the total number of offerings by the HDN learning program is very&#13;
well aligned with the three most important staff key competencies and learning needs:&#13;
sector-specific and technical, multi-sectoral, and operational.&#13;
&#13;
Share of participants (Table 6, Column D)&#13;
&#13;
3.22    It is important when analyzing the number of learning events not only to&#13;
compare the raw number of activities, but also to keep in mind the size and coverage of&#13;
these activities. Similarly to the allocation of events in each of the areas in which staff&#13;
need specific training, in order to deliver the HDN work program more efficiently, the&#13;
number of staff that are reached by these events is also well aligned with the demand for&#13;
learning.&#13;
&#13;
3.23    It makes no real difference whether one looks at the Formal events separately&#13;
from the BBLs or not.        In both cases, between 80 and 90 percent of staff that&#13;
participated in the 234 learning events attended learning programs on sector-specific&#13;
and technical topics, 40 to 50 percent attended operational training, and around 30 to 40&#13;
percent participated in activities that with multi-sectoral components. Moreover, a large&#13;
share of staff attended learning that falls into the third and fourth LP Priority Areas:&#13;
Following up on the WDR on service delivery and Improving momentum toward&#13;
achieving the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Reaching country office staff&#13;
&#13;
3.24     On the other hand, the FY04 LP emphasizes a need to reach more country office&#13;
staff and to improve the quantity and quality of the events taking place in country&#13;
settings. Of the 234 HDN learning events, only 17 were held outside Washington. Of&#13;
these 17, six were held in other developed countries and 11 were held in developing&#13;
countries. One of the more important events to be held in a country office was the five-&#13;
day PRSP workshop in Africa, but this event included only four African Bank staff.&#13;
The second PRSP workshop, which was scheduled in EAP and SAR, did not take place&#13;
during FY04. Other than the aforementioned events, all HDN learning took place in&#13;
Washington, to which country office staff can travel, but only if time and budget allow.6&#13;
No information on how many country office and HQ staff in total were trained in the&#13;
HDN activities is available.&#13;
&#13;
3.25     It should be mentioned that the bi-annual HD Forum, together with the Learning&#13;
Week (which took place in November, 2003 in Washington), are important events for&#13;
country office staff. The scope and effects of the learning that took place at the Forum,&#13;
especially by country office staff, is discussed in a separate evaluation. In terms of&#13;
increasing the number and quality of learning available to country office staff, the LP is&#13;
not seen to be successful.&#13;
&#13;
                                               SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
3.26     This chapter presents the evaluation results of the alignment of the HDN FY04&#13;
LP with the HD manager assessments and the alignment of the HDN LP with HD staff&#13;
learning needs. In essence, the results show:&#13;
&#13;
Areas where alignment is good&#13;
&#13;
3.27     Generally, the HDN LP and the learning offerings in FY04 seem to be well&#13;
aligned with the key competencies and learning needs that HD managers listed as top-&#13;
most priority. The main knowledge and skills that managers designated of highest need&#13;
are: sector-specific/technical, operational and multi-sectoral/integrative.                           These&#13;
categories are also of top priority to the LP and were addressed in the majority of&#13;
learning events attended by staff.&#13;
&#13;
3.28     The fourth area that managers stated as important to staff learning is team&#13;
building. A great number of team building events take place during the bi-annual&#13;
Forum in the form of informal networking. Team building is the main focus in the&#13;
Foundations of Team Leadership Module. The only weakness of this event is that it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6A number of the HD HQ-based learning events were broadcasted to county office staff through B-Span&#13;
and video-conference links. While these methods increase country office staff's participation in learning,&#13;
not being physically present at the event may lead to less effective learning, as the remo te participants&#13;
miss out on much of the informal learning taking place through networking, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
targets only team leaders, while staff that are not team leaders could just as easily&#13;
benefit from the offerings.&#13;
&#13;
Areas where alignment is poor&#13;
&#13;
3.29    The fifth area of importance to managers regarding staff learning encompasses&#13;
behavioral, communication and leadership skills. As this type of learning usually falls&#13;
under the aegis of HR, the HDN learning program does not focus on these skills.&#13;
Because it is now clear that managers value behavioral skills very highly, the HDN&#13;
learning program may want to incorporate more learning of this type into its LP.&#13;
&#13;
3.30    Finally, the HDN learning program is not well attuned with the needs of country&#13;
office staff. More courses and workshops need to be delivered in country settings and&#13;
staff from country offices should be given increased access to learning without having&#13;
to spend time and money traveling to HQ.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
          4. HD STAFF LEARNING PARTICIPATION: A&#13;
                           DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
4.1     In the previous two chapters, we assessed how well the HDN staff learning&#13;
programs planned reflect HDN business objectives, and whether or not they adequately&#13;
addressed staff needs.      In the next two chapters, we turn our attention to learning&#13;
demand and examine how HD staff utilize the learning program (this chapter), as well&#13;
as the results of learning participation (next chapter). Some of the information derived&#13;
from these two chapters are used to form recommendations that can help HDN improve&#13;
its learning program implementation.&#13;
&#13;
4.2     The purpose of this chapter is to present an overall picture of the HDN staff&#13;
learning program, the level of participation across HD sectors and affiliations, and to&#13;
identify those most likely to attend learning events, as well as the types of events&#13;
attended. The analysis was based on the staff learning data documented in PeopleSoft&#13;
and extracted by HR. In order to supplement our review of the HR learning records, we&#13;
asked HD staff survey respondents about their level of participation in events provided&#13;
by the HD-Hub (HDN). Detailed descriptions of the staff survey and survey methods&#13;
employed are presented in the following chapter.&#13;
&#13;
                                             HR DATA&#13;
&#13;
4.3     The HR data set used for this analysis contains records for all Bank staff&#13;
members listed as of January 31, 2004.               In this study, only information on staff&#13;
identifying HDN as their primary network is used.7 The time period covered is 19&#13;
months, from July, 2002 to January, 2004. Table 8 outlines the data domains and&#13;
variables used for this analysis. The HR staff records are completely confidential, and&#13;
therefore do not contain names and Universal Personnel Identifier (UPI) numbers.&#13;
However, every record contains a unique personal identification code, assigned by HR.&#13;
The identification code is designed and maintained by HR and is not available to IEG.&#13;
&#13;
4.4     It should be noted that in this analysis we focus on staff learning records from&#13;
FY03 because they provide the most recent and complete information available.&#13;
However, comparisons between fiscal years 2002 through 2004 show that the&#13;
demographical distribution is more or less the same in terms of the dates and types of&#13;
learning activities conducted in FY03.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7Hence, although ACS staff are significant contributors to the work performed in HDN, ACS staff are&#13;
primarily mapped to the ACS network and are excluded from the majority of this analysis, which&#13;
concentrates mainly on HD technical staff. ACS staff supporting HD units are treated in a separate&#13;
section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   29&#13;

                                           ANALYSIS FINDINGS&#13;
&#13;
Overall learning participation&#13;
&#13;
4.6     The Bank's staff learning activities/events can be divided into two categories:&#13;
formal learning, such as courses and seminars, and informal learning, such as BBLs and&#13;
clinics. The length of activities ranges from several days for formal courses to one or&#13;
two hours for informal activities, such as BBLs. In order to more completely assess&#13;
staff learning participation, we measured both the number of activities/events attended&#13;
and the duration of the activities/events attended.                  It is important to note that this&#13;
analysis is concerned with the HD staff learning participation as a whole, therefore it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
includes all learning events that staff attended and documented in the HR data set (such&#13;
as professional, operational, Information Technology [IT], language, behavioral)&#13;
offered not only by the HDN learning program, but also by the other SLCs in the Bank,&#13;
and even external suppliers.&#13;
&#13;
4.7     Figure 1 displays the share of staff by level of learning activities in FY03. The&#13;
most notable share, over one fifth of HD staff (or 27 percent of the HD population), did&#13;
not report any learning activities in FY03.                      Approximately 20 percent of the staff&#13;
attended only one activity; one fourth of staff attended two activities; and only 14&#13;
percent of all staff attended more than five activities during FY03.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.8     On average, HD staff (staff who are primarily mapped to the HD Network)&#13;
attended approximately three learning activities per year in FY03-FY04 for a total of&#13;
five to six learning days. Among the staff who attended at least one learning program&#13;
event, the average number of activities attended was between 3.5 and 5 activities over&#13;
5.5 to 7.5 days. The staff with the highest number of activities and days each year&#13;
attended over 20 activities over six weeks each year (Table 10).&#13;

4.9    In addition to staff who are primarily mapped to the HD Network, there are&#13;
many support staff members working in HD units who are primarily mapped to the&#13;
ACS Network.      These ACS staff working in HD units are important to the work&#13;
performed in the HD Network. Unfortunately, the HR data only identify the 39 ACS&#13;
staff working in the HD-Hub.&#13;
&#13;
           · Of the 39 ACS staff accounted for, three did not attend any learning&#13;
               activities in FY03. Figure 2 demonstrates the share of HD-Hub ACS&#13;
               staff by level of activities. Consistent with the data above, a small share&#13;
               of ACS staff (25 percent) attended only one or two activities in FY03,&#13;
               while as many as one third (28 percent) participated in more than five&#13;
               activities.&#13;

           · ACS staff attended on average four to five activities over approximately&#13;
               five days each year during FY03-FY04 (Table 11). In comparison with&#13;
               the HD professional staff, ACS staff participated in one to two more&#13;
               activities each year, but the activities in which ACS staff participated&#13;
               were of shorter length. On average, ACS staff participated in the same&#13;
               number of days of learning as professional staff each year.&#13;

The non-learners: who are they?&#13;
&#13;
4.10    Out of the 548 HD staff included in the analysis data, 150 staff members were&#13;
identified as having zero learning in FY03. Detailed profiles of the non-learners are&#13;
presented in Table A1, in Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
            · The majority (77 percent) of the non-learning staff are senior staff and&#13;
                staff stationed in HQ.&#13;
&#13;
            · Among the sectors, Cross-HD and HNP have the highest share of non-&#13;
                learners compared to the entire HD staff in those sectors with 49 and 68&#13;
                staff respectively who had no learning in FY03, corresponding to 36 and&#13;
                34 percent respectively of the HD staff in the sector (see total HD staff&#13;
                by sector in Table 9). SP and Education had the lowest share of non-&#13;
                learners with 25 staff (19 percent) and 49 staff (25 percent) without any&#13;
                learning in FY03.&#13;
&#13;
            · The regions/Vice Presidential Units (VPUs) with the highest share of&#13;
                non-learners are EAP (41 percent), SAR (38 percent) and WBI (34&#13;
                percent).&#13;
            · For these 150 non-learners in FY03, we looked at the data in FY02 and&#13;
                FY04, which shows that 111 out of 150 staff had learning in FY02, while&#13;
                39 staff had no learning in FY02.       Among the 39 staff without any&#13;
                learning during FY02 and FY03, only nine had no learning in FY04&#13;
                either. Seven of these nine were working in Education, one in HNP, and&#13;
                one in SP. The staff without learning over the three-year period were&#13;
                evenly spread out across the regions.&#13;
&#13;
Learning participation by different demographic groups&#13;
&#13;
4.11    Further analysis of HD staff learning participation was carried out for different&#13;
demographic groups. Among learning participants, three individuals had 36 or more&#13;
learning days in FY03 and/or FY04 and we treated as "outliers" and removed from the&#13;
analysis data. Ultimately, the final analysis was based on 395 valid entries. The exact&#13;
number of learning activities and learning days attended by HD staff across different&#13;
demographic groups are presented in Tables A2 and A3 in Annex 2. The key messages&#13;
and highlights of the analysis are discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
Gender groups&#13;
&#13;
4.12    Female staff attended more learning events than male staff. As shown in Figure&#13;
3, female staff attended more learning activities than did male staff. However, when&#13;
comparing the number of days of learning per staff, men had slightly more learning than&#13;
women. This result suggests that female staff attended a greater number of shorter&#13;
activities than male staff and that male staff attended fewer but longer events.&#13;

&#13;
Age groups&#13;
&#13;
4.13    Level of learning participation declines with age. As depicted in Figure 4, the&#13;
younger the staff, the more learning attended. This relationship holds both for learning&#13;
activities and learning days, but is especially obvious with regard to number of learning&#13;
days, which declines from almost nine days per year for those less than 40 years of age&#13;
to around 5.6 days per year for staff above 50 years of age. One assumption about the&#13;
steep reduction of staff learning participation as staff gets older is that experience&#13;
compensates for learning, i.e. more experienced staff have developed the knowledge&#13;
and skills taught in the learning available through their work.                                             The assumption of&#13;
experience compensation is examined in the next sections. Another explanation could&#13;
be that experienced staff attended the core learning courses in the past and are currently&#13;
attending only cutting-edge learning.&#13;

Years of service in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
4.14                     Level of learning participation declines with years of Bank service. Figure 5&#13;
shows the level of learning by years of experience in the Bank. Experience is divided&#13;
into two groups: those who have been in the Bank for less than five years and those who&#13;
have been in the Bank for five years of more. Figure 5 also shows average learning&#13;
levels for staff divided into narrower sub-groups of experience. As anticipated, more&#13;
experienced staff attend fewer learning events than less experienced staff. 8 This&#13;
difference is especially apparent in learning days per year. Less experienced staff tend&#13;
to attend longer events than more experienced staff. These events are most likely the&#13;
formal learning events that experienced staff may have attended in the past or events&#13;
that are too elementary for greatly experienced staff. Staff that have been in the Bank&#13;
less than two years were the most active learning participants in FY03, with more than&#13;
twice as many days of learning as staff with 15 or more years in the Bank. One way to&#13;
interpret why experienced staff have fewer days of learning than newer staff is that&#13;
experienced staff may have attended mainly technical BBLs, which are shorter in&#13;
duration but more frequent, while newer staff attend Bank Operations learning events,&#13;
which are mainly formal courses. We discuss the different types of learning attended at&#13;
a later stage.&#13;

Grade level&#13;
&#13;
4.15                     Learning participation declines with grade level.          In accordance with our&#13;
observation that older and/or more experienced staff attend fewer learning events than&#13;
younger and/or less experienced staff, Figure 6 demonstrates that lower-grade (GE-GF)&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
staff, attended more learning activities and days than higher-grade (GG-GK) staff. In&#13;
FY03, GE-GF staff attended on average around four activities over nine days while GG-&#13;
GK staff attended only three activities over six days. This difference between the two&#13;
grade groups may be due to the fact that most GE-GF grade level staff are younger and&#13;
less experienced with the Bank than GG-GK grade staff. We further explore the issue&#13;
of learning targeted to upper-level staff in the next chapter.&#13;

4.16    Staff in Headquarters participated in more learning than staff located in country&#13;
offices. As shown in Figure 7, staff in HQ attended at least one more event than staff&#13;
stationed in country offices. However, the discrepancy between the two groups seems&#13;
small. This finding is not surprising since most of the Bank internal learning is offered&#13;
in HQ and time and travel expenses may limit the participation of country office staff.&#13;
&#13;
4.17    In addition, BBLs are almost exclusively offered in HQ and therefore less&#13;
accessible to country office staff. When country office staff do have occasion to attend&#13;
training, they usually participate in the longer, formal events, such as courses, seminars&#13;
and Sector Weeks, which occupy a larger number of days each year.&#13;

4.18   Staff in the Middle East and North Africa (MNA) attended more learning events&#13;
than staff in other regions. Figure 8 shows that HD staff from the MNA region&#13;
participated in, on average, over four activities lasting a total of around eight days in&#13;
FY03, while staff in SAR attended only two activities lasting a total of five days over&#13;
the same period. Although it appears that staff from AFR and EAP attended few&#13;
learning activities, the amount of learning days averaged by both were close to other&#13;
regions. In addition, HD-Hub staff participated in five activities, or at least eight days&#13;
of learning, per year. As we will see in the next chapter, staff learning participation is&#13;
influenced by many factors, such as staff work programs and organizational factors.&#13;
Without data pertaining to these factors in the current study, it is difficult to explain&#13;
why these regional differences exist.&#13;

4.19   Staff from Social Protection (SP) and the Cross-HD attended more learning&#13;
events than staff from other sectors. As displayed in Figure 9, on average, these two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                         37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sectors had one more activity per staff and 1.5 to three days more of learning than staff&#13;
in the Education and HNP sectors. Again, we do not have enough information to&#13;
explain why SP staff have such high instances of learning. As presented in Table A7 in&#13;
Annex 2, SP staff attended a higher number of learning activities than their counterparts&#13;
in the other HD sectors.&#13;

&#13;
Who are the high-intensity learners and low-intensity learners?&#13;
&#13;
4.20    Learning intensity of staff, age group and grade level seem to go hand in hand&#13;
and are strongly correlated. Across all HD staff, age and years in the Bank have a&#13;
correlation coefficient of 0.45. Age and grade level are correlated at 0.54, while years&#13;
at the Bank and grade level are a little less strongly correlated at 0.27. Regression&#13;
analysis shows that all three of these demographic indicators jointly determine the&#13;
number of activities that staff attended in FY03 without any one being dominant as&#13;
driving the result.&#13;
&#13;
4.21    However, when it comes to days of learning in FY03, the number of days that&#13;
staff attended learning events is highly determined by staff experience.               In fact,&#13;
experience is a stronger indicator of staff attendance than both age and grade level. In&#13;
essence, more experienced Bank staff attend significantly fewer days of learning than&#13;
inexperienced staff. Tables A4-A7 in Annex 2 show the number of staff and the&#13;
average level of staff learning across sub-groups defined by the demographic&#13;
characteristics alluded to earlier.&#13;
&#13;
4.22    Because the HDN learning program is organized into and delivered to multiple&#13;
sectors, it is important to consider the level of participation for the different&#13;
demographic groups within each sector. Table 12 depicts the average level of learning&#13;
in each sector across grade levels and working stations. The table shows that:&#13;
&#13;
           · Out of all four sectors, staff in SP attended the most learning events.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             · HQ staff are allotted substantially more learning activities and days than&#13;
                 country office staff across all sectors and grade levels.&#13;
             · HQ staff at GE-GF grade levels attended at least one more activity than&#13;
                 GG-GK staff throughout all sectors. This pattern also applies to country&#13;
                 office staff, although it is hard to draw any solid conclusions for SP and&#13;
                 Cross-HD in country offices given the small number of staff comprising&#13;
                 each.&#13;

Learning participation by different types of learning activities&#13;
&#13;
4.23     To fully understand the extent of staff learning received, it is important to&#13;
highlight the types of learning events that staff attended. Learning events are organized&#13;
by eleven SLCs in the Bank.             With this in mind, we utilized the coding system&#13;
developed in a previous evaluation9 into the following categories10:&#13;
&#13;
             · Bank Operations: These events work to help participants familiarize&#13;
                 themselves with the Bank's operational framework and primary&#13;
                 functions and policies.&#13;
             · Professional and technical (provided mainly by the six SLCs): These&#13;
                 events    provide     staff  with    the    latest cutting-edge        information,&#13;
                 developments and skills relating to particular professional fields and&#13;
                 topics, such as finance, statistics, and education. This category covers&#13;
                 office skills, which includes helping participants to develop efficient and&#13;
                 effective skills in relation to daily office routines and tasks, such as&#13;
                 planning meetings, arranging travel, and writing minutes.&#13;
             · HR learning: These events are conducted for ACS, Leadership and&#13;
                 Organizational Effectiveness (LOE), and Process and Interaction (P&amp;I)&#13;

              · Information and technology (IT)&#13;
&#13;
4.24     It can be seen from Table 13 that HD staff mainly attended professional and&#13;
technical learning and learning related to Bank Operations.                                        On average, HD staff&#13;
attended 42 percent of the professional and technical events offered in FY03 for a total&#13;
of 2.82 days and 22 percent of the Bank Operations events offered for a total of 2.38&#13;
days. Staff also devoted more than 30 percent, or 1.78 days, learning time to HR-&#13;
related events, which incorporate behavioral, communication, and language skills, as&#13;
well as team-building learning. In Chapter 3 we discussed what HD managers believe&#13;
to be the most vital skills and competencies necessary for HD staff productivity, and&#13;
what types of learning the HDN learning program should focus on in order to address&#13;
these learning needs.&#13;

*There may be other events attended by staff that do not fall into any of the above four categories.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              · When looking at the different groups of staff members presented in&#13;
                    Table 14, it is evident that lower grade level staff attend more Bank&#13;
                    Operations learning events, while upper grade level staff are more likely&#13;
                    to attend professional and technical events. Attendance for both lower&#13;
                    and upper grade level staff in the realms of HR and Information&#13;
                    Technology (IT) learning is equal. Again, this is consistent with the&#13;
                    shorter focus of technical-oriented learning events, such as BBLs, and&#13;
                    the longer focus attributed to operational training.&#13;
              · In comparing HQ and country office staff, it is evident that HQ staff are&#13;
                    privy to much more professional and technical and HR learning than&#13;
                    country office staff, while staff located in country offices tend to receive&#13;
                    more learning in Bank Operations than do HQ staff. BBLs comprise a&#13;
                    large portion of the technical learning offered but are almost exclusively&#13;
                    available to HQ staff, which may explain why HQ staff get more&#13;
                    technical learning than country office staff. It is also possible that&#13;
                    country office staff have more opportunities to attend learning offered&#13;
&#13;

                                                            SURVEY&#13;
&#13;
4.25     Of the 316 respondents to the staff survey, 312 answered the question, Did you&#13;
participate in any learning organized by the HD-Hub in FY03? Of those 312, 77&#13;
percent (241 respondents) said that they did participate in HD-Hub organized learning&#13;
in FY03, while 22 percent (71 respondents) reported that they did not.&#13;
&#13;
4.26     Sixty-two percent of the respondents attended one or two HDN learning&#13;
activities for a total of one day or longer. The respondents who reported that they&#13;
participated in HDN learning activities in FY03 were also asked how many activities&#13;
lasted one day or longer and how many activities were shorter than one day. The&#13;
responses are presented in Figure 10.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.27    Thirty-five percent (N = 74) of the respondents reported that they had&#13;
participated in only one HDN activity lasting one day or longer in FY03. Twenty-seven&#13;
percent (N = 58) reported that they participated in two activities lasting one day or&#13;
longer in FY03; twenty-six percent (55) reported that they participated in three, four or&#13;
five activities lasting one day or longer; and only three percent said that they had&#13;
attended six to ten HDN learning activities lasting one day or longer. Almost ten&#13;
percent (N = 21) reported that they did not attend any HDN activities lasting one day or&#13;
longer in FY03. The average number of activities attended lasting one day or longer&#13;
was 5.38.&#13;
&#13;
4.28    The findings in the HR data analysis and the findings in the self-reported survey&#13;
are highly consistent with each other. Although the self-reported level of learning&#13;
intensity (5.38 activities ­ only HDN events) is higher than the HR-reported intensity&#13;
(3.72 activities ­ all events), one must account for incomplete records in the HR data.&#13;
The size of the group of non-learners is similar in both sources of information (22&#13;
percent self-reported compared to 27 percent as reported in the HR data set), as we will&#13;
see in the next section. Both sources of information show that HD staff mainly engaged&#13;
in professional and technical training, such as BBLs, on specific topics.&#13;
&#13;
4.29    Figure 11 shows the same numbers, but for HDN activities lasting less than one&#13;
day. As evidenced by Figure 11, staff typically attended shorter activities. Only nine&#13;
percent (N = 21) of respondents reported having attended only one HDN activity lasting&#13;
less than one day in FY03.         The majority­25 percent (N = 44)­of respondents&#13;
participated in two HDN activities in FY03; thirty-seven percent (N = 68) attended&#13;
three, four or five activities shorter than one day; and as many as 19 percent (N = 33)&#13;
said that they attended six to ten HDN activities lasting less than one day. As with the&#13;
longer activities, nine percent (N =16) did not attend any HDN activities shorter than&#13;
one day in FY03.&#13;

                                        SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
4.30    This chapter presents the results of the analysis of HD staff learning&#13;
participation over the past 19 months (FY03­04). Considering the entirety of the data,&#13;
most analyses performed are based on FY03 staff learning records and on all learning&#13;
events that staff reported.&#13;
&#13;
4.31    The average level of staff learning participation in the HD Network is&#13;
satisfactory. The HR data results reveal that over 70 percent of HD staff participated in&#13;
some learning activities during the study period. Of the 150 HD staff who were inactive&#13;
in learning during FY03, only a small portion did not engage in any learning activities&#13;
at all over the entire two and half years. The majority of the non-active learning staff in&#13;
FY03 was composed of senior staff stationed in HQ. Most HD staff attended between&#13;
three and four learning events lasting around six days.&#13;
&#13;
4.32    According to the survey, the majority of HD staff (excluding non-active learning&#13;
staff) reported that they attended an average of 2.02 HDN activities lasting one day or&#13;
longer in FY03, while the number activities attended lasting less than one day was 3.36&#13;
on average. Compared to the results from the two data sources, these figures are not far&#13;
off considering that the HR learning records are likely incomplete--especially for&#13;
shorter learning activities, such as BBLs.&#13;
&#13;
4.33    Highly experienced and country office staff attended fewer learning events, but&#13;
the type of learning attended by staff is consistent with demands. The influence of&#13;
geographical location and, to a lesser extent, grade level on learning participation is&#13;
substantial. Staff stationed in HQ and GE-GF staff were more likely to be active, high-&#13;
intensity learners. In terms of learning fields engaged in by the HD staff, professional&#13;
and technical topics were the most popular field for HD staff, accounting for more than&#13;
40 percent of total learning, followed by HR related learning. Again, a clear difference&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
is evident between higher level and lower level staff and between HQ and country&#13;
office staff in choosing learning events to attend. Country office staff, less experienced,&#13;
and lower level HD staff engaged in more Bank Operations learning. The choices made&#13;
by the HD staff, on the one hand, reflect the importance of these learning events in&#13;
helping them to conduct the Bank's business at different stages of their Bank&#13;
experience. On the other hand, it may reflect that learning events available are not&#13;
always physically accessible and do not meet the learning needs of all target groups.&#13;
&#13;
4.34    Technical learning for country office staff could be improved by delivering&#13;
cutting-edge BBLs in another form to country office staff. A lack of local learning&#13;
opportunities (supply) or lack of capacity to access centralized/external learning&#13;
opportunities may make it difficult for HD staff stationed outside of HQ to participate in&#13;
more professional and technical learning activities. As mentioned earlier, BBLs are one&#13;
of the most popular professional and technical learning activities for HQ HD staff.&#13;
Each year, more than 200 BBLs are held in HQ, constituting a large share of the HDN&#13;
staff learning program. As BBLs are shorter, often offered during the lunchtime, and&#13;
usually revolve around cutting-edge professional and technical issues, they are a unique&#13;
learning mechanism for HQ staff.&#13;
&#13;
4.35    Senior staff, staff over the age of 50, and staff with a substantial number of years&#13;
of Bank experience are low-intensity learners, especially in terms of their learning days.&#13;
It is understandable that staff who have been with the Bank for a number of years may&#13;
have more highly developed skills than less experienced staff.             Regardless, it is&#13;
necessary for all staff to stay up to date and face new challenges. BBLs are one&#13;
effective way to share new and cutting-edge professional topics with more experienced&#13;
staff, but they are not necessarily the most efficient format for teaching updated Bank&#13;
Operations and new technology.         Most Operations related learning events and IT&#13;
learning events are designed as formal courses that take place in a classroom or&#13;
laboratory setting. As most of these staff members are TTLs and may be relied upon&#13;
heavily to deliver services, they may find it harder to engage in some learning events,&#13;
particularly those with a longer duration. Clearly, determining how best to design a&#13;
learning event that is accessible to higher-level staff both physically and functionally is&#13;
a strategic issue for the HDN learning program. The next chapter will investigate the&#13;
causes behind low intensity learning participation, and assesses the feasibility of HDN&#13;
learning for country office staff.&#13;

          5. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HDN LEARNING&#13;
        PROGRAMS ­ EVIDENCE FROM STAFF SURVEY&#13;
&#13;
5.1      This chapter focuses on the effectiveness, utilization and impact of the learning&#13;
activities offered by the HDN learning program. It also attempts to explain further some&#13;
of the findings presented in the previous chapter. Summarily, this chapter addresses the&#13;
following evaluation questions:&#13;
&#13;
       (1)  What factors influenced HD staff participation in HDN learning?&#13;
&#13;
       (2)  How effective are the HDN staff learning programs?&#13;
&#13;
       (3)  Did participants utilize the knowledge and skills acquired from the HDN staff&#13;
            learning programs?&#13;
&#13;
       (4)  What is the impact of HDN staff learning programs on HD staff and on the&#13;
            HDN business?&#13;
&#13;
5.2      The information source for this chapter is an online HD staff survey carried out&#13;
between March and April, 2004.&#13;
&#13;
                                          METHODS&#13;
&#13;
Survey&#13;
&#13;
5.3      A thirty-five item survey instrument was developed to collect information from&#13;
staff about their level of learning participation, their motivation to engage in learning,&#13;
their level of use of the knowledge and skills learned, and their perceived impact of the&#13;
HDN learning programs. A copy of the survey instrument appears in Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
5.4      The survey was sent via email to all Bank staff, including support staff and&#13;
consultants, working in HD units across the Bank's offices worldwide and was open for a&#13;
total of 21 days (between March 30 and April 19, 2004). Out of the 1,087 staff that&#13;
received the survey, 324 responded. After removing double records, we had 316 valid&#13;
responses equaling an adjusted response rate of 29 percent. In total, 188 HD staff who&#13;
replied to the survey were formally mapped to HD. There are 548 staff mapped to HD in&#13;
total. 11 The response rate for staff formally mapped to HD is hence 34 percent and&#13;
slightly higher than the total response rate (29 percent) since.&#13;
&#13;
5.5      Seventy-three percent of the respondents to the survey are HQ staff, while 27&#13;
percent are stationed in country offices. Around nine percent are analysts, 42 percent are&#13;
sector specialists, and 13 percent are operation specialists. Just below 13 percent are&#13;
ACS staff in grades GA-GD, 32 percent are level GE-GF, 43 percent are GG-GK level&#13;

staff, and nine percent are consultants. As many as 57 percent of the respondents are&#13;
female while 43 percent are male; 31 percent have been in the Bank for less than two&#13;
years and around half report that they have an Individual Learning Plan (ILP).&#13;
&#13;
5.6     The regional/VPU representation is vast: 30 percent are HD-Hub staff, 19 percent&#13;
are in the AFR, six percent are EAP, 17 percent Europe and Central Asia (ECA), nine&#13;
percent Latin America &amp; the Caribbean (LCR), six percent MNA, eight percent SAR, and&#13;
six percent are mapped to WBI. The sectoral representation is also vast. Thirty-eight&#13;
percent (N = 114) staff reported that they are primarily mapped to HNP, 24 percent (N =&#13;
72) reported that they are mapped to Education, 21 percent to SP (N = 63) and 25 percent&#13;
that they are mapped to Cross-HD or HIV/AIDS. Around nine percent stated that they&#13;
are not mapped to the HD network. These staff members are most likely ACS staff and&#13;
consultants.&#13;
&#13;
Analysis&#13;
&#13;
5.7     In addition to providing descriptive explanations of the different components of&#13;
the analysis, we used regression techniques to assess the relationship between learning&#13;
participation and the effectiveness, utilization, and impact of the learning events. We&#13;
evaluated these relationships statistically in a four-step analytical framework, depicted in&#13;
Figure 12.&#13;
&#13;
5.8     The framework we used was designed under the assumption that the level of&#13;
participation is determined by a bundle of exogenous demographic characteristics (Stage&#13;
1 in Figure 12).     For example, we assume that staff with ILPs are more likely to&#13;
participate in learning events than staff without ILPs.        Also, because staff that are&#13;
stationed at HQ have better access to learning events than staff stationed in country&#13;
offices, we presume that these HQ staff may participate more frequently than country&#13;
office staff. Furthermore, we presume that job category, grade level and experience may&#13;
affect the levels of participation, but we do not make any predetermined expectations&#13;
regarding utilization and impact.&#13;
&#13;
5.9     Secondly, for those staff who attended learning in FY03 (level of participation&#13;
from stage 1&gt;0) perceived effectiveness/usefulness of the learning is determined by the&#13;
level of participation and the bundle of demographics (Stage 2). We hypothesize that&#13;
perceived effectiveness/usefulness of learning events increases with the level of&#13;
participation in HDN learning.&#13;
&#13;
5.10    Thirdly, we assume that the degree to which participants utilize the knowledge&#13;
and skills taught in the learning events depends on how effective/useful staff rated the&#13;
learning, the influence of the bundle of demographic factors, and any possible&#13;
facilitators/barriers (Stage 3). However, we believe that the level of participation may&#13;
not affect utilization since, even if participation is very low (e.g. one activity per year),&#13;
participants can still exercise the learning obtained.&#13;

                                                                                                  47&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.11    In the fourth stage of this analysis, we measure the impact of learning events&#13;
under the presumption that impact is influenced by demographic characteristics, how&#13;
effective/useful the event(s) were rated, and the level of staff participation.     In this&#13;
analysis we define impact as the changes in perception, understanding, behavior and&#13;
productivity relating to HD business that result from attending the learning. In addition,&#13;
in order for impact to take place, participants have to utilize the knowledge and skills&#13;
acquired.   We presume that the higher-intensity learning HDN learning events have&#13;
greater overall impact.&#13;
&#13;
                           PARTICIPATION IN HDN LEARNING&#13;
&#13;
5.12    In the previous chapter, we have presented the results of HD staff participation in&#13;
HDN learning programs with information regarding their overall learning experience in&#13;
FY03. We noted that there are variations in levels of participation across different&#13;
demographic groups. In this section, we utilize the survey information to deduce which&#13;
factors motivate and influence staff learning participation.&#13;
&#13;
Motivation for participation&#13;
&#13;
5.13    Professional interest and growth is the main reason that staff members attend&#13;
learning. We asked staff what the main motivating factors were for their attendance at&#13;
HDN learning. Figure 13 presents the results of this question. The most frequently&#13;
mentioned motivating factor is "For professional interest and growth" (N = 196, or 62&#13;
percent). Forty-four percent (N = 139) of staff cited improving work performance, 42&#13;
percent (N = 133) cited acquiring new and improving existing knowledge and skills, and&#13;
39 percent (N = 123) stated that their main reason for attending staff learning was to&#13;
improve their awareness of new ideas and perspectives. Almost no one (ten staff, or&#13;
three percent) claimed to attend learning because it was mandatory.&#13;
&#13;
5.14    Only half of the HD learning participants have completed an ILP, although the&#13;
majority believe ILPs are useful.       Fifty-two percent (N = 124) of the staff that&#13;
participated in HDN learning in FY03 said that they had an ILP in FY03. Of these 52&#13;
percent, 80 percent (N = 98) believe it is useful to complete an ILP as part of the Overall&#13;
Performance Evaluation (OPE) process.&#13;

5.15               The respondents who reported that they did not participate in any HDN learning&#13;
in FY03 were asked to explain why.12 Figure 14 presents the reasons given by the survey&#13;
respondents.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.16               The main reasons that staff did not participate in HDN learning were heavy work&#13;
schedules and lack of proximity to the learning event. Clearly, the most prevalent reason&#13;
for lack of attendance is heavy workloads. This reason was reported by 38 percent (N =&#13;
27). Twenty percent stated that low traveling budgets were a barrier to attendance (most&#13;
learning events are held at HQ), and another seven percent (N = 5) said that being&#13;
stationed in a field office prevented them from attending. Around 14 percent of the&#13;
respondents (N = 10) explained that they were not informed well enough in advance&#13;
about the learning activities available. A smaller portion (ten percent) said that they were&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
either uninterested in attending HDN learning events or that their manager/supervisor did&#13;
not give them approval.&#13;
&#13;
What determines learning participation?&#13;
&#13;
5.17     In addition to directly asking respondents why they did or did not attend learning&#13;
events, a regression analysis was conducted to assess the main determinants of&#13;
participation intensity. Two Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analyses were&#13;
performed to test the hypotheses specified in the analytical framework (Figure 12, Stage&#13;
1): one regressing the level of learning participation in HDN learning events one day or&#13;
longer (0-10 activities) on respondents' demographic characteristics, the other making&#13;
use of the level of attendance in HDN learning activities shorter than one day (0-10&#13;
activities). The results of the regression analyses are presented in Table 15.&#13;

         ** Statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.18     In contrast to our initial hypotheses, none of the independent variables used in the&#13;
regression analysis on participation in events one day or longer (Table 15, Column 2)&#13;
have any significant effect on the level of participation. The R-square of the regression is&#13;
only 0.061 and the t-statistics (presented in parenthesis) never exceed 1.96, the 0.05 two-&#13;
tailed critical value for an estimation of this sample size.13 Because regression analysis&#13;
of the available data does not explain what drives the level of participation in one day or&#13;
longer HDN learning activities, we will instead compare the distribution of high-&#13;
frequency respondents' characteristics to non-learners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13We do not consider the variables significant at the 0.10 level as determinants since their statistical&#13;
significance is below the generally accepted level of 0.05. The relationship between these independent&#13;
variables and their dependent variables is too weak to draw any major conclusions, and will be treated as&#13;
insignificant in all analyses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.19    Being stationed at HQ is the sole determinant of staff participation in shorter&#13;
HDN learning activities. Turning to activities lasting less than one day (Column 3), we&#13;
see that the only statistically significant variable explaining the level of participation in&#13;
short HDN learning events is being stationed at HQ (ß = 1.260, t = 2.60). Being a HQ&#13;
staff member, as compared to a country office staff member, increases learning&#13;
participation by a little more than one activity on average.&#13;
&#13;
5.20    These results confirm the findings from the analysis of HR's staff learning records&#13;
in the previous chapter. The majority of short HDN learning activities are technical&#13;
BBLs that are held at HQ. Hence, the BBLs are inaccessible for country office staff.&#13;
&#13;
The high-intensity learners compared to the non-learners: who are they?&#13;
&#13;
5.21    The results from the regression analysis can be clarified by comparing the&#13;
learning patterns and demographic characteristics of high-intensity learners to those of&#13;
staff who did not attend any HDN learning in FY03. In this exercise we refer to those&#13;
who attended four or more learning activities lasting one day or longer in FY03 as high-&#13;
frequency learners (14 percent of respondents). When we use the term non-learners, we&#13;
mean those respondents who did not attend any HDN learning activities at all. The&#13;
reason why we compare the two extremes is that we are most likely to detect systematic&#13;
demographic differences in these groups. Had we compared groups more similar in&#13;
nature, the detectors would have been random at best. Table 16 highlights the most&#13;
relevant differences in the learning and demographic characteristics between high-&#13;
intensity learners and non-learners.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
5.22     Table 16 reveals that there are a few demographic characteristics that separate&#13;
high-intensity learners from non-learners. In the high-intensity learning group we find a&#13;
larger share of HQ staff, analysts, sector specialists and grade level GE-GF staff. The&#13;
non-learners are mostly comprised of operational staff, ACS staff, and consultants.&#13;
These results make sense since ACS staff and consultants are less likely to attend HD&#13;
learning than other HD professional staff as they are not officially mapped to the HD&#13;
Network. The amount of upper-level staff (grade GG+) and staff with less than two years&#13;
of experience in both groups is nearly equal.&#13;
&#13;
5.23     Staff in grades GE-GF stationed at HQ are higher-intensity learners than non-&#13;
learners. These results are consistent with the results in the descriptive analysis of the&#13;
level of staff learning for HD staff. HQ staff have more access to learning than country&#13;
office staff, and new staff in lower professional grade levels tend to participate in more&#13;
operational training, which is longer in duration than technical training.&#13;
&#13;
      QUALITY, EFFECTIVENESS AND USEFULNESSOF HDN LEARNING PROGRAMS&#13;
&#13;
Quality&#13;
&#13;
5.24     Staff were also asked to comment on the quality, effectiveness/usefulness and&#13;
impact of the HDN learning program. Figure 15 shows how the respondents rated the&#13;
overall quality of the program. The quality of HDN learning was rated high at 3.92, with&#13;
one being the lowest rating and five being the highest. An overwhelming majority, 79&#13;
percent (N = 192) thought that the quality was "Good" or "Very good". This finding may&#13;
imply that the perceived overall quality of the HDN learning program is high.14&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14As there is no established benchmark for the quality of staff learning programs in the Bank, the level of&#13;
quality of HDN learning is subject to the interpretation of the HD Network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
52&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
5.25     Respondents also provided their opinions on the HDN learning activities with&#13;
respect to a) how they contribute to their own learning and development; and b) how they&#13;
contribute to improving momentum toward HDN business objectives.                                                                The first&#13;
component measures the effectiveness or usefulness of the learning events (we refer to&#13;
this component as effectiveness from here on out). The second component measures the&#13;
impact of the HDN learning program and will be discussed separately.15 Figure 16 shows&#13;
the respondents' views of the effectiveness of HDN learning programs in relation to their&#13;
own learning.&#13;
&#13;
5.26     On average, the effectiveness of learning events was rated above the mid-point.&#13;
The highest-rated learning aspect was "Providing opportunities for networking and&#13;
knowledge sharing" at 4.05, with one being the lowest rating and five being the highest.&#13;
The relevance of learning activities to staff needs was given a rating of 3.94. This finding&#13;
suggests that HDN learning is indeed conducive to networking and relevant to staff's&#13;
work.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
5.27     The lowest rated learning aspect was "Helping you know the resources to call on&#13;
to do things differently" (mean = 3.40). However, because this aspect rated above the&#13;
mid-point, it is clear that respondents do believe that learning activities provide them with&#13;
reasonable resources to call upon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15Although factor analysis of the 12 quality, effectiveness and impact measures show that they are all&#13;
relatively positively correlated, we have divided them in these two groups: a) effectiveness/usefulness ­&#13;
which relates to the quality, effectiveness and usefulness in relation to the learning events, and b) impact ­&#13;
which relates to collective learning, or work that is ongoing in the HD network, and is based upon the&#13;
theoretical underpinnings of the respondents' own learning needs, and is compared to both the collective&#13;
objectives of the entire network and the 12 measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                     53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
What determines effectiveness/usefulness?&#13;
&#13;
5.28     We employed regression analysis to test the hypotheses specified in the analytical&#13;
framework regarding factors that influence perception of effectiveness of HDN learning&#13;
(Figure 12, Step 2).          The same effectiveness categories are used in the regression&#13;
analysis. We constructed an aggregate measure of effectiveness using an un-weighted&#13;
mean of the six measures comprising effectiveness/usefulness. Table 17 shows the&#13;
results of the OLS regression on effectiveness.16&#13;
&#13;
5.29     Contrary to our initial hypotheses, learning effectiveness cannot be determined by&#13;
the intensity of participation, as evidenced in Table 17. Grade levels and ILPs are the&#13;
most notable indicators. Being in grade level GE-GF decreases perceived effectiveness&#13;
by almost 0.4 units, or 11 percent on the average (ß = -0.396, t = -1.97), which is&#13;
interesting since GE-GF level staff are participate the most intensively in learning.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16Even though effectiveness is evaluated on a scale from one to five, we use OLS estimations since the&#13;
average is a continuum between one and five. We choose to include participation only in events lasting one&#13;
day or longer since the impact and effects of these events tend to be stronger than for events shorter than&#13;
one day. Because participation in events longer than one day is exogenous and cannot be explained by any&#13;
of the demographic variables set forth in Table 17, we can safely include these variables and the&#13;
participation variable without risking biased effects due to correlation in the errors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
54&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.30    On the other hand, the explanatory power of the aforementioned estimation is&#13;
very low, and most of the variations in effectiveness/usefulness remain a mystery.&#13;
Unobservable factors (i.e., factor that are not available to the evaluators and are thus&#13;
excluded from these regressions) explain over 90 percent of the variations.&#13;
&#13;
Effectiveness of delivery modes&#13;
&#13;
5.31    PDG is the most effective learning delivery mode. Respondents rated the PDG as&#13;
the most effective of all HDN learning delivery modes (mean rating = 4.37 on a scale of&#13;
one to five) according to Figure 17. Classroom sessions, conferences, team learning and&#13;
informal learning such as Brown Bag Lunches were rated as equally effective. Their&#13;
average ratings range from 3.63 to 3.97, which is above the mid-point but nonetheless not&#13;
very high. The least effective delivery modes according to the respondents were E-&#13;
Learning (mean = 2.86) and B-Span (mean = 2.91), which rated below the mid-point.&#13;

5.32    Staff are not sufficiently aware of the PDG program or have too little time to&#13;
apply and/or attend. Out of the thirty-five survey respondents who applied to the PDG&#13;
program, 31 were approved. The rest of the respondents to the PDG program questions&#13;
reported that they had not (yet) applied to the program. Their reasons are varied and are&#13;
reflected in Figure 18.&#13;
&#13;
5.33    Thirty-one percent (N = 97) of the total respondents claimed lack of awareness of&#13;
the PDG program as the main reason for not applying. Among those who were aware of&#13;
the program, 34 percent (N = 109) stated that lack of time was the main reason they had&#13;
not applied yet. Nine percent reported various deterrents (e.g. recently employed, close&#13;
to retirement, consultants, HD as secondary network). Ten staff members stated that they&#13;
are planning to or are interested in applying, and only four staff did not feel the necessity&#13;
for this type of learning.&#13;

Utilization of knowledge and skills&#13;
&#13;
5.34    Earlier, we presented participants' views on the quality and effectiveness of HDN&#13;
learning activities. However, whether or not participants exercise new knowledge upon&#13;
returning to their offices remained in question. As such, we have divided this analysis&#13;
into two categories: a) knowledge and concepts and b) skills and techniques.&#13;
&#13;
5.35    Though the knowledge and concepts acquired from HDN learning activities is&#13;
relatively high, respondents reported that they make more use of knowledge and concepts&#13;
acquired in the learning events than specific skills and techniques (Figure 19). The&#13;
average use of knowledge and concepts is 3.78, with one being the lowest and five being&#13;
the highest, while the average utilization of skills and techniques is lower at 3.49.&#13;

5.36    Figure 19 shows that the topic of the learning activity has to be relevant to the&#13;
participant's work in order for it to be applied in the work place. The level of use of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
56&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
knowledge and skills acquired in the learning events depends not only upon how much&#13;
the participants absorbed, but also upon the facilitators (enabling factors) of and barriers&#13;
to utilization in the workplace. We asked staff to comment on enabling factors. As&#13;
demonstrated in Figure 20, manager and peer support were rated as the most important&#13;
facilitators, while time, resources, and incentives were rated around the mid-point and&#13;
classified as neither facilitators of nor barriers to the application of the material acquired&#13;
in HDN learning events.&#13;

5.37    Respondents' ratings of factors that act as barriers to the utilization of knowledge&#13;
and skills are shown in Figure 21. It can be seen that lack of time, resources and&#13;
incentives are the most prevalent hindrances. Respondents did not feel that level of&#13;
applicability of the topic or the event, conflicts with existing practices, irrelevance to&#13;
work, and lack of manager and peer support were barriers to utilization. None of these&#13;
factors rated above the mid-point (mean = 3) on the barrier scale.&#13;

What determines level of utilization of knowledge and skills?&#13;
&#13;
5.38        We also used regression analysis to determine the factors that influence utilization&#13;
of knowledge and skills acquired in HDN learning (Step 3). Table 18 shows the results&#13;
of two OLS regression analyses, one pertaining to knowledge and concepts (K&amp;C)&#13;
(Column 2) and one pertaining to skills and techniques (S&amp;T) (Column 3), with respect&#13;
to respondents' perception of the various effectiveness measures, their demographic&#13;
characteristics, and the most important facilitators of and barriers to utilization in the&#13;
work place.17 Relevance to work has a dual role as both an effectiveness measure and a&#13;
facilitator of utilization, as identified in the previous section.&#13;

&#13;
5.39        Consistent with our initial hypotheses, the quality and effectiveness of the&#13;
learning events drives utilization. The coefficients on quality of learning (ßK&amp;C = 0.262, t&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17Although effectivenes s can be determined by a few of the demographic variables, the relationship of the&#13;
demographics and the level of effectiveness is low (R2 effectiveness regression 0.08). Hence, we can&#13;
include both the effectiveness measures and the demographic information simultaneously in the utilization&#13;
equation without risk of correlation in the errors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
= 2.35) (ßS&amp;T = 0.322, t = 2.53) and learning providing new knowledge and skills (ßK&amp;C =&#13;
0.133, t = 1.84) (ßS&amp;T = 0.200, t = 2.43) are the two variables that are most statistically&#13;
significant in both regressions. Even though new knowledge and skills were rated second&#13;
lowest with an average of 3.59, they still seem to be very important to utilization.&#13;
&#13;
5.40     On average, raising perceived quality18 by one unit increases utilization of&#13;
knowledge and concepts by around one fourth of a unit, or seven percent, and raises&#13;
utilization of skills and techniques by one third of a unit or nine percent. If staff were to&#13;
increase their ratings of the extent to which the learning teaches new knowledge and&#13;
skills by one unit, utilization of knowledge and concepts would then go up by three&#13;
percent, while utilization of skills and techniques would increase by six percent.&#13;
&#13;
5.41     In addition, the results show that HQ staff use knowledge and concepts acquired&#13;
in learning events less than others staff. No other demographic characteristics or barriers&#13;
are found to have statistically significant effects on the level of knowledge and skills&#13;
utilization.&#13;
&#13;
Impact and benefits of HDN learning&#13;
&#13;
5.42     Staff generally believe that HDN learning is effective (all six areas were rated&#13;
above the mid-point) in terms of raising awareness and improving work productivity.&#13;
Given that HDN learning adequately supplies staff with the required skills, what&#13;
conclusions can be drawn regarding impact? The five categories of impact and their&#13;
ratings are depicted in Figure 22. It should be noted that these five categories do not&#13;
match exactly the objectives of the HD Network.                                           Rather, they reflect the learning&#13;
objectives of the entire Network. Hence, the ratings presented in Figure 22 should be&#13;
interpreted as approximations.&#13;

integrate HD into multi-sectoral lending activities. The ratings regarding the impact of&#13;
learning events on HDN business objectives are comparable to the effectiveness ratings&#13;
regarding staff's own learning. Figure 22 shows that respondents felt learning events&#13;
raise their awareness of emerging issues (mean = 3.85). However, none of the other&#13;
impact aspects were rated very highly. It is surprising that the area respondents believe to&#13;
be the least helpful is the one listed by the HDN FY04 LP as the first of the four key&#13;
Priority Areas - "Integrating HD into multi-sectoral and programmatic lending". This&#13;
aspect was rated just above the mid-point (mean = 3.16) on the impact rating scale.&#13;
&#13;
What determines learning impact?&#13;
&#13;
5.44    Using again the same analytic framework, we attempt to determine what&#13;
influences the level of impact HDN learning activities have on HDN business objectives.&#13;
As specified in Figure 12 (Step 4) we view impact as mainly a function of staff&#13;
perception of program effectiveness and level of utilization. Table 13 displays the results&#13;
of the OLS regression on impact.&#13;

5.45    The main factors that influence impact are the extent to which the learning&#13;
teaches new and/or improved knowledge and skills. As initially presumed, the level of&#13;
perceived effectiveness has a positive effect on impact. Specifically, Table 19 shows that&#13;
rating the extent to which the learning provides new knowledge and skills by one unit&#13;
higher than the average increases respondents' rating of impact relative to HDN business&#13;
objectives with one third of a unit or nine percent (ß = 0.305, t = 5.99). For existing&#13;
knowledge and skills the same increase would result in a smaller, 0.16 unit increase in&#13;
impact, equaling and increase of five percent (ß = 0.165, t = 2.25). These results are&#13;
noticeable since providing new and improving existing knowledge and skills were rated&#13;
among the lowest of effectiveness aspects. On the contrary, although respondents report&#13;
that the activities they attend are highly relevant to their work and provide many&#13;
networking opportunities, these areas are not important in terms of impact&#13;
&#13;
5.46    Although the results in Table 19 show that there is no evidence that utilization is&#13;
related to impact, utilization is still perceived as the transmission mechanism that&#13;
influences effectiveness to impact.           In addition, once we remove the effectiveness&#13;
measures from the regression in utilization19, knowledge and concepts have a particularly&#13;
strong and significant effect upon impact.&#13;
&#13;
      STAFF'S SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTOF HDN LEARNING PROGRAMS&#13;
&#13;
5.47    The survey asked staff to list up to three topics or learning activities that they&#13;
wish the HDN learning programs will offer in the future. Respondents listed a wide array&#13;
of topics, mainly according to their own work area and interests. The most prevalent&#13;
topics are related to technical skills and, to some extent, integrative and multi-sectoral&#13;
issues. Nearly absent from the "wish-list" is non-HD behavioral types of learning. It&#13;
seems that either staff believe there little need for such skills, or that HDN is not an&#13;
appropriate supplier of this type of learning event.&#13;
&#13;
5.48    Survey respondents also provided opinions and suggestions for the HDN learning&#13;
programs in general. The most commonly cited suggestions were that program planners&#13;
ensure that learning is demand driven and more accessible to country office staff. In&#13;
addition, staff expected more interactive learning, or time for discussions that would&#13;
allow participants to share their experiences. They also felt strongly about including&#13;
clients in the learning events. In fact, learning events attended jointly by staff and clients&#13;
were highly rated, both in terms of usefulness and effectiveness. Both measures were&#13;
rated around four on a 5-point scale, with five representing the most effective.&#13;
Furthermore, several staff said they need more HDN learning targeting ACS staff as&#13;
opposed to only upper-level staff, and that HDN learning needs to be made more&#13;
operational.&#13;
&#13;
                                              SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
5.49    The findings from the survey complement the findings from Chapter V, which&#13;
prove that country office staff, staff in upper, professional-grade levels (as compared to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19ß = 0.377, t = 5.24, R2 = 0.298, N = 183. The effects of the other regressors remain the same.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   61&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the lower professional-grade levels GE-GF), and older and more experienced staff attend&#13;
fewer learning events than HQ staff and staff in lower professional grade levels with less&#13;
experience. The analysis identifies the main motivating factors behind attending HDN&#13;
learning events as staff interest in professional development and growth and improved&#13;
work performance, which are important incentives for young and new staff who want to&#13;
advance their career. Upper-level staff (GG+) with significant experience may not find&#13;
that staff learning is a useful resource for career management, or perhaps they are not&#13;
looking for career development as intensively as younger and less experienced staff in the&#13;
early or middle stages of their professional career.&#13;
&#13;
5.50    Staff also identified lack of time, money and other resources as the main reasons&#13;
why they did not participate more in HDN learning. This is especially evident for&#13;
country office staff who have very limited opportunities to attend learning events held at&#13;
HQ, particularly BBLs. The complete inaccessibility of BBLs to country office staff is of&#13;
great concern since these events are one of the major channels for professional and&#13;
technical and cutting-edge learning and knowledge sharing.&#13;
&#13;
5.51    Perceived quality and effectiveness of HDN learning activities is relatively high,&#13;
especially in the areas of providing opportunities for networking and knowledge sharing,&#13;
relevance to work, and the overall quality of the events. The areas in which learning&#13;
activities were rated the lowest are teaching new knowledge and skills, although these&#13;
aspects were still rated above the midpoint.&#13;
&#13;
5.52    The PDG program was rated the most effective mode of delivery of HDN learning&#13;
program, while distance learning such as B-Span and E-Learning, are perceived as&#13;
relatively poor modes of delivery. In order for the PDG program to increase its coverage&#13;
to include more staff, candidates need to be better informed about the program and its&#13;
requirements, since a large part of the respondents reported that main reason they had not&#13;
applied for the grant was that they were not aware of it.&#13;
&#13;
5.53    Furthermore, respondents reported that although they utilized general knowledge&#13;
and concepts acquired in HDN learning, the utilization of more specific tools like skills&#13;
and techniques only was rated slightly above the mid-point. The factors that facilitate use&#13;
are relevance to work schemes and support from managers and peers, while lack of time,&#13;
money and staff resources and incentives are the main barriers to HDN learning&#13;
participation rather than lack of interest or manager support.&#13;
&#13;
5.54    The impact of HDN learning events is almost exclusively related to awareness&#13;
raising and understanding HDN business objectives, rather than to tangibly affecting the&#13;
goals of the network themselves. Events that teach new and improve existing knowledge&#13;
and skills are the ones where impact is the highest, although the impact of attending HDN&#13;
learning is not as pronounced in terms of integrating HD into multi-sectoral and&#13;
programmatic lending activities--the number one priority of the HDN FY04 LP.&#13;
&#13;
5.55    Based on the regression analysis results, Figure 23 is representative of the actual&#13;
relationship between and determinants of participation, effectiveness, utilization and&#13;
impact of HDN learning. Figure 23 replicates Figure 12, though relationships that could&#13;

                         · Helping integrate HD into multi-sectoral lending&#13;
                         · Enhancing your own productivity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.56   What is evident from the big picture is that there is no statistically significant&#13;
relationship between level of participation and perceived effectiveness, utilization or&#13;
impact. Consequently, it is possible that even very low levels of learning participation&#13;
can be effective and have impacts. Of more significance is the effectiveness of the&#13;
learning.&#13;
&#13;
5.57   The results show that perceived effectiveness best accounts for utilization and&#13;
impact. Specifically, learning activities of high quality and those that teach new or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  63&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
improve existing knowledge and skills increase utilization the most. Moreover, these&#13;
three measures of effectiveness also have independent effects on impact. The influence&#13;
of the demographic characteristics of participants on effectiveness, utilization and impact&#13;
is weak.&#13;

         6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
6.1     This report presents the results of a review of the HDN learning program. The&#13;
overarching evaluation question is whether the HDN learning program is doing the right&#13;
thing, in terms of the level of alignment with the objectives of the HD Network and&#13;
fulfillment of HD staff learning needs.&#13;
&#13;
6.2     Four evaluation activities were carried out during the evaluation phase to address&#13;
various sub-evaluation questions.&#13;
&#13;
                                      CONCLUSIONS&#13;
&#13;
6.3     The primary conclusions of this evaluation are that the HDN learning program&#13;
largely meets HD staff learning needs and has produced some positive impact. However,&#13;
the program is not closely aligned with HDN business objectives. The impact can be&#13;
greater if the HDN learning program were designed in a more demand-driven fashion and&#13;
if it were to provide cutting-edge technical training and make additional efforts to reach&#13;
older, more experienced specialists and country office staff.       These conclusions are&#13;
supported by the following key findings:&#13;
&#13;
HDN learning programs have adequately addressed staff learning needs and&#13;
improved staff competencies.&#13;
&#13;
6.4     According to HD managers, in order for HD staff to work effectively within and&#13;
outside of the HD, they need three key HD-specific competencies and three general non-&#13;
sector related competencies. These are:&#13;
            · Sector-specific;&#13;
&#13;
            · Multi-sectoral competencies;&#13;
            · Operational;&#13;
&#13;
            · Team building;&#13;
            · General leadership; and&#13;
&#13;
            · Behavioral.&#13;
&#13;
6.5     Managers believe that multi-sectoral and operational training, and team building&#13;
and leadership learning are of great need.&#13;
&#13;
6.6     Managers expressed satisfaction with the quality and content of HDN learning&#13;
programs in addressing staff technical and operational competencies.              However,&#13;
managers felt that staff need to continue to update their technical training, sector-specific&#13;
training, and operational training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          65&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.7     The proven alignment of the LP and learning offered by the Network with what&#13;
managers believe to be the most important areas for the HDN learning program to focus&#13;
on supports the finding that the HDN learning program is addressing staff learning needs&#13;
sufficiently.&#13;
&#13;
6.8     However, both the manager focus groups and the desk review suggest several&#13;
areas need improvement to ensure that all staff are equally included in the learning&#13;
agenda. For example, the current learning program could incorporate into its design&#13;
activities country office staff, adult learning and multi-sectoral learning.           Also,&#13;
incorporating HR related learning into traditional HD specific learning events would&#13;
improve team learning, communication, and cooperation within HD and would likely&#13;
enhance the applicabilityof the HD specific learning.&#13;
&#13;
HDN learning programs are partially aligned with the HDN business objectives.&#13;
&#13;
6.9     According to the managers, all of the Priority Areas listed in the HDN FY04 LP&#13;
are aligned with the HDN work program in some way or another. However, of the four&#13;
Priority Areas established, most managers felt alignment was strongest between Priority&#13;
Areas #1 and #3 (Integrating HD into multi-sectoral and programmatic lending activities&#13;
and Following up on the WDR on service delivery) and their work plans. A large share of&#13;
the managers did not consider Priority Areas #2 and #4 (Continuing to pay close attention&#13;
to issues of portfolio quality and Improving momentum toward achieving the MDGs) to&#13;
be closely aligned with their work program. To most managers, these two issues are&#13;
ongoing concepts, not concrete activities; thus it is difficult to determine their alignment&#13;
with the work program.&#13;
&#13;
Most HD staff adequately utilized the learning opportunities available to them.&#13;
&#13;
6.10    The analysis of HR data reveals that over 70 percent of HD staff participated in&#13;
some learning during the study period. On average, most HD staff attended between&#13;
three and four learning events lasting around six days. In line with the competencies that&#13;
HD managers believe that their staff need, professional and technical learning is the&#13;
dominating type of learning attended by HD staff, accounting for more than 40 percent of&#13;
total learning. Of the 150 HD staff who were inactive in learning during FY03, only a&#13;
small portion of staff did not engage in any learning in the entire two and half years&#13;
covered by the study. The majority of non-active learning staff in FY03 are senior staff&#13;
stationed at HQ. Moreover, the analysis identifies that HQ staff attended more learning&#13;
activities than staff in country offices, and older staff, staff with more years of Bank&#13;
service, and staff higher grade levels participated in very few learning events.&#13;
&#13;
6.11    The staff survey denotes lack of time, money and other resources as the main&#13;
reasons for low-intensity participation in HDN learning events. This is especially evident&#13;
for country office staff, who have very limited opportunities to attend learning events at&#13;
HQ, particularly BBLs. The complete inaccessibility of BBLs to country office staff is of&#13;
great concern since these events are an important channel for professional, technical and&#13;
cutting-edge learning and knowledge sharing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
66&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The level of perceived effectiveness, utilization, and impact of HDN programs is&#13;
relatively high.&#13;
&#13;
Perceived quality and effectiveness of HDN learning activities is relatively high&#13;
&#13;
6.12    Staff gave "Providing opportunities for networking and knowledge sharing" the&#13;
highest rating of all the event aspects at 4.05 on a scale of one to five, with five&#13;
representing the most desirable learning event aspect. The lowest-rated learning aspect&#13;
was "Helping you know the resources to call on to do things differently".&#13;
&#13;
PDG was considered as the most effective learning delivery mode&#13;
&#13;
6.13    Staff rated the Professional Development Grant Program (PDG) as the most&#13;
effective of all HDN learning program delivery modes (mean = 4.37 on a scale of one to&#13;
five). Classroom sessions, conferences, team learning and informal learning such as&#13;
brown-bag lunches were rated as equally effective, at ratings ranging from 3.63 to 3.97.&#13;
The least-effective delivery modes according to the respondents were E-Learning (mean&#13;
= 2.86) and B-Span (mean = 2.91), which rated below the mid-point.&#13;
&#13;
Use of knowledge and concepts acquired in the HDN learning activities is relatively high&#13;
&#13;
6.14    The reported average use of knowledge and concepts is 3.78 on a scale of one to&#13;
five. Staff find it more difficult to make use of specific skills and techniques (mean =&#13;
3.49 on the same scale). The factors that facilitate use are relevance of the content of the&#13;
learning to the work of the participant and support from managers and peers. Lack of&#13;
time, money, and staff resources are the main barriers to HDN learning utilization.&#13;
&#13;
HDN learning programs had some positive impact&#13;
&#13;
6.15    The impact of the HDN learning events is almost exclusively focused on&#13;
awareness raising and building understanding of the HDN business, rather than directly&#13;
affecting the objectives of the Network. Events that teach new and improve existing&#13;
knowledge and skills are the ones with the highest impact ratings.&#13;
&#13;
Relationship between learning participation and effectiveness, utilization and impact&#13;
&#13;
6.16    What is evident from the 4-step regression analysis is that there is no statistically&#13;
significant relationship between levels of participation (e.g. the number of days per year&#13;
staff spend on HD learning) and perceived effectiveness, utilization and impact. This&#13;
suggests that the levels of learning participation are really not a matter in producing&#13;
impacts. What seems the most important is the relevance of the learning, as well as the&#13;
quality thereof.&#13;
&#13;
                                   RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
6.17    Drawing on the key findings and gaps identified by this evaluation, we offer the&#13;
following recommendations to improve the HDN learning programs:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          67&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      (1)   Equip staff with more applicable tools and skills;&#13;
&#13;
      (2)   Design     learning   programs     that  integrate   behavioral    components&#13;
            (communication, interpersonal and leadership) with HD operational and&#13;
            technical components;&#13;
&#13;
      (3)   Make the learning more relevant and applicable to staff work objectives by&#13;
            providing more demand-driven, just-in-time, and cutting-edge training;&#13;
&#13;
      (4)   Improve the design of sessions to increase team-based, peer, client and multi-&#13;
            sectoral learning and informal networking;&#13;
&#13;
      (5)   Select and utilize the most welcome and effective delivery modes, such as&#13;
            PDGs, to deliver the learning programs;&#13;
&#13;
      (6)   Explore ways to increase the level of participation of older, more experienced&#13;
            staff and under-privileged learners; and&#13;
&#13;
      (7)   Explore ways to make technical learning more readily available to country&#13;
            office staff.&#13;
&#13;
Equip staff with more applicable tools and skills.&#13;
&#13;
6.18    The HDN learning program should focus on equipping staff with more applicable&#13;
tools and skills if the Network wants to increase the impact of staff learning and improve&#13;
performance and quality of work. The current learning offered by the Network is mainly&#13;
raises awareness. This type of learning is non-specific and does not often translate into&#13;
results on the overall business performance level.&#13;
&#13;
Design learning programs that integrate behavioral components (communication,&#13;
interpersonal and leadership) with HD operational and technical components.&#13;
&#13;
6.19    The HDN learning program could benefit from incorporating behavioral&#13;
learning. HD managers specifically stated that the skills staff need to work efficiently&#13;
within the HD are in the areas of behavioral, communication and team leadership&#13;
training. As these types of skills fall outside of core HD training, the learning program&#13;
does not include such learning events.         However, because managers value these&#13;
interpersonal skills very highly, the HDN learning program may want to include them in&#13;
their LP. Incorporating some behavioral components into the HDN LP would equip staff&#13;
with both technical knowledge and the behavioral skills necessary to improve efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
Make the learning more relevant and applicable to staff daily by providing more&#13;
demand-driven, just-in-time, and cutting-edge training.&#13;
&#13;
6.20    Given that even low-level learning participation may still generate positive&#13;
outcomes and impacts, the learning program should focus on increasing the effectiveness,&#13;
relevance, and applicability of staff learning. For instance, making the learning demand&#13;
driven and just-in-time is something that managers emphasize as important both in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
68&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reaching low-intensity learners and improving the existing learning offerings.          One&#13;
suggestion for improvement of the HDN learning program is to offer more team building,&#13;
behavioral, general leadership, and communications learning especially targeted to HD&#13;
staff.&#13;
&#13;
Improve the design of sessions to increase team based, peer, client and multi-&#13;
sectoral learning and informal networking.&#13;
&#13;
6.21   To be more effective, HDN could shift from the current pedagogical, classroom-&#13;
delivery mode to an andragogical (adult learning) delivery mode, as this mode of design&#13;
and delivery has been found to be more effective with adult learners.&#13;
&#13;
Select and utilize the most welcome and effective delivery modes, such as PDGs, to&#13;
deliver the learning programs.&#13;
&#13;
6.22   To enhance staff learning and to ensure the best outcome of the learning&#13;
programs, HDN should carefully select and utilize the most welcome and effective&#13;
delivery modes suggested by HD staff, such as PDGs, to deliver the learning programs.&#13;
&#13;
Explore ways to increase the level of participation of older, more experienced staff&#13;
and under-privileged learners.&#13;
&#13;
6.23   Although most of the HDN learning program is well aligned with staff learning&#13;
needs and the participation levels, quality and effectiveness of the events are up to&#13;
standard, there are a few areas where the Network could improve its learning program to&#13;
include under-privileged learners and facilitate the utilization and impact of the learning&#13;
that HD staff attend. The HND learning program needs to ensure that this group of staff&#13;
remain life-long learners, learn from each other, and stay on the cutting-edge of the&#13;
knowledge frontier.    For instance, HDN could improve the level of participation in&#13;
learning by designing learning activities to attract older, senior, and more experienced&#13;
staff. These staff have been found to be low intensity learners. Further investigation and&#13;
expertise is required to understand the factors that contribute to successful adult learning,&#13;
including how to motivate and inspire senior staff to attend more staff learning. In&#13;
addition, non-traditional methods of learning need to be explored in order to better reach&#13;
the senior staff. One recommendation is that HDN conduct learning needs assessments&#13;
targeted to low intensity and non-learners.&#13;
&#13;
Explore ways to make technical learning more readily available to country office&#13;
staff.&#13;
&#13;
6.24   Another under-privileged group of staff is staff that are stationed outside of HQ.&#13;
Specifically, the HDN learning program needs to include country office staff in sector-&#13;
specific/technical, and cutting-edge learning. Currently, BBLs make up a large part of&#13;
the technical learning events offered, however, they are almost exclusively available to&#13;
HQ staff.    Country office staff have few opportunities to attend HQ-based learning&#13;
events.   This is an important challenge for the HD Network, keeping in mind that&#13;
distance learning methods such as video conferencing, B-Span and E-Learning are rated&#13;
the least effective of all HDN learning delivery modes. In order to increase the amount&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          69&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of sector-specific and technical learning that country office staff receive, it is&#13;
recommended that HDN explores ways of making BBLs more accessible to the country&#13;
office staff. For instance, the HD Learning Days, which are especially important to&#13;
country office staff, could be a venue for increased transmission of technical and cutting-&#13;
edge skills to country office staff.&#13;

            This report focuses on the first
            component - a review of HDN staff learning programs. The key
            evaluation question addressed is, is the HDN learning
            program doing the right thing, in terms of the level of
            alignment with the objectives of the HD Network and
            fulfillment of the HD staff learning needs? The answer to
            this question was obtained by examining the following four
            secondary evaluation questions: (1) Did HDN learning
            programs enhance staff competency? (2) How well are HDN
            learning programs aligned with HDN business objectives? (3)
            What is the level of HD staff learning participation? (4)
            How effective are HDN learning programs?
