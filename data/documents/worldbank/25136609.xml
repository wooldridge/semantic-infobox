&amp;#12;&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
The City of Kampala is uniquely situated on a number of          Impact of Urbanization on Environmental Assets&#13;
low rolling hills linked by wide valleys of wetlands that have&#13;
defined the character and functions of the city throughout       40% of the population lives in unplanned, densely&#13;
its history. In past decades the city has undergone a period     populated informal settlements that lack basic provision&#13;
of rapid urbanization that has significantly altered the scale   of water, storm drainage, sewage treatment, and solid&#13;
and character of urban development as well as degraded           waste collection. While an array of political, social,&#13;
the quality of the wetlands and other key environment            and economic factors have driven the informality of&#13;
assets of the city. With an annual population growth rate        development, the high demand for affordable and&#13;
above or near 4% for 30 years and a large number of new          accessible land for housing has been a primary cause. The&#13;
migrants arriving year after year, the cityâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to        scale of the environmental management problems, due&#13;
provide adequate housing and public services for these           to the vast area of informality, is clearly unprecedented&#13;
new residents and to absorb them within the formal               and has led to the severe degradation of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economy has been severely challenged.                            environmental assets, particularly the quality and function&#13;
                                                                 of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s aquatic ecosystems.&#13;
At the same time, climate change is further straining the&#13;
cityâ&#128;&#153;s ability to address urban environmental problems.          From 1989 to 2010, corresponding with explosive&#13;

inevitably be some amount of natural resource and                  â&#128;¢	 Development of a profile of natural assets at&#13;
ecosystem loss. Kampala has arguably pursued a â&#128;&#156;build                 the metropolitan scale and a broad strategy&#13;
everywhereâ&#128;&#157; approach. Development has proceeded                       to address pressures on these assets;&#13;
with little awareness or sensitivity of the overall impacts        â&#128;¢	 Identification of specific opportunities for&#13;

asset systems within physical development.                            to these opportunities forwards;&#13;

is a structure to balance development and mitigate the&#13;
loss of assets, or to preserve or even enhance them. A&#13;
strategic concept would provide the platform for the city&#13;
to use innovative tools; such as development offsets, now&#13;
being considered. Wetland degradation is the primary&#13;
example. Historically, the Kampala region has been&#13;
uniquely bestowed with an abundance of this highly&#13;
valuable natural resource. Within KCCA, this resource is&#13;
now largely goneâ&#128;&#148;resulting in what could be described as&#13;
the very the opposite of â&#128;&#156;Green Urban Development.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Development in Kampala and its environmental impacts&#13;
needs to be considered at the metropolitan scale. The&#13;
broader metropolitan region still has critical natural assets,&#13;
such as the large area of wetlands east of Murchison&#13;
Bay, which should be protected and conserved as&#13;
urbanization expands. Proper consideration of proposals&#13;
for development in the context of the remaining assets can&#13;
allow the city to avoid the mistakes of the past.&#13;
&#13;
Valuable ecosystems are under acute pressure, and action&#13;
will need to be taken soon if their continued deterioration&#13;
is to be arrested. From a fiscal perspective, Kampala will&#13;
have limited resources to invest in gray infrastructure&#13;
that is required to offset the degradation of the green&#13;
asset base. Given these constraints, leadership and&#13;
institutional actionsâ&#128;&#148;feasible and capable of addressing&#13;
key problemsâ&#128;&#148;are particularly important.&#13;

&amp;#12;II.	     BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT&#13;
Kampala has experienced decades of significant urban&#13;
growth and is currently the second-fastest-growing city&#13;
in Eastern Africa. As Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s capital city, Kampala is the&#13;
industrial, commercial, and education center and vital to&#13;
the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth. As shown in Figureâ&#128;&#130;1,&#13;
the city (referred to as the Kampala City Center Area or&#13;
KCCA), is within the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area&#13;
(GKMA), which also includes the inner suburbs, the outer&#13;
dormitory towns and suburbs, peripheral towns, and peri-                                   KCCA&#13;
urban extension to the south-west towards the Entebbe&#13;
community (referred to as the KMTC) (KCCA, 2012).&#13;
KCCA consists of five urban divisions, including: Central,&#13;
Kawempe, Makindye, Lubaga and Nakawa. Collectively,&#13;
these divisions cover a total of 189 square km, with 169&#13;
square km of land and approximately 20 square km of&#13;
water. The GKMA is a 970 km2 area roughly defined by&#13;
a 20km radius from Kampala City Centre that includes&#13;
171 parishes, of which 99 are in Kampala District, nine in&#13;
Mukono District and 63 in Wakiso District (Uganda Ministry&#13;
of Works and Transport, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
The city of Kampala developed on hills linked by wide&#13;
valleys of wetlands and river channels that flow into the&#13;
                                                               Figureâ&#128;&#130;1â&#128;&#131;â&#128;&#131; Political Boundaries of the KCCA (area within red outline&#13;

Kampala has grown outward from the urban center along&#13;
upland corridors, with development spreading down the&#13;
slopes of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s 24 hills into the low-lying wetland&#13;
areas (Figureâ&#128;&#130;2, N.B. darker colors indicate areas of&#13;
steep topography). This growth has led to an increasingly&#13;
inefficient pattern of development that encroaches into&#13;
wetland areas. This pattern has furthermore presented&#13;
difficulties for provision of adequate sanitation, drainage,&#13;
flood control and environmental asset protection in&#13;
addition to proving costly for the government to service&#13;
(KCCA, 2013; Fichtner, 2014).&#13;
&#13;
About 23% of the GKMA is fully urbanized, a significant&#13;
portion (60%) is semi-urbanized, and the remainder&#13;
consists of rural settlements. These rural areas are those&#13;
generally not represented by color overlays (Figureâ&#128;&#130;3)&#13;
(KCCA, 2014b). By contrast, the KCCA is almost entirely&#13;
developed, with less than 10% of the land mass vacant.&#13;
Approximately 7% of the GKMA area is wetlands (KCCA,&#13;
2012).&#13;
                                                                                                     Murchison&#13;
                                                                                                       Bay&#13;
A consequence of rapid urbanization has been the overall&#13;
decline in the quality of the urban natural environment.&#13;
The impacts of climate change have exacerbated the rate&#13;
and extent of environmental degradation and have made&#13;
the cityâ&#128;&#153;s efforts toward environmental management all the&#13;
more challenging.&#13;

&amp;#12;As Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s population has increased, open space&#13;
and undeveloped land in the city center has been&#13;
replaced with development that has often occurred in&#13;
environmentally vulnerable areas. Figureâ&#128;&#130;6 illustrates&#13;
Kampala spatial development from 1989 to 2010. Prior to&#13;
1989, most development occurred within upland areas of&#13;
the urban core and along major transportation corridors,&#13;
which represented 27% of KCCAâ&#128;&#153;s total land area (Abebe,&#13;
2013). With the increase in population, particularly&#13;
the in-migration of the rural poor, development spread&#13;
to unplanned areas on the lower slopes and low-lying&#13;
drainage corridors and marginal areas: areas are often&#13;
prone to flooding and are environmentally vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
From 1989 to 2010, the area of developed land increased&#13;
from 27% to 78% (Abebe, 2013). Figureâ&#128;&#130;7 illustrates&#13;
the trend in the conversion of land from undeveloped           Figureâ&#128;&#130;6â&#128;&#131;â&#128;&#131; Spatial development from 1989 to 2010 in GKMA and KCCA&#13;

Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s urban development has been residential,&#13;
which covers approximately 23% of the GKMA landmass&#13;
(over 60% of the total developed areas in the GKMA) and&#13;
approximately 64% of the KCCA land area. Employment-&#13;
associated land uses account for 3% of the GKMA land area&#13;
and 10% of the KCCA. Public services and facilities land&#13;
uses are 2% of the GKMA and 6% of the KCCA (KCCA, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
A recent survey estimated that 40% of the city population,&#13;
and much of the recent migration, live in informal&#13;
settlements and/or slums that lack basic infrastructure&#13;
services for the provision of water, storm drainage, sewage&#13;
treatment, and solid waste collection (KCCA, 2012).&#13;
While an array of practical and social factors have driven&#13;
informality, the demand for affordable and accessible          Figureâ&#128;&#130;7â&#128;&#131;â&#128;&#131; KCCA Undeveloped and Developed Land, 1985-2010&#13;
housing has been key. Planning scenario projections            Source: AECOM created chart with data from Abebe, 2013&#13;
indicate that the demand for land could vary between&#13;
200,000 ha in the worst case scenario to around 100,000&#13;
ha in the best case scenario by 2040 (Figureâ&#128;&#130;8).The dense&#13;
informal settlements predominate at the edges of the&#13;
wetland corridors throughout the city and, as later sections&#13;
of this document will discuss, have become one of the key&#13;
drivers of environmental degradation of the water quality&#13;
in wetlands and drainage courses.&#13;

&amp;#12;Climate Change&#13;
As Kampala is located near the equator, there is little&#13;
fluctuation in the average temperature throughout the&#13;
year. Temperatures range from average lows in the mid-60s&#13;
F to average highs in the low 80s F. However, the tropical&#13;
rainforest climate provides variation, with two annual&#13;
wet seasons. There is a long rainy season from August&#13;
to December and a short rainy season from February to&#13;
June that has substantially heavier rainfall per month. The&#13;
average annual rainfall is between 1,750 and 2,000 mm,&#13;
with monthly rainfall ranging from approximately 50mm to&#13;
260mm (World Meteorological Organization, 2013 in UN              Figureâ&#128;&#130;9â&#128;&#131;â&#128;&#131; Monthly Rainfall Recorded at Makerere University&#13;
Habitat 2013) (Figureâ&#128;&#130;9). Recent climate projections for                         May 2012-April 2013&#13;
Uganda conclude that while overall rainfall totals for the        Source: UN Habitat, 2013&#13;
country may remain similar to the present, and Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
total rainfall may decrease (Figureâ&#128;&#130;10), the seasonality&#13;
of rainfall may see a longer wet season that extends from&#13;
September through to the start of the February rainy&#13;
season (Baastel, 2014, Baastel, 2014b).&#13;
&#13;
Projected climate change impacts for Kampala anticipate&#13;
an increase in temperature and decrease in overall&#13;
precipitation, threatening water supplies (Baastel,&#13;
2014). Recent analysis focused on Kampala suggests a&#13;
temperature increase of 1.5ÂºC to 3.0ÂºC by 2095 (Figureâ&#128;&#130;11)&#13;
and a 20 mm decrease in precipitation by 2095 (Figureâ&#128;&#130;10)&#13;
under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions projection.&#13;
(Baastel, 2014). Furthermore, a rise in mean annual&#13;
                                                                  Figureâ&#128;&#130;10â&#128;&#131;â&#128;&#131; Observed and Future Rainfall in Kampala&#13;
temperatures could intensify an urban heat island effect          Source: Baastel, 2014&#13;
that where built-up areas absorb and generate more&#13;
heat than nearby rural areas. This combination of higher&#13;
temperatures could strain water resources by reducing&#13;
flows and degrading quality.&#13;

&amp;#12;The city has already experienced an increase in rainfall&#13;
during extreme climate events. Rainfall data is being&#13;
developed at a weather station installed at Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Makerere University as part of a flood modeling program.&#13;
While there is limited modeling and few weather stations,&#13;
the analysis indicates an increase in intensity of rainfall&#13;
and greater likelihood of extreme weather effects that can&#13;
cause harm to human and natural systems (UN-Habitat,&#13;
2013).&#13;
&#13;
The increase in rainfall has already exacerbated existing&#13;
chronic urban environmental management conditions due&#13;
to rapid urbanization without corresponding development&#13;
of urban services. The City of Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s Carbon Disclosure&#13;

seasonality of rainfall are already a serious risk, affecting   Source: Daily Monitor November, 29 2014&#13;
the predictability of planting and harvesting and increasing&#13;
already-chronic flooding (CDP, 2013). Low-lying areas&#13;
of informal settlements will continue to be the most&#13;
vulnerable as they are already located in hazard prone&#13;
areas and are subject to flooding and or high storm runoff&#13;
from the adjacent hills (UN-Habitat, 2012). During heavy&#13;
rains in June and November, 2014, there were news reports&#13;
of trees uprooted and latrine slabs lifted and carried by&#13;
floodwaters, polluting waters with human waste (Daily&#13;
Monitor, June 10, 2014; UGO News, 2014). Public health&#13;
challenges from increased flooding include the rise of&#13;
cholera outbreaks during the rainy season (Lwasa, 2010).&#13;
&#13;
Although new information about climate change specific&#13;
to Kampala is underdevelopment (Baastel, 2014), the&#13;
cityâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to address climate change mitigation and&#13;
adaptation actions have been limited. There is a Climate&#13;
Change unit within the Ministry of Water and Environment,&#13;
but a national policy on climate change has yet to be&#13;
produced. However, there is no local adaptation policy&#13;
to comprehensively address climate change issues in an&#13;
integrated and strategic manner. There is an inherently&#13;
low capacity to adapt to climate change given the large&#13;
population of urban poor, the un-serviced informal&#13;
settlements, and inadequate urban services in general&#13;
(Lwasa, 2010).&#13;

&amp;#12;III.	 QUALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSETS&#13;
Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s key environmental assets are predominantly the&#13;
network of wetland waterways that course throughout the&#13;
city, delivering a suite of ecological services, including flood&#13;
attenuation, water purification, and wastewater treatment.&#13;
The quality and function of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s aquatic system has&#13;
been significantly degraded. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s terrestrial assets are&#13;
composed of hills, open spaces, and trees. These areas are&#13;
being rapidly developed and lack formal protection and&#13;
environmental management. While there is limited data&#13;
available about the cityâ&#128;&#153;s air quality, existing findings show&#13;
increased degradation due to the rise in vehicle emissions.&#13;
Furthermore, the lack of national air quality standards will&#13;
continue to delay establishment of baseline monitoring.&#13;

The City of Kampala and the GKMA are rich with aquatic&#13;
environmental assets. The urban fabric has been shaped&#13;
by the wetlands and the waters that flow into Murchison&#13;
Bay on Lake Victoria (Figureâ&#128;&#130;2). These aquatic ecosystems&#13;
provide floodwater attenuation, sewage treatment, water&#13;
purification, food, and building materials, while areas such&#13;
as Lutembe Bay, designated an Important Bird Area by&#13;
BirdLife International, provide critical habitat for the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
biodiversity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wetlands&#13;
The City has relied on Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s wetlands throughout&#13;
the settlementâ&#128;&#153;s history to provide numerous ecological&#13;
services that support the City:&#13;

ecosystem, the remaining area of wetlands constitutes                    within the KCCA. Known encroachment of permanent and&#13;
approximately 9% of the total Kampala City surface area,                 seasonal wetlands is illustrated in the purple and blue&#13;
according to recent spatial analysis based on satellite                  areas, while the built-up areas at the edges of wetlands&#13;

throughout its history.                                                  converted for development, and by 1999, 46 % of the&#13;

&amp;#12;Degradation of the Nakivubo and its deteriorating water&#13;
quality has caused the National Water and Sewerage&#13;
Corporation (NWSC) to relocate their raw water intake and&#13;
treatment facility as a result of increased treatment costs&#13;

treatment in Kampala is pollution of the water source at&#13;

from Nakivubo Channel (MOE Dir of Water, 2010). The&#13;
treatment costs at the Gaba Water Works facility near the&#13;
outlet of the Nakivubo increased fourfold over the last 10&#13;
years as a result of the encroachment of Nakivubo and&#13;

loads coming from wetlands feeding the Bay (MWE, 2014),           could threaten wetland and lake health if similar-scale&#13;

(Uganda Breweries and Ngege Fish), contributes about&#13;
40% of the Bayâ&#128;&#153;s partially treated discharge (Akurut, 2014).&#13;
Another significant source of partially treated effluent comes&#13;
from the Bugolobi Sewerage Treatment Works (BSTW),&#13;

&amp;#12;The regulatory context for the development of the land&#13;
during the colonial period established conditions that led to&#13;
further environmental degradation beyond the challenges&#13;
of working with the physiography. Urban development of&#13;
the land under the control of the British Crown was subject&#13;
to formal planning, while the area occupied by the local&#13;
African population evolved organically without formal&#13;
physical planning (Koojo, 2005). Decades of expanding&#13;
urban development has led to the clearance of much of&#13;
the natural vegetation on the hill tops and slopes. This has&#13;
destabilized the soil and caused increased runoff, erosion,&#13;
siltation, and flooding in the low lying areas between.&#13;
&#13;
The topography has also made it very challenging to             Photo: Hillside Development in Kampala.&#13;
develop a well-organized road and/or public transport           Source: AECOM&#13;
system. For ease of construction and to reduce costs, the&#13;
transport infrastructure is located in low-lying areas. The&#13;
impacts of road construction, the disturbance of land on&#13;
either side of the road, increased runoff, the parcelization&#13;
of wetland sections, and the disruption of hydrology&#13;
functions have also contributed to the degradation of&#13;
wetlands. At the same time, low-lying roads also facilitate&#13;
the informal settlement of wetland edges alongside new&#13;
roads (i.e. Northern Bypass).&#13;

&amp;#12;The Namanve Forest Reserve is a formally gazetted area&#13;
of forest located in Kira district, approximately 15km east&#13;
of Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s city center. While approximately 1,000 ha&#13;
were de-gazetted in 1997 and allocated to the Uganda&#13;
Investment Authority for development, approximately&#13;
1,200 ha remained as gazetted. While there are numerous&#13;
reports in local media concerning development activities&#13;
occurring within the forest reserve, such as tree plantations&#13;
and housing settlements, the state of this environmental&#13;
asset is not widely documented (New Vision, 2013c; Daily&#13;
Monitor, 2013; Observer, 2013).&#13;
&#13;
Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s seasonal rains (August to December and&#13;
February to June), which generate pollutant-laden&#13;
stormwater runoff that spreads across the land, also&#13;
influence the diversity of vegetation growth by season.&#13;
For example, vegetation studies of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s Mapererwe&#13;
Landfill area at Kiteezi reveal that while there are 108&#13;
plant species observed growing in the area during the&#13;
dry season, an additional 37 plant species were recorded&#13;
growing during the wet season (AWE, 2013). Additionally,&#13;
eight of the dry season species are specially adapted to&#13;
growing only in dry conditions and are not present during         Figureâ&#128;&#130;20â&#128;&#131;â&#128;&#131; Natural Resources and Open Spaces in Kampala&#13;
wet season conditions (AWE, 2013). This increase in species       Source: KCCA, 2012&#13;
composition during wet seasons is partially attributed to&#13;
higher level pollutant loads that accumulate on slopes&#13;
following stormwater runoff events (AWE, 2013). Plants            In addition to extensive birdlife located in Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s natural&#13;

&amp;#12;Kampala prepared a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory&#13;
in 2012, using 2012 as the inventory base year. Solid&#13;
waste and wastewater discharge sectors contributed&#13;
the greatest amount of GHG emissions, 42% and 23%&#13;
respectively. These numbers reflect the lack of mechanisms&#13;
for capturing methane, a high-intensity greenhouse&#13;
gas, at the cityâ&#128;&#153;s Mpererwe Landfill. Furthermore, the&#13;
significant amount of emissions from sanitation reflects&#13;
the use of pit latrines, septic systems, and other non-&#13;
central sewage collection systems that release methane&#13;
without any capture by treatment facilities (Lwasa, 2013).&#13;

Overview of Air Quality Trends&#13;
Based on the limited data available from a pilot study and&#13;
media reports, Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s local air quality appears to show&#13;
signs of poor quality with regard to particulate matter&#13;
from vehicles, road dust and biomass burning. While data&#13;
from air quality measurements at the city landfills in the&#13;
outer-lying area of the city conforms to the draft national&#13;
standards, it is likely that additional air quality monitoring&#13;
of Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s urbanized areas, similar to the 2014&#13;
Schwander et al. study, will continue to show a correlation&#13;
of poor air quality where there is significant vehicle and&#13;
road presence. The absence of adopted, national air quality&#13;
standards will likely delay any significant efforts to generate&#13;
comprehensive baseline data with periodic monitoring of&#13;
the cityâ&#128;&#153;s air quality.                                           Photo: Kampala on a day with extensive air pollution.&#13;

From a greenhouse gas (GHG) perspective, Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
establishment of a 2012 GHG baseline is a strong start&#13;
for assessing future GHG emissions trends and evaluating&#13;
impacts from GHG mitigation activities, such as the&#13;
proposed landfill gas capture infrastructure for Mpererwe&#13;
Landfill. Given the growth of vehicles in Kampala (see&#13;
Drivers section on Air Emissions), it is anticipated that GHG&#13;
emissions from vehicles will grow. Future GHG inventories&#13;
will be needed to evaluate whether improved solid&#13;
waste management and construction of new wastewater&#13;
treatment facilities with higher levels of overall sewerage&#13;
treatment will be effective in capturing GHG emissions and&#13;
preventing their release into the atmosphere.&#13;

&amp;#12;The density and location of the informally settled slum           There is no national or local government mechanism&#13;

&amp;#12;C.	        Stormwater Runoff&#13;
Expansion of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s drainage system has not kept up&#13;
with the rapid urban growth and development of informal&#13;
settlements. As previously stated, Kampala has seen a&#13;
197% increase in the number of buildings constructed in&#13;
the city from 2004-2010. The extent of impervious surfaces&#13;
and compacted land area, the higher rates of precipitation&#13;
and increasing storm events, and poor maintenance of&#13;
the existing drainage system collectively have caused an&#13;
increase in the volume and coefficient of runoff. This lack&#13;
of an adequate drainage system required to manage storm&#13;
water runoff and flooding is a key driver of Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
environmental asset degradation. A reduction in pervious&#13;
land creates greater storm water runoff volumes, leading to&#13;
increased flooding and increased pollution of waterways as&#13;
storm water collects solid and liquid waste from settlement&#13;
areas and roads, transporting pollutants into the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
wetlands.&#13;
&#13;
Between 2004 and 2010, Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s amount of impervious&#13;
roof area has grown 262% across the city with substantial&#13;
increases in each drainage area (Figureâ&#128;&#130;22) (Tableâ&#128;&#130;4). Also,&#13;
                                                                        Figureâ&#128;&#130;22â&#128;&#131;â&#128;&#131; Increase in Roof Area per Catchment, 2004-2010&#13;
the buildings have generally increased in size, leading to an           Source: UN, 2013&#13;
even higher rate of increase in roof area. These conditions&#13;
have increased the frequency and severity of flooding&#13;
problems throughout the city. A detailed case study&#13;
analysis as part of the Kampala Flood Risk Management&#13;
Report 2013 shows that the amount of impervious surfaces&#13;
in a catchment is a major determinant of the volume and&#13;
speed of surface water runoff and therefore flooding (UN-&#13;
Habitat, 2013).&#13;

waste collection to slum locations, including Kawempe,             develop a facility. In addition to households dumping waste&#13;
Kampala central, Lubaga, Makindye, and Nakawa divisions            into stormwater channels, sewers, or public areas, there is&#13;
(Madinah et al., 2014). Early analysis shows that solid            illegal dumping and burning by refuse collectors or building&#13;
waste management efficiency of collection has improved             contractors. There is very little organized waste collection&#13;
by approximately 10% in the last 2 years (Madinah et al.,          and disposal in KMTC. Medical and other toxic waste is&#13;

&amp;#12;The waste that is collected, transported and disposed               The high organic composition of Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s solid waste&#13;
at the cityâ&#128;&#153;s only landfill at Mpererwe contributes to              is a driver of water quality degradation. According to&#13;
degradation of water and air resources. Inefficient                 Madinah et al, 2014, almost 74 percent of the garbage&#13;
leachate treatment at the landfill results in effluent that         generated in the city is organic, while the rest is inorganic,&#13;
does not comply with national standards while the lack              comprising glass, plastic, paper, metals, and construction&#13;
of landfill gas collection results in release of methane, a         and demolition waste (Figureâ&#128;&#130;24). The high composition&#13;
high-intensity greenhouse gas emission (IFC, 2013). Tableâ&#128;&#130;6         of organic solid waste can cause considerable nutrient&#13;
shows the general lack of environmental compliance of               loading of drainage channels and wetlands, once the waste&#13;
leachate treatment effluent, which degrades environmental           is transported into Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s water bodies. The resultant&#13;
assets and adjacent community resources when the                    nutrient concentrations contribute to algae growth and&#13;
leachate is carried away from the landfill via groundwater,         other indicators of high nutrient levels observed in the&#13;
stormwater and soil erosion. During heavy rains, the                waters near Gaba treatment works and other wetlands&#13;
lack of a stormwater management system contributes to               throughout the city (Ooyo, 2009).&#13;
flooding of the leachate treatment system which enables&#13;
untreated leachate to mix with stormwater and move off&#13;
site (AWE, 2013). The landfillâ&#128;&#153;s leachate discharged into&#13;
groundwater, without full treatment by reed beds, has&#13;
posed a significant health risk to the adjacent community.&#13;
Specifically, water analysis from three nearby community&#13;
boreholes that access an aquifer adjacent to the landfill&#13;
showed that the levels of lead were 20, 80 and 90 times,&#13;
respectively, higher than the national standard for potable&#13;
water (AWE, 2013). Lead exposure, particularly for children,&#13;
can cause numerous health effects and have a harmful&#13;
impact on childrenâ&#128;&#153;s learning and behavior (WHO, 2014).&#13;
The high levels of lead at the landfill are attributed to           Figureâ&#128;&#130;24â&#128;&#131;â&#128;&#131; Composition of Solid Waste Collected&#13;
alloys, paints and batteries (AWE, 2013). The landfill also         Source: Madinah et al, 2014&#13;
emits methane from the decomposition of wastes. While&#13;
a system was designed to capture the landfillâ&#128;&#153;s methane&#13;
and convert the gas into an energy source, the system has&#13;
not yet been installed, enabling this high-intensity GHG to&#13;
contribute to global climate change (AWE, 2013).&#13;

Another factor in air quality in Kampala is the large&#13;
number of motorbikes (or â&#128;&#156;boda-bodasâ&#128;&#157;) driven in the&#13;
city. Motorcycles have a significant impact on air quality&#13;
as they generate more pollution per Km than other&#13;
vehicles. Boda-boda usage data is variable. In Uganda,&#13;
since 2009, approximately twice as many boda-bodas have&#13;
been imported compared to all other vehicles combined&#13;
(Tableâ&#128;&#130;10). KCCA Strategic Plan recently noted that a free&#13;
registration exercise recorded 55,000 motorcycles (KCCA,&#13;
2014b). In 2011, boda-bodas accounted for 42% of vehicles&#13;
on Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s roads but only carried 8.5% of the passengers&#13;
(Figureâ&#128;&#130;24) (KCCA, n.d.a).&#13;

with the expanding number of vehicles in the city has led&#13;
to traffic congestion. Vehicles idling in traffic contribute to&#13;
greenhouse gas emissions in addition to GHGs released&#13;
when moving to the destination point. In 2011, a baseline&#13;
of automobile traffic flow on Kampala roads was recorded&#13;
at 181,216 vehicles per day (KCCA, 2011 as cited in&#13;
Watundu, 2013). Limited availability of data inhibits a&#13;
comparison of average traffic counts in Kampala from&#13;
additional years.&#13;

Land management (such as the issuing of land titles)&#13;
is largely centralized and is the function of MoLHUD.&#13;
However, MoLHUD has established zonal offices and at              Institutional Challenges&#13;
various places, co-locates its officers with local government&#13;
for the processing of land titles and the Land Information&#13;
System. For example, there is one MoLHUD officer residing         1.	 Institutional fragmentation â&#128;&#147; overlapping mandates,&#13;

land titles for Kampala. Typically, private developers or             earlier, both national-level (MoLHUD, MWE, NEMA,&#13;
the local government submit the requests to MoLHUD for                Wetlands Department) and city-level agencies (KCCA)&#13;
issuance of land titles. Having the close physical proximity          are directly involved in different aspects of land and&#13;
of MoLHUD officer in KCCA enhances the coordination and               urban environment management and their regulatory&#13;
interaction during this process.                                      scope and responsibilities overlap.&#13;
&#13;
Physical planning, on the other hand, is largely                  As Kampala has a unique physical characteristic of&#13;
decentralized. Physical Planning Committees are                   numerous low rolling hills linked by wide valleys of&#13;
established at the district, urban and local levels and           wetlands, the balance between developing on the hills&#13;
charged with the development of their respective local            and protecting the integrity and functions of the wetlands&#13;
physical development plans, approval of development               are especially important for the sustainable development&#13;
applications and other related development control                of the city. However, there are multiple institutional&#13;
functions (in this case under the charge of the KCCA              fragmentation with regards to the management of&#13;
Physical Planning Directorate). A pre-requisite to submitting     wetlands â&#128;&#147; at both the national level and also vertically&#13;
a planning application is the proof of land title.                with the local level.&#13;

Thus far, data and information on land and physical               At the national level within MWE, functions of NEMA and&#13;

    the national and city-level agencies are weak especially      officers. While joint inspections (conducted by the related&#13;

    ministry level staff had to be recruited centrally through        provide backstopping support and reinforcement when&#13;

Obviously, the lack in staff capacity poses serious constraint        to national level goals. This division of work could&#13;

Even with all necessary structure and regulations in place,           to management and enforcement. It is imperative to&#13;

departments for consistency, or to ensure that conditions             amendment of existing laws or a commitment to&#13;

   with other information systems for development (eg.              impacts to communities (eg. improvements to public&#13;

    sharing of information and aligning database                    for licensing or permits) and publish public guideline&#13;
    compatibility and information coherence amongst                 documents through means (illustrations, pamphlets,&#13;
    agencies, to realizing mandatory consultations, aligning        websites etc.) easily accessible and understandable (in&#13;

            Promoting green urban development in
            African cities : Kampala, Uganda - urban environmental profile
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The city of Kampala has undergone a
            period of rapid urbanization that has contributed to the
            degradation of the city’s natural environment. The urban
            environmental profile for Kampala has been prepared as the
            first component of the assignment promoting green urban
            development in Africa: enhancing the relationship between
            urbanization, environmental assets, and ecosystem services,
            a project being conducted under the leadership of the World
            Bank. An overall objective of this project is to link the
            study of urban environmental issues with the advancement of
            more sustainable urban growth. The profile summarizes the
            existing quality of the wetlands and other aquatic and
            terrestrial environmental assets, identifies the key drivers
            that are the cause of their vulnerability, and describes the
            key institutional challenges and constraining factors that
            limit the city’s ability to address environmental management
            challenges. Identification of the key environmental assets
            and key drivers of environmental degradation within the city
            required a more comprehensive review of reports on urban
            planning and infrastructure services. The city has recently
            made progress in the development of key infrastructure
            systems such as solid waste management and sanitation. The
            report is organized as follows: section one gives
            introduction. Section two sets the background and context
            for Kampala, providing an overview of the impacts of rapid
            urbanization and climate change, drawing linkages to urban
            environmental assets. Section three, quality of the
            environmental assets of Kampala describes the state of the
            key environmental assets, including the terrestrial assets,
            aquatic assets, and air quality, and attempts to infer the
            associated historic and current trends. Section four,
            drivers of environmental vulnerability and degradation
            describes the key issues that are driving degradation and
            the impacts caused. Section five, institutional issues and
            challenges describes the key factors that constrain
            Kampala‘s ability to effectively address environmental
            management challenges. Section six, provides a synthesis of
            key findings.
