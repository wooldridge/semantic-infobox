BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL HIGHWAY REHAIBILITATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
I. TRANSPORT SECTOR OVERVIEW&#13;
A. The Transport Sector in the Economy&#13;
1.01   The transport sector accounts for a rather low RS$13 billion or 4.3 percent of Brazil's GNP. Road&#13;
transport alone accounts for about 3.2 percent. But these figures exclude the very important segments of&#13;
own-account transport, services by truck owner-operators, and private automobile use, which are not&#13;
accounted for in GNP calculations. Total transportation expenditures amount to about US$90 billion&#13;
equivalent and road transport accounts for 85% of that total (Table 1, Annex 10). The transport industry&#13;
has grown at rates which have systematically exceeded those of GDP. In the 1970s, when GDP increased&#13;
at an average 8.5 percent per year, the transport industry grew at over 11 percent per year; in the 1980s&#13;
and early 1990s, when GDP grew at an average 2 percent per year, the transport industry grew at an&#13;
average three percent per year (Table 2, Annex 10).&#13;
1.02   Public investments in transport, which used to account for about 40 percent of total public capital&#13;
formation in the 1960s and the early 1970s and reached 3.3 percent of GNP in 1975, have sharply&#13;
decreased to only one percent of GNP since 1981. Road expenditures in particular had to be curtailed&#13;
drastically, which resulted in the deterioration of large portions of the networks built in the 1950s and&#13;
1960s. The unsatisfactory operational and financial performance of the railways also led to under-&#13;
investment, insufficient maintenance, and to the deterioration of railway tracks, motive power and rolling&#13;
stock. Because of the size of the transport industry, of its direct impact upon the productive sectors, the&#13;
extensive involvement of the government and the fiscal implications, the performance of the transport sector&#13;
is critical to the success of the Government's economic stabilization and growth efforts.&#13;
B. The Transport System&#13;
1.03   Institutions. Through a Constitutional mandate, the Federation is required to operate interstate&#13;
and international rail, water, air and (passenger) road transport, including port and airport services, either&#13;
directly or through concessions or other forms of authorization. The state expanded its direct control over&#13;
the sector in the 1950s- 1970s. It took control of the many privately-owned railroads, merging them into the&#13;
federal (RFFSA) and the Sao Paulo state (FEPASA) railways, and it has retained majority shareholder&#13;
control, through Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), of the two other, primarily ore-carrier railroads.&#13;
The port facilities and operations, with some exceptions, have been incorporated into the former Portobras&#13;
system. The state, through the Portobras system, Petrobras for oil-specialized operations and CVRD for&#13;
minerals, and through concessions to private companies, has been controlling the country's entire port&#13;
system. In addition, the state owns and operates a substantial portion of the merchant fleet (through&#13;
Lloydbras, Petrobras and Docenave) and is present in inland shipping. The Federation also received a&#13;
mandate to regulate road freight transport through a law passed in 1984, but this industry has never been&#13;
regulated in practice and has generally remained efficient. By contrast, the State's direct control over the&#13;
railroads has led to their poor operational and financial performance and to inadequate railroad regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
1.04   Networks. The South and Southeast regions of Brazil have a dense system of highways and&#13;
railways. Substantial portions of the highway networks have deteriorated as a result of very heavy traffic&#13;
and inadequate maintenance; they now  require extensive rehabilitation.   Many highways require&#13;
strengthening and some also need to be widened. There is scope, however, for the railways to increase their&#13;
participation in the transport along the main north-south and export corridors, which could help postpone&#13;
some highway capacity investments. The Center-West, frontier region, where an unprecedented expansion&#13;
of agriculture has been taking place, has yet very sparse highway and feeder road networks, which need to&#13;
be gradually developed. The bulk of the region's exports is transported by truck at a very high cost.&#13;
Efficient inter-modal services based on the railways which connect the southeastem part of the region to&#13;
Sao Paulo-Santos and to Belo Horizonte-Vitoria and the northem part of the region to Sao Luis, as well as&#13;
on some of the rivers which flow from the region's periphery, could reduce these costs. The Northeast&#13;
region has a well-developed highway network, with substantially lower traffic levels, and an extensive&#13;
railway system which is under-utilized, except for the Carajas corridor. Coastal shipping has some&#13;
importance in both intra- and inter-regional trades. The North, with its sparse population and economic&#13;
activity, has traditionally relied upon river transport for both passenger and cargo movements in the&#13;
Amazon basin; there is scope to increase the efficiency of this form of transport. Air transport has an&#13;
increasing role in moving passengers and high-value goods over the long-distances involved.&#13;
1.05   Operations. There has been an alarming decline in the performance of the transport system,&#13;
overall, during the past two decades. The unstable macroeconomic environment and the efforts made to&#13;
control inflation through reducing public expenditures and containing the rates of the public companies, led&#13;
to the postponement of needed maintenance activities and capacity investments, to the rapid deterioration of&#13;
important portions of the transport system, including trunk highways, railway tracks, motive power and&#13;
rolling stock, and port facilities; and to traffic congestion in important corridors. The cost of road transport&#13;
on deteriorated and/or congested highways increased despite technological advances in the truck and bus&#13;
manufacturing industries. In addition to the poor state of assets and to the lack of integration among the&#13;
various transport systems, particularly ports and railroads, Government regulation or direct intervention im&#13;
the management of public enterprises, particularly by imposing uniform tariff policies and public service&#13;
obligations and reducing their ability to adapt to market and technological changes, led to the inefficient&#13;
operations, to poor service quality and to the chronic financial losses that charactenrze public companies.&#13;
This situation, together with the unattractive compensation packages offered in the public service, has led&#13;
to the present state of institutional degradation of the sector's public entities.&#13;
1.06   Investments.  Public investments in the transport sector, through the 1970s, went towards&#13;
expanding the transport system into the interior of the country to permit settlement and support new&#13;
economic activities, and towards increasing transport capacity on the eastern seaboard in line with the&#13;
growth of demand. The largest share went to the construction of the primary highways network. After the&#13;
first oil shock, federal priorities went to the railway and port infrastructure of the main corridors, in&#13;
support of the development of the steel industry and of mineral and grain exports. In the early 1980s,&#13;
public investments in the sector were scaled down drastically; and priorities gradually shifted from new&#13;
construction to maintenance and rehabilitation. However, the Government's austerity program and the&#13;
containment of the tariffs of revenue-earning entities led to the postponement of needed maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation works and to the deterioration of large portions of essential transport infrastructure sector-&#13;
wide. Investments in transport should therefore, in the short term, be focused on the rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of the facilities, and on selected improvements and capacity increases to the existing systems,&#13;
which are essential to the recovery of economic growth. They should primarily support the country's&#13;
agricultural and industrial growth, and export expansion objectives, and contribute to improving the&#13;
efficiency and performance of transport operators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
C. Sector Policy and Institutional Reform&#13;
1.07   The management of the transport sector is undergoing significant changes. A number of reforms,&#13;
which aim at reducing government expenditures in the sector, at deregulating and privatizing transport&#13;
services so as to allow market forces to be the primary determinant of the services provided, and at&#13;
decentralizing expenditure and financing responsibilities to lower levels of government, have been recently&#13;
undertaken or are about to be implemented. The Concession Law, enacted in February 1995, establishes&#13;
the legal framework for private concessions of public services. A proposal for a new Transport Law,&#13;
which would redefine the transport system under federal jurisdiction, is currently being considered by the&#13;
Congress. The following paragraphs summarize the status of these reforms.&#13;
1.08   Highways.  The Constitutional reform of 1988 decentralized fiscal revenues, transferring in&#13;
particular all road user charges to States and Municipalities, but kept unchanged the distribution of&#13;
responsibilities among the three administrative levels. The reform has therefore further affected the ability&#13;
of the Federation to rehabilitate and maintain an extensive federal highway network, and to finance needed&#13;
capacity investments. The Government has decided to reduce the size of the road network under federal&#13;
jurisdiction to those highways which are clearly of national interest, to transfer the operation and&#13;
maintenance of high-traffic highways as well as capacity investments to private concessionaires where&#13;
feasible, and to transfer other highways to state jurisdictions. A highway concession program has been&#13;
developed and is being implemented, with four concessions already in operation. Agreements have been&#13;
reached with the state governments on the conditions of the transfers, including on the funds needed for the&#13;
rehabilitation of the transferred highways. A proposal for a new Transport Law, which would reclassify&#13;
the transport system under federal jurisdiction, is before the Congress. The Government's highway&#13;
decentralization and concession programs are described in Chapter II; the proposed project (Chapter III)&#13;
would assist the Government in implementing the programs.&#13;
1.09   Railways. The Government is currently restructuring the federal railways (RFFSA) into six&#13;
regional operations and concessioning these operations to private operators, with assistance from the Bank&#13;
under the Federal Railways Restructuring and Privatization Project (Loan No. 4046-BR). About 17,000&#13;
redundant staff had their employment terminated and received separation benefits partly financed under the&#13;
Bank loan. Many are being retrained and will receive outplacement assistance. Five concessions have been&#13;
successfully auctioned and contracted, and the first ones already show substantial operational&#13;
improvements. Similarly, the Government of the State of Sao Paulo decided to restructure and to privatize&#13;
Ferrovia Paulista S.A., following a similar model. Finally, the Federal Government decided to privatize&#13;
CVRD, including the railways owned and operated by CVRD.&#13;
1.10   Ports. The Government closed the National Port Holding Company "Portobras" in 1990 and the&#13;
Congress approved a law for a broad deregulation of the port system in February 1993. The Port Law&#13;
liberalizes port activities, enabling private terminals to operate for public use and private port operators to&#13;
compete with the port administrations. It also decentralizes normative and tariff setting responsibilities to&#13;
newly-created local Port Authority Councils, and establishes port labor management entities. Some ports,&#13;
including Santos and Rio Grande, have made progress in implementing the reform. The Government has&#13;
recently developed an action plan for the full implementation of the reform, including the privatization of&#13;
the ports and terminals.&#13;
1.11   Multimodal Transport. The rapid evolution and expansion of intra- and inter-regional trade,&#13;
fostered by regional trade bloc initiatives and by agricultural expansion and industrial development in the&#13;
interior of Brazil, will require important changes in the national and international transport systems.&#13;
Freight carriers will be required to provide efficient and comprehensive logistical services to agricultural,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
industrial and commercial shippers, and for this purpose they will have to seek innovative multimodal&#13;
transport solutions which maximize productivity and quality of service. This in turn will require a much&#13;
better integration of the transport systems, particularly railroads and ports, which represent the major&#13;
bottlenecks in the present transport system. The restructuring and privatization of railroads and port&#13;
terminals, if adequately completed, is expected to resolve the bulk of the intra- and intermodal bottlenecks.&#13;
D. The Road Transport Industry&#13;
1.12   Road Freight Transport Industry. The country's 15,000 commercial trucking firms together&#13;
own about 25 percent of the truck fleet, and truck owner-operators operate another 25 percent of the fleet.&#13;
Own-account trucking therefore represents the remaining half of the truck fleet. Trucking firms are highly&#13;
specialized as to the type of market served and service provided, including routes and products. Larger&#13;
firms concentrate their services on denser routes, while smaller firms appear more frequently in less dense&#13;
or more specialized links. Owner-operators generally operate older, medium-size trucks with conventional&#13;
open bodies, on medium and long-distance hauls. Own-account trucking is most important in pick-up and&#13;
delivery services in the cities, and in the inter-city transport of cargoes which require specialized equipment.&#13;
1.13   The trucking industry overall is efficient. Truck rates reveal a competitive position in relation to&#13;
rail transport. The share of operational expenses to revenues varies from 50 percent to 70 percent, and&#13;
total expenses are about 90 percent of revenues.  There is no evidence of above-normal profits.&#13;
Investments, however, have tended to decline in relation to GNP since the mid-1970s. Medium-size trucks&#13;
have been substituted for smaller trucks and pick-ups in urban services, and for heavier trucks in inter-city&#13;
services. The number of owner-operators has been decreasing gradually since the 1970s and their fleet is&#13;
rapidly aging.&#13;
1.14   The trucking industry is largely unregulated. The role of the Government has essentially been to&#13;
provide and maintain the road infrastructure. The Government influenced operations only indirectly&#13;
through pricing and taxation of inputs, and license fees. In 1983 a law was passed authonrzing the&#13;
Government to regulate the industry, and some important restrictions were introduced. But insufficient&#13;
political support and means of enforcing legislation have made the impact of these restrictions negligible.&#13;
In 1990, the Government revoked all these restrictions.&#13;
1.15   Road Passenger Transport Industry. Passenger transportation in Brazil is considered to be a&#13;
public service. Entry into the sector is regulated by government through licenses or concessions. Federal,&#13;
State, and municipal governments set rates, routes, frequencies, and safety and quality standards in&#13;
practically all market segments. There are a few publicly-owned and operated firms in some of the largest&#13;
cities. Private enterprises, however, are predominant in number and hold the largest share of the market.&#13;
The majority of these firms are small to medium in size, and controlled by one entrepreneur or by a family&#13;
group. In the interstate segment and in dense inter-municipal connections, however, there are a few firms&#13;
providing services in complex networks, operating fleets of more than a thousand buses. In the urban&#13;
segment, large firms are rare; they usually serve a strictly defined geographic zone, operating a fleet of up&#13;
to two or three hundred buses from a single garage.&#13;

E. Bank Sector Experience and Strategy&#13;
1.16   The Bank has made 31 loans in the transport sector since the early 1960s: 15 for highways and&#13;
feeder roads, six for railways, two for ports, and eight for urban transportation, in addition to financing&#13;
rural roads under a number of agriculture projects. Until the mid-1970s, the projects concentrated on the&#13;
expansion of the trunk highway network and on the improvement of the railway and mass transit systems.&#13;
In subsequent years, emphasis gradually shifted to the maintenance and rehabilitation of the interstate and&#13;
trunk highway network, to the planning and implementation on a decentralized basis of feeder roads&#13;
programs, to the rehabilitation of important railway corridors, and to the improvement of public bus&#13;
transport and traffic management in the major cities. More recently, the Bank has been supporting the&#13;
rehabilitation and decentralization of urban train systems with four loans, highway rehabilitation,&#13;
maintenance and decentralization with one loan to the Federation and five loans to states, and the&#13;
restructuring and privatization of the federal railways with a recently approved loan.&#13;
1.17   The Bank's involvement in the transport sector has been successful.  The projects' physical&#13;
objectives have generally been met although the more recent difficult economic conditions and related&#13;
funding problems have sometimes caused delays. Progress has been made on policy reforms and&#13;
institutional strengthening though it has taken more time than expected, due to the size and complexity of&#13;
the sector, the large number of government agencies and public enterprises involved, and the difficulty of&#13;
reaching the needed consensus for policy reforms. Under the recently-completed Highway Management&#13;
and Rehabilitation Project (Loan No. 3169-BR), the Federal Government, in consultation with the state&#13;
governments, developed a broad reform and decentralization of the highway administration. The ongoing&#13;
State Highway Management Projects have already achieved substantial progress in re-orienting the&#13;
participating states' highway programs to ensure appropriate priority for maintenance, and in strengthening&#13;
the planning and maintenance management capabilities of the DERs.&#13;
1.18   The assistance of the Bank to the transport sector of Brazil will remain in support of broader&#13;
country objectives, particularly: (a) stabilization and consequent need to contain public expenditures,&#13;
increase revenue mobilization and to improve resource utilization; (b) economic growth, ensuring efficient&#13;
and reliable infrastructure services to targeted growth sectors of the economy; (c) redefinition of the role of&#13;
the state, strengthening its regulatory functions, withdrawing from operations and promoting private sector&#13;
participation in infrastructure; (d) administrative decentralization; and (e) environmental management.&#13;
1.19   Emphasis will be upon the formulation and effective implementation of appropriate transport&#13;
policy and institutional reforms including: (a) restructuring and privatization of railways and ports; (b) re-&#13;
design of sector regulations, establishment of appropriate regulatory agencies, and effective implementation&#13;
of regulatory reform, which, together with efficient pricing mechanisms and privatization measures, aim at&#13;
restoring the role of market forces in the sector; (c) institutional reform, including effective decentralization&#13;
of government responsibilities, seeking an appropriate balance between fiscal revenues and responsibilities,&#13;
strengthening the normative and monitoring functions at the center, and the planning, management and&#13;
environmental control capabilities of the decentralized entities; (d) privatization of operation and&#13;
maintenance services through concessions and management contracts; and (e) public investment&#13;
programming and private sector investment promotion based on appropriate economic, environmental and&#13;
project finance analyses, aiming in particular at facilitating intra- and inter-regional trade flows.&#13;

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. Subsector Overview&#13;
2.01   Brazil's road network has a total length of about&#13;
1.7 million km.  The network is classified into three   Table 2.1: Brazil's Road Networks (Thousand Kn.)&#13;
administrative levels: (a) a federal network, currently  Jurisdiction    Paved  Unpaved    Total&#13;
about 67,500 km, which is under federal jurisdiction   Federal      52         15        67&#13;
(section B); (b) state networks, totaling about 200,000&#13;
kmn, which are under the jurisdictions of the 26 states,  State     85        114        199&#13;
two federal territories and the Federal District (section   Municipal  15     1,376     1,391&#13;
C); and (c) municipal networks extending over some 1.4  Total       152       1,505     1,657&#13;
million km, which fall under the jurisdictions of over&#13;
4,000 Municipalities (Table 3, Annex 10).&#13;
2.02   The financing of the highway subsector underwent substantial changes over the last decade. Road&#13;
expenditures used to be funded mainly through revenues from road user taxes, which were shared between&#13;
the three levels of government and earmarked for that purpose. In the 1980s, however, tax earmarking was&#13;
gradually discontinued. Also, the 1988 constitutional and fiscal reforms have transferred the bulk of road&#13;
user tax revenues to the states and municipalities, but the distribution of road expenditure responsibilities&#13;
remained unchanged (section D). The reform has affected the ability of the Federation to rehabilitate and&#13;
maintain an extensive federal highway network and to finance needed capacity investments. In order to&#13;
correct the imbalance between revenue and expenditure responsibilities, the Government has decided to: (a)&#13;
decentralize responsibilities for highways which are not clearly of national interest to state jurisdictions&#13;
(section E); (b) transfer responsibilities for operation and maintenance of high-traffic highways and, where&#13;
feasible, new capacity investments to private concessionaires who would recover costs through tolls&#13;
(section F); and (c) implement appropriate policies and mechanisms to ensure adequate financing for public&#13;
road expenditures (section D).&#13;
2.03   Highway administration responsibilities are shared between the National Roads Department&#13;
(DNER), the 27 state road departments (DERs), and the 4,000 or so municipalities. DNER and many of&#13;
the DERs developed into large organizations to administer the extensive construction programs of the&#13;
previous decades. There are still substantial needs for building new roads, in particular in the Center-West&#13;
Region, and for capacity investments in the South and Southeast regions. However, since large portions of&#13;
the networks are now reaching a critical age, highway maintenance has or should become the main activity&#13;
of most agencies. Therefore, the agencies have to make important institutional adjustments, in particular to&#13;
develop appropriate road maintenance planning and management systems, to rely more systematically on&#13;
the more efficient private contractor industry rather than force account for their routine maintenance&#13;
activities, to develop and supervise highway concessions, and to strengthen environmental management.&#13;
DNER and some DERs have already undertaken such reforms under ongoing Bank-financed projects. But&#13;
there are significant technological and institutional gaps among the various agencies (sections G &amp; H).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

B. The Federal Highway Network&#13;
2.04   Brazil's federal highway network has a total                                    ---&#13;
length of approximately 67,500 centerline km, of which          Fig 2.1 Paving Works&#13;
52,500 km (or 78%) are paved and about 15,000 km (or   E 60,000&#13;
22%) are unpaved. It represents a total asset of nearly  Xd 50.000&#13;
US$12 billion equivalent. It carries most of the country's  f  40,000&#13;
long distance traffic.  Road users annually spend an   s  30,000&#13;
amount equivalent to almost twice its replacement value      20,000-&#13;
for operating their vehicles on this network. About 90%  X    10:-0&#13;
of the paved network consists of flexible structures with   E&#13;
granular base-course overlaid either by asphaltic concrete  0 0&#13;
1960   1970   1980  1990   2000&#13;
carpets or by double-surface dressings in the proportion                 Year&#13;
of 74% to 26%. Rigid or cement-concrete pavements&#13;
represent less than 1% of the paved network. Most paving works occurred between 1955 and 1985 at a&#13;
rate averaging 1500 km per year (Fig 2.1). Between 1985 and 1995, about 5000 km only were paved. The&#13;
network is mostly unpaved in the northern and northeastern regions, particularly in the states of Para,&#13;
Amazonia and Roraima. In the other regions, the federal network is fairly evenly distributed by surface&#13;
type (Table 4, Annex 10).&#13;
2.05   Traffic volumes on the paved network cover a    Fig 2.2 Traffic Distribution on the Federal&#13;
wide range, from less than 1,000 vehicles up to 20,000            Network (1986)&#13;
to 40,000 vehicles per day on the most heavily trafficked  16000&#13;
dual carriageway sections (Fig 2.2). Average annual    14000 t&#13;
daily traffic volumes on two-lane rural highways    1000 &#13;
generally range between 1,000 and 5,000 vehicles per  8000&#13;
day, with the highest densities occurring in the southern  6000  sJ&#13;
states.  Over the last 10 years, the average traffic '       -&#13;
2000 &#13;
volume has increased at about 3.0% per year; the mean   o            *              .  3.-&#13;
daily traffic rose steadily from about 1600 vehicles per    o        6 g  O    o, 6 o    : °°&#13;
day in 1985 to about 2,100 vehicles per day currently.      e&#13;
On  the  unpaved  network, traffic  volumes  are                 Average Daily Traffic  A&#13;
considerably lower and seldom exceed 1,000 vehicles&#13;
per day. About one third of the network (5,000 km), however, would be eligible for upgrading and paving&#13;
as it presently carries more than 250 vehicles per day. The typical traffic composition on the federal&#13;
network is 51% light vehicles and 49% commercial vehicles. Axle-load measurements carried out in 1994&#13;
on a representative sample of the network indicate that at least 10% of the trucks are overloaded, with&#13;
single axle weight exceeding the 10-ton maximum legal limit, typically ranging between 11 tons and 15&#13;
tons. However, an economic analysis of overloading confirmed by world-wide experience shows that&#13;
economic gains from overloading generally exceed economic maintenance costs (Annex 7, paras. 35-39).&#13;
2.06   For many years, particularly between 1975 and 1990, the maintenance condition of the paved&#13;
network remained poor as the funds made available to DNER only allowed to start addressing the severe&#13;
maintenance backlog accumulated during the previous two decades. The proportion of the network in poor&#13;
condition remained persistently in the vicinity of 30% (Fig. 2.4). Between 1978 and 1996 some 27,000 km&#13;
have been resurfaced or strengthened at a total present cost of about US$6.5 billion (Fig. 2.3). As a&#13;
consequence, the condition has improved and the proportion of the network length in poor condition (as&#13;
measured by a roughness index, IRI, higher than five) fell to about 20% in 1992 and to about 11% in early&#13;
1996 (Table 2.2 and Fig 2.4). The proportion of weak pavements with average deflection values higher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
than 0.5 mm to 0.6 mm (i.e., with modified structural number less than 4) was also in the order of 10% in&#13;
early 1996, as compared to about 50% between 1987 and 1990.&#13;

C. The State Road Networks&#13;
2.07    The road networks which are under the jurisdictions of the states of the Federation have a total&#13;
length of approximately 200,000 km, of which 85,000 km (or 43%) are paved, and about 115,000 km (or&#13;
57%) are gravel or earth roads. These networks include "transitory" roads (about 25,000 km of which&#13;
14,000 km are paved), which were considered eligible to become federal (Table 5, Annex 10). The length&#13;
of the state road networks is about only three times the length of the federal highway network in every state,&#13;
with the exception of the northern region where the density of state roads is extremely low (0.3 km per 100&#13;
sq. km) because of the environmental conditions and low population in Amazonia. Many highway sections&#13;
which are not of national but of regional or local interest have been built in the past by the Federal&#13;
Government and have remained under federal jurisdiction. The decentralization component of the project&#13;
would help the Government to transfer these federal highways to the states (paras. 3.05-3.06).&#13;
2.08    Traffic on the state roads is generally smaller than on federal highways. It varies widely across&#13;
states, reflecting sharp differences between levels of income and development. For example, on the paved&#13;
network, average daily traffic (ADT) ranges from 500 to 5,000 vehicles per day in the southeastern region&#13;
and from 50 to 500 vehicle per day in the northern region (Table 2.3 hereafter). On the unpaved network,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
the ADT is generally below 100 vehicles per&#13;
day in the northern part of the country, but  Table 2.3 Traffie volumes on the paved state network (1992-1994)&#13;
may reach or exceed 200 vehicles per day in   Region           Normal ranee of ADT   Mean ADT value&#13;

. .   .       .            ~~~~~~~Center West      200-1500           600&#13;
composition on state highways is generally&#13;
evenly shared between light and commercial  South                  400-2,500          1000&#13;
vehicles. Overloading above the maximum    South East (Sao Paulo)  500-5000           2000&#13;
legal single axle load of 10 tons is also&#13;
frequent.&#13;
2.09   With the exception of the most heavily trafficked roads in the southern states, where pavement&#13;
structure and geometry are often similar to the federal highway standards (relatively thick asphalt concrete&#13;
wearing courses), the structural capacity of the state roads has been designed in accordance with the low&#13;
traffic volumes. Pavements are of the flexible type, consisting of naturally-occurring gravel base-course&#13;
covered with surface designs or thin bituminous mixtures (3 to 4 cm of asphaltic concrete or sand-asphalt&#13;
carpets) with structural numbers generally below 4.&#13;
2.10    Comprehensive and accurate information on the maintenance condition for the entire state road&#13;
networks is not available. However, a survey carried out in 1995 has provided data from an array of 14&#13;
states which covers the five regions of the country. Overall, the surface condition of the state networks is&#13;
somewhat worse than the present condition of the federal network. About 18% of the length of the paved&#13;
network is now in critical or poor condition. In addition, nearly 50% is more than 10 years old, thus&#13;
approaching the end of its service life. Therefore, efficient rehabilitation and resurfacing programs are now&#13;
urgently required on the state networks, in order to prevent the proportion of roads in poor condition from&#13;
reaching the level observed on the federal network throughout the 1980's. The ongoing Bank-financed&#13;
state highway management projects are addressing this issue in six states.&#13;
D. Highway Subsector Financing&#13;
2.11   Road User Charges. The system of road user taxes underwent substantial changes with the&#13;
constitutional and fiscal reforms of 1988. The federal level lost its power to impose taxes on petroleum and&#13;
alcohol products and on motor-vehicle ownership, retaining only a petroleum import tax (IIP). The states&#13;
gained from the inclusion of petroleum and alcohol products and of inter-state and inter-municipal transport&#13;
services in the base of the value added tax (ICMS) and the right to tax motor-vehicle ownership. The&#13;
municipal level increased its participation in revenues from the ICMS (from 20% to 25%) and from the&#13;
motor-vehicle ownership tax (IPVA, from 40% to 50%); and they gained authority to impose a tax on sales&#13;
of gasoline and alcohol (IWC). A summary of current charges is shown in Table 6, Annex 10.&#13;
2.12   The ICMS imposed on petroleum and alcohol products has resulted in a net increase in tax&#13;
revenues and in an improved structure of road user taxes, as compared to the previous tax, which was&#13;
levied at a reduced rate on diesel oil and from which alcohol was exempted. But the distribution of&#13;
revenues among the three administrative levels has been adversely affected, and is no longer consistent with&#13;
the distribution of responsibilities. States and municipalities now recover the total costs of operation,&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation of their road networks, as well as a substantial portion of their road&#13;
upgrading and construction expenditures (Table 6, Annex 10). Some state and municipal governments, in&#13;
particular in the south and the southeast regions, where road traffic is higher, recover more than their total&#13;
road expenditures. On the other hand, the Federation has lost all fiscal revenues from road users, with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
exception of the portion of the petroleum import tax revenues paid by road users. A policy for road cost-&#13;
recovery was developed under the Highways Management and Rehabilitation Project (Loan no. 3169-BR).&#13;
The Federal Government's decentralization and concession programs are aimed at correcting this imbalance&#13;
between highway expenditures and revenues at the federal and state levels (see sections E &amp; F).&#13;
2.13   The prices of motor-vehicle fuels at the pump, in the first quarter of 1997, were about US$0.79&#13;
and US$0.44 equivalent per liter of gasoline (which includes up to 20% of ethanol) and of diesel-oil&#13;
respectively. These prices have been consistently maintained well above international prices, including the&#13;
necessary adjustments for taxes, distribution costs and retailers' margins.&#13;
2.14   Road expenditures used to be funded mainly through revenues from road user taxes, which were&#13;
shared between the three levels of government and earmarked for that purpose. In the early 1980s,&#13;
however, tax earmarking was gradually discontinued with a view to restoring central control over public&#13;
expenditures. The road agencies have consequently seen their resources erode drastically since general&#13;
budget allocations did not make up for the loss of earmarked funds. Their total reliance upon the less&#13;
predictable transfers from general revenue has badly affected their construction and maintenance programs.&#13;
Federal and state road expenditures are now funded from general revenue. The project would assist DNER&#13;
and DERs in: (a) concessioning high-traffic highways to ensure reliable funding from road users (para.&#13;
3.07); and (b) preparing road programs based on sound technical and economic prionty criteria, and to&#13;
ensure adequate funding for their rehabilitation and maintenance programs (para. 3.09).&#13;
E. The Federal Highway Decentralization Program&#13;
2.15   In order to correct the imbalance between highway revenue and expenditure responsibilities at the&#13;
federal and state levels, the Federal Government has decided to reclassify the highway network, only&#13;
maintaining under federal jurisdiction the main inter-regional and interstate highways of national interest,&#13;
and transferring to state jurisdictions highways which are predominantly of local interest. The Government&#13;
has defined the highways of national interest to remain under federal jurisdictions as those which:&#13;
(a) connect the states' capitals; (b) link with other major modes of transport to provide inter-regional&#13;
connections; (d) promote international connections; and (d) ensure or fulfill national defense or safety&#13;
purposes. The federal and the state administrations have completed the negotiations regarding the proposed&#13;
reclassification. The resulting highway network which would remain under federal jurisdiction would&#13;
comprise about 50,000 km, of which 40,000 km are paved and 10,000 km are unpaved highways,&#13;
essentially located in Amazonia. The other highways, which would be transferred to 18 state jurisdictions,&#13;
represent some 17,500 km, of which 12,500 km are paved and 5,000 km are unpaved (Annex 3, Table 1).&#13;
Draft legislation (Sistema Nacional de Via,do) is being reviewed by the Congress in order to formalize the&#13;
proposed reclassification and decentralization. The decentralization program is described in Annex 3.&#13;
2.16   Three states (Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, Parana) would assume over 50 percent of the total&#13;
length of the highways to be transferred (Table 1, Annex 3). The transfers would represent an increase of&#13;
about 25 percent of current network responsibilities for Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, and 13&#13;
percent for Parana. In order to alleviate the impact of such transfers on the states' finances, the state&#13;
governments have prepared and undertaken plans to concession a significant portion of the highways to be&#13;
transferred, together with highways which will remain under federal jurisdiction and state highways&#13;
(Section F). The Federal Goverment has recently delegated these highways to the states in order to enable&#13;
them to invite bids for concessions. In the other states, the increases of the states' network responsibilities&#13;
remain below 15 percent and/or represent a small length (Table 1, Annex 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
2.17   The Federal and the state governments have agreed, in order to minimize the impact of the transfers&#13;
on the states' expenditure responsibilities, that highways would be transferred in good condition or that the&#13;
Federal Government would provide the resources necessary to rehabilitate those in poor condition. The&#13;
Ministry of Transport has negotiated highway decentralization agreements with the 18 participating states&#13;
in order to specify the highway sections to be transferred, and the respective responsibilities of the Federal&#13;
and state governments for the execution and financing of the rehabilitation works and for operation and&#13;
maintenance until the above-mentioned legislation is passed by the Congress. Decentralization agreements&#13;
have already been signed with the states of Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, Parana and Bahia. DNER&#13;
has negotiated and would enter into delegation agreements with the DERs in the seven states of Minas&#13;
Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, Parana, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Goias and Ceara, in order to delegate the&#13;
execution of the rehabilitation works within agreed technical and financial parameters. These seven states&#13;
were selected on the basis of the size of the rehabilitation program in the state and the capacity of the DER&#13;
to implement it. The proposed project would assist the federal and the state governments in effectively&#13;
implementing such agreements (paras. 3.05 and 3.06).&#13;
F. The Highway Concession Program&#13;
2.18   In February 1995, the Congress passed a revised Concession Law which allows the Government to&#13;
transfer highways, as well as other public facilities and services, to private concessionaires. In September&#13;
1996, the Congress passed another law (the Delegation Law) to authorize the Federal Government to&#13;
delegate federal highways and other public infrastructure facilities to states and municipalities for their&#13;
subsequent concessioning. On the basis of these laws, the Federal Government and some state governments&#13;
have started developing and implementing highway concession programs, with a view to increasing road&#13;
cost recovery and to improving highway management. Private concessionaires would operate, rehabilitate&#13;
and maintain the highways, and, in some cases, carry out and finance investments, and would recover these&#13;
costs from road users through tolls. The governments or highway agencies remain responsible for&#13;
identifying candidate highways, defining initial works and maintenance standards, calling for bids and&#13;
evaluating proposals from prequalified investors, as well as for supervising the concession contracts.&#13;
2.19   DNER has prepared a concession program which would consist of transferring high-traffic federal&#13;
highways totaling about 10,000 km to private operators over the next four years. However, a number of&#13;
states, including Rio Grande do Sul, Parana, Santa Catarina and Minas Gerais have also prepared highway&#13;
concessions programs which would include both federal and state highways. The Ministry of Transport, in&#13;
line with the Government's decentralization objective and on the basis of the recent Delegation Law, has&#13;
delegated federal highway sections totaling about 5,000 km to the first three states for concessioning.&#13;
Negotiations are underway with the state of Minas Gerais for further delegations. DNER will be&#13;
responsible for concessioning the remaining highway sections included in the program, and for monitoring&#13;
the concessioning of the delegated highways (Annex 4).&#13;
2.20   DNER has completed a first phase of the program, which consisted of concessioning five highway&#13;
sections totaling about 850 km, including the Niteroi Bridge, the Dutra (Rio de Janeiro - Sao Paulo)&#13;
highway, the Porto-Alegre-Entrada Guaiba highway, the Alem Paraiba-Teresopolis highway, and the Juiz&#13;
de Fora-Petropolis-Rio de Janeiro highway, which had already been tolled in the past. The total&#13;
investments required on these five sections are estimated at about US$1.4 billion equivalent over the&#13;
concession period (Annex 4). This first phase of the program suffered delays due to litigation by&#13;
unsuccessful bidders and to the unavailability of long-term private debt finance in Brazil, but the&#13;
concessions are now in operation. Since concessionaires have been unable to secure private debt financing,&#13;
except for a relatively small IFC "B" loan currently being finalized for the Dutra highway, the National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Bank for Social and Economic Development (BNDES) had to provide most of the necessary debt financing.&#13;
Also for this reason, the Government decided to dualize two important highways (Belo Horizonte - Sao&#13;
Paulo and Sao Paulo - Curitiba - Florianopolis) with public funds and borrowings from the IDB, for&#13;
subsequent concessioning to private operators.&#13;
2.21   The experience developed under the first phase is being incorporated into the subsequent phases of&#13;
the program, including with regard to the sharing of various risks. In particular, improved mechanisms&#13;
have been developed and guarantees would be offered for toll adjustments with inflation, servicing of&#13;
foreign debts, repatriation of dividends, and non-judicial resolution of disputes. DNER is also preparing&#13;
for a broader dissemination of the program, with a view to attracting interest from international investors&#13;
and financiers, and to increasing competition. The Government has also shown interest in the Bank's&#13;
guarantee program, and it was agreed that, at the request of the Government, the Bank would assess the&#13;
feasibility of partial risk guarantees on loans to concessionaires for specific highway concessions.&#13;
2.22   In order to implement the highway concession program and to supervise the highway concessions,&#13;
DNER has recently established a Concession Department, headed by a Director who reports directly to the&#13;
Director-General (Chart 1, Annex 10). The department is responsible for all activities related to highway&#13;
concessions, including planning, studies, development, procurement and supervision. The supervision of&#13;
the concession contracts would be delegated to DNER's relevant districts. The proposed project would&#13;
include technical assistance and staff training to help organize and strengthen the new Concession&#13;
Department and establish adequate concession supervision capabilities in the relevant DNER districts in&#13;
order to implement the concession program efficiently (para. 3.08 and Annex 4).&#13;
G. Highway Budgets, Policies and Programs&#13;
2.23    With the elimination of the road fund and the fiscal reform, DNER's annual budgets decreased&#13;
sharply during the 1980s. Expressed in 1996 dollar value, its annual resources fell from about US$3.5&#13;
billion in 1980 to about US$1.5 billion in 1990. Over the last five years, they ranged between US$850&#13;
million and US$1.7 billion, averaging about US$1.2 billion (Table 7, Annex 10). Of this total annual&#13;
allocation, about US$400 million are spent on wages and other current expenditures, and US$160 million&#13;
on debt service. During the 1980s, expenditures on new construction and capacity investments were&#13;
drastically reduced from US$720 million in 1980 to US$290 million in 1990, and to about US$150 million&#13;
in 1992-96, but have more recently increased to a level of about US$300 million per year, with the IDB-&#13;
financed dualization works. During the 1980s, the average annual expenditure incurred for rehabilitation&#13;
only (in 1996 dollar value) was in the order US$350 million representing about 36% of total road&#13;
expenditures, and was reduced to about US$315 million over the last six years still representing about 62%&#13;
of total road expenditures. Resource allocation for routine maintenance averaged about US$300 million&#13;
per year between 1978 and 1985 representing 22% of total road expenditure and then fell to about US$100&#13;
million over the last 10 years with a particularly bad period between 1989 and 1992 when they were&#13;
drastically reduced to record low values between US$30 and 80 million per year (1996 dollar value). On&#13;
average, over the years, routine maintenance has represented about 18% of total road expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.24   DNER analyzed alternative network rehabilitation    Expenditures in New Const &amp; Paving&#13;
and maintenance policies under budget constraints using the&#13;
HDM-III and EBM  models. The analysis indicates that   " 600&#13;
annual rehabilitation budgets of less than US$200 million   ' 500&#13;
would lead to the further deterioration of the current federal   = 400-&#13;
network, bringing the proportion in poor condition to about  300 -&#13;
30% , thus validating the historical evidence mentioned in  e5 200&#13;
para. 2.06 (Annexes 2 and 7). The optimum rehabilitation    a-&#13;
and maintenance policies, assuming no decentralization or   , 100&#13;
concessions, would require annual budgets of about           0            1        1&#13;
US$300-350  million  for  rehabilitation  and  periodic       1975  1980  19Yar 1990  1995  2000&#13;
maintenance and about US$100 million for routine&#13;
maintenance over the next four years (Annex 2). Such&#13;
policies would maximize economic benefits and keep the             DNER Annual Resources&#13;
proportion of pavements in poor condition to below 5%.   2 4,000&#13;
The optimum policies for enhancing the capacity and level   m 3,500&#13;
of service of high-traffic highways would require about        3,000&#13;
US$500 million over the next five years, excluding the   _ 2,500&#13;
a~2,000&#13;
network intended for concessions.                        &gt; 1500&#13;
1,000&#13;
2.25   In line with its current efforts to contain public   z   500 -&#13;
expenditures, the Federal Government has decided to select          .&#13;
a  policy  which  would  limit  annual  budgets  for           1975  1980  1985  1990  1995 2000&#13;
rehabilitation, maintenance and operational improvements&#13;
to about US$350 million. Compared to the optimum policy&#13;
which calls for total rehabilitation expenditures of about      Expenditures in Rehabilitation&#13;
US$1.6 billion over four years, the selected policy requires   E&#13;
total rehabilitation expenditures of US$900 million over   -  500&#13;
four to five years. The Net Present Value (NPV) of the   O  400&#13;
selected program is still equal to 90% of the NPV of the   T&#13;
optimum program. The selected strategy will effectively   @ 300&#13;
preserve the federal highway network, including the         200&#13;
highways to be transferred to the states. It will reduce the  1&#13;
proportion of pavements in poor condition to less than 2%   In&#13;
over the next five years. The selected policies are described  0     I-  1 &#13;
1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005&#13;
in Annex 2, together with their expected impacts.                          Year&#13;
2.26   The DERs' annual budgets have also decreased    Expenditures in Routine Maintenance&#13;
during the 1980s, with the elimination of the road fund, to&#13;
an aggregate amount of about US$1.0 billion in 1989. In    E 300&#13;
the 1990s, after the fiscal reform which transferred road    , 250 --&#13;
user charges to states and municipalities, they gradually    O 200&#13;
increased to the level of about US$1.5 billion in 1995.     1&#13;
Many state governments, especially in regions in which the&#13;
highway networks are less developed, have continued to      1&#13;
give priority to new construction or paving projects, at the  5-  -&#13;
expense of maintenance or rehabilitation  of existing    X o 0_&#13;
highways. Portions of these networks are now entering into    1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005&#13;
a process of rapid deterioration. However, a number of                    Year&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
state governments are already giving more attention to the maintenance of the state highway networks, and&#13;
are establishing effective maintenance planning and management systems under Bank-financed state&#13;
highway management projects.&#13;
H. Highway Planning and Management Capacities&#13;
2.27   DNER's organization still reflects its past objective of expanding the federal highway network. Its&#13;
chronic funding problems have gradually weakened its capacity to plan and manage an extensive highway&#13;
network effectively. As in most other Government agencies, the lack of clear goals and of management&#13;
autonomy, and continuity, as well as inadequate staff compensation, management and development&#13;
policies, have resulted in low staff motivation and accountability, and in inadequate performance. The&#13;
proposed decentralization and concession programs are expected to reduce DNER's operational&#13;
responsibilities, but DNER will continue to be responsible for the management of a substantial federal&#13;
network, and will need a capacity to develop and supervise of highway concessions. Under the Highway&#13;
Management and Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3169-BR), the Ministry of Transport and DNER have&#13;
initiated actions to reorganize the agency. The Concession Department was established. Also, DNER's&#13;
Administrative Council was recently reformed, with representatives from the Ministries of Planning,&#13;
Finance and Transport replacing DNER Department Directors, and with a clear mandate to reorganize&#13;
DNER in line with its reduced operational responsibilities resulting from decentralization, concessions, and&#13;
maintenance management contracts. The proposed project would provide technical assistance and staff&#13;
training to help DNER prepare a strategic plan and carry out its reorganization and staff development&#13;
program (para. 3.1 0).&#13;
2.28   DNER's Planning Division is responsible for expenditure planning and progranmming on the federal&#13;
highway network. With technical assistance and training of staff financed under the recently-completed&#13;
Highway Management and Rehabilitation Project (Loan No. 3169-BR), the division reactivated DNER's&#13;
pavement management system which was created in the early 1980s, updated the road network database,&#13;
and developed efficient network maintenance and investment strategies and programs on the basis of&#13;
analyses carried out with the Bank-developed Highway Design and Maintenance Standards (HDM-III)&#13;
Model and the Expenditure Budgeting Model (EBM) (Annex 2). Also, a bridge management system was&#13;
developed under the same project, and is being implemented in order to effectively monitor and plan for the&#13;
maintenance of about 5,000 bridges on the federal network. With these new tools and trained staff, the&#13;
Planning Division is now capable of effectively carrying out its planning and programming responsibilities.&#13;
However, a number of institutional weaknesses still need to be addressed to ensure the effective&#13;
implementation of the programs, in particular: (a) the lack of coordination among the various departments&#13;
(Planning, Engineering, Operations, and Concessions); (b) the limited capacity of the Engineering&#13;
Department to contract and effectively supervise the detailed engineering studies and the preparation of the&#13;
tender documents in order to ensure their consistency with the policies based on the HDM/EBM analyses of&#13;
the Planning Division; and (c) the insufficient technical capacity of the Engineering Department to contract&#13;
the supervision works and to effectively exercise its quality control and technical audit functions. In order&#13;
to address these issues, DNER has recently established a Coordinating Committee, strengthened the studies&#13;
and supervision divisions of the Engineering Department, improved the forms of engineering and&#13;
supervision contracts, established a central audit group, and started to implement a computerized project&#13;
management system. The proposed project will provide technical assistance and staff training to ensure the&#13;
effective implementation of the program (para. 3 .10).&#13;
2.29   DNER has a long tradition of contracting out capital works and maintenance operations to private&#13;
contractors. Little work, if any, is now being carried out by force account. With the exception of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
highways delegated to the DERs (about 8,000 km), the rest of the paved network (about 80% in length) is&#13;
currently maintained through private contractors under input and unit price form of contracts (Annex 2,&#13;
section H). This policy has enabled DNER to substantially improve the results of its maintenance&#13;
programs as compared to previous force account operations. But the complexity of these contracts, which&#13;
involve many items of works in small quantities, and the insufficient capacity of DNER to effectively&#13;
supervise such contracts and control the quantity and quality of the works on site, have led to numerous&#13;
contract modifications and price increases. In order to reduce this administrative burden and to improve&#13;
the efficiency of its routine maintenance operations, DNER management recently decided to experiment&#13;
with performance-based maintenance management contracts. DNER is now procuring such pilot contracts&#13;
in each of the regions. On the basis of the results of the pilot contracts, DNER will prepare a plan to&#13;
gradually increase the use of such form of contract. The project will provide technical assistance and&#13;
training of staff to monitor the pilot contracts, develop a performance-based maintenance management&#13;
program, and effectively implement and monitor such program (para. 3.10).&#13;
I. Environmental Management&#13;
2.30   Brazil has appropriate environmental protection legislation. In particular, any major civil works&#13;
project is subject to an environmental impact assessment to measure its effects on the inhabitants and on&#13;
the natural environment in the project area. For investments likely to have negative impacts, funds should&#13;
be included to mitigate any adverse effects. Under the Highways Management and Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(Loan 3169-BR), the Federal Government and DNER have prepared environmental standards and&#13;
guidelines for the transport sector in general and for the highway subsector in particular; and they have&#13;
strengthened their capabilities for implementing and for monitoring compliance with these standards. In&#13;
particular, DNER's environmental unit is staffed with one economist and three highway engineers, who&#13;
have received appropriate training. With technical assistance, the unit has developed a manual of&#13;
environmental norms and instructions (the Environmental Manual, EM) which, after approval by DNER's&#13;
Administrative Council, has been put into effect. The unit has established a computerized environmental&#13;
management system, and effectively supervised a number of environmental studies carried out by&#13;
consultants (Annex 5). It has also developed a methodology to assess environmental degradations along&#13;
existing highways, and to incorporate the necessary corrective designs and solutions into highway&#13;
rehabilitation engineering and works contracts.&#13;
2.31   The environmental management performance of the DERs is still mixed. Many DERs do not have&#13;
yet appropriate environmental norms or guidelines nor a capacity to implement them. But the seven DERs&#13;
participating in the project, which have benefited from Bank or IDB-financed projects, have already&#13;
established an institutional capacity to analyze the environmental impacts of their projects, take them into&#13;
account at the planning and design stages, and to effectively implement the necessary prevention or&#13;
mitigatory measures. Under the project, they will be required to adopt DNER's EM or equivalent, and to&#13;
strengthen their environmental units and procedures as necessary to effectively supervise the&#13;
implementation of the EM. The terms of the contracts for highway engineering, road works and concessions&#13;
would specify the environmental responsibilities of the consultants, contractors, concessionaires and DNER&#13;
or the DER, with appropriate references to the EM. The environmental units of DNER and the DERs, and&#13;
the Project Management Consultant would carry out appropriate supervision. In particular, the project&#13;
would help implement the necessary surveys, designs and works under the rehabilitation subprojects to&#13;
repair and prevent road-related environmental degradation (para. 3.15 and Annex 5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives, Origin and Rationale&#13;
3.01   Project Origin. The project's concept originated from three main factors: (a) Brazil's broad&#13;
decentralization and privatization objectives which were formalized in the 1988 Constitution, and the recent&#13;
regulation of public service concessions (Concession Law); (b) the Government's inability to adequately&#13;
fund the maintenance of the highway network under federal jurisdiction and the consequent funding&#13;
difficulties experienced under the recently-completed Highway Management and Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(Loan No. 3169-BR); and (c) the experience gained with strengthening the maintenance capacity of state&#13;
highway agencies under several state highway management projects. Following the transfer of road user&#13;
tax revenues from the federation to the states and municipalities, many states had to assume de facto&#13;
responsibilities, on a case by case basis, for essential works on federal highways which could not be funded&#13;
from the federal budget. But it became clear that in order to permit effective maintenance, management&#13;
and financing of the main highway network, the latter had to be reclassified, and highways had to be&#13;
transferred to state jurisdictions so as to correct or to alleviate the existing imbalance between revenue and&#13;
expenditure responsibilities. State govermnents agreed to assume responsibilities for certain highways on&#13;
the condition that they would be transferred in good condition or with the funds necessary for their&#13;
rehabilitation. On this basis, the Federal Government presented a draft law to the Congress (Sistema&#13;
Nacional de Via,do, SNT) to reclassify the national transport system, including the highway network. It&#13;
also negotiated agreements with the state governments to transfer responsibilities and to implement and&#13;
finance the necessary rehabilitation works. At the same time, the Federal Government and some state&#13;
governments developed programs to concession high-traffic highways.&#13;
3.02   Project Objectives. The project' s main objective is to improve and maintain the serviceability of&#13;
the main highway network on a sustainable basis, with a view to reducing road transport costs. Specific&#13;
objectives are to:&#13;
(a) rehabilitate federal highways;&#13;
(b) decentralize highway responsibilities to state governments;&#13;
(c) increase the participation of the private sector in the management and financing of highways&#13;
through concessions and maintenance management contracts; and&#13;
(d) strengthen the capabilities of DNER and the DERs to prepare, contract and monitor efficient&#13;
network rehabilitation and maintenance programs and highway concession projects.&#13;
Achievement of these objectives would be measured and monitored during implementation through a set of&#13;
key indicators (para. 4.09 (d) and Annex 8, Table 1). It is expected that the federal and the transferred&#13;
highway networks would be in a satisfactory condition at project completion, and that only routine and&#13;
preventive maintenance would be necessary thereafter.&#13;
3.03   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's country assistance strategy for Brazil, discussed by&#13;
the Board of Executive Directors on June 29, 1995 with an update on June 20, 1996, identifies human&#13;
capital and infrastructure development as the principal bottleneck to Brazil's social and economic&#13;
development. The emphasis is on structural reforms aimed at stabilization and resumption of broad-based&#13;
growth, including the deregulation and privatization of infrastructure services, efficient allocation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
resources in the public sector, and on rebuilding and expanding a deteriorated and insufficient&#13;
infrastructure in partnership with the private sector. The proposed project is fully supportive of this&#13;
assistance strategy. By helping decentralize highway responsibilities, concession high-traffic highways to&#13;
private operators, and eliminate the maintenance backlog, the project will contribute to reducing the&#13;
financial burden on public sector finances, and to achieving a better balance between revenues and&#13;
expenditures at the federal and state levels. By helping implement efficient highway rehabilitation,&#13;
maintenance and operational improvement programs, the project will help reduce the cost of road transport&#13;
and thereby contribute to economic stabilization, to the resumption of growth in agriculture, industry and&#13;
trade, and to increased export competitiveness.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.04   The project would consist of three main components:&#13;
(a) a highway decentralization component, including:&#13;
(i) technical assistance and training services to strengthen the capacity of DNER and the DERs to&#13;
implement:&#13;
(1) decentralization agreements between MT/DNER and each participating state, which would&#13;
specify the highway responsibilities to be transferred to the state, the terms and conditions for such&#13;
transfers, and the agreed actions to strengthen the DER capabilities to prepare and imnplement&#13;
efficient road network maintenance strategies and programns; and&#13;
(2) delegation agreements between DNER and each participating DER, which would specify the&#13;
respective responsibilities for executing the rehabilitation and maintenance works, and the related&#13;
work programs and performance indicators and targets; and&#13;
(ii) state rehabilitation subprojects consisting of: (1) the rehabilitation works on the highways to be&#13;
transferred to each state, as specified in the decentralization and delegation agreements, and&#13;
prepared and executed in accordance with criteria, norms and methodologies specified in an&#13;
Operational Manual (OM); and (2) the related engineering, economic and environmental studies&#13;
and supervision services;&#13;
(b)  a highway concession development component, including:&#13;
(i) technical assistance and training services to strengthen the capacity of the newly-created DNER&#13;
Concession Department and several DER concession units to prepare, promote, supervise and&#13;
monitor highway concessions, and to establish effective regulatory framework and arbitration&#13;
mechanisms; and&#13;
(ii) concession studies consisting of engineering studies, economic and environmental assessments, and&#13;
project finance services for specific highway concession projects;&#13;
(c)   a federal highway component, including:&#13;
(i) technical assistance and training services to strengthen the capacity of DNER to: (1) contract the&#13;
maintenance of an increasing portion of the non-concessioned network through performance-based&#13;
management contracts; (2) prepare a strategic plan, including staffing and training programs, and&#13;
implement a reorganization in line with its reduced operational responsibilities resulting from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
decentralization, concessions and maintenance management contracts; and (3) coordinate and&#13;
monitor the implementation of the entire project;&#13;
(ii) federal rehabilitation subprojects consisting of: (1) rehabilitation works, including resurfacing,&#13;
operational and safety improvement, and environmental rehabilitation works on highways which&#13;
will remain under federal jurisdiction and are not part of the concession program, prepared and&#13;
executed in accordance with criteria, norms and methodologies specified in the OM; and (2) the&#13;
related engineering, economic and environmental studies and supervision services.&#13;
3.05   Highway Decentralization Component. The Government's plan is to transfer highway sections&#13;
totaling about 17,500 km, of which 12,500 km are paved, to state jurisdictions over the next four years&#13;
(Table 1, Annex 3). The main interstate highways and international connections (about 50,000 km, of&#13;
which 40,000 km are paved) would remain under federal jurisdiction. In order to transfer highway&#13;
responsibilities to state jurisdictions, the Federal Government, through MT/DNER, would enter into&#13;
decentralization agreements with state governments, which would specify the highway sections to be&#13;
transferred and the respective responsibilities of DNER and the state for the execution and funding of the&#13;
rehabilitation works and maintenance of these highway sections. Rehabilitation works would be designed&#13;
and implemented in accordance with the catalogue of technical solutions, which was developed and&#13;
optimized with the HDM III and EBM models, and which would be included in the OM (Annex 2).&#13;
Highway sections totaling about 4,000 km would need some rehabilitation works at an estimated total cost&#13;
of about US$225 million equivalent (Table 3.1 hereafter and Table 2, Annex 8). The rehabilitation works&#13;
and the transfer of highway responsibilities would be implemented in accordance with the time schedule and&#13;
monitoring indicators and targets included in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) (Annex 8). Draft&#13;
decentralization agreements have been negotiated with all the participating states and four have already&#13;
been signed. During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on: (a) the draft decentralization agreements;&#13;
(b) the catalogue of technical solutions included in the OM; and (c) the rehabilitation and decentralization&#13;
targets set forth in the PIP (Table 1, Annex 8). The signing of a decentralization agreement with the state,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of disbursement under a state rehabilitation subproject.&#13;
3.06   DNER would delegate the execution of seven state rehabilitation subprojects (Minas Gerais, Rio&#13;
Grande do Sul, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Goias, Bahia and Ceara) to the state DERs, which have adequate&#13;
implementation capabilities, and DNER would carry out supervision and monitoring. These seven states&#13;
combined would assume responsibility for highways totaling about 12,000 km (or 70% of the total length&#13;
to be transferred) (Annex 3, Table 1); and they would rehabilitate sections totaling about 3,500 km (or&#13;
88% of the total length to be rehabilitated). DNER would carry out the remaining works in those states&#13;
which have insufficient capabilities or very few highways to be transferred. The project would include&#13;
technical assistance and training to help state DERs to develop efficient state highway expenditure&#13;
programs based on network surveys and HDM analyses, cost-effective maintenance programs, and&#13;
highway concession projects (Annex 6). Draft delegation agreements have been negotiated with the seven&#13;
above-mentioned states. During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on: (a) the draft delegation&#13;
agreements; (b) DNER to finalize and execute satisfactory delegation agreements with the seven&#13;
participating DERs in accordance with the targets set forth in the PIP, including three delegation&#13;
agreements not later than three months after the effective date of the loan; and (c) the scope of the technical&#13;
assistance and training to the state DERs (Annex 6). The signing of a delegation agreement, satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, would be a condition of disbursement under a delegated state rehabilitation subproject.&#13;
3.07   Highway Concession Development Component. This component would include consultant and&#13;
training services to help: (a) DNER organize and strengthen its new Concession Department, including the&#13;
Department's planning and development, project finance, promotion and marketing, bidding and bid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
evaluation, and concession supervision and monitoring functions; (b) some state DERs prepare and rnonitor&#13;
their concession programs; and (c) DNER carry out technico-economic and financial feasibility studies,&#13;
environmental assessments, engineering designs, and promotion services for specific highway concession&#13;
projects. The specific highway concession projects, which would involve the operation and maintenance of&#13;
existing highways, and possibly rehabilitation and capacity investments (widening and dualization), or new&#13;
construction, would be implemented by DNER and some state DERs separatelv from the proposed project.&#13;
At the request of the Government, the Bank could assess the feasibility of extending partial risk and/or&#13;
credit guarantees to private lenders for highway concession projects which otherwise would not be&#13;
attractive to private investors. In such cases, the Bank would appraise the technical. economic, financial&#13;
and environmental aspects of the specific projects.&#13;
3.08   The Government's objective is to concession federal highways totaling about 10,000 km over the&#13;
next four years, including the already concessioned five sections (about 850 kni) (Table 1, Annex 4). For&#13;
this purpose, the Government has already delegated such federal highway sections totaling about 5,000 km&#13;
to the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Parana and Santa Catarina for concessioning bv the respective state&#13;
DERs. Negotiations are underway with the state of Minas Gerais, which could also lead to such delegation&#13;
agreement. The remaining highways would be concessioned directly by DNER. The rehabilitation works&#13;
needed on the highways to be offered for concession, which are estimated to cost about US$600 million&#13;
equivalent under no budget constraint, have therefore not been included in DNER's public expenditure&#13;
program nor in the project. In the event that some or all these highway concession projects would not&#13;
materialize, DNER has developed and would implement a maintenance contingency plan on such highways.&#13;
The resources necessary for the contingency plan would not exceed US$100 million over 1997-2000.&#13;
Agreement was reached during loan negotiations on: (a) draft terms of reference for the concession&#13;
technical assistance and training; (b) the implementation time schedule, indicators and targets for the&#13;
concession development component (para. 4.09 (b) and Annex 4); and (c) Government guarantee of funds&#13;
for the maintenance contingency plan.&#13;
3.09   Federal Highway Component. On the portion of the highway network which will remain under&#13;
federal jurisdiction and managed by DNER, i.e., which would not be transferred or concessioned (about&#13;
40,000 km), the project would include: (a) rehabilitation or resurfacing works, including environimental&#13;
rehabilitation works, on highway sections of a total length of about 11.000 km over 1997-2001, at an&#13;
estimated total base cost of about US$709 million equivalent; and (b) operational and safetv improvement&#13;
works (including third lane or shoulder widening, improvement of curves and intersections, and&#13;
strengthening or widening of bridges) at an estimated total cost of about US$100 million over 1997-2001&#13;
(Table 3.1 hereafter and Table 2, Annex 8). Operational and safety improvement works, as well as the&#13;
environmental rehabilitation works would be incorporated into the rehabilitation contracts. The 1997-1998&#13;
rehabilitation or resurfacing program totals about 2,650 km and includes operational improvements on&#13;
about 250 km. The engineering designs and economic and environmental analyses for the 1997-1998&#13;
program have been reviewed by the appraisal mission, and found satisfactory (Table 3, Annex 2). The&#13;
Bank would annually review DNER's rehabilitation and maintenance program for the subsequent year,&#13;
including: the federal and state rehabilitation subprojects, which would be prepared in accordance with the&#13;
criteria, standards and methodologies set forth in the OM, and with the indicators and targets set foith in&#13;
the PIP; and all other rehabilitation and maintenance projects, which would be prepared in accordance with&#13;
the catalogue of technical solutions included in the OM. During loan negotiations, agreement was reached&#13;
on: (a) the criteria, standards and methodologies, included in the OM, for the preparation and review of&#13;
DNER's annual rehabilitation and maintenance programs (para. 4.09 (c)); and (b) the implementation time&#13;
schedule, indicators and targets for the federal highway component (para. 4.09 (c) and Arnex 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.10   The technical assistance and training part of the federal highway component would help DNER to:&#13;
(a) prepare and carry out a maintenance management plan, on the basis of the results of several pilot&#13;
performance-based maintenance management contracts, to increase the use of such form of maintenance&#13;
management contracts on the non-concessioned network (Annex 2, section H); (b) prepare a strategic plan&#13;
and carry out the necessary reorganization and staff development program to gradually downsize its&#13;
operations in line with its reduced operational responsibilities resulting from decentralization, concessions&#13;
and rmaintenance management contracts, strengthen its strategic planning, management and supervision&#13;
unictions, and to re-design or improve the related work processes and methodologies; and (c) coordinate&#13;
and monitor the implementation of the project, through the assignment of a specialized Project Management&#13;
Consultant (PMC) to assist DNER Project Management Unit (PMU) and DER Subproject Management&#13;
Units (SMU) in effectively coordinating the implementation of the project and subprojects (para. 4.06).&#13;
Agiceement was reached during loan negotiations on the letter of invitation and terns of reference for the&#13;
)Pj fC contract. A condition of loan effectiveness would be that DNER has contracted the PMC.&#13;

3. 12   The project would be financed from two Bank loans of respectively US$300 million and US$200&#13;
millioni equivalent (totaling 40% of the project cost), from two proposed loans from the IDB of respectively&#13;
US$300 million and US$200 million equivalent (totaling also 40% of the project cost), and from Federal&#13;
Govetmrnent own resources for US$250 million (or 20% of the project cost). The second loan from the&#13;
Bank would be presented to the Board of Directors when an amount of at least US$225 million equivalent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(or 75%) has been disbursed from the first Bank loan, on the condition that all the covenants of the first&#13;
loan agreement are substantially complied with, and the implementation and development impact targets set&#13;
forth in the PIP are substantially met. The project financing plan is presented in Table 2, Annex 8, and is&#13;
summarized in Table 3.1 above. Agreement was reached during loan negotiations on: (a) Borrower&#13;
guarantee of counterpart funds, including funding for the concession contingency maintenance plan; and (b)&#13;
in order to permit the start up of urgent subprojects, retroactive financing in an amount of not more than&#13;
10% of the loan amount for civil works, goods, and consultant and training expenditures incurred not&#13;
earlier than January 1, 1997 or twelve months before the date of loan signing, whichever is later.&#13;
3.13   Highway rehabilitation, resurfacing, operational and safety improvement, and environmental&#13;
rehabilitation works, engineering, economic and environmental studies, works supervision, and technical&#13;
assistance, training and rmiscellaneous equipment for institutional development would be eligible for&#13;
disbursement under the loan. The loan would be disbursed at the rates of 80% of total expenditures for&#13;
eligible civil works, engineering and other studies, and works supervision, and 100% for eligible technical&#13;
assistance and training services and miscellaneous equipment. Agreement was reached during loan&#13;
negotiations on the above disbursement percentages.&#13;
D. Environmental and Economic Assessments&#13;
3.14   Environmental Effects.  The project, which consists essentially of the rehabilitation ana&#13;
resurfacing of existing paved highways, and of localized operational and safety improvements, could ha-v.&#13;
possible adverse environmental effects which, however, can be prevented or mitigated by relatively simple&#13;
measures. The project has therefore been rated "B" for environmental assessment purposes. The possible&#13;
adverse effects of the rehabilitation, resurfacing and most operational and safety improvement works are&#13;
limited to those resulting from quarrying, borrow pits, or the disposal of used pavement materials. Sorme&#13;
operational and safety improvement works, such as the construction of climbing lanes, widening of&#13;
shoulders and the improvement of curves and intersections, could have adverse impacts on the people living&#13;
close to the highway, if they are located in high population density areas, or on slope erosion if they aie&#13;
located in mountainous terrain. In addition, since in the past many highways were built without adequate&#13;
attention to the environment, the related environmental liabilities, which generally consist of uncontrolled&#13;
erosion, adversely affect highway structures or right-of-ways, sometimes adjacent properties.&#13;
3.15   Environmental Management Plan. In order to effectively prevent or mitigate such adverse&#13;
impacts, DNER has prepared and would implement an environmental management plan (Annex 5). In&#13;
particular, DNER has established an environmental unit with adequately trained staff Through Resolution&#13;
No. 126/96 of its Administrative Council, DNER has put into effect a manual of environmental norms and&#13;
instructions for road engineering and works (the Environmental Manual, EM), which was reviewed by the&#13;
appraisal mission and found satisfactory. DNER has also initiated the preparation of a resettlement polic-&#13;
framework which, after approval by the Bank, would be put into effect by the end of 1997. The seven&#13;
participating DERs would be required, through the delegation agreements, to adopt the EM and the&#13;
resettlement framework for all project investments. The standard terms of reference (TOR) of the&#13;
engineering studies for all project investments, which are included in the OM, as well as those for the&#13;
concession projects, which have been reviewed by the appraisal mission, include satisfactory requirements&#13;
for environmental and resettlement screening, assessments and management, and the necessary references&#13;
to the EM and to the resettlement framework. Also, the engineering consultants are required to identify&#13;
environmental liabilities along the highways under study, organize the related information in DNER's road&#13;
database, design appropriate corrective measures and works, and incorporate such corrective measures and&#13;
works, together with the normal prevention measures, into the highway rehabilitation or concession&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
contracts. The standard forms of contracts for works or concessions will also incorporate all necessary&#13;
enviromnental management requirements and references to the EM. Adequate supervision and control of&#13;
the engineering studies and works will be carried out by DNER and the DERs' environmental units, and by&#13;
the project management consultant, in order to ensure effective implementation. It was agreed during loan&#13;
negotiations that DNER would: (a) provide evidence by December 31, 1997 that it has adopted a&#13;
resettlement policy framework acceptable to the Bank; and (b) present for comments the environmental&#13;
specifications of the tender documents for the first three concessions.&#13;
3.16   Project Benefits. The project's main objective is to improve and maintain the serviceability of&#13;
the main highway network with a view to reduce the cost of road transport. Road users, and producers&#13;
and consumers of goods transported by road, would benefit from reduced vehicle operating costs and&#13;
from travel time savings, as well as from fewer accidents and improved comfort. DNER, the Federal&#13;
and the state governments, and ultimately taxpayers would benefit from the reduced recurrent costs of&#13;
maintaining the highways which would be rehabilitated under the project, as well as from the avoided&#13;
higher costs of future reconstruction. They would also benefit from the transfer of highway costs to&#13;
users under the concession program supported by the project. As a result, the state governments&#13;
wouild niot incur a significant increase of their expenditure responsibilities as a consequence of&#13;
decentralization. The three components of the project are separable. The decentralization and the&#13;
federal components which, together, account for over 99 percent of project cost, have been evaluated&#13;
jointly as well as separately (Annex 7, sections E-G).&#13;
3.17   Economic Evaluation.  The design of the project was optimized through the economic&#13;
analysis. The methodology consisted in comparing the Net Present Value (NPV) of alternative network&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance strategies and associated programs, and selecting the strategies which&#13;
mnaximize the NPV under various budget constraints. The costs and benefits of each alternative were&#13;
quantified with the help of the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM III).&#13;
The optimum rehabilitation and maintenance strategy and associated program for the agreed budget&#13;
constraint (US$225 million per year) was then selected using the Expenditure Budgeting Model. The&#13;
selected alternative would reduce the proportion of the federal highway network in poor condition from&#13;
12 percent in 1997 to less than two percent in 2002, and would increase the proportion in good&#13;
condition from about 40 percent to about 50 percent over the same period.  The average vehicle&#13;
operating cost on the network would decline from US$0.42 to about US$0.395 equivalent per vehicle-&#13;
knm. If the project is not undertaken, the proportion of the network in poor condition would increase to&#13;
about 30 percent and the proportion in good condition would decrease to less than 10 percent over the&#13;
next five years; the average vehicle operating cost would increase to about US$0.45 per vehicle-km;&#13;
and the subsequent cost of rehabilitation and maintenance of the network after 2002 would be more&#13;
than twice the cost of the project, i.e. about US$600 million per year (Annex 7, section E).&#13;
3.18   The project has an estimated NPV of about US$3.4 billion equivalent at a 12 percent discount&#13;
rate over ten years. Its internal economic rate of return (IERR) is estimated at a very high 106 percent&#13;
in the base case. The decentralization component (20 percent of project cost) has an estimated NPV of&#13;
about US$640 million and the federal highway component (79 percent of project cost) has an estimated&#13;
NPV of about US$2.8 billion equivalent. The sensitivity analyses show that if project costs were 20%&#13;
higher than expected, the IERR would still be 88 percent, and if project benefits were 20% lower than&#13;
expected, the IERR would be 84 percent. In the event that it would take six rather than four years to&#13;
complete the project, the NPV would be reduced to US$3.1 billion equivalent and the IERR to 85&#13;
percent. The project costs would have to be about four times higher, or the project benefits would&#13;
have to be four times lower than the appraisal estimates for the NPV to become negative; these are&#13;
highly unlikely scenarios (Annex 7, sections E and F).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
E. Project Risks&#13;
3.19   The main risks are: ineffective management of federal and state subprojects by DNER and the&#13;
participating DERs; inadequate coordination and monitoring of state subprojects by DNER; insufficient&#13;
counterpart funds, in particular for maintenance; delays in the approval of the proposed SNV Law by the&#13;
Congress; and lack of interest of private investors or financiers in the concession program. The experience&#13;
acquired with similar projects has been incorporated into the project's design in order to minimize these&#13;
risks. In particular, the project would provide for: adequate organizational arrangements and a project&#13;
management plan, with clearly defined processes, responsibilities and accountability; simple methodologies,&#13;
well suited to the agencies' technical capacities; a detailed project implementation plan, with suitable&#13;
indicators and targets to monitor procurement, physical and financial execution of work programs, network&#13;
condition, and agency development; well-focused technical assistance and training of DNER and DER staff&#13;
in key technical and management areas; as well as comprehensive Operational and Environmental Manuals.&#13;
3.20   DNER's project management unit (PMU) has been staffed with experienced professionals and, as a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness, would be assisted by a specialized Project Management Consultant (PMC),&#13;
with experience satisfactory to the Bank (para 4.09 (e)). The project implementation plan and the&#13;
computerized project management system (CPMS) will be the basis for managing and monitoring&#13;
implementation. In order to ensure appropriate funding, the Bank would review DNER expenditure and&#13;
funding programs each year at the time of budget preparation against the agreed targets. The Bank will&#13;
have the right to exercise appropriate remedies, including suspension of disbursements or cancellation and&#13;
reallocation of loan proceeds to well-performing subprojects, if DNER or a DER has defaulted on the&#13;
obligations to achieve the agreed targets. In the event that the Congress does not approve the SNV Law,&#13;
the decentralization agreements to be signed with all the state governments specify that the state&#13;
governments assume all operation and maintenance responsibilities on the transferred highways for a period&#13;
of at least ten years. A contingency maintenance plan was prepared for highways included in the&#13;
concession program, in case some or all the proposed concessions would not enter into effect, and the&#13;
Government would guarantee the necessary funds.&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
A. Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
4.01   The Government of Brazil (GOB) and the National Roads Department (DNER) of the Ministry of&#13;
Transport, would be responsible for implementing the project in accordance with the Project&#13;
Implementation Plan (PIP) and the Operational Manual (OM). The following sections of the PIP are&#13;
summarized hereafter: Institutional Responsibilities (section A); Organizational Arrangements (section B);&#13;
Project Implementation Action Plan (section C); Procurement Arrangements (section D); Disbursement,&#13;
Accounting and Audit Arrangements (section E); and Monitoring and Supervision Plan (section F), for&#13;
which detailed guidelines are provided in the OM. The detailed implementation arrangements, time&#13;
schedule, indicators and targets are presented in Annex 8. The Loan Agreement between the Federative&#13;
Republic of Brazil and the Bank and the Project Agreement between the Bank and DNER would specify&#13;
the above.&#13;
4.02   The Government of Brazil (GOB), through the Ministry of Transport (MT), would be&#13;
responsible for finalizing and executing the decentralization agreements with the participating states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
DNER would be responsible for implementing the project in accordance with the Project&#13;
Implementation Plan (PIP) and the Operational Manual (OM). With technical assistance from a Project&#13;
Management Consultant, DNER would in particular: (a) under the highway decentralization&#13;
component: finalize and execute the delegation agreements with the seven participating DERs; prepare&#13;
and implement, and assist participating DERs in preparing and implementing state rehabilitation&#13;
subprojects in accordance with the criteria, standards and methodologies specified in the OM, and with&#13;
the environmental norms and instructions set forth in the Environmental Manual (EM); and review and&#13;
monitor state subproject implementation, including engineering designs, economic and environmental&#13;
assessments, and procurement and disbursements; (b) under the highway concession development&#13;
component: organize and strengthen its recently-created Concession Department; establish and maintain&#13;
appropriate arbitration mechanisms for federal highway concessions; and prepare, tender, supervise&#13;
and monitor specific federal highway concession projects; and (c) under the federal highway&#13;
component: prepare and implement federal rehabilitation subprojects, contract maintenance activities on&#13;
the non-concessioned highways, prepare a strategic plan and carry out the reorganization, and&#13;
coordinate the implementation of the entire project.&#13;
4.03   The seven participating DERs would be responsible for implementing their respective state&#13;
rehabilitation subprojects in accordance with Subproject Implementation Plans (SIPs), and with the criteria,&#13;
norms and methodologies specified in the OM, including the catalogue of technical solutions, the terms of&#13;
reference for subproject studies, and the environmental norms and instructions specified in the EM. For&#13;
this purpose, DNER and the participating DERs would sign delegation agreements, which would specify&#13;
their respective responsibilities in implementing the state rehabilitation subprojects.  DNER, with&#13;
assistance from the project management consultant, would review and monitor the implementation of the&#13;
state rehabilitation subprojects against the indicators and targets included in the SIPs. It would be a&#13;
condition of disbursement under a delegated subproject that satisfactory decentralization and delegation&#13;
agreements have become effective.&#13;
4.04   The Bank would approve ex-ante all delegation agreements, including SIPs, as well as all state and&#13;
federal rehabilitation subprojects for financing under the project on the basis of subproject applications in&#13;
an agreed format. The Bank would review ex-ante procurement documentation for all contracts for works&#13;
above US$5.0 million. The Bank would monitor project implementation against the indicators and targets&#13;
included in the PIP. A detailed mid-term project implementation review would be carried out when 75% of&#13;
the loan amount is disbursed, prior to presenting the proposed second Bank loan to the Board of Directors.&#13;
In addition to reviewing overall project performance, the mission would identify problem subprojects,&#13;
which would be reformulated or terminated, and loan funds would be reallocated to well-performing states&#13;
or to DNER with the Bank's ex-ante approval (para. 4.19).&#13;
B. Organizational Arrangements&#13;
4.05   In order to coordinate the implementation of the project, the Director-General of DNER, through&#13;
Portaria No. 073/97 dated January 22, 1997, has established a Project Coordination Committee (PCC) and&#13;
a Project Management Unit (PMU), with terms of reference (Regimento Interno) which the appraisal&#13;
mission reviewed and found satisfactory. The PCC includes the Directors of the Departments involved in&#13;
the project, and is responsible for effective inter-departmental coordination. The PMU is headed by the&#13;
Chief, Planning Division (Assessoria de Planejamento), who reports directly to the Director-General. It is&#13;
responsible for the management of the overall project and for communications with the Bank, the IDB and&#13;
Federal and state government agencies. The PMU includes four central units, responsible for the&#13;
rehabilitation, decentralization, concession and institutional development components, and for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
administration, and three regional units, to be established in Salvador, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre, to&#13;
supervise the subprojects in the Northeast, Southeast and South regions respectively (Annex 6). The above&#13;
organization arrangements incorporate the experience acquired in implementing the recently-completed&#13;
Highways Management and Rehabilitation Project (Loan no. 3169-BR), which suffered from lack of&#13;
coordination among the various departments involved, and from an insufficiently staffed PMU located at a&#13;
lower organizational level. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that DNER would maintain&#13;
organizational arrangements for project execution satisfactory to the Bank, including a project coordination&#13;
committee and a project management unit with terms of reference and staffing, and headed by a project&#13;
manager with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
4.06   DNER intends to contract a specialized Project Management Consultant (PMC) to assist the PMU,&#13;
the permanent departments of DNER, and the participating DERs in effectively coordinating and carrying&#13;
out the project and the delegated subprojects. The PMC would in particular assist: the Planning Division of&#13;
DNER and the participating DERs in monitoring the network and preparing efficient annual expenditure&#13;
programs; the Engineering Division in contracting, supervising and monitoring engineering designs to&#13;
ensure consistency with the agreed pavement management, operational and safety improvement, and&#13;
environmental and resettlement management policies and standards; the Procurement Division in complying&#13;
with agreed procurement timetables and targets; the DNER districts and participating DERs in supervising&#13;
the works; the PMU and the state DERs in carrying out their project and subproject management functions.&#13;
In order to facilitate project planning, scheduling, control and coordination among the departments&#13;
involved, DNER, with assistance from the PMC, would complete the development of, and establish a&#13;
computerized project management system (CPMS). Agreement was reached during loan negotiations on:&#13;
(a) the invitation letter and TOR for the Project Management Consultant; (b) the establishment of the&#13;
CPMS not later than three months after the effective date of the loan; and, as a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness, that DNER would: (c) contract the PMC on the basis of the agreed TOR.&#13;
4.07   DNER has recently established a Concession Department responsible for carrying out the highway&#13;
concession program. The department is headed by a Director who reports directly to the Director-General&#13;
(Annex 10, Chart 1). The department includes a Concession Development Division, responsible for&#13;
planning, studies, project finance and marketing, and a Concession Supervision Division, responsible for&#13;
supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and user relations. DNER's regional districts would establish&#13;
concession operations and supervision sections where appropriate (Annex 4). DNER would contract a&#13;
intemational consulting firm with extensive international experience in highway concessions to help&#13;
organize and strengthen the Concession Department and to train its staff. Agreement was reached during&#13;
loan negotiations on: (a) the TOR for the concession technical assistance assignment; and (b) DNER to&#13;
contract the highway concession consultant by December 31, 1997.&#13;
4.08   The participating DERs, which have recently completed or are currently carrying out projects&#13;
financed by the Bank or the IDB, have adequate implementation capabilities. They have started&#13;
establishing organizational arrangements to carry out their subprojects. Execution responsibilities would be&#13;
distributed according to the specific organization of each DER. Each participating DER has established a&#13;
Subproject Management Unit (SMU), headed by a qualified and experienced Subproject Manager, who&#13;
reports directly to the DER Director-General. With these arrangements and with the assistance of the&#13;
PMC, the participating DERs would have the capabilities to carry out the respective subprojects efficiently&#13;
under the coordination and monitoring of the PMU. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations&#13;
that each participating DER would establish and/or maintain organizational arrangements for subproject&#13;
execution satisfactory to the Bank including, as conditions of loan disbursement under a delegated state&#13;
rehabilitation subproject: (a) a Subproject Management Unit (SMU), with adequate structure, functions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
and responsibilities; (b) a computerized management system interfaced with the DNER CPMS; and (c)&#13;
adoption of the Operational and .Environmental Manuals.&#13;

reviewed by the appraisal mission&#13;
and found satisfactory, and which, after approval by the Bank, will be included in the OM. The value of&#13;
individual civil works contracts is expected to vary between US$1.0 and US$10.0 million (total cost about&#13;
US$570 million). Miscellaneous road laboratory and office equipment and software would be purchased&#13;
by shopping on the basis of price quotations from at least three eligible suppliers, when they cannot be&#13;
packaged in contracts exceeding US$100,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million. NCB&#13;
procedures would be used for contracts for goods exceeding US$100,000 and below US$350,000 in the&#13;
event that such contracts are required. Consultants for detailed engineering, construction supervision,&#13;
technical assistance and training programs would be selected and engaged following Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by Borrowers (January 1997), and the standard contract issued&#13;
by the Bank would be used for complex, time-based assignments.&#13;
4.12    DNER is the principal implementing agency, responsible for carrying out all the federal and some&#13;
state rehabilitation subprojects, and for reviewing and monitoring the delegated state rehabilitation&#13;
subprojects, including all procurement. DNER's organization for and experience with procurement were&#13;
reviewed during appraisal and found to be satisfactory. All the seven executing DERs have implemented&#13;
Bank or IDB-financed projects and therefore have experience with Bank and/or IDB procurement.&#13;
However, before sending a delegated state rehabilitation subproject to the Bank for review, the PMU,&#13;
through the PMC, would make a detailed review of the executing DER's procurement organization and&#13;
capacity, and, if necessary, seek agreement on actions to strengthen such procurement capacity. The PMU,&#13;
through the PMC, would provide technical assistance and training services as necessary. The Borrowers'&#13;
procurement law (Law no. 8.666 of June 21, 1993), as amended, specifically authorizes executing agencies&#13;
to procure goods and services financed by multilateral institutions in accordance with the norms and&#13;
procedures of the financial institutions. All ICB contracts, the first two NCB contracts for civil works&#13;
procured by DNER and each executing DER, all contracts for goods estimated at US$350,000 equivalent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
or more, the first two NCB contracts for goods, all contracts with consulting firms estimated at&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent or more, and all contracts with individual consultants estimated at US$50,000&#13;
equivalent or more, would be subject to the Bank's prior review of all procurement documentation and&#13;
decisions. These prior-review arrangements would cover contracts totaling about 70% of the total cost of&#13;
Bank-financed works, goods and services. The balance of contracts would be subject to selective ex-post&#13;
review by the Bank after contract award. Agreement was reached during loan negotiations on the above&#13;
procurement arrangements.&#13;
E. Disbursement, Accounting and Audit Arrangements&#13;
4.13   The Bank loan would be disbursed for: (a) civil works, at the rate of 80% of total expenditures; (b)&#13;
equipment, at the rate of 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost), and&#13;
80% of local expenditures for other items procured locally; (c) consultant services for studies at the rate of&#13;
80% of total expenditures; and (d) consultant services for technical assistance and staff training at the rate&#13;
of 100% of expenditures. The allocations of the proceeds of the loan are shown in Table 3, Annex 8.&#13;
Based upon experience with similar projects and the relevant standard disbursement profile for highway&#13;
projects, the implementation period for the project is estimated at six years. The project completion date&#13;
would therefore be June 30, 2002, and the Closing Date would be December 31, 2002. The estimated loan&#13;
disbursement schedule is shown in Table 4, Annex 8.&#13;
4.14   In order to reduce the interval during which the Borrower would finance the Bank's share of project&#13;
cost with their own resources, the Borrower would establish a Special Account (SA) in US dollars in a&#13;
commercial bank to cover the local and foreign currency expenditures of the project. The Bank would&#13;
deposit up to US$30.0 million in the SA. The Bank would replenish the Special Account for the amount of&#13;
withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures at the request of the Borrower. DNER has adequate&#13;
accounting control to enable disbursement to be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures.&#13;
Supporting documentation with respect to expenditures against contracts valued at up to US$5.0 million&#13;
equivalent for civil works, US$350,000 equivalent for goods, and US$100,000 equivalent for consulting&#13;
firm services, would be retained by DNER and/or the participating DERs, be available for inspection&#13;
during project supervision missions, and be subject to auditing by the extemal auditors. Expenditures for&#13;
contracts above these limits and for all contracts with individual consultants would be documented. During&#13;
loan negotiations, agreement was reached with the GOB on: (a) the above disbursement arrangements; and&#13;
(b) contracting by DNER of independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank, to audit their accounts, including&#13;
the project accounts, the Special Account and the Statements of Expenditures, and to fumish the auditors'&#13;
reports to the Bank not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
F. Monitoring and Supervision Plan&#13;
4.15   DNER would establish an appropriate computerized project management system to monitor the&#13;
implementation of the project, so as to produce adequate information to report to DNER management and&#13;
to the Bank. Participating DERs, as a condition of disbursement under delegated state rehabilitation&#13;
subprojects, would establish similar systems, interfaced with the DNER system, in accordance with the&#13;
specifications included in the OM, so as to produce consistent information on subproject implementation&#13;
and to report to the PMU. During negotiations, agreement was reached that DNER would prepare and&#13;
forward to the Bank quarterly progress reports, in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the OM,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank and the IDB, not later than one month after the end of each quarter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
4.16   The PMU, assisted by the PMC, would coordinate and monitor the implementation of the project,&#13;
and review the following documents prepared by DNER or the participating DERs: (a) financing&#13;
application forms for subprojects included in the annual rehabilitation and maintenance programs and&#13;
proposed for Bank or IDB financing; (b) annual procurement and execution time schedules;&#13;
(c) procurement documentation for civil works and equipment; (d) terms of reference, invitation letters,&#13;
shortlists and draft contracts for consultant services; and (e) DER quarterly subproject implementation&#13;
progress reports; and would forward them to the Bank as appropriate. PMU and PMC staff would carry&#13;
out state subproject review missions, and would participate in the Bank's and the IDB's supervision&#13;
missions to the states.&#13;
4.17   The Bank and the IDB would coordinate their supervision work programs, in order to avoid&#13;
duplication of efforts. In particular, delegated state rehabilitation subprojects would be assigned to the&#13;
institution which is already actively involved in the state's highway sector. The Bank would retain full&#13;
responsibility for approving all the documents mentioned in the previous paragraph and the related actions&#13;
by DNER and the participating DERs in respect of the subprojects financed by the Bank. The Bank would&#13;
supervise and monitor the implementation of the project in accordance with the Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
Plan presented in Annex 9. The estimates of Bank supervision inputs into key activities, which are shown&#13;
in the table of Annex 9, take into consideration the expected contributions of the PMU and the PMC, as&#13;
well as the above-mentioned coordination with the IDB.&#13;
4.18   The implementation of the project would be monitored against the time schedule and the&#13;
development objective and implementation progress monitoring indicators and targets set forth in the PIP&#13;
and in a Project Monitoring Letter (Annex 8, Chart 1 and Table 1). The development objective indicators&#13;
are: (i) surface condition of the federal and transferred networks measured by the percentages of the&#13;
network length in poor condition (IRI above 5) and in good condition (IRI below 3); (ii) average vehicle&#13;
operating costs on the network calculated with the HDM III model as calibrated during the appraisal&#13;
mission; (iii) highway transfers to states measured in km; (iv) federal highway concessions tendered&#13;
measured in thousand km; (v) maintenance management contracts measured by the percentage of the non-&#13;
concessioned federal network length maintained by private contractors under performance-based&#13;
management contracts; (vi) DNER design and supervision effectiveness measured by the average cost per&#13;
km of rehabilitation subprojects; (vii) DER planning and programming capacity measured by the number&#13;
of DERs with a pavement management system. The implementation progress indicators are: (viii) the&#13;
numbers of decentralization and delegation agreements signed; (ix) rehabilitation works procured and&#13;
executed, on federal and transferred highways, measured in thousand km; (x) average costs per km of the&#13;
operational and safety improvement and environmental rehabilitation works; (xi) funding levels for routine&#13;
maintenance and for the project; and (xii) technical assistance and training measured by the total number of&#13;
man-months and trainee-weeks respectively.&#13;
4.19   A comprehensive Mid-Term review of the implementation of the project would be carried out when&#13;
75 percent of the loan amount has been disbursed, prior to presenting the proposed second loan to the&#13;
Board of Executive Directors. The review will cover all the agreed actions, target dates, and development&#13;
objective and implementation progress indicators included in the PIP and the SIPs and the status of&#13;
compliance with all covenants of the Loan and Project Agreements and the highway decentralization and&#13;
delegation agreements. Particular importance will be given to: (a) the Borrower's commitment to provide&#13;
adequate funds for maintenance and rehabilitation, and counterpart funds for the project; and (b)&#13;
MT/DNER performance under the agreed decentralization, concession, and federal highway components.&#13;
The monitoring targets for the subsequent years would be revised if the additional financing from the Bank&#13;
and/or the IDB would not be forthcoming. The Bank would have the right to exercise appropriate remedies&#13;
if performance is not satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Bank Experience with Highway Projects in Brazil&#13;
A. Highway Project Summaries&#13;
1.    The Bank approved twelve loans for highways and three loans for feeder roads in Brazil&#13;
between 1968 and 1991. This section provides a summary for each project.&#13;
2.    The First Highway Project (Loan 567-BR, US$26 million, October 1968) was instrumental in&#13;
setting the framework for Bank involvement in the Brazilian transport sector. Together with this loan,&#13;
the Bank reached agreement with the Government on a Plan of Action which included, among other&#13;
elements, the reorganization of DNER, the revision of road-user charges, the reduction of railway&#13;
deficits and the improvement of port administration. The project included detailed engineering,&#13;
construction, paving, and supervision of seven road sections totaling 429 km in four states. The&#13;
project was successfully completed in September 1972, about a year later than expected. The delay&#13;
was mainly due to design changes and problems with earthworks. Despite cost overruns in some&#13;
sections, total project costs were lower than anticipated. The audit reestimated rates of return for the&#13;
roads were, except for one road, equal to or higher than the appraisal estimates; they ranged from 14%&#13;
to 40% (PPAR No.626 dated Feb.12, 1976).&#13;
3.    The Second Highway Project (Loan 676-BR, US$100 million, May 1970) included&#13;
construction and paving of 2,136 km of roads, detailed engineering of 2,369 km, and feasibility studies&#13;
of 3,256 km. The project provided technical assistance to strengthen the planning and supervisory&#13;
capabilities of DNER. Problems were encountered during construction, and delays occurred. As a&#13;
result, the project was not completed until August 1976, two years behind schedule. Final cost was&#13;
about 6% above appraisal estimates. The audit rate of return for the project was higher than the&#13;
appraisal estimate (36% as against 27%), mainly because of much higher-than-anticipated traffic&#13;
growth. This was the first major road project carried out entirely by Brazilian firms under strict&#13;
specifications and quality controls agreed with the Bank. The experiences gained by the Brazilian&#13;
construction industry and DNER during the execution of the project were considerable, as&#13;
demonstrated by the performance of follow-up projects (PPAR No. 644, dated June 21, 1977, PCR&#13;
dated October 27, 1976).&#13;
4.    The Third and Fourth Highway Projects (Loan 813-BR, US$89 million, April 1972, and&#13;
Loan 854-BR, US$51 million, August 1972) included construction of 1,849 km, paving of 681 km of&#13;
roads, and related supervision. Civil works in both projects faced the same problems encountered&#13;
during the Second Highway Project. Completion of both projects, initially scheduled for 1976, was at&#13;
the end of 1977. Underestimation of physical quantities and acceleration of inflation in 1973 and 1974&#13;
caused substantial cost overruns. Reestimated rates of return, however, were considerably above&#13;
appraisal estimates: 45% and 29% against 25% and 16% respectively. The PPAR noted that&#13;
inadequate detailed engineering for these two projects contributed to substantial quantity and cost&#13;
increases. It also pointed out deficiencies in traffic forecasting (PCR dated May 30, 1978, PPAR No.&#13;
2571 of June 8, 1979).&#13;
&#13;

5.    The Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1075-BR, US$110 million, January 1975) set the basis for&#13;
Bank involvement in road maintenance, rehabilitation and strengthening. The project included: (a)&#13;
construction and upgrading of 612 km of federal highways; (b) highway maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
programs in the States of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul and technical assistance to DNER to&#13;
improve maintenance planning; (c) Phase I of a Weighing Station Program; (d) detailed engineering for&#13;
road construction, upgrading and rehabilitation; and (e) feasibility studies for three new highways&#13;
totaling about 900 km. The project achieved its original objective in upgrading, and increasing the&#13;
capacity of, congested road links included in the project, although these works were completed with&#13;
about three years' delay and substantial cost overuns. The technical assistance achieved less than&#13;
expected, partly because the systems developed by consultants were too complicated and did not take&#13;
local conditions into account. Largely because of inadequate preparation, the weigh bridge program&#13;
was delayed and only partially completed, with significant cost overuns (PCR dated May 8, 1985).&#13;
6.    The Secondary and Feeder Roads Project (Loan 1207-BR, US$55 million, March 1976) was&#13;
conceived as a line of credit extended to Brazil's National Economic Development Bank, BNDES, to&#13;
finance about 50 % of subloans extended by BNDES to state DERs or municipal road consortia to carry&#13;
out secondary and feeder road programs in support of agricultural production.  Subprojects were&#13;
prepared and evaluated in accordance with agreed and well-publicized criteria embodied in a manual.&#13;
The loan helped finance 18 subprojects in 12 States comprising 5,400 km of roads and 110 separate&#13;
bridges. The project was slow in starting because beneficiaries took more time than anticipated to&#13;
establish their working relationships with BNDES. Implementation has also been slowed by financial&#13;
problems, which were resolved through the Bank's Special Assistance Program, by providing&#13;
supplementary subloans under the Second Feeder Road Project. The project was completed in mid-&#13;
1984, with a three-and-a-half year delay (PCR dated June 14, 1985, PPAR dated September 23, 1986).&#13;
7.    The Sixth Highway Project (Loan 1557-BR, US$114 million, August 1978) continued to&#13;
support rehabilitation and maintenance. The project included (a) rehabilitation of about 2,300 km of&#13;
paved federal highways and detailed engineering for another 3,000 km of rehabilitation works; (b) a&#13;
highway maintenance and rehabilitation program in the State of Parana; (c) Phase II of the Weighing&#13;
Station Program; and (d) consulting services to the Road Research Institute (IPR) to carry out research&#13;
on pavement overlay design and to GEIPOT to complete research on the Highway Design and&#13;
Maintenance Model.  Project implementation was delayed from the start,  because of lack of&#13;
counterpart funding, until mid-1983 when the Bank's Special Action Program, by increasing&#13;
disbursement percentages, helped the project to be completed in the second half of 1985. The weigh&#13;
bridge program remained incomplete. DNER's pavement research program, completed in late 1984,&#13;
introduced a new standard for pavement overlay design. DER-Parana's maintenance operations were&#13;
successfully strengthened (PCR dated March 20, 1987, PPAR dated November 16, 1989).&#13;
8.    The Second Feeder Roads Project (Loan 1730-BR, US$110 million, June 1979) was to&#13;
provide continuity to the program initiated by the First Project and implemented through BNDES. The&#13;
19 subprojects in 13 states together consisted of the construction or improvement of 255 road links&#13;
totaling about 4,900 km, and of the construction of 370 bridges. Lack of counterpart funds slowed&#13;
down implementation in 1982 and 1983. The Bank's Special Assistance Program helped resolve the&#13;
funding problems. Part of the loan was used to provide supplementary financing under the first&#13;
Project. The project was completed and the loan fully disbursed by the end of 1986, in line with the&#13;
appraisal schedule. By requiring economic analyses and appropriate engineering standards, the first&#13;
and second projects helped state road administrations improve planning, engineering and management&#13;
of feeder roads programs country-wide. But maintenance capabilities remained weak in many states&#13;
(PCR dated November 6, 1989, PPAR No. 9367 dated February 15, 1991).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

9.    The Northwest Region Development Program, Highway Project (Loan 2062-BR, US$240&#13;
million, November 1981), consisted of: (a) construction of the Campinas-Ariquemes section (about&#13;
1,084 km) of the Northwest Highway, BR-364; (b) strengthening of Rondonia State Highway&#13;
Department (DER-RO); and (c) construction and improvement of about 1,000 km of roads in the States&#13;
of Rondonia and Mato Grosso through BNDES' feeder roads program.  The construction of the&#13;
Northwest Highway, after initial delays due to inadequate funding, accelerated in the second half of&#13;
1983 with the Bank's Special Action Program, and was completed in late 1984, one year ahead of&#13;
schedule. The program for strengthening the State Highway Department of Rondonia made little&#13;
progress due to delays in contracting the consultants and to subsequent suspension of disbursements for&#13;
delays under environmental components of the Northwest Region Development Program. The feeder&#13;
road component was completed on schedule. In mid-1985, the Bank agreed to re-allocate about US$60&#13;
million of loan savings for an emergency flood rehabilitation program in six Northeastern states, which&#13;
was completed by mid-1987. The highway project upgraded the region's transport system but the&#13;
Northwest Development Program, of which the project was only one component, failed in its basic&#13;
objective of harmoniously developing the region. The improvement of the highway and feeder roads&#13;
and failures or delays in implementing the environmental and indigenous people protection programs&#13;
under the associated projects led to a destructive and disordely colonization process, with long-term&#13;
damage to the environment, encroachment onto Amerindian and natural reserves, and concentration of&#13;
migrants in ill-equipped urban settlements (PCR dated April 15, 1991).&#13;
10.   The Third Feeder Roads Project (Loan 2224-BR, US$154 million, December 1982)&#13;
supported the continuation of the National Feeder Roads Program, administered by BNDES, including&#13;
strengthening of project management. The project was to build or improve 8,000 km of roads at a cost&#13;
of about US$500 million over the period 1983-mid 1989, and to improve the maintenance capability of&#13;
subborrowers through technical assistance for advisory services and training of staff . The project was&#13;
implemented expeditiously, within the original timeframe. Physical results exceeded targets by more&#13;
than 20% (Almost 10,000 km of roads were built or improved, 70% in the low income states in the&#13;
North, Northeast and Center-West regions. The three feeder roads projects helped develop state&#13;
capacities for preparing, evaluating and implementing feeder roads programs on the basis of&#13;
appropriate selection criteria and methodologies, and technical norms and standards.  BNDES&#13;
strengthened its management of the program, but the fiscal reform and decentralization introduced with&#13;
the 1988 constitution led to the termination of the program (PCR dated June 11, 1993).&#13;
11.   The Federal Highways Sector Project (Loan 2446-BR, US$210 million, June 1984) supported&#13;
DNER's 1984-1987 Investment Program, including highway rehabilitation, road safety, training of&#13;
DNER and state highway maintenance personnel, and technical assistance for a pavement management&#13;
system, an equipment management system, and highway research studies.  Implementation was&#13;
expeditious, despite DNER budget cuts on several occasions.  Physical targets of highway&#13;
rehabilitation were exceeded by one-fifth. Procurement led to lower-than-expected bid prices but&#13;
subsequent contract modifications led to increased costs. The impact of road safety investments was&#13;
difficult to judge because of the absence of monitoring. The training program for the DERs was&#13;
successful, but DNER gave priority to physical investments over technical assistance, which had&#13;
minimum results (PCR dated June 15, 1992).&#13;
12.   The Sao Paulo State Highway Management Project (Loan 2830-BR, US$174 million, June&#13;
1987) comprised: (a) rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works on about 5,100 km of state&#13;
highways; (b) equipment rehabilitation; (c) training of highway staff; and (d) technical assistance for&#13;
transport sector policy, planning and operations, pavement and bridge management systems, and road&#13;
research. The project started only in July 1988 due to administrative difficulties for loan signing. It&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -                                Annex 1&#13;
made good progress until mid-1991, but remained virtually stalled until early 1995 due to the serious&#13;
financial difficulties of the state. Implementation resumed in 1995, after the state government cleared&#13;
significant arrears owed to contractors and the Bank extended the closing date to December 1995. The&#13;
scope of the project was reduced, and about US$32 million was canceled from the loan. In spite of the&#13;
implementation difficulties, 4,000 km of roads were rehabilitated, reducing the portion of the network&#13;
in poor condition from about 40% to 6%, and the institutional component was substantially completed&#13;
at closing (PCR dated October 25, 1996).&#13;
13.   The Highway Management and Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3169-BR, US$310 million,&#13;
February 1990, closed December 31, 1996) helped redefine the federal highway network, restructure&#13;
the national highway department, rehabilitate and maintain highways in major transport corridors,&#13;
improve sector policy formulation and strategic planning, and develop and improve compliance with&#13;
environmental standards in the transport sector.  Project starting was delayed by modifications&#13;
requested by the incoming government and approved by the Board. Implementation was affected by&#13;
Government stabilization efforts and consequent insufficient counterpart fund transfers.   But&#13;
implementation improved after the Bank increased disbursement percentages and canceled US$40&#13;
million from the loan in early 1995. The appraisal targets for the works were met or exceeded. The&#13;
policy and institutional component, which had been affected by the numerous changes of sector&#13;
administration, was also succesfully completed (draft PCR dated May 15, 1997).&#13;
14.   The State Highway Management Project (Loans 3547-BR and 3548-BR, US$88 million,&#13;
December 1992) is helping rehabilitate and maintain the state highway networks in the states of Santa&#13;
Catarina and Alagoas, and to strengthen the state highway agencies' (DERs) planning, contract&#13;
maintenance and environmental management capabilities.   Both the physical and institutional&#13;
components of the Santa Catarina subproject have progressed satisfactorily in spite of the recent&#13;
financial difficulties of the state. But progress under the Alagoas subproject has been unsatisfactory.&#13;
Because of the financial difficulties of the State and insufficient counterpart funding in 1994-95, a&#13;
number of rehabilitation contracts had to be terminated. The subproject was restructured in early&#13;
1996, increasing disbursement percentages and cancelling US$18 million from the loan. The reforms&#13;
introduced by the state government in 1996 have enabled the works to be re-tendered and re-initiated in&#13;
accordance with the available counterpart funds. The institutional component, which initially made&#13;
slow progress due to the numerous changes of administration, is now progressing satisfactorily.&#13;
15.   The State Highway Management II Project (Loans 3713-BR, 3714-BR &amp; 3715-BR, US$220&#13;
million,  March 1994) is assisting the states of Piaui, Tocantins and Maranhao to develop and&#13;
implement efficient road expenditure programs, with adequate priority to maintenance, and to&#13;
strengthen the planning, contract maintenance and environmental management capabilities of the states'&#13;
highway agencies. Project startup has been satisfactory in the three states. The monetary reform&#13;
introduced with the Plano Real in mid-1995, however, has substantially affected the financial capacities&#13;
of the states, particularly Piaui and, to a lesser extent, Maranhao. Implementation targets at the end of&#13;
1995 were substantially met in Tocantins. But the two subprojects in Piaui and Maranhao were&#13;
restructured in November 1995 in line with the states' financial capacities, reducing the upgrading and&#13;
paving targets while keeping maintenance and rehabilitation targets, canceling US$18 million from&#13;
each loan, and increasing disbursement percentages. With this project restructuring and the reform&#13;
measures introduced by the state governments, the performance of the two subprojects substantially&#13;
improved in 1996 and is now satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;

B. Lessons Learned&#13;
15.    The following important lessons learned from the experience with the above projects have been&#13;
incorporated into the design and preparation of the proposed project.&#13;
16.   Counterpart Funding, Budgets. The counterpart funding problems have been recurrent and&#13;
have adversely affected the implementation of the physical investment components of most projects.&#13;
Government efforts to contain public expenditures in order to achieve important economic stabilization&#13;
objectives have been the main reasons. Despite the recent measures taken by the Government to give&#13;
the highest priority to Bank-financed projects, insufficient and unreliable counterpart transfers from the&#13;
Treasury have continued to affect project implementation. In addition, the budgetary process, which&#13;
enables the Congress to change individual allocations for specific road sections, often results in&#13;
inconsistent budgets and inefficient execution of contracts. In order to substantially reduce the impact&#13;
of such unreliable counterpart transfers on the execution of individual contracts and on project&#13;
implementation, disbursements could be made in quasi-tranches against eligible expenditures after&#13;
compliance with agreed physical and institutional implementation monitoring targets.&#13;
17.   Project Implementation Plan and Monitoring Indicators. With the exception of the recently&#13;
approved state highway management projects, the projects did not include detailed implementation&#13;
plans, appropriate indicators and targets, and computerized project management and monitoring&#13;
systems to effectively monitor project implementation, progress in fulfilling the development&#13;
objectives, and the performance of the implementing agency. As a consequence, project managers and&#13;
Bank supervision missions were unable to identify implementation delays and issues early enough to&#13;
seek timely remedial measures. The lack of detailed implementation plans, monitorable indicators and&#13;
adequate and timely project information was a major factor in the substantial delays encountered in&#13;
subproject/ investment engineering and procurement of contracts.&#13;
18.    Expenditure Planning and Progranmning, Network Management. The investments financed&#13;
under the highway and the feeder road projects have been justified in economic terms, and technical&#13;
solutions have been optimized at the level of each individual investment. But technical solutions and&#13;
priorities have not been optimized and justified from a network management perspective, taking into&#13;
account existing resource constraints. This shortcoming has led to substantial over-dimensioning of&#13;
individual investments, to the postponment of other essential expenditures, in particular maintenance,&#13;
and, as a consequence, to the deterioration of the overall network condition. It is therefore essential to&#13;
assess and compare alternative expenditure policies and strategies in order to optimize highway&#13;
expenditure programs and individual project investments on the basis of appropriate technical and&#13;
economic criteria and budget constraints. Experience was gained with the recent state highway projects&#13;
in carrying out regular network condition surveys, in establishing a network database, and in&#13;
optimizing expenditure strategies and programs using the Highway Design &amp; Maintenance Standards&#13;
(HDM) Model.&#13;
19.   Maintenance by Contract.  Experience with earlier highway and feeder roads projects in&#13;
Brazil and worldwide has shown that highway maintenance, when carried out by force account, is&#13;
generally ineffective. In addition to the difficulties in ensuring the necessary and timely transfers of&#13;
resources from the Treasury, government road agencies have demonstrated their inability to effectively&#13;
manage the numerous activities, the personnel and the equipment required for highway maintenance.&#13;
Since the early 1980s, DNER has contracted out the (routine) maintenance of the federal highway&#13;
network, except for highways in Amazonia; the experience has been successful in ensuring the&#13;
effective delivery of routine maintenance services at reasonable costs.  The forms of contracts,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-                                   Annex 1&#13;
however, still require heavy supervision from DNER. New forms of (performance) contracts, which&#13;
would pay contractors on the basis of the level of service maintained rather than of the quantities of&#13;
work performed, could be more effective and should be tested. Also, the state highway agencies, most&#13;
of which still maintain their networks by force account, should now initiate contract maintenance&#13;
programs.&#13;
20.   Design and Implementation of Institutional Components. Borrowers and executing agencies&#13;
have generally given higher priority to physical investments than to the institutional components,&#13;
which often fell short of achieving their objectives. The frequent changes in sector administrations and&#13;
management personnel have been an important factor. But the scope and timetable of the agreed&#13;
institutional components have often been over-optimistic, and have underestimated the difficulties of&#13;
the reforms. In order to be effective, the institutional components of projects need to be focused on&#13;
addressing a few essential issues. Their design and timetables should be realistic, and based on a&#13;
detailed analysis of the capacities of the organizations to implement them. If possible, disbursements&#13;
for the physical components should be linked to progress made under the institutional components.&#13;
21.   Environmental Management.   The experience with the Northwest Region Development&#13;
Program showed that highway and feeder roads investments can lead to significant long-term&#13;
environmental damage by enabling destructive and disorderly colonization and economic activities, if&#13;
the necessary measures to prevent or mitigate the potential adverse impacts are not promptly&#13;
implemented. Also, road works can have more direct adverse environrnental effects, such as increased&#13;
soil erosion. The ongoing Highway Management and Rehabilitation Project has been successful in&#13;
developing and disseminating Environmental Guidelines for the transport sector and for the highway&#13;
subsector, and in training federal transport sector staff.  The recent State Highway Projects are&#13;
effectively helping participating state governments to establish appropriate road environmental&#13;
management capabilities. These efforts should be continued and expanded countrywide.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Federal Highway Maintenance Strategy and Program&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    Too often in the past, subprojects of road rehabilitation for the federal highways were designed and&#13;
implemented without due consideration to the overall needs of the network and to DNER budget&#13;
constraints. Even though the rehabilitation works carried out during the past fifteen years were supported&#13;
by economic analysis confirming that intemal rates of return of at least 12% were obtained, their priority&#13;
was not always demonstrated and the technical solutions selected did not necessarily correspond to&#13;
standards yielding the maximum net present value to the community, and even less so in the context of a&#13;
global analysis encompassing the entire highway network, under resource constraints. Generally, the&#13;
adoption of over-designed subprojects, sometimes associated with premature execution, absorbs a great&#13;
deal of available funds, leaving little resources for the rest of the network. The result, in the long term, is a&#13;
dramatic increase in the proportion of roads in poor condition, and thus in transport costs.&#13;
2.    In order to formulate the most appropriate policy, i.e., a suitable set of technical standards for the&#13;
maintenance of the federal highway network and to design a cost-effective program of implementation&#13;
which assigns priorities and cost thresholds to the execution of rehabilitation works, an economic analysis&#13;
using the HDM/EBM models was performed. This analysis included the entire federal network to remain&#13;
under federal jurisdiction and the portion to be devolved to the states and a realistic level of budget&#13;
constraints over the next five years. The main objective was to derive from the analysis the best strategy&#13;
consistent with attainable budget levels. The strategy would comprise: (a) a catalogue of technical&#13;
solutions adapted to road conditions and traffic, to be applied throughout the project, associating with each&#13;
solution with an average (maximum) unit cost, and (b) a phasing of execution of the program which would&#13;
be in line with the priorities as defined by the economic models. During the implementation of the project,&#13;
a reasonable degree of consistency would be sought between the standards and unit costs based upon&#13;
engineering studies, and the technical solutions derived from the HDMtEBM network evaluation.&#13;
B. Network Analysis&#13;
3.    Comprehensive network monitoring and analyses have been carried out twice in the past by DNER:&#13;
in 1986 and in 1992. In order to build the decentralization project upon more reliable and updated&#13;
information, an extensive program of road measurements was carried out between June 1995 and March&#13;
1996, with the assistance of DNER regional districts supplemented by six consulting firms. Practically, the&#13;
entire length of the paved federal highways, i.e., about 51,000 km, was divided among the five regions and&#13;
thoroughly surveyed.&#13;
4.    The surveys included:&#13;
(i)   the assessment, on a continuous basis, of the geometric and structural characteristics of the roads,&#13;
as well as the surface defects observed on the pavements, i.e., proportion of cracking or raveling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -                                  Annex 2&#13;
and areas of potholes, assigning to each km a rating or note of between I and 5 (5 being excellent,&#13;
and 1 very poor);&#13;
(ii)   the measurement, also on a continuous basis, of the international roughness index (IRI) of each&#13;
homogeneous section of the network, using calibrated response-type equipment;&#13;
(iii)   deflection measurements within 1,500 one-km-long segments of the network, selected as being&#13;
representative of the condition of homogeneous links;&#13;
(iv)   traffic counts at about 250 sites located so as to supplement the information collected from other&#13;
major locations where DNER systematically carries out traffic volume censuses.&#13;
5.     All the information obtained from the surveys was compiled into a computerized data bank&#13;
designed to enable statistical evaluations to be made, and to calculate the weighted average values of the&#13;
parameters characterizing each cell of a matrix comprising groups of homogeneous links, in terms of&#13;
traffic, roughness, and structural capacity. Table 3 of this annex indicates how the federal network was&#13;
classified as a function of traffic volume, surface condition, and deflection.&#13;
C. Alternative Maintenance Strategies&#13;
6.     Annex 7, on the project's economic analysis, presents the detailed methodology used for the&#13;
definition of the various maintenance options taken into account in the economic evaluation. Broadly&#13;
speaking, the following alternatives were selected as being representative:&#13;
(i)   for roads in good condition (IRI&lt;3), patching and simple resurfacing using surface treatments or&#13;
slurry seals, and also a thin asphalt concrete overlay whenever traffic volume is high and pavement&#13;
strength low;&#13;
(ii)   for roads in fair condition (3 &lt; IRI &lt;4.5), asphalt concrete overlays with thickness varying from 3&#13;
to 8 cm were analyzed and compared to surface recycling techniques; and&#13;
(iii)  for roads in poor condition (IRI&gt; 4.5), policies included medium to thick asphalt concrete overlays&#13;
(from 5 to 12 cm), or deep recycling followed by a new wearing course, as well as a complete base&#13;
and wearing course reconstruction.&#13;
7.     The economic benefits of postponing works execution were also analyzed though the adoption of&#13;
condition thresholds triggering execution (area of cracking, or roughness level), or simply by setting the&#13;
year of execution as year 1, year 3, year 5 or year 7. Altogether, twelve maintenance policies were tested,&#13;
namely:&#13;

D. Budget Constraint Levels and Phasing of the Economic Analysis&#13;
8.     During the last ten years, resources for the maintenance and rehabilitation of the federal highway&#13;
network remained consistently in the order of US$100 million and US$350 million respectively, for a total&#13;
network of about 50,000 km. Accordingly, and consistent with past experience and future expectations,&#13;
optimum strategies were defined for a wide and realistic range of budget constraint scenarios likely to occur&#13;
within the next five years. This time, however, a reduced network was considered comprising a total length&#13;
of about 38,000 km of which 29,000 km are to remain under federal jurisdiction, and the remaining 9,000&#13;
km are to be transferred to the States. About 2,500 km which are already under contract and 11,300 km&#13;
pertaining to the concession program were excluded from the analysis. The economic analysis was carried&#13;
out in two phases. In the first phase, the entire 38,000 km long network was analyzed using various&#13;
constraint scenarios for rehabilitation, i.e., US$200, 225, 250, 275, and 300 million per year, over the next&#13;
four to five years. Resources for routine maintenance were kept unconstrained, representing between&#13;
US$80 and 85 million per year (i.e., US$2,100/km/year). This preliminary analysis helped determine the&#13;
optimum global budget level for that network, considering DNER financial constraint. But, in order to&#13;
arrive at a feasible program and an acceptable budget sharing ratio between DNER and state-transferred&#13;
networks, it proved necessary to incorporate the results of the discussions held with the States. The&#13;
negotiations had indeed indicated that decentralization would be successful only if it involved, before the&#13;
devolution, the rehabilitation of about 4,000 km of roads. Thus, the second phase of the analysis aimed at&#13;
determining the amount of resources that would need to be applied to the network to be transferred in order&#13;
to achieve a rehabilitation program involving about 4,000 km of roads. Various pairs of budget constraint&#13;
ratios (DNER/state-transferred networks) - all within the previously determined optimum global budget -&#13;
were tested until a satisfactory solution was obtained.&#13;
E. Strategy Formulation&#13;
9.     Catalog of Structures for Pavement Rehabilitation. The first phase of the economic evaluation&#13;
using the HDM/EBM models with various budget constraint scenarios indicated that the best strategy to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -                                  Annex 2&#13;
applied for the 38,567 km-long network, considering its current maintenance condition and traffic,&#13;
corresponds to US$225 million annually over the next 4 to 5 years (excluding routine maintenance and&#13;
capacity enhancement on the paved network, as well as the maintenance of the unpaved portion of the&#13;
network). The second phase of the economic evaluation indicated that the US$225 million should be best&#13;
shared in the proportion of US$175 million for the 29,335 km long network to remain under federal&#13;
jurisdiction, and US$50 million for the 9,232 km long network to be devolved to the states. Implementing&#13;
this scenario would reduce the proportion of roads in poor condition from the current 10% to 2% in the&#13;
year 2001, and keep that proportion relatively constant during the subsequent ten to fifteen years, provided&#13;
that subsequent annual resource allocations are maintained to a minimum level of about US$175 million.&#13;
The selected strategies for each network can best be represented by the catalog of structures shown in&#13;
Tables 3 and 4 hereafter. The catalogs give the optimum technical solutions to be applied as a function of&#13;
traffic level, pavement surface roughness and pavement structural condition (deflection). They also define&#13;
the maximum average unit cost per km for each solution as well as the most suitable year (between 1 and&#13;
7) in which the execution of the works should take place. As was stated earlier, care will be taken during&#13;
project implementation to ensure that the technical solutions proposed from detailed rehabilitation studies&#13;
do not depart significantly from the standards and costs recommended by the network evaluation study,&#13;
since this would greatly modify the financial evaluation and economic returns of the program (section G).&#13;
10.    Capacity increase.  In addition to defining the most satisfactory structural designs for the&#13;
resurfacing and strengthening of existing pavements, the HDM Model yielded the following guidelines for&#13;
capacity enhancement:&#13;
(i)   the construction of a third lane to upgrade a two-lane bi-directional road is economically justified&#13;
whenever: (a) the traffic level lies in the range of 5,000 to 7,500 vehicles per day, (b) the&#13;
proportion of heavy commercial vehicles exceeds 30%, and (c) the unit cost of the upgrading is less&#13;
than about US$200,000 per km; and&#13;
(ii)   the upgrading of a two-lane road to a dual carriageway is economically feasible whenever: (a) the&#13;
traffic volume in both directions exceed about 8,000 vehicles per day, and (b) the unit cost of&#13;
construction of the second carriageway remains below US$300,000 to US$350,000 per km. For&#13;
much higher unit cost of dualization, traffic thresholds would be substantially higher than 10,000&#13;
vehicles per day.&#13;
Moreover, climbing lanes are justified whenever: (a) the gradient is more than 3%, (b) the volume of&#13;
commercial vehicles exceed 300 per day, and (c) the length of the climbing lane is more than about 300 m.&#13;
11.    Maintenance policy for unpaved roads.&#13;
The strategy for maintaining the 15,000 km of federal    Table 2: Frequency of Grading and Regraveling for&#13;
unpaved roads was based on studies carried out in               Unpaved Roads&#13;
Brazil, using also the HDM model and representative                No. of    Time interval between&#13;
unit costs for routine maintenance, including balding   Average daily traffic  grading/year  regraveling (years)&#13;
and regraveling. The following optimum frequencies  &lt;25              2              7&#13;
of grading and regraveling are recommended as a     25-50            4             6&#13;
50-100          8              5&#13;
function  of average daily traffic. Furthermore,    100-200          1 2            4&#13;
whenever traffic volumes exceed about 300 vehicles  &gt;200            24              3&#13;
per day, consideration should be given to upgrading&#13;
and paving in order to reduce maintenance and&#13;
vehicle operating costs.&#13;

F. Multi-year Rehabilitation Program&#13;
12.    Based on the analyses performed, Table 5 shows for the selected strategy (US$225,000 per year)&#13;
the scope of the five-year program of road investments for the 38,567 km long highway system analyzed&#13;
both in terms of physical targets and total financial needs. The table spells out, year by year, the various&#13;
technical standards to be applied, their respective unit costs, and the lengths of the network over which they&#13;
will be implemented. As can be seen, the overall program is estimated to cost approximately US$1.2&#13;
billion and involves rehabilitation and/or resurfacing works over a cumulated length of 14,150 km, i.e.,&#13;
37% of the total network. About 3,800 km of rehabilitation pertain to the network to be transferred and&#13;
10,350 km belong to the network that will remain under federal jurisdiction. More specifically, the&#13;
program will comprise the execution of about:&#13;
766 km of surface-dressing works, at a cost of about US$ 10 million;&#13;
13,195 km of asphalt concrete overlays, at a cost of US$883 million;&#13;
188 km of reconstruction, at a cost of US$21 million; and&#13;
1,350 km of operational improvement, at a cost of US$120 million;&#13;
Excluding capacity enhancement, the total amount of investments in rehabilitation works would be US$914&#13;
million, i.e., US$225 million annually, and US$65,000/km. Regarding the network intended for concession&#13;
by DNER itself (about 4,000 km), contingency funds will be provided for, in case the concession program&#13;
takes longer to implement than expected. The assessment of the amount to be set aside was based on an&#13;
analysis of the condition of that network. The estimated value for the contingency fund is about US$100&#13;
million, representing the execution of a 3 cm thick asphalt concrete carpet on the portion of that network&#13;
which is in critical condition (about 1,000 km with IRI &gt; 4). This work will help improve riding quality&#13;
and waterproofness.&#13;
G. First-Year Rehabilitation Program&#13;
13.   The first-year program, which is expected to start in late 1997, early 1998, was prepared on the&#13;
basis of the HDM economic evaluation. It represents the highest priority road sections which need&#13;
rehabilitation or resurfacing. The total length of this program is approximately 3,155 km. The program&#13;
would comprise between 40 and 60 homogeneous road segments covering most of the states but&#13;
predominantly the states of Bahia, Goias, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande&#13;
do Sul, and Santa Catarina. About 76% in length are highways that will remain under federal jurisdiction;&#13;
the other 24% would be transferred to the states.&#13;
14.    Detailed engineering studies are presently available for nearly 50% of the first-year program and&#13;
the information was used to prepare rehabilitation designs that are consistent with the recommendations of&#13;
the Catalog of technical solutions and to carry out the economic evaluation. More detailed investigations&#13;
are under way for the remaining 1,500 km, and by June 1997 final designs will be available for the entire&#13;
length of the priority program.&#13;
15.   The 50% sample analyzed thus far, show that the majority of the road segments involved in the&#13;
first-year program were built some 25 years ago and strengthened or resurfaced about 15 years later, i.e.,&#13;
between 1985 and 1988. The pavements mostly consist of flexible structures with asphalt concrete&#13;
surfacing and granular base-course. They presently carry average daily traffic ranging generally between&#13;
2,000 and 5,000 vehicles. Usually cracked over more than 20% of their length, their current roughness&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -                                  Annex 2&#13;
values average almost 7 IRI, reflecting their poor condition. As shown in Table 5, rehabilitation techniques&#13;
generally involve the placing of an asphalt concrete overlay having average thickness of between 4 and 8&#13;
cm, which will increase the pavement structural number to an acceptable figure of more than 4. The need&#13;
for further strengthening or resurfacing is only expected to occur after the next 10 to 15 years of service.&#13;
16.    Table 5 summarizes the main characteristics of the road sections forming part of the first-vear&#13;
program, along with the subproject economic evaluation carried out using the HDM model. For a total&#13;
length of 1,512 km analyzed, the investment cost amounts to approximately US$108 million (giving an&#13;
average unit cost per km of US$71,000). These investments yield intemal economic rates of return (IERR)&#13;
generally ranging between 50% and 250% (averaging 175%) with a total Net Present Value (NPV) of&#13;
US$1.5 billion. Sensitivity analyses showed that a 20% increase in rehabilitation costs or a 20% reduction&#13;
in benefits only marginally affect the IERR and NPV, usually by less than 20%. Rehabilitation costs would&#13;
have to multiplied by a factor of 24 or benefits would have to divided by a factor of 21 in order to reduce&#13;
the NPV to zero.&#13;
17.    The implementation schedule for the first-year federal highway program is shown in Annex 9&#13;
Bidding process is expected to start before July 1997, and works scheduled to begin around October-&#13;
November 1997 are expected to be completed 18 months latcr, i.e., towards the end of 1998.&#13;
H. Routine Maintenance Strategy and Program&#13;
18.    Historical background.  Prior to 1970, the   Evolution of Maintenance Execution Modalities&#13;
routine maintenance of the federal highway system was&#13;
carried out directly by DNER using its own personnel and  100%&#13;
equipment. However, because of the large maintenance&#13;
backlog accumulated over 20 years, as higher priority     Oc&#13;
was given to paving and new  construction, labor   3 60%                 gat&#13;
shortages and insufficient maintenance equipment in the   z  40%&#13;
field residencies made it impossible for DNER to cont'inue      20%)             &#13;
routine  maintenance  exclusively  by  force-account.   0%- _   +       _+    _ _ _ +:_&#13;
Beginning in 1971, in addition to reorganizing and           1965 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995&#13;
structuring a limited core of force-account unit, DNER                  Year&#13;
shifted its policy to maintenance by contract, and, where&#13;
appropriate, to delegation of these activities through&#13;
agreements with State Highway Departments, or exceptionally with the Army.  These efforts were&#13;
supported by the Bank from 1975 onwards. In 1990, the distribution between the three types of&#13;
maintenance were as follows: contract maintenance 60%, delegated maintenance 25%, and force-account&#13;
maintenance 15% of the total length of the federal network.&#13;
19.    Current maintenance policy. To a large extent, the 25 year experience with maintenance by&#13;
contract has been successful, and to-day 80% of the federal system (excluding 13,000 km of earth roads),&#13;
i.e., about 44,000 km, are being maintained through individual three-years contracts with private&#13;
contractors. The maintenance of the remaining 20% portion of the network is delegated to DERs (about&#13;
8,000 km), while the Army maintains some 2,000 km, mainly unpaved roads in the northem part of the&#13;
country. There are currently 250 on-going contracts with the private sector, each contract covering about&#13;
200 km of roads. The activities involved normally comprise drainage, clearing of right-of-ways, shoulder&#13;
repairs, pavement patching and occasionally limited overlay and resurfacing works.  By and large,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46 -                                   Annex 2&#13;
individual contracts amount to approximately US$2 million over a three-year period, representing an&#13;
average cost per km and per year ranging from US$2,500 to US$5,000. The programs are prepared and&#13;
designed by the district residencies, through visual surveys of the road condition and estimates of the&#13;
quantities of works. The districts are also responsible for the supervision and monitoring of the activities&#13;
on site, with some support from DNER head-office personnel.&#13;
20.    Such admeasurement-type contracts, however, are becoming more and more difficult to manage,&#13;
not only in the preparation stage, but also during execution. Items to be quantified and measured for&#13;
payments sometimes reach 200 to 300 in number, and DNER lacks personnel to supervise efficiently the&#13;
quantity and quality of the works performed by the contractors on site. Therefore, there is a growing&#13;
tendency to measure and monitor on a sample basis with all the shortcomings and uncertainties that such a&#13;
system entails. The situation is further compounded by the deficiencies in resource allocations: not only&#13;
maintenance budgets tend to be insufficient, but activities are difficult to plan and program since resources&#13;
are released by the Treasury on an unpredictable basis.&#13;
21.    Proposed future maintenance modalities. The need was therefore felt to go one step further in&#13;
order to improve the system and to ensure better service to road users. Solutions had to be sought to the&#13;
problem of cumbersome measurements and supervision procedures by DNER, while attending the necessity&#13;
to bestow more responsibility and initiative to the contractors. To that effect, DNER has envisaged the&#13;
possibility of adopting performance-type contracts which are already being implemented with success in&#13;
Argentina, enabling to reduce considerably the work-force needed for preparation and supervision, while&#13;
allowing the contractors to be more creative and more directly involved in the design and quality control of&#13;
the maintenance program. One system concerns essentially routine maintenance and applies to roads in&#13;
good to regular condition. The other system, which integrates both rehabilitation and routine maintenance,&#13;
applies to small networks in regular to bad condition, necessitating some prior strengthening or resurfacing&#13;
works before routine maintenance can be effectively carried out. The first system would normally be&#13;
awarded for a period of 5 to 10 years. The contracts would define - not the type and quantities of works to&#13;
be executed and paid on a unit price basis - but rather a level of service to be obtained, as reflected for&#13;
example by the riding quality of the pavement, the presence and efficiency of drainage and safety features,&#13;
or the friendliness of the road immediate environment. Payments would be made on a km/month basis,&#13;
following regular inspections carried out to identify any deficiencies which, unless corrected within a given&#13;
time period, would give rise to penalties, that would be deducted from the payments to be made to the&#13;
contractors.  The integrated rehabilitation/maintenance system  comprises initially a rehabilitation&#13;
component which is paid once executed on a lump-sum basis, provided the final specified results are&#13;
complied with. The rehabilitated network would then be maintained according to the km/month system.&#13;
22.    Pilot Maintenance Program. As part of the proposed project, pilot schemes for performance-&#13;
based contract, comprising the above systems, will be carried out and are intended to be expanded to the&#13;
entire network, when proven successful. The first pilot scheme, the routine maintenance system, will be&#13;
implemented in each of the five regions of the country, and will involve a total network of about 2,000 km,&#13;
comprising individual sub-networks with length varying between 100 and 200 km each. These sub-&#13;
networks are currently being identified and surveyed by the district engineers and a technical assistance was&#13;
contracted to prepare bidding documents (including technical specifications), help evaluate proposals and&#13;
train DNER personnel in the monitoring of the program. It is expected that tendering would take place in&#13;
the third quarter of 1997, and works would start in late 1997. The second pilot scheme, the integrated&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance system, will be developed and implemented once the first one is in operation,&#13;
and is therefore scheduled to begin in 1998.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Federal Highway Decentralization Program&#13;
1.    The 1988 Constitutional reform decentralized fiscal revenues and transferred all road user&#13;
charges to States and Municipalities without changing in parallel the distribution of responsibilities&#13;
among the three administrative levels. The federation was therefore left with a disproportionate share&#13;
of functional and financial responsibility, which became more and more difficult to assume as DNER's&#13;
annual budgets dramatically decreased from about US$3 billion to a current figure of about US$1&#13;
billion. The average annual expenditure of US$250 to US$300 million incurred over the last five&#13;
years for rehabilitation and maintenance is substantially below the level of resource allocations required&#13;
to properly maintain, strengthen and upgrade the 69,000 km forming the federal network. On the&#13;
other hand, most state governments would now accept to assume responsibility of part of the federal&#13;
network providing they receive either the funds needed for necessary rehabilitation works, if any, or&#13;
the roads in good condition.  In order to correct the imbalance between highway revenues and&#13;
expenditure responsibilities at the federal and state levels, it became obvious that the solution was to&#13;
reduce the size of the network under federal jurisdiction, devolving to the States all roads which are&#13;
not of national interest, while embarking simultaneously on a concession program which involves the&#13;
participation of the private sector.&#13;
2.     To that effect, and over the last five years, the Ministry of Transport has been actively&#13;
working at redefining the configuration of the road network that should remain under federal&#13;
jurisdiction. The criteria used to define the highways of national interest which would become the new&#13;
federal system were five-fold : (i) they connect the states' capitals and thus contribute to national&#13;
integration; (ii) they provide connections to other major modes of transport; (iii) they establish inter-&#13;
regional links; (iv) they ensure and fulfill national defense and safety purposes; and (v) they promote&#13;
international connections with neighboring countries. Based on these criteria, a new national highway&#13;
system was drafted in early 1995, which included a preliminary definition of the highways that would&#13;
remain federal and those which could be devolved to the states.&#13;
3.    Following the preliminary definition of the proposed new  national highway system, the&#13;
Ministry of Transport initiated in June 1995 intense negotiations with the state administrations and by&#13;
September 1995 arrived at a consensus regarding the proposed reclassification.  It was confirmed&#13;
during the negotiations that only highways in good condition, through rehabilitation when necessary,&#13;
would be transferred to the states. Draft legislation that would formalize the proposed reclassification&#13;
was then prepared and sent to the Congress on October 31, 1995. The configuration of the new federal&#13;
system sent for approval to Congress comprised approximately:&#13;
highways linking the states' capitals (17,200 km);&#13;
highways providing connections to other major modes of transport (4,100 km);&#13;
highways establishing inter-regional connections (13,800 km);&#13;
highways ensuring national defense purposes (1,000 km); and&#13;
highways promoting international connections (6,300 km).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4.       Altogether, the proposed reclassification contemplates the devolution of about 17,500 km  to the&#13;
states, of which 12,500 km are paved. The new federal system which would incorporate also some&#13;
roads previously under state jurisdictions, would consist of about 50,000 km, of which 40,000 km are&#13;
paved and 10,000 km, essentially in the Northern region, are unpaved (Table 1). The total length of&#13;
the federal network would therefore be reduced by about 26%. If one also considers the concession&#13;
program, which aims to transfer about 10,000 km to private operators, DNER's network responsibility&#13;
would be reduced by a total of about 40%.&#13;

5.       The four states Minas Gerais, Rio  Grande do Sul, Parana, and  Bahia would  receive about&#13;
10,320 km, accounting for 60% of the total transfer. Individually, they would be transfered between&#13;
1,500 km and 4.800 km, representing between 13% and 28% of the total state networks under their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -                                   Annex 3&#13;
responsibility. In order to alleviate the impact of such transfers, the four states have prepared and&#13;
undertaken plans to concession a significant portion of the highways to be transferred, together with&#13;
state highways and sections which will remain under federal jurisdiction. The Federal Government has&#13;
recently delegated many of these highways to the states in order to enable them to invite bids for&#13;
concessions (Annex 4, section C). Of the remaining states, a group of about half would receive&#13;
between 300 and 600 km each, the other half receiving less than 200 km.&#13;
6.     The Transport Commission of Congress prepared an alternative proposal which consists of&#13;
distributing the federal network into two distinct networks: a "Rinter" network (Rede Interestadual e&#13;
Internacional de Estradas de Rodagem) which corresponds to the main inter-state, inter-regional and&#13;
international networks, and a "Complementary" system. The former would constitute the new federal&#13;
highway system to remain under federal jurisdiction, part of which may be either delegated to states&#13;
administrations or concessioned to the private sector. The total length of Rinter network, including&#13;
highways to be tendered out for concessions, is about 43,100 km of which 33,300 km are paved. The&#13;
proposed federal network would include inter-state highways (30,300 km), inter-regional connections&#13;
(5,300 km), and international links (7,500 km). The complementary network, totaling about 26,200&#13;
km (of which 18,000 km are paved) would still be administered by M.T./DNER, preferably through&#13;
delegations to States, Municipalities or the Federal district, until the final transfer occurs by agreement&#13;
between the Federal and the State Governments. Delegation to States or Municipalities would give&#13;
them also the right to either concession the highways or to directly recover tolls, the proceeds of which&#13;
would be used to maintain these highways and possibly adjacent feeder roads. The proposal has been&#13;
approved by the relevant commissions of the Congress and is expected to be presented to the Chamber&#13;
of Deputies and the Senate for final votes in the near future.&#13;
7.     Pending approval by the Congress of the new federal highway system, and in accordance with&#13;
the spirit of the draft legislation, a transitional step is being taken to initiate and speed up the&#13;
decentralization process. It entails the signing of decentralization agreements or protocols of intention&#13;
between the Ministry of Transport and the State Governments, aimed at defining the highway segments&#13;
to be transferred and the respective responsibilities of DNER and the states for the execution and&#13;
funding of the rehabilitation works and future maintenance of these highway segments. Four highway&#13;
decentralization agreements have been signed with the states of Parana, Rio Grande do Sul. Minas&#13;
Gerais and Bahia.  The agreements specify that responsibilities for the selected highway sections&#13;
would be transferred when the SNV Law is approved, or, for those sections which require&#13;
rehabilitation, after the completion of the works. In the event the SNV Law is not approved, the state&#13;
is committed to assume operation and maintenance responsibility for a period of at least ten years. The&#13;
Ministry of Transport has also delegated federal highway sections to the states of Parana, Rio Grande&#13;
do Sul, and Santa Catarina for their concessioning by the states (Annex 4).&#13;
8      The Federal and the state govermnents have agreed, in order to minimize the impact of the transfers&#13;
on the states' expenditure responsibilities, that highways would be transferred in good condition or that the&#13;
Federal Government would provide the resources necessary to rehabilitate those in poor condition. The&#13;
Ministry of Transport has negotiated and would enter into highway decentralization agreements with all&#13;
participating states in order to specify the respective responsibilities of the Federal and state governments&#13;
for the execution and financing of such rehabilitation works. DNER has negotiated and would enter into&#13;
delegation agreements with seven states (Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Goias,&#13;
Bahia and Ceara) to delegate the execution of the rehabilitation works within agreed technical and financial&#13;
parameters. These seven states were selected on the basis of the size of the rehabilitation program in the&#13;
state and the capacity of the DER to implement it. The proposed project would assist the federal and the&#13;
state governments in effectively implementing such agreements.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Federal Highway Concession Program&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    In 1994, the Federal Government and DNER initiated the preparation of a highway concession&#13;
program. The objectives were to transfer the management and financing of existing federal highways&#13;
to private investors. A special concession unit was created within DNER to: (i) develop a consistent&#13;
program; (ii) analyse priority projects; and (ii) prepare tender documents and invite and evaluate bids;&#13;
In February 1995, the Congress passed a Concession Law, which specifies the procedures and criteria&#13;
for transferring public facilities and services, including highways, to private concessionaires. In the&#13;
course of 1995, DNER implemented the first phase of the program, which consisted of four highway&#13;
sections and the Rio-Niteroi bridge, which had already been tolled in the past (Table 1). All of them&#13;
required substantial initial rehabilitation works. The Rio - Sao Paulo, Dutra highway also required&#13;
additional capacity investments. All the five concessions, which total about 850 km in length, have&#13;
been contracted and are presently in operation (section B). On the basis of the experience with the first&#13;
phase, DNER initiated the preparation of the second phase of the concession program, which would&#13;
involve some 10,000 km of existing federal highways (sections C and D).&#13;
2.    In September 1996, however, the Congress passed another law (the Delegation Law), which&#13;
authorizes the Federal Government to delegate federal highways and other public infrastructure&#13;
facilities to states and municipalities for their subsequent concessioning. On the basis of this law,&#13;
some state governments, including Rio Grande do Sul, Parana, Santa Catarina and Minas Gerais, have&#13;
started developing and implementing highway concession programs, which combine both federal and&#13;
state highways. The Ministry of Transport, in line with the Government's decentralization objective,&#13;
and on the basis of the recent Delegation Law, has delegated federal highway sections totaling about&#13;
4,500 km to the first three states for concessioning. Negotiations are still underway with the state of&#13;
Minas Gerais for further delegations. DNER will be responsible for concessioning the remaining&#13;
highways sections included in the program, and for monitoring the concessioning of the delegated&#13;
highways (section E).  Other states, including Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, have prepared or&#13;
undertaken concession programs which essentially involve state highways.&#13;
3.    The DNER and the state programs have the same objectives: increasing road cost recovery&#13;
through tolls, and improving highway management through the private sector. Private concessionaires&#13;
would operate, rehabilitate and maintain the highways, and, in some cases, carry out and finance&#13;
investments, and would recover these costs from road users through tolls.  The governments or&#13;
highway agencies remain responsible for identifying candidate highways, defining initial works and&#13;
maintenance standards, calling for bids and evaluating proposals from prequalified investors, as well as&#13;
for supervising the concession contracts.  But the bidding procedures and bid evaluation criteria vary&#13;
from state to state. As an example, DNER has awarded the concessions to the pre-qualified bidders&#13;
who offered the lowest toll rates. Other criteria used are the highest price for the concession (state of&#13;
Sao Paulo) or the longest section of highway maintained (state of Rio Grande do Sul), both for a toll&#13;
rate set by the state.&#13;
&#13;

B. Experience with the First Phase of the DNER Program&#13;
4.      DNER has completed the first phase of the program, which consisted of concessioning five&#13;
highway sections totaling about 850 km, including the Niteroi Bridge, the Dutra - Rio de Janeiro - Sao&#13;
Paulo highway, the Osorio - Porto Alegre highway, the Alem Paraiba-Teresopolis highway, and the&#13;
Juiz de Fora-Petropolis-Rio de Janeiro highway, which were already tolled in the past. The total&#13;
inivestments required on these five sections are estimated at about US$1.3 billion equivalent over the&#13;
concession period (Table 1).&#13;

Dutra Highway&#13;
5.      This first phase of the program suffered delays due to litigation by unsuccessful bidders and to&#13;
the unavailability of long-term private debt finance in Brazil. Four concessions are now in operation.&#13;
T'he Osorio - Porto Alegre concession has been suspended due to the financial difficulties of the&#13;
winning bidder. Although the success of a highway concession can only be assessed several years&#13;
after its opening to traffic, the following lessons have been learned from this first experience:&#13;
(a)  the financial analyses performed did not take into account the lack of long-term private finance&#13;
in Brazil, and the bidders were not requested to provide a thorough justification for their&#13;
financial proposals;&#13;
(b)   since concessionaires have been unable to secure private debt financing, except for small loans&#13;
guaranteed by the sponsors and for a relatively small IFC B loan currently being finalized for&#13;
the Dutra highway, the National Bank for Social and Economic Development (BNDES) had to&#13;
provide most of the necessary debt financing;&#13;
(c)   since the above sources of funds are limited, future concessions will have to be financed on a&#13;
limited recourse basis, and therefore to attract long term debt domestically and/or&#13;
internationally which, in certain cases, will require appropriate guarantees and effective&#13;
promotion;&#13;
(d)  the concessionaires selected are essentially civil works contractors, with the risk that they may&#13;
not be willing to operate the toll road during the entire concession period, after the main works&#13;
have been completed;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                             Annex 4&#13;
(e) the concession contracts include detailed specifications for the works and services to be&#13;
provided by the concessionaire, which would require efficient control mechanisms; but DNER&#13;
has not yet organized its newly-created Concession Department to effectively supervise the&#13;
technical, financial, and operational aspects of the concessions.&#13;
6.    As a result of the above difficulties to secure private financing for toll roads, the Government&#13;
decided to dualize two important highways (Belo Horizonte - Sao Paulo, 450 km, and Sao Paulo -&#13;
Curitiba - Florianopolis, 250 km) with public funds and borrowings from the IDB, for subsequent&#13;
concessioning to private operators.&#13;
C. Proposed Federal Highway Concession Program&#13;
7.    The experience developed under the first phase is being incorporated into the preparation of the&#13;
subsequent phases of the program; in particular with regard to the selection of the highway sections for&#13;
concessioning, and to the sharing of the various risks between the Government and the concessionaires.&#13;
8.    A consulting firm has been appointed to analyze the entire federal highway network and to&#13;
identify the highways which could be concessioned on the basis of sound technical, economic and&#13;
financial criteria. The necessary rehabilitation and maintenance works and capacity investments were&#13;
estimated on the basis of the results of the network condition and traffic surveys. The economic&#13;
evaluation was conducted using the Bank's HDM III model. The financial analysis led to preliminary&#13;
estimates of the financial rates of return on the sponsors' equity contributions for each of the proposed&#13;
concessions. These analyses were used to prepare a priority list of highway sections, totaling about&#13;
12,000 km, for which concessioning was found to be feasible.&#13;
9.    In line with the Federal Government's decentralization objective, and on the basis of the&#13;
recently-approved Delegation Law, the Ministry of Transport decided to delegate the responsibility for&#13;
concessioning federal highways to those state governments which have adequate capabilities. It is&#13;
expected that, by combining federal highway sections with state highway sections, the state&#13;
governments could offer more efficient and attractive concession packages.  Such delegation&#13;
agreements have already been signed with the states of Parana, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina.&#13;
The total length of the sections delegated to the three states is about 5,000 km. Negotiations are still&#13;
underway with the state of Minas Gerais, which could lead to the delegation of a number of sections&#13;
totalling up to 3,000 km.&#13;
(a)    Santa Catarina State Concession Program&#13;
10.   The state of Santa Catarina has prepared a highway concession program, which consists of&#13;
concessioning five networks totalling about 1,470 km, of which about 520 km are federal highways&#13;
and 950 km are state highways. The Ministry of Transport has delegated to the state two highway&#13;
sections totalling about 520 km (Table 2).&#13;

11.    The state of Parana has prepared a highway concession program, which consists of&#13;
concessioning a network of about 2,030 km, of which about 1,680 km are federal highways and 350&#13;
kmn are state highways. The Ministry of Transport has delegated to the state 14 highway sections&#13;
totalling about 1,786 km (Table 3).&#13;

(b)    Rio Grande do Sul State Concession Program&#13;
12.    The state of Rio Grande do Sul has prepared a highway concession program, which consists of&#13;
concessioning nine separate networks around nine regional centers. The studies have been completed&#13;
and the bidding process is at the pre-qualification stage. The concessions would be awarded to the pre-&#13;
qualified bidders who offer to take the longest networks for a pre-established toll rate. It is expected&#13;
that the aggregated length of the nine networks will exceed 3,000 km. The Ministry of Transport has&#13;
delegated to the state 11 highway sections totalling about 2,771 km (Table 4).&#13;

(d)    DNER Concession Program&#13;
13.   The federal highway sections which are not, or will not be, delegated to state goverments,&#13;
would be concessioned directly by DNER. On the basis of the pre-feasibility study, 16 sections&#13;
totalling about 3,900 km could possibly be concessioned (Table 5). Detailed studies, however, still&#13;
need to be carried out in order to confirm the feasibility of the proposed concessions. DNER is in the&#13;
process of contracting such studies for a first group of nine highway sections totalling about 2,150 km,&#13;
which would constitute the second phase. The terms of reference for the studies, including the&#13;
engineering, traffic, economic, financial, and environmental analyses, have been reviewed and found&#13;
satisfactory by the appraisal mission. The project would include consultant services to carry out these&#13;
studies. It is expected that the studies of the first phase would be completed by the end of 1997 and&#13;
those of the second phase by the end of 1998. The bidding process would take place in 1998 and 1999&#13;
respectively.&#13;

Preliminary estimates based on pre-feasibility analysis&#13;
14.    On the highway sections which require essentially rehabilitation and maintenance works, the&#13;
program of works can generally be phased so that they can be substantially financed through toll&#13;
revenues. In these cases, debt financing requirements are minimal; therefore, in spite of the lack of&#13;
long-term debt financing in Brazil, it is expected that these concessions will attract interest on the part&#13;
of investors and contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                              Annex 4&#13;
15.   On the highway sections which require substantial initial investments, such as a complete&#13;
reconstruction of the pavement, additional lanes or dualization, the concession documents will be&#13;
designed with a view to facilitate private financing.  In particular, the methodologies for traffic&#13;
analyses and forecasts, and the computer model for financial analyses, will be refined. Improved&#13;
mechanisms would be developed and some form of guarantees would be offered for toll adjustments&#13;
with inflation, servicing of foreign debts, repatriation of dividends, and non-judicial resolution of&#13;
disputes. DNER is also preparing for broader communication and marketing efforts to disseminate the&#13;
program, with a view to attracting interest from international investors and financiers, and to&#13;
increasing competition.&#13;
16.   The Government has shown interest in the Bank's guarantee program, and it was agreed that,&#13;
at the request of the Government, the Bank would assess the feasibility of partial risk guarantees on&#13;
loans to concessionaires for specific highway concessions which, because of the risks involved, would&#13;
not be attractive without such Bank guarantees. One or two pilot projects will be selected on the basis&#13;
of the results of the feasibility studies, and the Bank would make a separate evaluation of these projects&#13;
for possible guarantee operations.&#13;
D. Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
17.   In order to implement the highway concession program  and to supervise the highway&#13;
concessions, DNER has recently established a Concession Department, headed by a Director who&#13;
reports directly to the Director-General (Chart 1, Annex 10). The department is responsible for all&#13;
activities related to highway concessions, including planning, studies, development, procurement and&#13;
supervision. The supervision of the concession contracts would be delegated to DNER's relevant&#13;
districts. The DERs of Santa Catarina, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul, have established concession&#13;
units with similar responsibilities. The proposed project would include technical assistance from an&#13;
international specialist firm and staff training to help DNER organize and strengthen the new&#13;
Concession Department and establish adequate concession supervision capabilities in the relevant&#13;
DNER districts in order to implement the concession program efficiently. Technical assistance and&#13;
training services would also be offered to the DERs which are preparing and/or implementing&#13;
concession programs which include delegated highways.&#13;
18.   The scope of the technical assistance would be to:&#13;
(a)    advise on the traffic studies, financial analyses, and appropriate financial structures to&#13;
ensure the attractiveness of the concession projects to private sponsors and financial&#13;
institutions, including the development of an adequate computerized financial model&#13;
which would be used to evaluate bidders' proposals;&#13;
(b)    help prepare appropriate concession documents and the related bidding documents to&#13;
ensure an efficient distribution of the risks between the Government, the sponsors and&#13;
the financial institutions;&#13;
(c)    prepare a marketing plan, including documentation to disseminate the program and&#13;
specific projects, identify potential sponsors and financiers, and organize appropriate&#13;
series of meetings and road shows;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                               Annex 4&#13;
(d)    assist in the evaluation of bids, particularly in the feasibility of the proposed financial&#13;
structures, and in award decisions;&#13;
(e)    recommend appropriate communications policies vis-a-vis road users, and help&#13;
organize public meetings and hearings;&#13;
(f)    organize the units responsible for the supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the&#13;
concession contracts, prepare relevant manuals, and train supervision, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation staff;&#13;
(g)    recommend effective dispute resolution mechanisms;&#13;
(h)    review the environmental analyses of specific concession projects, and advise on&#13;
appropriate distribution of environmental responsibilities; and&#13;
(i)    prepare and help coordinate a training program for DNER and DER concession staff,&#13;
particularly in the areas of: financial analyses and project finance; procurement and&#13;
legal issues; environmental management and supervision; communications and public&#13;
relations; supervision and auditing; monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
19.    Estimates of specialist-month and budget requirements for the technical assistance and training&#13;
components are shown in the project cost and financing table (Annex 8, Table 2).&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Management Plan&#13;
A. Environmental Management Capacities&#13;
1.     DNER has established an Environmental Unit in its Engineering Department as a condition of&#13;
the recently-completed Highway Management and Rehabilitation Project (Loan No. 3169-BR). The&#13;
unit is responsible for developing appropriate environmental norms and instructions and for&#13;
supervising their implementation. The unit is now comprised of one economist and three engineers,&#13;
who have received appropriate training and are now fully operational.&#13;
2.      The unit, with technical assistance financed under the above-mentioned project or other&#13;
sources, has carried out the following agreed tasks:&#13;
(a)  preparation of a manual of Environmental Norms and Instructions: Corpo Normativo&#13;
Ambientalpara Enpreendimentos Rodoviarios (para. 4);&#13;
(b)  preparation of a computerized Environmental Management System, which consists of a&#13;
database of environment-related information;&#13;
(c)  environmental assessments for major improvement projects, including the Sao Paulo -&#13;
Florian6polis highway, the BR-174 Manaus-Boa Vista highway, and the BR 040/MG Belo&#13;
Horizonte-Sete Lagoas highway;&#13;
(d)  preparation of a Pilot Plan for the Rehabilitation of Environmental Degradations resulting&#13;
from road works in the State of Rio de Janeiro, and related Manual of Instructions to address&#13;
the most frequent degradations;&#13;
(e)  ex-post evaluation of the Engineering Design of BR 101/ RJ/SP highway between Rio de&#13;
Janeiro and Ubatuba, identifying the environmental management deficiencies at the planning,&#13;
design, and constrution stages;&#13;
(f)  evaluation of land use in right-of-ways and in their vicinity, identification of related problems&#13;
such as fires, urban crossings, invasions, etc., and recommendation of solutions, including&#13;
resettlement of population; and&#13;
(g)  environmental audits of specific engineering designs and construction works.&#13;
3.      More recently, the unit had initiated the following additional tasks:&#13;
(a)   ex-post environmental impact assessment of the BR 163/MT/PA Cuiaba-Santarem highway,&#13;
aiming at verifying the changes, especially migrations and economic activities that occurred&#13;
in the area of influence after the construction of the road sections in the 1960s and 1970s. The&#13;
results of this work and of the above-mentioned BR 101 Rio de Janeiro - Ubatuba study will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -                                Annex 5&#13;
help develop a detailed methodology for incorporating environmental impact assessments in&#13;
the economic evaluation of future highway improvement projects; and&#13;
(b)  specific environmental studies and supervision of the implementation of the environmental&#13;
measures on many highway sections such as BR 226/CE, Jaguaribe-Senador Pompeu, and BR-&#13;
050/MG (near Uberlandia).&#13;
4.      DNER's manual of Environmental Norms and Instructions (Corpo Normativo Ambiental para&#13;
Enpreendimentos Rodoviarios), which was prepared by the Environmental Unit, and approved by&#13;
DNER Administrative Council through Resolution No. 126/96, is now in effect. The Manual includes&#13;
Environmental Guidelines (Escopo Basico) for road projects and ten specific Environmental&#13;
Instructions (ISAs), which are now incorporated into all bidding documents and contracts for road&#13;
engineering and works.  These instructions cover all the phases of the highway projects, and&#13;
particularly:&#13;
(a)  preliminary environmental impact assessments at the planning stage;&#13;
(b)  analyses of alternative aligmnents;&#13;
(c)  environmental impact assessments (EIAs);&#13;
(d)  environmental impact reports (RIMAs);&#13;
(e)  preparation of the Environmental Management Plan;&#13;
(f)  environmental impacts at the design stage: identification, prevention and mitigation;&#13;
(g)  environmental impacts at the construction stage: identification, prevention and mitigation;&#13;
(h)  environmental impacts at the operation stage;&#13;
(i)  environmental rehabilitation projects; and&#13;
(j)  environmental supervision of road works.&#13;
5.      The manual was prepared with technical assistance under the recently-completed Highway&#13;
Management and Rehabilitation Project. The Bank supervision team closely supervised the preparation&#13;
of the manual; the appraisal mission reviewed the document and found it adequate to ensure an&#13;
effective environmental management and supervision of highway projects, including the proposed&#13;
project. The Bank team also supervised the other tasks carried out by the environmental unit under the&#13;
recent project, and found that the unit has now the capacity to effectively implement its&#13;
responsibilities. However, considering the size of the proposed project, the project management&#13;
consultant would provide technical assistance to the project management team and to the environmental&#13;
unit in carrying out the environmental management plan (section B).&#13;
6.    The environmental management performance of the DERs is still mixed. Many DERs do not&#13;
have yet appropriate environmental norms or guidelines nor a capacity to implement them. But the&#13;
seven DERs participating in the project, which have benefited from Bank or IDB-financed projects,&#13;
have already established an institutional capacity to analyze the environmental impacts of their projects,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                                Annex 5&#13;
take them into account at the planning and design stages, and effectively implement the necessary&#13;
prevention or mitigatory measures. Under the project, they will be required to adopt DNER's manual&#13;
of environmental norms and instructions or equivalent, and to strengthen their environmental units and&#13;
procedures as necessary to effectively supervise the implementation of such norms and instructions.&#13;
The terms of the contracts for highway engineering, road works and concessions would specify the&#13;
environmental responsibilities of the consultants, contractors, concessionaires and DNER or the DER,&#13;
with approporiate references to the manual of environmental norms and instructions.   The&#13;
environmental units of DNER and the DERs, and the Project Management Consultant would carry out&#13;
appropriate supervision.  In particular, the project would help implement the necessary surveys,&#13;
designs and works under the rehabilitation subprojects to repair and prevent road-related environmental&#13;
degradation (section B).&#13;
B. Enviromnental Management Plan&#13;
7.    The project works consists essentially of the rehabilitation and resurfacing of existing paved&#13;
highways, and of localized operational and safety improvements and environmental rehabilitation&#13;
works. The rehabilitation and resurfacing works are related to the existing platform of the highway,&#13;
mostly to the pavement. The operational and safety improvement works will consist of widening lanes&#13;
and shoulders (in particular climbing lanes), strengthening or widening of bridges, improvement of&#13;
curves and intersections, and vertical and horizontal signalization. The environmental rehabilitation&#13;
works will consist mainly of correcting drainage systems to avoid uncontrolled erosions, and in&#13;
rehabilitating already degraded areas. Because of the budget constraints, however, only those works&#13;
necessary to avoid the further degradation of the highway platform will be implemented.&#13;
8.    The possible adverse effects of the maintenance and rehabilitation components are limited to&#13;
those resulting from quarrying, borrow pits, or the disposal of used pavement materials. The&#13;
operational and safety improvements, especially those planned in sensitive, either high population&#13;
density areas or mountainous terrain, could have adverse impacts, respectively on the people living&#13;
close to the highway or on slope erosion. Also, in the past, many highways were built without&#13;
adequate attention to the environment. The resulting environmental liabilities, which generally consist&#13;
of uncontrolled erosions, adversely affect the highway structure or right-of-way, and sometimes&#13;
adjacent properties.&#13;
9.    In order to effectively prevent or mitigate such adverse impacts, DNER has prepared and&#13;
would implement an environmental management plan. DNER has put into effect the above-mentioned&#13;
manual of environmental norms and instructions for road engineering and works. The seven&#13;
participating DERs will be required, through the delegation agreements, to adopt the DNER manual of&#13;
environmental norms and instructions or equivalent for all the investments under the project.&#13;
10.   At the planning and design stage, the engineering consultants have been required, and will be&#13;
required in the future, to follow the relevant Environmental Instructions. In particular, the agreed,&#13;
standard terms of reference for subproject field surveys and studies, which are included in the&#13;
Operational Manual, and the relevant Environmental Instructions incorporate appropriate screening&#13;
criteria and requirements to effectively prevent, correct or mitigate such adverse impacts. Adequate&#13;
supervision and control will be carried out by DNER and the DERs' environmental units, and by the&#13;
project management consultant. Summaries of these studies, including environmental analyses, in an&#13;
agreed format will be reviewed by the Bank prior to authorizing the financing of specific investments&#13;
under the loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                                  Annex 5&#13;
11.   The terms of reference for subproject designs specifically require the subproject engineeering&#13;
consultants to survey all existing degradations in the right-of-way and adjacent areas resulting from&#13;
past road works. The environmental data collected by the consultants, including existing and potential&#13;
degradations, will be incorporated into DNER environmental database, and be used in the preparation&#13;
of future plans and programs. The consultants are also required to incorporate the design of the&#13;
subproject the necessary corrective works to rehabilitate such degraded areas and to prevent future&#13;
degradations. However, considering the budget constraints, the environmental rehabilitation works&#13;
will be limited to those which are essential to prevent further degradations which, in the long term,&#13;
could affect the structure of the highway. On the basis of the studies of the first-year program, which&#13;
have been completed, reviewed by the appraisal mission, and found satisfactory, the cost of&#13;
environmental rehabilitation works was estimated, as an average, at about 5 percent of the total&#13;
subproject cost.&#13;
12.   The highway concession projects being prepared by DNER  are also subject to the&#13;
environmental management plan. The terms of reference for the engineering consultants who are&#13;
responsible for preparing the preliminary designs of the works and the bidding documents for the&#13;
concessions, include specific requirements for field surveys to identify existing and potential&#13;
environmental degradations, and for designing appropriate corrective and prevention measures or&#13;
works. The bidding documents and the concession contracts will include the relevant Environmental&#13;
Instructions of DNER, and will specify the respective responsiblities for implementing the specific&#13;
corrective and prevention works included in the concession.&#13;
13.   At the construction stage, appropriate norms and specifications will be incorporated in the&#13;
bidding documents and contracts for civil works, including the relevant Environmental Instructions and&#13;
the detailed specifications for the environmental prevention measures or works.  Payments to&#13;
contractors will be subject to compliance with the Environmental Instructions. The agreed standard&#13;
terms of reference for the supervision consultants, which are included in the Operational Manual,&#13;
specify the environmental supervision requirements.   DNER and the DERs environmental units,&#13;
assisted by the project management consultant, will exercise adequate control through field inspections&#13;
in order to ensure that the environmental clauses of the contracts for works and supervision are&#13;
complied with.&#13;
14.   Technical assistance and staff training services will be provided to DNER  and to the&#13;
participating DERs in order to effectively implement and supervise the above-mentioned environmental&#13;
requirements (Annex 6).&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Capacity Analysis and Technical Assistance&#13;
A. Assessment of DNER's Institutional Capacity&#13;
1.    DNER's institutional capacity analyses were initiated as far back as 1988 , prompted by two major&#13;
factors: first, the constitutional reform which decentralized fiscal revenues, drastically curtailing DNER&#13;
budgetary resources and forcing the agency to revise and reduce the scope of its road activities; second, the&#13;
policy shift in emphasis away from new works and expansion of the federal highway network to the more&#13;
relevant activities of maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing assets. DNER appointed a Consulting&#13;
firm to make a comprehensive analysis of its institutional capacity gaps, and to recommend institutional&#13;
reform and strengthening measures required in the new context of maintaining the existing network to an&#13;
adequate level of service under more constrained financial resources. On the basis of these analyses, the&#13;
Consultant identified the major institutional weaknesses of the institution and recommended a plan for&#13;
reform and institutional strengthening in order to achieve the newly defined role and objectives of DNER.&#13;
Taking into account the results and recommendations of the Consultant's assessment, a number of positive&#13;
reforms were implemented such as the contracting of all maintenance activities to the private sector, the&#13;
transfer of the police function on the federal highways and related staff to the Ministry of Justice, the&#13;
reduction of staff through early retirement, and the merging of the former Maintenance and Construction&#13;
Departments into one Department of Highway Engineering. Despite these positive actions, DNER's&#13;
current organization still reflects its past objectives and requires further reforms.&#13;
2.     The enactment in February 1995 of the concession law, and the Government's decisions to&#13;
concession the highway sections that are susceptible to attract private management and financing, and to&#13;
devolve to the states the responsibilities for a substantial portion (nearly 30%) of the federal network that is&#13;
not of national interest, will have two effects: (i) to reduce the scope of DNER's direct operation and&#13;
maintenance responsibilities on the federal network by almost 40%, as well as the Federal Government's&#13;
expenditure responsibilities; and (ii) to increase DNER's responsibilities for regulating, supervising and&#13;
monitoring the concession and decentralization programs. On this basis, DNER started to redesign its&#13;
administrative and organizational structure with technical assistance financed under the recently-completed&#13;
Federal Highway Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3169-BR). In redefining DNER's mission and objectives,&#13;
the consultant helped diagnose its current institutional deficiencies and recommended measures to&#13;
strengthen the specific functions and processes needed to effectively implement the proposed Federal&#13;
Highway Rehabilitation and Decentralization project.&#13;
3.     The institutional capacity gaps, and thus the needs for capacity building, were identified as follows:&#13;
(i) lack of coordination between DNER and the various ministries involved in the definition, funding&#13;
and implementation of highway transport policies and programs; this issue was addressed by the&#13;
recent reform of DNER's Administrative Council, which now includes representatives of the&#13;
Ministries of Planning, Finance and Transport;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                                 Annex 6&#13;
(ii)  insufficient network monitoring and work programming and budgeting capacity; DNER still needs&#13;
to organize systematic surveys of surface and structural condition, traffic and accidents, and to&#13;
strengthen its network database and its planning, programming, costing and budgeting processes to&#13;
prepare coherent annual and pluriannual investment and maintenance programs and budget&#13;
proposals;&#13;
(iii)  deficient contract supervision and quality control often resulting in substantial delays and cost&#13;
overruns: hence the need to strengthen its capacity to inspect, audit and monitor the works, and to&#13;
reevaluate its methodologies and forms of contracts, including shifting from traditional line-item or&#13;
quantity and unit price contracts to more efficient performance or results-based contracts;&#13;
(iv)  insufficient technical capacity and resources to prepare highway concession projects attractive to&#13;
the private sector; hence the recent creation of the Concession Department and the concession&#13;
technical assistance and training component of the project;&#13;
(v)  insufficient technical capacity to adequately supervise and monitor the concession contracts or the&#13;
new forms of maintenance management contracts; and the consequent need to strengthen the&#13;
regional districts' concession supervision and monitoring capacity to ensure that the quality&#13;
standards of the contracts are complied with;&#13;
(vi)  insufficient capacity to supervise the preparation of final engineering designs and to ensure that&#13;
consultant recommendations are consistent with the technical solutions derived from economic&#13;
analyses incorporating budget constraints, and with other agreed policies and standards for&#13;
operational and safety improvements and environmental rehabilitation works;&#13;
(vii)  deficiencies in the preparation and carrying out of experimental and applied research programs;&#13;
DNER needs to seek innovative and cost-effective technologies responding to pressing issues and&#13;
problems encountered at design, construction, or maintenance stages;&#13;
(viii)  lack of management stability within the technical and operational departments due to high turnover&#13;
arising from changes in government: hence the need to separate the politically appointed layers of&#13;
management, most susceptible to changes, from what should be a more permanent core of technical&#13;
staff.&#13;
4.    In order to remedy the above deficiencies and to strengthen DNER's capacity to implement the&#13;
proposed project and to achieve its objectives, DNER has established a Project Management Unit, headed&#13;
by a Project Manager who reports directly to the Director General, and a Project Coordinating Committee,&#13;
including the Directors of all the departments involved.  The project includes a technical assistance&#13;
component, which consists of the assignment of: (a) a specialized Project Management Consultant (PMC)&#13;
to assist the PMU and the departments concerned in the coordination, supervision and monitoring of the&#13;
project; and (b) a specialized Highway Concession Consultant to assist the Concession Department in&#13;
preparing and monitoring the concession program.&#13;
B. Project Management Unit&#13;
5.    In order to ensure adequate management of the project, a Project Coordinating Committee (PCC)&#13;
was established in January 1997, through a resolution of DNER's General Director. Also, a Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                                 Annex 6&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) was created. The PCC includes the Directors of the Departments involved in the&#13;
project and is responsible for effective inter-departmental coordination. The PMU is headed by the Chief of&#13;
the Planning Division (Assessoria de Planejamento), who is directly subordinated to the Director-General.&#13;
The mission assigned to the PMU is three-fold: (i) to plan and manage the implementation of the project,&#13;
distributing the various tasks involved in its execution between the Unit itself and the Departments existing&#13;
within the formal structure of DNER, (ii) to prepare the annual work programs to be financed under the&#13;
project, monitor their implementation and report on progress made to the Director-General, and (iii)&#13;
establish and maintain, on behalf of DNER, all relationships with the Bank and IDB as well as with other&#13;
Governmental Departments and States authorities involved in the Project.&#13;
6.     The Project Management Unit has its headquarters in Brasilia and its relation with the DNER's&#13;
organizational structure is illustrated in Chart 1. The PMU comprises the following seven sub-units, all of&#13;
which will be headed by DNER staff (Chart 2):&#13;
* an Administrative Sub-unit&#13;
* a Rehabilitation Sub-unit&#13;
a Decentralization Sub-unit&#13;
* a Concession and Institutional Development Sub-unit&#13;
and three Regional Sub-units for the North-East, South-East, and South with headquarters&#13;
in Salvador, Belo-Horizonte, and Porto-Alegre respectively.&#13;
7.     The Administrative Sub-unit, with the participation of all relevant DNER's operational&#13;
departments, is responsible for the elaboration and implementation of the computerized information systems&#13;
that will enable to control, monitor and report on the physical, financial and administrative progress of all&#13;
works and services executed and financed under the project, all in accordance with DNER's procedures and&#13;
Bank's requirements.  The Rehabilitation Sub-unit, with the participation of the Directors of the&#13;
Departments involved in the project (including regional districts), is responsible for the preparation of the&#13;
detailed implementation schedule, including the necessary annual budget resources allocations, for all&#13;
works to be executed on the highways to remain federal, and for the monitoring of their physical and&#13;
financial execution, including progress reports writing. The Sub-unit is also in charge of updating the&#13;
Operational Manual as may be necessary. The Decentralization Sub-unit, also in consultation with the&#13;
other operational DNER's Departments and the highway authorities of participating States, is responsible&#13;
for the preparation of the detailed implementation schedule, including the necessary budget resources&#13;
allocations, for all the works to be carried out on the highways to be transferred and for the monitoring of&#13;
their physical and financial execution, including the preparation of corresponding progress reports. The&#13;
sub-unit will also contribute to any update to be made of the Operational Manual. The Concession and&#13;
Institutional Development Sub-unit , in consultation with the Concession Department, the Research&#13;
Institute (IPR) is responsible for the preparation of the detailed implementation schedule of the concession&#13;
and institutional development components, including the related annual budgetary resources allocations,&#13;
and for monitoring the physical and financial progress of execution, including compliance with established&#13;
performance indicators and targets. The Regional Sub-units task is to represent and complement the action&#13;
of the central unit in Brasilia, in providing more immediate assistance to subprojects activities performed&#13;
either by DNER's regional districts under the rehabilitation component or by States DERs under the&#13;
decentralization component.&#13;

C. Project Management Technical Assistance&#13;
8.    In order to fill short-term gaps in DNER's current capacity to implement the project, technical&#13;
assistance shall be provided throughout the project implementation period to the PMU and through it to the&#13;
various departments involved in the execution and monitoring of the project. The Terms of Reference for&#13;
this technical assistance describes as follows the scope of the services and the tasks to be performed by the&#13;
Consultant. In the initial stage of project implementation, the Consultant will assist the PMU in Brasilia in:&#13;
(i) the preparation of a detailed Project Implementation Plan, in consultation with the various&#13;
departments concerned;&#13;
(ii)  the identification of tasks to be carried out for work supervision and monitoring;&#13;
(iii)  the preparation of a model of work plan to be used by the States participating to the&#13;
decentralization program;&#13;
(iv)  the development of an appropriate set of procedures for obtaining environmental licenses for the&#13;
works;&#13;
(v)  the development of specific software, manuals and procedures for the planning and programming&#13;
of works, both in physical and financial terms;&#13;
(vi)  the definition of suitable performance indicators and reliable targets monitoring plans and data&#13;
collection methodologies for works, and institutional development, including specific environmental&#13;
and safety indicators;&#13;
(vii)  the development of a computerized project management system, including a review of DNER&#13;
existing administrative procedures and recommendations for their improvement;&#13;
(viii) the design of a system for processing systematic requests of funds;&#13;
(ix)  the preparation of systems and models for the transmission of all technical, legal, and fiscal&#13;
documentation required by the financing agencies or other governmental departments; and&#13;
(x)  the preparation of agreements or protocols to be signed with participating states and the review of&#13;
their work program.&#13;
During project implementation, the services required from the Consultant shall comprise:&#13;
(i) the preparation of all information as required by the loan agreements or by the financing agencies&#13;
for the purpose of their supervision of the project;&#13;
(ii) the periodic review and update of the detailed Project Implementation Plan&#13;
(iii)  the preparation of all documentation related to bidding, proposal evaluation, contract award and&#13;
statement of expenditures in support of request for disbursement, as may be required by the Banks&#13;
or other government agencies; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                                  Annex 6&#13;
(iv) the preparation of periodic progress reports, including disbursement projections and status of&#13;
compliance with the specified targets.&#13;
9.     The Consultant shall also provide assistance to the Administrative Sub-unit in the monitoring of&#13;
payments made and status of disbursement , and the Rehabilitation, Decentralization and Concession Units&#13;
in the preparation of their annual program and budgets and in the monitoring of such programs both in&#13;
physical and financial terms, assessing also whether they achieved the standards of performance and quality&#13;
as well as the targets specified in the loan agreement. Vis A vis the Regional Subunit, the Consultant will&#13;
provide assistance similar to that given to the Central Unit reinforcing the control of that unit on site in&#13;
order to ensure that the rehabilitation and decentralization components are progressing satisfactorily. To&#13;
that effect, it is expected that the Consultant will assign and maintain adequate representation in the three&#13;
Regional Subunits. In the final stage of project implementation, the Consultant is expected to assist the&#13;
Coordinating Unit in the collection of all data enabling to assess the final status of execution of the project&#13;
in financial economic, technical and administrative terms. Furthermore, the Consultant will prepare the&#13;
Project Implementation Completion Report including a plan for the subsequent maintenance of the Federal&#13;
Network on a sustainable basis. The length of the Technical Assistance Contract is estimated at 54 months&#13;
and the total cost at U$13 million representing approximately 1,000 specialist-months.&#13;
D. Institutional Capacity Analysis of the State Road Departments&#13;
10.    The success of the decentralization program implies that the State Roads Departments (DERs), to&#13;
which highways are to be transferred, have the capacity not only to prepare, contract, and monitor the&#13;
execution of the rehabilitation works to be carried out on the roads which will become under their&#13;
responsibility, but also to ensure that in the future adequate maintenance strategies are implemented in a&#13;
coherent and cost-effective manner, both on the state network and the federally-devolved highways.&#13;
11.    During project preparation, a survey was carried out to diagnose the capabilities of the DERs to&#13;
effectively take charge of the rehabilitation activities to be performed under this project and also to fulfill,&#13;
at a later stage, the prime functions of network maintenance management. The results of the survey would&#13;
serve as a foundation to design the objectives and tasks of the technical assistance required to bridge the&#13;
institutional capacity gaps identified.&#13;
12.    The survey showed that most DERs suffer to varying degrees, from common deficiencies, such as&#13;
excess of personnel, little planning capacity, and lack of comprehensive pluriannual investments and&#13;
maintenance programs based on objective and updated network and traffic surveys with priorities clearly&#13;
established and supported by sound economic evaluations. Also, very few DERs have yet sufficient&#13;
expertise in environmental impact assessments and little knowledge on how to develop and monitor a&#13;
coherent concession program, while few have yet developed the system of routine maintenance by contract.&#13;
Although some of the states where the devolution of federal highways is expected to be the most important,&#13;
for example Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina have already set up structures&#13;
and road management systems, these will need to be upgraded in order for them to be able to perform&#13;
efficiently the task of maintaining adequately the road system assets.&#13;
13.    The four areas where upgrading is necessary and for which technical assistance is most needed are&#13;
the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                                 Annex 6&#13;
(i)  Development of annual and multi-year road investment and maintenance programs based on&#13;
updated network and traffic surveys, and supported by HDM/EBM economic evaluations;&#13;
(ii)  Design and implementation of more cost-effective maintenance execution programs, giving higher&#13;
priority to maintenance by contract, while keeping force-account involvement within reasonable&#13;
limits;&#13;
(iii)  Identification, preparation, negotiation and supervision of the state's road concession program; and&#13;
(iv)  Development and implementation of a comprehensive training program on environmental impact&#13;
assessment of roadwork.&#13;
14.    The project would finance the technical assistance needed to strengthen the capacity of the DERs&#13;
for performing these functions. To that effect, the following draft Terms of Reference were prepared to&#13;
apply to the procurement of competent consulting firms.&#13;
E. Technical Assistance to State Road Departments&#13;
15.    The main objectives of the technical assistance are to:&#13;
(i)  carry out comprehensive network and traffic surveys (or update previous surveys) and train DERs&#13;
personnel not only in modem surveying techniques but also in using the latest version of the HDM&#13;
model for data analysis, thus enhancing the capacity of the DERs in establishing more adequate&#13;
planning and implementation structures; assisting ultimately in the preparation of the state's annual&#13;
and pluriannual road investment programs;&#13;
(ii)  assist the DERs in the design and implementation of more cost-effective maintenance policies&#13;
based upon an increased participation of the private sector and preferably promoting performance-&#13;
type contracts, while helping in the restructuring and right-sizing of an in-house force-account unit;&#13;
(iii)  strengthen the capacity of DERs for identifying, preparing, negotiating and supervising the state's&#13;
highway concession program; and&#13;
(iv)  strengthen the capacity of DERs to perform environmental impact assessments of road projects,&#13;
including the development of appropriate environmental norms and the building up of the&#13;
conditions enabling to enforce the environmental regulations.&#13;
7.     The following tasks would be performed by the technical assistance:&#13;
(i)  review existing methods and/or develop more appropriate methodologies for traffic and network&#13;
inventories, including surface defects, roughness, structural capacity assessment, and evolve&#13;
computer processing programs enabling the results of the surveys to be presented in a suitable and&#13;
attractive form (GIs system), while allowing them to be readily input in the subsequent economic&#13;
evaluations;&#13;
(ii)  carry out the above-mentioned traffic and network condition surveys, training the personnel in the&#13;
process;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                                 Annex 6&#13;
(iii) on the basis of the above, assist in the preparation of the state's annual and pluriannual road&#13;
program, considering budget constraint, and using the HDM/EBM model (including, possibly, the&#13;
more recent HDM 4 version);&#13;
(iv) review the DERs policy on maintenance, analyze existing structures including personnel and&#13;
equipment capacity and performance; develop a new strategy for improving and right-sizing the&#13;
organization, seeking to expand the execution of routine maintenance by contract; and develop&#13;
procedures for the design, procurement and supervision of maintenance contracts with the private&#13;
sector, seeking to introduce and promote performance or result-based systems, in lieu of the&#13;
traditional quantity-based contracts;&#13;
(v)  review all existing studies and data, if any, regarding the road concession program of the state to&#13;
determine whether they are sufficient, and/or otherwise assist in the selection and prioritization of&#13;
specific road segments for concessioning, including economic, financial, and legal analysis; and&#13;
help in the preparation of the road concession tender documents, and provide guidance for the&#13;
supervision and monitoring of on-going concession projects; and&#13;
(vi) evaluate the current capacity of each participating DER to conduct environmental impact&#13;
assessments and elaborate on that basis a training program to improve that capacity and to enable&#13;
the DER's staff to effectively implement the environmental norms and guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Economic Analysis&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    In order to prepare the multiyear (1997-2001) road maintenance program and define adequate&#13;
budgetary needs as well as priorities for resource allocations, the Planning Division of DNER carried out&#13;
an economic evaluation of the entire federal paved highway network, using the latest version of the Banks&#13;
Highway Design and Maintenance Standard Model (HDM-III and HDM Manager) associated with the&#13;
Highway Sector Expenditure Budgeting Model (EBM-HS).&#13;
2.     The HDM III is designed to make comparative cost estimates and economic evaluations of different&#13;
construction and maintenance options, including different staging strategies, either for a given road section&#13;
or an entire network. The model simulates total life cycle conditions and costs and provides economic&#13;
decision criteria for multiple road design and maintenance alternatives. The primary cost set for the life-&#13;
cycle analysis includes the costs of road construction and maintenance and vehicle operating costs to which&#13;
travel time costs can be added as a special option. The concept can be simply outlined as follows:&#13;
determining costs, adding the set of costs over time and comparing the total cost streams for various&#13;
maintenance and construction alternatives. The basic data requirements are the road or network description,&#13;
construction options, maintenance standards and unit costs, vehicle characteristics and unit costs, traffic&#13;
volumes and projections, exogenous benefits and costs, analysis period and discount rates. The essential&#13;
references for understanding and running the model are contained in "The Highway Design and&#13;
Maintenance Standards Model. Model description and User's Manual" by Thawat Watanatada et al&#13;
published for the World Bank by the John Hopkins University Press in December 1987.&#13;
3.     The HDM Manager is a user-friendly shell environment developed over the last three years by the&#13;
World Bank for specific customized applications of HDM. For the economic evaluation of the federal&#13;
highway network, the latest version (version 3) dated December 1994 was used in association with the full&#13;
HDM III software package. HDM Manager is designed to evaluate a set of road agency strategies,&#13;
including congestion analysis, applied to paved and unpaved roads. It stores the input data efficiently and&#13;
creates all the input files required by HDM. It then transfers, from within the shell, the data to HDM III&#13;
which in turn computes the road deterioration, the costs streams and the economic indicators used to&#13;
compare the set of strategies analyzed. Finally HDM Manager collects and presents the results in a&#13;
practical way. However, unlike the main HDM program, HDM Manager does not enable to divide links&#13;
into sections and subsections, and execute only one link at a time using five alternative maintenance&#13;
strategies and up to seven vehicle types. For the calculation of vehicle operating costs, it uses the&#13;
fundamental equations derived from the Brazil experiments. Before running the HDM Model, HDM&#13;
Manager requires the user to define: (i) the discount rate, analysis period, initial year and currency, (ii) the&#13;
road characteristics, (iii) the vehicle fleet; and (iv) the maintenance or construction strategies to be&#13;
evaluated with their respective unit costs.&#13;
4.     The EBM-HS Model is an analytical tool for optimizing multiyear programs of expenditures under&#13;
multiple budgetary constraints. Particularly useful when used in conjunction with the HDM program,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -                                   Annex 7&#13;
EBM-HS reads the project data generated by HDM III (as previously stored in an ASCII text file) and&#13;
finds the optimal maintenance policy (i.e., the policy that maximizes the net benefits) under budgetary&#13;
constraints. It is capable of handling up to 100 projects (i.e., maintenance, upgrading, construction,&#13;
widening, etc...) with 16 mutually exclusive altematives. The annual values of economic costs and&#13;
benefits, including the annual amounts of capital and recurrent resources needed, are calculated for each&#13;
project alternative. The EBM-HS program then examines the resources consumed and the Net Present&#13;
Value (NPV) of the net benefits of each project alternative, and selects the group of altematives that&#13;
maximizes the total NPV for all projects within the pre-defined budget constraints.&#13;
B. Methodology of Economic Evaluation&#13;
5.     The economic evaluation follows a step-by-step procedure:&#13;
(i)  survey the road network, according to agreed Terms of Reference in order to collect the minimum&#13;
and yet necessary amount of information on traffic, pavement condition and environmental&#13;
parameters;&#13;
(ii) compile the survey data into a road data-base that enables to sort and statistically analyze them in&#13;
the most efficient manner;&#13;
(iii) identify and estimate the unit costs of the current and most effective maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
(or upgrading) techniques compatible with the current experience and material resources;&#13;
(iv) determine DNER's most probable budget constraint scenarios for the next five years on the basis&#13;
of past experience;&#13;
(v) on the basis of the information obtained from the inventory, design a matrix which would&#13;
desegregate the road network into homogeneous groups of roads or links suitable for evaluation,&#13;
and formulate maintenance policies alternatives for each one of these groups (or cells of the&#13;
matrix); and finally;&#13;
(vi) calibrate the HDM III model in order to adapt, as necessary, the road deterioration submodel and to&#13;
reflect modem vehicle technology in so far as it affects vehicle operating costs;&#13;
(vii) run the HDM Manager and EBM models to arrive at the optimum set of maintenance strategies&#13;
consistent with budget constraints, and the listing of priorities with corresponding expenditures for&#13;
the 1997-2001 period.&#13;
C. Basic Parameters and Assumptions used in the Analysis&#13;
6.     The basic parameters and assumptions used to run the HDM and EBM models are:&#13;
(i)  Network conditions and characteristics, including traffic volumes, composition and growth;&#13;
(ii) Vehicle characteristics and operating unit costs; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                                   Annex 7&#13;
(iii) Typical construction, overlay and maintenance techniques with their respective unit costs. Network&#13;
conditions and characteristics are summarized in Table 6 and Table 7. Values used for the cost&#13;
parameters are given below. In addition, the following assumptions were made: Discount rate =&#13;
12%; Analysis Period = 20 years; Traffic Growth = 3 % per year; Year 1 of implementation =&#13;
1997; Generated Traffic = 0; Nature of benefits = reduced vehicle operating costs, time savings of&#13;
road users, and reduction in maintenance costs.&#13;
(a)    Network Survey&#13;
7.     Prior to starting the network survey, and in order to standardize data collection methodologies,&#13;
Terms of Reference were prepared both for the District engineers and for the consultants contracted to&#13;
assist in the inventory. The procedures used for collecting information were designed to be consistent with&#13;
the minimum requirements of the economic model to be used (HDM Manager), and also to achieve speed at&#13;
reasonable cost. The survey was carried out by region, each of the five regions comprised between 9,000&#13;
and 11,000 k1m, covering altogether approximately 52,000 km. It comprised the following tasks:&#13;
(i)  a definition (identification name, length, age of construction...) of individual homogeneous&#13;
segments forming the federal network, based on archives available within DNER;&#13;
(ii) the quantification of the geometrical, structural and environmental parameters characterizing each&#13;
homogeneous segment, i.e., width of pavement and shoulders, pavement surface type, rainfall,&#13;
altitude and topography; such information being obtained from DNER's files or from the district&#13;
engineers;&#13;
(iii) visual assessment, on a continuous basis, of surface defects enabling the extent (%) of potholes and&#13;
cracking to be determined for each homogeneous link, followed by a rating which reflects the&#13;
overall serviceability index of that link (a rating of 5 meaning excellent condition, a rating of 1&#13;
meaning poor condition); such assessment being made by the district engineers;&#13;
(iv) characterization of the pavement structure for each homogeneous link, including the definition of&#13;
the thickness and geotechnical nature of the materials forming that structure, as well as subgrade&#13;
CBR values; this information being obtained either from existing files or from a few pits dug in the&#13;
pavements;&#13;
(v) continuous roughness measurements using calibrated response-type equipment (Mays meter, Bump&#13;
integrator, or equivalent); the measurements covering the totality of the paved network;&#13;
(vi) deflection, cracking, potholes and rut depth measurements on some 1,500 one-km-long test sections&#13;
selected to represent the whole network, thus enabling each uniform segment to be associated with&#13;
representative values of deflection and rut depth; and&#13;
(vii) and finally three-day traffic counts at specific locations in order to capture traffic characteristics on&#13;
each uniform section of the network; the counts involving the assessment of both the volumes and&#13;
the distribution of vehicles by class; (annual traffic growth projection figures being obtained from&#13;
past records and/or predicted growth of other economic indicators).&#13;
8.     The visual surveys and general traffic information provided by the districts were carried out&#13;
between June and December 1995, while the roughness and deflection measurements as well as additional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-73-                                                Annex 7&#13;
traffic counts were carried out by consultants between January and May 1996. A rate of survey of&#13;
approximately 10,000 km per month was achieved.&#13;
9.      Following the collection of data, all the information was compiled into a computerized data bank&#13;
designed to enable easy processing and consistency across regions. The worksheets uniformly contained&#13;
about 30 columns representing the road and traffic conditions parameters required by HDM Manager, and&#13;
as many rows as individual road segments within the network. By and large, the average length of each&#13;
individual section varied from  10 km to 50 krn. Once the information were entered in the data bank, they&#13;
were analyzed, checked for consistency, sorted out and rearranged in larger homogeneous groups of roads&#13;
having similar surface, structural, traffic and environmental characteristics.&#13;
(b)     Vehicle Characteristics and Operating Costs&#13;
10.     Data for estimating vehicle operating costs were collected at federal level and the values used in the&#13;
analyses are summarized below. Costs are given in economic terms, financial costs being about 1.7 times&#13;
economic costs, overall.&#13;

11.     On the basis of the above vehicle characteristics and after calibration of the HDM  model (paras. 17&#13;

and terrain conditions, the vehicle operating cost per km traveled for each category of vehicle and also for a&#13;

Note: Full width overlays only apply to roads with traffic ADT&gt;5,000&#13;
(d)    Budget Constraints&#13;
13.    Over the last ten years, resource allocations made available to DNER for the rehabilitation of the&#13;
50,000 km paved network varied between US$130 million and US$400 million, averaging about US$300&#13;
million per year. Accordingly, and for a reduced network of about 40,000 km (excluding roads to be&#13;
concessioned), the following scenarios of annual budget constraints for investments in rehabilitation, over&#13;
the next six years, were used in the analysis, namely: US$ 200, 225, 250, 275, and 300 million.&#13;
As from year 7, an unconstrained budget resources was selected in order to determine the actual&#13;
annual allocations needed as a result of implementing the above scenario during the first six years of the&#13;
period of analysis. Moreover, resource allocations for routine maintenance were left unconstrained during&#13;
the twenty- year- period of analysis, representing approximately US$ 2,000/km/year.&#13;
(e)    Design of Analytical Matrices&#13;
14.    Prior to conducting the economic evaluation, two matrices were designed in order to desegregate&#13;
the road network according to surface type (see Table 8). One matrix, the larger one, comprised all&#13;
pavements with asphalt concrete wearing course. The second matrix concemed pavements with surface&#13;
treatments. The results of the surveys indicated that for all practical purposes, there was no need to include&#13;
rigid concrete pavements as they represent a negligible portion of the network (about 150 km i.e., 0.3%)&#13;
and cannot be properly analyzed by the current HDM model.&#13;
15.    Each matrix contained a number of cells designed according to the following parameters:&#13;
(i)  maintenance condition of the network, including 5 rating categories: excellent, good, fair, critical&#13;
and poor as a function of roughness, the thresholds used being IRI &lt; 2.5 for excellent condition,&#13;
2.5 &lt; IRI &lt; 3 for good condition, 3 &lt;IRI&lt; 3.5 for fair condition, 3.5 &lt; IRI &lt;4.5 for critical&#13;
condition, and IRI &gt; 4.5 for poor condition;&#13;
(ii) structural strength, including strong pavements with deflection less than 0.45 mm (or modified&#13;
structural number above 5), and weak pavements having mean deflection higher than 0.45 mm (or&#13;
modified structural number below 5);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                                    Annex 7&#13;
(iii) traffic level, discriminating 7 classes between very low, low, medium-low, medium, medium-high,&#13;
high, and very high, these levels being respectively &lt; 1,200, 1,200-1,800, 1,800-2,300, 2,33-3,100,&#13;
3,100-4,800, 4800-10,000 and &gt; 10,000 vehicles/day ; the matrix for surface-dressed roads&#13;
including only the very low to medium-low traffic classes.&#13;
16.    The desegregation gave rise to the identification of homogeneous groups of roads or links, suitable&#13;
for evaluation. By definition, each group, of a given total or accumulated length, normally falls within one&#13;
cell of the matrices as having similar characteristics, and is to be subjected to a specific set of maintenance&#13;
policy alternatives, as described in para. 21 and 22. Asphalt concrete roads comprised 70 filled cells and&#13;
surfaced- dressed roads had 30 filled cells. Each cell had an identification code which reflected the above-&#13;
described characteristics.&#13;
(f)    Calibration of the HDM Model&#13;
17.    VOC submodel. The vehicle operating cost submodel was calibrated by updating vehicle costs&#13;
and characteristics and by adjusting the maintenance parts equations of the HDM III model to reflect&#13;
modern vehicle technology. The recent HDM-4 international study indicated that the maintenance parts&#13;
equations of HDM-III over-estimates parts consumption for modem vehicles and depicted an inconsistency&#13;
in the parts consumption rate (sensitivity of parts consumption to roughness) for passenger cars that rate&#13;
being significantly higher than for other vehicles, probably due to the types of vehicles used in the HDM-III&#13;
study. Therefore, following the guidelines of the HDM-4 study, and in addition to discarding variation in&#13;
costs for roughness level lower than 3 IRI, the maintenance parts consumption for 'hew technology"&#13;
vehicles was taken as 75 per cent of the "old technology" vehicles and the parts consumption rate for&#13;
passenger cars was adjusted to be the same as for trucks. Thus, in the table of optional parameters for the&#13;
vehicle fleet data contained in HDM Manager, the default values of 32.49, 1.49, 8.61, and 13.94 used for&#13;
the constant coefficient CPO in the exponential relationship between spare parts consumption and roughness&#13;
(which applied respectively to light vehicles, light trucks, heavy trucks and articulated trucks) were&#13;
replaced by 24.37, 1.128, 6.46, and 10.46. Similarly, for cars and utilities the roughness coefficient CPq in&#13;
the exponential relationship between spare part consumption and roughness was reduced from 13.7 to a&#13;
value of 9. The net impact of these changes is a 59% reduction in roughness effect for light vehicles and&#13;
about 42-43% for trucks. Other calibration adjustments made referred essentially to the energy-efficiency&#13;
factor and the hourly utilization ratios. The energy-efficiency factor which affects directly the prediction of&#13;
fuel consumption was adjusted by replacing the default value of 1 (which applied to vehicles employed&#13;
during the Brazil studies) by 0.8 in order to incorporate modern and more fuel-efficient vehicles makes and&#13;
models; the hourly utilization ratios which affect the prediction of depreciation and interest were adjusted&#13;
by replacing the default values of 0.60, 0.80, 0.75, 0.85 respectively used for cars, utilities, buses, and&#13;
trucks, by 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50. Finally, vehicle and maintenance labor costs were updated along&#13;
with service life and hours driven per year (see Table 1). These adjustments generally resulted in VOC&#13;
values and benefits of a lesser magnitude than calculated with the original model (about 25% less).&#13;
18.    Road deterioration submodel. The road deterioration submodel was calibrated by introducing&#13;
equivalent standard axle factors for heavy vehicles that duly take into account the overloading observed or&#13;
expected to occur on the network. Also, for the assessment of pavement residual strength and the&#13;
prediction of roughness and other surface defects evolution, deflection values effectively measured on the&#13;
network were given precedence over structural numbers estimated from 'theoretical" material strength&#13;
coefficients. Considering the low deflection values measured (generally between 0.3 and 0.6 mm), this&#13;
approach resulted in modified structural numbers greater than what would have been otherwise calculated,&#13;
and consequently to somewhat slower deterioration pattems. Finally, the applicability of the roughness&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-77-                                     Annex 7&#13;
progression model was evaluated by comparing the values of roughness observed on the 1,500 test sections&#13;
to the values calculated by HDM-3. Although, and as would be expected, some dispersion occurred due to&#13;
the large number of sample included in the statistical analysis, it was found that the HDM-3 model gives a&#13;
satisfactory prediction of roughness, with a I to I ratio between observed and predicted values.&#13;
19.    Maintenance costs submodel. Investments and maintenance unit costs were also updated, taking&#13;
into account the most recent figures obtained from bidding and incorporating all additional costs related to&#13;
shoulders repairs and upgrading, drainage rehabilitation, and pavement markings (estimated to be about 20&#13;
to 30% of total costs). These unit costs, however, do not include additional costs resulting from other&#13;
operational improvements such as climbing lanes, exceptional safety devices, and special environmrental&#13;
improvements as such expenditures are separately provided for in the project cost estimate.&#13;
D. Evaluation of Multiyear Program&#13;
20.    The economic evaluation covered altogether 38,566 km of roads, of which 29,335 km are to&#13;
remain under DNER jurisdiction and 9,231 km are to be devolved to the states. A total of 13,190 km of&#13;
roads, consisting of the highways already under concession (about 850 km), others to be concessioned but&#13;
currently under rehabilitation or upgrading contracts including the Sao Paulo-Belo Horizonte and Curitiba-&#13;
Florianopolis highways (about 1,500 km), the 4,000 km of roads recently delegated to the states of Parana&#13;
and Rio Grande do Sul for inclusion in their concession program, the up-coming DNER own concession&#13;
program (about 4,200 km) as well as about 2,600 km of other roads currently under rehabilitation&#13;
contracts, were excluded from the analysis. Regarding the DNER own concession program, a special&#13;
contingency allocation of about US$100 million over 5 years representing 3 cm asphalt concrete overlay&#13;
over the critical portion of that network, would be provided to keep them serviceable until concession is&#13;
awarded.&#13;
21     Phasing of the economic evaluation. The economic evaluation was carried out in 2 separate&#13;
phases. In the first phase, the whole 38,566 km long network was analyzed using various budget constraint&#13;
scenarios ranging from US$200 to 300 million per year, in order to determine the strategies corresponding&#13;
to the resource level alternative that would be compatible with DNER annual financial constraints over the&#13;
next 4 to 5 years. In a second phase, and having determined the optimal budget level alternative, the&#13;
objective was to incorporate in the analysis the results of the discussions held with the various states&#13;
governments on the scope and content of the decentralization program. Negotiations had indeed indicated&#13;
that devolution of highways to the states would be feasible and acceptable only if the total length of&#13;
network to be rehabilitated prior to transfer, was in the order of 4,000 km. Consequently, the second&#13;
exercise aimed at determining - within the limit of the overall budget available - the budget sharing ratio&#13;
(between the network to remain federal and the network to be transferred) that would enable to rehabilitate&#13;
on the network to be devolved, about 4,000 km of roads in critical or poor condition. To that effect, several&#13;
pairs of budget constraint ratios were tested until a mutually satisfactory solution was obtained.&#13;
22.    Steps in the analyses. In both phases of the evaluation, the economic analysis comprised five&#13;
successive steps: (i) the formulation of maintenance policy alternatives for each cell of the matrices (ii) the&#13;
HDM Manager runs at the link group (or cell) level, enabling to compare the returns to be expected from&#13;
each maintenance strategy altemative, (iii) the EBM runs which optimize, at network level, the set of&#13;
strategies analyzed by HDM Manager, taking into account the various budget constraints scenarios, (iv) the&#13;
selection of the set of strategies and priorities which are consistent with the predicted budget constraint&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                                     Annex 7&#13;
level, and (v) a sensitivity analysis for the selected strategy, to assess the impact of cost increases or benefit&#13;
decreases upon the economic returns.&#13;
23.    Formulation of Maintenance Alternatives.  Strategies can be either scheduled in time or&#13;
responsive to a certain threshold of surface condition. For paved roads in good condition which do not need&#13;
periodic maintenance actions in the near future, the first intervention was scheduled to take place in years 5&#13;
(i.e., in 2001), 7, 9, and 11, with future overlay action (5 cm asphalt concrete overlay), triggered at a&#13;
roughness level of 4 IRI. For paved roads in fair to poor condition, periodic maintenance actions can be&#13;
expected to be needed immediately or in the near future. The strategies were therefore scheduled to occur&#13;
immediately (year 1 of the project, i.e., in 1997), and also allowed to be postponed to the third, fifth, or&#13;
seventh year of the project in order to test the effect of postponement on the economic returns. Future&#13;
overlay interventions (5 cm A.C ) were also triggered to occur at a roughness level of 4 IRI.&#13;
24.    In the analysis, the base strategy (alternative 1) included routine maintenance with 100% patching&#13;
of potholes and reconstruction when roughness reaches a very high level, i.e., 11 IRI. The other four&#13;
maintenance options to which each cell or group of homogeneous roads were subjected were generally the&#13;
following, depending on traffic level and the condition of the pavement:&#13;
(i)    for asphalt concrete pavements in good condition, routine maintenance was applied during the first&#13;
four years, followed by a 5 cm thick asphalt concrete overlay scheduled to be placed in year 5, or&#13;
7, or 9, or 11. Future policies included another 5 cm of A.C carpet whenever roughness reaches 4&#13;
IRI. For surface-dressed pavements, and following the first four years of routine maintenance,&#13;
slurry seals or surface treatments were used for low traffic levels, with an option of a 5 cm A.C&#13;
overlay for medium -low traffic and weak pavements; these operations being scheduled to occur in&#13;
year 5, or 7, or 9, or I1, with future actions identical to that selected for asphalt concrete&#13;
pavements;&#13;
(ii)   for asphalt concrete pavements in fair or critical condition, thin to medium asphalt concrete&#13;
overlays, ranging in thickness from 3 cm to 8 cm were scheduled to take place in years 1, 3, 5, and&#13;
7; for surface-dressed pavements also in fair or critical condition, surface treatments for low&#13;
traffic levels or 5 cm thick asphalt concrete overlays for low to medium-low traffic levels were&#13;
scheduled in years 1, 3, 5, and 7. Future maintenance policy again included the placing of 5 cm&#13;
A.C carpet whenever roughness reaches 4 IRI;&#13;
(iii)   for asphalt concrete pavements in poor condition, thick asphalt concrete overlays ranging from 5&#13;
cm to 12 cm in thickness were scheduled to occur in years 1, 3, 5 and 7; overlays were generally&#13;
placed after the recycling of the upper 5 cm of the existing pavement. For surface dressed&#13;
pavements, only reconstruction solutions using double-surface dressings for very low traffic or 5 to&#13;
8 cm thick asphalt concrete wearing course for low and medium traffic respectively, were analyzed&#13;
and scheduled to occur in years 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the analysis period. Likewise, future actions&#13;
included a 5 cm thick overlay to be placed when roughness reaches 4 IRI.&#13;

order of US$630 million during a five-year period (compared to a current US$320 million&#13;
under a no-budget constraint scenario).&#13;
26.    The  results  of the  economic  evaluations  are&#13;
summarized in Figures 1 to 3, which show for each of the                        (Ion   &gt;5)&#13;

(ii) the rehabilitation activities implied by this scenario&#13;
(about 14,150 km of civil works over the next 4 to 5       Fig 7. Evolution of Total Transport&#13;

Year&#13;
(iv) selecting  more expensive strategies or scenarios&#13;
would result in a very marginal improvement both in the level of service provided (average&#13;
roughness, percentage of network in poor condition) and in the additional benefits or Net Present&#13;
Value accrued to society (less than 2%).&#13;
28.    The project benefit and cost flows given in  Table 9 of this Annex shows that implementing&#13;
scenario 4 would yield a Net Present Value of about US$ 3.4 billion over a period of about ten years,&#13;
considering only the investments made during the project implementation period (i.e., US$900 million). If&#13;

the strategy recommended by this scenario was applied during the full twenty years period of analysis, with&#13;
annual investments of about US$180 million, as from year 2002, then the Net Present Value of that&#13;
program would be in the order of US$9.4 billion, with a rate of return of 104%.&#13;
29.    The results of the HDM economic evaluation were finally translated into a catalog of technical&#13;
solutions to be applied to each cell of the matrices, as a function of pavement condition and traffic, (Annex&#13;
2) and also into the project Cost and Financing Table 1 (Annex 8). They both correspond to a budget&#13;
constraint of US$225 million per year for rehabilitation works over 14,150 km of roads.&#13;
30.    Second-Phase Study.  The first phase of the economic evaluation indicated that the most&#13;
appropriate budget constraint level to be considered corresponded to annual resources of US$225 million&#13;
during the next 4 to 5 years. Applied to the whole network, and irrespective of the results of negotiations&#13;
with the states, such resources would enable to rehabilitate about 3,000 km of the network to be transferred&#13;
to the states, without attending - because of financial constraints - sections of roads which already show&#13;
obvious signs of fatigue and distress. Discussions held on that basis with the state govermnents confirmed&#13;
the concern the states have in receiving segments of highways in critical condition without proper&#13;
rehabilitation, and it became obvious that the decentralization process would only be successful if the&#13;
rehabilitation program for the state-transferred network comprised about 4,000 km of roads. This caused&#13;
DNER to carry out a follow-up study aimed at determining the budget sharing ratio and corresponding&#13;
strategies (within the overall constraint of US$225 million per year) that would be mutually acceptable.&#13;
31.    The second-phase study consisted in applying separately to the two networks (remaining federal&#13;
and to be transferred) - each one being properly characterized by its own matrix of traffic and pavement&#13;
condition - various levels of budget constraints and determining - within the global US$225 million limit&#13;
annually - the most adequate distribution of resources that would satisfy state's requirements, while&#13;
enabling DNER to improve the condition of its own network. To that effect, about 10 pairs of budget&#13;
sharing ratios were analyzed and submitted to new HDM/EBM evaluations ( ratios ranging from 195/30 to&#13;
155/70 million of dollars, for DNER and State-transferred networks respectively).&#13;
32.    The results of these evaluations are illustrated in Figures 8 to 15. For each network and for the&#13;
various budget constraint scenarios, are indicated the evolution of NPV (both for a 20-year program and&#13;
for the project alone), the total length of roads that can be rehabilitated during the project, the amount of&#13;
annual resources needed in the future, and the resulting roughness condition of the networks, An&#13;
examination of these trends led to the conclusion that the most satisfactory solution was to implement the&#13;
strategies corresponding to a budget sharing ratio of US$ 175/50 million per year. As can be seen in&#13;
Figures 11 and 15 such strategies will allow an overall reduction in the proportion of roads in critical or&#13;
poor condition (IRI&gt;4) from a current figure of 18% to less than 5% in year 2002. The strategies involve&#13;
altogether the rehabilitation of some 14,200 km of roads, i.e., about 37% of the whole network (3,800 km&#13;
pertaining to the network to be transferred). For the federal system the reduction of the proportion of roads&#13;
in critical to poor condition would be from 15% to 5% and for the network to be devolved from 23% to&#13;
about 8%.&#13;
33.    Finally, the design solutions for various traffic classes and road conditions, along with the optimal&#13;
year of intervention and average unit costs, were represented in the form of Catalogs of structures which&#13;
are strictly applicable to the budget constraint scenario taken into account (US$175 million for the federal&#13;
network, and US$50 million for the state-transferred network). The technical solutions proposed should&#13;
normally provide a satisfactory level of service over a period of 10 to 15 years, whereupon a new overlay&#13;
will be required. The catalogs are shown in Annex 2 'Maintenance Strategy"&#13;

F. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis&#13;
34.    Effect of higher costs: A 20%  increase in rehabilitation costs or a 20%  decrease in vehicle&#13;
operation benefits (resulting from either lower traffic volumes or higher VOC) would only marginally affect&#13;
the Internal Economic Rate of Return and the Net Present Value: IERR would still be in the order of 88%&#13;
and NPV would decline by 26%. The NPV would only reach zero if the capital costs would be multiplied&#13;
by a factor of about 4, or traffic would be divided by a factor of similar magnitude, which is very unlikely.&#13;
35.    Effect of delays in execution. In the event that the project would be implemented over a six-year&#13;
period instead of four to five years, the Net Present Value would decline from US$3.4 billion to 3.2 billion&#13;
(i.e., a 4% reduction), the annual resources needed in the future would rise from US$176 million to 206&#13;
million (i.e., a 17% increase), and the average roughness at the end of the implementation period would&#13;
increase by 25%, from 3.2 to about 4 (i.e., a 3% increase in VOC/veh-km from US$0.41 to 0.424).&#13;
36.    Effect of overloading. The effect of overloading was investigated using also the HDM model. For&#13;
the economic evaluation, conservative equivalent standard axle (ESA) loads were selected for the heavy and&#13;
articulated trucks to reflect the likelihood of overloading on the network. Values of 6.7 and 12 standard 18&#13;
kips axle load factors were adopted respectively. In parallel, another analysis was carried out to determine&#13;
the impact of overloading by assuming another scenario in which no overloading occurs, meaning that full&#13;
compliance with the Brazilian law on vehicle weights and axle loads was met. Accordingly, ESA factors of&#13;
1.8 and 3.4 were adopted for the heavy and articulated trucks, respectively. In addition, the effect of&#13;
overloading was analyzed under a no-budget constraint and a US$225 million per year budget constraint&#13;
scenarios.&#13;

as follows:                                                            Budget Constraint&#13;

38.    The impact on the national economy is very                            Overloading Scenano&#13;
different; the benefits accrued to society are much larger&#13;
under the overloading scenario. Over a 20-year period program  of  sustained investment, Net Present&#13;
Values are increased by 20% to 25% whether there is a budget constraint or not. Also, whatever the&#13;
budget-constraint scenario, Benefit/Cost ratios are higher when overloading occurs; with and without&#13;
overloading B/C ratios are 1.7 compared to 1.5 under budget-constraint, and 1.94 compared to 1.6 under&#13;
no-budget constraint. Overloading, to the extent taken into account in the analysis, results in vehicle&#13;
operating costs 25% to 53% lower than in the case of no-overloading. These conclusions are consistent&#13;
with previous studies that show that total transport costs decrease dramatically when legal maximum single&#13;
axle loads are raised from 8 - 10 tons up to 13 - 15 tons.&#13;

G. Fiscal Impact Analysis&#13;
39.    The Federal Government will benefit from the reduced recurrent costs of maintaining the highways&#13;
rehabilitated under the project and from the avoided much higher costs of future reconstruction, as well as&#13;
from the transfer of highways responsibilities to state governments and/or to private concessionaires who&#13;
would recover costs through tolls. Under the conservative assumption that, without the project, DNER&#13;
would not carry out substantial rehabilitation work in the next five years, the fiscal impact of the project is&#13;
not significant over 1997-2001, but it becomes very positive thereafter, when heavy reconstruction would&#13;
be needed if the project was not implemented. The state governments will receive additional periodic and&#13;
routine  maintenance  expenditure  responsibilities  through  the  decentralization  component.   These&#13;
responsibilities, however, will be minimized by the rehabilitation and resurfacing works to be carried out&#13;
under the project. They will be reduced through the concession program, which will transfer rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance expenditures, and capacity investments on federal and state highways, to road users.&#13;
Overall, the impact of the project on the states' finances is not significant (Table 9.b hereinafter).&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Supervision and Monitoring Plan&#13;
1.    The National Road Department (DNER) would, as part of the action plan to strengthen project&#13;
management and program monitoring, establish an appropriate computerized system to monitor the&#13;
implementation of the project, including producing adequate informnation to report to DNER management,&#13;
the Government, and to the Bank, in accordance with the specifications included in the OM. DNER would&#13;
forward quarterly progress reports to the Bank, not later than one month after the end of the quarter.&#13;
2.    The Bank would, as part of its project supervision responsibilities, review and comment on the&#13;
following documents: (a) DNER annual rehabilitation programs and budgets; (b) state rehabilitation&#13;
subproject applications and related documentation (delegation agreements, subproject implementation&#13;
plans); (c) specific investment applications, including the results of the engineering, economic and&#13;
environmental analyses; (d) annual procurement and execution programs; (e) procurement documentation&#13;
for all ICB and the first two NCB contracts for civil works procuured by DNER and by each participating&#13;
DER; (f) terms of reference, invitation letters, short-lists and draft contract for consultant services; and (g)&#13;
the quarterly progress reports. The Bank would approve all subprojects for financing under the loan on the&#13;
basis of subproject applications, and all investments on the basis of specific investment applications,&#13;
prepared in the agreed format included in the OM.&#13;
3.    The Bank would monitor project implementation against the PIP, including the sets of actions and&#13;
timetable, procurement, physical and financial execution targets, and development impact (Annex 8,&#13;
Table 1). A mid-term, detailed review of the implementation of the project would be carried out by the end&#13;
of 1999 or when 50% of the loan amount is disbursed, whichever is earlier. The review would cover all the&#13;
agreed actions, targets dates, and execution targets included in the PIP and the status of compliance with all&#13;
covenants of the Loan Agreement. Particular importance will be given to: (a) the federal governments'&#13;
commitment to provide adequate funds for maintenance and rehabilitation, including counterpart funds for&#13;
the project; and (b) DNER's performance under the agreed institutional development component. The Bank&#13;
will have the right to exercise appropriate remedies, including suspension of disbursements and termination&#13;
of the loan, if the state government and/or DNER have defaulted under the funding condition and/or&#13;
DNER's performance is not satisfactory.&#13;
4.     The Bank will supervise and monitor the implementation of the project in accordance with the Plan&#13;
presented on the next page. The estimates of Bank supervision inputs into key activities, which are shown&#13;
in the table of this annex.&#13;

            Brazil - Federal Highway Rehabilitation and
            Decentralization Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Federal Highway Rehabilitation and
            Decentralization Project's main objective is to improve
            and maintain the serviceability of the main highway network
            on a sustainable basis, with a view to reducing road
            transport costs. Specific objectives are to: 1) rehabilitate
            federal highways; 2) decentralize highway responsibilities
            to state governments; 3) increase the participation of the
            private sector in the management and financing of highways
            through concessions and maintenance management contracts;
            and 4) strengthen the capabilities of the National Roads
            Department and the State Road Departments to prepare,
            contract and monitor efficient network rehabilitation and
            maintenance programs and highway concession projects. The
            project will consist of three main components: (a) highway
            decentralization, including: (i) technical assistance and
            training services; and (ii) state rehabilitation
            subprojects; (b) highway concession development, including:
            (i) technical assistance and training services; and (ii)
            concession studies; and (c) federal highway comprising: (i)
            technical assistance and training services; and (ii) federal
            rehabilitation subprojects.
