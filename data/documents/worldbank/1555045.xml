METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING AGRICULTURAL PRICE INTERVENTION EFFECTS&#13;
This paper describes the use of micro-economic, informal methodologies&#13;
in six country case studies (Argentina, Egypt, Kenya, Pakistan, Thailand and&#13;
Yugoslavia) and in subsequent additional analysis. The research has confirmed&#13;
that there is extensive intervention with market forces by governments in&#13;
LDCs, which has turned the domestic terms of trade against agriculture and has&#13;
significant efficiency and income distribution effects. The methodologies --&#13;
which include the use of nominal and effective protection coefficients, domestic&#13;
resource cost, and net economic benefit coefficients, producer and consumer&#13;
subsidy equivalents and producer and consumer surpluses -- are evaluated in&#13;
terms of their capacity: (a) to provide Bank staff with operationally useful&#13;
instruments of analysis; (b) to offer appropriate advice to client country&#13;
governments and their planning institutions concerned with pricing policies; and&#13;
(c) to help bridge the methodological gap between project cost benefit analysis&#13;
on the one hand and sector and country economic work on the other hand. While&#13;
the micro-economic methodologies have their limitations, they do provide&#13;
useful tools of analysis, especially for countries which have sets of national&#13;
parameters (accounting prices and conversion factors), which can also be used in&#13;
project cost benefit analysis. Application of the methodologies clearly involves&#13;
additional country economic and sector work, but the extent of the discrimination&#13;
against agriculture in general and food production in particular justifies&#13;
some substitution or the use of additional resources on this type of policy&#13;
analysis on a systematic basis. The paper recommends a three stage work program,&#13;
and some short-cuts are proposed. This paper should be read in conjunction with&#13;
"Agricultural Prices, Taxes and Subsidies, a Review of Experience", a forthcoming&#13;
Staff Working Paper by Gilbert Brown and Graham Donaldson; and four case studies&#13;
for: Argentina (Reca), Egypt (Cuddihy), Pakistan (Brown and Gotsch) and Thailand&#13;
(Bertrand).&#13;

METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING AGRICULTURAL PRICE&#13;
INTERVENTION EFFECTS&#13;
PROLOGUE&#13;
i.        In most less developed countries (LDCs), the domestic terms of&#13;
trade for agriculture vis-a-vis the other sectors of the economy, particularly&#13;
the manufacturing sector, are unfavorable. The agricultural terms of trade&#13;
have been lowered in LDCs as a result of a variety of Government interventions.&#13;
Some of these interventions are the instruments for applying an implicit&#13;
theory of economic development which had its heyday 20-30 years ago, but&#13;
which is less fashionable at the present time. Other interventions stem from&#13;
a variety of ad hoc beliefs, concerns and considerations, such as the ease of&#13;
raising revenue (from export taxes on agricultural products and the appropria-&#13;
tion of the profits of monopsonistic agricultural marketing boards); the need&#13;
to placate pressure groups, particularly urban ones where, it is believed,&#13;
that political power primarily resides (keep the cost of urban wage goods,&#13;
i.e. food and some clothes, low); the importance of stabilizing agricultural,&#13;
particularly food, prices; the belief that infant manufacturing industries&#13;
need to be heavily protected, and the propensity of politicians to look only&#13;
at short-run effects and to ignore longer-term considerations.&#13;
ii.       The implicit theory of economic development, which has been the&#13;
inspiration of so much intervention, put simply, runs like this: productivity&#13;
and productivity growth rates are (much) higher in non-agricultural, parti-&#13;
cularly manufacturing, sectors than in the agricultural sector, ergo priority&#13;
in development must be given to manufacturing, and to do this resources--the&#13;
agricultural surplus and foreign exchange--must be tapped and transferred to&#13;
finance manufacturing investment. Underlying this theory are two suppositions&#13;
1/ of considerable importance: first, is the assumption that prices do not&#13;
matter because farmers are not price responsive and, therefore, they can be&#13;
taxed without a major effect on overall output and without disturbing production&#13;
patterns.  Put in economic jargon, this means that supply is inelastic, both&#13;
in the short-run and in the long-run. Second, is the heroic belief that&#13;
bureaucrats are capable of solving what are in essence a myriad of simultaneous&#13;
equations, which are normally solved, however one may dislike the solutions,&#13;
in the market place. It is a heroic belief even in the more developed countries;&#13;
how much more heroic is it in LDCs with their poor information services and&#13;
very scarce managerial resources.&#13;
iii.      This development theory, together with the other beliefs, concerns&#13;
and considerations mentioned above, have spawned a veritable host of interven-&#13;
tions: administrative prices, physical controls, taxes and subsidies, which&#13;
have tended to proliferate over the years in response to the relative ineffec-&#13;
tiveness of partial intervention. There are signs, however, of a rethinking&#13;
of the theories, beliefs and concerns and a greater propensity, if not to&#13;
allow prices to allocate scarce resources, at least to guide the decisions of&#13;
bureaucrats. There is also a growing realization that the theories of market&#13;
intervention have either not achieved what it was believed they would or,&#13;
perhaps, that in a number of countries the planners may have killed, or made&#13;
ill, the goose which lays the golden egg.&#13;
1/   There are others, which are not discussed here, and we do not discuss&#13;
the soundness of the theory as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-ii-&#13;
iv.       It is curious that so little attention has been paid to or research&#13;
undertaken into the effects of administered agricultural prices, taxes and&#13;
subsidies on the patterns of production, consumption, income distribution,&#13;
agricultural research and development generally. I/ Little or no attempts&#13;
have been made by developing countries to monitor and evaluate the effects of&#13;
government interventions. The Bank's attitude towards administered agricultural&#13;
prices, taxes and subsidies had not been spelled out in any kind of policy&#13;
paper and no guidelines had been provided to country economists, agricultural/&#13;
rural sector economists or project analysts as to how they might analyze the&#13;
situations in their countries. It was for these reasons that a research&#13;
project was started in the second half of 1976. It was based upon 8 country&#13;
case studies. The basis for selection was partly geographic spread, partly&#13;
interesting examples of different kinds of interventions, partly the avail-&#13;
ability of data--a more or less serious constraint in all countries, and&#13;
partly the willingness of governments to permit the studies. It is not&#13;
claimed that the resulting list--Argentina, Egypt, Kenya, Mexico, Pakistan,&#13;
Portugal, Thailand and Yugoslavia--is a fully representative sample of LDCs:&#13;
they are simply examples of interesting cases of countries with widely differ-&#13;
ing political philosophies, policies, resources and technologies. Mexico and&#13;
Portugal were chosen because agricultural sector models exist 2/, which could&#13;
be used to contrast with the informal, more partial equilibrium methods being&#13;
used for the other countries. No West African countries were included because&#13;
of the four case studies made earlier by Balassa and Associates. 3/&#13;
5.        The central issues which the research project was designed to&#13;
address were the effects of interventions on a) the efficient allocation of&#13;
scarce resources, and b) the distribution of income--between individuals,&#13;
between rural and urban areas and between agricultural and non-agricultural&#13;
sectors. In order to analyze the central issues of efficient resource alloca-&#13;
tion and equitable distribution effects, it is necessary to ask:&#13;
-    What are prevalent kinds and what is the extent of government&#13;
intervention?&#13;
-    What are the theories and objective functions (goals) which&#13;
underlie the interventions?&#13;
-    To what extent are actual interventions in harmony with&#13;
stated objectives? And to what extent are interventions&#13;
complementary (reinforcing) or offsetting (conflicting)?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-iii-&#13;
What are the norms by which to judge whether interventions&#13;
are beneficial or harmful to societies--in the short-run&#13;
and in the long-run?&#13;
In the short-run and in the long-run, how do interventions&#13;
affect:&#13;
-    farmer's incentives and supply responses--for particular&#13;
crops/produce within agriculture via the own-elasticity&#13;
and the cross-elasticities of supply--in general and&#13;
relative to other sectors?&#13;
-    resource allocation&#13;
-    employment in agriculture&#13;
-    income distribution&#13;
-    savings, particularly public savings&#13;
-    trade.&#13;
-    How do we measure the effects of various kinds of intervention?&#13;
-    Do governments have the data and the economic expertise available&#13;
to trace the effects of intervention?&#13;
-    In general, do interventions discriminate against agriculture and&#13;
the rural areas?&#13;
-    Is there a real conflict between cheap food for the poor and fair&#13;
prices for the farmers?&#13;
vi.       Clearly, to give answers to all the above questions would be a&#13;
formidable task, and largely because of data problems the case studies concen-&#13;
trated on the efficiency issues.&#13;
vii.      In respect of the informal, more partial equilibrium methodologies,&#13;
after discussion and review it was decided to:&#13;
(a) Undertake 6 country case studies (plus the Mexico and Portugal&#13;
formal agricultural sector models) from which it was hoped that,&#13;
as a minimum expectation, it would be possible to obtain:&#13;
(i)  A description of and recent trends in the system of&#13;
administered agricultural prices, taxes and subsidies&#13;
and other policy tools. The information would be obtained&#13;
from Bank economic, agricultural sector and special study&#13;
reports, supplemented by official government publications&#13;
and field investigations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-iv-&#13;
(ii)  An analysis of the importance of the various policy tools&#13;
with respect to the government budget and public savings,&#13;
agricultural output and consumption. The ratios of:&#13;
taxes on agriculture to total government revenue;&#13;
subsidies to total government recurrent expenditure and&#13;
public savings; value of net taxes/subsidies to the value&#13;
of output; and the value of net subsidies/taxes to consumers&#13;
to the value of consumption would be calculated.&#13;
(iii)  Preliminary analysis of the adequacy of economic incentives&#13;
in relation to the country's comparative economic advantage.&#13;
A limited number of key food and non-food commodities would&#13;
be chosen and initially no attempt would be made to differen-&#13;
tiate between agro-ecological zones. The methodologies used&#13;
would be those used by Balassa and Associates in their West&#13;
African study estimating nominal protection coefficients&#13;
(NPCs), effective protection coefficients (EPCs), effective&#13;
subsidy coefficients (ESCs) and the domestic resource costs&#13;
(DRCs)--and estimating net economic benefits (NEBs), measured&#13;
in economic (efficiency) prices, using a simplified (time-&#13;
collapsed) version of the Little-Mirrlees (L-M) 1/ Squire-&#13;
van der Tak (S-T) 2/ methodology. Data would be drawn&#13;
from Bank Project Appraisal Reports, official government&#13;
publications, farm management studies and field work.&#13;
(iv)  Some broad analysis of the incidence of existing systems&#13;
of administered prices, taxes and subsidies on the&#13;
distribution of incomes as between agriculture and non-&#13;
agriculture and between rich and poor.&#13;
(b) Carry out a literature search of farmers' responses as reflected&#13;
by demand and supply elasticities for selected agricultural&#13;
commodities. 3/&#13;
(c) Undertake a functional review of the treatment of administered&#13;
prices, taxes and subsidies with respect to agriculture in Bank&#13;
economic and sector reports. 4/&#13;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
Introduction&#13;
i.        Research into the extent and effects of government market interven-&#13;
tions within the agricultural sector of developing countries has revealed that&#13;
the interventions are widespread and have important effects upon the efficiency&#13;
of agricultural production, trade, investment and employment, upon cropping&#13;
patterns and resource use and upon the distribution of incomes, both within&#13;
the agricultural sector and between the agricultural sector and other sectors.&#13;
ii.       The research involved inter alia, the application of formal and&#13;
informal methodologies, a literature search into the results of econometric&#13;
studies of supply responses and an analysis of the treatment of agricultural&#13;
market intervention in Bank economic and agricultural sector reports. This&#13;
paper reviews and evaluates the use of a number of informal partial equili-&#13;
brium methodologies in six country case studies (Argentina, Egypt, Kenya,&#13;
Pakistan, Thailand and Yugoslavia) and in subsequent desk studies. Because of&#13;
data problems the studies concentrated on the efficiency rather than on the&#13;
distributional aspects of intevention policies.&#13;
Reference Points&#13;
iii.      In order to measure and then evaluate the effects of government&#13;
intervention which affect incentives, efficiency and income distribution&#13;
through the price mechanism, it is necessary to have a set of reference&#13;
points. Such points can be regarded in either positive or normative ways.&#13;
Border priced values for traded goods are selected, not as perfect, but as the&#13;
only realistic set of reference points available. It is recognized that there&#13;
may be special situations, for individual countries at particular times, when&#13;
one would not want to use border prices, but in general, border priced values&#13;
are the most appropriate opportunity costs for most countries, provided they&#13;
are likely to be enduring as far as can be foreseen. At the very least, the&#13;
use of border price reference points provides an estimation of the net welfare&#13;
losses and transfers resulting from departures from free trade, which may or may&#13;
not be offset by contra advantages. Whether it is considered that they do or do&#13;
not, involves both positive and normative judgments and eventually political&#13;
decisions.&#13;
iv.       Very few countries monitor and evaluate the effects of their market&#13;
interventions on a regular basis. Some "systems" have evolved consciously in&#13;
response to industry-led theories of development, involving taxation of the&#13;
agricultural surplus to finance (heavily) protected manufacturing development.&#13;
Others have grown up in response to ad hoc reactions to specific economic&#13;
events or to placate pressuregroups, and different parts of the system are&#13;
often inconsistent with other parts or with other development objectives.&#13;
Interventions which have caused considerable distortions are difficult to&#13;
remove or modify.&#13;
Valuation of the Traded Goods&#13;
v.        There are problems of identifying appropriate accounting (shadow)&#13;
prices for traded goods, i.e. expressed in border prices or border prices&#13;
equivalent values, but, while care must be exercised to ensure one is compar-&#13;
ing like to like, agricultural products are much more homogeneous than&#13;
manufactured products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vi.        Almost all tradables, which are in fact not traded, and non-tradables&#13;
have some traded elements in them, if only the consumption of traded goods by&#13;
people. Decomposition of such goods will result in traded components and the&#13;
primary non-traded factors of production--labor, land and capital.&#13;
Accounting Price of Labor&#13;
vii.      The accounting price of labor is determined by:     (a) its opportunity&#13;
cost, i.e. the border price value of its weighted average marginal product in&#13;
alternative uses; (b) the cost to society of the increased consumption resulting&#13;
from the additional labor, measured in terms of the foreign exchange foregone; (c)&#13;
the social value of the increased consumption, modified as may be considered to be&#13;
necessary by income distribution and public income weights; (d) the value of leis-&#13;
ure foregone which may be expressed in the form of a reservation wage; and (e) the&#13;
social costs of migration if any.&#13;
Accounting Price of Land&#13;
viii.     The accounting price of land is determined not only by its opportunity&#13;
cost as a factor of production but also by the fact that it is an asset held as&#13;
a hedge against inflation, for speculative purposes and, most important of all,&#13;
as a depository of value and secure means of subsistence.&#13;
Accounting Price of Capital&#13;
ix.      Since the ways of measuring incentives and comparative cost advantage&#13;
of pricing policies which have economy-wide effects do not necessarily involve&#13;
discounting, there may be no need to estimate the accounting rate of interest&#13;
except for normative purposes. Instead an annual value of capital in various&#13;
uses has to be estimated. This can be done by calculating the depreciation and&#13;
decomposing it into its traded and non-traded components and valuing them&#13;
accordingly. Profit was ignored in the case studies for reasons of time and&#13;
simplicity. This simplification is not thought to have distorted the analysis&#13;
significantly.&#13;
Summary Measures of Incentives/Disincentives&#13;
x.         Four coefficients were used to measure the incentive/disincentive&#13;
effects of administered prices, taxes and subsidies to producers. These are:&#13;
-- Nominal Protection Coefficient (NPC), which is the&#13;
ratio of the domestic price to its border price&#13;
(measured at the farmgate).&#13;
-- Effective Protection Coefficient (EPC), which meas-&#13;
ures the effects of protection measures, not only&#13;
on traded outputs but also on traded inputs, i.e.&#13;
the ratio of value added expressed in domestic&#13;
market prices to value added expressed in border&#13;
prices.&#13;
-  Effective Subsidy Coefficient (ESC) in which the&#13;
EPC is adjusted by the sum of the difference&#13;
between profits, taxes, interest and the price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-viii-&#13;
of non-traded goods actually paid and what is&#13;
considered to be "normal charges", i.e. the&#13;
value of direct and implied subsidies.&#13;
--  Producer Subsidy Equivalent (PSE), which is&#13;
the subsidy, net of indirect taxes, given to&#13;
producers, expressed as a percentage of the&#13;
market value of each commodity.&#13;
xi.       The results of the country case studies show in all the countries stud-&#13;
ied, that while there have been some variations over time, the NPCs, the EPCs and&#13;
the ESCs are typically less than one and the PSEs are typically negative, indicat-&#13;
ing disincentives to the production of the main crops included in the study, and&#13;
to agricultural production in general. The results of the country case studies&#13;
also indicate that for agricultural products, where the value of the purchased&#13;
inputs are typically a small proportion of the value of output, there are in-&#13;
significant differences between the NPCs, EPCs and ESCs. This is an important&#13;
finding because EPCs and ESCs are much more difficult to calculate and one can&#13;
rely on NPCs, which are easy to calculate, to obtain estimates of the incentive/-&#13;
disincentive effects of trade taxes and subsidies.&#13;
Summary Measures of Comparative Cost Advantage&#13;
xii.      Two basic efficiency measures can be used to measure the comparative&#13;
cost advantage of producing various agricultural products and by inference&#13;
agricultural products in general vis-a-vis other commodities, but both measures&#13;
have the same foundation:&#13;
-- Domestic Resource Cost (DRC), which can be expressed&#13;
either as a coefficient or as a percentage. In its&#13;
original formulation it is obtained by computing the&#13;
value of domestic resources (primary, non-traded&#13;
factors of production) in domestic currency units,&#13;
it takes to earn or save a unit of foreign exchange.&#13;
Expressed as a coefficient it can be compared to an&#13;
accounting price (shadow price) of foreign exchange.&#13;
If the DRC for a product is less than the appropriate&#13;
accounting price of foreign exchange a comparative&#13;
cost advantage exists in producing the commodity in&#13;
question and vice versa. If both the numerator and&#13;
the denominator are expressed in the same numeraire,&#13;
e.g. border prices, then the coefficient which re-&#13;
sults is essentially the same as the Net Economic&#13;
Benefit, but with the terms arranged differently.&#13;
-- Net Economic Benefit (NEB), is another way of look-&#13;
ing at the comparative advantage in terms of econo-&#13;
mic efficiency, using a time-collapsed form of the&#13;
Little-Mirrlees/Squire-van der Tak methodology,&#13;
without applying social weights. For this reason&#13;
it is probably preferable to the DRC because it is&#13;
in conformity with the Bank's own cost-benefit method-&#13;
ology for projects. It is also simpler to estimate&#13;
and less arbitrary in that one does not have to worry&#13;
about which items to put in the numerator and which&#13;
in the denominator.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-ix-&#13;
xiii.     Where the land and labor requirements for different crops within speci-&#13;
fic areas do not vary substantially, the main determinants of the DRC and NEB are&#13;
relative yields and relative border prices. Hence, in such circumstances one can&#13;
simplify the analysis of comparative advantage by reference to a comparison of&#13;
the border price multiplied by the yield for each crop. Where, however, there&#13;
are significant differences in land and labor inputs full DRC and NEB calcula-&#13;
tions have to be made. The experience of the country case studies is that these&#13;
calculations are made much easier if there exist already sets of national para-&#13;
meters (accounting prices, conversion factors and commodity cost profiles). Thus&#13;
the requirements for agricultural sector price analysis (and other sectors as&#13;
well) and project cost-benefit analysis coincide.&#13;
xiv.        It is interesting to contrast the Producer Subsidy Equivalents (PSEs)&#13;
with Consumer Subsidy Equivalents (CSEs).    Whereas in the more developed coun-&#13;
tries PSEs are positive and CSEs are negative, the reverse is generally true in&#13;
developing countries: farmers are taxed and they pay for the often considerable&#13;
consumer subsidies, from which some of them benefit in part.&#13;
Economic Gains and Losses and Welfare Transfers&#13;
xv.     PSEs and CSEs are a simplified form of a partial equilibrium method-&#13;
ology derived from the theory of consumers' and producers' surplus. Although the&#13;
theory of economic surplus has its well-known limitations, nevertheless, as Hicks&#13;
has commented: "While it is easy to raise objections to the use of the concept&#13;
of economic surplus for providing answers for policy formulation, it is diffi-&#13;
cult to find workable alternatives." (Hicks, p. 791 of "The Rehabiliation of&#13;
Consumers Surplus". Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 8, Feb., 1960-61.) There&#13;
are also practical problems, the most important of which are estimating reason-&#13;
ably accurate demand and supply elasticities. Nevertheless, such estimates are&#13;
available for a large number of countries, and, subsequent to the country case&#13;
studies, calculations of the "Net Economic Loss in Production",l/ the "Net&#13;
Economic Loss in Consumption", the "Welfare Gain to Producers", the "Welfare&#13;
Gain to Consumers", the "Change in Foreign Exchange Earnings" and the "Change in&#13;
Government Revenue" for a limited number of agricultural products in Argentina,&#13;
Eygpt, Kenya, Pakistan, Portugal, Thailand and Yugoslavia were made. These&#13;
calculations confirm the broad picture of discrimination against agriculture and&#13;
of net welfare transfers for agricultural producers to consumers and, to a lesser&#13;
extent, to other producers via the government.&#13;
xvi.      The partial equilibrium framework briefly described above was also&#13;
used to evaluate foodgrain policies in a different group of developing coun-&#13;
tries with the difference that an index of cost effectiveness in terms of nutri-&#13;
tional needs was used. This is defined as the ratio between the total amount of&#13;
foodgrains distributed through the rationing systems and the amount reaching the&#13;
population below the FAO/WHO calorie requirement. The results show (a) that&#13;
government intervention never closes more than 50% of the potential nutrition&#13;
gap; (b) that the costs of distribution are borne partly by producers (through&#13;
the loss in producers' surplus due to procurement at less than border prices)&#13;
and partly by the government; and (c) that, with the exception of Sri Lanka,&#13;
1/ The literature generally refers to these as the "Net Social Loss in Pro-&#13;
duction, etc.", but we prefer to call it "economic" rather than "social" in&#13;
order to distinguish the economic from the social.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the loss of producers' surplus per unit of additional consumption of the mal-&#13;
nourished is equal to or greater than the corresponding fiscal cost. In all&#13;
cases, the sheer magnitude of the losses imply that the food procurement and&#13;
distribution policies could stand considerable improvement, both because of high&#13;
production losses and because of leakages of benefits from low food prices to un-&#13;
intended beneficiaries.&#13;
Evaluation of Methodologies&#13;
xvii.     While the informal, partial equilibrium methodologies employed have&#13;
their limitations and drawbacks, used with discretion they can illuminate some of&#13;
the efficiency effects on agricultural production and broad welfare transfers&#13;
from agriculture to consumers, and to other sectors through governments. A number&#13;
of short-cuts are feasible and sufficiently accurate for broad-brush analysis.&#13;
Thus, for agricultural products in developing countries, where input costs are a&#13;
relatively small proportion of output values, incentive/disincentive effects can&#13;
be measured by nominal protection coefficients alone. This is fortunate because&#13;
NPCs are much easier to calculate than EPCs or ESCs. Where the land and labor&#13;
requirements within specified agro-ecological zones do not differ very much as&#13;
between different crops, the comparative - cost advantages of different crops can&#13;
be measured by comparing relative yields and relative border prices. However,&#13;
where land and labor requirements do differ DRCs or, preferably, NEBs have to be&#13;
estimated. This task would be greatly faciliated if country sets of national&#13;
parameters (accounting prices, conversion factors and crop profiles), updated&#13;
periodically, were made available. Such national parameters are required not&#13;
only for policy analysis but also for project analysis.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
xviii.    Research has shown that market interventions have moved the domestic&#13;
terms of trade substantially against agriculture in many developing countries to&#13;
the detriment of farmer's income, foreign exchange earnings and food production.&#13;
This has particularly important implications for the fight against poverty and&#13;
for the growing world food shortage. It implies that governments should review&#13;
and evaluate their intervention policies, and aid agencies, including the World&#13;
Bank, should assist them to do so. In turn this probably implies that agricul-&#13;
tural policy analysis and sector work generally should receive priority over&#13;
other forms of country economic and sector work. A large part of the invest-&#13;
ment in research and extension and the transfer of knowledge and technologies&#13;
through technical assistance and through projects and programs will continue to&#13;
be thwarted if farmers are not given reasonable incentives to produce food and&#13;
fibers in accordance with relative factor endowments and comparative cost advant-&#13;
ages. This paper concludes with a brief outline of a three-stage recommended&#13;
program of analysis.&#13;

EVALUATING METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING&#13;
EFFICIENCY EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL PRICE INTERVENTION&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.        The objective of this paper is to present methodologies for the&#13;
evaluation of agricultural price intervention in developing countries. This&#13;
presentation of suggested methodologies is based in turn upon a description and&#13;
an evaluation of the use of micro-economic, informal methodologies used in six&#13;
country case studies (Argentina, Egypt, Kenya, Pakistan, Thailand and Yugo-&#13;
slavia) 1/ of agricultural prices, taxes and subsidies, which formed part of a&#13;
wider World Bank Research Project, which commenced late in 1971. 2/ The&#13;
research has confirmed that there is extensive interference by governments in&#13;
developing countries with market forces which has turned the domestic terms of&#13;
trade against agriculture--severely so in many countries--with adverse con-&#13;
sequences in terms of economic efficiency and income distribution. 3/ This&#13;
discrimination against agriculture in developing countries is in marked&#13;
contrast to the over-generous treatment of agriculture in most of the more&#13;
developed countries.&#13;
2.        Given the bias against agriculture and the unsatisfactory and often&#13;
internally inconsistent agricultural pricing policies in most developing&#13;
countries, the methodologies presented here may prove useful (a) to provide&#13;
Bank staff with operationally useful instruments of analysis; (b) to offer&#13;
appropriate advice to client country governments and their planning institutions&#13;
concerned with pricing policies; and (c) to help bridge the methodological gap&#13;
between project cost-benefit analysis on the one hand and sector and country&#13;
economic work on the other hand. 4/ It is recognized that there are difficult&#13;
communication and education problems in convincing policy makers in developing&#13;
countries to make their development policies less discriminatory against&#13;
1/   Some of these methodologies were also used in a Bank study of four&#13;
West African countries (Ivory Coast, Ghana, Mali and Senegal).&#13;
See "Methodology of the Western Africa Study", February 6, 1976&#13;
and the four country case study by Balassa and Associates, unpublished&#13;
mimeographs.&#13;
2/   For an outline of the raison d'etre of the study and its various elements,&#13;
use the Prologue to this paper. Formal agricultural Sector Models were&#13;
used to study the situations in Mexico and Brazil, but this paper does&#13;
not attempt to evaluate these or to compare the formal with the informal&#13;
methods.&#13;

their effects see a companion paper: "Agricultural Prices, Subsidies&#13;
and Taxes: A Review of Experience", prepared by Gilbert Brown and&#13;
Graham Donaldson.&#13;

agriculture in terms of both economic efficiency and income distribution. We&#13;
can hope only that this paper will make a contribution towards providing a&#13;
better basis for communication and for education.&#13;
3.        It is also recognized that applying the type of analysis and method-&#13;
ologies proposed is not costless in terms of the time needed to be devoted to&#13;
such work by country, sector and project economists: if more time is spent on&#13;
such agricultural policy analysis, almost certainly less will be spent on&#13;
other activities. On the other hand, we would argue, the marginal net benefits&#13;
from this type of work is higher than that of much of the current activities&#13;
of operational economists and would be more operationally useful and supportive&#13;
of the Bank's development objectives and lending operations.&#13;
4.        The paper concentrates on the efficiency aspects of agricultural&#13;
price intervention. This is more by reason of the inadequate data base in&#13;
most developing countries, and the consequent difficulty the researchers&#13;
found in tracing through all the income distribution effects of the market&#13;
interventions, rather than by choice. There are also other important aspects&#13;
not covered here, such as the effects upon employment, institutions and agri-&#13;
cultural research. Neither do we examine the constraints on changing policies,&#13;
such as the need to devise alternative, less discriminatory and more equitable&#13;
ways for governments to raise revenue. Instead this paper concentrates on&#13;
pricing issues, some of which can be tackled by the new cost benefit methods of&#13;
economic efficiency pricing.&#13;
5.        In Section II, market interventions are characterized as inducing&#13;
distortions from a system of reference or accounting prices, and this section&#13;
illustrates the problems involved in using border prices as a reference point&#13;
for traded goods. Section III discusses ways of computing accounting prices&#13;
for non-traded goods/factors. Section IV presents concepts and definitions&#13;
related to summary indicators of comparative advantage and incentives.&#13;
Section V discusses implications of cross-country evidence on price distortion&#13;
and general trends emerging from a set of empirical estimates, on the basis of&#13;
a more general partial equilibrium methodology based on the theory of consumers&#13;
and producers' surplus which is first described. While a number of qualitative&#13;
approaches to the study of agricultural pricing are also discussed, the main&#13;
focus of this section is on quantitative partial equilibrium methods and on&#13;
illustrative applications for a sample of developing countries. Section V&#13;
evaluates the usefulness of the various methodologies used, and the paper ends&#13;
with putting forward some general guidelines for analyzing agricultural price&#13;
interventions. The paper is complemented by four appendices detailing the&#13;
theory underlying the methodology proposed, some of the numerical components&#13;
of the estimates presented in the main text, and the sources of the theoretical&#13;
and empirical material used.&#13;

II.  MEASURING MARKET DISTORTIONS:   ACCOUNTING PRICES&#13;
FOR TRADEABLES&#13;
6.        This paper makes an assessment of agricultural price intervention on&#13;
the basis of three premises: (a) price interventions are widely used in almost&#13;
all countries; (b) governments will continue to find it useful to use a&#13;
variety of such price interventions in the future; and (c) that the use of&#13;
some interventions is a legitimate option of governments provided they are&#13;
internally consistent and provided their consequences in terms of economic&#13;
efficiency and income distribution have been analyzed in some detail.&#13;
7.        There are, however, two corollaries of (c).   First, there must&#13;
be a much better data base or information system plus a system for monitoring&#13;
and evaluating the effects of price interventions. Secondly, there has to be&#13;
a system of reference points against which the effects of market interventions&#13;
can be assessed in terms of development objectives. Border prices -- foreign&#13;
prices converted into a country's currency units by applying the official&#13;
exchange rate -- are used in this paper as such reference points. It is not&#13;
argued here that border prices are perfect reference points, but they are used&#13;
to judge the rationality of national pricing systems for two main reasons:&#13;
(a) except for the prices of an arbitrary group of trading partners (such as a&#13;
common market, a free trade area, etc.) no other common, observable system of&#13;
market values exists that can be used to compare prices of different countries;&#13;
(b) from the point of view of the individual country, border prices represent&#13;
the true opportunity costs of the country's tradeables. Where imports are not&#13;
expected to affect the foreign supply price or exports the foreign demand&#13;
price, the appropriate border prices to use are the projected c.i.f. import&#13;
and f.o.b. export prices. Where, however, an increased demand for imports&#13;
would, at the margin, affect the supply price or where the increased supply of&#13;
exports would, at the margin, affect the foreign demand price--i.e., the&#13;
demand and supply are less than perfectly elastic, the appropriate prices to&#13;
use are the projected marginal import cost or marginal export revenue. The&#13;
former is the c.i.f. price multiplied by (1+1/e) where (e) is the elasticity&#13;
for foreign supply; the latter is the f.o.b. export price multiplied by (1+1/n),&#13;
where (n) is the elasticity of foreign demand.&#13;
8.        While existing international markets can provide a useful standard&#13;
against which to measure economic performance, it is also important to underline&#13;
some of the limitations and problems that go along with such an approach.&#13;
First, identifying the appropriate border prices is often difficult where&#13;
products are heterogeneous. In agriculture, however, agricultural products are&#13;
typically much more homogenous than most industrial products. Nevertheless&#13;
care has to be exercised to ensure that the border prices are taken for&#13;
basically comparable produce in terms of quality and use. Second, where&#13;
international prices fluctuate quite widely, it is difficult to select an&#13;
appropriate trend price in real terms. Third, there are a number of problems&#13;
connected with the fact that world prices, and hence border prices, are not&#13;
free-trade prices, but prices which are often distorted by monopsonistic&#13;
situations in other supplying countries, by trade barriers and pricing policies,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
by dumping and by other imperfections in world markets. Some of these distor-&#13;
tions have resulted in some agricultural produce being produced in the wrong&#13;
places -- sugar beet growing in developed countries is a classic example. In&#13;
these senses, border prices are themselves often distorted, so how can they&#13;
be used as reference prices? The answer to this question depends upon one's&#13;
viewpoint. From a global point of view one might not want to take international&#13;
prices as one's reference point in many instances, although it is far from&#13;
clear what reference points one would substitute for them. Looked at it from&#13;
the point of view of each individual country, however, it is irrelevent that&#13;
some international/border prices may be monopsonistic, dumped or otherwise&#13;
distorted ones: what matters is whether or not they are true and lasting&#13;
trading options. For example, most milk powder entering into international&#13;
trade is dumped, but from the point of view of a country deciding whether or not&#13;
to go ahead with a domestic liquid milk production project, the relevant question&#13;
is not whether milk powder is dumped, but whether the dumping is likely to&#13;
continue over the estimated life of the project. If it is, then the border&#13;
price of reconstituted milk from imported milk powder is the appropriate oppor-&#13;
tunity cost of liquid milk. If not, then the appropriate price to take is the&#13;
economic value of the domestic milk production, valuing the traded components at&#13;
their border priced opportunity costs and including depreciation and profit&#13;
elements.&#13;
9.        Thus, while border prices are not always and everywhere the most&#13;
appropriate accounting prices to use, in general they do appear to capture&#13;
the real opportunities open to countries through trade and thus provide a&#13;
convenient reference point.&#13;
10.       There are four ways in which border prices can be used to evaluate a&#13;
country's system of domestic prices and to formulate policy recommendations.&#13;
First, trade prices can be used to evaluate the rationality of the pattern of&#13;
specialization of a country in the light of its trading opportunities. Second,&#13;
they can be adjusted to producing points and compared to producer (farmgate)&#13;
prices to evaluate the consistency of private and public incentives in production.&#13;
Differences between prices faced by domestic producers and prices faced by&#13;
publicly-run marketing boards, export-import agencies, and similar agencies in&#13;
international markets imply differences in the rates of investment in the&#13;
various sectors of the economy and may have important consequences for the&#13;
long-run pattern of specialization of the country, as well as on the balance&#13;
between the public and the private sector. Third, consumer prices and border&#13;
prices can be compared to provide insights into the pattern of consumption&#13;
forced upon the country by government market interventions. Fourth, the&#13;
deviation between domestic and international prices for commodities or sectors&#13;
in the same country can be used to evaluate internal distortions in the domestic&#13;
terms of trade between such commodities or sectors (e.g. between agriculture and&#13;
industry).&#13;
11.       In all cases, a systematic comparison of international prices and&#13;
domestic market values can provide the basis for an analysis of consistency&#13;
between instruments and targets of government policies. While the principle&#13;
that the price system should serve national goals is generally accepted, it is&#13;
clear that most countries have developed over the years fragmentary and&#13;
chaotic systems of subsidies and taxes. For many countries the prevailing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
market "distortions" may not be related to present goals, and in many cases it&#13;
has been shown that they run counter to present goals. Thus, without denying&#13;
the possibility of market interventions, we suggest that international border&#13;
prices be considered the most convenient benchmark to design more rational&#13;
policies.&#13;
12.       Although the origin of market distortions can be traced to actions&#13;
of the government or private entities or to specific deficiencies of the&#13;
market system, the ultimate effect of the distortion is by no means easy to&#13;
identify or measure. The main difficulty is that, despite the importance of&#13;
pricing for planning and policy making, designing market intervention policies&#13;
is a process often occurring under the severe constraint of many pre-existing&#13;
distortions. These distortions are in part due to factors outside government&#13;
control and in part are the direct results of past actions taken by the&#13;
government. In all cases they permeate the existing price system, so that the&#13;
first logical step of any attempt at designing market intervention policies&#13;
must depend on the identification and measurement of their net effect.&#13;
13.       Market interventions can be looked at from two viewpoints.   First,&#13;
they can be measured as the end result of all interactions with the free play&#13;
of market forces. Second, their impact on selected important characteristics&#13;
of the economy can be quantified. In both cases a quantitative evaluation&#13;
requires estimates of the effects of the distortions on a distortion-free&#13;
pricing system and, indirectly on the pattern of allocations of resources,&#13;
incomes and consumption. For this purpose, as in cost-benefit analysis, a&#13;
system of accounting (shadow) prices 1/ and conversions factors is necessary.&#13;
The accounting prices and conversion factors used in the country case studies&#13;
and hence our description of them, were based more on the Little-Mirrlees&#13;
(L-M) 2/ and Squire-van der Tak (S-T) 3/ methodologies than on the UNIDO&#13;
methodology. 4/ This is because the World Bank has opted for the former&#13;
rather than the latter, but it is generally agreed now that, provided the&#13;
basic economic analysis is the same, in most practical situations the two&#13;
methodologies give the same accept/reject decisions.&#13;
1/   We prefer to use "accounting prices" rather than "shadow prices", as&#13;
the latter has a connotation of something ephemeral, vague, unreal and&#13;
esoteric, and seems to induce negative reactions in some people.&#13;

14.       The analogy with the process of accounting pricing used in project&#13;
cost benefit analysis may be useful in clarifying some of the characteristics&#13;
of the systems of accounting prices sought. Cost benefit analysis can itself&#13;
be conceived as a pricing process where rules are sought to impute "undistorted"&#13;
prices to outputs and inputs of a particular class of projects. Since price&#13;
policies represent an attempt to impose prices on all market transactions of&#13;
a particular class, using accounting prices for cost-benefit analysis is thus&#13;
a special type of pricing policy - one whose ultimate intention is to reduce&#13;
some of the consequences of existing distortions.&#13;
15.       Despite such a close resemblance, there are two important differences&#13;
between the two pricing methods that make cost benefit analysis a particularly&#13;
simple sub-case of the more general pricing problem. First, accounting prices&#13;
in cost benefit analysis are used to impute money values to predetermined&#13;
bundles of outputs and inputs. Because the projects being appraised are both&#13;
small and few as compared with the allocative decisions guided by market&#13;
prices, accounting prices have only marginal effects on resource allocation in&#13;
the rest of the economy. Government pricing policies, on the other hand, are&#13;
likely to have a major impact on resource allocation, investment decisions&#13;
and, indeed, project appraisal criteria of private and public economic units.&#13;
Second, project appraisal techniques may either assume away the fiscal impli-&#13;
cations of the accounting prices adopted, or they may consider fiscal measures&#13;
as independent of the net economic benefits estimated. Clearly this is not&#13;
possible in the case of economy-wide prices, and accounting prices based on&#13;
border prices have to be confronted with their fiscal consequences. This is&#13;
also true of cost-benefit analysis where the project financial analysis indicates&#13;
a deficit.&#13;
16.       The selection of a reference system of accounting prices depends&#13;
on four main factors: (i) the extent of the policy measures evaluated; (ii)&#13;
the nature of the economic system and the development pattern of the country;&#13;
(iii) the national goals sought by the government; and (iv) the relationship&#13;
between the country's economy and its (actual or potential) trade partners.&#13;
17.       On the first point, although in principle the government can be&#13;
held responsible for many, if not most, of the existing distortions - in the&#13;
sense that it is the direct cause of such distortions or could make efforts to&#13;
remove them - in practice there will be a number of market imperfections or&#13;
existing policies beyond the control of government. Also if the sector&#13;
directly affected by the policy measure is large, the number of taxes and&#13;
subsidies substantial, or the impact of the contemplated intervention far&#13;
reaching, pricing recommendations should be directed to offset some of the&#13;
undesirable effects of other distortions and to improve the efficiency and&#13;
equity features of the economy. This is a very complex task and can only rest&#13;
on a careful case-by-case economic and social analysis of each country. When&#13;
it cannot be accomplished without the danger of generating further negative&#13;
effects on the economy, international and/or equilibrium domestic prices still&#13;
provide a "least imperfect" norm. Discrete changes of large magnitude,&#13;
however, will significantly change the accounting prices of domestic resources&#13;
and of foreign exchange. More will be said on this account in the part of the&#13;
paper discussing ways of computing these accounting prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
18.       On the second and third points, patterns of development in countries&#13;
may differ greatly in the emphasis given to accelerated growth, income distri-&#13;
bution, industrialization, the weight of the export sector, the importance of&#13;
the internal markets, and so on. Often national goals as seen by the government,&#13;
or as expressed in the national plan, are a rationalization of a particular&#13;
pattern of past development. The importance of prices in this context is that&#13;
they can be used to provide incentives to the private sector and partly to the&#13;
public sector to achieve specific growth targets or in a manner broadly consis-&#13;
tent with the model of development sought for the country. Patterns of develop-&#13;
ment and growth targets determine the level of some key prices for domestic or&#13;
foreign resources: wages, interests, rental rates and exchange rates.&#13;
19.       Finally, the relationship between the country and its actual and&#13;
potential trade partners needs close scrutiny before a system of reference&#13;
prices can be chosen. With the possible exceptions of Hong Kong and Singapore,&#13;
no country has moved to a completely free trading position. Across countries,&#13;
multilateral and bilateral trade agreements and geographical and political&#13;
constraints shape trade patterns and limit the scope for substitution and&#13;
competition. Thus border prices are true measures of the country's opportunity&#13;
costs, if they take account of likely changes in distortions and of the volumes&#13;
of trade and the markets involved. Similarly, border price-based marginal&#13;
revenues for goods with finite elasticity rest on the hypothesis that the&#13;
country's trade partners will tolerate the imposition of a tariff without&#13;
retaliation.&#13;
20.       All the above considerations suggest that there exists no absolutely&#13;
unique system of accounting prices for use in policy formation. For most&#13;
countries, however, the rule for specifying accounting prices for cost-benefit&#13;
analysis are adequate to provide: (i) a benchmark to judge the extent of&#13;
price distortions involved in the current system of market interventions; and&#13;
(ii) to suggest a gradual and complete removal of all these distortions where&#13;
this is deemed to be feasible and consistent with the national goals.&#13;

III. MEASURING MARKET DISTORTIONS: ACCOUNTING PRICES&#13;
FOR NON-TRADEABLES&#13;
21.       If it is accepted as a general rule that border prices provide the&#13;
appropriate reference point for tradeables, what about non-tradeables? The&#13;
rule here is that non-traded goods should be broken down once, and probably&#13;
only once in practice, into their traded and non-traded elements, with the&#13;
traded elements valued directly at their border prices. 1/ All non-traded&#13;
elements should, in theory, be valued as the weighted average of the values of&#13;
the factor marginal productivities in the production of all products using the&#13;
factors as inputs. In practice, of course, not all activities can be taken&#13;
into account and a "representative" or "typical" activity is taken. The&#13;
marginal value product of the input factors are then revalued at their border&#13;
price equivalent values by applying appropriate conversion factors, such as a&#13;
consumption conversion factor for labor. 2/&#13;
22.       Estimating the accounting prices of labor, land and capital presents&#13;
some specific problems due to the fact that wages and interest rate levels,&#13;
particularly, relate to four areas of government concern: (i) employment,&#13;
(ii) growth, (iii) inflation, and (iv) income distribution. Government's&#13;
preferences and objectives in these areas could find direct expression in&#13;
"merit want" accounting prices for labor, land and capital. In general,&#13;
however, although it may be quite unrealistic to expect policy makers to be&#13;
able to translate their targets into price variables, policy recommendations&#13;
on factor prices can be based on an opportunity cost criterion and appropriately&#13;
modified to reflect policy choices.&#13;
Accounting Price of Labor&#13;
23.       Consider first the accounting price for labor.    The pricing prescrip-&#13;
tion of project cost-benefit analysis is based on four points. First, as for&#13;
all inputs, the opportunity cost of employing one additional unit of a particular&#13;
skill depends on the value of the product foregone in its alternative uses.&#13;
In general such a value is a weighted average of marginal products evaluated&#13;
at border prices, the weights being the marginal shares of labor in each of&#13;
these alternative. Second, the giving of a wage represents committing social&#13;
income to consumption. If the government has a high target rate of growth or&#13;
1/   This process of decomposition is made much easier if a set of national&#13;
parameters (conversion factors and accounting prices) for a country is&#13;
available, as grouped or individual conversion factors can be applied to&#13;
relatively unimportant tradeables, rather than hunting for the appropriate&#13;
direct border prices. See, for example, National Parameters for Project&#13;
Appraisal in Malaysia in 3 vols. State and Rural Development Project,&#13;
Economic Planning Unit, Prime Minister's Department, Kuala Lumpur,&#13;
November 1977 and June 1979, prepared by Michael Veitch and Hamzah Bakar.&#13;
2/   It should be noted that if, for example, the UNIDO methodology is being&#13;
used, the estimated marginal value products of non-traded inputs will&#13;
already be expressed in the UNIDO numeraire -- domestic prices -- so&#13;
no further conversions are required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
a low target rate of inflation, a penalty should be charged to incorporate the&#13;
cost to society of increased consumption. Alternatively, an expansionary&#13;
policy of increasing aggregate demand would give a premium to wage earners for&#13;
their high propensity to consume. Third, a wage commits social income to&#13;
subgroups of individuals so that a premium (or penalty) may also incorporate&#13;
income distribution preferences for a particular group of workers. Fourth,&#13;
the wage remunerates a labor effort that requires the worker to forego leisure,&#13;
to modify his quality of life, to alter his consumption basket, etc. Thus, a&#13;
lower bound to labor opportunity cost is an evaluation of workers' foregone&#13;
welfare (the "reservation" wage). These aspects of the accounting price for&#13;
labor are summarized in the following equation for the conversion factor for&#13;
labor:&#13;
CF  = [MO + AC$ - aC d /v] &#13;
c      c       2.  w&#13;
where:   CF    =      conversion factor for labor   accounting price for labor&#13;
market price for labor&#13;
M          marginal product of labor at domestic prices&#13;
ac         conversion factor for consumption&#13;
AC    =     increase in consumption valued at domestic prices&#13;
dg   =     weighted average income distribution coefficient&#13;
v    =     social value of public income relative to private consumption&#13;
w    =     market wage rate.&#13;
21.       The first term of equation (1) is simply the value of the marginal&#13;
product of labor in the next best alternative use, measured at border prices.&#13;
The second term is the value of-the increased consumption at border prices.&#13;
It is a cost in terms of foreign exchange foregone and, therefore, added to&#13;
the marginal product. It is also a benefit; hence the third term is the&#13;
social value of the extra consumption and, therefore, is subtracted. It is the&#13;
value of the consumption at domestic prices multiplied by an income distribution&#13;
weight and divided by the value of public income coefficient to express the&#13;
benefit in terms of the numeraire being used. If there is no premium attached&#13;
to public income v=l/Oc   and, if benefits are not differentially valued,   d = 8 v&#13;
and equation (1) collapses to   CF. = M 8 /w , which is what was used in the&#13;
country case studies. Additional terms can be added to equation (1) if the&#13;
disutility of effort and migration effects are considered important. The&#13;
country case studies assumed (a) a lower bound for CF. equal to an estimated&#13;
reservation wage and (b) that migration was not important in the agricultural&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
Accounting Price of Land&#13;
22.       Not unlike labor, land is a basic depository of value and productive&#13;
potential for agriculture.   Its value is difficult to assess since it is not&#13;
only a production factor, but also an asset and related markets are often&#13;
thin, unreliable and complex.   On the one hand, land markets in developing&#13;
countries are not very active as land in the hands of poor people is scarce&#13;
and they tend to hold on to it as the only secure means of subsistence. On&#13;
the other hand, the market for land services tend to reflect often complex&#13;
land tenurial institutions and distortions in the labor markets, so that&#13;
rental rates are not necessarily related either to the price of land or to its&#13;
marginal products.&#13;
23.       Because land is also held as a hedge against inflation, and a pre-&#13;
cautionary reserve of wealth, land accounting prices should take into account&#13;
the availability of markets for alternative assets, the structure of the&#13;
interest rates and the rate of inflation. Land taxation is often desirable to&#13;
discourage (i) underutilization of productive land, (ii) rent accumulation,&#13;
and (iii) use of landownership as a base of political power. Although difficult&#13;
to enforce in practice, land taxation may also be an effective instrument to&#13;
appropriate agricultural surplus. It can also be made neutral as between&#13;
competing uses, thus avoiding distortions between different cropping patterns,&#13;
and it can be made progressive and more equitable.&#13;
24.       The "reference" accounting price for land should be, as in the case&#13;
of labor, the opportunity cost given by its marginal product evaluated at&#13;
border price plus a component reflecting its function as a depository of&#13;
value. If renters save more than workers, this component may be positive when&#13;
the government is committed to growth and higher savings are at a premium over&#13;
consumption. Income distribution weighting of the marginal product and the&#13;
asset component, however, may induce substantial modifications in the overall&#13;
result.&#13;
Accounting Price of Capital&#13;
25.       While in project appraisal the accounting price of capital is basically&#13;
used to discount future benefits and costs, when we examine the more general&#13;
pricing issue, several other possibilities arise. First, an accounting interest&#13;
rate may be useful to evaluate the interest rate prevailing in domestic markets&#13;
as a consequence of government fiscal and monetary policy. Second, it may be&#13;
used to judge the optimality of foreign and domestic borrowing by the government.&#13;
Third, it may be used to evaluate the productivity of the investment undertaken&#13;
by the government.&#13;
26.       The accounting rate of interest (ARI) is defined as the rate of fall&#13;
over time of the value of public sector income measured at border prices. If&#13;
savings and consumption are considered to have equal value and income distri-&#13;
bution considerations are neglected, such a value is the same as the marginal&#13;
product of capital of government investment (q) measured at border prices:&#13;
ARI = qa                                                         (2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
where:&#13;
q = marginal product of capital of government&#13;
investment at domestic prices&#13;
a = a border price conversion factor for investment.&#13;
More generally, however the ARI is calculated applying the formula.&#13;
Av = ARI - CRI                                                    (3)&#13;
where CRI is the consumption rate of interest and measures&#13;
how much more valuable is a unit of consumption now rather&#13;
than a year hence, and Av is the rate of fall of the value&#13;
of the public sector income at border prices relative to&#13;
private consumption. Since CRI expresses the rate of fall&#13;
in value of private consumption over time, expression (2)&#13;
is an identity as it simply states that the rate of fall&#13;
of the value of public sector income relative to private&#13;
consumption is the difference between the rate of fall of&#13;
the value of the first variable (i.e. public sector income)&#13;
minus the rate of fall of the value of the second variable&#13;
(i.e. private consumption).&#13;
27.       In practice the CRI is estimated using a formula based on one&#13;
objective parameter, the growth rate in per capita income g, and two subjective&#13;
ones: the elasticity of marginal utility of income n and the rate of pure&#13;
time preference e:&#13;
CRI  =  ng + e                                                    (4)&#13;
Together these three factors fully account for the rate of fall of the welfare&#13;
value of private consumption over time since "(a) if people are richer in the&#13;
future, the additional rupee of consumption will not mean the same to them" 1/&#13;
and, (b) people attach a premium to enjoying things today rather than in the&#13;
future, even if their income stays the same.&#13;
28.       As for the other terms of expression (2), q. is measured as the rate&#13;
of return on the "marginal" government investment, while ARI is estimated as a&#13;
residual. The ARI, of course, is the rate of discount which should be applied&#13;
to all investments whose inputs and outputs have been evaluated at the account-&#13;
ing prices illustrated above. In economy-wide terms, it also represents a&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
long-run rate to which the domestic interest rate may be compared to judge its&#13;
optimality.&#13;
29.       Use of the ARI, of course, is specially relevant where the discount-&#13;
ing of costs and benefits can be done. In analyzing the effects of agricultural&#13;
price interventions, however, where the focus is a broad sector or subsector,&#13;
one cannot discount since the allocative problem concerns the use of existing&#13;
resources, rather than any significant additional investment. The country&#13;
case studies used, amongst other measures, Bruno/Balassa domestic resource&#13;
cost coefficients (DRCs). Here no discounting has been used in practice, and&#13;
hence the DRC is a time-collapsed coefficient. As Hansen puts it: "the&#13;
capital costs of a project can usefully be viewed from two perspectives for&#13;
shadow pricing. For lack of better terms, let us call them the asset and the&#13;
rent components. When Rs. 100,000 is invested in project X, for example, two&#13;
things happen. First, Rs. 100,000 of financial resources is converted into&#13;
real physical assets. Secondly, the investor removes Rs. 100,000 worth of&#13;
financial resources from the national pool of savings that might be used for&#13;
investment in alternative projects. Once invested in project X, therefore,&#13;
these assets should yield a benefit, or rent, at least equal to what they&#13;
would have otherwise earned." 1/ There is no problem of valuing the real&#13;
assets at their border price or border price equivalent values. From the&#13;
rental point of view, the economic cost of the capital, ignoring any premium&#13;
on savings, is the marginal product of capital. This is typically not easy to&#13;
estimate in practice.&#13;
30.       While a basic reference mark for the evaluation of interest rate&#13;
policies is given by the opportunity cost of capital, the difficulties associated&#13;
with differential inflation rates therefore suggest that more definite indica-&#13;
tions on interest rates would be given by farmers' implicit discounting behavior&#13;
and their implicit or explicit willingness to pay. Equivalent subsidies and&#13;
taxes should be more appropriately judged with reference to these endogenous&#13;
rates.&#13;
31.       Since determining aggregate opportunities from trade does not&#13;
depend, per se, on the welfare function of the country, social considerations&#13;
are of no consequence in determining the required system of primary "accounting"&#13;
prices. As in cost-benefit analysis, however, this system should be viewed&#13;
only as a convenient point of reference and not as a normative yardstick to be&#13;
applied under all circumstances. Thus, social prices can be used to form&#13;
specific goals of, say, growth or equity, and the divergence between them and&#13;
''opportunity" border prices will directly give a measure of the equivalent&#13;
tariff (or subsidy) needed for enforcement. Note, however, that unlike the&#13;
cost-benefit analysis project case, economy-wide social pricing implies&#13;
knowledge of both the consumption pattern of the different income groups and&#13;
their sources of income.&#13;

IV. MEASURING MARKET DISTORTIONS: SUMMARY MEASURES&#13;
31.       Once a system of accounting prices was worked out, the country&#13;
case studies estimated four basic reference coefficients: the nominal pro-&#13;
tection coefficient (NPC), the effective protection coefficient (EPC), the&#13;
effective subsidy coefficient (ESC) and the domestic resource cost (DRC).&#13;
In most cases, the ESC was not used for reasons which will be explained later,&#13;
while in Egypt the net nominal protection coefficient was also calculated.&#13;
In two cases--Egypt and Yugoslavia--these coefficients were supplemented by&#13;
estimating producer surplus equivalent (PSE) and consumer subsidy equivalent&#13;
(CSE) coefficients as in a pilot FAO study. 1/&#13;
Nominal Protection Coefficient (NPC)&#13;
32.       The nominal protection coefficient (NPC) of any commodity is the&#13;
ratio of its domestic producer price to its border price. 2/&#13;
NPC  =   i                          ...    ...                       (5)&#13;
pb&#13;
where     NPC,   =  nominal protection coefficient of the ith commodity&#13;
pd    =  domestic price of the ith commodity&#13;
i&#13;
pbi   =  border price of the ith commodity, with the border&#13;
price being its foreign price times the official rate of&#13;
exchange.&#13;
1/   See T.E. Josling, "Agricultural Protection and Stabilization Policies:&#13;
A Framework of Measurement in the Context of Agricultural Adjustment",&#13;
FAO Mimeograph, October 1975.&#13;
2/   Strictly speaking, it should be worked back to the appropriate producer&#13;
point, i.e., adjusted for internal transport and distributive margins,&#13;
converted to their border price equivalent values, but in practice this&#13;
is not usually done as the differences are unlikely to be great.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
33.       The difference between the domestic producer price and the border&#13;
price of a comparable product is the ad valorem tariff rate 1/ (calculated&#13;
as a percentage on c.i.f. prices), where the product is not subject to&#13;
quantitative restrictions. Where there are quantitative restrictions,&#13;
domestic producer and border prices have to be related directly. Where&#13;
there are differential indirect taxes, the differential tax rates, expressed&#13;
as percentages of c.i.f. prices, have to be added to the tariff rates.&#13;
Thus, if the tariff is 20% of the c.i.f. price and the indirect tax is the&#13;
same for the domestically produced as for the imported commodity, the NPC     1.20.&#13;
But, if the indirect tax is 10% on the domestically produced commodity and 25%&#13;
on the imported commodity, the NPC - 1.20 x 1.25 = 1.36.&#13;
1.10&#13;
34.       The NPC can also be expressed as a percentage difference between&#13;
domestic and border prices, in which case it is called the nominal rate of&#13;
protection (NPR):&#13;
pd   pb&#13;
NPR. =      i1                                          (6)&#13;
pb&#13;
i&#13;
35.       Before defining the EPC and ESC, it is necessary, first, to define&#13;
what is meant by "traded" and non-traded" and by "value added."&#13;
Traded Goods&#13;
36.       Traded goods are those which are either directly imported or&#13;
exported or whose domestic sale (purchase) results in the goods being&#13;
exported (imported) by some person or firm. They are to be valued at their&#13;
f.o.b. export (c.i.f. import) prices so long as the exports (imports) are&#13;
not thought to affect the foreign demand price (foreign supply price).&#13;
Where, however, an increased supply of exports would, at the margin, affect&#13;
the foreign demand price or where an increased demand for imports would,&#13;
at the margin, affect the supply price, i.e., the demand and/or supply are&#13;
less than perfectly elastic, the appropriate border prices to use are the&#13;
projected margin export revenue or the projected marginal import cost.&#13;
Non-Traded Goods&#13;
37.       All those goods which are not traded, are to be broken down into&#13;
their traded and primary non-traded components, with the traded components&#13;
valued at border prices and the primary non-traded goods valued at their&#13;
opportunity costs, and converted into border price equivalent values using&#13;
appropriate conversion factors (see below).&#13;
1/   The expression "tariff" used here includes the ad valorem equivalent&#13;
of specific duties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
Value Added&#13;
38.       Value added is normally defined as the value of the output at any&#13;
point in the production-distribution process in any period, less the value of&#13;
the purchased inputs in the same period, less depreciation. It should be&#13;
noted that, as normally defined in national income accounting terms what is&#13;
subtracted from the value of the output are the purchased inputs which can be&#13;
both traded and non-traded. While one can redefine value added to be the sales&#13;
value less the value of all traded inputs, with the residual being the value of&#13;
all non-traded inputs, where does depreciation fit into this definition?&#13;
Depreciation might represent assets which are both traded and non-traded.&#13;
Strictly speaking depreciation should be split up into its traded and non-traded&#13;
components, but in practice, as in the case studies, it is typically treated as&#13;
traded. Using the traded/ non-traded definition, value added is equivalent to&#13;
the net return to non-traded resources used in producing a good or providing a&#13;
service plus (minus) any surplus (deficit) over and above "normal profit". In&#13;
equilibrium and constant returns to scale this decomposes into the marginal&#13;
value of land, labor and capital: otherwise the decomposition will include an&#13;
economic surplus (deficit).&#13;
39.        Since value added is a residual concept, clearly what is purchased,&#13;
and hence the value added of any commodity, will vary according to the time&#13;
period being considered and the level of analysis, e.g., whether viewed from&#13;
the point of view of the country as a whole, the sector or the farm. It is&#13;
usual in most analysis to take a year (or a crop season); what is purchased&#13;
at the farm level might form part of value added at the sector level, and&#13;
what is purchased at the sector level might form part of value added at the&#13;
national level.&#13;
Effective Protection Coefficient (EPC)&#13;
40.       The effective protection coefficient (EPC) measures the effects of&#13;
protective measures not only on traded outputs but on traded inputs or, to&#13;
put it another way, on value added. It is measured by the ratio of value&#13;
added expressed in domestic market prices to value added expressed in border&#13;
prices:&#13;
EPC   =   Va &#13;
Vab&#13;
I/    This ratio can also be put in a percentage form:&#13;
Vad      Vab&#13;
a_  _        x 100&#13;
Vabi&#13;
in which case it is called the effective rate of protection(EPR).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
where       EPC,  =  effective protection coefficient in the ith activity&#13;
or commodity&#13;
d&#13;
Va1      value added per unit of output in the ith activity&#13;
or commodity at domestic prices&#13;
b&#13;
Va1   =  value added per unit of output in the ith activity or&#13;
commodity at border prices&#13;
This decomposes into its output and input components:&#13;
d    k           d&#13;
p   E  (a  ~P)&#13;
EPCi     b    -k          b                                          (8)&#13;
P1 -      (a     P;)&#13;
j J=1   ij     i&#13;
where         ai    =  quantity of the Jth input used to produce one unit&#13;
of the ith output&#13;
P()      domestic price of output/input for the ith commodity&#13;
im    or jth input&#13;
Pb( ) =  border price of the output/input for the ith commodity&#13;
i(j)  or jth input&#13;
J    =  l...k = all traded inputs, direct and indirect&#13;
41.       If the good which the denominator of (8) refers to is not&#13;
traded, but is potentially tradeable, the question to ask is whether or not&#13;
it is likely to be traded in the future. If it is, then it should be&#13;
treated as a traded good and some estimate made of the c.i.f. (or marginal)&#13;
import or f.o.b. (or marginal) export prices; if it is not, then it should&#13;
be treated as a non-traded good and decomposed into its traded and primary&#13;
non-traded components (see paragraphs 36 and 37 above).&#13;
42.       An EPC &gt; 1 means that, at the existing official exchange rate, pro-&#13;
tection measures provide positive incentives to produce the commodity or&#13;
carry out the activity under consideration, and vice versa, an EPC &lt; 1 indi-&#13;
cates that protective measures discriminate against the commodity in ques-&#13;
tion. An EPC &lt; 0 signifies an absolute loss of foreign exchange to the&#13;
economy. It is important to point out here that an EPC less (greater)&#13;
than one is not necessarily an actual disincentive (incentive), only a&#13;
potential one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
Effective Subsidy Coefficient (ESC)&#13;
43.       The ESC is the EPC adjusted for subsidies.   It is calculated by&#13;
adjusting (+) the numerator of equation (8) by the sum of the difference&#13;
between profits tax, interest and the prices of non-traded goods actually&#13;
paid and what is considered to be "normal" charges, i.e. the value of direct&#13;
and implied subsidies.&#13;
Domestic Resource Cost (DRC)&#13;
44.       The domestic resources cost coefficient (DRC) is an adaptation of&#13;
project evaluation methodology to country-wide policy evaluation. It is obtained&#13;
by computing the cost of foreign exchange saved for imported competing goods and&#13;
the cost of foreign exchange earned for exports. Traded final goods are thus&#13;
evaluated at border prices. Non-traded goods are decomposed into traded inputs&#13;
and non-traded primary factors (domestic resources). The former are evaluated&#13;
at border prices while the latter are evaluated at accounting prices. DRC's are&#13;
then measured as the ratios between the cost of domestic resources (evaluated at&#13;
accounting prices) and net foreign exchange earnings (value of traded ouput&#13;
minus value of traded inputs).&#13;
45.       DRC's can be interpreted as ratios between the cost of a dollar&#13;
earned or saved through domestic production and an accounting rate of exchange.&#13;
For a given commodity i, denoting by Pi its border price, domestic resource&#13;
costs (value added) evaluated at accounting prices at a given stage of fabrica-&#13;
tion by V, the value of imported input per unit of output by Nb and the&#13;
input requirement coefficient by ajiV the cost of a dollar earned or saved&#13;
(C i) can be written as:&#13;
j V; aji&#13;
ci = pb E Nb                                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(9&#13;
i- E N   aij&#13;
46.       For example, if the cost of domestic resources is 400 cruzeiros, the&#13;
commodity border price 25 dollars and the expenditure on imported inputs is&#13;
5 dollars, the domestic resource cost of a dollar in the i-th industry will&#13;
be 20 cruzeiros. If the accounting exchange rate is 18 cruzeiros to the dollar,&#13;
the industry can be considered noncompetitive, in that the cost of a dollar&#13;
earned through its operation exceeds the rate of substitution between domestic&#13;
currency and dollars (the accounting rate of exchange) by 11%.&#13;
47.       According to Bruno, the originator of the DRC measure, the cost of&#13;
foreign exchange criterion "clearly measures comparative advantage". At the&#13;
core of the criterion, however, lie two basic estimates of values: (i) the&#13;
accounting prices of domestic resources, and (ii) the accounting exchange rate&#13;
to be used to convert these prices in units of international currency. Because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
the DRC measures concern entire sectors of production rather than marginal&#13;
products, accounting values of resources and of foreign exchange are not&#13;
independent of the composition of production. For example, the accounting price&#13;
of unskilled rural labor in rice production may be defined as the value of&#13;
the production foregone in the next best alternative by a marginal unit of&#13;
labor employed in rice sector. Ideally, this value would be unique, since&#13;
marginal productivities of domestic resources of all sectors should be equalized&#13;
by competition in labor markets. In practice, however, marginal productivities&#13;
of labor, land and capital vary widely across sectors. They also obviously&#13;
depend on the relative size of each sector.&#13;
48.       For all policy changes of significant proportions, therefore, account-&#13;
ing prices of factors and shadow exchange rates should be calculated for&#13;
the situation existing before and after the suggested policy changes and the&#13;
corresponding two sets of DRC's considered to evaluate the policies. As in&#13;
similar index number problems, this two-fold evaluation would be conclusive&#13;
in some cases (where the DRC's before and after the change offer the same&#13;
qualitative assessment for an expansion or contraction of a given sector)&#13;
and inconclusive in others.&#13;
49.       From the practical point of view, the definition of the DRC suffers&#13;
also from the problem that it is not always clear what are domestic and&#13;
foreign resources. A more useful dichotomy to use is that between traded&#13;
and non-traded, because this dichotomy is important in the valuation of&#13;
inputs and outputs. This is used in the equations given below. Two formulae&#13;
were given to the researchers carrying out the six country case studies:&#13;
those given in ejuations (10) and (11) below. In equation (10) the value&#13;
of the numerator is expressed in domestic prices and the denominator in&#13;
foreign prices.&#13;

indirect, primary, non-traded elements of non-traded items left after decom-&#13;
position. When multiplied by the output it gatves the total value of the non-&#13;
traded, primary domestic resources used.&#13;
50.        Equation (10) gives us implicit foreign exchange rates for specific&#13;
activities, which can be compared directly with an accounting price of foreign&#13;
exchange. This price, however is not unique as it can be seen by considering&#13;
a second formula for the DRC based on a decomposition of nontraded goods into&#13;
their tradable components:&#13;
E   a.. * MPPY *P&#13;

Pi    £(a ij*     )&#13;
51.        The only difference between equations (10) and (11) is that in (11)&#13;
the prices of both the numerator and the denominator are border ones, whereas&#13;
in (10) the prices in the numerator are domestic and the prices in the de-&#13;
nominator are foreign. By comparing equations (11) and (10), however, we&#13;
can see that the accounting price of foreign exchange, to which the DRC in&#13;
(10) has to be compared, will be sector specific. Such a price is simply given&#13;
by P /P , the ratio of the unit domestic value to the unit border value of&#13;
the tunXle of goods that the resources employed in the ith sector would generate&#13;
in their alternative use.&#13;
52.        In both equations (10) and (11), MPPY is often difficult to estimate&#13;
in practicg, anddin sur, cases consultants were iadvised to replace MPPY multi-&#13;
plied by P   or P  by P.  or P'J, respectively, where P! is the estimated value&#13;

of the marginal product of the jth resource in its next best use, net of taxes&#13;
and subsidies. In the absence of adequate information about marginal value&#13;
products, it was realized that market prices of the factor (resources) would&#13;
have to be used as a surrogate. Additional complications in estimating the&#13;
numerator of (11) can be solved by the use of a conversion factor. For example,&#13;
if one of the goods is transportation, sixty percent of it can be considered&#13;
tradeable and priced accordingly by using a miscellaneous conversion factor&#13;
based on the border price of trucks and gasoline, while fourty percent can&#13;
be considered a nontradeable whose value is embedded in the wage payment to&#13;
the labor used.&#13;
53.        It,ahould be noted in equation (10) that, if the MPPY . P   is&#13;
replaced by Pj, and, if the resulting expansion is divided by tie acJounting&#13;
exchange rate, we have the Balassa formula used in his Western Africa Study. 1/&#13;
The Balassa formula gives a pure number: A DRC &lt;1 means that the domestic&#13;
production of the commodity would be economically unprofitable and vice versa.&#13;
54.        Equation (10) also gives us a pure number.   It gives us the border&#13;
price value of the resources (factors) in their (weighted) average alternative&#13;
use per unit of border priced value of the resources in their existing use.&#13;
If the number is greater than one, it tells us that the resources would be put&#13;
to better use in an alternative way, and, if less than one, that this    is a&#13;
relatively sound use of resources.&#13;
Net Economic Benefit&#13;
55.        Another way of looking at comparative advantage in terms of&#13;
economic efficiency is to appraise the existing use of resources in agriculture&#13;
using a simplified form of the L-M/S-T or the UNIDO methodologies. The use of&#13;
these methodologies in fact makes clear that the name "comparative advantage"&#13;
foreshadows at least two different questions. First, as we have indicated&#13;
before, one can ask whether the resources used in broad sectors or sub-sectors&#13;
of the economy could have been put to more profitable use elsewhere. Second,&#13;
we can ask whether it would be profitable to expand the production of a par-&#13;
ticular commodity (or a bundle of commodities) and to what extent it might be&#13;
desirable to do so. In practice this entails the appraisal of a specific&#13;
marginal investment whose ultimate effect is to increase the size of the sector&#13;
(i.e. both its resource use and its production).&#13;
1/ Balassa in fact used two formulae--one where the foreign prices were con-&#13;
verted into border rupees by applying the official exchange rate, and a&#13;
second where the "shadow" price of foreign exchange was used to convert&#13;
foreign prices to domestic rupees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
56.        Because the second question is likely to presuppose a positive answer to&#13;
first and because it really addresses the issue of project evaluation rather&#13;
than sector-wide comparative advantage, we concentrate here on the first&#13;
type of question. In this case it would be inappropriate and probably&#13;
impractical to consider the discounted value of a specific stream of benefits&#13;
when looking at the comparative advantages of broad sectors or sub-sectors&#13;
and evaluatin the comparative advantage of the existing stock of agricultural&#13;
investment. L-/ Rather, the situation is similar to what in project analysis&#13;
is referred to as "full development" net project benefits. In other words,&#13;
we consider the present make-up of a productive sector as the result of a&#13;
large number of past investment decisions and we ask whether now, at full&#13;
development of those many investment projects, total benefits exceed total&#13;
costs (including capital consumption allowances or as they are currently&#13;
referred to, depreciation). Equation (12) summarizes this approach:&#13;
i    i   j-l (ai              k+l (aij   MPP     p b       (12)&#13;
1/ Similarly, the converse applies: when analyzing the effects of a&#13;
marginal investment, additional to the capital stock, the differential&#13;
incidence of benefits and costs and the time values of money are important.&#13;
This may be one reason why the DRC has not been used in cost benefit analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

j=k+l ..j    = inputs of primary, non-traded factors--includes those&#13;
obtained as a result of the decomposition of non-traded&#13;
goods.&#13;
56. (cont.) It can be seen that the only difference between equations (12)&#13;
and (11) is that the different elements of each equation are differently&#13;
arranged, but this is not so for equation (10), where different units are&#13;
used in the numerator and denominator. While equations (12) and (11) are&#13;
formally identical, they could be different in practice because of the&#13;
arbitrariness involved in the tradeables versus non-tradables classification.&#13;
Going back to the example of transportation, depending on how much of&#13;
this "complex" input is considered tradeable or non-tradeable, the DRC    in&#13;
(11) may be greater or smaller than 1 and the conclusions on comparative&#13;
advantage mwv turn out to be quite different for different classifications.&#13;
No such ambi!quities arise from the use of the Bi measure.&#13;
Producer Subsidy Equivalent (PSE) and Consumer Subsidy Equivalent (CSE)&#13;
57.          Producer Subsidy Equivalents (PSE) and Consumer Subsidy Equiva-&#13;
lents (CSEs) were derived and first applied to agricultural products&#13;
(wheat, barley, maize, rice, sugar and dairy products) for some of the&#13;
developed countries (Australia, Canada, European Community (six), Japan&#13;
and the United Kingdom) where trade in the commodities is important.&#13;
The FAO study 1/ showed that over the period 1968 through 1974, which&#13;
included periods of both high and low prices, producers received consid-&#13;
erable net subsidies, while consumers received substantial negative sub-&#13;
sidies or paid substantial net taxes. 2/ Although not all the six country&#13;
1/ Josling, op. cit.&#13;
2/ In the period of relatively high prices, developed countries took&#13;
advantage of the rise to reduce the subsidies to producers and the&#13;
taxes on consumers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
case studies of the World Bank research project calculated PSE, and CSEs,&#13;
the general picture in LDCs is the reverse of the more developed countries:&#13;
PSEs are negative and CSEs are positive, i.e. producers are taxed and&#13;
consumers subsidized, and often the net taxes on producers and the net&#13;
subsidies to consumers are high. There are some indications, however, that&#13;
the world food shortage, together with the relative failure of industry-&#13;
led development strategies, have caused some LDCs to rethink their agricul-&#13;
tural pricing, tax and subsidy policies.&#13;
58.       The PSE is the subsidy, net of indirect taxes, given to producers,&#13;
expressed as a percentage of market value (price x quantity per annum) of&#13;
each commodity. In estimating the market value, care has to be exercised to&#13;
ensure that direct payments to producers are added onto the market value. The&#13;
CSE is the subsidy, net of indirect taxes, given to consumers, expressed as a&#13;
percentage of the total consumer value (volume of consumption x retail price).&#13;
Since PSEs and CSEs can fluctuate considerably with changing price levels it is&#13;
desirable to estimate them for a number of years to show trends and to graph the&#13;
results. Having done this, ideally, it would be desirable to update the&#13;
calculations yearly.&#13;
59.       PSEs and CSEs have the advantage that:    (a) they portray vividly and&#13;
simply the net effect of taxes and subsidies on producers and consumers of&#13;
agricultural products; (b) they can be estimated fairly simply from national&#13;
income and public sector accounts. On the other hand, they have to be inter-&#13;
preted with caution because: (i) they measure only the explicit subsidies and&#13;
indirect taxes; and (ii) like other partial equilibrium measures, they take no&#13;
account of "own-elasticities" and "cross-elasticities" of demand and supply.&#13;

V. EFFECTS OF PRICE DISTORTIONS: A MORE GENERAL&#13;
PARTIAL EQUILIBRIUM METHODOLOGY&#13;
60.       The methodology outlined in the previous section can be considered a&#13;
simplified form of a partial equilibrium methodology derived from the theory of&#13;
consumers' and producers' surplus. 1/ The latter was not employed in the&#13;
individual country case studies, but we have since applied it to the countries&#13;
concerned. 2/&#13;
61.       The basic analytic structure of the model is given by the follow-&#13;
ing formulae. (In the large country case, the border price would be the&#13;
marginal revenue converted into domestic currency units at the official exchange&#13;
rate.) The general formulae measure the gains/ losses/welfare transfers in&#13;
respect of producers, consumers, and governments for any kind of taxes and/or&#13;
subsidies on products. Here we use the net difference between border and&#13;
domestic prices since border prices are our reference points.&#13;

The loss in consumers' surplus is equal to the area PI P2AE.      The loss in&#13;
producers' surplus is equal to the area FP EG.     The tax (foreign exchange)&#13;
revenue is equal to the area FP 2AG. The net economic loss in consumption is,&#13;
therefore, equal to the area P 1P2AE - PP 2AC    = AEC.  The net economic loss&#13;
in production is equal to the area FP EG - FP CG = CEG.     AEC and CEG are the&#13;
famous Depuit Triangles. For consumers' surplus, if the demand curve is a&#13;
straight line within the relevant range, the area of the triangle AEC = 1/2&#13;
ABEC = 1/2(Q1 - Q2)(P2 - P1). In terms of the notation used in Equation (2)&#13;
above Q-Q2        (Cd -Cb) and P2 -P     = (Pb - Pd).   So we arrive at&#13;
Equation (B) NELc =1/2(Cd -Cb)(Pb -Pd).        But (Cd - cb)/Cd= -ndt    where&#13;
t  is the tax rate (Pb -     )/Pd.  Substituting  ndt    into (2) and multiply-&#13;
ing out we get NEL   = 1/2 t   n W, as in equation B.&#13;
c         c    d&#13;
63.        To obtain an alternative explanation of the same formulae, note that,&#13;
assuming that prices equal average costs (either because of long run technical&#13;
efficiency, input-output technology or as an approximation),the average increase&#13;
in cost of production following a tariff is (Pb       d  (Qd   Qb)-   The foreign&#13;
2d            b&#13;
exchange gained because of the same production increase, however, is only&#13;
Pb (Qd - Qb)- The net efficiency cost is then the difference between the two&#13;
terms which equals   NEL p- On the consumption side, we can make an analogous&#13;
computation by noting that the average fall in consumption value as a con-&#13;
sequence of the tariff is   b     d  (C  - C ) while the foreign exchange savings&#13;
2      b     d&#13;
amount to only Pb (Cb - Cd).    Again substracting one term from the other we obtain&#13;
the net efficiency loss in consumption NEL . As for welfare changes, producers&#13;
c&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
gain is given by additional foreign exchange earnings   Pb(Q d   Qb) plus increases&#13;
in revenue Q(Pd    P   minus the average increase in cost    (Pb    d   (Qd&#13;
2&#13;
or Qd(Pd - P b   NELp.   An analogous reasoning holds for consumers.&#13;
64.       The net welfare loss of a market distortion for a traded goods&#13;
thus depends on two main factors: (i) the trade (import demand or export&#13;
supply) elasticity and (ii) the net amount that would be traded without the&#13;
distortions. Because import demand and export supply elasticities are a&#13;
weighted average of supply and demand elasticities, with a negative weight&#13;
assigned to the demand elasticity, their value tends to be large even for&#13;
cases where the absolute value of demand and supply elasticities appear to&#13;
be low. As a consequence, if the amount exportable (importable) at world prices&#13;
is significant, the welfare loss from an export (import) tax may indeed grow&#13;
large.&#13;
65.       To give a further idea of the orders of magnitude involved, Table 1&#13;
presents value of the welfare loss from a 30% tax as a percentage of the value&#13;
exportable at world prices for a range of elasticity values and under the&#13;
conservative assumption that 30% of domestic production would be exported at&#13;
world prices.&#13;

The magnitudes indicated in Table 1 are expressed as a percentage of the&#13;
value of the commodity that the country would be able to export under free&#13;
trade. If this value is large, the cost of the export tax may be large&#13;
indeed. If the country accounts for a large market share of the commodity&#13;
in question, on the other hand, an export tax may raise world prices and&#13;
therefore be beneficial for the country. In both cases, however, transfers&#13;
of welfare would be high.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

66.       While one may conjecture that welfare costs of present agricul-&#13;
tural policies are substantial, clearly ad hoc analysis is needed to appraise&#13;
the efficiency losses of any particular case. Despite the limitation inherent&#13;
to any partial equilibrium model in respect of income distribution and effects&#13;
on other sectors of the economy, the elasticity framework has been found&#13;
useful in analyzing the impact of market interventions on prices, quantities,&#13;
government revenues and consumers and producers welfare. This is especially&#13;
true where (i) the good considered does not affect a large part of the&#13;
economy, and (ii) producers and consumers may be treated as separate classes&#13;
of economic agents.&#13;
67.       Some interesting expansions of partial equilibrium analysis concern&#13;
a number of factors that have traditionally been considered as falling out of&#13;
its domain. These are: (i) market failures (monopolies, increasing costs,&#13;
etc.); (ii) risk and uncertainty; (iii) multi-market effects and (iv) income&#13;
distribution. Measurement of the welfare impact of the distortions in these&#13;
special cases requires, in addition to demand and supply elasticities, quan-&#13;
titative information on the distortions that are the cause of market failure&#13;
(for example, the degree of monopoly power as expressed by the elasticity of&#13;
the demand curve facing the monopolist), on the sources of uncertainty and on&#13;
the income distribution mechanism. The modifications required to compute the&#13;
impact of the distortions under such different conditions are not great. In&#13;
general (See Appendix IV) they mainly consist of correcting the values of the&#13;
elasticities by appropriate factors reflecting the additional market char-&#13;
acteristics taken into account.&#13;
68.        In all cases, the basic parameters needed to evaluate the impact&#13;
of price interventions are the elasticities of supply and demand. These para-&#13;
meters quantify the responsiveness of producers and consumers to price move-&#13;
ments and provide the basis for a forecast of production and consumption&#13;
changes induced by the market intervention. Numerous studies have attempted&#13;
to make econometric estimates of demand and supply elasticities and a survey&#13;
of these attempts is contained in Appendices II and III. Tables 2 and 3&#13;
summarize some of the most recent restimates for a sample of developing coun-&#13;
tries.&#13;
69.       The evidence on agricultural supply elasticity is unfortunately both&#13;
biased and weak. Most of the successful attempts at estimating behavioral&#13;
supply functions concern acreage response equations. An indirect account of&#13;
the response of other factors such as capital and labor through yield response&#13;
functions has been tried much less successfully by econometricians. Production&#13;
function and more recently, profit function analysis has been used to account&#13;
directly for response in factor use and substitution. This analysis suggests&#13;
that supply elasticities may be very high in agriculture, since the response&#13;
to price increases is particularly strong in the non-land variables: labor,&#13;
fertilizer, pesticides, etc.&#13;
70.       While the evidence is diverse, most of the successful attempts&#13;
report estimates of acreage response in the range of 0.1 to 0.8 for short&#13;
run elasticities and 0.3 to 1.2 for the long run ones. 1/ Yield responses&#13;

tend to have lower ranges and reported estimates appear much less reliable&#13;
and numerous. While reported attempts may be biased, there seems to be little&#13;
doubt that: (i) farmers appear to respond to price signals, and (ii) their&#13;
response is conservative in the short run but tends to build up and to become&#13;
considerable if the price variation persists for a sufficiently long period&#13;
of time.&#13;
71.       The elasticities estimated through the production function approach&#13;
tend to be high, particularly if profit maximization assumptions are used with&#13;
functions showing only minor decreasing returns to scale. For the Cobb-Douglas&#13;
case, for example, output supply elasticity is equal to the ratio between the&#13;
coefficient of scale and its complement to one 1/ so that it tends to infinity&#13;
as returns to scale approach one. If a major factor of production such as,&#13;
for example, capital or land for small farmers are assumed to be given,&#13;
however, even with constant returns to scale supply elasticities would fall&#13;
to the level shown by direct acreage and yield estimates.&#13;
72.       On demand elasticities, the evidence, also diverse, points to a&#13;
range of values not very far, in absolute terms, from the estimated values of&#13;
supply elasticities. In general, basic food items (foodgrains, pulses,&#13;
staples, etc.) show own price elasticities in the range of 0.2 to 0.7; high&#13;
income items such as meat and fruits show higher elasticities often in excess&#13;
of 1, and special items such as coffee, cocoa and sugar show very low elasti-&#13;
cities.&#13;
73.       The low measurable values of supply and demand responses to price&#13;
changes tend to limit the damaging consequences of price distortions in agri-&#13;
culture. But despite these low values, the size of the present distortions&#13;
is such that, according to our estimates, a production shortfall in the range&#13;
of 10% to 50%, depending on the country, is likely to be the effect of the&#13;
present direct and indirect taxation policies in agriculture.&#13;
74.       Before reporting our own estimates, it is interesting to look at&#13;
some of the results of recent studies on economic losses due to distortions in&#13;
agriculture. Table 4 briefly reviews some studies reported in *the American&#13;
Journal of Agricultural Economics. For all studies, net economic losses appear&#13;
to be substantial, both in absolute and relative terms. Real effects and&#13;
foreign exchange losses not reported in Table 4 were also estimated to be&#13;
large. For example, Valdes (1973) in his study of the trade policy of Chile,&#13;
estimated negative effective rates of protection averaging: -.38 for wheat,&#13;
-.35 for beef, -.30 for lamb and, -.46 for wool. Because of these rates, he&#13;
found that production was below equilibrium levels from 3 to 10% for wheat, from&#13;
4.5 to 14.5% for beef, and from 6.8 to 23% for wool. The loss in foreign&#13;
exchange earnings ranged from 24 to 39 million dollars, depending on the supply&#13;
elasticities. Accordingly, Chile's agricultural trade deficit would have been&#13;
reduced by 76% during 1951-55 and would have pratically disappeared during&#13;
1956-60.&#13;
Eai&#13;
1/   The formula is n      i =     where ai is the elasticity of production&#13;
with respect to the i-th input and ni is supply elasticity under profit&#13;
maximization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
75.       We have investigated the effects of price distortions in agriculture&#13;
in two different ways: first, for a sample of countries for which detailed&#13;
studies of the tax and subsidy system were available, 1/ the partial equili-&#13;
brium methods illustrated above have been applied to evaluate the real and the&#13;
monetary effects of price intervention. Second, for a smaller sample of&#13;
countries, data provided by World Bank reports have been utilized to evaluate&#13;
more specifically the intervention policies on markets for foodgrains&#13;
(including food distribution programs).&#13;
76.       Tables 5 and 6 present the empirical estimates for the first sample.&#13;
These estimates are based on the elasticity ranges shown in Tables 2 and 3&#13;
and on the estimates of nominal protection coefficients provided by the&#13;
reference material. 2/ Because of the limitations of the data base, the esti-&#13;
mates in Tables 5 and 6 represent average annual value 1973-75 for Argentina,&#13;
Egypt, Portugal and Yugoslavia, average annual value 1974-75 for Thailand, and&#13;
annual values for Kenya and Pakistan. Data from FAO Production and Trade&#13;
yearbooks were used to compute production, consumption and trade figures.&#13;
Using as a reference the intervals of variation tabulated in Tables 3 and 4,&#13;
plausible elasticity ranges were used for supply and demand elasticities. In&#13;
most cases supply elasticities were assumed to range from 0 to 1/3 or 1/3 to&#13;
2/3 whereas demand elasticities were assumed from 0 to -1/3 and from -1/3 to&#13;
-2/3.&#13;
77.       In order to separate the effects of the currency overvaluation from&#13;
the one of the specific tariff, the nominal protection coefficients were also&#13;
adjusted by multiplying them by the following Bank estimated conversion factors:&#13;
Argentina .8, Egypt .69, Kenya .76, Pakistan .91, Portugal .83, Thailand .88&#13;
and Yugoslavia .98. These adjusted estimates compare the effect of protection&#13;
on the individual crop in a second best situation, and permit measure of the&#13;
costs of market intervention whose removal is contemplated only for one speci-&#13;
fic sector. These estimates are presented in Table 7 and 8.&#13;
78.       The real effects of the price distortions (Tables 5 and 7) are often&#13;
sizable. Since production and consumption effects have opposite signs they&#13;
are additive with respect to trade effects. Where no government subsidies are&#13;
involved, price distortions cause a reduction in trade; on the other hand,&#13;
export or import subsidies cause an expansion of trade amounting to the sum of&#13;
the absolute production and consumption adjustments. For Pakistan, for&#13;
example, under the hypothesis of high demand and supply elasticities, the&#13;
negative protection for wheat resulted in a reduced production of 1,599&#13;
thousand metric tons and increased consumption by 940 thousand metric tons.&#13;
Thus, as compared to no price intervention, imports increased by 2,539 thousand&#13;
metric tons. Since, in actuality, total imports amounted to 1,345 thousand&#13;
metric tons, a removal of the import subsidies would have caused Pakistan to&#13;
become a wheat exporter.&#13;
79.       In Tables 6 and 8, the monetary effects of price distortions are&#13;
presented. The net economic losses in production and consumption depend cri-&#13;
tically on the extent of protection and on the elasticities. In some cases,&#13;

the net economic losses in production and consumption exceed 10% of the value&#13;
of production or consumption, using the high elasticity assumption. While&#13;
elasticities are important for the determination of the social losses, their&#13;
impact on the welfare gains of producers and consumers is small. Thus, a&#13;
doubling of an elasticity e.g., from 1/3 to 2/3 seldom changes the amount of&#13;
the transfer by more than 10%.&#13;
80.       The welfare transfers are in all cases much larger than the res-&#13;
pective welfare losses. In one third of the cases, the welfare gain (or loss)&#13;
of producers is more than 10 times as large as the net economic loss in pro-&#13;
duction using the high elasticity assumption. Since positive protection&#13;
exists for only three out of the 24 cases, the producers incur welfare losses&#13;
in 21 cases. Even though not all major commodities were taken into consider-&#13;
ation, this is indicative of how heavily penalized agriculture is in developing&#13;
countries. The sum of the welfare losses for producers are substantial even&#13;
in per capita terms. Analogously, consumers make substantial welfare gains in&#13;
21 out of 24 cases.&#13;
81.       All calculations imply a small country assumption.   This was con-&#13;
sidered to be justified since the world market shares of the countries and&#13;
commodities in question are small. A case could be made for using the large&#13;
country assumption for cotton exports from Egypt because of the distinguish-&#13;
able characteristics of long staple cotton. This however, would have no&#13;
effects on any of our estimates except on the government revenue which would&#13;
be increased by an amount of exports times the world market price increase of&#13;
cotton due to the reduction of exports.&#13;
82.       There are several limitations of the above analysis.    First, the&#13;
period of analysis is between 1973 and 1975, at a time when world market&#13;
prices for some commodities were high in comparison with the long-run average.&#13;
This tends to overestimate gains and losses for commodities with negative&#13;
rates of protection and tends to underestimate gains and losses where positive&#13;
protection exists. Second, the assumptions on the ranges of the elasticities&#13;
result in corresponding ranges for the estimates of efficiency losses and not&#13;
in specific estimates which might be desirable. Third, no distinction was&#13;
made between prices facing producers and consumers. Fourth, the effects on&#13;
factor prices and employment are not estimated.&#13;
83.       The impact of policies designed to extend the distribution of key&#13;
foodgrains has been investigated in five Asian countries: Bangladesh, India,&#13;
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Indonesia over a three year period beginning in 1974.&#13;
A large percentage of the population in all five countries would have clearly&#13;
suffered from malnutrition if domestic prices were as high as the world price&#13;
which prevailed from 1974-75. Even at the relatively reasonable world price&#13;
levels of 1976-77, a sizable number in all five countries could not have&#13;
afforded to buy adequate quantities of foodgrains. During this period&#13;
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan all operated ration shops that made low quality&#13;
foodgrains available at relatively constant and low prices to coupon holders&#13;
(in the case of Bangladesh and India), or to the entire population, while in&#13;
Indonesia, although rationing did not exist, domestic market prices were kept&#13;
from reaching the high world levels in 1974 and 1975 by the official release&#13;
of subsidized imports and stocks.&#13;

84.       The analytical framework used to evaluate the foodgrain policies is&#13;
the same partial equilibrium model described in para. 75 above. In the case&#13;
of food policies, however, it is not satisfactory to evaluate costs and&#13;
benefits through real increases in aggregate consumption and production and/or&#13;
through consumers' and producers' surplus estimates. While the government&#13;
objective may be broad and include the need to assure a minimum subsistence&#13;
level to the poor, avoid excessive wage increases in the urban areas, etc., a&#13;
suitable index of cost effectiveness may be provided by a nutrition based&#13;
concept of food needs. This is defined as the total amount of foodgrains that&#13;
would have to be distributed through the domestic market and rationing systems&#13;
in order to guarantee that the population below the FAO-WHO calorie requirement&#13;
be adequately nourished.&#13;
85.       Based on the above definition, Tables 9 and 10 show the real con-&#13;
sumption effects of the lower average price faced by consumers as a conse-&#13;
quence of government policies. 1/ As Table 11 shows, government intervention&#13;
never closes more than 56% of the potential nutrition gap. In both Sri Lanka&#13;
and Pakistan the commitment to external foodgrain availability appears rela-&#13;
tively constant due undoubtedly to the policy of the distribution of substan-&#13;
tial quantities at low ration prices. Bangladesh appears to be increasing its&#13;
commitment as it adjusts to its independent state. In India, the commitment,&#13;
although substantial, seems designed more to respond to crisis situations than&#13;
everyday needs; while in Indonesia, extended foodgrain distribution seems to&#13;
occur only during periods of high world prices and may even be partially&#13;
financed by reduced distribution in periods of low world prices.&#13;
86.       The above definition of "real" effects of foodgrain policies permits&#13;
measuring costs effectiveness of government intervention in terms of allev-&#13;
iation of malnutrition. Table 11 shows how the costs of the distribution&#13;
policies are borne partly by producers (through the loss in producers' surplus&#13;
due to procurement prices lower than world prices) and partly by the government&#13;
and reports measures of costs effectiveness as the ratio between the increase&#13;
in consumption of the malnourished (i.e., the people consuming below the&#13;
FAO-WHO requirement) and total cost (col. 5) or between the same increase and&#13;
fiscal cost (col. 6).&#13;
87.       The results reported show that with the exception of Sri Lanka,&#13;
where the beneficiary of the rationing policy is the population at large&#13;
rather than any specific target group, the loss of producers' surplus per unit&#13;
of additional consumption of the malnourished is equal to or greater than the&#13;
corresponding fiscal cost. In all cases the sheer magnitude of the two losses&#13;
imply that the food procurement and distribution policies are costly and&#13;
inefficient both because of (i) high production losses and (ii) because of&#13;
leakages of benefits from the low food prices to unintended beneficiaries.&#13;
88.       To sum up:   the partial equilibrium analysis of market intervention&#13;
policies in agriculture has been illustrated by the use of the consumers' -&#13;
producers' surplus framework for several developing countries. For the case&#13;

where nutritional targets may be of concern, an extension of the same framework&#13;
to evaluate cost effectiveness of government policies has also been shown for&#13;
a smaller sample of countries. In all cases presented intervention policies&#13;
tend to put a heavy burden on the economy of the country and a heavier and&#13;
direct one on its agricultural producers.&#13;

VI.  EVALUATION OF METHODOLOGIES&#13;
89.       From a general point of view, it can be shown (see Appendix I) that&#13;
DRCs, NPCs and EPCs are all in their different ways measures of product-specific&#13;
accounting exchange rates. Specifically, the DRC for the ith product equals the&#13;
marginal rate of transformation between domestic and foreign currency in the&#13;
production of the i-th good (Appendix I, p. 62); the NPC equals the marginal&#13;
rate of substitution between domestic and foreign currency when a foreign&#13;
exchange increase is turned into extra consumption of the same good (Appendix I,&#13;
p. 61); and the EPC is an appropriate weighted average of DRCs and NPCs (Appendix I.&#13;
p. 64).&#13;
90.       As Bruno has shown 1/, the DRC is a special way of looking at the&#13;
NEB coefficient. Using the NEB, one gets an absolute value figure--positive&#13;
or negative. One can also pick up one primary factor, say capital, estimate&#13;
an internal rate of return to that factor and then compare it to the accounting&#13;
price of capital. What is done in the DRC is to "pick up the input and output&#13;
of foreign exchange (in the case of an export or an import substitute) and&#13;
compare a corresponding ratio of domestic resource costs (domestic, non-traded,&#13;
primary inputs) per unit of net foreign exchange output with the accounting&#13;
exchange rate." 2/ (Square brackets added.)&#13;
91.       Data problems make it difficult to estimate accurately DRCs and EPCs&#13;
and they can vary substantially and quickly with changes in world priees, but&#13;
NPCs, EPCs and DRCs can be used quite confidently for a qualitative assessment&#13;
of comparative advantage and the distortionary effects of trade policies. But&#13;
it takes time to estimate a set of EPCs and DRCs for all the more important&#13;
agricultural products.   Fortunately, on the basis of the six country case&#13;
studies, it would seem that the EPCs do not differ significantly from the NPCs&#13;
for agricultural products.   This is basically because purchased inputs are a&#13;
relatively small proportion of the value of outputs of most agricultural crops&#13;
c6mrpVed to many manufactured products.   For similar_reasons_ESCs do not&#13;
differ significantly from EPCs.   Although producer input subsidies are often&#13;
large in terms of budgetary resources, relative to the value of output and the&#13;
taxes on output they are small.   It follows that, unless purchased inputs are&#13;
a high proportion of output, which is unlikely in most developing countries,&#13;
calculating NPCs for the more important agricultural products is probably a&#13;
sufficiently accurate measure of the degree of distortion and disincentive--at&#13;
least for an initial or quick review of any situation--caused by a country's&#13;
trade policies.&#13;
92.       Although it is partly a question of taste and familiarity, we prefer&#13;
the NEB measure for the following three reasons: first, one does not have to&#13;
worry about which element goes on the top and which on the bottom of a co-&#13;
1/   "Domestic Resource Costs and Effective Protection:   Clarification and&#13;
Synthesis," Michael Bruno, Journal of Political Economy, #80 (1972).&#13;
2/   Ibid., p. 20.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
efficient as in the DRC one; 1/ second, all values are expressed in the same&#13;
unit of account or numeraire; and third, this is the formulation, albeit&#13;
without the collapsing of the time profile, which the World Bank has adopted in&#13;
respect to its project planning work. Nevertheless, we recognize that others&#13;
may prefer the DRC to the NEB, and, provided the estimation of the national&#13;
parameters and project-specific opportunity costs are the same, the two&#13;
measures will give the same answers. Whichever measure is used, estimating a&#13;
set of national parameters--accounting prices and national conversion factors&#13;
--would make the task of estimating a set of NEBs or a set of DRCs from time&#13;
to time, much easier. Thus, the requirements for sound policy analysis and&#13;
good project cost benefit analysis coincide.&#13;
93.       Calculation of PSEs and CSEs not only supplements the information&#13;
obtained from calculating NPCs and NEBs, but provides some very broad inform-&#13;
ation about the income distribution effects of market interventions, i.e.,&#13;
between producer and consumer, and, if calculated also for a range of manu-&#13;
factured products, would provide an indirect comparison of the net effects as&#13;
between agriculture and manufacturing industry. The PSEs and CSEs would have&#13;
to be broken down by income groups to obtain a fuller picture of the income&#13;
distribution effects. To do this accurately would be difficult and involve&#13;
sample surveys being undertaken. Almost certainly such surveys would confirm&#13;
the impressions one gets from examining the structure of the agricultural and&#13;
industrial sectors and odd pieces of information--namely, that the explicit&#13;
and implicit taxes on agriculture bear most heavily on those least able to&#13;
bear them, that producer subsidies tend to go to the richer farmers rather&#13;
than the poorer farmers and consumer subsidies often go to people who do not&#13;
need them. In short, that the net effect of tax-subsidies is typically&#13;
regressive.&#13;
94.       The use of PSEs and CSEs is a simplified, special case of the wider,&#13;
more detailed, partial equilibrium model for estimating the allocation in-&#13;
efficiencies and welfare transfers as between consumers, producers and govern-&#13;
ments, outlined in Section VI. The results are an interesting application of&#13;
applied welfare economics. However, the data requirements for applying the&#13;
model to any real world situation are both larger and subject to a higher&#13;
degree of error (particularly the demand and supply elasticities) than using&#13;
the simpler Joslin Methodology. If time, resources and data permit, the more&#13;
comprehensive methodology should be used, but if time, resources, and data are&#13;
a serious constraint, the Joslin Methodology gives an insight into rough&#13;
orders of magnitude of the allocative inefficiencies and welfare transfers&#13;
involved in any system of agricultural administered prices, taxes and&#13;
subsidies.&#13;
1/ E.g., capital has to be divided between traded and non-traded inputs&#13;
with corresponding allocations to the numerator and denominator of the&#13;
DRC equation. See Bruno, op.cit., p. 27, and Corden, W.M., "The Structure&#13;
of Tariff Systems and the Effective Protection Rate", J.P.E. #74, June&#13;
1966, p. 232.&#13;

95.       To conclude, it has been shown that the summary measures, partic-&#13;
-ularly the NPCs and the NEBs/DRCs, are useful in illustrating the general&#13;
economic efficiency effects of agricultural administered prices, taxes and&#13;
subsidies. To a lesser extent, the PSEs and the CSEs, particularly if supple-&#13;
mented with other distributional data, illustrate some income distribution&#13;
effects of the same prices, taxes and subsidies.&#13;

VII. GUIDELINES FOR ANALYZING PRICE INTERVENTION EFFECTS&#13;
96.       An analysis of a large sample of World Bank Country Economic Reports&#13;
and Agricultural Sector Reports revealed that the analyses of the effects of&#13;
administered agricultural prices, taxes and subsidies was unsatisfactory in&#13;
many respects. 1/ The practical question is whether country economic work and&#13;
agricultural sector work can be improved significantly without a deterioration&#13;
in other aspects of this kind of work which might be equally or more important,&#13;
since a trade-off is clearly involved.&#13;
97.       It is largely a question of judgment whether there would be a net&#13;
benefit from substituting some analysis of the effects of administered agri-&#13;
cultural prices, taxes and subsidies on economic efficiency and income distri-&#13;
ution in place of other analysis and other country and agricultural sector&#13;
work. We believe rather strongly that the substitution or application of&#13;
additional resources to such analysis on a systematic basis would reap handsome&#13;
dividends, from the point of view of LDCs and aid agencies. We believe this&#13;
for the following reasons:&#13;
(a) The case studies reveal that the distortions are substantial in&#13;
many LDCs: the domestic terms of trade have been turned heavily&#13;
against agriculture vis-a-vis the rest of the economy; cropping&#13;
patterns have been distorted against what long-run comparative&#13;
cost advantage would indicate is the optimum pattern; income&#13;
distribution has been made worse; and policies are internally&#13;
inconsistent and not achieving what it was believed they would&#13;
do. Thus, growth rates in agriculture and hence the economy as&#13;
a whole are lower than they could be, and the poor bear a dis-&#13;
proportionately heavy burden of the consequences; and the balance&#13;
of payments has been made worse.&#13;
(b) Nowhere are the above consequences more important than for food&#13;
production. Self-sufficiency in food in a world of growing food&#13;
shortages is a political not an economic criterion. Nevertheless&#13;
comparative cost advantages are such in the major food deficit&#13;
countries, that substantial increases in the output of subsistence&#13;
and marketable food crops could be effected if farmers were given&#13;
adequate incentives in terms of removing many of the existing price/&#13;
tax/subsidy distortions, particularly if, at the same time, input&#13;
delivery systems were improved and made available to the poorer&#13;
farmers.&#13;
(c) Some of the more important constraints on effective project&#13;
formulation and implementation which one comes across so often have&#13;
to do with inappropriate agricultural pricing, taxation and subsidy&#13;
policies. It is generally unrealistic to expect that leverage to&#13;
remove the constraints can be applied with success through indi-&#13;
vidual projects--a sector-wide or, indeed, economy-wide dialogue&#13;
needs to be entered into in order to effect an improvement in&#13;
1/   See Brown and Donaldson, op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
policies. It is difficult to enter into such dialogues without a&#13;
study of the policy effects and this may be possible only when&#13;
additional information has been collected. Thus, an analysis of&#13;
pricing effects on a sectoral/national basis is important both to&#13;
improve economic performance generally and to remove constraints&#13;
in respect to designing and implementing sound projects. In turn,&#13;
analysis of pricing effects is made simpler if a set of national&#13;
parameters (accounting prices and conversion factors) is available&#13;
for each country.&#13;
98.       Preferably the analysis and the back-up national parameters should&#13;
be estimated by each country and reviewed periodically, but whether this is&#13;
done by LDCs themselves (by the national planning agencies and/or the min-&#13;
istries of agriculture) or by or with the assistance of external aid agencies,&#13;
the trade-off problem can to a large extent be avoided by employing consultants&#13;
to do the initial work and to train nationals to undertake periodic reviews&#13;
and revisions.&#13;
99.       Whoever does the work, how does one set about doing it?    Are there&#13;
any short-cuts that can be employed? It is suggested that a three-stage&#13;
exercise be undertaken. The first stage would consist of fact-finding and&#13;
description, including such things as ascertaining and describing all the&#13;
administered agricultural prices, direct and indirect taxes and subsidies and&#13;
physical controls on agriculture there are; undertaking a literature review;&#13;
summarising any previous studies; and obtaining realistic cost of production&#13;
profiles of the main agricultural products.&#13;
100.      The second stage would consist of estimating the key parameters such&#13;
as a set of accounting prices and conversion factors, elasticities and cross&#13;
elasticities of demand and supply for the main agricultural products, or&#13;
reviewing existing sets of key parameters and doing any necessary updating.&#13;
This is probably the most time-consuming stage in most LDCs and the one which&#13;
could well be carried out by consultants. For example, a foreign consultant,&#13;
working with a local civil servant in the Economic Planning Unit, Prime&#13;
Minister's Department, estimated a set of national parameters for project&#13;
appraisal in Malaysia at a cost of under US$20,000 (1977).&#13;
101.      The third and final stage would consist of the calculation of the&#13;
summary measures of distortion and disincentives, analysis and formulation of&#13;
conclusions and recommendations. In respect of the summary measures, NPCs can&#13;
be easily calculated for almost all countries 1/ because, even if border and&#13;
domestic prices cannot be compared directly, the NPC can be calculated by&#13;
using the foreign trade taxes and any discriminating indirect sales taxes&#13;
there may be and applying them either to the border price or to the domestic&#13;
price. If cost profiles for the major agricultural products are available for&#13;
a reasonable range of technologies--irrigated and rainfed, estate, settlement&#13;
and smallholders, etc.--then the national parameters can be used to estimate&#13;
1/   The retention coefficients mentioned in the Prologue are similar to NPCs&#13;
except they were estimated at the farmgate, and the farmgate financial&#13;
and border prices were estimated ones taken from World Bank Staff&#13;
Appraisal Reports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
NEBs. Alternatively, one can look at any recent appraisal reports (including&#13;
World Bank Staff Appraisal Reports) for the commodities in question and rework&#13;
the figures, applying the national parameters to come up with net present&#13;
values at market and at accounting prices.&#13;
102.      In most developing countries it should be possible to come up with&#13;
some rough and ready calculations of PSEs and CSEs, which will give additional&#13;
information of the burden of taxation on farmers and the extent to which they&#13;
are directly subsidising consumers. Subsidies for agricultural products&#13;
should also be expressed as a percentage of total government revenue and of&#13;
the national income/expenditure.&#13;
103.      None of the summary measures described above throw any detailed&#13;
light on the income distribution effects of administered taxes and subsidies,&#13;
and it may be desirable to add a further stage and try and trace through the&#13;
income distribution efforts with further studies, including sample surveys.&#13;
104.       Once all these measures are calculated, the next step is to&#13;
utilize them in policy analysis, planning and operational work. If NEB's&#13;
or DRC's are available, they should be used first to judge the optimality&#13;
of the present allocation of resources. Large NEB's (or DRC's much in excess&#13;
of 1) would indicate sectors where the best project opportunities may arise&#13;
and where the Government and the Bank should concentrate resources and project&#13;
identification activities. At the same time, however, large NEB's may&#13;
indicate the existence of extraneous factors hampering the expansion of the&#13;
sector and the full exploitation of its comparative advantage. Major&#13;
hampering factors are likely to be, as shown by the studies, all the various&#13;
combinations of market interventions reflected in the NPCs, EPCs, PSEs and CSEs.&#13;
105.       A second step to use these measures operationally, therefore,&#13;
should involve a comparison of the equivalent taxes and subsidies with the&#13;
conclusions on comparative advantage reached after the computation of the&#13;
NEB's. The basic question to be asked at this stage would be: is the&#13;
present system of interventions an obstacle to the expansion of the sectors&#13;
where comparative advantage lies? Clearly, implicit or explicit taxes&#13;
levied on producers or on consumers are a disincentive to production and&#13;
may entail a direct cost to development because they may discourage the&#13;
expansion of promising sectors (or they may encourage the expansion of un-&#13;
profitable ones).l/&#13;
1/ Note, however, that in practice it is often necessary to analyze the&#13;
optimality of taxes or subsidies on specific commodities, without regard&#13;
to the comparative advantage question. Such an analysis can be conveniently&#13;
carried out in terms of the producer/consumer surplus technique described&#13;
in Section V.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
106.      Whether an elimination or a reduction of these interventions should&#13;
be recommended, however, depends on a third step, which will consist of the&#13;
evaluation of the effects of the measures on several policy goals. Four&#13;
important sets of these effects have been illustrated in Section V of this&#13;
paper. They are consumers and producers surpluses, foreign exchange, govern-&#13;
ment revenues and food consumption of the poor. Two additional effects that&#13;
it may be important to evaluate are the employment implications of the market&#13;
interventions and the impact on selected population groups or regions. The&#13;
quantification of these effects will provide the main information for rec-&#13;
ommending a new level of taxes or subsidies, the elimination of the previous&#13;
ones or alternative sets of policies.&#13;
107.       Rather than considering a sweeping elimination of all market&#13;
interventions, it may be often useful to evaluate a partial elimination of&#13;
the existing taxes and subsidies. Given the surplus measures and the addi-&#13;
tional effects, one can compute the benefits and the costs of decreasing&#13;
say, a production tax from 10 percent to five percent. The benefits would&#13;
be the avoidance of producers' surplus losses, while the costs may be a&#13;
fall in government revenue and an increase in malnutrition. If one can&#13;
attach a value to these two effects, not only any given policy can be evaluated,&#13;
but also an optimum change can be determined.&#13;
108.       While it is advisable to avoid basing one's recommendations on&#13;
overly inflexible general principles, we would like to mention in closing&#13;
three general propositions put forward by economic theory that can also be&#13;
useful to guide policy analysis and/or policy prescriptions in this area.l/&#13;
First, the system of accounting prices that we have described in the past&#13;
pages is, as a rule, associated with a social optimum.    As a consequence,&#13;
the prima facie case against all taxes and subsidies is that they are in&#13;
principle undesirable.    Second, this conclusion holds both in a first best&#13;
situation where everything is optimal as well as in a situation where some&#13;
taxes are exogenously fixed and cannot be changed.   Third, while it may be&#13;
justified in some cases to raise taxes or pay subsidies to the private&#13;
sector to modify its behavior, this should be done without affecting public&#13;
sector efficiency.&#13;
109.       These propositions are intuitively appealing and have the gift&#13;
of simplicity in that they simply recommend sticking to the basic system&#13;
of accounting prices as the optimal set of mharket signals to enforce. While&#13;
a more deta.led consideration of the extent , the benefit and the costs of&#13;
market intervention is generally in order, this hard and fast rule is a&#13;
convenient point of departure for any pricing analysis. Once the analysis&#13;
is performed it may also provide a long term goal for the pricing policies&#13;
of the country.&#13;

Appendix I&#13;
A MATHEMATIC MODEL OF ACCOUNTING PRICES&#13;
1. The General Pricing Problem&#13;
1.        Pricing guidelines for the evaluation of market intervention&#13;
policies and, as a special case, for project evaluation, can be generated&#13;
through a mathematical model. Here we consider a simple static version of&#13;
such a model: additional complications such as many time periods, extern-&#13;
alities, etc. could easily be introduced and would result only in compli-&#13;
cating the algebra, not in modifying the substance of the results.&#13;
2.        Consider a country, whose system of national preferences can be&#13;
described by a function of the quantities consumed of each good:&#13;
U =   U (cl, c2 ... c '~'I+l ... cn)                               (1)&#13;
where U is an utility indicator for the country, cl, ... cn    are quantities&#13;
consumed of traded commodities, and cn    ... cn are consumptions of non-&#13;
traded commodities. Each good (traded and non-traded) can be produced&#13;
through a technology described by a neoclassical production function:&#13;
Xi= fi (yli)(i ........ y   I) YMi) +1  *- m).......... YM        (2)&#13;
i=1    ...n&#13;
where xi is the quantity domestically produced of good i, y1, y     are&#13;
quantities employed of imported factors, and Ym +1    X     Ym     are&#13;
quantities employed of domestic (non-traded) resources subject to the&#13;
constraint:&#13;
ziYk = Yk !!-Yk           k = Ek+l1, ...+  m                              (3)&#13;
where Yk,  k = ml + 1,   .. , m represent domestic availability of the&#13;
k-th untraded factor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
3.        Consumption and production levels of traded commodities and other&#13;
foreign exchange earnings (Y*) are linked together by the balance of&#13;
payment (B.O.P.) constraint:&#13;
ni                  m&#13;
E  P* (c  - x,) +   E w*   y  - y*  =  O                            (4)&#13;
i=l i'              j=l  ] &#13;
where Pi is international price of good i (assumed as given in a "small&#13;
I&#13;
country" framework) , and wJ is the international price of imported factor j.&#13;
J&#13;
4.        The problem of finding an optimal set of product and factor prices&#13;
can now be directly cast in terms of the utility maximization problem in&#13;
.(1) subject to (i) the BOP constraint in (4), (ii) the resource avail-&#13;
ability constraint in (3) and, (iii) a market clearing constraint for&#13;
untraded goods. Formally:&#13;
Max.   U=U(cl , ... cn)&#13;
nl                   ml&#13;
Subject to:    E  Pi (Cc  - x)+           y    Y*  = i&#13;
=  i   i    i      =1JJ&#13;
n   (il                    1                                     (5&#13;
E   k ) Y     0      ,k  =   ml   +   1  ,  ................m   (5)&#13;
ce   Xe &lt;  0      ,e = n+l,         n&#13;
e  e-1 &#13;
Xi - fi (y(i).. Ym ~)3 e   i = 1, ... n&#13;
All quantities non negative.&#13;
5.        The constrained maximization problem in (5) captures the main features&#13;
of the problem of price setting and the conditions for its solution can be&#13;
directly interpreted as pricing rules for all endogenous variables:&#13;
consumption and production levels, imports and exports, factor employment&#13;
etc. Forming the Lagrangean from (5), we can write the equivalent formulation:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
Max   L =U ( c,.    cn) - i[~p          ~-f (y*.       Y my.-Y* &#13;
1      n)      [i=    i   1C   fiiY       m3     j=l wjy &#13;
nl    m              -      n(e)                        (e)(6&#13;
i-lk~m+ kk        k    k    en +1    e Ice - fe(Y I.. Ym&#13;
6.         The Kuhn-Tucker conditions for the maximization of (6) imply          -tht&#13;
each non-zero consumption and factor employment level respect the following&#13;
equalities:&#13;
(7)&#13;
3L  =   auc   -   Tr  =   O  e  = nl+ , .................  n              (8)&#13;
-L   = 'p(      p*     + w*      )    _        e  = 0, j=1,2 ... nil              (9)&#13;
ay                              e~~~~~~~~~~~y&#13;
i            e=n1+1       yj&#13;
aL     nI        af.             n          a&#13;
~            ~           Wk+ P        r=            0,  k=mi+l    ... m       (10)&#13;
9yk         i=l    ayk       k   e =n+l    e   yk a&#13;
7.         Equations (7) - (10) can be directly interpreted as pricing rules&#13;
necessary to ensure maximization of (6).       These pricing rules are expressed,&#13;
however, in terms of "utils" or units used in the specification of the&#13;
utility functions. In order to translate them in monetary terms note&#13;
that p, the Lagrange multiplier of the BOP constraint can be interpreted&#13;
as the marginal utility of the foreign exchange in the hands of the&#13;
government(Y*). Thus, if we use Y* as a numeraire, expression (7) can be&#13;
rewritten as:&#13;
au/aci   =  aU/aei   =   ay*  =   P(11&#13;
V         au/ay*       ac .&#13;
________          ____ 1I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
which states that the marginal rate of substitution between foreign currency&#13;
and a traded good equals the utility value of an additional unit of con-&#13;
sumption (the "first best" price) and this in turn equals the good's border&#13;
price.&#13;
8.        Expression (8) can be treated in a similar way, dividing both&#13;
members by p:&#13;
aUIace           = =e        ;_ e.=nl+l,  ... n                    (12)&#13;
3U/Dy*     a ce      au aY&#13;
Because the we 's are the marginal utilities of the market clearing&#13;
constraints, they also equal, for all non-zero domestic commodities, the&#13;
vector of undistorted market prices (p) expressed in domestic currency,&#13;
multiplied by domestic currency (Y) marginal utility. Thus (12) can be&#13;
written as&#13;
DY;                   e=n     ... n                                (13)&#13;
e&#13;
where ca =   au/Y        ay*                                               (14)&#13;
9.        Equations (13) and (14) state another well-known rule of project&#13;
evaluation: prices of non-traded commodities in terms of the foreign excnange&#13;
numeraire equal undistorted domestic prices multiplied by a factor reflecting&#13;
the rate of exchange (the marRinal rate of substitution).between foreign and&#13;
domestic currency. If no distortions are present this factor is a f&#13;
constant depending on the units selected to measure domestic or foreign&#13;
currency. Thus, it can be conveniently set to equal the official exchange&#13;
rate. If trade or domestic distortions are present, however, the conversion&#13;
factor will be a function of these distortions and special assumptions are&#13;
needed, as we will see, to compute it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
10.        Performing similar normalizations on equations (9) and (10) yields the&#13;
pricing rules for non-zero and fully employed factors. For non-zero imported&#13;
factors, expression (9) can be written as follows:&#13;
DU/ay      ay*nf n afi                                 n        afe   ae)&#13;
u/ay*    =y= i=l                  i  a(g)   ayj      e=n +1  e a(;)    yi(&#13;
i=l  ~    J1 &#13;
j = 1, 2 ... m1&#13;
where      denotes the amount of factor y. used in the production of good i.&#13;
11.        This result states that optimum domestic price of input j should equal&#13;
a weighted average of its marginal productivity in all alternative uses&#13;
and this in turn should equal its import price. The weights should equal&#13;
the marginal shares of each Rood in the use of the input.         For ex-&#13;
pression (10) an analogous result can be written noting that for fully&#13;
employed factors in equilibrium     Dk = -Y wk   where wk is the domestic price&#13;
of the k-th factor.&#13;
Thus:                       f       if&#13;
nu          i    Yk       n            e      k6&#13;
W* = awk =* i     Pi   a(i   aY          e+  Pe   a()    ay                      aL6)&#13;
k    k            i   3~i)  'yk     e=n +1 ke&#13;
i=l      ~k              1         3k&#13;
12.        The rules implicitly dictated by the conditions for the maximization&#13;
of our simple model are thus clear and bear direct implications for pricing&#13;
policies and project evaluation criteria. As general guidelines they&#13;
can be stated as follows:&#13;
(1) For traded goods, (goods that are actively traded or&#13;
could be traded on the international markets) domestic prices should&#13;
equal international prices (Equation (11)).&#13;
(2) For non-traded goods, domestic prices should equal competitive&#13;
market clearing prices (Equation (13)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57-&#13;
(3) For traded inputs, import prices should equal domestic prices and&#13;
these in turn should equal a weighted average of the value of the&#13;
marginal productivities of traded and non-traded goods in whose&#13;
production the inputs are used. These values should be measured&#13;
as in (15) and expressed in the units of common numeraire.&#13;
(4) For non-traded inputs domestic prices should equal a weighted average&#13;
of marginal productivity values measured as in (16).&#13;
13.       These rules are simple, but far reaching.   With trivial modifications&#13;
of the analytical framework they can be extended to the case of intermediate&#13;
goods, large countries and intertemporal equilibria.&#13;
2.  The Second Best Case:   The General Conversion Factor and the Shadow Exchange Rate&#13;
14.       The simple rules specified above can be convenientlv modified to account&#13;
for specific government actions, institutional constraints, or other dis-&#13;
tortions causing domestic markets to fail to properly allocate resources.&#13;
15.       In order to analyze this "second best" case, assume that the s-th&#13;
consumer solves the problem:&#13;
Max Us(c   s I c2s  ' cms)                                      (17)&#13;
Subject to:          P    C  - y   &lt;    ;   s = 1,2 .....S&#13;
i=l      i   is    5 &#13;
where U is his utility function, pi is the domestic market price of the i-th&#13;
good, cis the quantity of the same good consumed. and Ys his income. The&#13;
necessary condition to solve (17) is thus:&#13;
5        5&#13;
au,     au   p&#13;
a cis    Y-!   i   0   il= 1,2...n                                 (18)&#13;
s= 1,2 ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-&#13;
16.        Indicating with Cs the consumption vector of the s-th consumer, the&#13;
Pareto optimal problem could now be stated as follows:&#13;
U  = [ U   (C)] is maximum if there exists no feasible C1 such that&#13;
US (C1)    U U  (C°) for all s and US (C1) &gt; uS (C°) for at least one s.&#13;
17.        As Negishi (Metroeconomica, 1960) has shown, solving the Pareto&#13;
optimal problem is equivalent to maximizing any convex combination of&#13;
consumers' utilities. In the context of model (5) this implies that the&#13;
objective function be written as:&#13;
S&#13;
Max   U  =       V   Us (CV           &gt;0                                   (19)&#13;
s=l          C5&#13;
18.        The Vq can be interpreted as distribution weights.      Any system of&#13;
weights will lead to a Pareto optimum if problem (19) is solved under the&#13;
constraints specified in (5).&#13;
19.        Assuming equal weights for all consumers (Vs = 1, s = 1, ... S),&#13;
we can write from the first order conditions:&#13;
DU aU          and   aU  =   DU                                          (20)&#13;
~Cj5   ac        a       a&#13;
s= 1,2    .. S&#13;
i = 1,2  ... n&#13;
Substituting (.20) into (18) we thus obtain:&#13;
aU   =   au   p            i = 1,2 ... n                               (21)&#13;
aci      ay    i&#13;
For a traded good, substituting (21) into (7) yields:&#13;
au   Pi -au     Pi = 0                                                 (22)&#13;
or, using the definition given in (14):&#13;
= a*     P=   a P       i = 1,2 ... n                               (23)&#13;
i y    i      i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-&#13;
For a traded good affected by a distortion such as, for example, an import&#13;
tariff, we also have by definition that:&#13;
P= rpi (1 + ti)                                                      (24)&#13;
where ti is the tariff rate and r the official exchange rate.     Since ax is&#13;
a conversion factor common to all prices it will thus be impossible to meet&#13;
the pricing rule defined by (7) or (23) for a good directly affected by the&#13;
distortion. For unprotected goods, on the other hand, the rule can still&#13;
be applied in the sense that domestic prices are required to be proportional&#13;
to border prices. The factor of proportionality, however, is a function of&#13;
all price distortions and remains to be determined.&#13;
20.       The interpretation of at in the general case when all sorts of distor-&#13;
tions may affect domestic markets is thus important to establish what rule&#13;
to follow to determine "second best" prices. Assuming foreign exchange&#13;
availability to be determined exogenously, the inverse value a has&#13;
a clear interpretation since it represents the increase in expenditure&#13;
in domestic currency generated by an exogenous increase in the availability&#13;
of foreign currency. Clearly both the increase and the ways by which&#13;
additional foreign exchange is generated depend on government policies.&#13;
A general definition can be written as follows:&#13;
nl     aEi&#13;
_ aY    1      i-l                                                 (25)&#13;
r    Y*   a       n1  * aEi +   n1 w*  ay.&#13;
E  p *                -&#13;
i__1i 3g  j=l    3   a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-60-&#13;
A&#13;
where r is used to indicate the shadow exchange rate nature of the inverse&#13;
conversion factor, Ei = ci - xi and g represents the particular policy&#13;
instrument used to increase foreign exchange availability.&#13;
21.       Several cases may be distinguished for the evaluation of r that&#13;
depend on alternative government policies to increase foreign exchange&#13;
availability:&#13;
(A) Reduction in domestic consumption&#13;
(B) Variation of official exchange rate (devaluation)&#13;
(C) Variation of a particular price or set of prices&#13;
(D) Increase in investment&#13;
In all cases the expression for the shadow exchange rate can be formulated&#13;
in more familiar notation as follows:&#13;
^   X i   1 + t  ) +  X  yi Mi ( 1 + t   )&#13;
ij    i         ix     j      i     +   im)                             (26)&#13;
r=&#13;
i e    x +    i  i   M&#13;
where   E. = elasticity of export supply with respect to policy instrument&#13;
n, = elasticity of import demand with respect to policy instrument&#13;
Xi = value of exports of i-th commodity&#13;
M. = value of imports of i-th commodity&#13;
tix= ad valorem tax on exports&#13;
ti = ad valorem tax on imports&#13;
im&#13;
22.       The problem with cul.putation of (26), however. is not only that import&#13;
and export elasticities corresponding to (A) - (D) are generally unknown,&#13;
but also that, depending on a particular government policy, they beg the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
question of which is the best policy or set of foreign exchange procurement&#13;
policies. Fortunately, it turns out that in most cases a good approximation&#13;
of (25) is provided by&#13;
R     fiE Xi ( 1 + tix) + E  b  (+    im)&#13;
r ~~                     i&#13;
(27)&#13;
i Xi    +      i   Mi&#13;
ii             i&#13;
23.       To evaluate the approximation involved in (26), we write the&#13;
Taylor expansion of r in (25) around Ei'ni = 1.    After simple algebraic&#13;
transformations, such an expansion can be written as follows:&#13;
A   ~&#13;
r      r         (X   Tx ) + ( M - Tm)   (Tx + Tm)     +                  (28)&#13;
( X + M)2&#13;
where   TX =      xtj       = value of taxes on exports&#13;
T  =      M   t   = value of taxes on imports&#13;

3. More on Conversion Factors&#13;
25.        The simple formula obtained in (25) reflects only a limited range&#13;
of distortions and is implicitly based on the hypothesis that the country is&#13;
a price taker in the international market. Special conversion factors can be&#13;
obtained, however, to account for a wider range of distortions and/or&#13;
hypothesis.&#13;
26.        In order to derive these expressions from a general formulation,&#13;
consider the case in which we seek to determine the optimum shadow price of&#13;
good j at consumption and production level. Maximizing (6) w.r. to pj is then&#13;
equivalent to maximize (19) under the equilibrium assumption Vs= 1.        Taking&#13;
derivatives with respect to pj, yields, for the consumption side:&#13;
n    Du   ac.       n        dC         n        Dce&#13;
fl   n--1          1                    n * iE 7                             2&#13;

i=l     i    j      i=l                  1 e=n1+j&#13;
27.        If consumers maximize utility in domestic distorted markets we&#13;
must have:&#13;
DU       Du    c         c&#13;
ac.  =    Y   Pi     U  Pi                                             (30:&#13;
where U   is the marginal utility of income in domestic currency and pi is&#13;
0 &#13;
the price faced by domestic consumers (demand price). Note now that p is&#13;
the marginal utility of foreign exchange Y* at the constrained optimum of&#13;
U (c) obtained by shadow pricing the consumption level of the j-th good.&#13;
I/UO = DY/3Y* will thus reflect the marginal rate of substitution between&#13;
domestic and foreign currency at the same level. Denoting this conditioned&#13;
C&#13;
value of the conversion factor as     acv  we can thus write, for the small&#13;
country case:&#13;
n1   *   c&#13;

1    i        i    i           J&#13;
the i-th good and the j-th price.     For the Robinson-Metzler case of zero cross&#13;
price elasticities a    is simply:&#13;
i&#13;
ac =  Pi    =   r                                                        (32r&#13;

Pi          i&#13;
where r is the official exchange rate.     Thus the consumption conversion factor for&#13;
the i-th good equals the ratio of the official exchange rate and the Nominal Protec-&#13;
tion Coefficient-.   In the large country case p* is replaced by marginal revenue,&#13;
1&#13;
that is, in the simple case of (32):&#13;
c  P~~~1                                                            (33)&#13;

the elasticity between factor demand for the k-th factor and price of the j-th&#13;

Expression (35) implies that unlike demand, supply shadow prices and conversion&#13;
factors depend on the existence of non-traded goods and/or factors. In the&#13;
1/ Computed at the retail level.&#13;
&#13;

29.       The conversion factor for the i-th production price can thus be&#13;
interpreted as an inverse marginal cost of foreign exchange (DRC) in the&#13;
production of the i-th good: it represents the increase in net foreign&#13;
exchange earnings that would follow an increase (or decrease) in supply of&#13;
the i-th good or an increase (decrease) in supply of any input used for its&#13;
fabrication. In the particular case of input-output technology (zero elasticity&#13;
of substitution among factors) the derivative ayk/DPj can be decomposed into&#13;
input-output and supply response coefficients:&#13;
ayk     ayk   ax i         axi                                            (37&#13;
-=i     axi   ap   =  -ki  3pi&#13;
Substituting into (34) yields, for the zero cross elasticity case:&#13;
(V*   -   E   W )r    X&#13;
x       i    ~~k-1                __&#13;
ax   =            mk=l             =   C      DRC                          (38&#13;
,   Wg ii&#13;
g=m1+l&#13;
where DRC indicates the domestic resource coefficient as defined by Bruno&#13;
and r is the shadow exchange rate. Thus, under partial equilibrium input-output&#13;
technology assumptions, the conversion factor for production equals the inverse&#13;
of Bruno's domestic resource cost coefficient. Again, the large country case&#13;
can simply be taken into account by using marginal revenues (expenditures)&#13;
instead of prices:&#13;

where n* is the elasticity of foreign (demand) supply for the i-th good and&#13;
i&#13;
e* is the elasticity of foreign supply for the k-th factor.&#13;
k&#13;
30.        Consumption and production conversion factors can thus be interpreted&#13;
as net foreign exchange values of increases in consumption or production of a&#13;
given good or combination of goods. When applied separately, they presuppose&#13;
a situation where pricing is applied only to consumption or production either&#13;
because the project acts only at either of these levels or because the possibilities&#13;
of reinforcing prices other than (distorted) market prices are limited. In&#13;
all other cases the appropriate conversion factor is a weighted average of the&#13;
two. For the small country general case, in particular, the conversion factor&#13;
U&#13;
is obtained by summing expressions (29) and (34) and solving for          -&#13;

Appendix II&#13;
PRICE EFFECTS ON AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY&#13;
I. Introduction&#13;
1.        Agricultural supply responses have regained much attention in the&#13;
last decade as development economics has focused on problems of dual economies&#13;
and food shortages. Furthermore, the question as to the responsibility of&#13;
exercising collective bargaining power for agricultural exports was also&#13;
raised after the success of OPEC's oil embargo and recent concern of govern-&#13;
ment and aid institutions on basic need and income distribution policies have&#13;
reinforced the necessity to increase our understanding on agricultural supply&#13;
responses. This Appendix presents evidence from two surveys on the subject&#13;
and from direct perusal of a number of recent studies, with the objective to&#13;
summarize the empirical information available in a way that may facilitate&#13;
its use in policy analysis.&#13;
2.        In developing countries on-farm consumption is often a large share&#13;
of farmers' production. This portion can be subtracted from production to&#13;
measure supply response of marketed surplus. Alternatively, total acreage&#13;
(output) response can be defined to include on-farm consumption. In both cases,&#13;
it is important to consider the evaluation of demand responses in determining&#13;
the net supply responses. Own consumption response may be analyzed with a&#13;
different model framework than the one used for household consumption data.&#13;
One main difference is due to the fact that the farm income level is positively&#13;
related to price increase and, as a result, on-farm consumption responses to&#13;
crop price increases can also be positive. This positive demand response can&#13;
partly offset the production response and lower the net responsiveness of&#13;
marketed supply to price changes. Therefore, the distinction between production&#13;
responses and marketed surplus responses should be kept in mind when comparing&#13;
effects of various price intervention policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-68-&#13;
3.        The majority of the supply response studies concentrate on measure-&#13;
ment of acreage response. Since production response can always be decomposed&#13;
into an acreage and yield response, the acreage response is a good measure of&#13;
total production response only if yield response is small. The latter condition&#13;
is subject to empirical testing. When substitution between land and other&#13;
inputs such as labor, fertilizer, irrigation and new seeds is possible to any&#13;
significant extent, yield responses may be considerable. On the other hand,&#13;
because actual production levels reflect the influence of factors such as weather,&#13;
plant diseases and infrastructure, measuring supply response with production&#13;
levels is not without flaws.&#13;
4.        A further issue of importance in evaluating supply responses is the&#13;
relationship between output price and the profitability of crop production.&#13;
Clearly, relative rather than absolute prices are likely to affect profitability.&#13;
In principle there are three different ways to define the numeraire to compute&#13;
relative farm prices: price of other crops, prices of inputs, or prices of&#13;
goods farmers may consume. From a more general point of view, it can be even&#13;
agreed that the relative profitability of a particular production activity can&#13;
be compared not only with the alternative farm production activities, but also&#13;
with other nonagricultural activities--such as selling out the land for building&#13;
factories and migration to urban areas to be a wage earner. Because degrees of&#13;
freedom and data problems generally restrict the choice of the numeraire and/or&#13;
the number of decision variables to be included in the response equation, the&#13;
choices usuallv made are not necessarily satisfactory.&#13;
5.        The supply response models used in the literature surveyed are typically&#13;
based on a reduced form composed of only observable variables:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-69-&#13;
T&#13;
n   Tk&#13;
y  =  0+  y -,+  E   k  bikx'kt-i, &#13;
t   a1            k=l i=l                                          (1)&#13;
where yt is the supply of a given product at time t, and Xkt is the realized&#13;
value of an explanatory variable at time t (generally represented by the price&#13;
or the unit revenue of the crop y or of an altervative crop). The number of&#13;
explanatory variables is n, while the number of lags for each k variable is Tk.&#13;
6.        Two basic formal structures can be used to give theoretical justifica-&#13;
1/&#13;
tion to the reduced form in (1): Nerlove adaptive expectation model-= and&#13;
2/&#13;
Koyck and Cagan distributed lag models.-     The Nerlovian formulation rests on the&#13;
twofold assumption of: (i) a progressive and constant adjustment of short run&#13;
supply to its long run value and, (ii) a recursive formation of price expectations.&#13;
In algebraic terms these two assumptions can be written as follows:&#13;
Yt   Ytl1 +YYtYt-l)        ;       y&lt; 1                              (2)&#13;
*    *                *&#13;
t    t-       ( t-1   t-1) ; 0 &lt;    &lt; 1                            (3)&#13;
where the asterisks indicate the expected or long term value of the variable;&#13;
Yt denotes supply and Pt price.&#13;
7.        Equations (2) and (3) can be used independently or jointly to provide&#13;
a theoretical justification to equation (1). Assuming expected or long run&#13;
supply to be regulated by an equation of the type:&#13;
*          *&#13;
Yt = a + cPt                                                         (4)&#13;
we obtain, after substituting the values of yt and Pt given by (2) and (3):&#13;
Yt = a + (1 - Y) yt 1 + cy         (1 _   i1 Pt i                    (5)&#13;
1/ Nerlove (1956, 1958).&#13;
2/ Koyck (1954) and Griliches (1967).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70-&#13;
Multiplying the expression for Yt 1 according to (5) by 1 - 6 and subtracting&#13;
from (5) yields the reduced form:&#13;
Yt =a    +               - (1-    ) (l - Y) yt-2 + cyS Pt_1            (6)&#13;
where a. = a(l - A)&#13;
8.         Koyck and Cagan's models are based on the equation:&#13;
n    X&#13;
yt    a  +      i E   ik xkt-i&#13;
~~     k=l   i=l&#13;
This equation can be related to (1) by assuming a particular polynomial&#13;
structure for the weights eik' The simplest formulation due to Koyck is based&#13;
on a geometrically declining form:&#13;
eik = 8k S(l - 6)               i = 1, 2, . . .                        (8)&#13;
Substituting (8) into (7) yields after multiplying the corresponding expression&#13;
for yt-1 by (1 - a) and subtracting from      t&#13;
n&#13;
=a+ (1 -aZ                8kXatl                                 (9)&#13;

k=l&#13;
where a = a 8&#13;
o     o&#13;
9.         As an alternative to (7), one can postulate a finite distributed&#13;
lag for expected price:&#13;
*    T&#13;
Pt-=    l   p                                                          (10)&#13;
i=l      t-&#13;
and use it in conjunction with equations (2) and (4) to yield.&#13;
T&#13;
Yt =a + (1 -y) yt       + yc   E  a   t                           (11)&#13;
t-1    i=l &#13;
ln.        Equations (6), (9) and (11) are the most common models for agricultural&#13;
supply response estimates. In all these models direct estimates of the price&#13;
coefficients yield estimates of "short run" parameters of supply response (in&#13;
the case of log-log functions, "short run" elasticities). "Long run" parameters&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-&#13;
are obtained by dividing the short run parameters by the partial adjustment&#13;
coefficient or the product of it and price expectation coefficient. As it is&#13;
clear from the different formulations, the concept of long run varies with the&#13;
three models: it assumes completion of an adjustment process concerning only&#13;
planned supply in model (11), only adaptive price expectations in model (9)&#13;
and both supply and prices in model (6).&#13;

PRICE EFFECTS ON DEMANDS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS&#13;
I. Introduction&#13;
1.01     Among its many wide-range applications, estimation of price&#13;
elasticity of demand is particularly useful for: demand projection and&#13;
industrial forecasting, sector economic planning, commodity market&#13;
stabilization, and in evaluating the effects of projects or government&#13;
policies of protection and subsidy. Thus, statistical evidence of demand&#13;
elasticities is available for many diverse data samples in accordance&#13;
with different purposes of estimation. In this survey, we have included&#13;
analyses based on: (i) single country time series data, (ii) single&#13;
country household survey data, (iii) single country panel data (i.e., survey&#13;
follow-up data with the same households), (iv) cross-nation time series&#13;
data, and, (v), internationally aggregated data.&#13;
1.02     It is obvious that price elasticities estimated from these&#13;
diverse samples cannot be directly compared. It is then up to planners'&#13;
judgment to choose appropriate estimates in analysis. It is commonly&#13;
assumed 1/ that elasticities obtained from the cross-section data characterize&#13;
the long-run behavior, while the results obtained from time-series data&#13;
are more appropriate in medium or short-run projection. However, this&#13;
assumption does not imply that cross-section elsticities are necessarily&#13;
greater than time series ones. For one thing, the measurements of variables&#13;
are generally different from two approaches: disposable income is typically&#13;
used in time-series analysis while expenditure level is often the only&#13;
income-like variable available in household surveys. In many cases, price&#13;
variables are not even introduced in the demand specification of household&#13;
survey studies. In addition, the demand theory framework used in two&#13;
approaches can be very different. As a result, the difference between&#13;
the magnitudes of demand elasticities so estimated cannot be totally&#13;
attributed to the distinction between long-run and short-run phenomena.-&#13;
In fact, some authors even believe that both approaches describe the same&#13;
universal phenomenon. 2/ Mundlak (1964), for example, observes that the two&#13;
sets of estimates tend to agree when broader classification of agricultural&#13;
products are used. 3/&#13;
1.03     The degree of commodity disaggregation should depend on the purpose&#13;
of estimation. From the planner's viewpoint, a broader classification of&#13;
agricultural products is generally sufficient. But, from the industry&#13;
forecasting aspect, more detailed breakdown is needed. Nevertheless,&#13;
1/  For example, Holmes (1968), Bussink (1970), Houthakker (1965), NCAER (1970),&#13;
and Weisskof (1971) all share this view. In fewer incidences the opposite&#13;
view is also held. One example of the latter is Anderson (1969) who views&#13;
the cross-section results as static results and a downward bias in&#13;
elasticity estimation.&#13;
2/ Such as Weisskoff (1971) and Mundlak (1964).&#13;

aggregation in commodity will reduce the magnitude of substitution effect.&#13;
Even within the same industry, the substitution effects of demand for&#13;
products of different processing stages may show a large variation. For&#13;
example, demand for chocolate products will have different price elasticity&#13;
from that of cocoa beans. Therefore, it is possible for a policy to have&#13;
substantial effect on demand structure of food items although the aggregate&#13;
food demand remains rather inelastic to price changes. Also, it is&#13;
possible to change the magnitudes of agricultural intermediate inputs'&#13;
demand by price policies, even if the final demands of these products&#13;
may be price inelastic.&#13;
1.04     Readers are also reminded that demand elasticities estimated from&#13;
household survey data refer to household consumption demand. Thus, industrial&#13;
demand for materials and intermediate inputs and farm demand for feed are&#13;
not included in estimating demand function 6f food items. This certainly&#13;
can be a source of important differences in the estimated size of the&#13;
elasticities with time series estimates. Time series studies, in fact,&#13;
measure demand for a given food item by the sum of production and imports&#13;
(net of exports) adjusted by changes in stocks.&#13;
1.05     It is not our intention to compare the superiority of the time-series&#13;
versus household survey approach. Rather, we would like to point out that&#13;
each type of study has its own advantages and shortcomings. For example,&#13;
while it is easier to evaluate price elasticities in the time-series approach,&#13;
these estimates tend to be biased because of the collinearity property&#13;
between income and price data over time. Cross sections, on the other hand,&#13;
are more convenient to include the effects on demand of socio-economic&#13;
factors such as occupation and education of household head, age of family&#13;
members, family size, geographic location of the household, etc.&#13;
1.06     A particular segment of the literature on aggregate demand analysis&#13;
concerns the so called commodity studies. Demand elasticities in these&#13;
studies refer to the responses in world demand for a specific commodity&#13;
to the changes in its price. 1/ These elasticities are directly applicable&#13;
to commodity stabilization studies. While they are not directly useful&#13;
to individual country's analysis, if additional information such as the market&#13;
share of the country and the supply elasticity of the rest of the world are&#13;
provided, from the world-wide aggregated elasticities one can estimate the&#13;
demand elasticities for a particular country. These elasticities in turn&#13;
can be used in national policy evaluation.&#13;
II. Empirical Evidences of Price Effects&#13;
2.01     Our survey of elasticity estimates is systematized into two tables&#13;
according to the nature of data sample. Table 1 contains results for&#13;
individual Less Developed Country's estimates, while Table 2 summarizes world&#13;
wide aggregate commodity studies. These tables start with demand for all&#13;
1/ The commodity price is measured either by weighted price index (including&#13;
export unit valued index) or the spot price in commodity market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

food, then continue to list the elasticitiesof major agricultural&#13;
crops such as:  rice, wheat, maize, root crops, pulses, vegetables, fruits,&#13;
sugar, meats (beef, pork, poultry, fish), oils, milk, milk products, cocoa,&#13;
coffee, tea, tobacco, cotton, wool, etc. The survey is by no means exhaustive&#13;
and is limited to the Anglo-American literature with only occasional&#13;
excursions in studies carried out in LDC's {mainly India, Pakistan,&#13;
Philippines).&#13;
2.02     The front section of Table 1 consists of total food demand.&#13;
Lluch (1977) and Weisskoff (1971) are two major sources of these elasticities.&#13;
Lluch (1977) has applied the ELES (Extended Linear Expenditure System) model&#13;
in estimate aggregate demands of 17 countries. This ELES model differs&#13;
from the well-known LES 1/ (Linear Expenditure System) by allowing for the&#13;
endogenous determination of total expenditure level. In the estimation, a&#13;
maximum likelihood iteration method was used. The price elasticity is&#13;
indirectly derived from the expenditure elasticity and other estimated&#13;
parameters such as average budget shares. While Weisskoff (1971) included&#13;
15 countries in his study, only estimates for LDCs are presented. No systematic&#13;
differences in the elasticity estimates appear to exist between the two&#13;
studies.&#13;
2.03     In the individual countries' demand analysis for major crops,&#13;
(reported in Table 1) the most common models are the log linear single&#13;
equation and the Frisch scheme. The former generally gives rather good&#13;
statistical fitting. The popularity of Frisch scheme, on the other hand, is&#13;
probably due to the simplicity of its computation; instead of estimating&#13;
directly all cross price elasticities, extraneous information are used to&#13;
estimate the money flexibility parameter first, and then to derive all cross&#13;
price elasticities. To replace this method, a simultaneous system of demand&#13;
equations is sometimes needed to estimate a set of interrelated demands.&#13;
Haessel's (1976) study is one such example. Results are reported in Table 1.&#13;
2.04     In order to have an overall picture on the magnitudes of price&#13;
elasticities that we have collected, Table 3 summarizes some of the information&#13;
of the first two tables. This table shows that the majority of LDCs have&#13;
price elasticity of total food demand within the range of one third to two&#13;
thirds. For "necessities" such as rice, wheat, oils and sugar, more&#13;
countries have price elasticities lower than one third. For the same items,&#13;
however, some countries have higher-than-one price elasticities. In these&#13;
cases the specific item is generally not a traditional food item in the national&#13;
diet. As for'other relative luxury or semi-luxury items such as meats and&#13;
dairy products, price elasticities often fall within the range of one-third&#13;
to two-thirds. Other non-necessity food items including coffee, tea, cocoa&#13;
and tobacco appear to have very low price elasticities.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The research has confirmed that there is
            extensive intervention with market forces by governments in
            LDCs, which has turned the domestic terms of trade against
            agriculture and has significant efficiency and income
            distribution effects. Methodologies which include the use of
            nominal and effective protection coefficients, domestic
            resource cost, and net economic benefit coefficients,
            producer and consumer subsidy equivalents and producer and
            consumer surpluses - are evaluated in terms of their
            capacity: (a) to provide Bank staff with operationally
            useful instruments of analysis; (b) to offer appropriate
            advice to client country governments and their planning
            institutions concerned with pricing policies; and (c) to
            help bridge the methodological gap between project
            cost-benefit analysis on the one hand and sector and country
            economic work on the other hand. While the microeconomic
            methodologies have their limitations, they do provide useful
            tools of analysis, especially for countries which have sets
            of national parameters (accounting prices and conversion
            factors), which can also be used in project cost-benefit analysis.
