this Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the&#13;
Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a&#13;
fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration&#13;
Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its&#13;
Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") will be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard&#13;
policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to&#13;
prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to&#13;
give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of&#13;
Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any&#13;
obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules&#13;
and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall&#13;
be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may&#13;
be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as&#13;
trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3   Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency&#13;
other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying&#13;
Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the&#13;
exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be&#13;
insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the&#13;
Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the&#13;
date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5   The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment&#13;
of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to&#13;
the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.    Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1   The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment,&#13;
an amount equal to two percent (2 %) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;

and Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above&#13;
as an administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the Administration Agreements in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund&#13;
on an actual basis up to a maximum of two decimal eight percent (2.8%) of the total Contributions&#13;
under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3   Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of&#13;
the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs&#13;
change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and&#13;
Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements&#13;
of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided&#13;
either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors&#13;
under new Administration Agreements.&#13;

cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust&#13;
funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall&#13;
be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank will first consult as to whether&#13;
such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor will agree on the appropriate scope&#13;
and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the&#13;
Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs&#13;
of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;

scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information&#13;
within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including&#13;
any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review&#13;
or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.    Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank&#13;

the Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors)&#13;
after such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Agreement of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall&#13;

manner specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the&#13;
total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the&#13;

manner specified by each such Donor in its respective Administration Agreement the pro rata&#13;
share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the Trust Fund, in accordance with any additional&#13;

1818 H Street, N.W.&#13;
Washington, D.C. 20433&#13;
U.S.A.&#13;
Ref: Administration Agreement to be made between KfW and the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association concerning the&#13;
Zambia Multi Donor Trust Fund for the Public Financial Management Reform Program (TF No&#13;
TF072158)&#13;
Dear Mr. Subramanian,&#13;
we herewith refer to the above mentioned Administration Agreement, and in particular to Section 3&#13;
of said agreement.&#13;
As discussed between legal representatives of the Worldbank and KfW on 07 August 2014 KfW&#13;
herewith re-iterates the following which has been the common understanding during the discussion:&#13;
The funds amounting to EUR 7 million provided to the Multi Donor Trust Fund for the Public Financial&#13;
Management Reform Program (TF No TF072158) by German Financial Cooperation (KfW) are&#13;
foreseen to be disbursed into the Trust Fund account until the end of December 2016 the latest.&#13;
After that date KfW might not be in a position to disburse any outstanding amounts into the Trust&#13;
Fund account due to statutary German budget law.&#13;
Therefore, in the event of delays in the implementation of activities and/or (corresponding) delays of&#13;
payment requests by the Worldbank KfW might not be able to amend the installment schedule&#13;
beyond 31 Dec 2016 and Section 3 of the Administration Agreement shall be interpreted in such way.&#13;
Yours sincerely&#13;
KfW&#13;
&#13;
