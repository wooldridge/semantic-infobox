COASTAL EMBANKMENT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
I.  PROJECT AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Project Background&#13;
1.1       Natural calamities are a recurring phenomenon in Bangladesh.  The&#13;
most severe occur in the form of cyclonic storms which affect the coastal&#13;
districts. The country has over 700 km of coastline on the mainland and&#13;
several offshore islands in the Bay of Bengal. Vulnerable areas include the&#13;
important port towns of Chittagong and Khulna, and the heavily populated&#13;
islands of Sandwip, Kutubdiya and Hatiya. During the last 125 years, over 42&#13;
cyclones hit the coastal belt; 14 occurred during the last 25 years. Cyclones&#13;
often cause major destruction of human life, livestock, crops, properties, and&#13;
physical infrastructure. Such cyclones also tax the country's institutional&#13;
and financial capabilities, since resources have to be diverted to provide&#13;
immediate relief to the affected population and to restore damaged or&#13;
destroyed physical facilities.&#13;
1.2       Recent cyclones causing widespread devastation and loss of life&#13;
occurred in November 1970, May 1985, November 1988, and April 1991. After the&#13;
cyclone of November 1970, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB), assisted by IDA&#13;
under the Coastal Area Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 339-BD) and other donors,&#13;
initiated a reconstruction program aimed at (a) rehabilitation of the economy&#13;
of the affected areas, and (b) provision of protection from future cyclones.&#13;
The benefits of these investments were demonstrated during the cyclone of May&#13;
1985. For example, the coastal embankment withstood the tidal surge at the&#13;
peak period and although the embankment was overtopped or breached in several&#13;
places, the energy of the tidal surge was dissipated and, by and large, houses&#13;
remained in site. The radio system also worked satisfactorily and conveyed&#13;
warnings of the advent of the cyclone, and the cyclone shelters and other&#13;
facilities were used effectively. Due to these improvements, loss of life and&#13;
damage to infrastructure were relatively limited. However, destruction was&#13;
almost total on the unembanked islands and the newly accreted parts of the&#13;
mainland where most people, with their houses and livestock, were swept away&#13;
by the tidal wave. By the time of the April 1991 cyclone, the embankments&#13;
were in a poor state of maintenance, and were breached in many locations. The&#13;
cyclone caused about 140,000 deaths, and severe damage throughout the eastern&#13;
coast of the Bay of Bengal. Had the embankments been in better condition, the&#13;
damage would have been much less severe.&#13;
1.3       In 1986 GOB formulated a National Cyclone Protection Program&#13;
including proposed programs for improving the existing coastal embankment;&#13;
protecting newly accreted lands; developing forests; improving&#13;
telecommunications, roads and coastal transport; and providing improved and&#13;
less costly cyclone shelters, to be used also as schools and health&#13;
facilities. Improvements to the coastal embankments and protection of newly&#13;
accreted land were to be undertaken in two phases. The mid-term program would&#13;
strengthen existing coastal embankments, while the long-term program would&#13;
include the construction of embankments and associated structures for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
protection of newly accreted lands. After various delays, caused in part by&#13;
the 1987 and 1988 floods, a contract was signed with consultants (a joint&#13;
venture led by KAMPSAX International) financed by the European Community (EC),&#13;
which included provision for preparation of the mid-term program and&#13;
developing TOR for a study of the long-term program.&#13;
1.4       The consultants' studies were in progress when the April 1991&#13;
cyclone struck. At GOB's request, the World Bank agreed to coordinate donor&#13;
assistance. The Government also requested the consultants to prepare plans&#13;
and designs for a Priority Works Program (PWP) to provide for the most&#13;
urgently needed embankment repair and rehabilitation work. Meanwhile, the&#13;
World Food Programme (WFP) financed earthworks to provide temporary protection&#13;
until the full embankments can be constructed. Funding was arranged from&#13;
Saudi Arabia (about US$13.3 million equivalent), a Japanese grant (about&#13;
US$23 million equivalent, under IDA administration), EC (about US$4 million),&#13;
and US$29 million from amendments to IDA credits 1467, 1784, 1870, and 2048,&#13;
for a program including about 135 km of embankment rehabilitation and about 55&#13;
km of new retired embankments. Work has been substantially completed except&#13;
for one polder where there were objections to the planned alignment, and a&#13;
second where additional drainage improvements have been found necessary. A&#13;
new alignment has now been agreed and about $3 million equivalent for&#13;
completion of the work for the two polders is proposed for financing under&#13;
this proposed credit.&#13;
1.5       Following the April 1991 cyclone, there was increased recognition&#13;
that reliable protection of human lives can be provided at the most economic&#13;
cost through a program of construction of additional cyclone shelters combined&#13;
with establishment of an appropriate cyclone disaster preparedness system.&#13;
Proposals for such a project are being prepared separately for consideration&#13;
in FY97. A component to improve road access to facilitate post-cyclone relief&#13;
operations, originally proposed as part of this project, is now being financed&#13;
by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The proposed cyclone embankment&#13;
rehabilitation works under this project would complement the above efforts by&#13;
providing partial protection of crops and infrastructure, as well as&#13;
additional protection of human lives even after the construction of an&#13;
appropriate number of shelters. Even in areas of adequate shelters, a portion&#13;
of the population does not leave their homes (since most cyclones do not turn&#13;
out to be severe and leaving home risks theft of possessions). Moreover,&#13;
embankments provide inhabitants more time to reach shelters safely.&#13;
1.6       While the project was originally planned primarily in terms of&#13;
cyclone protection, it has important benefits in increasing agricultural&#13;
production, through protecting coastal agricultural areas from saline&#13;
inundation during normal annual monsoons and improved cropping patterns due to&#13;
reduced cyclone risks, and better drainage. Most of the proposed project&#13;
works would be economically viable on the basis of such increases in&#13;
agricultural production, even without the benefits of the project in reducing&#13;
cyclone damages and saving lives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. The Agriculture Sector&#13;
The Setting and Recent Trends&#13;
1.7       Agriculture, consisting of crops, fisheries, livestock, and&#13;
forestry subsectors, is still the predominant sector of Bangladesh's economy.&#13;
Its relative share of GDP, even though on a declining trend, remains high.&#13;
The share has fallen from about 53% in FY73 to 43% in FY83 and to 36% in FY92&#13;
(at constant 1984/85 prices). Processed and unprocessed agricultural&#13;
products, though also declining in relative importance, account for about 32%&#13;
of the country's export earnings. Agriculture also has significant forward&#13;
and backward linkages with other sectors. It supplies raw materials for the&#13;
most important single manufacturing subsector, jute, and for smaller&#13;
industries like food processing, tobacco manufacturing, leather tanning, and&#13;
pulp and paper. It is the market for the growing fertilizer industry. Trade&#13;
and transport of agricultural goods and inputs account for a large percentage&#13;
of these sectors' contribution to GDP. Agriculture employs over 60* of the&#13;
country's civilian population, provides the principal livelihood for most of&#13;
the poor.&#13;
1.8       The sector is dominated by the crop subsector, especially rice.&#13;
Crop production accounts for almost 70% of the value of agricultural output&#13;
while fisheries, livestock, and forestry each account for about 10%. The&#13;
share of foodgrains in the value of agricultural output is about 50%. Within&#13;
the foodgrains, rice accounts for about 90% of the value of output while wheat&#13;
accounts for 6%.&#13;
1.9       Overall, growth in agricultural production slowed in the 1970s due&#13;
to war, floods, drought, and inappropriate policy decisions. Growth increased&#13;
moderately in the early 1980s. There was a substantial upsurge in growth in&#13;
the late 1980s, based on trends in irrigation and fertilizer usage, which were&#13;
not immediately visible in increased crop production due to severe floods in&#13;
FY88 and FY89. Based upon these underlying trends, crop production jumped by&#13;
9W in FY90. Rice production, which had been growing at about 2% per annum&#13;
between FY61 and FY89, increased by almost 15% between FY89 and FY90. Policy&#13;
reforms involving privatization of the distribution of fertilizer and minor&#13;
irrigation equipment and resulting in rapid expansion of minor irrigation&#13;
(permitting multicropping and growing high yielding variety rice in the dry&#13;
season) accounted for the jump in rice production. However, this led to&#13;
unprecedented declines in rice prices leading to reduced incentives for&#13;
further rapid expansion. During the period FY90 through FY93 crop production&#13;
grew at only slightly more than 1% per year. The fisheries subsector, in&#13;
contrast, has been growing at over 6% per year during the 1990s.&#13;
1.10      As a result of the acceleration in rice production, Bangladesh,&#13;
which had long been dependent upon food aid to meet minimal foodgrain&#13;
requirements, achieved rice self-sufficiency in years of normal weather and&#13;
even began to export small quantities of rice. (In years of poor weather such&#13;
as FY94/95, shortages of rice still occur.) If Bangladesh is to continue to&#13;
expand agricultural production and take advantage of opportunities for&#13;
expansion of low-cost irrigation, it must begin to diversify production&#13;
(including export quality rice as well as other crops.) This requires the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
spread of knowledge of appropriate production methods, through improved&#13;
effectiveness of research and extension (both public and private sector).&#13;
Nevertheless, some expansion of rice production in line with Bangladesh's&#13;
comparative advantage will still be required to meet the needs of the growing&#13;
population.&#13;
Aaricultural Development Obiectives and Strateav&#13;
1.11      In light of the country's heavy dependence on food aid, GOB's main&#13;
objective for agriculture since independence has been to achieve food security&#13;
through a policy of food self-sufficiency, the latter being interpreted&#13;
largely as a drive to achieve self-sufficiency in the production of rice, the&#13;
staple foodgrain. GOB has set two major goals for the agriculture sector in&#13;
the current Five-Year Plan (FY91-95): (a) attaining foodgrain (rice)&#13;
self-sufficiency by the end of the plan period; and (b) increasing the&#13;
production of minor but nutritionally important crops to improve the quality&#13;
of food consumption. Attainment of these objectives would also reduce&#13;
poverty.&#13;
1.12      Since independence, the primary emphasis of development efforts in&#13;
agriculture has been to replace the traditional cultivation methods,&#13;
characterized by low and sharply fluctuating yields, by more modern techniques&#13;
leading to higher production and sustained growth. The poor performance of&#13;
the sector was identified with the low level of technology characterizing&#13;
traditional agriculture and overwhelming dependence on weather. A&#13;
breakthrough in agriculture was considered primarily dependent on a strategy&#13;
of a rapid expansion of irrigation-fertilizer-seed technology. The current&#13;
Five-Year Plan articulates a strategy for achieving more rapid agricultural&#13;
growth, emphasizing the need to shift from high risk, monsoon-dependent&#13;
production to lower risk, irrigated production. This is to be achieved&#13;
primarily through expanding minor irrigation coverage, stimulating crop&#13;
diversification, relying more on competitive markets for input supply to&#13;
farmers, improving rural transport infrastructure, strengthening agricultural&#13;
research and extension systems to develop new technologies and diffuse the&#13;
proven technologies to farmers, making adequate credit available to finance&#13;
needed investments, and improving the macroeconomic policy environment.&#13;
1.13      The strategy for the sector, as spelled out in the current Five-&#13;
Year Plan, is basically consistent with the consensus arising from intensive&#13;
dialogue within GOB and between GOB and donor agencies in general, and IDA,&#13;
the Asian Development Bank, the European Community, the Overseas Development&#13;
Administration of the U.K., and the U.S. Agency for International Development&#13;
(USAID), in particular. The dialogue has been based on the findings of sector&#13;
work that has been carried out by IDA and other donors. It has been&#13;
demonstrated that minor irrigation equipment (shallow tubewells, deep&#13;
tubewells, and low lift pumps) has to be the method of choice for expanded&#13;
irrigation on grounds of cost per irrigated hectare, ease of management,&#13;
minimum reliance on public resources, and affordability by farmers. Expansion&#13;
of minor irrigation is also the only alternative that would bring quick&#13;
increases in production over the short and medium term. Moreover, the&#13;
strategy would not be constrained by availability of irrigable land and water&#13;
during this decade. GOB, with donor support, is therefore pursuing private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
sector-led minor irrigation expansion as the main pillar of its agricultural&#13;
development strategy for this decade. As part of this strategy, it aims to&#13;
liberalize further the trade and regulatory framework for agricultural inputs&#13;
with a view to allowing a major role for market forces and private&#13;
initiatives. While a lot has been achieved with respect to agricultural&#13;
policy reforms, further action is needed to: (a) remove remaining policy&#13;
bottlenecks (e.g., formal legal actions to make recent reforms in seed policy&#13;
and deregulation of foodgrain marketing permanent are needed to give the&#13;
private sector confidence to invest in these fields); (b) make the&#13;
agricultural credit system work; and (c) improve weak project administration&#13;
and the poor implementation record.&#13;
1.14      The overall strategy has been fairly successful.  However, the&#13;
progress made in the sector has been almost totally the result of increased&#13;
irrigation. Average yields per hectare per season for irrigated and non-&#13;
irrigated production have not increased, indicating the need for increased&#13;
attention to improving agricultural extension and research programs. The&#13;
increase in rice production means that Bangladesh may soon have a new problem&#13;
of dealing with surplus rice in years of good weather. This requires a&#13;
substantial change in the thinking of the Government and the donor community,&#13;
with increased emphasis either on policies for encouraging crop&#13;
diversification or for the possibly more difficult task of improving a portion&#13;
of the crop to exportable quality. Nevertheless, given continued rapid&#13;
population growth (which has been reduced somewhat to 2.2t per annum) and&#13;
severe shortage of cultivable land, Bangladesh must continue substantial&#13;
efforts to accelerate agricultural growth to keep ahead of the population&#13;
growth. Moreover, with 601 of the labor force still engaged in agriculture,&#13;
any strategy for economic growth and poverty alleviation must include&#13;
continued increases in the productivity of the agricultural sector.&#13;
C. IDA's Involvement in Agricultural DeveloDment&#13;
1.15      IDA has been involved in Bangladesh's agricultural sector for many&#13;
years. The involvement has been in the form of lending operations, sector&#13;
work and special studies, policy dialogue, and coordination of donor&#13;
activities in the sector. The lending program for Bangladesh has emphasized&#13;
agriculture, especially deve] )ing water resources, strengthening agricultural&#13;
support services, and developing complementary infrastructure. Sector work&#13;
and special studies have been used by IDA as the basis for the lending program&#13;
and policy dialogue with GOB. IDA has also been working closely with the aid&#13;
community to encourage consistency of approach and avoid duplication of&#13;
effort.&#13;
1.16      Consistent with GOB's priorities, increased food production,&#13;
especially rice, has been the main target of IDA's lending in agriculture with&#13;
emphasis given to minor irrigation development and flood control and drainage.&#13;
IDA is also assisting in the exploitation of the yet unexploited potential&#13;
that Bangladesh has in the fisheries subsector. Given that fuel shortage and&#13;
population pressure are encouraging encroachment on forests, IDA is also&#13;
playing an important role in preserving forests through its lending program,&#13;
e.g., financing agro-forestry activities. In addition, IDA is financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
support services (e.g., research and extension) and technical assistance&#13;
(e.g., in flood control). Ongoing IDA-supported agricultural projects&#13;
include: Small Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation II (Cr. 1870-BD),&#13;
BWDB Systems Rehabilitation (Cr. 2099-BD), Third Fisheries (Cr. 2146-BD),&#13;
Agricultural Support Services (Cr. 2233-BD), National Minor Irrigation&#13;
Development (Cr. 2246-BD), and Forest Resources Management (Cr. 2397-BD). A&#13;
major theme in Bangladesh's agenda for encouraging sector development is&#13;
expansion of private sector services to enhance efficiency. IDA has used its&#13;
lending program to promote policy reforms in this direction. For example, in&#13;
close collaboration with the Asian Development Bank, IDA assisted GOB in 1991&#13;
to develop a list of investments and input requirements linked to an action&#13;
program for policy and institutional reforms. IDA supported this package&#13;
through three projects: Shallow Tubewells and Low Lift Pumps (Cr. 2253-BD,&#13;
now closed), National Minor Irrigation Development and Agricultural Support&#13;
Services. IDA has also been coordinating an international effort aimed at&#13;
formulating a plan to improve Bangladesh's ability to deal with flood hazards.&#13;
This included coordinating the work of a panel of experts assigned to oversee&#13;
the implementation of a series of studies and pilot projects which will&#13;
recommend an appropriate Flood Action Plan (FAP). As this work draws to a&#13;
close at the end of 1995, IDA is assisting GOB in developing permanent&#13;
institutions for improved water sector planning, preserving the institutional&#13;
capacity developed under FAP and making multi-disciplinary planning approaches&#13;
part of Bangladesh's normal water sector planning procedures.&#13;
1.17      The proposed project is part of IDA's efforts to improve&#13;
Bangladesh's ability to deal with flood hazards, but reflects the unique&#13;
characteristics of the project area. The problems of saline intrusion affect&#13;
only a small portion of the country, and the opportunities for similar yield&#13;
increases through keeping out saline water are limited. The high rates of&#13;
return available for certain project investments also reflect the inherent&#13;
advantages of a rehabilitation project, able to take advantage of the sunk&#13;
costs of prior investments. However, the opportunities for similar coastal&#13;
embankments to protect newly accreted lands are well worth studying as part of&#13;
the longer term post-FAP water sector planning activities described above.&#13;
While the proposed project as a whole can be justified based upon its&#13;
quantifiable agricultural production benefits, there are significant non-&#13;
quantifiable benefits in the savings of human lives during future cyclones.&#13;
Therefore, this project should not be considered solely in terms of IDA's&#13;
agricultural sector strategy.&#13;
D. Institutions Involved in the Prolect&#13;
1.18      Two institutions, Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and&#13;
Forest Department (FD), are involved in the preparation and implementation of&#13;
the project.&#13;
Bangladesh Water DeveloDment Board&#13;
1.19      BWDB was established in 1972, when the former East Pakistan Water&#13;
and Power Development Authority (EPWAPDA) was reorganized into two separate&#13;
agencies -- the BWDB and the Power Development Board (PDB). Under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
supervision of the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR), BWDB's mandate is to&#13;
plan, construct, operate and maintain projects for surface water irrigation,&#13;
flood control, and drainage, including town protection and river training,&#13;
throughout the country. It is also responsible for operating and maintaining&#13;
about 400 completed projects ranging in size from small single-structure&#13;
schemes to large multipurpose flood control, drainage, and irrigation&#13;
projects. Its main sources of funding are: (a) GOB's Development Budget for&#13;
the construction of new projects and rehabilitation of a large number of&#13;
existing schemes; (b) the Revenue Budget for operation and maintenance (O&amp;M)&#13;
of completed projects (including an allocation for debt service, taxes and&#13;
arrears); and (c) the Food for Work Programme (FFW) with an allocation of&#13;
wheat utilized for the repair and maintenance of existing projects, and for&#13;
the construction of new schemes. Since 1972 IDA has supported BWDB's program&#13;
with 15 credits, totalling about US$440 million for 11 new projects and four&#13;
flood rehabilitation operations.&#13;
1.20      BWDB is managed by a six member Board comprising a Chairman, and&#13;
five Members for Planning, Implementation, Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M),&#13;
Administration, and Finance, respectively. The headquarters organization is&#13;
primarily responsible for administration, finance, planning and design while&#13;
construction and O&amp;M are the responsibility of the field organization. BWDB&#13;
has about 16,300 staff, of whom about 1,500 are Class I managers, engineers,&#13;
and administrators, and about 14,800 are Class II, III and IV middle and lower&#13;
level technical and support staff. About one third of BWDB employees are&#13;
assigned to O&amp;M. However, these staff have also been responsible for&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of small projects.&#13;
1.21      Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) prepared for five&#13;
completed IDA-financed BWDB projectsl indicate that three have been&#13;
successful, one project (the Barisal Irrigation Project) has not reached its&#13;
full potential, and one (Drainage and Flood Control I) is questionable. For&#13;
the Drainage Project, the PPAR indicated that the assumption that incremental&#13;
dry season production would not have taken place in the absence of the flood&#13;
control embankment "has not yet been substantiated with appropriate impact&#13;
studies." However, the PPAR also noted that the largest of the project's&#13;
investments included significant non-quantifiable benefits of protecting&#13;
population from periodic flooding. (It should be noted that the benefits of&#13;
the proposed project, providing protection from saline high tide inundation&#13;
and reduction in damage from cyclones, are different from the more typical&#13;
inland flood control projects.) All the completed projects experienced&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
serious construction delays. On average, it took about eight years to&#13;
complete the schemes instead of five years as originally planned. Projects&#13;
currently under construction and those more recently completed experienced&#13;
similar delays, most of which occur at the pre-construction stage. There have&#13;
been significant delays due to time consuming administrative procedures for&#13;
appointing consultants to prepare feasibility studies and designs. Procedures&#13;
for acquiring land for construction have been long and complicated and actual&#13;
acquisition of land often has been delayed because of shortage of local funds.&#13;
Delays have occurred during the construction stage due to procurement&#13;
problems, insufficient budget allocations, or delays in release of funds.&#13;
Poor quality of construction due to inadequate supervision of works by BWDB&#13;
staff and use of inexperienced local contractors was a major problem in the&#13;
past. In recent years, BWDB has employed local consultants on several&#13;
projects to monitor construction works and help maintain quality standards.&#13;
Quality of works has improved but there is still room for significant further&#13;
improvement. There has also been improvement in the funding allocations for&#13;
the IDA-assisted BWDB projects, which have benefitted from dialogue in&#13;
connection with the Public Resource Management Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2361-&#13;
BD).&#13;
1.22      Potential benefits of past investments in BWDB's projects have not&#13;
been fully realized due to weaknesses in O&amp;M resulting in deterioration of the&#13;
systems. The underlying reasons for these weaknesses include: (a) inadequate&#13;
budget allocations; (b) inefficient use of available funds; (c) deficiencies&#13;
in BWDB's organizational arrangements, procedures and staff capabilities for&#13;
O&amp;M; and (d) insufficient farmer participation. Actions to resolve these&#13;
issues have been agreed under the BWDB Systems Rehabilitation Project (SRP)&#13;
(Cr. 2099-BD). Of particular importance are agreements for increasing&#13;
budgetary allocations for O&amp;M, improvements in BWDB's organization for O&amp;M,&#13;
training programs for BWDB staff and beneficiaries, and measures to increase&#13;
beneficiary participation in financing irrigation O&amp;M activities. While there&#13;
have been some notable improvements (expenditures on maintenance doubled from&#13;
FY89 to FY94), progress on institutional issues has been less than expected.&#13;
However, recent steps, such as the approval in August 1994 of Guidelines for&#13;
Peoples' Participation in Water Development Projects, the assignment of staff&#13;
to implement these Guidelines, and the development of a training program for&#13;
such staff, appear to indicate renewed commitment to addressing the key issues&#13;
in this field.&#13;
1.23      Since mid-1994 substantial progress has been made on long-standing&#13;
institutional issues affecting BWDB. Permanent members have been appointed to&#13;
BWDB's Board (previously staffed largely through "acting" assignments) and the&#13;
Board's original mandate and authority as an autonomous body has been&#13;
restored. Acting upon this renewed authority, the Board filled all vacant&#13;
Chief Engineer positions and delegated increased authority to lower levels of&#13;
BWDB staff to permit project managers to expedite project procurement and&#13;
expenditure decisions. A new accounting system, designed to make BWDB's&#13;
financial transactions more transparent, has now been introduced. (The new&#13;
accounting system had been designed in 1990 by consultants financed by the&#13;
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) as part of co-financing the&#13;
Second Small-Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation Project (Cr. 1870-&#13;
BD). However, implementation of the new system had been resisted until mid-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
1994). As noted above, Guidelines for Peoples' Participation have been&#13;
approved, and are being implemented. Finally, BWDB established five task&#13;
forces on institutional reform, whose recommendations provided the basis for&#13;
reaching agreement with IDA in September 1994 on a short-term BWDB reform&#13;
program. This program concentrated on what could be accomplished over the&#13;
following year, without altering the current allocation of responsibilities&#13;
between BWDB and other institutions. The reform program included measures&#13;
affecting all aspects of BWDB activities, including implementation, O&amp;M,&#13;
accounting, planning, and administration. Key measures, beyond those&#13;
indicated above, include a phased program to separate staff and&#13;
responsibilities for O&amp;M and construction in order to focus a portion of the&#13;
staff on O&amp;M, reforms in personnel planning, evaluation, and promotion&#13;
policies, and introduction of multi-disciplinary project planning teams.&#13;
Progress to-date in implementing the reform program is on schedule.&#13;
1.24      The reform program concentrates mainly on BWDB and leaves issues&#13;
involving other institutions in the water sector for further analysis.&#13;
However, the program includes agreement to undertake studies on such issues,&#13;
including appropriate institutional arrangements for sector analysis, project&#13;
evaluation and planning, and mechanisms for decentralization of responsibility&#13;
and increasing peoples' participation in project formulation and O&amp;M. The FAP&#13;
reports' institutional recommendations include a merger of the temporary&#13;
organization established for FAP with an existing, but weak, sectoral planning&#13;
organization. Under the proposed River Bank Protection Project (RBPP), IDA&#13;
expects to finance technical assistance to improve sectoral planning capacity&#13;
(see para 1.16) and carry-out the above referred medium-term studies.&#13;
1.25      The proposed project design addresses some of the problems&#13;
described above, inter alia, through requiring the use of experienced,&#13;
internationally recruited consultants for supervision of works, using&#13;
prequalified contractors selected through ICB procedures for the major civil&#13;
works, using "Class A" contractors (or the equivalent) and agreed minimum&#13;
contract sizes for the minor works, and incorporating community participation&#13;
and other measures designed to improve maintenance of project works.&#13;
Forest Deoartment&#13;
1.26      Formerly part of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Forest Department&#13;
(FD) is now under Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) which was&#13;
established in 1989. MOEF is in the process of being fully established, but&#13;
is still weak, especially in the areas of monitoring and evaluating the&#13;
operations of its executing agencies, interagency coordination, and resolution&#13;
with other ministries of important intersectoral issues, including land&#13;
allocation, wood prices, and human resource development.&#13;
1.27      FD, headed by a Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF), is the primary&#13;
GOB agency responsible for the day-to-day management of forest resources in&#13;
the country. At its headquarters, the CCF is assisted by three Deputy Chief&#13;
Conservators of Forests (DCCF), responsible for development planning, forest&#13;
extension, and forest management planning, respectively. Each DCCF is&#13;
supported by an Assistant Chief Conservator of Forests (ACCF). Reporting to&#13;
the CCF is also a Conservator of Forests (CF), who with the assistance of two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
ACCFs, is responsible for general administration and wildlife. Also, the&#13;
Directors of both FD's Forest Development and Training Center and the Thana&#13;
Afforestation and Nursery Development Project are directly responsible to the&#13;
CCF.&#13;
1.28      FD's field operations, consisting of six Circles headed by CFs and&#13;
concerned with territorial forestry, also come under the CCF's direction. The&#13;
CF of each Circle is in charge of several forest divisions, which are normally&#13;
within the boundary of an administrative district, and under the charge of a&#13;
Divisional Forest Officer (DFO). There are 37 forest divisions including one&#13;
covering the National Botanical Garden. The divisions are divided into&#13;
several forest ranges which are controlled by Forest Range Officers, who in&#13;
turn are in charge of several beats, each under a Deputy Ranger or Forester.&#13;
The field staff is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of&#13;
plantations, supervision of state forest lands, provision of industrial wood&#13;
supplies and extension and public relations at the local level.&#13;
1.29      FD's total staff is close to 10,000 including about 4,850&#13;
professional and technical staff by the end of 1991. In addition, FD employs&#13;
a labor force of about 500,000 staff-days/year. The FD has long been a&#13;
traditional administration-based organization with accountability focussing&#13;
mainly on adherence to budgetary allocations.  Because work quality and&#13;
effectiveness are not systematically measured, the performance of FD's field&#13;
staff varies widely. The organization was not sufficiently developed along&#13;
functional lines, with inadequate specialization of staff. Headquarters'&#13;
capacity for planning, programming, monitoring and evaluating, and&#13;
environmental management has been weak. Promotion within FD is almost purely&#13;
based on seniority with very little attention to merit and managerial and&#13;
technical capacity. Top managers, especially CCFs, are frequently promoted to&#13;
their post shortly before retirement, reducing their interest in policy and&#13;
institutional reform. FD has furthermore been slow to introduce people-&#13;
oriented forestry development, which, in view of the country's extreme&#13;
population pressure, is crucial for the establishment, protection, and&#13;
utilization of forests. While a change in attitude towards people's&#13;
participation is already evident, clear policies, institutional changes and&#13;
suitable programs are yet to be developed. Some of these issues are being&#13;
addressed under the Forest Resources Management Project (Cr. 2397-BD, approved&#13;
June 1992). In particular, the organization of FD has recently been reshaped&#13;
along functional lines, in accordance with a revised organizational structure&#13;
agreed under the credit. However, it would take some time for the new&#13;
organizational arrangements to affect long-established administrative&#13;
practices.&#13;
1.30      Despite the weaknesses noted above, the overall experience with the&#13;
two prior IDA-assisted forestry projects has been good. The Mangrove&#13;
Afforestation Project (Cr. 1042-BD, approved in 1980) achieved an 18% economic&#13;
rate of return and established over 30,000 ha of new mangrove plantations.&#13;
The Second Forestry Project (Cr. 1634-ED, approved in November 1985) closed in&#13;
June 1992, one year later than originally scheduled. Provisions for&#13;
establishment of 40,000 ha of new mangrove plantations, establishment of&#13;
23,000 ha of industrial plantations and maintenance of mangrove plantations&#13;
have shown good progress. Progress was behind expectation, however, on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
components for thinning industrial plantations, improving the forestry data&#13;
base, and improving in-service training of FD personnel. IDA assistance to&#13;
the forestry sector continues under the Forest Resources Management Project,&#13;
which became operational in 1992. This project supports a seven-year&#13;
comprehensive forestry development program. After a considerable delay in&#13;
procuring technical assistance and contracting for new aerial photographs, the&#13;
performance of the project at present is generally satisfactory. However,&#13;
there are still some policy and institutional reform issues concerning which&#13;
discussions with the Government are continuing. In addition to IDA-financed&#13;
projects, FD has undertaken a number of ongoing pilot operations in community&#13;
participation in forestry, including projects on private and public wastelands&#13;
and the slopes of railway and road rights-of-way. These projects have&#13;
involved several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and have been assisted&#13;
by such external agencies as ADB and WFP. The proposed project takes&#13;
advantage of some of the community participation models developed in the&#13;
inland areas, combined with FD experience in saline tolerant mangrove&#13;
plantation in the coastal areas.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Proiect Objectives and Concept&#13;
Obiectives&#13;
2.1       The objectives of the proposed project are:  (a) cyclone&#13;
protection, including improving the security of persons living in the&#13;
protected areas, reducing damage to houses and other buildings and&#13;
infrastructure and minimizing the loss of crops and livestock; (b) improved&#13;
agricultural production, through preventing saline inundation during normal&#13;
weather and improved cropping patterns due to reduced cyclone risks; and&#13;
(c) introduction of improved technology in the design and construction of&#13;
protection works, and improved methods of embankment maintenance.&#13;
Project Concept&#13;
2.2       The proposed project was originally intended to finance the Mid-&#13;
Term Program to strengthen existing coastal embankments, while a second-stage&#13;
long-term program was being developed for the construction of embankments and&#13;
associated structures for the protection of newly accreted lands. In response&#13;
to the April 1991 cyclone, a portion of the originally intended project has&#13;
been financed separately under the PWP (see para 1.4) to provide for the most&#13;
urgently needed embankment repair and rehabilitation work. However, the PWP&#13;
works are still conceptually part of the Mid-Term Program for coastal&#13;
embankment restoration. The proposed project would finance in addition to the&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement of 12 sea-facing embankments, ancillary&#13;
investments for improved O&amp;M, afforestation, and minor polder improvements&#13;
covering the ten PWP embankments as well as the 12 embankments referred to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
above.2 It would also finance small amounts of work required to complete the&#13;
PWP embankments in one polder where there had been delays due to disputes&#13;
concerning the alignment and in another where improvements in drainage are&#13;
required. For reasonable economy in construction, designs for embankments to&#13;
protect agricultural land allow for moderate overtopping of embankments during&#13;
severe cyclones, but not to a degree which would lead to breaching of the&#13;
embankments or to very high flood levels in the polders. Adequate drainage is&#13;
also to be provided. Afforestation is provided both to help absorb wave&#13;
energy and tidal surges during cyclones and to reduce embankment maintenance&#13;
costs. A community participation approach is to be employed for afforestation&#13;
and routine embankment maintenance.&#13;
B. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.3       In light of IDA's past efforts in assisting Bangladesh to develop&#13;
programs for dealing with the issue of recurrent cyclones, GOB requested IDA&#13;
to coordinate donor assistance following the April 1991 cyclone. IDA agreed&#13;
and assembled the financing package for the PWP (para 1.4). The proposed&#13;
project would extend the PWP program to additional areas, as well as provide&#13;
investments to complement those financed under the PWP. The project should&#13;
also enable IDA to maintain the ongoing dialogue with GOB on appropriate&#13;
disaster control policies and institutional support. Finally, the proposed&#13;
project would protect past and ongoing IDA investments in the coastal belt,&#13;
specifically the Coastal Area Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 339-BD) completed in&#13;
1980, Flood Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1587-BD) completed in 1986, which&#13;
included repair of damages caused by the May 1985 cyclone; Second Flood&#13;
Rehabilitation (Cr. 1876-BD) completed in 1989, which included repair of&#13;
damage during the 1987 floods; and the ongoing Second Small Scale Flood&#13;
Control and Drainage Project (Cr. 1870-BD). A revised Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) is scheduled to be presented at the same time as this&#13;
operation. The CAS emphasizes, inter alia, the importance of agricultural&#13;
growth, development of rural infrastructure, and the need to reduce the&#13;
negative impact of flooding on people's lives and livelihood.&#13;
C. Prolect Components&#13;
2.4       The project includes the following components:&#13;
(a) rehabilitation and improvements to 12 sea-facing empbankments, plus&#13;
small amounts to complete similar works in two polders of the PWP&#13;
program;&#13;
(b) minor rehabilitation and improvements to the non-coastal sections&#13;
of the polders in the Mid-Term Program, including re-excavation of&#13;
drainage canals (khals), repair or replacement of&#13;
2.    There is a total of 21 polders, since the sea-facing embankments of one&#13;
polder are financed partially under PWP and partially under this&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
regulators/surface sluices or minor embankment repairs where&#13;
appropriate to assure agricultural benefits;&#13;
(c)  afforestation of embankment slopes and a strip of 50 to 200 meters&#13;
of foreshore to reduce cyclone damage and embankment maintenance&#13;
costs;&#13;
(d) improved O&amp;M of all polders in the Mid-Term Program;&#13;
(e) a program for compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement of&#13;
people displaced by the project;&#13;
(f) environmental monitoring and provision for appropriate mitigating&#13;
measures;&#13;
(g) studies to investigate the possibility of cost-effective town&#13;
protection works for Sandwip;&#13;
(h) technical assistance for implementation support for components (a)&#13;
through (g) above, and for coordination between the project and&#13;
other projects in the area supporting increased agricultural&#13;
production, and NGO activities to organize and support community&#13;
participation in afforestation and maintenance of embankments;&#13;
(i) training of staff of implementing agencies and participating NGOs,&#13;
and for community participants; and&#13;
(j) vehicles and minor equipment required for GOB supervision of&#13;
proiect implementation, and for afforestation.&#13;
In addition the EC grant supporting this project includes a Community&#13;
Development Fund to enable NGOs to implement such poverty alleviation&#13;
activities complementary to the Project as may be agreed between GOB and EC.&#13;
The proposed project would be implemented over a seven year period beginning&#13;
in late 1995 or early 1996.&#13;
2.5       A community participation approach would be used for dealing with&#13;
the issues of afforestation, routine embankment maintenance, and resettlement&#13;
of families displaced by project works (predominantly squatters on the&#13;
sections of the embankment rehabilitated under the project). NGOs would be&#13;
employed to assist in mobilizing the community, provide training of&#13;
participants and facilitate community implementation of these project&#13;
activities. The project design, including embankment parameters, use of&#13;
afforestation and community participation in maintenance, reflects the results&#13;
of studies to determine a cost-effective design with reduced maintenance&#13;
costs.&#13;

D. Proiect Area&#13;
2.6       The polders (Annex 2) covered in the project are spread over the&#13;
coastal belt surrounding the Bay of Bengal, from Teknaf on the southeast tip&#13;
of Bangladesh to Sharankhola at the southeast border of Bagerhat District. Of&#13;
the 21 polders covered in the project, 18 are in the southeastern part of the&#13;
country and 3 are in the southwest. The number of inhabitants in the project&#13;
area is about 1.2 million or about 200,000 households. About 70% are farmers.&#13;
The gross area is about 240,000 ha of which about 80% is under cultivation.&#13;
Agricultural productivity is low due to salinity and threat of cyclones.&#13;
Industrial activity is concentrated in the Chittagong area (included in the&#13;
PWP).&#13;
E. Detailed Features&#13;
Rehabilitation and ImDrovement Works&#13;
2.7       Maior Civil Works (base cost US$35.1 million).  The civil works&#13;
program would include: (a) major resectioning and/or retirement of embankments&#13;
(including resectioning of about 78 km of embankments and about 73 km of new&#13;
retired embankments) in areas where protection of embankments at the existing&#13;
locations is technically or economically not feasible; (b) about 7 km of new&#13;
or repaired protection works in the form of block revetments to protect&#13;
embankment slopes against damage due to cyclonic storms; (c) replacement or&#13;
repair of existing drainage structures (regulators or drainage sluices); and&#13;
(d) new drainage structures. The above program includes about US$3.4 million&#13;
of works to complete the PWP embankments. It also includes about US$2 million&#13;
of works, to be designed during the first year of project implementation, to&#13;
deal with recent erosion in a 6 km portion of one of the polders (Sandwip).&#13;
All works under this category would be carried out on contracts awarded&#13;
following ICB procedures.&#13;
2.8       Armored embankments for protection of agricultural land and the&#13;
population living in the protected area are not economically feasible or&#13;
justifiable. Therefore, a cost-effective design with lower maintenance cost&#13;
is adopted in the project. The sea-facing embankments are designed as&#13;
compacted earthfill dams with a protective layer of a meter of clay cover&#13;
along the outer slopes and crest, slopes of 1 on 7 on the sea-facing side and&#13;
1 on 3 on the country side, a 50 meter to 200 meter wide strip of foreshore&#13;
afforestation and a crest level established according to the following&#13;
criteria: for normal monsoons and cyclones of the intensity expected once in&#13;
five years, no significant overtopping would occur; for more severe cyclonic&#13;
storms expected once in 20 years, wave overtopping should not result in an&#13;
average water depth in the polder exceeding 1 meter; and for storms of the&#13;
intensity expected once in 40 years, crest level should not be lower than the&#13;
still water level. (For the Chittagong industrial areas financed under the&#13;
PWP, the design criteria used provide for no significant overtopping, even for&#13;
storms expected only once in 40 years). With these design criteria and&#13;
particularly the clay layer, the flatter slopes and the protection afforded by&#13;
afforestation and forest cover of the slopes, annual erosion of earthfill&#13;
would be limited to about 900 m3 per km. A very limited quantity of armored&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
protection is provided in places where retirement is not possible and no&#13;
foreshore area is available for afforestation. In such areas, revetment&#13;
blocks of sufficient weight and thickness and placed on geotextile filters are&#13;
provided. The regulators and surface sluices are designed according to BWDB&#13;
design criteria.&#13;
2.9       Minor Civil Works (base cost US$9.5 million).  The civil works&#13;
program would include: (a) minor embankment repairs mainly on the non-coastal&#13;
sections including any minor repairs to the sea-facing sections;3 (b) re-&#13;
excavation of the drainage network within the protected area and the outfall&#13;
canals; (c) minor repairs to existing revetment works; (d) repair or&#13;
replacement of drainage regulators in areas not included in the program of&#13;
coastal embankment repairs; (e) new surface sluices to drain isolated drainage&#13;
congested pockets within the protected area; and (f) surveying and&#13;
investigations limited to minor civil works. The slopes and crest width of&#13;
interior and marginal embankments of the minor works program would conform to&#13;
the Coastal Embankment Project design criteria, prepared by Leedshill-DeLeuw&#13;
Engineers and approved by BWDB. Crest levels would conform to the design&#13;
criteria of the major civil works. Works other than re-excavation of drainage&#13;
canals would be carried out on contracts awarded following NCB procedures.&#13;
Re-excavation of khals (base cost US$3.1 million) are expected to be carried&#13;
out under the Food For Work (FFW) program.&#13;
2.10      BWDB Engineering and Administration (base cost US$2.7 million).&#13;
Project costs include provision for BWDB engineering and administrative costs&#13;
directly related to the implementation of rehabilitation and improvement&#13;
works. The provision is estimated at 5% and 10% of the investment costs of&#13;
major and minor civil works respectively.&#13;
Afforestation (base cost US$5.3 million, plus US$1.8 million for leasing&#13;
private foreshore land)&#13;
2.11      The afforestation program includes: the development of forestry&#13;
models, nursery development and planting of appropriate species of trees and&#13;
shrubs on the embankment slopes and a 50 to 200 meter wide strip of forest on&#13;
the foreshore. This program forms an integral part of the embankment design.&#13;
The afforestation program covers about 1,900 ha of embankment and about 4,700&#13;
ha of foreshore development. The component would be implemented on a&#13;
community participation basis. FD would be directly responsible for the&#13;
foreshore afforestation component and would provide assistance to BWDB for the&#13;
embankmnent afforestation component. An agreement has been signed between BWDB&#13;
and FD, satisfactory to IDA, setting forth specific responsibilities and&#13;
arrangements for coordination. It was agreed at negotiations that maintenance&#13;
of such an agreement, satisfactory to IDA, would continue until Proiect&#13;
completion. NGOs active in the respective project areas would be employed to&#13;
mobilize the local people to participate in the project and provide training&#13;
in planting and maintenance of trees. FD would provide necessary technical&#13;
training to NGO staff, and possibly directly to community participants, and&#13;
3.    For one polder (Sonagazi) where only 2 km of sea-facing embankment&#13;
requires repair, this work is included in the minor works program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
technical supervision of forestry activities. In areas where private sector&#13;
produced seedlings of non-mangrove species are available and of suitable&#13;
quality, advantage would be taken of such availability. This is estimated to&#13;
cover about 30% of non-mangrove species. For the remainder, FD would have&#13;
overall responsibility for nursery operation and provision of seedlings. FD&#13;
would directly operate the nurseries for mangrove species and provide&#13;
technical supervision and funding support for establishment of NGO-operated&#13;
nurseries for the non-mangrove species. FD staff would also provide technical&#13;
assistance, if requested, for the private sector nurseries.&#13;
2.12      Squatters and those made landless by land acquisition and other&#13;
landless people (to the extent of available space) would be resettled at the&#13;
toe of the embankment on the countryside and allocated a homestead plot of&#13;
10 m by 20 m and an area of the embankment of about 1 ha.4 for each family.&#13;
Such settlers would be given long-term contracts (of the order of 15 to 30&#13;
years) allowing them to reside on this allotment and obtain the produce of&#13;
appropriate tree species planted in return for providing routine maintenance&#13;
of their section of the embankment and carrying out and maintaining an&#13;
afforestation program for their part of the embankment. NGOs would be&#13;
employed to help organize this process, while FD would provide technical&#13;
guidance and quality control for the embankment afforestation operations.&#13;
Such families would be paid a subsistence income for about four years until&#13;
the trees on the embankment produce sufficient income, but the payments would&#13;
decrease as the income from the trees increases. Participants would be paid&#13;
on a periodic schedule, based upon NGO certification that the embankment&#13;
maintenance and afforestation activities were adequately performed in&#13;
accordance with project requirements. NGOs would also supply participants&#13;
with fertilizer and pesticides for the first three years. The declining scale&#13;
of payments to be specified in the settlers' lease agreements has been set to&#13;
ensure that such payments, when added to the increasing income from the&#13;
homestead and the afforested embankment, would produce an adequate incentive&#13;
to cover both routine embankment maintenance and afforestation activities.&#13;
NGOs would monitor actual earnings from embankment afforestation and homestead&#13;
cultivation. In case of major disruptions in a polder from the assumed&#13;
afforestation program, which may occur due to significant storm damage or a&#13;
disease outbreak, NGOs would recommend appropriate adjustments in the agreed&#13;
4.    For two polders (out of the 21 in the project) there are too many&#13;
squatter families for the normal pattern to work. In portions of these&#13;
polders a variation of the arrangements described above for squatter&#13;
resettlement and embankment afforestation and maintenance would have to&#13;
be used. Groups would be organized to take responsibility for&#13;
embankment afforestation and maintenance, with each family responsible&#13;
for the maintenance and receiving the benefit of the produce of the&#13;
trees for a much smaller section of the embankment than in the standard&#13;
model (perhaps 1/4 to 1/8 ha). This would not be expected to provide&#13;
subsistence income but (together with the produce from the homestead&#13;
plot) would supplement whatever sources of income had been maintaining&#13;
the families up until now. In portions of the two polders, a&#13;
continuous berm would be constructed at the countryside toe of the&#13;
embankment for squatter resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
scale of payments to the settlers. FD and BWDB would provide periodic quality&#13;
control checking, on a sample basis, of afforestation and embankment&#13;
maintenance activities respectively. The contracts with the settlers would&#13;
provide for an increasing scale of penalties for families who do not&#13;
adequately perform these duties, ranging from non-payment of cash income&#13;
through revoking the right to the produce from embankment afforestation, with&#13;
the possibility of eviction as a last resort if all other sanctions fail.&#13;
NGOs would recommend to BWDB appropriate sanctions, when necessary. (For&#13;
additional details see Annex 3). Model lease agreements with settlers were&#13;
agreed at negotiations.&#13;
2.13      Community groups organized by NGOs under FD supervision would be&#13;
responsible for the foreshore afforestation on publicly owned land. They&#13;
would be paid for their planting activities. Thereafter Landless Contracting&#13;
Societies (LCS) would be granted contracts under which they would share 2/3 of&#13;
the income from the trees in return for their handling of minimal maintenance&#13;
activities, guarding of the trees against poachers, harvesting, and replanting&#13;
of harvested areas. The remaining 1/3 of the income would go to the Union&#13;
Parishad for financing of local investments. Models of such agreements were&#13;
agreed at negotiations. An order has been issued allocating appropriate&#13;
publicly owned land for foreshore afforestation purposes. In areas where the&#13;
foreshore is privately owned, FD would hire community groups, organized and&#13;
supervised by NGOs, to plant the seedlings at no charge to the landowners, in&#13;
return for the landowners' agreement to maintain the area under trees. The&#13;
agreement with private owners of foreshore land would also provide that&#13;
landowners would receive in the case of any land not yet too saline for crop&#13;
production, the estimated value of the net income from foregone crop&#13;
production until income from the trees is available (about 8 years). The&#13;
agreement would permit landowners to use forest products according to sound&#13;
forestry practices, with the landowner obligated to replant trees in areas of&#13;
harvesting. Models of such agreements were agreed at negotiations. Foreshore&#13;
afforestation development is based on the premise that land would not require&#13;
acquisition. This is a realistic assumption as most of the foreshore is&#13;
public land and where the foreshore is privately owned, areas can be selected&#13;
which are relatively unproductive due to high salinity levels. (In only about&#13;
1,000 ha out of about 4,700 ha planned for foreshore afforestation are crops&#13;
currently grown.) In addition, after the recent cyclones, communities now&#13;
appreciate the importance of the coastal embankments in saving their lives and&#13;
property. The locally elected officials of the Union Parishad and influential&#13;
members of the community and the community at large should be able to settle&#13;
any problem of non-cooperation without being forced to resort to land&#13;
acquisition.&#13;
2.14      Models for embankment slope afforestation and foreshore development&#13;
have been prepared. Models for the embankment take account of the need for&#13;
species which are resistant to cyclonic winds and (on the outer slope)&#13;
salinity, have root structures which will strengthen the embankment, and which&#13;
would produce adequate income. Within these constraints, those allotted&#13;
sections of the embankment would be permitted some choice of species in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
response to personal preferences and local market opportunities.5 Options&#13;
for suitable species for foreshore development take into consideration&#13;
variations in soils and tidal conditions. It is estimated that, due to loss&#13;
of trees, an average of two plantings would be required on the foreshore.&#13;
Based on this, it is estimated that about Tk 16,800 per ha would be required&#13;
for afforestation of embankment slopes, Tk 10,700 per ha for foreshore&#13;
afforestation with mangroves and Tk 30,200 per ha for foreshore afforestation&#13;
with upland species. An additional Tk 56.5 million is provided for&#13;
establishment and operation of nurseries. (For details see Annex 4). These&#13;
figures exclude the costs of technical assistance, FD staff and vehicles. The&#13;
subsistence payments to settlers until the trees provide adequate income are&#13;
budgeted under embankment O&amp;M costs. (Annex 4).&#13;
Improved Operation and Maintenance (base cost US$5.4 million)&#13;
2.15      The project would support an improved O&amp;M program for the 21&#13;
polders included under the project. All polder infrastructure, including the&#13;
sea-facing and non-coastal reaches of the embankment, drainage regulators,&#13;
surface sluices and the drainage network would be included in the program. In&#13;
the past, O&amp;M activities were not clearly defined, allocations under the&#13;
recurrent budget were inadequate, BWDB field staff were not sufficiently&#13;
experienced, and the benefiting community was not involved in maintenance&#13;
activities. The severe damage caused by cyclonic storms and river erosion&#13;
aggravated the situation which forced the displaced families whose land had&#13;
been eroded to resettle on the embankment. Cuts on the embankment to&#13;
accommodate houses and cultivation of the slopes with annual crops weakened&#13;
the embankment. In these conditions, no effective system of O&amp;M could be&#13;
carried out. The improved O&amp;M program has been designed taking into&#13;
consideration these issues. The major change is in the maintenance system and&#13;
the involvement of the community in the simple maintenance tasks. Operational&#13;
activities are adequately spelled out and BWDB staff are sufficiently&#13;
experienced to carry out these tasks once the works are rehabilitated and the&#13;
community has been mobilized to handle routine embankment maintenance. The&#13;
improved O&amp;M program would include: (a) routine or preventive maintenance;&#13;
(b) periodic maintenance; and (c) repairs caused by cyclonic storms, monsoon&#13;
floods, and scours to embankment slopes caused by wave action. The project&#13;
provides funds for these activities, including the costs required for&#13;
involvement of the community in the maintenance program. Further details are&#13;
provided in Annex 5.&#13;
2.16      Community involvement is crucial to the sustainability of the&#13;
proposed system. The families resettled on the toe of the embankment (as&#13;
described in para 2.12 above) would be responsible for routine maintenance of&#13;
their allotted section of the embankment. NGOs involved with the&#13;
5.    Hedge rows of vetiver grass would be planted just below the crest of&#13;
the embankment in a small pilot area. Depending upon the results,&#13;
vetiver or other hedge row species would be used in the general model&#13;
along the crest of the embankment. Longer term experiments will&#13;
determine whether the tree canopies allow sufficient light to penetrate&#13;
to permit vetiver to grow on other portions of the embankment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
afforestation component would also help organize the community participation&#13;
in routine embankment maintenance. BWDB would provide technical guidance and&#13;
quality control for the embankment maintenance operations. The income&#13;
payments to the participants have been set on a declining scale over four&#13;
years (taking account of anticipated increases in income from the embankment&#13;
and homestead over this period) to provide adequate incentive (see para 2.12),&#13;
and would cover the routine embankment maintenance responsibilities as well as&#13;
the work in the initial years of planting trees on the embankment. This would&#13;
be budgeted as embankment O&amp;M expenditure (which is financed on a declining&#13;
percentage basis under the proposed credit). However, payment to participants&#13;
would be contingent on NGO certification that both embankment maintenance and&#13;
afforestation responsibilities were being carried out adequately. Routine&#13;
earthwork maintenance on portions of embankments not being rehabilitated under&#13;
the project would be carried out under labor contracts by the community in&#13;
groups of about 25 persons on average, organized by NGOs. Periodic&#13;
maintenance of all earthworks, which would be carried out annually or&#13;
biannually, would be undertaken under labor contracts by the community or by&#13;
small scale contracts awarded following NCB procedures. Controlling&#13;
activities at the structures, presently the responsibility of Khalashis, would&#13;
gradually be transferred to the community. Committees in each Union Parishad&#13;
would be formed to assist in supervising maintenance activities and preventing&#13;
future squatters. BWDB would continue to provide technical supervision and&#13;
financial control of all maintenance activities.&#13;
2.17      Project costs include the routine and periodic maintenance&#13;
activities for polders included in the project. The project would also&#13;
provide for repairs to damages caused by cyclonic storms occurring during the&#13;
project period. (This would include allowance for payments for routine&#13;
maintenance to resume temporarily if the cyclones damaged trees on the&#13;
embankment to the extent that they could no longer provide adequate&#13;
subsistence income.) Repairs to damages due to monsoon floods and embankment&#13;
slope scours would also be included. (Repairs of damages to embankment slopes&#13;
caused by river bank erosion is not included in the Project.) Disbursements&#13;
by IDA for maintenance activities would be on a declining percentage basis.&#13;
The Government agreed to include in its budget annual allocations for&#13;
operation and maintenance of proiect facilities in accordance with a timetable&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. Tentative estimates of annual budgetary requirements for&#13;
O&amp;M were agreed at negotiations, subject to further review based upon&#13;
experience in maintaining these embankments. These estimates cover routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance activities, and repairs following "normal" floods and&#13;
cyclones of an intensity occurring with a frequency of once in five years.&#13;
The O&amp;M budgeting and monitoring procedures being developed in four pilot&#13;
subprojects under the SRP project would be introduced in CERP polders to&#13;
assure adequate provision for routine and periodic O&amp;M.&#13;
Land Acauisition and Resettlement (base cost US$3.3 million for Land&#13;
Acquisition, US$0.4 million for Resettlement)&#13;
2.18      A total of about 675 ha of land would be required for providing&#13;
project facilities. For reconstruction work, about 270 ha are required for&#13;
retirements, about 175 ha are required for widening of existing embankments&#13;
(including paying for land under one existing embankment where the land had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
been previously made available on a voluntary basis, without transfer of&#13;
ownership), about 55 ha are required for structures, and about 35 ha for minor&#13;
works (excluding Khal excavation). For resettlement of embankment squatters&#13;
and other landless people who will participate in embankment O&amp;M and&#13;
afforestation, about 35 ha would be required. For the temporary acquisition&#13;
of spoil dump areas needed for the re-excavation of khals, about 105 ha would&#13;
be required. (Cost of temporary acquisition is estimated at about a third of&#13;
the land value). Acquisition is kept to a minimum by limiting areas to only&#13;
those actually required for the embankment sections being constructed and for&#13;
homestead allotments. Payment of royalty for the fill materials would be the&#13;
responsibility of contractors. According to procedures adopted for the FFW&#13;
program, no provision is made for land acquisition for re-excavation of khals&#13;
except for the spoil dump areas. Takeover of acquired land could be timed in&#13;
most cases after the aman harvest to avoid damage to standing crops.&#13;
2.19      A Resettlement Action Plan acceptable to IDA has been adopted by&#13;
the Government. Agreement was reached during negotiations that resettlement&#13;
and rehabilitation of persons adversely affected by the prolect would be&#13;
carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Resettlement Action Plan.&#13;
About 700 families who are presently squatting on embankment sections to be&#13;
rehabilitated, and about 1300 other landless families would be resettled under&#13;
the project on new homestead plots at the toe of the embankment. The&#13;
embankment squatters on sections being rehabilitated would have to move prior&#13;
to the start of construction. It is expected that most would opt to move&#13;
immediately to new homes at the back of the homestead plots, which would still&#13;
allow contractors enough room on the berm for construction activities.6&#13;
Alternatively, they would be given the option of a rental allowance for about&#13;
a year to cover the costs of temporarily renting a plot or a house for a year&#13;
during construction. During the construction period, such settlers would be&#13;
given priority by FD for employment in the afforestation of the foreshore, to&#13;
the extent that they are not absorbed in project construction activities. The&#13;
above arrangements allow people displaced by the project to remain in their&#13;
communities, a short distance from their previous homes, and to earn income,&#13;
following project construction activities, from the produce of the trees to be&#13;
planted on the embankment. Landowners losing a portion of their property due&#13;
to land acquisition for the project (about 1,800 families) would be given cash&#13;
compensation sufficient to purchase replacement land of similar earning&#13;
capacity, including the value of trees, fish ponds, and other assets. All&#13;
families being resettled (the squatters and about 200 families who would have&#13;
to move their houses to other parts of their property plus the four families&#13;
losing all their property) would receive funds equivalent to the replacement&#13;
costs of the houses being demolished, taking into account the costs for moving&#13;
their homes and household belongings and the cost of new materials for&#13;
rebuilding their homes (deducting the value of salvagable materials). Similar&#13;
compensation for relocation of shops or factories would be provided for about&#13;
22 families. Any landowner receiving compensation less than three months&#13;
6.    About 80 squatter families who will have to relocate during the first&#13;
year of the project will be paid a rental allowance for about a year to&#13;
allow time for acquisition of land for their new homestead plots, plus&#13;
moving costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
prior to eviction would be paid additional compensation to cover estimated&#13;
loss of income until new land or other assets can be purchased. Any farmer&#13;
using non-owned land under arrangements of duration greater than a year would&#13;
also receive compensation for loss of income and any advance payment he had&#13;
made for the land. The timing of takeover of land would be set to minimize&#13;
loss of standing crops. However, anyone losing a standing crop would be&#13;
compensated for the estimated value at harvest. Project costs include the&#13;
cost of relocation of the squatters and those losing their homes due to land&#13;
acquisition as resettlement costs and the costs of other compensation as land&#13;
acquisition costs. Consultants (including NGOs) and vehicles for land&#13;
acquisition purposes are included within the technical assistance and vehicles&#13;
categories. Further details are provided in Annex 9.&#13;
Surveys. Investigations and Studies (base cost US$0.5 million)&#13;
2.20      This category would include (a) surveys required prior to minor&#13;
civil works construction; and (b) studies to investigate the possibility of&#13;
cost-effective town protection works for Sandwip. The surveys under (a) above&#13;
would be carried out by BWDB. The major part of the work under (b) would be&#13;
carried out by the Ministry of Water Resources' River Research Institute, with&#13;
some input from BWDB and the project consultants described in para. 2.21&#13;
below.&#13;
Technical Assistance (base cost US$10.6 million)&#13;
2.21      Technical assistance would be provided for Project support&#13;
(including implementation supervision and assistance) and training. A&#13;
substantial amount is required for project support to ensure effective&#13;
contract management and supervision of civil works, taking account of the&#13;
scattered nature of the construction sites. Prior projects directly&#13;
supervised by BWDB have had problems with construction quality due in part to&#13;
inadequate site supervision staff and lack of proper training in these&#13;
aspects. Proiect support (base cost US$9.6 million) would include:&#13;
(a) contract management and supervision of all major civil works, including&#13;
any inputs for additional designs required during the construction period;&#13;
(b) review of designs of all minor civil works, including making amendments as&#13;
required, and assistance in preparing tender documents, evaluation of bids and&#13;
supervision of construction of such works; (c) technical advice and assistance&#13;
for afforestation development (including pilot operations testing use of&#13;
vetiver on embankments); (d) assistance in planning and introducing effective&#13;
systems for operating and maintaining the completed polders; (e) assistance in&#13;
involving the community in planting of trees under the afforestation program&#13;
and routine embankment maintenance activities; (f) assistance in periodically&#13;
monitoring the physical and social impact of the project, including&#13;
identifying adverse environmental effects and proposing mitigating measures to&#13;
minimize or eliminate these effects; (g) coordination between this project and&#13;
on-going efforts under other GOB and NGO projects in the project area&#13;
(particularly the IDA/ODA supported Agriculture Support Services Project) to&#13;
assist farmers in the project area to take advantage of the opportunities for&#13;
increased production resulting from the project; (h) assistance in&#13;
implementation and monitoring of land acquisition/resettlement; (i) assistance&#13;
to the Sandwip town protection studies referred to in para 2.20(b); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(j) assistance to BWDB during 1995 for pre-construction activities. Item&#13;
(e) above would be carried out largely by NGOs active in the project area.&#13;
Item (h) is likely to be carried out by the local firm which prepared the&#13;
resettlement plan, using NGOs active in individual polders as subcontractors.&#13;
Services for item (j) are being carried out by the PWP consultants and the&#13;
local resettlement plan consultants. The remaining items above (as well as&#13;
provision of some assistance to NGOs involved in item (e) above) would be&#13;
provided by a firm of consultants with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
Consultancy inputs by the main project consultants are estimated at 326 staff&#13;
months of internationally recruited senior specialists, 736 staff months of&#13;
locally recruited senior specialists, 568 staff months of locally recruited&#13;
junior professionals, and 1172 staff months of locally recruited technical&#13;
assistants. In addition, there would be about 140 incremental NGO staff&#13;
participating under the project. Further details of the consultancy and NGO&#13;
arrangements are given in Annexes 6 and 3 respectively, with item (h) above&#13;
covered in Annex 9.  Agreement was reached during negotiations that&#13;
consultants, with terms of reference acceptable to IDA, would be appointed&#13;
prior to siqnature of civil work contracts.  The framework for contracts&#13;
between BWDB and NGOs was agreed during negotiations and agreement reached&#13;
that the BWDB would enter into such contracts with NGOs satisfactory to IDA by&#13;
February 15, 1996.&#13;
2.22      Training (base cost US$1.0 million) would be directed specifically&#13;
at: (a) improving the skills of BWDB subdivisional office staff in&#13;
construction supervision and O&amp;M and in the social aspects of community&#13;
involvement and dealing with displaced people; (b) improving the awareness of&#13;
environmental issues within BWDB (which is intended to have impact on project&#13;
planning and implementation beyond the present project); (c) providing&#13;
training to FD and NGO staff in community development activities, nursery&#13;
development and forestry planting and maintenance, NGO staff in routine&#13;
embankment maintenance, and community participants in afforestation and&#13;
routine embankment maintenance. In addition, the project would include&#13;
continuation of a program initiated under the PWP for training of senior and&#13;
mid-level BWDB staff in all aspects of contract management and supervision.&#13;
The same consulting firm providing implementation support assistance, as&#13;
described in para. 2.21 above, would also be responsible for designing and&#13;
coordinating the training programs and recruiting a team of appropriate local&#13;
trainers. Requirements have been estimated at about 12 consultant months of&#13;
an internationally recruited specialist and 228 consultant months of locally&#13;
recruited senior trainers. Further details on requirements and activities to&#13;
be performed for all project components are given in Annex 7.&#13;
Vehicles and Eciuipment (base cost of procurement US$0.9 million, operating&#13;
costs US$0.4 million)&#13;
2.23      The project would provide vehicles and minor equipment for the use&#13;
of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) (see para 3.1), BWDB field divisions,&#13;
and forestry field staff. Miscellaneous minor equipment such as off-ce and&#13;
drafting equipment, environmental monitoring equipment, and a limited number&#13;
of computers are also provided. It was agreed at negotiations that all&#13;
vehicles and eauipment. other than replacement motorcycles or bicycles for&#13;
field staff, would be Procured by December 31, 2000. The estimated costs for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
the running of such vehicles and equipment are included as part of the&#13;
Government's contribution to the project. Vehicles and equipment to be used&#13;
by the consultants and NGOs are included in the cost estimates for technical&#13;
assistance services.&#13;
Community Development Fund (base cost of US$0.4 million)&#13;
2.24      This Fund is not part of the IDA-financed project but is expected&#13;
to be included in the EC grant and would finance poverty allieviation&#13;
activities complementary to the project. The proposed Community Development&#13;
Fund would provide resources for NGOs to implement poverty alleviation&#13;
activities aimed at strengthening project operations and group cohesion. This&#13;
could involve, for example, water supplies and sanitary facilities for&#13;
embankment settlers, community training and education programs, and income&#13;
generating activities. The latter could in particular aim at processing and&#13;
marketing of project outputs such as coconuts. The fund might also be used to&#13;
provide credit for the purchase of hand tools by community groups engaged in&#13;
embankment maintenance. The fund would be administered by the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU) described in para 3.1. NGOs would submit proposals&#13;
to the PIU for activities to be funded under eligibility criteria agreed&#13;
between GOB and EC. Implementation of approved activities would be the&#13;
responsibility of NGOs contracted for project implementation. The PIU would&#13;
closely monitor activities funded to ensure that they directly support key&#13;
project objectives, and do not divert NGO staff time from the support and&#13;
implementation of afforestation and embankment O&amp;M.&#13;
F. Status of Preparation and Implementation Schedule&#13;
2.25      Preparation.  Detailed designs and tender documents have been&#13;
prepared for the major reconstruction works of the project (other than one&#13;
small contract for completion of a PWP polder and a second to deal with a six&#13;
km section of another polder affected by recent erosion). Prequalified&#13;
contractors were invited in August 1995 to bid for these major works. Review&#13;
of tenders and award of contracts is expected to be completed by January 1996.&#13;
The preliminary designs and estimates for all minor works have been prepared&#13;
by BWDB. It is estimated that by the end of FY96, the project consultants&#13;
could prepare detailed designs and tender documents for all the minor works.&#13;
Proposals and estimates for embankment afforestation and improved O&amp;M&#13;
components have been prepared. Given the pioneering nature of the community&#13;
participation approach for embankment afforestation and a portion of the O&amp;M&#13;
work, provision is being made for two mid-term reviews (see para 3.9) to&#13;
permit adjustments based on experience.&#13;
2.26      Implementation Schedule (Annex 1). The total project&#13;
implementation period would be seven years (FY96-FY02). However,&#13;
implementation after December 31, 2000 would be limited to the afforestation&#13;
and improved O&amp;M components, together with limited inputs for associated&#13;
project support and training, and activities supported by the Community&#13;
Development Fund. Contracts for reconstruction work for most of the sea-&#13;
facing embankments would be awarded following ICB procedures in time to permit&#13;
construction to start in March 1996. Work would be completed in three&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
construction seasons (ending June 1998). The contracts for completion of the&#13;
sea-facing embankment in one of the PWP polders, major structures in another&#13;
PWP polder and works in the section affected by erosion would be tendered a&#13;
year later. Minor civil works would commence in FY97 and be completed within&#13;
a period of five years. The longer implementation period is required due to&#13;
implementation of portions through the FFW program, limited number of local&#13;
contractors able to produce quality work, and utilization of community groups&#13;
for earthworks. It was agreed at neqotiations that the Proposed credit would&#13;
only finance civil works expenditures incurred throucrh December 31. 2000. As&#13;
soon as construction conditions permit, sections of the ermibankment and the&#13;
foreshore would be afforested. It is estimated that the planting of trees&#13;
would commence in FY97 for the PWP embankments and the foreshore, and in FY99&#13;
for the other major work embankments. Initial planting would be substantially&#13;
completed by FY00. (Replanting where required and planting on minor works&#13;
embankments would continue through the end of the project.) Forestry trials&#13;
and pilot schemes on about 40 ha of embankment and 120 ha of foreshore would&#13;
be taken up in FY96. These would produce data useful for successful&#13;
implementation of the afforestation program and the program for community&#13;
participation in embankment maintenance. The embankment maintenance program&#13;
would commence for sections of embankment when contractor's one year defects&#13;
liability period is completed. The schedule for the reconstruction program&#13;
indicates that the maintenance program would start for some embankment&#13;
sections (particularly sections completed under the PWP) by FY96, and that all&#13;
works would be included in the maintenance program during FY01 and FY02.&#13;
Project support and training would commence in FY96 and continue throughout&#13;
the project period, with limited inputs during the last two years.&#13;
G. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.27      The proposed project has been placed in environmental screening&#13;
Category B. Most physical works consist of rehabilitation and improvements of&#13;
existing infrastructure in the polders. The project would improve the&#13;
environmental conditions by providing additional security against cyclone and&#13;
monsoon damage, ensuring that salinity intrusion is controlled, increasing&#13;
forested areas and reducing or eliminating drainage congestion with consequent&#13;
reductions in health hazards. The rehabilitation program would not have&#13;
adverse effects on fisheries, since the polders of the Mid-Term Program have&#13;
no permanent water bodies (beels or haors), and since the embankments do not&#13;
close up major or medium rivers or shoot channels of these rivers which are&#13;
the main routes for migration of fish to the spawning grounds in flood plains.&#13;
Regulator operations on the khals would be designed to facilitate fishing.&#13;
Shrimp inlets have been included where necessary. Freshwater pond fish&#13;
cultivation (dominated by carp) would be benefited by protection from cyclone&#13;
surges and saline intrusion into ponds. The borrow pits inside the&#13;
embankments could also be used to increase pond fish cultivation. There would&#13;
be some increase in the use of fertilizer and pesticide in the project area,&#13;
since the project would enable farmers to switch from local to high yielding&#13;
varieties. However, over-use of fertilizer and pesticides is not generally a&#13;
problem in Bangladesh. Farmer training in proper fertilizer and pesticide use&#13;
is included under the ongoing IDA/ODA financed Agricultural Support Services&#13;
Project (Cr. 2233-BD). The proposed project provides for the resettlement of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
squatters and others who may become landless as a result of land acquisition&#13;
(see paras 2.12 and 2.19). The technical assistance component includes funds&#13;
for monitoring the effects of project works during the implementation period&#13;
and training to increase environmental awareness within BWDB. Financing for&#13;
mitigating measures required to remedy adverse effects would be available&#13;
under the rehabilitation and improvement component. Further details on&#13;
environmental aspects are in Annex 10.&#13;
H. Project Cost&#13;
2.28      The total project cost is estimated at US$87.8 million equivalent,&#13;
with a foreign exchange component of US$26.2 million or about 30% of the total&#13;
cost (Table 2.1). The civil works cost estimates are based on prices obtained&#13;
in 1992 in the tenders for the major civil works under the PWP, adjusted for&#13;
inflation and differences between the proposed Coastal Embankment&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (CERP) and PWP, and results of tenders under other&#13;
ongoing IDA projects. The rates for recent NCB tenders are used for cost&#13;
estimates for the minor civil works. Estimates for quantities are taken from&#13;
the preliminary designs prepared by the PWP consultant and BWDB. The&#13;
estimates for the afforestation program are based on the PWP consultant's&#13;
proposals, FD estimates and an assessment carried out by the appraisal team.&#13;
For O&amp;M, estimates are based on the PWP consultant's proposals with&#13;
adjustments made based on estimates of length of project embankment affected&#13;
by cyclonic storms (to take account of the fact that the non-coastal&#13;
embankments would require less maintenance), and for the cost of declining&#13;
scale payments to families engaged in embankment maintenance and afforestation&#13;
until the income of the produce from trees planted on the embankment is&#13;
sufficient to maintain the family (see para 2.12).&#13;
2.29      The project cost includes US$7.0 million in taxes and duties.&#13;
Physical contingencies are estimated at 15% for major civil works and range&#13;
between 10% and 15% for the minor civil works, depending on the nature of the&#13;
works. Allowance for physical contingencies is not provided for afforestation&#13;
or other goods and services. Price contingencies and foreign exchange rates&#13;
are estimated on the basis of expected rates of local and foreign inflation.&#13;
Local inflation is estimated at rates ranging from 4% to 5% per annum during&#13;
the project period while foreign inflation is estimated at 2.2% per annum.&#13;
I. Prolect Financinq&#13;
2.30      The project would be financed by IDA, EC and GOB.  The IDA Credit&#13;
SDR 34.1 million (US$53.0 million equivalent) would cover about 65% of the&#13;
project cost excluding taxes. IDA would assist in financing investment costs&#13;
for: embankment rehabilitation and improvement works; vehicles and equipment&#13;
for GOB agencies; BWDB engineering and administration costs; surveys and&#13;
studies carried out by GOB staff; and the recurrent costs for improved O&amp;M (at&#13;
a declining percentage). An EC grant of ECU 15 million (US$20.1 million&#13;
equivalent at June 1995 exchange rates) would cover about 25% of the project&#13;
cost excluding taxes, plus the Community Development Fund. EC financing for&#13;
the project would be used to finance afforestation, private foreshore leasing,&#13;

resettlement costs, project support, and training.   The EC grant would include&#13;
"bridge financing" of pre-construction consultant services and pilot forestry&#13;
operations during 1995. Effectiveness of the cofinancinca acqreement between&#13;
GOB and EC would be a condition of credit effectiveness for the IDA Credit.&#13;
GOB would finance the remaining project costs, estimated at US$15.1 million&#13;
equivalent. This includes about US$3.6 million equivalent expected to be&#13;
contributed in the form of foodgrains by WFP to support earthworks for&#13;
bringing the drainage network to the design profile and bed level. The&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
balance of GOB's contribution, US$11.5 million equivalent, including US$7.0&#13;

annual budget appropriations in conformance with the project implementation&#13;
schedule. Aproval of the Project Proforma7 would be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness. Table 2.2 summarizes the project financing plan by component.&#13;

Cost of expected WFP foodgrains are counted as a GOB contribution.&#13;
11.    Other procurement includes routine maintenance work carried out by individual&#13;
families (see para 2.16), maintenance work carried out through community&#13;
participation, and up to US$500,000 for emergency repairs by force account.&#13;

2.32      All major works on the sea-facing embankments, estimated to cost&#13;
$42.0 million equivalent, (involving retired or resectioned embankments or&#13;
block revetment protection works, and repairs or replacements of drainage&#13;
structures in areas of embankment improvement) would be carried out under&#13;
contracts awarded following ICB procedures. In bid evaluations under ICB&#13;
procedures, eligible domestic contractors would receive a preference of 7.5'.&#13;
All of the above works in a polder would be offered as a package. Where such&#13;
a package would be too small to interest international bidding, works in two&#13;
polders would be combined in one package. One large minor works contract for&#13;
3 relatively large structures for Chakoria polder, estimated to cost about&#13;
$1.6 million equivalent, would also be procured through ICB. The other minor&#13;
civil works, estimated to cost $6.4 million equivalent and to average about&#13;
$0.2 million per contract, are relatively small, scattered and located in&#13;
places of difficult access and in addition most are labor-intensive. Such&#13;
works would therefore be carried out under contracts let through standard&#13;
National competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to IDA. For drainage&#13;
structures included in the minor works program, a separate tender would be&#13;
invited for all structures in a polder. The packages would include new and&#13;
replacement structures, and structures requiring repairs. Such packages would&#13;
include the supply and installation of gates and lifting mechanisms. For NCB&#13;
contracts for minor works. it was agreed at neQotiations that particivation&#13;
would be limited to bidders of Class A registration (or foreicrn firms meetinci&#13;
eauivalent standards).  In addition Pre-aualification of bidders in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to IDA would be recauired for contracts for structures.&#13;
Earthworks would be aroused to provide a minimum contract size of US$150,000&#13;
eauivalent.&#13;
2.33      For civil works estimated to cost more than US$150,000, bid&#13;
documents would be submitted to IDA for prior review, and IDA's concurrence&#13;
would be obtained before contracts are awarded. This would cover all&#13;
investment costs on civil works. It is estimated that the prior review&#13;
exercise would involve about 40 contract packages (9 for major works and 30&#13;
for minor works). Contracts less than US$150,000 would be limited to the&#13;
maintenance works for the embankments and structures. Periodic maintenance&#13;
works would either be awarded to community maintenance groups at the&#13;
engineer's estimated prices or implemented through contracts awarded following&#13;
NCB procedures to small local contractors. For contracts estimated to cost&#13;
US$150,000 or less, bid documents and evaluations would be retained by BWDB&#13;
and made available to IDA representatives upon request. Force account work in&#13;
respect of earthworks would be carried out only in exceptional circumstances,&#13;
such as an emergency operation, and would be restricted to amounts under&#13;
US$10,000 for each case up to a aggregate of US$500,000. Maintenance work&#13;
following a cyclone, monsoon storms or floods, for which partial financing is&#13;
available under the project, would be carried out generally in packages&#13;
costing less than US$150,000, through contracts awarded following NCB&#13;
procedures. In addition community groups could be awarded some of these&#13;
works. The procedure for contracting and reviewing of bid documents would be&#13;
similar to that described above for periodic maintenance. Routine maintenance&#13;
would be carried out by individual families (see para 2.16).&#13;
2.34      Earthworks included in the investment costs for re-excavation of&#13;
khals, valued at US$3.6 million equivalent (including contingencies), are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
expected to be executed under FFW programs according to procedures agreed&#13;
between GOB and WFP. Procurement of vehicles and equipment valued at US$0.7&#13;
million would be through NCB procedures. Contracts of US$100,000 or more&#13;
would be subject to prior review. The procurement in this category is spread&#13;
over seven different types of vehicles (4 wheel drive vehicles, motorcycles,&#13;
bicycles, boats, rickshaw vans, etc.) Foreign firms with appropriate vehicle&#13;
maintenance facilities to be eligible to bid would have local agents in&#13;
Bangladesh. Small items and a small quantity of vehicles required for&#13;
facilitating an early start to implementation would be procured on a prudent&#13;
shopping basis and limited to US$50,000 for a package, up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$200,000. Consultants, training, the services of NGOs, and resettlement&#13;
costs would be financed by the European Community and would be procured&#13;
following EC guidelines. The contracts for consultants and NGO services would&#13;
include the costs of vehicles and equipment for their use. BWDB/FD would&#13;
select NGOs based on criteria acceptable to IDA/EC which would include the&#13;
NGOs' experience in the respective project areas, demonstrated leadership and&#13;
staff capabilities, and ability to work with target groups, local government&#13;
representatives and implementing agencies. NGO contracts would be subject to&#13;
IDA and EC a2roval.&#13;
K. Disbursements&#13;
2.35      Disbursements of the IDA Credit would extend over the period 1995-&#13;
2002. However, disbursements after December 31, 2000 would be limited to&#13;
improved O&amp;M activities and replacement motorcycles or bicycles for field&#13;
staff supervising O&amp;M and afforestation. IDA disbursements would cover:&#13;
(a) 90% of civil works expenditures, including construction materials&#13;
but excluding khal excavation;&#13;
(b) 100% of BWDB estimated expenditure on administration and&#13;
engineering of project works, based on 5% and 10% of the cost of&#13;
major and minor civil works;&#13;
(c) 90% of costs of surveys, investigations and studies carried out by&#13;
GOB agencies;&#13;
(d) an average of about 65% of expenditures on improved O&amp;M activities,&#13;
to be disbursed at 85% of expenditures through FY99, 65% for FY00&#13;
and FY01, and 45% thereafter; and&#13;
(e) 100% of foreign expenditures on directly imported vehicles and&#13;
equipment, 100% of the ex-factory price of such goods manufactured&#13;
in Bangladesh, and 70% of expenditures for off the shelf locally&#13;
procured goods.&#13;
2.36      Full documentation would be sent to IDA in support of withdrawal&#13;
applications, except for items (b), (c), and (d) above, small civil work&#13;
contracts costing less than the equivalent of US$150,000 each, and contracts&#13;
for vehicles or equipment costing less than the equivalent of $100,000 each.&#13;
For these items, applications for the BWDB components would be supported by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
statements of expenditure certified by the Project Director of the PIU. The&#13;
relevant documentation would be retained at the PIU office and should be&#13;
available for review by IDA representatives on request. This documentation&#13;
would also be subject to audit.  It was acFreed during ne-cotiations that&#13;
sumportinq documentation for withdrawal avplications for civil works would be&#13;
certified by the consultant resDonsible for imDlementation suiDort. confirming&#13;
the auantitv of work Derformed and that work has conformed to the technical&#13;
specifications of the contract acrreements. All documents sent to IDA in&#13;
support of withdrawal applications, including statements of expenditure, would&#13;
have been checked and certified by the implementation support consultant.&#13;
2.37      The disbursement schedule (Annex 1) reflects the anticipated&#13;
sequence of activities in implementation and has been based on the assumption&#13;
that disbursement for works in one quarter would be completed within the next&#13;
two quarters. The average disbursement period for water development projects&#13;
in Bangladesh has been nine years. However, a five-year implementation period&#13;
for civil works construction is considered feasible in view of the intended&#13;
tendering for the major works and commencement of land acquisition procedures&#13;
before Board presentation, use of consultants and ICB procurement for the&#13;
major works, and community pressure for expeditious action based upon the&#13;
experience of the 1991 cyclone.&#13;
2.38      Timely settlement of progress payments to contractors is crucial to&#13;
the speedy implementation of project works. To facilitate payments, ensure&#13;
the availability of funds, and reduce the number of withdrawal applications&#13;
submitted to IDA, GOB would open and thereafter maintain a special account in&#13;
U.S. dollars with the Bangladesh Bank in Dhaka.  The authorized allocation for&#13;
the special account would be US$4.0 million equivalent. This allocation&#13;
represents an estimated four months of IDA-financed expenditure during the&#13;
peak construction period. The special account would be replenished through&#13;
reimbursements on a monthly basis and would be used exclusively for IDA's&#13;
share of financing.&#13;
L. Accounts and Audits&#13;
2.39      BWDB and FD would maintain adequate records, in line with&#13;
guidelines on financial reporting and auditing of World Bank projects, to&#13;
identify physical progress and financial transactions relating to the project.&#13;
Individually identifiable accounts would also be kept for: (a) all&#13;
expenditure for which credit withdrawals are made on the basis of statements&#13;
of expenditure (para 2.36); and (b) the flow of funds from the Special&#13;
Account. Separate project accounts would be kept by BWDB and FD. Auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA would audit these accounts, including statements of&#13;
expenditure and operation of the Special Account. Audited accounts, together&#13;
with auditors' comments, would be sent to IDA within six months of the close&#13;
of the fiscal year. At present, accounts of BWDB and the FD are audited by&#13;
the Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh. BWDB accounts are also&#13;
audited by its Internal Directorate of Audits. These arrangements are&#13;
satisfactory to IDA.  Agreement on the above arrangements was confirmed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEIHNT&#13;
3.1       A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would be established in&#13;
Chittagong, under the Member implementation, with a Project Director of the&#13;
rank of a Chief or Additional Chief Engineer responsible for the overall&#13;
management for all BWDB components of the project and preparing and submitting&#13;
quarterly progress reports (including sections to be submitted by FD on&#13;
afforestation activities). The Project Director would be assisted by two&#13;
Superintending Engineers, who would be Deputy Project Directors for&#13;
Implementation and O&amp;M, a Deputy Director Resettlement who would head the&#13;
Project Resettlement Unit, and the project consultants. FD would appoint a&#13;
full-time Project Director Afforestation (para 3.4), based in Chittagong, who&#13;
would head a small separate Forestry Project Implementation Unit (FPIU) and&#13;
would, inter alia, liaise with the PIU to ensure coordination between the&#13;
activities of the civil works and afforestation components and the respective&#13;
maintenance activities. A Project Coordinator, based in Dhaka, at the&#13;
Superintending Engineer level, will assist the Project Director in monitoring&#13;
and coordination. The PIU would be responsible, inter alia for:&#13;
(a) planning the implementation of the project, in cooperation with the&#13;
field divisions, including reviewing and consolidating annual&#13;
budget requests prepared by the field divisions, monitoring&#13;
progress of project implementation and taking action required to&#13;
eliminate bottlenecks, and keeping track of implementation&#13;
schedules to facilitate coordination among construction,&#13;
afforestation, land acquisition and resettlement, and O&amp;M&#13;
activities;&#13;
(b) coordinating the activities of the main project consultants and&#13;
contracting with and coordinating the work of the resettlement&#13;
consultants and NGOs assisting in implementation of the embankment&#13;
maintenance/afforestation components;&#13;
(c) overseeing the preparation and processing of tender documents for&#13;
minor civil works by field divisions and award of contracts;&#13;
(d) preparing and processing of tender documents and the award of&#13;
contracts for procurement of BWDB equipment and vehicles, and for&#13;
completion of portions of major civil works not completed under&#13;
PWP, and additional works to cope with recent erosion at the&#13;
southern end of Sandwip;&#13;
(e) monitoring project environmental and social impact and organizing&#13;
implementation of appropriate mitigating measures;&#13;
(f) overseeing project accounts and ensuring timely submission of&#13;
disbursement requests to IDA;&#13;
(g) assisting the Training Directorate in preparing and executing O&amp;M&#13;
training programs for the CERP polders;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
(h) coordinating preparation of proposals for utilization of the&#13;
Community Development Fund and implementation of approved&#13;
activities under this Fund by NGOs; and&#13;
(i) preparing six-monthly reports on the progress of the project.&#13;
A PIU, with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, has been established and&#13;
the Project Director and the two Deputy Project Directors and the Deputy&#13;
Director Resettlement have been appointed. The maintenance of the PIU until&#13;
prolect completion was acqreed at negotiations.&#13;
3.2       Field operations for the rehabilitation and improvement components&#13;
would be carried out through: (i) two new and one existing implementation&#13;
circles, located at Cox's Bazaar, Noahkhali and Barisal respectively, headed&#13;
by Superintending Engineers; (ii) an implementation unit for the works in&#13;
Chittagong area, directly controlled by PIU, and headed by the Deputy Project&#13;
Director, Implementation; (iii) seven implementation divisions, headed by&#13;
Executive Engineers, two located at Cox's Bazaar, one each at Chittagong,&#13;
Sonapur, Ramgati, Barguna, and Sharankhola; and (iv) thirteen implementation&#13;
subdivisions one for each polder with ICB works. By adjustments to the areas&#13;
of jurisdiction of the existing O&amp;M divisions and the transfer of some of the&#13;
O&amp;M divisions to implementation, it is proposed that the divisional set up&#13;
would consist of three new divisions and four divisions transferred from the&#13;
existing O&amp;M set up. Project Consultants would provide substantial assistance&#13;
(described in more detail in Annex 6). Responsibilities of the implementation&#13;
divisions, in association with the divisional and site staff of the&#13;
consultant, would include: the construction supervision and quality control&#13;
of civil works; preparation of tender documents and selection of contractors&#13;
for minor works; accounting and financial control of construction contracts;&#13;
coordinating with the Project Resettlement Units to ensure that land&#13;
acquisition is accomplished as required by the contract schedules; and&#13;
coordination with the O&amp;M divisions to ensure that maintenance work starts as&#13;
soon as appropriate sections of construction work have been completed.&#13;
3.3       Six existing divisions, located at Cox's Bazaar, Chittagong,&#13;
Noahkhali, Lokhipur, Barguna, and Bagerhat, would function under the direction&#13;
of the existing O&amp;M Zonal Chief Engineers and Circle Superintending Engineers&#13;
and would carry out all operations and maintenance activities in the PWP and&#13;
CERP polders. The Superintending Engineer of the O&amp;M Circle at Chittagong&#13;
would, in addition to his other duties, serve as Deputy Project Director O&amp;M,&#13;
and would assist the Project Director in coordinating project O&amp;M activities.&#13;
O&amp;M works would be carried out under five existing O&amp;M circles located at&#13;
Cox's Bazaar, Chittagong, Feni, Faridpur and Khulna, which would continue to&#13;
be responsible for their current work in addition to the work under the&#13;
project. Eighteen subdivisions would be set up covering one or two polders.&#13;
This would be achieved through a combination of changing the jurisdiction of&#13;
some existing subdivisions and creating new subdivisions where necessary.&#13;
Responsibilities of the O&amp;M wing would include: (a) operation of regulators&#13;
and sluices; (b) preparation of tender documents and award and supervision of&#13;
contracts for periodic maintenance of embankments and drainage canals, and&#13;
routine maintenance by Contractors; (c) assistance tc NGOs and quality control&#13;
of routine maintenance by embankment settlers; and (d) accounting and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
financial control of O&amp;M activities, including payments to embankment settlers&#13;
and NGOs for activities concerning embankment maintenance and afforestation.&#13;
3.4       Forest Department (FD) activities would be coordinated by a FPIU in&#13;
Chittagong, under the direction of a senior officer (of Division Forest&#13;
Officer or higher rank) who would be designated Project Director&#13;
Afforestation. The project responsibilities of BWDB and FD and the&#13;
implementation arrangements for afforestation has been set out in an agreement&#13;
between the two organizations. FD would be responsible for foreshore&#13;
afforestation (including mangrove nurseries), technical assistance and funding&#13;
support for NGO establishment of nurseries for non-mangrove species (for both&#13;
embankment slopes and foreshore), and providing assistance to BWDB for&#13;
embankment afforestation activities (mainly providing advice and training to&#13;
NGOs organizing these activities). The agreement includes provision for close&#13;
coordination between the PIU and the FPIU in the implementation of the&#13;
project. Work would be carried out by three units headed by Assistant&#13;
Conservators of Forests assigned to the project by FD. These three units&#13;
would be established at Chittagong, Noahkhali, and Patuakhali respectively.&#13;
Nursery operations for the mangroves and assistance to NGOs in nursery&#13;
operations for other species would be carried out by regular staff of the&#13;
divisions participating in the project. The extension wing would contract&#13;
services with local NGOs to organize and train community participants to&#13;
engage in the afforestation components of the project (as described in paras&#13;
2.12 and 2.13), and supervise their work. FD would be responsible for the&#13;
procurement of the vehicles included in the project for this component. FD&#13;
would keep separate accounts for foreshore afforestation, its own nursery&#13;
activities, and advances to NGOs for nursery establishment. The FPIU would&#13;
maintain adequate accounting staff for this purpose. The FPIU would also&#13;
supply information to the PIU for inclusion in consolidated quarterly progress&#13;
reports. The FPIU has been established with terms of reference satisfactory&#13;
to IDA, and the Project Director Afforestation has been appointed. The&#13;
maintenance of FPIU until proliect completion was agreed at negotiations.&#13;
3.5       Land acauisition and resettlement activities would be carried out&#13;
by the Project Resettlement Unit of the PIU, headed by a Deputy Director&#13;
Resettlement located in Chittagong, and work would be carried out by four&#13;
subunits established at Cox's Bazaar, Chittagong, Noahkhali, and Barguna.&#13;
Each subunit would have a Regional Project Resettlement Officer, a Revenue&#13;
Officer, an Accountant, and a Surveyor. The consultants who prepared the&#13;
draft resettlement plan with regard to land to be acquired for embankment&#13;
retirement would be contracted to use their data base from their survey to&#13;
assist the Deputy Commissioners and the Project Resettlement Unit to establish&#13;
entitlements for land required for the first year of construction.14&#13;
Entitlements specified under the law would be paid by the Deputy&#13;
Commissioners, while additional entitlements agreed under the project (Annex&#13;
9) would be paid by the Project Resettlement Unit. Special Land Acquisition&#13;
Officers deputed to the Deputy Commissioners would be appointed at Cox's&#13;
Bazaar, Chittagong, and Laxmipur to assist the Deputy Commissioners in dealing&#13;
14.   The resettlement consultants are a separate firm, independent from the&#13;
general project consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
with polders with large numbers of affected people. The resettlement&#13;
consultants would subcontract with NGOs active in the project areas to work&#13;
with people affected by land acquisition, verify payments, and participate in&#13;
grievance committees. Consultants have been hired for acquisition of land&#13;
required for the first year's construction program, the Resettlement Units&#13;
have been established and staffed and the joint verification of appropriate&#13;
compensation for land required for the first year's construction has been&#13;
initiated, using the services of NGOs acceptable to IDA. Following credit&#13;
signature, it is expected that the contracts of the resettlement consultants&#13;
would be extended to cover land required for subsequent construction years.&#13;
This would also include carrying out new surveys of land required for&#13;
embankment widening (about 175 ha), land required for homesteads for&#13;
embankment settlers (about 35 ha), and areas where the alignment has changed&#13;
from the original survey, as well as updating survey information on embankment&#13;
squatters. The arrangements for resettling of these squatters are described&#13;
in para 2.12.&#13;
3.6       As described in para 2.21 above, the project consultants would play&#13;
a major role in assisting BWDB and FD in execution of the Project. The&#13;
consultants would have their headquarters in Chittagong with a Team Leader and&#13;
design staff, three regional field units headed by Chief construction&#13;
Engineers, four divisional field units (probably at Cox's Bazaar, Sandwip&#13;
Sonapur, and Barguna) headed by Resident Construction Engineers, and field&#13;
site offices at each polder headed by Assistant Resident Engineers. The site&#13;
offices would be adequately staffed with technical staff to ensure the&#13;
required construction standards.&#13;
3.7       It is envisaged that between 10 to 20 NGOs would be involved in the&#13;
community participation aspects of the project. Provision is included in the&#13;
estimated costs of NGO services for financing by the participating NGOs of one&#13;
full-time representative, elected by the participating NGOs, who would be&#13;
responsible for presenting NGO views to the Government, identifying training&#13;
needs, and coordinating the sharing of experience of NGOs. This&#13;
representative would work closely with the PIU and contribute to progress&#13;
reports. NGOs would be represented on the project's regional and local level&#13;
coordinating committees described below. Each participating NGO would appoint&#13;
a senior officer as its project director, responsible for contractual matters&#13;
and overall supervision of its project-related activities.&#13;
Coordinating Committees&#13;
3.8       A Project Coordinating Committee, chaired by the Project Director,&#13;
would meet at a minimum of every three months to review progress and problems&#13;
and issue necessary policy decisions and directives. This committee would&#13;
include as members the Project Director Afforestation, the Deputy Project&#13;
Directors for Implementation and O&amp;M, the Deputy Director Resettlement,&#13;
Director Field Services Division, Department of Agriculture and Extension&#13;
(DAE), Ministry of Agriculture, and an elected representative of the&#13;
participating NGOs. A representative of the project consultants would attend&#13;
as an observer. In each participating district a District Project&#13;
Coordinating Committee would be established to review progress and ensure&#13;
coordination at the regional level. These committees would be headed by a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Deputy Commissioner and would include as members two Executive Engineers&#13;
(implementation and O&amp;M), the District Forestry Officer, an elected district&#13;
NGO representative, and a district level representative of DAE, and a&#13;
consultants representative as an observer. At the Thana level, a committee&#13;
would be set up in each Thana in the Project Area, headed by the Thana Nirbani&#13;
Officer and including as members the Union Parishad chairmen for all Unions in&#13;
the Thana included in the Project Area, the BWDB Subdivisional Engineer, the&#13;
FD Range Officer, and representatives of the participating NGO and DAE,15&#13;
and a consultants representative as an observer. The committee would&#13;
disseminate information on the project activities in the Thana, seek&#13;
beneficiary comments and suggestions, assist in land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement, encourage community participation in the afforestation and O&amp;M&#13;
activities, supervise the adequacy of the embankment O&amp;M and afforestation&#13;
activities (organizing community pressure in case of problems), and provide&#13;
community support in preventing encroachment on the embankment by squatters.&#13;
Agreement was reached during negotiations that the committees, as described&#13;
above, would be established by November 15. 1995 and that such committees&#13;
would be maintained throughout the prolect implementation period.&#13;
Mid-Term Reviews&#13;
3.9       To examine project progress, GOB would carry out two mid-term&#13;
reviews, at the end of the second and fourth project year. PIU and FD would&#13;
organize the reviews and prepare terms of reference in consultation with IDA.&#13;
The reviews would focus on resolving any remaining bottlenecks in the civil&#13;
work programs and adjusting the project in response to lessons drawn from&#13;
experience under the O&amp;M and afforestation components. The first of the two&#13;
reviews would benefit from the initial experience in applying the O&amp;M and&#13;
afforestation components in the PWP polders, while the second review would&#13;
provide opportunities for mid-term corrections based upon the experience with&#13;
the polders with major civil works financed under this project. The reviews&#13;
would provide a detailed examination of problems encountered and make&#13;
recommendations for improving project implementation and modifying the&#13;
project, if found appropriate. The project consultants and participating NGOs&#13;
would participate in these reviews. AQreement was reached with GOB durinQ&#13;
neaotiations that it would undertake these reviews, discuss the findings with&#13;
IDA. and revise the Project Proforma. as necessary, to oromptlv reflect&#13;
proiect revisions agreed with IDA.&#13;
IV.   PRODUCTION. MARKETING. AND FARM INCOMES&#13;
A. Agricultural Production&#13;
4.1       Estimation of the project's expected impact on agricultural&#13;
production and farm incomes has been based on a detailed analysis of farming&#13;
practices and agro-ecological conditions in each of the 11 polders with major&#13;
works financed under the project. The methodology, major assumptions, and&#13;
15.   Other members could be added if GOB so wishes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
detailed results are presented in Annex 8. The project is expected to lead to&#13;
increased agricultural production due to three major factors: (a) prevention&#13;
of salinity intrusions and storm surges during normal monsoons and cyclones;&#13;
(b) adoption of high yielding varieties (HYVs) because the increased security&#13;
provided against periodic devastation during severe cyclones would encourage&#13;
the required investment for HYV production; and (c) improvement of drainage&#13;
conditions in the polders. These factors would lead to increased agricultural&#13;
output through higher crop yields per ha, increased cropping intensity,&#13;
shifting cropping patterns from local to HYVs, and accelerated crop&#13;
diversification.&#13;
4.2       It is anticipated that yield per ha per cropping season would&#13;
increase by 10-15% for the same crop variety due to protection against&#13;
intrusion of saline water, improved drainage conditions in the kharif&#13;
season16, and protection against flooding caused by cyclones and storm&#13;
surges or heavy rainfall during the monsoon. It is also expected that in the&#13;
absence of the project, increased salinity due to existing or imminent&#13;
breaches in the embankments, poor drainage and flooding would, over time,&#13;
reduce yields to the level observed outside the embankments. All current HYV&#13;
production would switch to local varieties within two years and the average&#13;
yield of local varieties of rice would be reduced over a period of five years&#13;
to about one ton per ha, which is the average yield of T. Aman under saline&#13;
conditions.&#13;
4.3       Cropping intensity in the project area ranges from 108% (Polder&#13;
35/1) to 174% (Polder 72), the average being 136%. The national average is&#13;
about 171%. Saline soil conditions limit crop cultivation during the dry&#13;
season.   Cropping intensity in the "with project" situation is expected to&#13;
increase by about 20%. The area under kharif crops would increase due to&#13;
protection from floods as well as improved drainage and the area under rabi&#13;
crops17 would increase as a result of soil salinity reduction. With the&#13;
project, the cropping intensity is expected to range from about 130% (Polder&#13;
73/1A&amp;B) to 210% (Polder 66/1), the average being 155%.&#13;
4.4        Adoption of HYVs of rice is limited in these areas due to high&#13;
soil and water salinity, as these varieties have little or no tolerance to&#13;
salinity. With protection against saline water and improvement of drainage&#13;
conditions, increased cultivation of HYVs of rice is expected to occur.&#13;
Depending upon the degree of sharecropping in each polder, between 20 and 40%&#13;
of T. Aman area is expected to shift to HYV in the kharif season. During the&#13;
rabi season, HYV boro cultivation is expected to increase only in Polder 66/1&#13;
where fresh underground water is available for irrigation. Cultivation of&#13;
HYVs of other rabi crops such as watermelon and betel leaf will also increase&#13;
in the "with project" situation, especially in the polders in Cox's Bazaar&#13;
district.&#13;
16.   Summer cropping season (May through November).&#13;
17.    Crops grown during the winter cropping season (November through May).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
4.5       More land would come under diversified crops such as pulses,&#13;
oilseeds, cowpeas, chillies, winter vegetables, and sweet potatoes in the rabi&#13;
season due to reduced soil salinity. The changes in cropping pattern&#13;
resulting from the project are expected to occur in a period of seven years.&#13;
4.6       Projected annual incremental crop production is summarized in&#13;
Table 4.1. Total annual production, at full development, with the project is&#13;
expected to increase by about 87,700 m tons (or 56%) on average over the&#13;
"without project" situation. This consists of the sum of 70,400 m tons of&#13;
additional production over the present situation plus avoidance of an&#13;
anticipated 17,300 m tons decrease in production without the project, due to&#13;
increasing salinity. This production estimate is based on the net cultivable&#13;
land of about 49,900 ha in 11 of the 12 polders under the project16 and&#13;
excludes the cultivable land protected under the PWP. It is expected that the&#13;
target production would be achieved in seven years' time when the projected&#13;
changes in cropping pattern would be completed. The expected increase in&#13;
production would be higher if not for the constraints that the farmers will&#13;
still have to face. These constraints include limited fresh water for&#13;
irrigation during the dry season, unfavorable tenancy agreements19 that&#13;
discourage the tenant farmers from investing in land improvement and intensive&#13;
cultivation, existence of absentee/large landowners who do not pay much&#13;
attention to crop intensification, and poor quality of draft animals and&#13;
shortage of mechanical cultivators for land preparation. These constraints&#13;
have been taken into account when projecting increase in production.&#13;
B. Marketing and Prices&#13;
4.7       Farmers in the project area sell their surplus crop production&#13;
largely through the traditional marketing system in which prices are&#13;
determined by market forces. The system seems to work fairly efficiently.&#13;
Many farmers sell some portion of the output immediately after harvest to meet&#13;
their cash requirements, and then buy some of the same products later in the&#13;
season to meet their consumption needs. The increased crop production is not&#13;
expected to create any major marketing difficulty despite the record&#13;
performance in rice production at the national level in recent years. Rice&#13;
shortages exist in the areas covered by the project. The expected increase in&#13;
production is not likely to have a substantial impact on the national level.&#13;
Bangladesh still imports some of the foodgrains required for domestic&#13;
consumption, especially in years of bad weather. Actual foodgrain imports&#13;
declined from 2.9 million metric tons in FY88 to 0.8 million metric tons (food&#13;
18.   Polder 60, where project civil works include only 2 km of embankment&#13;
strengthening plus khal excavation, is excluded from the analysis.&#13;
More time is required to test the effectiveness of recently completed&#13;
anti-erosion works before firm estimates can be justified.&#13;
19.   Thirty to forty percent of rural households operate land under&#13;
different tenancy arrangements, the most widespread being sharecropping&#13;
under which the tenant agrees to bear all costs and pays 50* of gross&#13;
output to the landlord. The agreement is usually for one crop season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
aid plus commercial imports) in FY93. Imports increased in FY95 due to a 7%&#13;
reduction in foodgrain production resulting from drought and fertilizer&#13;
distribution problems. While continued growth of rice production could create&#13;
surpluses on a national level (in years of good weather), Bangladesh has the&#13;
option of either reducing wheat imports or taking measures to encourage crop&#13;
diversification. Farmers have the choice of selling their surplus foodgrains&#13;
under GOB's procurement program, but they are most likely to sell in the local&#13;
markets since local market prices tend to be higher than GOB procurement&#13;
prices. No downward pressure on market prices is expected.&#13;

4.8       GOB has taken actions in recent years to minimize distortions in&#13;
agricultural input prices and the distribution system in order to promote an&#13;
improved allocation of resources and maximize access to a wide range of inputs&#13;
to give farmers the flexibility to respond quickly to changing incentives. In&#13;
particular, the distribution of fertilizers and pesticides is now&#13;
predominantly handled by the private sector and restrictions on importation&#13;
and distribution of power tillers and minor irrigation equipment have been&#13;
removed. Private sector participation is also being allowed in seed&#13;
marketing. Consequently, farmers are not expected to face serious&#13;
difficulties with respect to availability of these inputs. However, limited&#13;
access to agricultural credit may constrain production. There has also been&#13;
backtracking on some of the fertilizer pricing and distribution reforms during&#13;
the 1994/95 season. Unusually high world market prices for urea led to higher&#13;
than normal exports. This happened at a time when domestic demand was higher,&#13;
resulting from higher price of rice. The additional exports created scarcity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
in urea and the government's response was an array of distribution controls,&#13;
including a maximum retail price, quotas on lifting from the factories, and&#13;
intervention of district administrators. It is understood that the&#13;
backtracking on distribution liberalization was only a temporary reaction to&#13;
this situation.&#13;
C. Farm Incomes&#13;
4.9       Farm budget analysis shows that reduction of salinity intrusions&#13;
and storm surges and improvement of the drainage system would have a&#13;
significant impact on farm incomes. The effect of the project on annual farm&#13;
incomes is analyzed on the basis of a farm budget model for the "present" and&#13;
"with project" situation for each polder. The budget is presented on a one ha&#13;
farm since most households in the area operate farms of about that size. The&#13;
analysis is done separately for each polder because of differences such as&#13;
soil quality and cropping patterns between polders. Cost of production, gross&#13;
income, and net income per ha are estimated for each crop under the "present"&#13;
and "with project" assumptions using constant 1991 farmgate prices (see Annex&#13;
11, Table 1 for the computation of input and output prices). A summary of the&#13;
farm income is presented in Table 4.2 while detailed farm budgets for each&#13;
polder are presented in Annex 8.&#13;
4.10      The analysis shows that the investment in the project would have a&#13;
significant impact on the incomes of the farm families in the area (Table&#13;
4.2). The average net increase in income from one ha farms would vary from&#13;
about 20% (Polder 59/2) to 1151 (Polder 35/1). In value terms, the range&#13;
would be from about Tk 2,100 (Polder 73/lA&amp;B) to Tk 11,300 (Polder 66/1). The&#13;
average increase in net income from a one-ha farm for all the polders would be&#13;
about Tk 5,200 or 47%. The increase in average farm income is expected to be&#13;
higher in the polders in Cox's Bazaar district, where intensive cropping is&#13;
practiced, than in the polders in Burguna or Bagerhat districts.&#13;
4.11      The additional farm incomes would also benefit tenants and landless&#13;
laborers, in addition to benefiting owner-operators. The percentage share of&#13;
the benefits is not expected to differ substantially from the present&#13;
arrangements. Everybody would gain in proportion to present income levels.&#13;
Thus, most of the people in the project area are expected to have strong&#13;
incentives to support the project.&#13;

a/ Gross production value minus production cost.&#13;
D. Afforestation: Production. Incomes and Marketing&#13;
4.12      Forestry models and farm budgets are discussed in detail in&#13;
Annex 4.  Estimated annual production from the proposed afforestation&#13;
component is summarized in Annex 4, Table 7. The main outputs that would come&#13;
from afforestation are fruits, vegetables, timber, and fuelwood. About&#13;
227,600 m tons of fruits and vegetables and 224 million cubic feet of timber&#13;
and fuelwood are projected to be produced over the project life of 30 years.&#13;
While about 90% of the output of fruits and vegetables is projected to come&#13;
from the embankment slope and the rest from the homesteads, about 95% of the&#13;
timber output is projected to come from the foreshore.&#13;
4.13      Fruits and timber would be the two major products expected from the&#13;
afforestation on embankment slopes and foreshore. The incremental output as a&#13;
result of the project is not likely to create marketing problems. Fruits are&#13;
in short supply in the coastal belt as well as in the rest of the country for&#13;
most of the year. Timber and fuelwood are also in short supply. The timber&#13;
is used in constructing houses and building boats. There is a large fishing&#13;
community in the project area. Given access to other coastal areas by water&#13;
and, to some extent, by road, any surplus output in a given area would be&#13;
transported to deficit areas without much difficulty.&#13;
4.14      Estimated net incomes from afforestation on the embankment slope,&#13;
foreshore, and homestead land are summarized in Annex 4, Tables 8, 9, and 10,&#13;
respectively. Projected net financial benefits from the afforestation over a&#13;
30-year period is Tk 5,000 million of which about 20%, 75*, and 2% would come&#13;
from the embankment slope, foreshore, and homestead plantation, respectively.&#13;
Net positive incomes from the afforestation, if all inputs including family&#13;
labor were valued at market prices, would begin to be realized from the first,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
fourth, and ninth year of afforestation on the homestead land, embankment&#13;
slope, and foreshore, respectively. However, given that the Government would&#13;
provide the seedlings and the first three years' requirements of fertilizer&#13;
and pesticides, and that embankment settlers would be using their own family&#13;
labor, settlers on the embankment would be receiving a positive income from&#13;
the embankment and homestead from year one. The payments the families receive&#13;
for routine embankment maintenance would be set to provide sufficient&#13;
supplementary income to produce an annual income of Tk 9,000 per family2O.&#13;
Such payments would decrease progressively as production from the embankment&#13;
and homestead increase, with settlers expected to achieve an annual income of&#13;
about Tk 9,000 per family without further Government payment in the fifth&#13;
year. (For safety sake, the project cost estimates include an allowance for&#13;
the possibility of delays or other problems resulting in some families&#13;
requiring a continued payment in Year five). Similarly for the foreshore&#13;
plantation, the costs of seedlings, fertilizer, and pesticides for three years&#13;
is a Government cost covered under the project. For the foreshore, the&#13;
Government would also cover the cost of labor for planting. Thus the only&#13;
costs prior to production through year eight are small costs for guarding&#13;
against poachers. (These costs are assumed to be met by family labor in the&#13;
case of community management on Government land.)&#13;
V. BENEFITS. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries&#13;
5.1       The main project benefits would be fewer human lives lost and less&#13;
property destroyed during cyclones, and prevention of salinity intrusions and&#13;
storm surges during normal monsoons, leading to increased agricultural&#13;
production and employment. Complementary works under the project would&#13;
improve drainage, further increasing agricultural production. Social forestry&#13;
for cyclone protection and embankment maintenance would have ancillary&#13;
benefits in poverty alleviation, environmental improvement, and increased&#13;
output of wood and other forestry products.&#13;
5.2       The operation would directly benefit about 1.2 million people&#13;
living in the project area. This includes about 600,000 people living where&#13;
the sea-facing embankments would be rehabilitated and another 600,000 people&#13;
benefitting from improved embankment O&amp;M, afforestation, and minor embankment&#13;
improvements for polders for which the rehabilitation of the sea-facing&#13;
embankments was financed under PWP.&#13;
20.   There would be an exception for two polders as discussed in the&#13;
footnote to para 2.12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Protection of Human Lives&#13;
5.3       Benefits in human lives saved are impossible to quantify and are&#13;
not included in the economic analysis. However, it is estimated that about&#13;
140,000 people were killed in the project area during the 1991 cyclone. The&#13;
embankments would help save lives during future cyclones. Although&#13;
overtopping could still occur after the construction of the new embankments,&#13;
the flooding of the polders would be slowed and reduced. The massive sudden&#13;
flooding of 1991, which happened due to breaches in the embankments or missing&#13;
sections, would not happen in a "with project" situation. Delayed flooding&#13;
would give more time for the people to escape to safer areas or cyclone&#13;
shelters.&#13;
Production Benefits&#13;
5.4       Most of the quantifiable benefits would come from increased crop&#13;
production in normal years. The embankments would protect a gross area of&#13;
about 191,000 ha (excluding the area protected by sea-facing embankments&#13;
financed under PWP). The project would directly benefit about 66,500 ha of&#13;
net cultivable land21 through protection from saline inundation and through&#13;
improved drainage. This would increase annual crop production at full&#13;
development from about 157,400 m tons in the "without project" scenario to&#13;
245,100 m tons in the "with project" scenario (an increase of about 40W and&#13;
56W over the present and "without project" situation, respectively).&#13;
5.5       Beyond the benefits afforded during monsoons and normal cyclones,&#13;
the embankments would provide additional benefits from protecting crops and&#13;
livestock during major cyclones. It is conservatively estimated that about&#13;
50* and 40% of the crops would be saved in the case of cyclonic surges with a&#13;
return period of 10 and 20 years, respectively. Over 50,000 head of cattle&#13;
were lost during the 1991 cyclone; many would have been saved had the&#13;
embankments not breached. Improved embankments and sluices would also&#13;
preserve shrimp farms, culture fisheries and salt production.&#13;
Protection of Property and Infrastructure&#13;
5.6       The project would protect houses, schools and administrative and&#13;
commercial buildings. About 864,000 houses were destroyed and another 774,000&#13;
were damaged during the 1991 cyclone. Protection would also be provided to&#13;
public infrastructure such as roads, bridges and culverts. Regulators and&#13;
other infrastructure in shrimp farms would also be saved, especially from&#13;
cyclones with a return period of 10 and 20 years.&#13;
Afforestation Benefits&#13;
5.7       Afforestation of embankment slopes and a belt on the foreshore&#13;
would reduce cyclone damage and embankment O&amp;M costs (Annex 4, para 1).&#13;
Afforestation would provide fruits, timber, fuelwood, and fodder to workers in&#13;
embankment maintenance, to community groups in foreshore maintenance, and to&#13;
21.   Excluding Polder 60 and the PWP polders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
landowners on the foreshore whose land would be planted with trees (para&#13;
4.12). The use of mangrove areas as a fish and shrimp nursery is another&#13;
unquantified but substantial benefit.&#13;
Emplovment Benefits&#13;
5.8       The project would generate additional employment during&#13;
construction and through increased agricultural production made possible by&#13;
the embankments. It is estimated that demand for agricultural labor would&#13;
increase from about 190 days/ha per year to about 280 days/ha at full&#13;
development, for a total increase in agricultural employment of about 26,700&#13;
years. The additional demand for labor would come from greater area under&#13;
crops, adoption of HYVs, higher cropping intensity and extra labor needs for&#13;
harvesting. Additional labor would also be engaged in the routine maintenance&#13;
of the embankments and in the afforestation belt on the foreshore.&#13;
Other Benefits&#13;
5.9       The project would give other, unquantified, benefits in:&#13;
(i) savings on emergency relief. While the embankments would afford little&#13;
protection from high winds, they would provide protection against cyclonic&#13;
surge and would reduce post-cyclone relief costs for those affected by the&#13;
surge22; and (ii) environmental benefits: afforestation would also provide&#13;
environmental benefits as reducing salinity and lessened soil erosion&#13;
Distribution of Benefits and Poverty Alleviation&#13;
5.10      The project's benefits would be widely distributed and have a&#13;
positive impact on poverty. Estimated annual per capita income from a one-ha&#13;
farm in the project area is now about US$50 per annum. The project is&#13;
projected to raise this to about US$70 per annum at full development, an&#13;
increase of about 40%. The distribution of direct agricultural benefits would&#13;
be determined largely by landownership and tenurial arrangements. Women and&#13;
landless laborers would gain employment in land preparation, planting, weeding&#13;
and harvesting resulting from increased agricultural activities in the area.&#13;
Those groups would also get income from maintenance of the embankments (wage&#13;
income during the early years and the products of the trees on the embankments&#13;
and the afforestation belt during the later years) and wage income from&#13;
periodic maintenance jobs. While the project is not specifically poverty&#13;
focused, the loss of life and property during cyclones affects&#13;
disproportionately the poor, with weakly constructed houses and least ability&#13;
to recuperate.&#13;
22.   Such benefits are difficult to quantify and are not included in the&#13;
economic analysis of the project due to scarcity of data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
B. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.11            Economic analysis was done for each of 11 polders23 having&#13;
major works financed under this project. The overall economic rate of return&#13;
(ERR) for the project, excluding the value for human lives saved, is estimated&#13;
at 19.2%. The net present value (NPV) of net incremental benefits is&#13;
estimated at US$27.0 million, at an opportunity cost of capital of 12%.&#13;
Individual polder ERRs range from 6.6* (Polder 70, Matherbari) to 28.1%&#13;
(Polder 35/1, Sharankhola and Polder 59/3B, Sudharam) and all but three&#13;
polders have ERRs greater than 121.&#13;
5.12      Kuakata (Polder 48), Ramgati (Polder 59/2), and Matherbari (Polder&#13;
70) have ERRs less than 12% (7.9%, 6.9% and 6.6%, respectively). Even though&#13;
Polders 48, 59/2, and 70 cannot be justified on the ERR criterion, they are&#13;
fully justified taking account of the additional benefit of the savings in&#13;
human lives. For example, during the 1991 cyclone about 10,000 people were&#13;
killed in Polder 70 in a population of 23,000.&#13;
5.13            No calculations have been done on the PWP polders for which&#13;
this project is providing only ancillary investments in improved O&amp;M,&#13;
afforestation, and minor embankment improvements. Given that the major cost&#13;
of the polder improvements are for the sea-facing embankments, the&#13;
complementary investments to improve embankment life and remove minor&#13;
embankment deficiencies are inherently attractive.&#13;
C. Risks&#13;
5.14      The project confronts several important risks.&#13;
(a)  Insufficient community participation. A major risk is the possible&#13;
failure to engender sufficient community participation for&#13;
afforestation and routine embankment maintenance. Community&#13;
participation merges pieces of other programs, but is untried in&#13;
its proposed form. The cost of routine embankment maintenance&#13;
would increase substantially if the afforestation component failed&#13;
and future rehabilitation costs would also rise. The proposed&#13;
component has, nevertheless, a better probability of success than&#13;
traditional means of embankment maintenance precisely because it&#13;
involves beneficiary participation.&#13;
(b) Poor inter-institutional coordination. The community participation&#13;
component requires coordination between BWDB and FD. Poor&#13;
coordination could delay implementation and cause benefits to be&#13;
23.    Annex 11 presents the methodology and assumptions of the analysis.  A&#13;
twelfth polder (Polder 60: Sonagazi) was excluded from the economic&#13;
analysis because the project finances only minor works there. About $2&#13;
million of remaining work to complete PWP embankments in Anowara&#13;
(Polder 63/1A) has also been excluded from the analysis (See para 1.4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
foregone during the waiting period. The agreement between BWDB and&#13;
FD (para 2.11) is intended to reduce such delays. Two mid-term&#13;
reviews would help to adjust the operation if necessary, in light&#13;
of project experience.&#13;
(c) Inadecauate Government funding. The investment and O&amp;M costs of&#13;
this project can be met within available budgetary resources,&#13;
without distorting priorities. Nevertheless, inadequate Government&#13;
funding remains a risk, despite recent improvements. Inadequate&#13;
funding, like poor inter-institutional coordination, could delay&#13;
implementation and postpone benefits. However, the devastation&#13;
caused by the April 1991 cyclone is expected to lead to political&#13;
pressure to overcome problems which would delay the proposed&#13;
project. Inadequate financing of O&amp;M would reduce the life of the&#13;
investments requiring premature rehabilitation. The project, by&#13;
replacing existing deteriorated embankments, does not add to the&#13;
costs of adequate embankment maintenance. In fact the planting of&#13;
trees on the embankment and the use of settlers on the toe of the&#13;
embankment for routine maintenance (in return for the produce of&#13;
the trees) should reduce maintenance costs. Indicative budget&#13;
requirements for O&amp;M were agreed at negotiations. Finally, the&#13;
project has been designed to elicit greater community participation&#13;
and this is expected to bring additional pressure on the Government&#13;
to provide adequate funding.&#13;
(d)  ManaQement and institutional weaknesses. IDA experience in&#13;
Bangladesh shows that there is a risk of implementation delays, and&#13;
resulting cost increases, due to management/institutional&#13;
weaknesses. The risk of implementation delays and poor quality&#13;
construction is being addressed through the use of internationally&#13;
recruited consultants for supervision of construction, using&#13;
contractors for the sea-facing embankments selected through ICB,&#13;
after prequalification, and initiating tendering for the major&#13;
works and land acquisition for the first year's construction&#13;
program prior to Board presentation.&#13;
(e)  Overestimation of yields or farmer response.  The estimated yields&#13;
and rate of conversion to HYV are based on experience from other&#13;
areas in Bangladesh, adjusted to take account of limited&#13;
availability of dry season water supply and other constraints (para&#13;
4.6). While the resulting estimates are believed to be realistic,&#13;
all such estimates are subject to a margin of error.&#13;
D. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.15            The economic analysis was supplemented with a sensitivity&#13;
analysis based on the identified risks. The sensitivity of the ERRs was&#13;
measured in each polder with respect to adverse changes in key variables (para&#13;
5.14 and Annex 11, para. 15). Those variables are: (i) a failure of community&#13;
participation in embankment maintenance, causing O&amp;M cost to increase above&#13;
projected levels; (ii) implementation delays (due to institutional weaknesses,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
inadequate counterpart funds, and land acquisition problems) leading to&#13;
escalation in investment costs and deferral of benefits; and (iii) less than&#13;
expected increases in agricultural production. Adverse changes in the&#13;
sensitivity variables needed to reduce the project ERR to 12%, are larger than&#13;
considered likely.&#13;
5.16      Effect of insufficient community participation. The potential&#13;
adverse effects of insufficient community participation would be to lower&#13;
benefits and to raise both OM and investment costs. If the embankments are&#13;
not maintained properly and there is intrusion of saline water, then&#13;
agriculture benefits would fall, the life of the embankments would be shorter&#13;
and benefits from infrastructure protection would be less. If the life of the&#13;
embankments is reduced due to inadequate maintenance, major additional&#13;
expenditure on embankment rehabilitation would be incurred in year 10 and&#13;
again in year 27 after project completion. Major expenditure on embankment&#13;
rehabilitation in year 10 and 27 after project completion (a proxy for the&#13;
cost effects of inadequate maintenance) would reduce the average ERR for the&#13;
11 polders from 19.2% to 17.1%.&#13;
5.17      Effect of implementation delays or overestimation of production&#13;
increases: Implementation delays would defer benefits. Overestimation of&#13;
yields or of the rate of farmer conversion to HYV would also reduce benefits.&#13;
A reduction in the major benefits has been included in the sensitivity&#13;
analysis. Switching values have been calculated at a discount rate of 12% for&#13;
individual benefit items in the NPV/ERR calculations to show the potential&#13;
effect of the risks for each of the 8 polders having estimated ERR on&#13;
quantifiable benefits above 12%. The variables that have been tested in the&#13;
risk and sensitivity analysis include delays in completion of construction and&#13;
decrease in major quantifiable project benefits (agricultural, afforestation,&#13;
and non-agricultural benefits).&#13;
5.18      Table 5.1 shows that to bring the ERR on quantifiable benefits&#13;
below 12% would require a combination of a two year delay in project&#13;
completion and a decrease in project benefits exceeding 30%, or a three year&#13;
delay in project completion and a decrease in project benefits of about 20%.&#13;
Other combinations which would reduce the ERR to 12% would include a two year&#13;
delay in project completion and an increase in O&amp;M costs of over 30%, or a&#13;
three year delay and an increase in O&amp;M costs of about 15%. Such combinations&#13;
of unfavorable developments are considered unlikely. Even then, the&#13;
additional non-quantifyable benefits of saving human lives would still make&#13;
the project worth doing.&#13;

2. Area for khal re-excavation is limited to a spoil dump width of 10 meters on each bank, and acquisition is based&#13;
on aease of 3 years. A third of the required area is allowed and die cost is based on the ruling rte for an ba.&#13;
3. The ara required for resettlernent at polders with the exception of Ramgati and Sandwip is based on accommodating 4&#13;
fmilies per km with a honestead area of 200 sq meters. At Ramgati, to accommodate all the squaters in the portion&#13;
to be resectioned, acquisition of 10 meter wide berm is provided for the full length of the portion. The area&#13;
rquired to accommodate maintenance familes in the new embankment is estimated at 4 farilies per km. In Sandwip all&#13;
squaters located in the first 3.7 km of the embankment to be resectioned (i.e 106 families) would be accommodated&#13;
along the toe of this portion. whilst squaters living on the remaining 3.7 km distant from the town would be located&#13;
in the portions completed under PWP on the basis of 4 families per km.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
COASTAL EMBANKMENT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Community Participation and Role of NGOs&#13;
General&#13;
1.        Objectives.  A community participation approach to afforestation&#13;
and embankment maintenance would be adopted in order to maximize the benefits&#13;
of the project for local disadvantaged groups and in order to provide long&#13;
term low cost O&amp;M of coastal flood control and drainage systems.&#13;
2.        The approach requires the involvement of NGOs who would assist in&#13;
training and supervising landless people in O&amp;M, construction and&#13;
afforestation activities. Specifically, the NGOs would (a) facilitate the&#13;
resettlement of families displaced by project works to the toe of the&#13;
embankment where they would be responsible for routine maintenance and&#13;
afforestation of their allotted sections of embankment, (b) involve landless,&#13;
and particularly female headed households, in routine embankment maintenance&#13;
for the entire length of the selected coastal embankments, irrespective of&#13;
whether rehabilitation works have been carried out, (c) carry out protective&#13;
afforestation of the foreshore, and (d) mobilize local people to take&#13;
advantage of other employment opportunities arising from the project&#13;
(construction works, periodic maintenance, forestry nurseries, agricultural&#13;
and non-farm activities). In addition NGOs would be involved in monitoring&#13;
the land acquisition process and in ensuring the Project Affected Persons&#13;
receive fair and timely compensation. This aspect of NGO activities is&#13;
described in Annex 9 - Resettlement.&#13;
3.        NGO Capabilities and Experience.  There are over 12,000 NGOs&#13;
operating in Bangladesh of which some 150 have been identified by the IDA as&#13;
having development programs for the poor. Their size, capacity and areas of&#13;
expertise diverge greatly. Many NGOs are members of the umbrella&#13;
organization, the Association of Development Agencies in Bangladesh (ADAB),&#13;
which is mandated to improve NGO coordination. ADAB also provides&#13;
secretariats for fora or sub-groups of NGOs working in specific fields. One&#13;
such group is the Forum on Forestry and Environment (the forum), which has&#13;
some 95 members working in the area of community or social forestry.&#13;
4.        The experience of community forestry has been mainly limited to&#13;
arrangements on government-owned lands with bodies such as the railways and&#13;
roads authorities and the BWDB for inland embankments. These lands are leased&#13;
for short periods to the NGOs, who organize and pay groups to plant trees and&#13;
receive a share of the produce upon harvesting. A caretaker from the group is&#13;
paid for by the NGO. The trees are often slow yielding timber species and the&#13;
land remains the property of the government agency, which generally also&#13;
receives part of the harvested produce. An exception to this model occurs in&#13;
the coastal areas where small groups are involved in planting of palms on land&#13;
around cyclone shelter sites, often donated by the community. There has been&#13;
no experience to date of the private lease-type arrangements proposed for this&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-                             ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
5.        The NGOs with the most experience in the forestry sector include&#13;
Proshika (which has worked with winrock International in developing community&#13;
forestry training modules), Dinajpur and Rangpur Development Scheme (who have&#13;
a well established and successful social forestry programme in north-western&#13;
Bangladesh), and BRAC (who have experience in the planting of mulberry trees&#13;
for sericulture on road and river embankments). In addition, POUSH, CARITAS,&#13;
MCC (Mennonite Central Committee), CARE and CONCERN have been involved in&#13;
social forestry along roads and railways lines.&#13;
6.        At least 40 NGOs are working in the 21 polders covered by this&#13;
project. They are largely involved in emergency relief, building and&#13;
maintenance of cyclone protection shelters and land reform. There is a&#13;
growing experience through programs such as the SRP, and through NGOs' own&#13;
Land Reform Programs, in working with landless women to form Earthworks&#13;
Maintenance Groups (EMGs) to carry out routine embankment maintenance for&#13;
BWDB, and in forming Landless Contracting Societies (LCSs) for road building&#13;
and maintenance. Many NGOs are also involved in social forestry programs,&#13;
although these do not appear to involve afforestation of coastal embankments.&#13;
One NGO (Oiskar International) is believed to be active in community planting&#13;
of mangroves.&#13;
7.        Interest of NGOs.  Based on discussions between the mission, ADAB&#13;
and individual NGOs at the national and the local level, there appears to be&#13;
general support for the approach of the project. In particular many NGOs&#13;
welcomed the opportunity to transform a major infrastructure project into an&#13;
opportunity to use a scarce land resource for resettlement of vulnerable&#13;
landless groups and to treat embankments as income earning assets. All of the&#13;
NGOs consulted expressed an interest in participating in activities ranging&#13;
from project design to implementation and monitoring. NGOs wish to be&#13;
considered as partners, rather than simply contractors, in the project,&#13;
actively involved from the outset of project implementation in discussions on&#13;
the preparation of proforma contracts and consideration of proposals for&#13;
implementation of the project. NGOs stressed that they would prefer to work&#13;
in areas where they are already established, which highlights the need to&#13;
identify locally active NGOs to be included on the shortlist of NGOs to be&#13;
invited to provide services.&#13;
Activities for Community Participation&#13;
8.        Areas in which community participation would occur are:&#13;
(a) Routine embankment maintenance;&#13;
(b)  Foreshore afforestation;&#13;
(c) Embankment afforestation; and&#13;
(d) Periodic embankment maintenance.&#13;
9.        Routine Earthwork Maintenance would be carried out on the total&#13;
length of embankments rehabilitated and improved under CERP and PWP and&#13;
limited sections of non-rehabilitated embankments unimpeded by human&#13;
settlements and plantations (see para 13 (b)). Routine O&amp;M and planting and&#13;
management of trees on the rehabilitated embankments would be carried out on&#13;
about 530 km of embankment by squatter and other selected landless households,&#13;
with priority given to those affected by the project. The selected landless&#13;
families would be resettled at the toe of the embankment and would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64 -                            ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
responsible for the maintenance of a specific strip corresponding to the&#13;
length of embankment on which they would have the usufructuary rights for the&#13;
trees. This is expected to be about one hectare (approximately 250m-300m&#13;
depending on the height and width specifications of the embankment). In&#13;
portions of Sandwip and Ramgati, due to the high density of squatters on&#13;
embankments, they would be organized in groups of about 5-10 families, with&#13;
each group being allotted a 1 ha section of embankment. Families would have a&#13;
contract with BWDB and receive direct payment for the first 4 years of&#13;
operation (from the first year of settlement) at a declining rate as the&#13;
produce of the trees on the embankment increases.1 Failure to meet their O&amp;M&#13;
and afforestation responsibilities would lead to sanctions, including in the&#13;
worst cases, eviction and resettlement of new families on the homestead plot.&#13;
After a period of 4 years the families would continue to carry out routine O&amp;M&#13;
but would no longer receive payment (except that if the embankment trees are&#13;
destroyed in a future cyclone, payment would resume until sufficient&#13;
subsistence income could be obtained from the trees.) It has been calculated&#13;
that about 1,800 families, plus about 30 groups of 5-10 families each in&#13;
Sandwip and Ramgati, would be resettled in this way.&#13;
10.       Foreshore Afforestation.  Afforestation would be carried out on&#13;
some 4,700 ha of the foreshore by groups of local people trained and&#13;
supervised by NGOs. Mangroves would be planted on low lying foreshore areas,&#13;
while other species (see Annex 4) have been identified for higher foreshore&#13;
areas. Foreshore afforestation would be phased and would be carried out from&#13;
year 1 of the project, before the completion of construction works. Planting&#13;
would be carried out in the months of June to August, with mangroves also&#13;
being planted in December to February. It is expected that groups would have&#13;
an average of about 15 members who would plant some 12 ha (equivalent to an&#13;
0.8 km strip of 100 m or a 1.6 km strip of 50 m)2 However different NGOs&#13;
would be permitted to use larger or smaller group sizes based on their&#13;
experience and preferences. Replacement of failed seedling would be carried&#13;
out in the subsequent 2 years. This implies that NGOs and FD would need to&#13;
mobilize some 400 groups for foreshore afforestation over the whole project&#13;
area. Average earnings of group members, on the basis of a Tk 60 day rate,&#13;
are estimated at Tk 3,600 per season, equivalent to earnings from agricultural&#13;
labor. For the publicly owned areas to be afforested (expected to be most of&#13;
the foreshore afforestation program) protection of foreshore forests would be&#13;
the responsibility of the community. Distribution of benefits from&#13;
harvesting, carried out from year 8 onwards, under the supervision of the FD,&#13;
would be the responsibility of the community.&#13;
11.       Embankment Afforestation would be carried out by resettled&#13;
households. A combination of timber, fuelwood, fruit and other species, such&#13;
as grasses, would be provided gratis to families from nurseries established in&#13;
collaboration with the FD. Such families would also be supplied with&#13;
fertilizer and pesticides during the first three years of afforestation.&#13;
Trained field officers of the NGOs would assist beneficiaries in preparing a&#13;
1.    Details of payment rates are in Annex 5, para 17.&#13;
2.    Based on the assumption of 3,000 seedlings per hectare, with an average&#13;
labor input of 75 person-days per hectare, for a five day week over a&#13;
three month season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 4 of 11&#13;
planting strategy which is appropriate to embankment protection, provide a&#13;
steady subsistence income from year 5 onwards and meet fuelwood, fodder and&#13;
survival needs. Training in planting, maintenance, harvesting and marketing&#13;
would be provided to groups of households. Protection of tree crops would be&#13;
individual household's responsibility with the support of the local project&#13;
coordination committee.&#13;
12.       Periodic Embankment Maintenance. Re-excavation of Khals and the&#13;
Periodic Maintenance of Khals. Periodic embankment maintenance would consist&#13;
of earthwork in resectioning to bring the embankment to design profile,&#13;
repairs of earth slips, grassing of slopes, etc. The re-excavation of khals,&#13;
which is included as a rehabilitation and improvement work, would consist of&#13;
removal of water hyacinth, clearing debris and man made obstructions, and&#13;
earthwork excavation in bringing the khal to its designed profile and bed&#13;
level. The periodic maintenance of khals, which is estimated to be carried&#13;
out once every two years, would consist of removal of water hyacinth, clearing&#13;
of debris and man-made obstructions, and desilting to the designed bed level&#13;
and bed width. The periodic maintenance activities on embankments would be&#13;
carried out on about 770 km. About 390 km of khals are to be re-excavated&#13;
under the rehabilitation and improvement program, and the work is expected to&#13;
be carried out under the Food For Work Program. These khals are also included&#13;
under the routine and periodic maintenance program. Whilst the routine&#13;
maintenance of embankments being rehabilitated and improved under the project&#13;
are provided for, the project does not expect routine maintenance of&#13;
embankments to be carried out in most of the 230 km of embankments where no&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement works are proposed under the project.&#13;
Conditions prevailing in these embankments (extensive human settlements and&#13;
plantations) do not permit an organized and effective method to carry out&#13;
routine maintenance. However, the periodic maintenance program would ensure&#13;
the safety and security of the embankment. In addition, where conditions&#13;
permit, funds from the periodic maintenance program could be utilized to carry&#13;
out routine maintenance. During the project period, BWDB and project&#13;
consultants would identify sections of khals requiring routine maintenance,&#13;
and also the sections of embankment where no rehabilitation and improvement&#13;
works are included in CERP and PWP where routine maintenance is possible.&#13;
These sections would be contracted out to Earthwork Maintenance Groups as&#13;
detailed in para 13(b). Wherever possible periodic maintenance work would be&#13;
awarded to Landless Contracting Societies (LCSs) for a guaranteed minimum wage&#13;
rate, comparable with Food For Work rates for a fixed amount of work.&#13;
Alternatively, such work could be awarded through NCB procedures.&#13;
13.       Minimum contract size for major construction works would preclude&#13;
Landless Contracting Societies from being awarded contracts directly by BWDB,&#13;
but it is anticipated that international and local contractors would budget&#13;
some 10% of overall contracts for local manual labor, implying an average&#13;
local labor demand of at least 100 labor-days per km over a 3 month&#13;
construction period. It is anticipated that a total of about 60 LCS would be&#13;
formed for periodic maintenance work.&#13;
Models for Community Participation. Three basic models for community&#13;
participation are proposed.&#13;
(a) Resettled Households would have individual contracts which allow&#13;
settlement on a 10 m by 20 m homestead plot on the toe of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66 -                             ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 5 of 11&#13;
embankment and the usufructuary rights of the trees that they plant&#13;
on the embankment. Resettlers would receive a cash payment for&#13;
relocation expenses and payment in kind of materials for building&#13;
of a katcha house on the homestead plot. The length of the&#13;
contract for settlement at the homestead should be based on the&#13;
lifetime of the embankment which, with the exception of river&#13;
sections prone to erosion which may require future realignment, is&#13;
expected to be at least 30 years. In the event of retirement, the&#13;
lease holders would be resettled on the toe of the new embankment&#13;
and would receive a similar package of assistance to the original.&#13;
The contract would be between the household and the BWDB and it&#13;
must be clearly understood that rights of abode would be tied to&#13;
the performance of O&amp;M services. In order to reduce risk of&#13;
seasonal migration of males and non-performance of O&amp;M duties and&#13;
evictions, it may be appropriate to assign the contract to the&#13;
female head of the family.&#13;
(b)  Earthwork Maintenance Groups (EMGs) for embankments and khals would&#13;
have direct annual contracts with the BWDB for: (i) sections of&#13;
embankments (limited to sections unimpeded by human settlement and&#13;
plantations and identified by BWDB and project consultants) where&#13;
no rehabilitation and improvement works have been carried out; and&#13;
(b) sections of khals requiring regular clearing operations to&#13;
facilitate rapid drainage. Preference for membership to these&#13;
groups would be given to landless households, and particularly&#13;
female headed households, living close to the embankment. EMGs&#13;
would typically have about 25 members with an elected chairperson&#13;
and secretary. Maintenance responsibilities would be throughout&#13;
the year based on a renewable annual contract (estimated value of&#13;
Tk 15,600 per km/pa) paid directly to the group's bank account.&#13;
Two signatories would be required for withdrawals. BWDB would&#13;
continue to pay for such routine maintenance services after IDA has&#13;
withdrawn from the project. Currently EMGs established for the SRP&#13;
and Early Implementation Project do not have legal entity but are&#13;
organized and certified by NGOs.&#13;
Some of the existing EMGs have a compulsory group savings scheme&#13;
whereby 10W (Tk 3 per day) of the wages is saved for group or&#13;
individual projects. NGOs should discuss this approach with&#13;
members in order to generate savings for other income generating&#13;
projects such as livestock, horticulture, cottage industries,&#13;
nurseries and afforestation contracts on unsettled sections of the&#13;
embankment.&#13;
(c)  Landless Contracting Societies (LCSs) would be established by the&#13;
NGOs in order to carry out foreshore afforestation, some earthworks&#13;
during resectioning and appropriate periodic maintenance work.&#13;
During the construction period preference would be given to&#13;
households resettled on the toe of the embankment, who would not&#13;
yet be able to plant on the embankment or their homesteads.&#13;
Landless Contracting Societies would be registered by NGOs who&#13;
would assist in the necessary paperwork for the contracting process&#13;
with the BWDB. Since the groups do not have their own legal&#13;
entity, it is suggested that, if they wish, NGOs assist both EMGs&#13;
&#13;

ensure sustainability after the expiry of the contract between BWDB&#13;
and the NGOs.&#13;
Collaborative Framework&#13;
14.       Scope of NGO activities.  Terms of Reference for the NGOs would be&#13;
prepared by BWDB and FD in agreement with IDA and EU missions and in close&#13;
collaboration with the ADAB forum on forestry and environment. The main&#13;
activities are expected to include the following:&#13;
(a)      Planning of embankment afforestation and maintenance and foreshore&#13;
afforestation. NGO staff would visit project polders to explain&#13;
the project concept, mobilize support for the project, assess the&#13;
interest and attitudes of local people towards participating in the&#13;
programme, and identify suitable participants. Together with&#13;
forestry experts and local people, an appropriate mix of trees&#13;
species would be identified, taking account of the requirements of&#13;
BWDB for trees suitable for planting on an embankment. The NGOs&#13;
would assist FD in delineating areas of foreshore suitable for&#13;
planting. Based on this preliminary work, NGOs would formulate a&#13;
plp-n for discus,.on and approval in the PIU and FPIU.  Following&#13;
approval, NGOs would mobilize project participants and initiate&#13;
forestry activities.&#13;
(b)      I=mlementation of embankment forestrv.  Assist embankment settlers&#13;
(ES) to occupy homestead plots allocated in the Resettlement Action&#13;
Plan, and in negotiating contracts with BWDB. In conjunction with&#13;
the FD, provide appropriate advice on planting schemes and methods.&#13;
Supply each settler with tree seedlings, hedge seeds, fertilizers,&#13;
stakes and pesticides. Together with local FD staff, provide&#13;
advice and any training required on planting methods, and ensure&#13;
trees are correctly planted. After planting, monitor survival and&#13;
growth of trees, and provide any advice required. Continue to&#13;
provide fertilizer and pesticides, and replace any seedlings that&#13;
die, for a three year period.&#13;
(c)      SuPDlV of tree seedlings.  At the start of the project, in&#13;
conjunction with the FD, identify existing supplies of tree&#13;
seedlings and calculate what additional supplies, if any, would be&#13;
needed for both the embankment and the foreshore. In conjunction&#13;
with the FD, formulate a plan to expand seedling production, with&#13;
FD taking the lead in mangrove seedlings, and the NGO organizing&#13;
production of other species, preferably by supporting nurseries run&#13;
by landless and poor people.&#13;
(d)      ImDlementation of foreshore forestry.  Organize people (with&#13;
preference for the landless/poor) into Foreshore Forestry Groups&#13;
(FFG). If group members wish, assist them in registering as a LCS.&#13;
Supply seedlings and other input materials and, together with the&#13;
FD, provide technical advice and training. Monitor the survival&#13;
rate of seedling and organize replacement planting as well as&#13;
weeding and other maintenance activities. Pay foreshore groups&#13;
(from funds provided by FD) at agreed rates for planting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 7 of 11&#13;
(e)      Forest protection.  Motivate and organize communities to protect&#13;
both newly planted and existing areas of foreshore forest. Assist&#13;
groups in negotiating a share of firewood and poles produced in&#13;
these forests.&#13;
(f)      Routine maintenance of rehabilitated embankments.  Provide advice&#13;
to ES on the routine maintenance of embankments and assist them in&#13;
maintaining exclusive occupation of their leased sections. Certify&#13;
to BWDB the quality of the work carried out as the basis for&#13;
payments to ES from BWDB. Monitor these payments and level of&#13;
income from tree crops and homestead plots. Recommend appropriate&#13;
sanctions for inadequate performance of responsibilities, including&#13;
eviction as a last resort.&#13;
(g)      Routine maintenance of sections of existincq embankments and khals.&#13;
Organize groups of landless people in EMGs to contract with BWDB to&#13;
provide routine maintenance of khals and identified sections of&#13;
embankment that are not rehabilitated or afforested by the project.&#13;
Give training to group leaders in earthwork methods, group&#13;
organization, basic accounting and tendering procedures. Assist in&#13;
negotiations with BWDB, and monitor payments to the group from&#13;
BWDB. Assist in setting up a group bank account. Provide, on a&#13;
credit basis, any hand tools the group may require.&#13;
(h)      Periodic embankment and khal maintenance.  Organize groups of&#13;
landless people as LCS to carry out contracts given by BWDB for&#13;
periodic maintenance work on embankments. Give training to group&#13;
leaders in earthwork methods, group organization, basic accounting&#13;
and tendering procedures. Assist in negotiations with BWDB, and&#13;
monitor payments to the group from BWDB. Assist in setting up a&#13;
group bank account. Provide, on a credit basis, any hand tools the&#13;
group may require.&#13;
(i)      Homestead Dlots.  Provide assistance to ES in making productive use&#13;
of homestead plots, and in developing other sources of income that&#13;
are compatible with the good maintenance of the embankment and&#13;
trees.&#13;
(j)      Submit proposals to the PIU for use of a Community Development Fund&#13;
provided by the project and implement approved activities. The&#13;
Community Development Fund would provide resources to implement&#13;
supporting poverty alleviation activities aimed at strengthening&#13;
project operation and group cohesion. This may involve water&#13;
supplies and sanitary facilities for embankment settlers, training&#13;
and education programmes, and income generating activities. The&#13;
latter could in particular aim at processing and marketing of&#13;
project outputs such as coconuts. The fund may also be used to&#13;
provide credit for the purchase of hand tools by EMG/LCS.&#13;
(j)      Participate in Prolect Coordinating Committees at the polder level&#13;
and elect representatives to participate at district and national&#13;
levels.&#13;
&#13;

Page 8 of 11&#13;
*(k)     Community suDDort.  Hold discussions with the Union Parishad and&#13;
other members of the community to build wide support for the&#13;
project, and to establish the importance of embankment maintenance,&#13;
sustained embankment and foreshore forestry, and prevention of&#13;
encroachment onto embankments by housing and cultivation. Build&#13;
community respect for the importance of protection of embankment&#13;
and foreshore forestry, and ensure that forest products accrue to&#13;
ES and members of foreshore forestry groups.&#13;
Contracts with NGOs for embankment maintenance and afforestation would be&#13;
signed by BWDB, while contracts for foreshore afforestation and organizing&#13;
production of non-mangrove seedlings would be signed by FD. BWDB and FD would&#13;
make maximum efforts to select the same NGOs in each polder.&#13;
15.       Discussions between implementing agencies, prospective NGOs, the&#13;
forestry and environment forum of ADAB, IDA/EU resident missions and the&#13;
consultants may result in some adjustments in the plan for the work, such as&#13;
changes in the appropriate size of groups. Further adjustments could take&#13;
place following the mid-term reviews.&#13;
16.       An attempt is being made to arrange to carry out pilot projects in&#13;
afforestation in four trial areas from 1995. Given the time constraints&#13;
involved it is likely that NGOs for the pilot activities would be employed as&#13;
sub-contractors to the project consultants.&#13;
selection. Coordination and Monitoring of NGOs&#13;
17.       Selection of NGOs.  Given the diversity of activities in which NGOs&#13;
would be involved (mobilization, organization of groups and individuals for&#13;
O&amp;M, afforestation and tree maintenance) and the diversity of coastal areas&#13;
and conditions, it is anticipated a separate contract would be required for&#13;
each polder. It would be highly advantageous for BWDB and FD to select the&#13;
same NGO in a particular polder. Given the large number of NGOs involved,&#13;
standardization of contracts and coordination would be required to guarantee&#13;
quality and continuity of services provided.&#13;
18.       Surveys for the resettlement plan have furnished a list of active&#13;
NGOs by polders. From this, and other information that ADAB may provide, and&#13;
consultation with the polder level coordinating committees headed by the Union&#13;
Parishad Chairmen, a short list would be compiled and NGOs would be invited to&#13;
submit proposals for providing services for specific polders. The proposed&#13;
selections would be made by a joint BWDB/FD Committee subject to approval by&#13;
the PIU and the FPIU, and whatever higher level approvals may be required.&#13;
Selection would be made on the basis of the following criteria:&#13;
(a)      several years of experience of working in the coastal area,&#13;
especially in the specific project polders;&#13;
(b)      proven management and implementation ability, particularly for&#13;
field staff in remote areas;&#13;
(c)      experience in mobilization, group formation and organization of the&#13;
landless;&#13;
&#13;

Page 9 of 11&#13;
(d)      experience in implementation of social forestry projects;&#13;
(e)      experience in organization of EWG or LCS for public works&#13;
activities; and&#13;
(f)      pragmatic approach shown through a willingness to work with local&#13;
government representatives (Union Parishad), local elites, and&#13;
government implementing agencies;&#13;
19.       Ideally the polder level coordinating committees headed by the&#13;
Union Parishad Chairmen would review the NGO proposals and send their&#13;
recommendations to the PIU and FPIU, who would review them to ensure that they&#13;
were appropriately based on the selection criteria and that the total&#13;
selections of a particular NGO by the various Union's did not exceed that&#13;
NGO's implementation capacity. In making the selection, a cross section of&#13;
local representatives including members of the target group, Union Parishad&#13;
members, and staff of other development agencies should also be consulted to&#13;
verify the record and suitability of the NGO for the specific area. The&#13;
proposed selections would be subject to IDA/EU review and a statement of no&#13;
objection.&#13;
Staff Requirements&#13;
20.       NGOs would utilize full time field workers and supervisors to work&#13;
exclusively on the project. For calculation purposes it is assumed that there&#13;
would be one field worker per 8 EMGs/LCS, one worker per 10 foreshore forestry&#13;
groups, and one field worker per 30 ES during the period of embankment&#13;
afforestation, reducing to one per 50 ES once trees are established.&#13;
Individual NGOs may choose to vary group size and number of groups covered by&#13;
a field worker based, on their experience and preferences. ES may be&#13;
organized into groups of 10 to 15 for mutual support, and to facilitate&#13;
supervision and training. There would be an average of about one supervisor&#13;
per five field workers. Attachment 1 shows the anticipated NGO staff&#13;
requirements relative to project embankment maintenance and forestry&#13;
activities, on these assumptions. NGO staff numbers for all polders would&#13;
total about 140. In addition each NGO would appoint a Project Director from&#13;
amongst its senior staff at a regional or national headquarters level. The&#13;
NGO's Project Director would be responsible, on a part time basis, for the&#13;
overall direction of the NGO's activities, and for contractual matters.&#13;
21.       Management and Coordination.  Within each polder the NGO's senior&#13;
field supervisor would be responsible for NGO activities, and would coordinate&#13;
with local BWDB and FD staff. The NGO supervisors would report to the BWDB&#13;
zonal XEN (O&amp;M) and to the CERP ACF in the FD who would be responsible for O&amp;M&#13;
and forestry activities for a group of polders. NGOs would draw up, for&#13;
approval by the PIU/FPIU, a detailed work plan for a three year period,&#13;
together with cost budgets. The plan would be updated annually. The project&#13;
consultants would recruit four Community Development Officers, who would be&#13;
based at a zonal level, together with a Community Development Advisor based in&#13;
the PIU. They would assist NGOs in their relations with BWDB and FD, arrange&#13;
for NGO staff training, and provide overall communication and coordination&#13;
between project NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 10 of 11&#13;
22.       RePresentation.  NGOs would be represented on committees with the&#13;
implementing agencies and consultants at a number of levels.  A senior member&#13;
of the NGO community, elected by the NGOs involved in the project, would sit&#13;
on the Project Coordinating Committee. An elected representative of the NGOs&#13;
operating in the polders would sit on each of the District Project&#13;
Coordinating Committees. At the local level the senior field supervisor of&#13;
the NGO at the polder level would be a member of the Local Coordinating&#13;
Committee.&#13;
23.       MonitorinQ and Evaluation.  The PIU/FPIU and consultants would&#13;
carry out routine monitoring of NGO activities. A simple monthly reporting&#13;
system for each polder would feed into a computerized MIS. In addition a&#13;
separate firm of consultants would be contracted to carry out annual sample&#13;
surveys of beneficiaries. If an NGO fails to meet the terms of its contract&#13;
then the contract would be terminated and another organization would be&#13;
sought.&#13;
Timing and CoveraQe of Pronosed Actions&#13;
24.       Solicitation of NGO participation should be initiated in June 1995,&#13;
on the basis of an agreed terms of reference prepared by BWDB and FD, with&#13;
advice and assistance from the World Bank resident mission, EU Consultants of&#13;
the PWP and the ADAB forum. Contracts should be negotiated and signed for NGO&#13;
participation in all 21 polders covered by the project by December 1995.&#13;
25.       Improved O&amp;M would be introduced on a gradual basis from the first&#13;
project year in about 300 km of CERP embankment where no rehabilitation works&#13;
are proposed, and on completed PWP embankments. Full coverage would be&#13;
reached by year four, after rehabilitation has been completed and the one-year&#13;
maintenance period by contractors has expired. Foreshore afforestation may&#13;
also start on 4700 ha of foreshore and PWP embankments from project year one.&#13;
Afforestation of CERP embankments can take place from project year two or&#13;
three and would be completed by year four.&#13;
26.       An attempt is being made to organize a pilot afforestation&#13;
programme in 1995 in four selected polders where priority works have already&#13;
been completed. Each pilot area would consist of a 2.5 km strip and would&#13;
involve the following activities:&#13;
(a) selection of a different NGO in each area for mobilization and&#13;
organization of project participants;&#13;
(b) resettlement of 10 squatter or displaced households per trial area&#13;
in order to give each a 1 ha plot of embankment;&#13;
(c) selection of tree species in collaboration with consultants, FD,&#13;
BWDB and beneficiaries based on agro-ecological conditions and&#13;
economic needs;&#13;
(d) seedlings for pilot planting would be purchased from existing FD,&#13;
NGO and private nurseries. In addition two nurseries (one&#13;
mangrove, one for upland trees) would be established in each area&#13;
to produce seedlings for planting in subsequent years;&#13;
&#13;

(f)  mobilization of three or four groups of about 10 members for&#13;
foreshore afforestation of a 30 ha strip in front of the embankment&#13;
with training and seedlings provided by FD.&#13;
27.       Continual monitoring of the pilot areas would be carried out by the&#13;
PIU and consultant Community Development Adviser and the model for community&#13;
participation would be adapted according to the lessons learned. In addition&#13;
small strips would be selected in each of the trial areas in order to test the&#13;
suitability of vetiver grass for embankment stabilization in different&#13;
conditions.&#13;
28.       Funding: Services provided by the NGOs for community mobilization&#13;
and participation would be financed by the EU for the seven years of the&#13;
project. Payments for routine and periodic O&amp;M would be financed by the BWDB&#13;
with reimbursement on a declining scale under the IDA credit. Full costs&#13;
would be covered under the GOB budget after credit completion. Provision of&#13;
seedlings for afforestation on the foreshore and embankments, together with&#13;
fertilizer and pesticides for the first three years of afforestation and&#13;
payments for foreshore planting work would be covered by the EU grant.&#13;

COASTAL EMBANKMENT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Forestry Models&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.          Afforestation of embankment slopes and a belt on the foreshore&#13;
would reduce cyclone damage and embankment operation and maintenance (O&amp;M)&#13;
costs. The coastal embankments are submerged up to a fair depth during normal&#13;
tides, with greater submersion occurring during spring tides and cyclones.&#13;
The eroding actions by the sea waves and cyclone surges cause constant&#13;
scouring of the embankment base and slopes resulting in damage or, at times,&#13;
breaches in the embankment. However, it has been observed that wherever&#13;
groves of standing trees exist on the foreshore, such damage is minimal. The&#13;
trees, acting as a physical barrier, directly intercept the waves and storm&#13;
surges and reduce their speed and erosive action. A belt of standing trees of&#13;
appreciable width along the coastline functions as a wall absorbing and&#13;
dissipating the first onslaught of storm surges and provides protection of the&#13;
embankment as well as lives and property of the people living in the area.&#13;
Also, trees of appropriate species planted on the embankment help hold the&#13;
embankment soil firmly through their root network. Finally, as a last resort,&#13;
many people in the affected area survived cyclones clinging to the top of&#13;
appropriate tree species (without thorns and able to bend in the wind). In&#13;
addition to reducing cyclone damage and embankment O&amp;M costs, the trees would&#13;
provide direct economic benefits in terms of their produce and would produce&#13;
environmental benefits. The foreshore afforestation would also accelerate&#13;
accretion of new land.&#13;
2.          The proposed area for afforestation consists of embankment slopes&#13;
and a 50 to 200 meter wide strip of foreshore (depending on land suitability&#13;
and availability) of the 21 polders included in the project. Total length of&#13;
embankment available for afforestation is about 575 km, covering an area of&#13;
about 1900 hectares on the slopes. On the foreshore, a length of about 440&#13;
km, covering an area of approximately 4,700 hectares, would be available for&#13;
afforestation. (Details of length and area by polder for the embankment slope&#13;
and the foreshore are given in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.) In addition, an&#13;
area of 30 hectares out of about 35 hectares provided as homestead land for&#13;
the participants in embankment maintenance would be available for planting&#13;
trees or growing crops. Foreshore land, according to a BWDB survey (which&#13;
covered 20 out of the 21 CERP polders), includes 1,090 ha in the inter-tidal&#13;
zone and almost 11,000 ha of raised foreshore between the high tide mark and&#13;
embankment alignment. About half of the raised foreshore is privately owned&#13;
and used for cropping. There are limited areas of trees, homesteads, shrimp&#13;
pond and salt pans, but most of the remaining raised foreshore is&#13;
uncultivated. It is assumed that all the inter-tidal zone would be planted to&#13;
mangrove.   The area of raised foreshore available for planting has been&#13;
assumed to be 80% of publicly owned, non-used land, and 20% of private and&#13;
cropped land. The Forest Department (FD) has a very successful afforestation&#13;
project on an island near Polder 48 which shows that afforestation is possible&#13;
in the coastal areas as long as appropriate tree species (especially those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 11&#13;
with some tolerance of salt) are selected. Planned phasing of embankment and&#13;
foreshore afforestation is given in Tables 3 and 4 respectively.&#13;
B. Imvlementation Concept&#13;
3.          A community participation approach is proposed for dealing with&#13;
the issues of afforestation and routine embankment maintenance. Families, now&#13;
squatting on embankments to be resectioned by the project, and other landless&#13;
families would be settled (to the extent of available area) on the toe of the&#13;
embankment on the inland side. They would be given contracts allowing them to&#13;
reside on this allotment and the rights to the produce of the trees on a given&#13;
section of the embankment (of about 1 ha.) in return for providing routine&#13;
maintenance and care of trees on this section. They would be paid for their&#13;
embankment maintenance activities by Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB)&#13;
until the trees had grown sufficiently to provide adequate income, but the&#13;
payments would be gradually reduced and eventually eliminated as the income&#13;
from the trees increased. They would also be provided seedlings, technical&#13;
assistance in planting and maintaining approved species, and fertilizer and&#13;
pesticides for the first three years after planting. In areas where&#13;
sufficient land in the foreshore is Government owned, groups of landless&#13;
people would be paid to plant appropriate species over a period of four years.&#13;
Thereafter community groups would provide the small amounts of labor required&#13;
to maintain and protect these forests, motivated both by the protection&#13;
provided by these forests to the community as well as the rights to the&#13;
produce of these forests. NGOs active in the respective project areas would&#13;
be employed to mobilize and organize local people to participate in the&#13;
project and to provide training in tree planting and maintenance and routine&#13;
embankment maintenance. BWDB and FD would provide necessary technical&#13;
training to NGO staff and possibly directly to community participants. In&#13;
areas where the foreshore is privately owned, owners would be encouraged to&#13;
grow trees on 50-200 m strips along the shoreline (which are in most cases&#13;
unsuitable for other crops). The project would plant the seedlings at no&#13;
charge to the landowners, in return for the landowners' agreement to maintain&#13;
the area under trees. The agreement would also provide that the landowners&#13;
would receive in the case of any land now used for crop production, the value&#13;
of the income foregone from crop production until income from the trees is&#13;
available (about 8 years). The agreement would permit landowners to use&#13;
forest products according to sound forestry practices, with landowner&#13;
obligated to replant trees in areas of harvesting. The community&#13;
participation effort would be supervised and encouraged by local committees&#13;
headed by the Union Parishad Chairman anu including representatives of the&#13;
local NGOs, and BWDB and FD local staff and a representative of the&#13;
consultants.&#13;
C. Plantation Models&#13;
(i) Selection of Tree Species&#13;
4.          Plantation models have been developed for the embankment slopes,&#13;
foreshore, and homestead. Figure 1 shows the model for the slopes and&#13;
foreshore while Figure 2 shows the model for the homestead. These models&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-                            ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
include a wide range of species to allow flexibility in selecting species to&#13;
be grown in a given area. Guidelines for spacings and planting arrangements&#13;
are given in the following sections.&#13;
5.          Models for embankment slope afforestation take account of the need&#13;
for species which are resistant to cyclonic winds and (on the outer slope)&#13;
salinity, have root structures that will strengthen the embankment, and which&#13;
would produce adequate income. Within these constraints, those allotted&#13;
sections of the embankment would be allowed some choice of species in response&#13;
to personal preferences and local market opportunities. Since the target&#13;
group to be involved in routine embankment maintenance are mostly poor people,&#13;
the selection of trees to be planted on the embankment slopes has been&#13;
designed to generate quick returns from the plantation for the people's&#13;
subsistence. A combination of fruit trees that yield in the short term and&#13;
those that yield in the long term as well as timber trees have been selected.&#13;
Quick growing fuelwood species have also been included in the models since the&#13;
supply of firewood is inadequate in the area. Arhar or vetiver grass 1 hedge&#13;
rows would be planted along the crest of the embankment due to their advantage&#13;
as soil binders. Arhar also produces an edible pulse. The models take&#13;
account of the need for spacing of the trees to permit sunlight to reach the&#13;
embankment slopes, so that grass or other undergrowth is maintained. Planting&#13;
of annual crops that require tilling the slopes would be prohibited because&#13;
such action would loosen the soils and contribute to erosion. Growing of&#13;
bananas and papaya would also be prohibited because on harvest or natural&#13;
death of the plant, the rotting of the herbaceous stem and roots create holes&#13;
and subsequent breaches in the embankment that take place from hollowing.&#13;
options for suitable species for the foreshore take into consideration&#13;
variations in soils and tidal conditions.&#13;
(ii) Model I: Embankment SloDes&#13;
6.          A typical height of the embankment would be about four meters 2&#13;
and the inner slope (country side) would have a gradient of 1:3. The inner&#13;
slope available for tree planting would thus be about 12 meters. Two rows of&#13;
palms would be planted on the inner slope, the first row running 1 m below the&#13;
crest of the embankment and the second row running along the foot of the&#13;
embankment. In the top row date palms would be spaced at lOm with a betelnut&#13;
palm planted between the dates. In the bottom row coconuts would be spaced at&#13;
lOm with two betelnuts between each pair of coconuts. Between the two rows of&#13;
palms one row of fruit trees would be planted, that would bear fruit in two to&#13;
three years (such as guava, lemon, kul, and sharifa). The spacing between the&#13;
fruit trees should be such that sunlight reaches the ground to allow growth of&#13;
grass. A few calms of bamboo may be planted along the toe of the embankment,&#13;
in the outmost periphery. Since the height of the embankment is variable, the&#13;
1.    Vetiver will be grown on an experimental basis initially in five areas,&#13;
one km. rows on both sides of the crest.   Depending on the results,&#13;
vetiver or other hedge row species would be used in the general model.&#13;
2.    Designed crest level less distance of the base above sea level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-77-                            ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
row to row distance of the palm and fruit trees would vary at different&#13;
locations.&#13;
7.          A typical outer slope (sea facing) would have a gradient of 1:7.&#13;
Given the typical embankment height of 4m, the slope would have an width of&#13;
28.8m available for afforestation. The outer slope would have four rows of&#13;
palms with, between the palm rows, four rows of timber trees. The first row&#13;
of palms would be im below the crest width with a lOm space to the second row&#13;
of palms. These two rows would comprise of alternate coconut and date palm at&#13;
a Sm spacing. The third row of palms would be positioned at 8m from the&#13;
second row of palms, with the last palm row a further 8m distant. The third&#13;
and forth palm rows would be planted with alternate date and palmyra palms at&#13;
a spacing of 5 m. The intervening space between the palm rows would be&#13;
planted with timber species with a plant to plant distance of 2 m. Timber&#13;
species would include koroi, shisoo, babul, khair, khoya babla, mahogany, etc.&#13;
As embankment height is variable, the number of rows of plants will also vary&#13;
at different locations.&#13;
8.          In order to prevent scouring of the embankment berm by sea waves,&#13;
a 2m wide strip (lm along the slope and lm flat berm) should be planted with&#13;
dholkolmi, shada akand, keya, golpata, and other suitable species. The&#13;
planting would be done by cuttings, either directly planted into the ground or&#13;
grown in polypots, at a spacing of lm x lm.&#13;
9.           Two rows each of arhar and ipil-ipil would be grown in dense&#13;
line, along the embankment length, to function as protective hedges. The&#13;
arhar rows would run O.5m below the crest width, on both sides, and the ipil-&#13;
ipil rows would run along the toe of the embankment, above the submersion&#13;
level, on the outer slope. Ipil-ipil is likely to reach a considerable height&#13;
in one growing season and so may blow over. Therefore it would need to be&#13;
regularly cut to a height of l.5m, producing a substantial quantity of&#13;
fuelwood and fodder. Arhar will produce an edible pulse and fuelwood.&#13;
Depending on the results of experiments, vetiver may replace arhar in some&#13;
locations.&#13;
(iii) Model II: Foreshore&#13;
10.         Raised foreshore areas with clay soils would be planted with&#13;
species such as raintree, koroi, khoya babla, simul, and kadam, grown in&#13;
polypots. Sandy soil and sand dune areas would be primarily planted with&#13;
jhaw, but other species like eucalyptus camaldulensis and khoya babla would be&#13;
tried in areas where some proportion of clay is observed. The plant spacing&#13;
would be 2 m x 2 m. The low lying inter-tidal areas (mud flats) would be&#13;
planted with mangrove species at a spacing of 1.5 m x 1.5 m. The choice of&#13;
species would depend on the maturity of the formations and physical&#13;
characteristics of the topsoil. While new formations would be planted with&#13;
keora, the comparatively harder soils would be planted with baen, kankra, and&#13;
gewa.&#13;

(iv) Model III: Homestead&#13;
11.         Settlers would build a house at the edge of the homestead plot&#13;
furthest from the embankment facing north or east. The rest of the homestead&#13;
area would be a kitchen garden growing seasonal vegetables and fruits (banana,&#13;
papaya, mango). Fuelwood trees and betelnut could also be grown around the&#13;
plot. It is not envisaged that the project would provide any formal&#13;
assistance in the cultivation of homestead plots, but NGOs may provide advice&#13;
and other support on an ad hoc basis.&#13;
D. Estimation of PlantinQ Stock Reauirements&#13;
12.         Seedling requirements per km of embankment and foreshore are&#13;
estimated as follows:&#13;
(i) Embankment&#13;
Inner slope:&#13;
Top and bottom rows of palms (coconut, betelnut, and date palm)&#13;
- row to row distance: 10 m&#13;
- plant to plant distance: 10m coconut, 5m date; 2.5m betelnut&#13;
- number of seedlings required per km: coconut 100, date palm 200,&#13;
betelnut 400)&#13;
Middle row of fruit trees: guava, lemon (kaguji and jambura), kul,&#13;
sharifa, and jack fruit.&#13;
- row positioned at 5m from each row of palms.&#13;
- fruit trees would be grown in the following proportions: 25% guava,&#13;
20% kul, 25% lemon/kaguji, 10% lemon/jambura, 10% sharifa, and&#13;
10% jack fruit)&#13;
- plant to plant distance: 10m for kul; Sm for guava and&#13;
lemon; 20 m for jack fruit and jambura&#13;

E. Nursery Practice and Cost of Establishment&#13;
13.         The project would aim to support the development of private sector&#13;
nurseries, both by procuring as many seedlings as possible from existing&#13;
sources of supply, and by funding the establishment of additional nurseries by&#13;
NGOs and individuals. A number of nurseries are already established in&#13;
project polders by the FD, NGOs and private individuals. Channels have also&#13;
been developed to bring seedlings in for other areas such as Bola island and&#13;
Barisal. Although it will not be possible to precisely define nursery&#13;
requirements until detailed site specific planting plans are drawn up and the&#13;
capacity of local nurseries assessed, for the purposes of overall project&#13;
planning it has been assumed that 30% of fruit and timber trees and palms will&#13;
be procured from outside sources together with 10% of hedging plants. It is&#13;
assumed that all mangrove seedlings will be produced by project nurseries.&#13;
Only the production of mangrove seedlings, which require specialist&#13;
techniques, would remain the exclusive preserve of the forestry department.&#13;
Project nurseries for other seedlings will be established by channelling funds&#13;
via NGOs who will either establish nurseries themselves or support the&#13;
establishment of nurseries by individuals or groups.&#13;
14.         One year old seedlings, especially in the case of fruit trees and&#13;
mainland timber species, have a higher rate of survival when transplanted.&#13;
The general nursery technique would be polypot raised seedlings in 25 cm x 15&#13;
cm x 0.08 mm size polypots, except coconut, betelnut, and mangroves, that&#13;
would be bare rooted, and ipil-ipil that would be raised in 15 cm x 10 cm x&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -                          ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
0.06 mm size polypots. Seedlings of dholkolmi and sada akand may be grown in&#13;
polypots or the hedge rows may be established by direct planting or cuttings.&#13;
15.         The area required for nurseries on each polder has been calculated&#13;
from forecast seedling requirements and the nursery area required by seedlings&#13;
of different species (allowing for half the nursery area to be taken by paths&#13;
and storage areas). Allowances have been made for bought in seedlings, and a&#13;
failure rate (requiring replanting) of 40% for embankment planting and 100t&#13;
for foreshore planting. Planting is assumed to be spread over one to four&#13;
years for embankment species (depending on the embankment construction&#13;
schedule) and five years (including one year of replacement planting) for&#13;
foreshore seedlings. On this basis the numbers of nurseries required in each&#13;
polder.has been calculated in Table 5. The maximum size of a nursery is&#13;
assumed to be lha, and if the required area exceeds this, additional nurseries&#13;
will be required. A total of 29 non-mangrove nurseries (average size 0.65ha)&#13;
and 17 mangrove nurseries (average 0.15ha) would be established. In practice&#13;
NGO supported nurseries may be considerably smaller, but to split a nursery&#13;
into a number of sub-nurseries would have minimal impact on project cost&#13;
projections. Although it has been assumed that it will not be possible to&#13;
ship seedlings between nurseries on different polders, transport within a&#13;
polder should not be too much of a problem along the newly constructed&#13;
embankments.&#13;
16.         Each nursery would have a supervisors and an average of 14 workers&#13;
and guards for non-mangrove species, and 7 workers/guards for mangrove&#13;
nurseries. Each nursery would have sheds for workers' accommodation and&#13;
storage, together with fencing and tools. Non-mangrove nurseries would need a&#13;
supply of water (surface tank or tubewells), while mangrove nurseries need a&#13;
small embankment and simple sluice to control the level of tidal water.   The&#13;
cost of nurseries is estimated as follows:&#13;

Cost calculations for seedling production (excluding nursery establishment,&#13;
overheads and labor) and embankment and foreshore planting are shown in&#13;
Table 6. Costs excluding nursery establishment, overheads and labor amount to&#13;
Tk 16,832 per ha for embankment afforestation, Tk 30,205 per ha for raised&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 8 of 11&#13;
foreshores, and Tk 10,689 per ha for mangroves. Nursery establishment,&#13;
overheads and labor would add about Tk 9,400 per ha to these costs.&#13;
17.         Project cost allowances also include a van rickshaw (Tk 5,000&#13;
each) and bicycle (Tk 3,500 each) for each nursery. In addition FD&#13;
supervision and management costs to be funded by the project include&#13;
allowances for four ACFs responsible for each of the zones (Tk 12,000 each per&#13;
year) and 21 foresters posted to the polders (Tk 5,000 each per year),&#13;
together with four 4-wheel drive vehicles (Tk 1,000,000 each), 21 motorcycles&#13;
(Tk 100,000 each) and two speed boats (Tk 600,000 each), and vehicle running&#13;
costs and country boat rental (Tk 17,500,000 over 7 years). The above costs&#13;
exclude the costs of NGOs organizing and supervising community participation&#13;
in carrying out the afforestation program.&#13;
F. Production. Incomes and Marketing&#13;
18.         Estimated annual production from the proposed afforestation&#13;
component is summarized in Table 7. The major types of output that would come&#13;
from afforestation are fruits, vegetables, timber, and fuelwood. About&#13;
227,600 tons of fruits and vegetables and 224 million cubic feet of timber and&#13;
fuelwood are expected to be produced over the project life of 30 years. While&#13;
93% of the production of fruits and vegetables is expected to come from the&#13;
embankment slope and the rest from the homesteads, 96% of the timber&#13;
production is expected to come from the foreshore.&#13;
19.         Farm budgets for a one-hectare model farm on the embankment&#13;
slopes, a 15-hectare model farm on the foreshore, and a 200 m2 homestead farm&#13;
on the country side toe of the embankment are summarized in Tables 8, 9, and&#13;
10, respectively. The beneficiaries would begin to realize net positive&#13;
incomes from the afforestation, if all inputs including family labor were&#13;
valued at market prices,3 from the first, fourth, and ninth year of&#13;
afforestation on the homestead land, embankment slope, and foreshore,&#13;
respectively. In light of the fact that the Government would provide the&#13;
seedlings and the first three years requirements of fertilizer and pesticides,&#13;
and that embankment settlers would be using unpaid family labor, these&#13;
settlers would be receiving net positive cash incomes from the embankment&#13;
slope and homestead land from year one and the foreshore from year nine (see&#13;
Tables 5, 6, and 7). About 30% of the trees in the foreshore would be ready&#13;
for felling in the ninth year from planting. In the case of the homestead&#13;
plantation, all fruit trees would be producing and 30% of fuelwood trees would&#13;
be ready for felling in the sixth year.&#13;
3.    The seedling costs in the financial models are at market prices, which&#13;
contain an element of subsidy in that Government prices for seedlings do&#13;
not cover nursery establishment costs. These additional costs of about&#13;
Tk 7,800 per ha for nursery establishment and personnel plus the costs of&#13;
FD vehicles and vehicle operating expenditures and NGO services costs have&#13;
been added back in for the purposes of economic analysis and project cost&#13;
estimates.&#13;

20.         Fruits and timber would be the two major products expected from&#13;
the afforestation on embankment slopes and foreshore. There would be adequate&#13;
demand for these products. Fruits are in short supply in the coastal belt as&#13;
well as in the rest of the country for most of the year. Hence the farmers&#13;
are not expected to face difficulties in marketing the increased production of&#13;
fruits. Fuelwood and timber are also in short supply. The timber is used in&#13;
constructing houses and building fishing boats. There is a large fishing&#13;
community in the project area. The coastal areas are well connected by rivers&#13;
and, to some extent, by roads. Surplus output of fruits, timber or fuelwood&#13;
in a given area would thus be transported to deficit areas without much&#13;
difficulty.&#13;

1.          The project provides for improved operation and maintenance for&#13;
twenty one polders located mainly in the south eastern part of the country.&#13;
Improved O&amp;M would cover: operational activities which need to be carried out&#13;
to ensure the safety of embankments, to check that drainage canals (khals) are&#13;
effective, and for the safety and proper operation of drainage structures; and&#13;
maintenance activities on: (a) about 505 Km of sea facing embankments, and&#13;
about 260 Km of interior and marginal embankments on the non-coastal side&#13;
(Table 1); (b) all drainage regulators and surface sluices; (c) the drainage&#13;
network within the protected area and the outfall canals; and (d) the&#13;
afforested sections of the embankment slopes. These polders provide&#13;
protection to agricultural land with the exception of Polder 62, Patenga which&#13;
protects major public and private properties including the airport, naval&#13;
academy and export processing zone. The implementing agencies, BWDB and&#13;
Forest Department assisted by consultants, NGOs and the elected members of the&#13;
Union Parishad, would carry out O&amp;M utilizing the community particularly&#13;
landless persons, squatters on embankment, and destitute women.&#13;
Present Condition&#13;
Organization and Management.&#13;
2.          The BWDB Headquarter's Technical Unit under the overall control of&#13;
the Member O&amp;M assisted by the Chief Engineer O&amp;M is responsible for&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement of operational projects and the O&amp;M of these&#13;
projects. The unit comprises an O&amp;M Directorate and a Rehabilitation&#13;
Directorate headed by Project Directors (level of Superintendent Engineers).&#13;
The unit is required to: (a) review and consolidate the annual budget requests&#13;
prepared by field divisions covering operation, maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
and establish priorities under budget constraints; (b) develop long term (five&#13;
years) rolling budget requirements for O&amp;M covering operational projects and&#13;
projects expected to be completed during the plan period; (c) guide the field&#13;
divisions in preparing and updating O&amp;M manuals; (d) participate in&#13;
maintenance reviews, monitor progress and evaluate performance; (e) assist O&amp;M&#13;
field staff in solving new and difficult problems pertaining to O&amp;M and&#13;
rehabilitation; and (f) assist the BWDB Training Directorate in preparing and&#13;
executing O&amp;M training programs.&#13;
3.          At the field level, there are on average, three subdivisions&#13;
within a division and each is supervised by a Sub-divisional Engineer (SDE),&#13;
supported by three Section Officers (SOs)and a variable number of Works&#13;
Assistants (WAs). Embankment and Sluice Operators (Khalashis) are located at&#13;
each polder to carry out the operational activities and to assist in ensuring&#13;
the security of infrastructure. Job responsibilities of all field staff are&#13;
specified in the basic O&amp;M manual prepared in 1967.for the Coastal Embankment&#13;
Project.&#13;

Annual Budciets&#13;
4.          Budgetary requirements for O&amp;M, which includes: operations,&#13;
routine and periodic maintenance, maintenance during the implementation period&#13;
of on-going projects, and flood and cyclone damage repairs are provided for&#13;
under four categories: the revenue budget, development budget, food for work&#13;
program (FFW) and the foreign exchange budget. The main sources of funding&#13;
for operations, routine and periodic maintenance are from the revenue budget&#13;
and the FFW program. The annual divisional O&amp;M budget is based on the&#13;
following categories: (a) building repairs and construction; (b) protective&#13;
works; (c) resectioning works; (d) construction and repair of sluices;&#13;
(e) establishment; (f) transport and equipment; and (g) supply of fall boards&#13;
and gates. There is no facility for further breakdown of categories into&#13;
routine and periodic maintenance or secondary categories to enable monitoring&#13;
of physical and financial progress and establishment of realistic costs for&#13;
routine and periodic maintenance. BWDB uses up to 90% of its FFW allocations&#13;
for maintenance activities comprising: resectioning of embankments; breach&#13;
filling; and re-excavation of drainage channels. A major part (estimated at&#13;
about 67*) of the revenue budget was utilized to meet the high establishment&#13;
costs. It has been established by previous studies and as discussed in the&#13;
SAR for Systems Rehabilitation Project, Cr. 2099-BD (SRP) that the allocation&#13;
from the revenue budget for actual O&amp;M costs was about 40% short of the actual&#13;
requirement with the main shortfall recorded in the maintenance category where&#13;
in FY89 there was an estimated shortfall of about 75%. Under SRP, the&#13;
Government agreed to increase allocations for O&amp;M by at least 10* a year in&#13;
real terms. This agreement has been adhered to. The budget for maintenance&#13;
items (electricity, fuel and maintenance works) in FY94 was about US$12.6&#13;
million equivalent, close to double the US$6.5 million allocation in FY89.&#13;
Problems and Actions Directed to Imvrove OhM&#13;
5.          Problems could be categorized under two headings:  (1) Budgetary:&#13;
As earlier stated, activities which broadly fit into O&amp;M are financed from&#13;
four sources. The four budgets are prepared separately and at present there&#13;
is no system to extract and develop an overall O&amp;M work program. An overall&#13;
budget with realistic and identifiable items of work: (a) would prove and&#13;
justify annual requirements based on need; (b) adjust work programs in a&#13;
logical manner to match the allocation of scarce funds; and (c) assist in the&#13;
introduction of an effective monitoring system, identify issues and introduce&#13;
changes in a timely manner; and (2) Maintenance Activities: The present&#13;
absence of clear definitions of O&amp;M (particularly maintenance) and its&#13;
objectives provides a severe restraint on the current annual and long term&#13;
planning of O&amp;M activities. Planning of annual maintenance and the drawing up&#13;
of a rolling long term plan require:&#13;
(a)   the work activities such as routine and periodic maintenance, and&#13;
repairs to damages caused by floods and cyclone storms;&#13;
(b)   updating of the inventory of all BWDB facilities;&#13;
(c)   estimating rehabilitation and improvement requirements to bring&#13;
projects into a condition that routine and periodic maintenance&#13;
could commence and ensure the project's sustainability;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(d)   work standards and outputs;&#13;
(e)   community participation in routine and periodic maintenance;&#13;
(f)   an assessment of resources (manpower, materials and equipment);&#13;
and&#13;
(g)   annual work programs and schedules.&#13;
6.          Operational activities in polders in the coastal belt and flood&#13;
control projects in the mainland of the country are well defined and could be&#13;
carried out satisfactorily if all the infrastructure of the polders are&#13;
completed to the required design and are in an operational condition. In&#13;
irrigation projects several issues which are constraints to effective&#13;
operations have been identified and these are being addressed adequately under&#13;
the IDA financed Second Small Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation&#13;
Project, Cr.1870-BD (SSFCDI) and the SRP. Maintenance activities are effected&#13;
adversely due to several issues which need to be addressed before an effective&#13;
and sustainable system could be introduced. The issues include: (a) squatters&#13;
on the embankments and cuts in the embankment slopes to accommodate their&#13;
homesteads; (b) cultivation of perennial cash crops on embankment slopes;&#13;
(c) unauthorized planting of trees on the embankment slopes; (d) deep runnels&#13;
on embankment slopes; (e) earth slips at structures; (f) breaches caused by&#13;
floods and cyclonic storms, being left in a state of disrepair to face the&#13;
monsoons; (g) repairs of collapsed protection works not being done in a timely&#13;
manner; (h) settlement of the embankments due to poor compaction and slopes&#13;
not done to the designed profile; (i) flap gates at structures in a state of&#13;
disrepair or in most cases missing; (j) protection works, structural aprons&#13;
and wing walls of structures, damaged due to erosion; (k) silting up of&#13;
drainage network particularly in outfall canals affected by tidal conditions.&#13;
7.          In order to establish a rationale and sustainable plan for O&amp;M and&#13;
particularly for maintenance, the issues listed above are being addressed&#13;
under several donor assisted on-going projects such as the IDA financed SRP&#13;
(Cr.2099-BD) and the SSFCDI Project (Cr.1870-BD); the Dutch financed Land&#13;
Reclamation Project (LRP), Delta Development Project (DDP), and the Early&#13;
Implementation Project (EIP); the ADB financed Ganges-Kobadak Rehabilitation&#13;
Project (GKRP); and the IDA and CIDA financed Operation and Maintenance Cost&#13;
Cell (O&amp;MCC) under the SSFCDI Project. The Headquarters O&amp;M Technical unit&#13;
with the separation of rehabilitation and O&amp;M functions and training directed&#13;
to O&amp;M activities has already been established. The unit is presently&#13;
addressing aspects of routine and periodic maintenance including costs and the&#13;
O&amp;MCC is as a first step establishing standards and creating a computer based&#13;
program for a country wide schedule of rates for construction works. The CKRP&#13;
Project would establish a system to provide for floods and cyclone repairs in&#13;
the O&amp;M program. Under the SRP, models are being experimented on for&#13;
determining the effectiveness of carrying out periodic and routine maintenance&#13;
by groups of landless persons and destitute women. The CERP Project would&#13;
address the issue of squatters and cultivation of embankment slopes and direct&#13;
its effort to involve the community in carrying out all routine maintenance&#13;
and a major part of periodic maintenance.&#13;

ODeration and Maintenance Activities&#13;
8.          Operation.  Activities to be executed continuously include:&#13;
(a) patrolling of the embankment to detect weak sections, slips, signs of&#13;
squatter settlements, cultivation of perennial cash crops, cuts in the&#13;
embankment to accommodate homesteads, embankment subsidence and erosion and/or&#13;
settlement of protection works; (b) regular checks of structures to detect&#13;
slips at abutments, erosion of aprons, protection works and wing walls, and&#13;
periodic damage to flap gates and fall boards; (c) regulation of gates if&#13;
applicable (d) supervision of routine maintenance work. In addition at the&#13;
beginning of the monsoon, a condition survey (if needed an engineering survey)&#13;
of the embankment would be needed for estimating the periodic, cyclonic and&#13;
flood damage repairs to be carried out during the dry season. During the&#13;
monsoon operational activities would be stepped up to ensure timely action to&#13;
prevent damage. At the end of the monsoon, operational activities would&#13;
include: the condition survey of the embankment, and structures and an&#13;
engineering survey of the drainage network. These surveys would be required&#13;
to prepare details for carrying out periodic maintenance.&#13;
9.          Routine or Preventive Maintenance.  Activities to be executed&#13;
continuously include: (a) filling of runnels in embankment slopes and road;&#13;
(b) filling of minor slips in embankment slopes and abutments and wing walls&#13;
of structures; (c) repairing of rat holes; (d) preventive measures to stop&#13;
leaks and piping through the embankment; (e) maintaining recently planted&#13;
approved type of trees and replacement of trees, turf or grass bush;&#13;
(f) arresting settlement/erosion in aprons and protection works at structures;&#13;
(g) arresting collapse of protection works provided for prevention of river&#13;
bank erosion and wave action on embankment slopes; (h) clearing of debris and&#13;
water hyacinth in structure intake and outfall canals; (i) greasing of lifting&#13;
mechanism of regulators and surface sluices; (j) preventing cattle damage by&#13;
erecting and maintaining fences; (k) maintaining reservations along&#13;
embankments; (1) preventing new settlements on the embankment and reservations&#13;
or making of cuts in embankment slopes to accommodate homesteads; and&#13;
(m) clearing of debris and man-made obstacles, such as fish fences, in the&#13;
drainage canals.&#13;
10.         Periodic Maintenance.  Activities to be executed during the dry&#13;
season include: (a) maintaining the design profile of the embankment and&#13;
drainage canals; (b) repair of breaches and major slips caused by normal&#13;
annual monsoon and cyclonic storms; (c) repair of protection works provided&#13;
for arresting river bank erosion and damage due to wave action and providing&#13;
preventive works to minimize such damage; (d) permanent repairs to arrest&#13;
piping through the embankment; (e) permanent repairs to arrest damage to&#13;
aprons, wing walls and revetments at structures; (f) repairs or replacement of&#13;
flap gates and lifting mechanism of vertical lifting gates and replacement of&#13;
gate and sill rubber seals; (g) repairs or replacement of trashracks of&#13;
structures; (h) repairs to eroded concrete at structures; and (i) desilting of&#13;
drainage canals (frequency to be decided after a study of silting condition).&#13;
Earthworks would include compaction. Frequency of these activities would&#13;
depend on hydrological, and tidal conditions of the polder, and the soils used&#13;
in earthfill of embankments. Generally with effective routine maintenance the&#13;
frequency would be once every two years.&#13;
&#13;

11.         Repairs to damages caused by floods and cyclonic storms.  These&#13;
repairs are assessed after each storm and are financed under the development&#13;
budget which is funded by GOB and donor assisted emergency programs. (The&#13;
IDA, EU, Japan and Saudi funded PWP, and the several IDA and ADB assisted&#13;
Flood Rehabilitation Projects are a few examples of such works). Repairs&#13;
include: (a) filling of major breaches including retirements; (b) major&#13;
repairs to protection works or provision of new works; (c) major resectioning&#13;
of embankments; (d) repair or replacement of structures; and (e) replacement&#13;
of trees on embankment slopes.&#13;
12.         Afforestation.  With the exception of the recent introduction of&#13;
afforestation of embankment slopes on a very limited scale, afforestation has&#13;
not been introduced as a protection measure. Foreshore afforestation&#13;
development has not been systematically introduced to be effective as a&#13;
protection measure to embankments. It has now been established that embankment&#13;
and foreshore afforestation are the most economical and effective type of&#13;
protection work to ensure the security of the embankment during cyclonic&#13;
storms. Maintenance activities include: (a) upkeep of paths to facilitate&#13;
inspection of trees; (b) clearing around trees; (c) application of&#13;
fertilizers; (d) harvesting of produce from fruit trees; (e) controlled&#13;
harvesting of fuel woods and leaves; and (f) replanting according to set&#13;
guidelines and replacement of diseased or dead trees.&#13;
Proposals for Improving Operation and Maintenance&#13;
13.         The sustainability of a rehabilitated and improved polder would&#13;
depend primarily on effective routine and periodic maintenance. It could only&#13;
be ensured if the community which is safeguarded by the infrastructure&#13;
participates fully in these maintenance activities. The chairman and members&#13;
of the Union Parishad together with NGOs located in the area need to act as&#13;
facilitators to organize those participating in maintenance, particularly&#13;
routine maintenance, and help BWDB supervise the adequacy of their work. The&#13;
Project, while ensuring that technical standards are not sacrificed, provides&#13;
for a package of incentives to achieve the objective of maximum community&#13;
participation.&#13;
14          BWDB and the Forest Department would be the implementing agencies&#13;
for the embankment O&amp;M and afforestation and the foreshore afforestation&#13;
components respectively. All operational activities would be carried out by&#13;
the staff of BWDB. Routine maintenance of the rehabilitated embankments&#13;
including the plantations on embankment slopes would be handled by individual&#13;
families who would be granted contractual rights to the produce of trees in&#13;
return for their maintenance activities. Until such time as sufficient income&#13;
is obtained from the produce of the trees, these families would be paid an&#13;
allowance sufficient to sustain them (para 16 below and Annex 4). The&#13;
planting of foreshore afforestation would be carried out by community groups&#13;
and would be financed under the project. Maintenance, harvesting, and&#13;
replacement planting of harvested trees on public foreshore land would be&#13;
carried out by community groups, who would receive 75% of the produce.&#13;
Maintenance, harvesting, and replacement planting of foreshore afforestation&#13;
on private land would be carried out by the landowners on terms and conditions&#13;
described in Annex 4. Routine and periodic maintenance of embankments not&#13;
rehabilitated under the project, including the sections with existing heavy&#13;
plantations, and the periodic maintenance of embankment sections rehabilitated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107 -                          ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
under the project would be carried out either by community groups or, in the&#13;
absence of such viable groups, by contracts awarded following LCB procedures.&#13;
Funds for carrying out repairs to damages caused by floods and cyclonic storms&#13;
during the implementation period are provided for by the project. The&#13;
provision is adequate to cover storms which occur on average once every 5&#13;
years. Damage repairs would be contracted out to local contractors under&#13;
awards made following LCB procedures.&#13;
15.         The consultant responsible for implementation support would&#13;
provide advice and guidance to the implementing agencies in all technical and&#13;
social aspects of the improved O&amp;M program. In particular, the consultant&#13;
would establish standards for all O&amp;M activities, carry out work studies on&#13;
routine and periodic maintenance and khal re-excavation, update project rates&#13;
and work tasks, and monitor progress and evaluate the impact of the program.&#13;
During the project perod the consultant would at regular intervals update work&#13;
tasks, rates and costs. The project cost estimates include funds for seven&#13;
categories of improved O&amp;M expenditures. These include: (i) operational&#13;
activities; (ii) routine maintenance of rehabilitated embankments inclusive of&#13;
maintenance of trees on embankment for a specified period which would be from&#13;
the end of contractual commitment of the rehabilitation work until the produce&#13;
of trees on the embankment would provide adequate income; (iii) routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance of the embankments not rehabilitated and periodic&#13;
maintenance of the embankments rehabilitated under the project; (iv) routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance of the drainage network; (v) routine and periodic&#13;
maintenance of protection works; (vi) routine and periodic maintenance of&#13;
structures; and (vii) damage repairs to earthworks, protection works and&#13;
structures, caused by floods and cyclonic storms. IDA financing of&#13;
operation/maintenance and flood and cyclone damage repairs would be at a&#13;
declining scale (85% of O&amp;M expenditures through FY99, 65% in FYOO and FY01&#13;
and 45% in FY02. Organizational and financing aspects for the O&amp;M activities&#13;
are given below.&#13;
16.         Operation.  BWDB's existing field divisions and sub-divisions are&#13;
adequately staffed to carry out effectively all operational activities.&#13;
However, the field staff lack a proper understanding of these activities and&#13;
their importance for proper maintenance. Training provided under the project&#13;
would improve the situation. The project would include the required costs for&#13;
activities to ensure effective operation of the polders and the work would be&#13;
executed by the existing field staff of BWDB. Operational costs are estimated&#13;
on the basis of utilizing one patrol laborer (khalashi) for 6 Km of embankment&#13;
and one gate khalashi for three structures. Provision is also made for&#13;
engineering surveys to be carried out annually and an overhead cost of 10% for&#13;
services rendered by the SO and the SDE. No separate provision is made for&#13;
patrolling drainage canals as the gate khalashi can perform this task. It is&#13;
estimated that about Tk 5,000 would be required for 1 Km;&#13;
17.         Routine or Preventive Maintenance.  The responsibility for&#13;
maintenance would be on the community. BWDB would provide the technical&#13;
advice and NGOs would be responsible for supervision. BWDB, to ensure that&#13;
standards are met, would regularly check the work and advise NGOs on measures&#13;
needed to correct any substandard work (see para 22 below). Squatters and&#13;
those made landless by land acquisition under the project (and other landless&#13;
families to the extent of available area) would be settled at the toe of the&#13;
embankment on the country side and would be given contracts allowing them to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -                            ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
reside on this allotment and obtain the produce of the trees on a given&#13;
section of the embankment. It is estimated that an embankment section of 250&#13;
meters (four families per Km) would produce adequate benefits to maintain a&#13;
family (Annex 4). In return, the family would provide routine maintenance of&#13;
their section of the embankment and the maintenance of trees in this reach.&#13;
They would be paid for their embankment maintenance activities by BWDB until&#13;
the trees had grown sufficiently to provide an adequate income. If hired&#13;
labor is employed, the cost of routine maintenance to ensure that the designed&#13;
profile and crest level are maintained throughout the year, and in addition&#13;
reduce periodic maintenance costs, is estimated at Tk 18,000 per Km or about&#13;
Tk 4,500 per ha of embankment for the life of the embankment. In addition to&#13;
plant and maintain trees on the embankment using hired labor would cost about&#13;
Tk 2,000 per ha on average for the first three years after embankment&#13;
completion. The arrangements under the proposed project would involve&#13;
somewhat higher costs during the initial years to sustain families until the&#13;
trees had reached sufficient maturity but would eliminate the need to pay for&#13;
routine embankment maintenance thereafter. To sustain families during the&#13;
period of maturity of trees, each family would receive Tk 9,000 in YR1,&#13;
Tk 8,000 in YR2, Tk 7,000 in YR3, Tk 6,500 in YR4. The produce of the trees&#13;
and the homestead plots should be sufficient to provide subsistence from YR5.&#13;
However, as a contingency to deal with possible delays, cost estimates provide&#13;
funds in YR5 to cover half the families receiving Tk 4,500 each. The NGOs&#13;
would monitor the actual earnings from embankment afforestation and homestead&#13;
cultivation. In case of major disruptions in a polder from the assumed&#13;
afforestation program, such as might occur due to significant storms or a&#13;
disease outbreak, the NGOs would recommend appropriate modifications to the&#13;
declining payment scale. Participating families would also be provided&#13;
seedlings and technical advice in planting approved species on the embankment&#13;
and would be reimbursed for their expenditure for fertilizer and pesticides&#13;
for the first three years. Provision would be made to remove families who do&#13;
not adequately perform their duties. Modified arrangements would apply in&#13;
Sandwip (Polder 72) and Ramgati (Polder 59/2) due to the high intensity of&#13;
squatter settlement. Groups would be organized to take responsibility for&#13;
embankment afforestation and maintenance, with each family responsible for the&#13;
maintenance and receiving the benefit of the produce of the trees for a much&#13;
smaller section of the embankment than in the standard model (perhaps 1/4 to&#13;
1/8 ha). This would not be expected to provide subsistence income but&#13;
(together with the produce from the homestead plot) would supplement whatever&#13;
sources of income had been maintaining the families up until now.&#13;
18.         Periodic Maintenance.  BWDB, assisted by consultants, would&#13;
estimate at the end of the monsoon season the requirements for the periodic&#13;
maintenance of the embankment, drainage regulators and sluices, protection&#13;
works, and the drainage network. Work plans and procurement methods would be&#13;
agreed upon and implementation would commence at the start of the dry season&#13;
and completed before the onset of the monsoons. Efforts would be made to&#13;
allocate earthwork's contracts to landless groups and destitute women groups.&#13;
In areas where such groups could not be organized, the work would be on&#13;
contracts awarded following LCB procedures. The role of NGOs is described in&#13;
para 22. Earthwork costs have been estimated based on about 800 cubic meters&#13;
of earthwork performed by labor intensive groups (Tk 30,000 per Km for&#13;
embankments, Tk 17,000 per Km for khals), protection works repairs based on&#13;
about 60 cubic meter per Km (Tk 60,000 per Km) and structure repairs at a lump&#13;
sum of Tk 10,000 per structure.  It is estimated that about 90 groups each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109-                            ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 8 of 10&#13;
with 25 persons would be required to carry out periodic maintenance (29 groups&#13;
for areas where no rehabilitation and improvement works have been carried out&#13;
and about 60 for areas where rehabilitation and improvement has taken place).&#13;
19.         Flood or Cyclone Damacce Repairs.  Provision is made in the project&#13;
for flood and cyclone damage repairs on an annual basis. Costs estimated for&#13;
a disaster occurrence once every 5 years are calculated on a damage section of&#13;
about 3 Km (a realistic assumption as the effects of such storms would be&#13;
limited to about a reach of 3 Km). For storms occurring once every 20 and 40&#13;
years, special arrangements would be needed to fund damage repairs. It is&#13;
expected that if such storms occur after full maturity of the afforested area,&#13;
damages would be drastically reduced and GOB with its own resources would be&#13;
able to finance the works. Sections that would be affected by such cyclones&#13;
are estimated on the basis historical records and not on the full length of&#13;
the sea-facing embankments. The annual lump sums provided in the cost&#13;
estimates for damage repairs to the sections are estimated on the basis of&#13;
rates varying from a maximum of Tk 1,000,000/Km for earthwork, Tk 560,000/Km&#13;
for protection works and Tk 25,000/No for structures respectively in the first&#13;
year after completion of rehabilitation work to a minimum of Tk 60,000/Km,&#13;
Tk 460,000/Km and Tk 10,000/No in the fourth year after completion. The&#13;
reduced cost is due to the protection afforded by afforestation.&#13;
Community Participation&#13;
20.         The concept of community participation in O&amp;M is predicated on&#13;
past experience which has shown that the maintenance of embankment,&#13;
particularly routine activities has been minimal if not non-existent. BWDB's&#13;
record in embankment maintenance is bleak and suggests that this has never&#13;
been a priority for the Board. Consequently, it is hypothesized that local&#13;
communities who stand to gain most from well maintained embankments, can be&#13;
co-opted to undertake routine maintenance on sections of the embankment&#13;
abutting or lying in close proximity to their lands. The most affected in the&#13;
local community are the squatter population living on the embankment, the&#13;
landless (people who have lost their land through erosion during cyclonic&#13;
storms and river bank erosion and people whose lands are being acquired), and&#13;
destitute women. These people would benefit most from a scheme which would&#13;
ensure a subsistence living initially and in due course an adequate income to&#13;
maintain themselves and their families. The scheme would also open the&#13;
possibility of income generating opportunities. The project also includes an&#13;
afforestation program which would be an integral part of the embankment, being&#13;
the primary source of protection against damage by cyclonic storms. It would&#13;
be difficult for the Forest Department to manage and maintain a tree planting&#13;
program on a departmental basis. This points to the desirability of community&#13;
participation in the afforestation component.&#13;
21.         Role of Locally Elected Officials and NGOs.  It is proposed to&#13;
establish locally constituted committees at each Union in the project area to&#13;
coordinate project activities in the Union. Such committees would be headed&#13;
by the Union Parishad Chairman, and would include the BWDB Subdivisional&#13;
Engineer, a Forest Department Range Officer, and representatives of the&#13;
participating NGO and DAE. This committee, particularly the Chairman of the&#13;
Union Parishad and the NGO, would be responsible, inter alia, for motivation&#13;
and organizing the individuals and their families to undertake routine&#13;
maintenance. The committee would also assist in controlling future squatter&#13;
&#13;

settlements on the embankment. See Annex 3 for details on the role of locally&#13;
elected officials and NGOs.&#13;
22.         The main responsibility of the NGOs for embankment maintenance&#13;
would be to organize the resettled families to carry out effectively the&#13;
routine maintenance of the embankments rehabilitated under the project.&#13;
Responsibilities would include: (a) assistance to the implementation agencies&#13;
and consultants in the resettlement of families; (b) finalizing agreements&#13;
between BWDB and the families; (c) direction and supervision of routine&#13;
maintenance activities; (d) certification of interim payments (probably&#13;
monthly), joint inspections with BWDB to check on the quality of work; and&#13;
(e) assist in disbursing monies to families. To perform their duties&#13;
effectively, particularly in the technical aspects, NGOs would receive&#13;
training in routine maintenance activities. (NGO responsibilities for&#13;
afforestation are detailed an Annex 3). For periodic maintenance, since&#13;
supervision and payments require special skills which cannot be achieved&#13;
without going through a detailed engineering course (e.g topographical&#13;
surveys, setting out etc.), NGOs would assist in the formation of groups&#13;
including the appointment of the group leader and in administration and&#13;
financial aspects of contract management such as maintaining accounting&#13;
documents and disbursement of monies to the group members. BWDB would be&#13;
responsible for awarding contracts, setting out and supervision, measurements&#13;
and payments to the group leader who would be the signatory in the contract&#13;
document.&#13;
23.         Role of the ImDlementation Support Consultant.  The scope of the&#13;
consultant services on social development activities which is directed mainly&#13;
on assistance to form effective community participation is described in detail&#13;
in Annex 6.&#13;
Imlementation Schedule&#13;
24.         Under project financing, operational activities and maintenance on&#13;
embankment sections completed under the PWP would commence in the first year&#13;
of the project (FY96), maintenance activities on the embankments rehabilitated&#13;
under the project would commence after the contractual commitments of the&#13;
civil work's contracts are fulfilled, generally in project year 3 or 4 (FY98&#13;
or FY99). Community participation in maintenance activities is described in&#13;
detail in Annex 3.&#13;
Estimated Cost&#13;
25.         The total cost over a period of seven years is estimated at&#13;
Tk 262.6 million (US$6.0 million) inclusive of price contingencies (no&#13;
allowance is made for physical contingencies) or about Tk 340,000 per Km for a&#13;
length of about 770 Km falling under the maintenance program of the project&#13;
for the project period of seven years. The annual cost of O&amp;M based on YR4 of&#13;
the post project period would be about Tk 46 million (US$1.1 million) or&#13;
Tk 59,000 per Km (US$1,500 per Km) excluding the cost of routine maintenance&#13;
which would be carried out by families. The O&amp;M requirements for the polders&#13;
during project implementation (yearwise) and after the project period are&#13;
given in Table 3 of this annex. (The above cost estimates exclude a total&#13;
during the project period of about $0.3 million equivalent for reimbursing&#13;
embankment settlers for fertilizer and pesticides for the first three years of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 111 -                          ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 10 of 10&#13;
afforestation. For ease of administration these costs would be met through&#13;
the O&amp;M budget. The fertilizer and pesticides would be financed under the&#13;
forestry component of the project.)&#13;
26.   Of the total project cost for O&amp;M, GOB would finance about&#13;
US$2.1 million and IDA about US$3.9 million. The cost of routine maintenance&#13;
of most of the rehabilitated embankments would continue to be financed by IDA&#13;
and GOB during the project period as it is estimated that families responsible&#13;
for this maintenance activity would continue to be dependent on the&#13;
subsistence allowance until the fifth year of planting (with a contingency&#13;
provision for some families still needing continued subsistence payments in&#13;
the fifth year). However, families on PWP financed embankments would be&#13;
expected to become independent of such subsistence payments during the project&#13;
period, while families to be settled on the embankments financed under the&#13;
minor works program would require continued subsistence payments for a few&#13;
years after the project period. During the first and second post project&#13;
year, the estimated annual cost of O&amp;M to be borne by GOB would be about Tk 53&#13;
million and Tk 49 million respectively in (FY95 prices) and when remaining&#13;
families take over the full responsibility (physical and financial) in the&#13;
third post-project year, the cost would reduce to Tk 46 million.&#13;
Acqreements to be obtained from GOB&#13;
27.         At negotiations, agreement would be reached that adequate annual&#13;
budgetary allocations would be provided for O&amp;M, both during the project and&#13;
thereafter, including the forecast cost of repairs of damage caused by floods&#13;
and cyclonic storms of severity occurring up to once in five years, based upon&#13;
the O&amp;M budgeting and monitoring procedures being developed by the O&amp;M costing&#13;
and budgeting cell (under the SRP project). Current indicative estimates of&#13;
budgetary requirements are given in Table 3 of this Annex. In addition, BWDB&#13;
would be expected by June 30, 1997 to update the present O&amp;M manual and&#13;
operational plan for the project polders to include details of community&#13;
participation in embankment routine maintenance and the concept of&#13;
afforestation as a protective measure.&#13;

1/    Routine maintenance include the area covered by the slopes and crest.&#13;
2/    The lengths specified under the column Interior/Marginal Embankments where no works are proposed are limited to&#13;
the sections to be maintained under the project. The remaining sections are in a stable condition or covered with&#13;
intensive plantations&#13;
3/    Number of families is estimated on the basis of an hectare for routine maintenance with the exception of Ramgati&#13;
and Sandwip.&#13;
4/    Groups of 25 persons would carry out the routine and periodic maintenance of the embankment reaches where no&#13;
rehabilitation and improvements works are proposed under PWP and CERP. Twenty nine groups are estimated to be&#13;
required for this purpose. Similar groups would carry out the periodic maintenance of the sections where routine&#13;
maintenance is carried out by individual families. For this work about 60 groups would be required annually.&#13;
Members of the families responsible for routine maintenance could also participate in the periodic maintenance.&#13;
5/    Periodic maintenance is estimated to be carried out on a portion of the embankment at a frequency of two years.&#13;
6/    At Ramgati 81 squatter families on the portion to be resectioned would be accommodated within this portion.  Each&#13;
family would be responsible to maintain about 0.2 of an ha. The income of the male members are reported to be&#13;
mainly from fishing. The female members would be mainly used for maintenance.&#13;
7/    At Sandwip, the project would provide for the resettlement of all squatters in the 3.7 km portion of the&#13;
resectioned embankment from ch 46.0 to 49.7, 106 families in the same reach of the embankment.  This is due to the&#13;
possible refusal of these squatters to resettle far away from the town. The squatters living in the remaining&#13;
portion of the resectioned embankment would be resettled in the completed PWP embankments. The resettlement for&#13;
the maintenance of the resectioned embankment between ch 49.7 to 53.4, and 57.77 to 58.33, the new embankment&#13;
under CERP and the PWP embankments would be on the basis of 4 per km, with each family maintaining an ha.  The&#13;
families resttled between ch 46.0 to 49.7 would maintain about 0.14 of an ha.&#13;
8/    Total number of families inclusive of members of family groups carrying out routine maintenance is 1,977.&#13;

COASTAL EMBANKMENT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance for Project Implementation and Evaluation&#13;
1.         This Annex provides draft Terms of Reference for consultant's&#13;
services to assist the implementing agencies in: (a) construction planning and&#13;
supervision of civil works in the rehabilitation and improvement component;&#13;
(b) the afforestation program; (c) the operation and maintenance of&#13;
infrastructure of the polders; (d) the maintenance of the foreshore&#13;
afforestation development; (e) organizing with the assistance of the NGOs for&#13;
communities to effectively carry out routine maintenance and afforestation of&#13;

Background&#13;
2.         The severe cyclone, which hit the south eastern part of the country&#13;
on April 29, 1991 caused extensive damages to the coastal embankment and left&#13;
large areas virtually unprotected against tidal flooding and cyclone surges.&#13;
The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) through a Priority Works Program (PWP)&#13;
commencing in FY93 is near to completion of a program of reconstruction and&#13;
improvement works of the sea facing embankments in ten polders included in the&#13;
Mid-Term Plan which were the worst affected by the cyclone. Work includes&#13;
about 190 km of embankment resectioning, 60 km of retired embankments (new),&#13;
allied protection works and repair or replacement of drainage structures.&#13;
Under the on-going technical assistance financed by the European Community&#13;
(EC) consultants provide the project support which includes: (a) the&#13;
preparation of engineering documentation; (b) assistance in the evaluation of&#13;
bids following ICB procedures; (c) contract management and supervision of all&#13;
contracts awarded following ICB procedures; (d) training of staff in&#13;
preparation of tender documents, supervision organization, quality control,&#13;
site administration, and contractual and legal aspects of contract management;&#13;
and (e) monitoring and evaluation of the social impacts, and planning social&#13;
development programs including a system for the future Operation and&#13;
Maintenance (O&amp;M) of the completed polders mainly directed towards the&#13;
participation of the community. In addition, consultants are responsible for&#13;
the preparation of engineering documentation inclusive of tender documents for&#13;
the eleven polders of the Coastal Embankment Rehabilitation Project (CERP)&#13;
with new major works. The social development team are also assisting in&#13;
developing programs for community participation in CERP.&#13;
3.         Project support for CERP, whilst continuing the emphasis on&#13;
supervision and contract management of major civil works contracts to be&#13;
awarded following ICB procedures, would include: (a) review, updating and, as&#13;
appropriate, revision of detailed engineering documentation of minor civil&#13;
works prepared by Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and the Systems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Rehabilitation Project (SRP); (b) assistance in field supervision and quality&#13;
control of minor civil works; and (c) assistance to the effective&#13;
implementation of the afforestation component and the improved O&amp;M component.&#13;
The program of civil works would cover: (i) major reconstruction for about 78&#13;
km of embankment resectioning, 73 km of new embankments, protection works and&#13;
allied drainage structures of the twelve polders (including work remaining in&#13;
one PWP polder); and (ii) in seventeen polders, minor works comprising about&#13;
130 km of embankment resectioning, 4 km of new interior embankments,&#13;
repairs/replacement of about 145 allied drainage structures, and about 390 km&#13;
re-excavation of drainage canals (khals). The programs of afforestation and&#13;
improved O&amp;M would be undertaken in twenty-one polders.&#13;
Scope of Consultant Services&#13;
4.        The consultant's services would cover the following:&#13;
(a) contract management and supervision of all major civil works under&#13;
the direction of the BWDB inclusive of monitoring of progress and&#13;
quality control;&#13;
(b) assistance to BWDB in the tendering and award of two ICB contracts&#13;
(one major works and one minor works) for completion of PWP works&#13;
and one ICB major works contract of additional works (tentatively&#13;
estimated to require 6 km of retirement) to cope with recent&#13;
erosion.&#13;
(c) checking of preconstruction documentation of all minor civil works&#13;
prepared by BWDB and the SRP consultants and in association with&#13;
BWDB, making changes as required;&#13;
(d) assistance to BWDB in the field supervision and monitoring of&#13;
quality control of minor civil works;&#13;
(e) assistance to the Forest Department and BWDB, in conjunction with&#13;
NGOs, in implementing the afforestation program in all technical&#13;
and financial aspects inclusive of monitoring of progress and&#13;
quality. In addition assistance would include pilot operations&#13;
testing use of vetiver grass on project embankments.&#13;
(f) assistance to BWDB in implementing the improved O&amp;M component;&#13;
(g) in association with NGOs, assistance in planning social development&#13;
programs, including a system for the involvement of the community&#13;
in the maintenance of completed works;&#13;
(h) undertaking monitoring of physical and financial progress and the&#13;
economic and social impact in twenty one polders of the Mid-Term&#13;
Program;&#13;
&#13;

(i) assistance in monitoring to identify any adverse environmental&#13;
effects and proposing appropriate mitigating measures;&#13;
(j) providing coordination between this project and programs under&#13;
other projects, including in particular, the on-going IDA assisted&#13;
Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP), to improve&#13;
agricultural productivity in the project area; and&#13;
(k) providing specialist inputs to the training program and for studies&#13;
to identify the possibility of cost-effective town protection works&#13;

Responsibilities of the Consultant&#13;
5.        Preconstruction Activities.  The consultants supervising&#13;
implementation of the PWP project would also be responsible for preparation of&#13;
the engineering documents for the major civil works in the eleven new CERP&#13;
polders and assisting BWDB in the tendering process. These activities are&#13;
expected to be completed before the appointment of the consultants financed&#13;
under this project. The project consultants will however be responsible for&#13;
preparing new ICB tender documents for about $3 million of work for completion&#13;
of PWP works. In addition, the consultants would review alternatives and&#13;
prepare a proposed design for cost-effective works to cope with recent erosion&#13;
in one of the polders and, after review and approval of the proposal, prepare&#13;
ICB tender documents. (About $2 million has been tentatively allocated for&#13;
these works.) BWDB field divisions provided the data needed for costing the&#13;
minor works.  In addition the SRP consultant carried out feasibility studies&#13;
for most of the polders under CERP and PWP, and completed engineering&#13;
documentation suitable for tendering. However, some of the feasibility&#13;
studies and engineering designs dealt inadequately with environmental and&#13;
social conditions and cost effectiveness and do not provide a practical guide&#13;
to finalize the engineering documentation for implementation of the minor&#13;
works program. The CERP consultant, in association with BWDB field divisions,&#13;
would review the proposals, revise the feasibility studies and finalize a cost&#13;
effective and practical implementation program. Particular attention would be&#13;
paid to minimizing resettlement. After approval of the program, the&#13;
consultant would prepare the bidding documents following LCB procedures for&#13;
embankment repairs, minor retirements, and repairs/replacement of structures.&#13;
Quantities for khal re-excavation and documents suitable for carrying out the&#13;
work under the FFW program would also be prepared. Additional surveys&#13;
required would be carried by BWDB.&#13;
6.        Contract ManaQement and Supervision.  All major civil works in a&#13;
polder would be awarded as one contract package following ICB procedures. The&#13;
package shall include earthworks, protection works and allied drainage&#13;
structures. In most cases, there would be one contract for each polder, but&#13;
in a few cases two polders would be included in one package. All minor works&#13;
with the exception of Khal re-excavation would be carried out on contracts&#13;
awarded following LCB procedures or by landless or destitute women groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

contracted on the basis of the engineer's estimatell. Re-excavation of khals&#13;
would be carried out on the FFW program. The consultant's field staff&#13;
(specifically recruited for the work) would assist BWDB field divisions in the&#13;
supervision of all minor works carried out by local contractors, the community&#13;
groups and the FFW program. Particularly, consultants would monitor the&#13;
quality of work and ensure that early remedial action is taken by BWDB to&#13;
rectify any substandard work.&#13;
7.        For works awarded on ICB procedures, the consultant would&#13;
responsible for the overall and on-site supervision of the contractors&#13;
undertaking construction, including supplementary designs, where needed.&#13;
Specifically the consultant would be required to:&#13;
(a) initially on receipt of the program of execution from contractors&#13;
under the terms of the works contract, prepare a program for the&#13;
mobilization of his resident site staff and submit this to BWDB for&#13;
approval, prior to the actual mobilization;&#13;
(b) set up suitable site supervision teams, with adequate staff who&#13;
shall reside at each polder, to supervise in association with BWDB&#13;
divisional and subdivisional staff and report on the works under&#13;
the contract in accordance with the works contract document. The&#13;
consultant shall ensure that field supervision are present&#13;
continuously at site throughout construction activities. Paras 17&#13;
and 18 specify guidelines to assist the consultant in setting up an&#13;
effective organization;&#13;
(c) ensure that the pre-work surveys are carried out by the contractor&#13;
during the mobilization period and plans submitted to the&#13;
consultant within two weeks of the commencement of such work. The&#13;
consultant should ensure that no work is done by the contractor&#13;
without approval of the pre-work survey plans and quantities.&#13;
(d) approve the contractor's superintendence and key personnel;&#13;
(e) approve the contractor's plant and equipment;&#13;
(f) order the removal and replacement of improper materials and work;&#13;
(g) check and approve the necessary measurements and calculations for&#13;
the contractor's interim running bills and certifying such bills;&#13;
(h) examine at site the measurement of any work which is about to be&#13;
covered up or put out of view before permanent work is placed&#13;
thereon and/or examine and attend the measuring of the completed&#13;
work;&#13;
1.        Landless  and destitute women groups  would be  limited  to minor&#13;
embankment repairs, and minor slips at structures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 5 of 26&#13;
(i) call and keep minutes of routine site meetings between the parties&#13;
of the contract;&#13;
(j) complete supplementary details of hydraulic structures required by&#13;
the contractors. Required topographical and soil surveys would be&#13;
carried out by the contractors under the direction of the&#13;
consultant;&#13;
(k) provide the required information for the contractor to set out the&#13;
works and check the accuracy of the setting out, specifically the&#13;
setting up of reference points inclusive of establishment of bench&#13;
marks with datum levels set to the required degree of accuracy;&#13;
(1) review the contractor's work proposal, working drawings etc. in&#13;
accordance with the requirements of the works contract document,&#13;
advise modifications as necessary and recommend these proposals for&#13;
approval;&#13;
(m)  review the contractor's work program, and where necessary request&#13;
revisions to account for the current status of the works;&#13;
(n) through the chief construction engineers, resident engineers,&#13;
technical officers and other on-site field staff, supervise the day&#13;
to day operations of the contractor to ensure compliance with the&#13;
contract;&#13;
(o) supervise tests on materials to be used in the works prior to&#13;
incorporation, approve type, quality and source of materials and in&#13;
addition tests to be carried by the contractor on completed works&#13;
required for ensuring that works meet the standards specified in&#13;
the works contract. All labor, materials and equipment required&#13;
for tests would be at contractor's expense.&#13;
B.        In addition the consultant would be required to:&#13;
(a) make recommendations to BWDB on the contractor's claims for&#13;
additional payment, extensions of time and other contractual&#13;
matters, the relevant site conditions and the contractor's detailed&#13;
submissions;&#13;
(b) in the event of variations to the works being required, prepare the&#13;
necessary documents, negotiate with the contractor and submit the&#13;
variation order to BWDB for approval;&#13;
(c)  maintain detailed diaries of relevant events and activities;&#13;
(d) set up and maintain a correspondence and document storage and&#13;
retrieval system to record all relevant communications between the&#13;
parties to the contract, all measurement and quality control&#13;
details and variations to the work as they occur;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 6 of 26&#13;
(e) maintain as built drawings and documents;&#13;
(f) prepare monthly progress reports for each contract in a form&#13;
acceptable to BWDB and IDA. These reports will include as a&#13;
minimum, details of the physical and financial status of each&#13;
contract, details of delays and the budgetary effect of these and&#13;
particular problems with suggested solutions;&#13;
(g) carry out final inspections of the works and recommend the issue of&#13;
the final certificates;&#13;
(h) check and certify the contractor's progress payments and after the&#13;
final inspection, the final accounts and certify them correct for&#13;
payment;&#13;
(i) check and certify reimbursement claims to be forwarded to IDA. In&#13;
a separate correspondence and document storage and retrieval&#13;
system, record all relevant correspondence related to reimbursement&#13;
claims;&#13;
(j) prepare completion reports in a form acceptable to BWDB and IDA;&#13;
(k) during the 12 month contractor maintenance period, the consultant&#13;
would periodically check the completed work. Shortly before the&#13;
end of the maintenance period, the consultant would carry out the&#13;
necessary inspections, specify the rectification work to be done,&#13;
supervise this as required, and recommend to BWDB the issuance of&#13;
the maintenance certificate.&#13;
(1) to ensure the early resettlement of families for the afforestation&#13;
of embankment slopes and for routine maintenance the consultants&#13;
shall take over the completed section of embankment (new and&#13;
resection) and the contractor's work program shall be proposed&#13;
accordingly to meet the targets set for afforestation and&#13;
resettlement.&#13;
9.        For minor civil works such as resectioning or new embankments,&#13;
repair or replacement of structures and minor revetments, the consultant would&#13;
design records to be maintained at the consultant's site office and monitor&#13;
the keeping of such records, including all data for preparing reimbursement&#13;
claims. Consultant's would specifically be required to:&#13;
(a) finalize the detailed designs, considering both issues of the&#13;
stability of embankments and resettlement of displaced families;&#13;
(b) establish sufficient reference points set by BWDB for control of&#13;
alignment and levels to the required degree of accuracy;&#13;
(c) enforce construction procedures, and check at critical stages of&#13;
construction such as: for hydraulic structures, excavation of&#13;
foundations, fabrication and erection of formwork, reinforcement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 7 of 26&#13;
placement, concrete pours, and fabrication and erection of gates&#13;
and lifting mechanism; and for earthfill, compaction in embankment&#13;
fill and backfill at structures. In addition assist BWDB in&#13;
supervision by posting sufficient numbers of site supervisors of&#13;
the level of Works Assistants;&#13;
(d) assist BWDB in processing contractor's claims for additional&#13;
payments, extensions of time and variation orders;&#13;
(e) maintain a detailed diary of relevant events for each polder. The&#13;
diary would contain records of field observations given by&#13;
consultants staff, discussions with staff of the zonal, circle and&#13;
field divisions and subdivisions of the implementation organization&#13;
BWDB, comments on quality and progress, actions taken by BWDB and&#13;
contractors, and any relevant information that would ensure the&#13;
required construction standards and progress;&#13;
(f) prepare monthly progress reports for each polder. These reports&#13;
would include as a minimum, details of physical and financial&#13;
progress, the preconstruction activities, status of reimbursement&#13;
claims;&#13;
(g) check and certify progress payment claims and the final payment and&#13;
certifying reimbursement claims; and&#13;
(h) check work during the maintenance period and recommendation to BWDB&#13;
on the issue of the maintenance certificate and refund of the&#13;
security deposit.&#13;
10.       During the pre-construction phase of the minor civil works program,&#13;
the consultants staff of the unit in headquarters, and the field offices of&#13;
the chief construction engineer, the regional resident engineers, and the site&#13;
would, in addition to their responsibilities for the major civil works, carry&#13;
out the required pre-construction activities. During the construction period&#13;
the consultants staff at the site level (particularly the grade of technical&#13;
officers) would be increased sufficiently to ensure effective supervision,&#13;
The consultant would also during the pre-construction phase prepare a proposal&#13;
for the mobilization of his site staff, detailing the grades of staff, their&#13;
qualifications and experience and their responsibilities. This program would&#13;
be submitted to BWDB for review and discussion at least 6 months prior to the&#13;
start of construction. The agreed proposal would be implemented with staff&#13;
posted to the sites at least one month prior to the commencement of&#13;
construction.&#13;
11.       Imvroved O&amp;M.  Past experience indicates that progressive&#13;
deterioration of embankments due to poor maintenance aggravated the collapse&#13;
of embankments during cyclonic and monsoon storms. Although BWDB has adequate&#13;
staff to carry out operational activities, they are not capable at present of&#13;
identifying and supervising maintenance activities which are critical to a&#13;
sustainable system. It is reported that in addition to budgetary constraints,&#13;
the lack of motivation and training in maintenance activities are the main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 8 of 26&#13;
reasons for the present unsatisfactory situation. The project's main focus&#13;
would be to introduce a system that would include routine or preventive&#13;
maintenance carried out throughout the year and periodic maintenance&#13;
(proposed once every two years) carried out during the dry season. In&#13;
addition, during the project period, funds are provided for repairs to damages&#13;
caused by floods and cyclonic storms of a scale expected to occur on average&#13;
up to once every five years. The Government's contribution to the repair of&#13;
such damage could be provided when a disaster occurs. It is expected that&#13;
with afforestation as the main protection measure, once the trees have grown&#13;
sufficiently, damage due to disasters would be minimized and for normal annual&#13;
cyclonic and monsoon storms, maintenance costs would be drastically reduced&#13;
and eliminated if routine maintenance is carried out effectively. Activities&#13;
for an effective program for improved O&amp;M are described in detail in Annex 5.&#13;
Consultant's role would be to assist the staff of the implementing agencies,&#13;
and, with major input from participating NGOs, to motivate and guide the&#13;
elected members of the Union Parishad and the benefitted community, in&#13;
carrying out maintenance activities. Consultant would be required to;&#13;
(a) prepare a simplified manual for the operational staff of BWDB.&#13;
This would include activities to be performed and responsibilities;&#13;
(b) review estimates of O&amp;M quantities and costs for each polder and&#13;
update as required. This may require a work study to determine&#13;
reaches that could be effectively carried out by a patrol laborer&#13;
for operational activities and by a laborer for routine&#13;
maintenance.  Consultant would also monitor short reaches of the&#13;
drainage canals to determine the quantity of silt and the frequency&#13;
of desilting operations;&#13;
(c) assist the implementing agencies in effectively running the routine&#13;
maintenance program, using settlers as described elsewhere in this&#13;
report. During implementation consultant would identify problems&#13;
in running the proposed program, specifically the performance of&#13;
families, their capacity to effectively maintain the allocated&#13;
sections, and requirements for additional training or supervision&#13;
and suggest changes as needed;&#13;
(d) assist BWDB and NGOs in supervision of periodic maintenance of&#13;
rehabilitated embankments, periodic and routine maintenance of&#13;
embankments not rehabilitated under the project and periodic and&#13;
routine maintenance of structures and the drainage network, which&#13;
would be carried out by community groups or on small scale&#13;
contracts awarded under LCB procedures. Consultant would identify&#13;
and cost separately routine and periodic maintenance activities and&#13;
the frequency of such operations. The proposed program for such&#13;
works should be completed before the end of FY98, and changes as&#13;
needed and updating would be carried out during the maintenance&#13;
period;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 9 of 26&#13;
(e) assist in the training of NGOs to supervise routine maintenance&#13;
activities and associate with NGOs in the certification process&#13;
proposed for payments to families by BWDB; and&#13;
(f) assist in damage assessment after flood and cyclonic storm&#13;
disasters, and prepare programs with detail engineering&#13;
documentation for implementation;&#13;
(g) prepare annual work programs for each polder and a composite&#13;
program for all polders in the Mid-Term Plan;&#13;
(h) establish a management information system (MIS) at each regional&#13;
office of the consultant and the Project Management Unit at&#13;
headquarters which would also be the headquarters's office of the&#13;
consultant. The purpose of the MIS is for monitoring of physical&#13;
and financial progress, and recording of relevant data needed for&#13;
carrying out the evaluation study; and&#13;
(i) give the necessary support to ensure that community participation&#13;
in O&amp;M is ensured and effective. This would involve working&#13;
closely with NGOs and the elected members of the local government.&#13;
Particularly the consultant would be involved in the formation of&#13;
landless and destitute groups to undertake maintenance activities.&#13;
12.       Afforestation Development is critical to the security of the&#13;
embankment. It is cost effective and replaces the high cost option of block&#13;
revetment works which in the past have not been effective. Afforestation of&#13;
the embankment and foreshore is included in the program. The planting of&#13;
selected species of trees on the slopes of the embankment would commence after&#13;
the completion of earthworks in resectioned and new embankments. Efforts are&#13;
being made to organize on a pilot basis planting on embankments in a few PWP&#13;
polders (40 ha) and on the foreshores (80 ha). Forestry models have been&#13;
prepared. Initial nursery development would be carried out in FY96. It is&#13;
hoped that the consultant for PWP, with sub-contracted NGOs, would implement&#13;
the pilot schemes and nursery development in the second half of 1995. This&#13;
would provide an opportunity to ascertain the communities interest in the&#13;
afforestation component within a social forestry concept. The specialist&#13;
forestry team of the consultant would review the forestry models and, if&#13;
possible, in the context of experience gained from the pilot schemes and their&#13;
site experience, recommend changes to ensure effective development of&#13;
afforestation. Specifically the forestry team of the consultant would be&#13;
required to carry out the following responsibilities:&#13;
(a)  For the embankment afforestation, the forestry team would:&#13;
(i) review proposals for afforestation in the context of technical&#13;
and organizational feasibility and recommend changes as needed to&#13;
the proposed plan; (ii) make a firm schedule for afforestation of&#13;
the ten PWP polders; and (iii) review the construction schedule for&#13;
resectioning and new embankment construction and recommend changes&#13;
as needed to the afforestation schedule (Annex 4 of the Staff&#13;
Appraisal Report), updating this as construction work progresses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 10 of 26&#13;
As embankment afforestation is to be carried out by families&#13;
(Annexes 3, 4, and 5 of the Staff Appraisal Report), the schedule&#13;
for planting would depend on the resettlement program. Given the&#13;
need to forest the slopes at the earliest opportunity to protect&#13;
the embankment from erosion, and to generate income for resettled&#13;
families prior to the physical resettlement, the selected families&#13;
should be mobilized as soon as possible to carry out planting;&#13;
(b) It is proposed to plant vetiver grass along the edges of the crest&#13;
of the embankment in a pilot area, and depending upon the results&#13;
to select vetiver or other hedge row species for use in the general&#13;
model. Longer term experiments would determine whether the canopy&#13;
would allow sufficient sunlight to penetrate to permit use of&#13;
vetiver on other portions of the embankment. The forestry team&#13;
would supervise these experiments and develop appropriate programs&#13;
based on the results of these experiments;&#13;
(c) for the foreshore afforestation, the forestry team would, using the&#13;
foreshore topographical, tidal and forestry polder maps prepared by&#13;
BWDB and Forest Department (FD) and, after site visits, review the&#13;
foreshore afforestation proposals in association with the FD and&#13;
NGOs. Changes as needed would be proposed in the implementation&#13;
schedule. During the maintenance phase, the consultants would also&#13;
observe conditions and make recommendations as appropriate;&#13;
(d) in order to prepare detailed plans for the planting of individual&#13;
embankment and foreshore sites, NGOs would undertake a&#13;
participative rural appraisal (PRA) exercise in each polder. The&#13;
consultants would assist in planning and coordinating this PRA and&#13;
will actively participate in the field work. The consultants would&#13;
review the PRA reports for each polder and assist NGOs, FD and BWDB&#13;
in formulation of detailed afforestation plans;&#13;
(e) The consultants would assess the seedling requirements for each&#13;
polder and identify existing sources of seedling supply. Together&#13;
with the FD and NGOs, they would plan the development of any&#13;
additional nurseries that are required with, as far as possible,&#13;
responsibility for nursery operation (other than for mangroves)&#13;
being given to NGOs who would assist landless people to establish&#13;
nursery operations. The consultants would also advise on&#13;
appropriate nursery methods and identify sources of improved tree&#13;
seed.&#13;
(f) The consultant's forestry team would identify training needs in&#13;
forestry for NGO staff and project participants. Together with the&#13;
consultant's training coordinator, they would specify the content&#13;
of training courses and help select appropriate training personnel.&#13;
(g) The consultants would review applications for disbursement for&#13;
afforestation and certify the quantity and quality of work&#13;
performed.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 11 of 26&#13;
13.       Community Involvement.  The main facilitator in involving the&#13;
community in afforestation and improved O&amp;M would be NGOs operating at the&#13;
polder level. Given the diversity of activities in which NGOs will be&#13;
involved (mobilization, organization of groups and individuals for O&amp;M,&#13;
afforestation and tree maintenance) and the diversity of coastal areas and&#13;
conditions, it is anticipated that BWDB and FD would each sign a separate&#13;
contract for each polder for BWDB's responsibilities for embankment&#13;
maintenance and afforestation and FD's responsibilities for foreshore&#13;
afforestation and assistance in nursery establishment. This implies that up&#13;
to 42 different NGOs could be involved, although FD and BWDB would attempt to&#13;
the extent possible to select the same NGO in a particular polder.&#13;
Standardization of contracts and coordination will be required to guarantee&#13;
quality and continuity of services provided. The consultant's rural&#13;
development team, with inputs from the engineering team, would provide close&#13;
support for these NGOs, as well as assisting the implementing agencies in&#13;
community development efforts. Specifically, the consultant would be required&#13;
to:&#13;
(a) assist in the selection and contracting of NGOs to participate in&#13;
project implementation. In discussion with BWDB, FD and&#13;
prospective NGOs, refine the scope of activities and&#13;
responsibilities. Review and make recommendations on applications&#13;
from NGOs, and on the criteria used to select NGOs.&#13;
(b) coordinate and assist NGOs in planning and carrying out a&#13;
participative rural appraisal (PRA) exercise in each polder to plan&#13;
in detail the implementation of the afforestation component.&#13;
Advise on the methodology for PRA, and on how social and cultural&#13;
factors can be assessed and incorporated into the afforestation&#13;
plan. Participate in as many PRA teams as manpower allows.&#13;
(c) review the results of the PRA, and assist NGOs in developing a&#13;
programme to support afforestation, O&amp;M and other activities.&#13;
Together with NGOs draw up a detailed work plan covering all&#13;
aspects of NGOs' activities on individual polders, and including&#13;
cost budgets. Assist in establishing community groups to carry out&#13;
periodic maintenance activities and foreshore afforestation.&#13;
(d) help NGOs prepare proposals for activities to be financed from a&#13;
Community Development Fund (CDF) to be established in association&#13;
with the project, monitor the impact of the fund and make&#13;
recommendations concerning future disbursements. This fund is&#13;
intended to provide resources to implement supporting poverty&#13;
alleviation programs aimed at strengthening project activities and&#13;
group cohesion. This may involve water supplies and sanitary&#13;
facilities for embankment settlers, training and education&#13;
programmes, and income generating activities. The latter could in&#13;
particular aim at processing and marketing of project outputs such&#13;
as coconuts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 12 of 26&#13;
(e) monitor the progress of: (i) land acquisition and the payment of&#13;
compensation to project affected persons; and (ii) the resettlement&#13;
of embankment squatters at the toe of the embankment.&#13;
(f) identify training requirements for NGO staff, and assist in the&#13;
training of NGOs in project planning, community mobilization and&#13;
group formation activities;&#13;
(g) monitor and coordinate NGO activities and assist in their relations&#13;
with BWDB and FD. The consultant will establish a monitoring&#13;
system involving a simple monthly reporting form for individual&#13;
polders linked to a computerized MIS at the zonal or headquarters&#13;
level. This will record NGO activities, measure progress against&#13;
agreed workplans, and identify constraints and bottlenecks. If an&#13;
NGO fails to perform satisfactorily, then the consultant will&#13;
recommend remedial measures which may include termination of its&#13;
contract.&#13;
14.       Agricultural Development. The consultants would aim to facilitate&#13;
changes in farming practice to take advantages of the improved conditions&#13;
created by the construction of project embankments. They would liaise with&#13;
the Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP) and other programs in the&#13;
area working on improving agricultural production. In the first year of&#13;
implementation an in depth study of the project area would be carried out and,&#13;
in consultation with the specialists in the ASSP unit, a detailed proposal for&#13;
assisting farmers in the area to take advantage of new opportunities resulting&#13;
from the project would be prepared. The program would include the work to be&#13;
done during project years two to four, and may include adaptive research&#13;
trials and changes to extension messages. The consultants would supervise&#13;
implementation of the programme during this period.&#13;
15.       Monitoring and Impact Assessment.  Engineering, agricultural,&#13;
socio-economic and environmental aspects would be investigated with a view to&#13;
assessing the project's impact, identifying any issues and introducing any&#13;
changes (specifically for community involvement in O&amp;M and afforestation)&#13;
during the implementation phase. This would also be useful in the design of&#13;
future projects. Specifically, the consultant would be required to carry out&#13;
the following responsibilities:&#13;
(a) Environmental assessment: the consultant would work with those&#13;
carrying out environmental monitoring activities under the ASSP and&#13;
the National Minor Irrigation Development Project to ensure that&#13;
their activities are appropriate to meet the needs of this project.&#13;
The consultants will review the findings of these and other&#13;
environmental monitoring activities and recommend any further&#13;
monitoring or mitigation measures that may be appropriate.&#13;
(b) Civil works: the monitoring of the civil works program and all&#13;
aspects of O&amp;M are adequately covered under contract management and&#13;
supervision and improved O&amp;M (paras 6 through 9 &amp; para 12).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 13 of 26&#13;
(c) Impact assessment: The bench mark studies of seventeen polders&#13;
under the CERP and PWP have been completed under the on going&#13;
System Rehabilitation Project. The conditions in the studied&#13;
polders are similar to conditions in three polders where no studies&#13;
have been done. No study was done for Patenga (polder 62) where&#13;
the conditions are not similar to the other polders. The&#13;
consultants shall review the completed studies, and collect any&#13;
additional information needed from other secondary sources and from&#13;
direct field investigations. Given the importance of the impact of&#13;
Patenga in protecting public and private properties, it would be&#13;
necessary for the consultants to carry out a bench mark survey. In&#13;
addition, consultants would liaise with the resettlement&#13;
consultants to ensure adequate monitoring of the socio-economic&#13;
status of people losing property, housing, business or employment&#13;
as a result of the project.&#13;
(d) The consultant would then undertake sample surveys in order to&#13;
assess the effectiveness of project activities and their impact on:&#13;
(i) agriculture, farm incomes, farm level employment for different&#13;
categories of people (land owners, share croppers, landless,&#13;
destitute women); (ii) income of people involved in embankment&#13;
maintenance activities, and in embankment and foreshore&#13;
afforestation; and (iii) beneficiaries of activities funded by the&#13;
Community Development Fund. Surveys will also aim to get an&#13;
insight into: (i) any problems of squatters and unauthorized&#13;
cultivation of embankment slopes; and (ii) access by all sections&#13;
of the community (particularly women) to the participative&#13;
decision-making process within project groups and local&#13;
organizations.&#13;
(e) Questionnaire surveys would cover about 60 to 100 respondents per&#13;
polder, with the objective of making statistically valid&#13;
comparisons between polders or between groups of beneficiaries&#13;
(such as settlers, farmers, and earthwork laborers). If about 10&#13;
to 12 polders were covered by a survey (i.e. all PWP or all CERP&#13;
polders), then a survey would involve about 1000 respondents. It&#13;
is suggested that four such surveys are done during the project&#13;
period, with possibly three or four smaller ones (with 200 to 400&#13;
respondents) focusing more narrowly on key issues.&#13;
16.       SDecialists InDuts for SandwiD Town Protection Studies.  In&#13;
Sandwip, Polder 72, the proposed alignment for the retired embankment will not&#13;
provide protection for the town. This reflects substantial erosion which&#13;
threatens to destroy not only the existing embankment but also much of the&#13;
current area of the town. In view of this, provision is made for carrying out&#13;
studies to identify possible cost effective town protection methods. These&#13;
studies would be carried out by BWDB with assistance from the project&#13;
consultants. The consultant's responsibilities would include:&#13;
(i) preparation of a terms of reference which would involve site&#13;
investigations and surveys, modelling at the river research institute, and&#13;
estimates of the specialist staff months required and the duration and cost of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the study; (ii) specialist inputs for supervision, and technical guidance&#13;
during the study; and (iii) assistance to BWDB in preparing detailed proposals&#13;
(engineering designs and cost estimates) for implementation of the study's&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
Orcaanizational Set Up. Composition of Team and Period of Service&#13;
17.       The Headquarters's consultant team would be located in the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit's office in Chittagong, with three regional offices, four&#13;
divisional offices, and site offices at each polder. The consultant's&#13;
engineering team would be headed by the team leader, the zonal offices by&#13;
chief construction engineers, the regional offices by resident engineers and&#13;
the site offices by assistant resident engineers. The site offices would be&#13;
staffed by technical officers, with technicians to supervise construction work&#13;
and work in the field laboratories. The field laboratories would be fully&#13;
equipped with testing equipment with funds provided under the project. Where&#13;
major civil works are being executed on contracts awarded following ICB&#13;
procedures, the site offices at each polder, field laboratories, and quarters&#13;
for consultant's field staff would be provided by the contractor. The&#13;
contractor shall also provide residential buildings for the use of the&#13;
regional chief construction engineer. In polders where only minor civil works&#13;
are being executed, office space would be provided by BWDB in their existing&#13;
buildings.&#13;
18.       The team would include specialists in construction and contract&#13;
management, sociology, forestry, environmental science and agriculture. There&#13;
would be mix of internationally recruited and locally recruited personnel in&#13;
the senior management positions. All positions at the divisional and site&#13;
offices would be limited to local recruitment. It is estimated that 326 staff&#13;
months of internationally recruited and 736 staff months of locally recruited&#13;
senior specialists, 568 staff months of locally recruited junior specialists&#13;
and 1172 staff months of locally recruited technical staff would be required.&#13;
The consultant would also: (i) recruit the required field and support staff;&#13;
(ii) procure vehicles (including those for use by NGOs), boats, computers and&#13;
office equipment; and (iii) provide for incidentals such as running costs of&#13;
vehicles, maintenance of office and field equipment, office rental including&#13;
space at Headquarters for the PIU, local travelling, subsistence allowances&#13;
whilst on field visits, and consumables required in running the office.&#13;
Consultancy services are estimated to commence in early 1996 and continue June&#13;
30, 2002. Total requirements of senior and mid level staff are estimated as&#13;
follows:&#13;

(e) together with the consultant Forester, assess the seedling&#13;
requirements for each polder and identify existing sources of&#13;
seedling supply. Help in planning the development any additional&#13;
nurseries that are required. Advise on appropriate nursery methods&#13;
and identify sources of improved tree seed.&#13;
(f) identify training needs in forestry for NGO staff and project&#13;
participants. Together with the training coordinator, specify the&#13;
content of training courses and help select appropriate training&#13;
personnel.&#13;
Note: Consultants may wish to propose a different combination of activities&#13;
and inputs for the Community Development Advisor and the Social Forester. For&#13;
instance if a Social Forester is proposed who has considerable experience of&#13;
participatory rural development projects and of working with NGOs, then much&#13;
of the Community Development and Social Forestry tasks could be merged, and&#13;
the second, short term position, filled by either a more technically qualified&#13;
Forester, or a Social Institutions Specialist.&#13;
Environmental Specialist (12 months)&#13;
6.        The Environmental Specialist would make two to four short visits to&#13;
the project in project years one and two. Specifically, the consultant would&#13;
be required to evaluate existing environmental monitoring activities carried&#13;
out by the ASSP and the National Minor Irrigation Development Project. The&#13;
consultants will review the findings of these and other environmental&#13;
monitoring activities to see if their activities are appropriate to meet the&#13;
needs of environmental monitoring of this project. The consultant will&#13;
recommend any further monitoring or mitigation measures that may be&#13;
appropriate. Any further monitoring that is required will be carried out by&#13;
the locally recruited Environmentalist who is scheduled to make short inputs&#13;
over a six year period.&#13;
MonitorinQ and Evaluation SRecialist (8 months)&#13;
7.        The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Specialist will have two main&#13;
roles: (i) work with other team members to set up an operational MIS; and (ii)&#13;
provide overall guidance and supervision for sample surveys aimed at&#13;
evaluating the impact of the project on beneficiaries. In addition, the&#13;
Specialist would liaise with the resettlement consultants to ensure adequate&#13;
monitoring of the socio-economic status of people losing property, housing,&#13;
business or employment as a result of the project. Specific activities&#13;
include:&#13;
(a) The MIS will compile data on the progress of engineering works, O&amp;M&#13;
activities, afforestation and social organization. It will provide&#13;
project management with rapid information on the status of the&#13;
project in any polder. The M&amp;E Specialist will define the&#13;
requirements for the MIS and produce a system design upon which the&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 26 of 26&#13;
locally recruited Programmer/MIS specialist can build the system&#13;
using proprietary data-base software. The M&amp;E Specialist will&#13;
recommend if data entry should be carried out at the zonal or&#13;
headquarters level, and help design appropriate reporting forms for&#13;
the capture of data at a field level.&#13;
(b) Review benchmark studies carried out by the consultant responsible&#13;
for carrying out of feasibility studies financed under the SRP, and&#13;
arrange for the collection of any additional information needed&#13;
from other secondary sources and from direct field investigations.&#13;
(c) Organize sample surveys in order to assess the effectiveness and&#13;
impact of: (i) the embankments on agriculture; (ii) O&amp;M and&#13;
afforestation activities; and (iii) activities funded by the&#13;
Community Development Fund. Surveys will also aim to get an&#13;
insight into: (i) any problems of squatters and unauthorized&#13;
cultivation of embankment slopes; and (ii) access by all sections&#13;
of the community (particularly women) to the participative&#13;
decision-making process within project groups and local&#13;
organizations.&#13;
(d) The M&amp;E Specialist will draw up plans for individual surveys&#13;
including: (i) define man-power and logistical requirements;&#13;
(ii) draw up an appropriate sample design; (iii) design and test&#13;
questionnaires; and (iv) specify computer data-base design and data&#13;
analysis formats. Train and provide guidance for survey teams.&#13;
(e) Depending on the needs identified during project implementation by&#13;
the PIU, together with IDA and EC, it is proposed that about four&#13;
large surveys (involve about 1000 respondents), and three or four&#13;
smaller surveys (with 200 to 400 respondents) are carried out.&#13;
Surveys carried in the latter stages of the project will be the&#13;
sole responsibility of the locally recruited survey team as the M&amp;E&#13;
Specialist is expected to complete his inputs by project year four.&#13;

Coastal Embankment Rehabilitation Proiect&#13;
Technical Assistance for&#13;
Training of Staff and Communities in O&amp;M and Staff Development&#13;
Background&#13;
1.          Over the last decade, BWDB has undertaken a program of training to&#13;
upgrade and prepare its staff for the different jobs in the organization. The&#13;
main thrust has been on the engineering skills of the higher and middle level&#13;
staff to effectively carry out investigations, planning, design and&#13;
construction of flood control, drainage and irrigation schemes. During this&#13;
period separate training programs funded under aided projects were carried out&#13;
without any co-ordination and directed to specific needs of the project.&#13;
Several issues were identified during the preparation of the Systems&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (SRP). The critical issue were a weak training unit at&#13;
BWDB headquarters, emphasis on class room lectures, lesser importance given to&#13;
on-site training, omission of O&amp;M in the curriculum of training programs and&#13;
no efforts made to educate beneficiaries in the importance of effective&#13;
maintenance and the need for community participation in maintenance to ensure&#13;
sustainability of the project. Under the SRP Project (SRP), the headquarters&#13;
unit was strengthened with the appointment of the Director General Training&#13;
and Staff Development, a Deputy Director Staff Development, and a Deputy&#13;
Director Training Evaluation. In addition under the project, an O&amp;M training&#13;
program, directed towards the middle-and lower-staff of BWDB, and&#13;
beneficiaries, has been initiated recently. The training proposal prepared by&#13;
consultants has been approved by BWDB and the training of trainers has&#13;
commenced.&#13;
2.          The proposal for financing under CERP includes the following:&#13;
Training&#13;
(a)   identifications of training needs;&#13;
(b)   training of staff trainers;&#13;
(c)   designing training courses: (i) for BWDB staff; and (ii) for&#13;
beneficiaries and maintenance groups;&#13;
(d)   producing training materials and manuals;&#13;
(e)   implementing and evaluating training courses including cost&#13;
benefit analysis;&#13;
(f)   planning and supervision of training facility improvement;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(g)   preparing an inventory of present staff resources;&#13;
(h)   determining staff utilization and job descriptions;&#13;
(i)   developing comprehensive staffing plans;&#13;
(j)   designing measures for staff deployment;&#13;
3.          The training and staff development program under SRP is believed&#13;
to have provided a sufficient number of trainers in BWDB to undertake the&#13;
training of field staff of BWDB and beneficiaries. Staff development in BWDB,&#13;
with the exception of training in involving community participation during the&#13;
planning, construction and operational phases of projects, is comprehensively&#13;
covered under the SRP, and efforts in community participation training are&#13;
beginning. The training program proposed for CERP would build on the&#13;
activities of SRP with emphasis on the training of NGOs and beneficiaries and&#13;
improving the skills of BWDB staff to use the resources of the community to&#13;
effectively carry out maintenance activities. It would also include some of&#13;
the programs of staff training initiated under SRP, as adopted to the specific&#13;
needs of CERP.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
4.          The objectives of the training component are to:&#13;
(a)   improve the skills of BWDB staff in contract management and&#13;
supervision of construction work, O&amp;M activities, and the&#13;
effective use of community resources in maintenance activities;&#13;
works;&#13;
(b)   improve the skills of Forest Department staff in coastal and&#13;
embankment afforestation;&#13;
(c)   improve the skills of NGOs in community development activities and&#13;
train them to be able to supervise routine maintenance of&#13;
embankments and in the technical aspects of afforestation&#13;
inclusive of propagation of nurseries;&#13;
(d)   train beneficiaries in maintenance activities of embankments and&#13;
afforestation; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
Program&#13;
5.          The program would be mainly limited to in-country training and&#13;
would include:&#13;
(a)   a series of three regional workshops (Barisal/Khulna, Chittagong,&#13;
and Noakhali) to provide orientation and motivation for BWDB staff&#13;
to be involved in project implementation;&#13;
(b)   classroom based training of trainers in BWDB and the Forest&#13;
Department, and NGOs;&#13;
(c)   production of learning materials including O&amp;M, community forestry&#13;
field manuals and environmental guidelines;&#13;
(d)   on-site training of project participants and beneficiaries; and&#13;
(e)   local study tours for BWDB, Forest Department, NGOs and community&#13;
group representatives participating in maintenance and&#13;
afforestation activities.&#13;
(f)   possible short study tour to Indonesia (or other Asian country)&#13;
where NGOs have been pioneering a community approach to coastal&#13;
afforestation.&#13;
Execution&#13;
6.          Training of Trainers.  BWDB staff trained under the SRP training&#13;
program would form the nucleus of the trainers to be responsible for&#13;
conducting courses, They would initially undergo a refresher course conducted&#13;
by specialist of the implementation support and training teams of CERP. With&#13;
their inputs and the inputs of specialists as required, additional BWDB staff&#13;
and selected NGO group organizers would be trained as trainers. Course&#13;
curriculum would be similar to that used for the SRP program with emphasis&#13;
directed towards preventive activities required to ensure sustainability of&#13;
the polders. Specifically training would be: directed towards ensuring the&#13;
correct approach in imparting knowledge; subject matter-oriented, need to have&#13;
on-site courses with minimum classroom courses; on the use and effectiveness&#13;
of audio-visual methods; on designing training materials; and methods for&#13;
evaluating the on-going and new training programs. The selected trainers&#13;
during the training program would assist the training coordinator in preparing&#13;
the target groups and the number of participants in each group, number of&#13;
courses, locations and duration of training. They would also assist in the&#13;
preparation of guidelines for the methodology to be adopted in evaluating the&#13;
program.&#13;
7.          Construction, Operation and Maintenance Training.  Construction&#13;
and operation training would be limited to BWDB staff. Staff of BWDB, NGOs,&#13;
and the beneficiary communities (representatives of families, and maintenance&#13;
groups) would be trained in routine and periodic maintenance activities.&#13;
Training activities would include:&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
8.          Construction.  An intensive training program on contract&#13;
management, setting out, quality control and supervision currently in the&#13;
training program of SRP would continue to be conducted under the CERP. Upper-&#13;
and middle-level field staff of BWDB (SEs, Exens. and SDEs) would receive on-&#13;
site training in all aspects of construction, whilst SOs and Work Assistants&#13;
(WAs) would be trained in supervision, measurements and preparation of running&#13;
bills of contractors. Classroom courses would be very limited. All BWDB&#13;
staff involved in the administrative and financial management of major civil&#13;
works would be trained in this program. The specialists consultants of the&#13;
implementation support team would direct and conduct the training.&#13;
9.          Operation.  The upper-and middle-level staff of BWDB are well&#13;
experienced in operational activities. Training would be limited to SOs, WAs&#13;
and Khalashis. The responsibilities of these staff are described in great&#13;
detail in the current O&amp;M manual. Refresher courses would be conducted under&#13;
the program. Class room lectures would be conducted in each polder followed&#13;
by instructions and demonstrations at site. The main thrust would be to&#13;
educate these staff on the need for early detection of weak sections of the&#13;
embankment, signs of deterioration in structures, the importance of the post&#13;
monsoon and pre-monsoon inspection and engineering surveys and the need for&#13;
timely repairs to ensure the security of the project works; Training would be&#13;
conducted by the program trainers and inputs by upper-and middle-level staff&#13;
of BWDB.&#13;
10.         Motivation and Orientation Workshops.  A series of one day&#13;
workshops in each of three regions would be conducted by the consultant's&#13;
community development adviser in collaboration with members of the forum of&#13;
participating NGOs to provide BWDB staff with an introduction to the concept&#13;
of community participation and working with NGOs. Senior engineers of BWDB&#13;
who have acquired some experience in community participation, working with&#13;
NGOs and landless groups for embankment maintenance, would take a key role in&#13;
these workshops.&#13;
11.         Maintenance.  BWDB, NGOS and resettled families would be involved&#13;
in routine maintenance of embankments. Periodic maintenance of embankments,&#13;
structures and the drainage network is carried out during the dry season&#13;
(frequency: annually,once every two years, etc.) and the preparation of&#13;
engineering documents, measurements for preparation of bills etc. require&#13;
special engineering skills. In view of this BWDB would be responsible for&#13;
all aspects of contract management. NGOs' responsibility for periodic&#13;
maintenance would be limited to: (i) group formation; (ii) assistance to the&#13;
group to elect a group representative to sign contracts, and contract&#13;
management including administrative and financial matters. BWDB trainers&#13;
would train groups of twenty five comprising SOs, WAs and Khalashis at three&#13;
central locations in the project area. Several such courses would be&#13;
conducted during FY96 and FY97 to cover all the SOs, WAs, and Khalshis of the&#13;
twenty one polders included in the Mid Term Plan. Separate courses would be&#13;
conducted for routine and periodic maintenance. Participating NGOs would be&#13;
included in the courses for routine maintenance. Classroom followed by on-&#13;
site training at polders in each central location would be included in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
course. Curriculum would include all the routine and periodic activities&#13;
described in annex 5 and the job responsibilities described in the O&amp;M manual.&#13;
12.         Training of families to carry out routine maintenance of&#13;
embankments would be conducted by NGO group organizers (trained under the&#13;
training of trainers program). Groups of about ten resettled families would&#13;
receive on-the-job training at a time. Training will consist of 2 days on-&#13;
site work, for which participants would receive payment as part of the&#13;
standard contract with BWDB.&#13;
13.         Forestry TraininQ Module.  The social forestry training module&#13;
would be based on training of NGO and Forest Department trainers and would&#13;
emphasize practical hands-on experience, with development of graphic materials&#13;
which are suitable for working with illiterate trainees. The training module&#13;
would include the following elements:&#13;
(a)   A review of existing soeial forestry trainincr Droqrams being&#13;
developed by the Association of Development Agencies of Bangladesh&#13;
(ADAB) forum on forestry and environment (covering approach,&#13;
motivation, and mobilization) and the technical training module&#13;
developed by BARC, Winrock and Proshika which covers choice of&#13;
species and technical aspects of planting and management for&#13;
community forestry.&#13;
(b)   Development of a trainir course for NGO staff and the Forest&#13;
Rangers based on a four week course with weeks one and two in the&#13;
classroom, week three in the field working out the forestry model&#13;
for the embankment with beneficiaries and support of the Forest&#13;
Department ranger, week four back in the classroom.&#13;
(c)   Preparation and vroduction of a field manual for NGO field staff&#13;
which would provide pictures of the species, notes and symbols&#13;
suitable for use with illiterate trainees indicating appropriate&#13;
species for different locations, planting instructions,&#13;
maintenance, yield data and generalized market information.&#13;
(d)   Implementation of traininq course for two NGO staff per polder and&#13;
one forest ranger per polder initially. In collaboration with&#13;
groups of beneficiaries and the forest ranger, the trainees would&#13;
draw up an afforestation plan for a one ha plot suitable for their&#13;
own polder (guidelines given in annex 4). This would be reviewed&#13;
by the class in the final class room session.&#13;
14.         Back up support to trained group organizers, during implementation&#13;
would be provided by Forest Department rangers and the Agro-forestry team of&#13;
the implementation support consultant.&#13;
15.         Environmental Trainin .  The training module on environmental&#13;
aspects is intended to introduce the importance of environmental awareness&#13;
amongst BWDB staff and would consist of specialized courses for upper-level&#13;
staff and seminars for junior staff.&#13;
&#13;

16.         Short term sDecialized courses (2-3 weeks) in environmental and&#13;
water resources management for upper-level staff of BWDB are provided in the&#13;
program. This course will be provided by specialist trainers in Bangladesh&#13;
based on a course curriculum prepared by the environmentalist of the&#13;
implementation support team. The course should include inter alia modules on:&#13;
(a) Bangladesh natural environment; (b) hydrology and flood hydraulics in&#13;
Bangladesh; (c) aquatic environments (particularly wetlands); (d) basic&#13;
fisheries ecology (including migration and habitat requirements); (e) national&#13;
conservation issues; (f) environmental impacts of FCDI projects; and (g) the&#13;
principles of environmental impact assessment, management and monitoring. It&#13;
is expected that trainees would also become familiar with the institutional&#13;
framework for environmental management of the country.&#13;
17.         The course would also include a component on socio-economic&#13;
aspects of FCDI projects which will increase awareness amongst BWDB staff of&#13;
the socio-economic implications of such projects. The course would provide&#13;
information on socio-economic survey techniques, the socio-economic impacts of&#13;
FCDI projects and the management of resettlement and compensation issues.&#13;
18.         The principal aim of these courses will be develop within senior&#13;
staff a wider awareness of water resources issues so that environmental and&#13;
social issues can be considered at all stages of FCDI projects (planning to&#13;
implementation and O&amp;M). It is expected that this will minimize the potential&#13;
for adverse impacts to arise in future FCDI projects.&#13;
19.         A series of seminars for the junior staff of BWDB would also be&#13;
provided to build on and deepen the environmental awareness raising which&#13;
would be completed under the SRP training module. The seminars will contain&#13;
information of a similar nature to the short term courses listed above. The&#13;
environmentalist should discuss the detailed course content with appropriate&#13;
SRP and BWDB staff.&#13;
Technical Assistance Recuirements&#13;
20.         In addition  to the inputs to be provided by the specialist team&#13;
of the implementation support component and financing required to carry out&#13;
the training activities, a consultancy unit under the direction of the team&#13;
leader of the implementation support team, would carry out specific tasks in&#13;
the training program. An internationally recruited training coordinator (12&#13;
staff months) to be employed up to the third year, would be responsible for:&#13;
(a) reviewing the existing training programs; (b) a detailed assessment of the&#13;
training needs of the project and the existing resources; (c) design and&#13;
implementation of training courses for trainers; (d) specialist advice and&#13;
supervision of training courses inclusive of production of training materials;&#13;
(e) development of indicators for monitoring the success of the programs.&#13;
During the fourth to sixth years, the team leader would direct all activities&#13;
of the training program. In addition to the internationally recruited&#13;
engineering specialists, the community development adviser, the environmental&#13;
scientist, the forester and the O&amp;M specialist would assist him in these&#13;
activities.&#13;

Crop Production and Incomes&#13;
A. General&#13;
1.          Estimation of the project's expected impact on agricultural&#13;
production and farm incomes has been based on a detailed analysis of farming&#13;
practices and agro-ecological conditions in each of the 11 polders with major&#13;
works financed under the project. Each of the polders has been considered as&#13;
a sub-project. The analysis, based on a one hectare farm model, has been done&#13;
separately for each polder because of differences such as management&#13;
practices, intensity of input use, soil quality, yields and cropping patterns&#13;
between polders in the area covered by the project. Prevention of salinity&#13;
intrusions and storm surges and improved drainage conditions in the polders&#13;
during normal monsoons and cyclones would lead to increased agricultural&#13;
production. Higher output would come from changes in cropping patterns and&#13;
intensity and improved crop yields. In projecting the impact of the project&#13;
on agricultural production, account is taken of the small amount of land lost&#13;
to production due to project related land acquisition in areas where&#13;
embankment retirement is necessary. Account is also taken of further&#13;
retirement of sections of the embankments in Polders 59/2 (Ramgati) and 72&#13;
(Sandwip) expected to be required in year 15 due to erosion.&#13;
B. Cropping Patterns and Intensity&#13;
3.          The predominant crop in the area covered by the project is the low&#13;
yielding local variety (Lv) of T. Aman. B. Aus (LV) is the second major crop&#13;
in the area. B. Aman is also important in some of the polders. A range of&#13;
other crops such as pulses, oilseeds, millet, cowpea, chilli, sweet potatoes,&#13;
jute, and vegetables are grown during the rabi (winter) season. Adoption of&#13;
high yielding varieties (HYVs) of rice is limited in these polders because of&#13;
high soil and water salinity as these varieties have little or no tolerance to&#13;
salinity. All current HYV production is expected to switch to local varieties&#13;
within two years in the absence of the project given the present condition of&#13;
the embankments. Rehabilitation of the embankments would prevent salinity&#13;
intrusions and storm surges and thus bring about changes in the cropping&#13;
pattern. The present and expected cropping patterns in the "with project" and&#13;
"without project" scenarios are detailed polder by polder in Tables 1-11.&#13;
With protection against saline water and improvement of drainage conditions,&#13;
increased cultivation of HYVs of rice is expected to occur. The increased&#13;
security to be provided by the rehabilitated embankments would encourage the&#13;
investment in higher input levels required for HYV production. With the&#13;
project, between 20 and 40% of T. Aman area is expected to shift to HYV in the&#13;
kharif season 1, depending upon the degree of sharecropping in each polder,&#13;
since the incentives to sharecroppers to shift to HYV are much diminished.&#13;
1.    Summer cropping season (May through November).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -                            ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
During the rabi season 2, HYV boro cultivation is expected to increase only&#13;
in Polder 66/1 where fresh underground water is available for irrigation.&#13;
Cultivation of HYVs of other rabi crops such as water melon and betel leaf&#13;
would also increase in the "with project" situation, especially in the polders&#13;
in Cox's Bazar area such as Polder 66/1 and Polder 68. It is also expected&#13;
that more land would come under diversified crops (pulses, oilseeds, chillies,&#13;
winter vegetables, and sweet potatoes) in the rabi season due to reduced soil&#13;
salinity. Changes in the cropping pattern are expected to be realized over a&#13;
period of seven years.&#13;
4.          Cropping intensity in the project area under the present&#13;
conditions ranges from 108% (Polder 35/1) to 174% (Polder 72), the average&#13;
being 136t. The national average is about 150%. Saline soil conditions limit&#13;
crop cultivation during the dry season. The project is expected to increase&#13;
cropping intensity in the area to the national average because of increased&#13;
area under both kharif and rabi crops. The area under kharif crops would&#13;
increase due to protection from flooding as well as improved drainage while&#13;
the area under rabi crops would increase as a result of soil salinity&#13;
reduction. Cropping intensity is expected to range from about 130% (Polder&#13;
73/1A&amp;B) to 210% (Polder 66/1), the average being 155%, in the "with project"&#13;
scenario.&#13;
5.          Aside from the yield gains from switching to HYV and increased&#13;
cropping intensity, yield per season for the same crops would also increase,&#13;
due to reduction in salinity, improvement in drainage conditions during the&#13;
kharif season, and protection against flooding caused by heavy rainfall during&#13;
normal monsoons or cyclone surges. An increase of 10-15% in yield is&#13;
expected, the level depending on crop varieties and specific conditions in a&#13;
given polder. In the absence of the project, yields for most crops would&#13;
remain low or decline to the levels observed outside the embankments. Due to&#13;
the effects of salinity intrusions through existing breaches in the&#13;
embankments or areas where breaches are imminent, and poor drainage and&#13;
flooding, it is anticipated that in the "without project" situation the&#13;
average yield of local varieties of rice would be reduced over a period of&#13;
five years to about one ton per hectare, which is the average yield of T. Aman&#13;
under saline conditions. Anticipated changes in crop yields under "with&#13;
project" and "without project" compared with the present conditions are also&#13;
detailed in Tables 1-12.&#13;
C. Crop Production&#13;
6.          Expected annual crop production under present, "without project"&#13;
and "with project" situations are also detailed in Tables 1-11 by polder.&#13;
Estimated annual incremental crop production is expected to range from about&#13;
20% (Polder 70) to 110% (Polder 40/2), the average being about 55%. Annual&#13;
production, at full development, with the project is expected to increase by&#13;
about 87,700 metric tons on average over the "without project" situation.&#13;
This production estimate is based on a net cultivable land of about 49,900&#13;
hectares in the polders protected by the 11 embankments included under the&#13;
major works program and excludes the cultivable land protected under the&#13;
2.    Winter cropping season (November through May).&#13;
&#13;

-154-                            ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
Priority Works Project or by the two Km of embankment improvements provided&#13;
for polder 60.3 The expected increase in production would be higher if not&#13;
for the constraints that the farmers will still face. These constraints&#13;
include limited fresh water for irrigation during the dry season, unfavorable&#13;
tenancy agreements4 that discourage tenant farmers from investing in land&#13;
improvement and intensive cultivation, existence of absentee/large land owners&#13;
who do not pay much attention to crop intensification, and poor quality of&#13;
draught animals and shortage of mechanical cultivators for land preparation.&#13;
These constraints have been taken into account when projecting the increase in&#13;
crop production. The target production is expected to be achieved in seven&#13;
years' time when the projected changes in cropping pattern and intensity will&#13;
have been realized.&#13;
D. Farm Incomes&#13;
7.          The project's effect on annual farm incomes in the area has been&#13;
analyzed through the use of one hectare farm models prepared for each of the&#13;
11 polders. Prices of all inputs and outputs are based on constant 1994&#13;
farmgate prices (see Annex 11, Tables 1 and 2). Details on these prices are&#13;
discussed in Annex 11, para 1 (c). The cash flows are in constant 1991 taka.&#13;
Farm budgets detailing input use, costs of production, gross value of&#13;
production, and net income per hectare for each polder are shown in Tables 12-&#13;
23. The results show that investment in the project would increase incomes of&#13;
farm families in the area substantially. The average net increase in income&#13;
from one hectare farms would range from about 20% (Polder 59/2) to 110l&#13;
(Polder 35/1). In value terms, the range would be from about Taka 2,100&#13;
(Polder 73/lA&amp;B) to Taka 11,300 (Polder 66/1). The average increase in net&#13;
income from a one hectare farm for all the polders would be about Taka 5,200&#13;
or 47%. The increase is expected to be higher in polders in Cox's Bazar&#13;
district, where intensive cropping is practiced, than in polders in Burguna or&#13;
Bagerhat districts. The additional farm incomes would also benefit tenants&#13;
and landless laborers, in addition to benefiting owner-operators. The&#13;
percentage share of the benefits is not expected to differ substantially from&#13;
the present arrangements. Everybody would gain in proportion to present&#13;
income levels.&#13;
3.    Polder 60, where project civil works include only 2 Km of embankment&#13;
strengthening plus khal excavation, is excluded from the analysis. More&#13;
time is required to test the effectiveness of recently completed anti-&#13;
erosion works before firm estimates can be justified.&#13;
4.    Thirty to forty percent of rural households operate land under different&#13;
tenancy arrangements, the most widespread being sharecropping under which&#13;
the tenant agrees to bear all costs and pays 50% of gross output to the&#13;
landlord. The agreement is usually for one crop season.&#13;

Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    There are two major categories of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) under the&#13;
proposed project:&#13;
(a)   Squatters living on existing embankments being repaired under the&#13;
project; and&#13;
(b)   People affected by land acquisition for project facilities.&#13;
About 675 ha is to be acquired under the project consisting of (a) about 270 ha of land in&#13;
areas where embankments have to be retired due to the effects of erosion on existing&#13;
embankments; (b) about 175 ha for repair of existing embankments, of which about half&#13;
is for acquisition of land under one existing embankment where the land had previously&#13;
been made available on a voluntary basis, without transfer of ownership, and the&#13;
remainder is land required for widening of existing embankments; (c) about 55 ha for&#13;
new drainage structures; (d) about 35 ha for minor works (excluding khal excavation);&#13;
(e) about 35 ha for resettlement of embankment squatters and other landless people; and&#13;
(f) about 105 ha to be leased for three years in strips of 10 meters width on each bank of&#13;
kahls, as spoil dump areas for khal excavation.&#13;
2.    Paras. 2.12 and 2.16 of the SAR describes the program under which about 700&#13;
families presently squatting on embankment sections to be rehabilitated and about 1300&#13;
other landless families would be allocated an area of the embankment of about 1 ha each&#13;
(smaller areas in sections of two polders) for which they would be responsible for&#13;
afforestation and routine embankment maintenance. Each of these families would also be&#13;
allocated a homestead plot of 10 m. by 20 m. at the inland toe of the embankment. They&#13;
would be paid by BWDB on a declining scale for these services for about four years by&#13;
which time the value of the produce from their trees and their homestead plots is expected&#13;
to be sufficient to provide an adequate income. It is expected that most of the squatters&#13;
required to move to permit rehabilitation of embankments would opt to move&#13;
immediately to new homes at the back of the homestead plots, which would still allow&#13;
contractors enough room on the berm for construction activities. Alternatively, they&#13;
would be given the option of a rental allowance for about one year to cover the costs of&#13;
temporarily renting a plot or a house during construction. Squatters would be provided a&#13;
house construction grant sufficient to cover the costs of movement and erection of&#13;
shiftable materials from the prior house and purchase and erection of non-shiftable&#13;
materials for the new house. A squatter census report was produced in August 1993 by&#13;
the consultants employed for the PWP project. The resettlement consultants, assisted by&#13;
NGOs, would formally register the eligible PAPs, and would include any new squatters&#13;
up to the date of the new survey.&#13;

3.    On about 3.7 km of embankment near Sandwip town and about 4 km near&#13;
Ramgati a variation of the above arrangements would be made for squatter families with&#13;
work or family connections requiring them to live near town. A continuous berm would&#13;
be constructed to accommodate about 1 00 families near Sandwip and 80 families near&#13;
Ramgati. Groups would be organized to take responsibility for embankment afforestation&#13;
and maintenance, with each family responsible for the maintenance and receiving the&#13;
benefit of the produce from a smaller area than in the standard model (perhaps 1/4 to 1/8&#13;
ha). This would not be expected to provide a subsistence income but (together with the&#13;
produce from the homestead plot) would supplement their current sources of income.&#13;
Impact of Land Acquisition&#13;
4.    Land acquisition in Bangladesh in the past has caused severe adverse impacts on&#13;
affected people, for the following reasons:&#13;
(a)   the level of compensation for land has generally been far below the market&#13;
value of the lost properties;&#13;
(b)   Compensation has frequently been delayed;&#13;
(c)   Because of the small average land holdings in Bangladesh, people are&#13;
extremely vulnerable to losses of productive land; and&#13;
(d)   Some categories of affected people have not been compensated.&#13;
5.   In compliance with the principles of the Bank's Operational Directive 4.30, a&#13;
resettlement action plan (RAP) has been prepared for the project, which addresses the&#13;
above-mentioned problems. The main challenges of this plan have been to: (a) develop&#13;
an improved mechanism for valuation of land; (b) develop policies which adequately&#13;
address the need for restoring income levels of agriculture-based households; (c) identify&#13;
and define non-property owners in need of assistance; and (d) provide an adequate and&#13;
fair grievance mechanism.&#13;
6.    A socio-economic survey has been carried out by consultants (Bangladesh&#13;
Institute of Development Studies staff members) of the land to be acquired for&#13;
embankment retirement. This study covered a total of 236 ha of land required as&#13;
compared to about 270 now estimated to be required for embankment retirement, taking&#13;
account of changes in alignment due to erosion and the addition of a section of one polder&#13;
not completed under the PWP program. This survey aimed to:&#13;
(i)   produce a comprehensive listing of all PAPs;&#13;
(ii)   ascertain the socio-economic status of PAPs;&#13;
(iii) make a complete list of all losses suffered by PAPs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 181 -                          ANNEX9&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
(iv)  gather data on the prevailing market price of land;&#13;
(v)   elicit PAPs' views on compensation levels and modalities.&#13;
7.    Data from the complete census of PAPs has been entered into a computer data-&#13;
base and two listings produced for each of the 10 polders. One of these contains tables&#13;
showing informnation on each plot, referenced by the plot number from the mouza map.&#13;
The second contains a data sheet for each individual PAP. Although the information in&#13;
these print-outs is quite comprehensive, further information would need to be accessed&#13;
directly from the data-base. For instance, although PAP data sheets show the value of&#13;
losses of assets, such as houses and trees, information on the type, size and unit value of&#13;
each house or tree (which is needed to determine the overall value of the asset) is not&#13;
shown. Plot data tables only give information on the land owner, and details of tenants&#13;
can only be obtained from the computer.&#13;
8.    To retire a total of 65 km of embankment in 10 CERP polders, a total of 236 ha of&#13;
land will need to be acquired. Of this, 27 ha is khas (public) land, the remaining 209 ha&#13;
consisting of 2,448 plots of private land owned or occupied by 1 ,148 households. On&#13;
average the affected households lose 0.18 ha or about 1 1% of their land holdings. In&#13;
many cases the value and productivity of their remaining land would increase due to the&#13;
protection provided by the embankment. The total number of families rendered landless&#13;
due to this land acquisition would be four (all earning their livelihood outside of&#13;
agriculture). In addition to agricultural land, about 12% of PAPs would lose homestead&#13;
land, 11% buildings, 2% shops or mills, 16% trees, 3% fishponds, and 1% salt beds.&#13;
There is little sharecropping in the project area, but there are some longer term tenants.&#13;
9.    The remaining land to be acquired under the project is similar to that surveyed&#13;
above, except that in most cases the amount of land to be taken from any one PAP (e.g.&#13;
for widening existing embankments) would be less.&#13;
Compensation Policy&#13;
10.   The policies and mechanisms developed in the RAP are primarily cash-based,&#13;
with the exception of support for relocation of squatters (described in para 2 above). It is&#13;
recognized that land-for-land compensation is not feasible nor desirable with the&#13;
acquisition of long strips of land (right-of-way). Most farmers will lose only parts of&#13;
their holdings and will prefer not to move, and cannot make use of land allocated by the&#13;
Government somewhere else. The primary focus of the policy is therefore on adequate&#13;
cash compensation. Within this framework, GOB has agreed to: (a) offer compensation&#13;
for properties/assets based on their replacement value; (b) include compensation and&#13;
assistance to affected non-property owners; (c) compensate for relocation costs; and&#13;
(d) provide compensation for temporary loss of income. These provisions meet the&#13;
requirements of Operational Directive 4.30 with respect to resettlement and rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 182 -ANNEX9&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
11.   The following types of losses are recognized under the compensation and&#13;
resettlement policy:&#13;
(a)   agricultural or commercial land, including usufruct rights existing for&#13;
more than one year;&#13;
(b)   homestead land;&#13;
(c)   standing crop;&#13;
(d)   living quarters or other physical structures (including buildings used for&#13;
commercial or industrial activities);&#13;
(e)   trees or fish ponds;&#13;
(f)   income from displaced commercial or industrial activities;&#13;
(g)   regular wage income; and&#13;
(h)   occupied homestead land (either unauthorized use of Government land or&#13;
use of private land with owner's permission).&#13;
12.   Definition of the persons recognized as having these losses (i.e., entitled persons),&#13;
level/form of compensation and assistance offered, and specific guidelines for calculating&#13;
compensation are presented in the compensation and resettlement policy in the RAP (see&#13;
attachment.) The policy commitments and institutional arrangements reflected in this&#13;
policy matrix will be translated into Bangla and distributed to the affected people during&#13;
joint verification. In addition, local level information meetings will be arranged where&#13;
the text of the Bangla brochure will be explained publicly, both to the PAPs and to the&#13;
implementing functionaries at the field level. The concerned BWDB staff will request&#13;
the Union Council Chairmen to convene such meetings.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
13.   Land and other properties will be acquired under the Acquisition and Requisition&#13;
of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982. Under this Ordinance, the Deputy&#13;
Commissioner's (DC's) office is the acquiring body acting on behalf of the implementing&#13;
agency (in this case BWDB). The ordinance specifies that in determining the market&#13;
value of property, the DC shall take into account the average value of similar properties&#13;
in the vicinity sold during the preceding twelve months. Since such values are frequently&#13;
understated for tax avoidance reasons, the compensation values resulting from these&#13;
computations of recorded market prices were normally below the real market values of&#13;
the property. In consideration of this problems, the Ordinance was amended in&#13;
September 1993 to raise the premium on the calculated market value of property "in&#13;
consideration of the compulsory nature of the acquisition" from 20% to 50%.&#13;
Notwithstanding the increase in the premiums over recorded values, compensation for&#13;
property based on computed values could still, in some cases, be less than replacement&#13;
value. In addition, the ordinance does not fully cover all categories of loss by PAPs. The&#13;
excess of entitlements in the agreed matrix over what is paid by the DCs would be&#13;
financed from the project budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 183 -                         ANNEX9&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
14.   Land acquisition and resettlement activities would be managed by the Project&#13;
Resettlement Unit of the PIU, located in Chittagong, and headed by a Deputy Director&#13;
Resettlement. Work would be carried out by four subunits established by Cox's Bazaar,&#13;
Chittagong, Noahkhali, and Barisal. Each subunit has Regional Project Resettlement&#13;
Officers, Revenue Officers, an Accountant, and a Surveyor. Special Land Acquisition&#13;
Officers deputed to the Deputy Commissioners have been appointed at Cox's Bazaar,&#13;
Chittagong, and Laxmipur to assist the Deputy Commissioners in dealing with polders&#13;
with large numbers of affected people. Entitlements beyond those specified under the&#13;
law would be paid by the Project Resettlement Unit. The consultants who prepared the&#13;
draft resettlement plan with regard to land to be acquired for embankment retirement have&#13;
been contracted to use their data base from their survey to assist the DCs and the Project&#13;
Resettlement Unit to establish entitlements for land required for the first year of&#13;
construction. The resettlement consultants have subcontracted with NGOs active in the&#13;
project areas to work with people affected by land acquisition, verify payments, and&#13;
participate in grievance committees. Following credit signature, it is expected that the&#13;
contract of the resettlement consultants would be extended to cover land required for&#13;
subsequent construction years.&#13;
15.   All payments to PAPs will be made in the presence of a BWDB representative of&#13;
the rank of Subdivisional Engineer or above. Grievance Redressal Committees,&#13;
consisting of a representative of the DC, a BWDB Subdivisional Engineer, the local&#13;
Union Parishad Chairman, and a representative of the resettlement NGO, would be&#13;
formed for each of the four resettlement subunits. (Additional members such as a teacher&#13;
at a local educational institute and a BWDB Section Officer may be added, if needed,&#13;
while maintaining the ratio of committee members from government departments at 50%&#13;
or less.) These committees will be formed within two months of the establishment of the&#13;
resettlement subunits and shall commence hearing grievances within a week of issuance&#13;
of details of PAP entitlements following joint verification. Grievances may be brought to&#13;
the attention of either the resettlement NGO or the resettlement subunit. These&#13;
committees are expected to meet regularly to hear grievances at least once every two&#13;
weeks, at a place and time publicized to the PAPs.&#13;
Timing&#13;
16.   The Notice under Section 3 of the Ordinance notifying the public of plots&#13;
proposed for acquisition for the first year's construction program was given in mid-&#13;
August. A joint verification exercise to assess individual claims, using data provided by&#13;
the socio-economic survey, has been initiated for the first year's required land. The&#13;
committee carrying out this exercise includes representatives of the resettlement NGOs.&#13;
Finalization of the Joint Verification Report and determination of award amounts are&#13;
scheduled to be completed by the end of October. (For the one polder where it is&#13;
necessary to start on resectioning during the first construction season, the work will&#13;
proceed one month later, combining survey of PAPs and registration of squatters on the&#13;
embankment.) Payment of compensation in accordance with the compensation policy is&#13;
scheduled to be completed by January 31, with land to be handed over to contractors by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 184 -                         ANNEX9&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
March 1. The compensation policy includes extra payment for each week by which the&#13;
period between compensation and eviction is less than 12 weeks.&#13;
17.   Following credit signature, similar procedures would start for the land required for&#13;
the second and subsequent year's construction program. This includes updating of the&#13;
squatter survey and carrying out of socio-economic surveys of:&#13;
(a)   areas where as a result of subsequent erosion the alignments of&#13;
embankments to be retired have been modified since the original survey;&#13;
(b)   areas required for embankment rehabilitation, including land needed along&#13;
side existing embankments for embankment widening, and land&#13;
underneath one existing embankment which had been provided by the&#13;
owners on a voluntary basis without compensation;&#13;
(c)   areas required completion of PWP works;&#13;
(d)   areas required for homestead plots for settlers on the toe of the&#13;
embankment; and&#13;
(e)   areas required for minor rehabilitation and improvement works.&#13;
1 8.   The resettlement consultants would also carry out a sample survey of PAPs who&#13;
have received compensation, to determine the impact of land acquisition on their socio-&#13;
economic situation. The monitoring and evaluation specialist of the general project&#13;
consultants would liaise with the resettlement consultants to ensure adequate monitoring&#13;
of the PAPs. Under the allowance for contingencies in the provision for resettlement&#13;
costs, additional NGO self-help or training programs would be provided to any category&#13;
of PAPs identified by the survey as requiring such services.&#13;

COASTAL EMBANKMENT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Analysis&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.        An environmental assessment of the Coastal Embankment&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (CERP) was undertaken by environmental consultants&#13;
financed by the European Commission. The report concluded that the overall&#13;
environmental impact of the project is positive. The expected impacts on&#13;
agriculture, fisheries, and the socio-economic status of the population in the&#13;
project area will be significantly positive in most respects. The consultants&#13;
concluded that there is adequate scope for mitigation of virtually all the&#13;
identified adverse environmental and social impacts of the project and&#13;
recommended mitigating measures and arrangements for impact monitoring. This&#13;
environmental annex summarizes the consultants' main findings.&#13;
B. Potential Environmental Impacts&#13;
2.        The potential environmental impacts were considered and likely&#13;
impacts were then characterized in terms of their scope, duration, probability&#13;
of occurrence, significance and other appropriate factors. An attempt to&#13;
characterize project impacts is summarized in Table 1. Since many of the&#13;
potential positive and negative impacts are inter-related, could occur&#13;
simultaneously amongst differing social groups and to a certain extent, negate&#13;
each other, they were grouped and considered under the following headings:&#13;
Agriculture.&#13;
Fisheries.&#13;
Socio-economics.&#13;
Miscellaneous.&#13;
This will allow a greater appreciation of the relative environmental costs and&#13;
benefits of the project.&#13;
Agriculture&#13;
3.        Two of the greatest constraints on agriculture in the coastal strip&#13;
are the salinisation of soil and flood damage due to incursion of saline and&#13;
tidal fresh waters. One of the main aims of the project is to offer greater&#13;
protection to coastal areas from high tide levels and cyclone surges. In the&#13;
post-construction years one would expect to see a decline in soil salinity&#13;
and flood recurrence and intensity. This would result in an increase in the&#13;
farmers confidence that investments in agriculture will be secure. It is&#13;
widely expected that these changes will manifest themselves as agricultural&#13;
intensification and increases in yields and incomes.&#13;

4.        Predictions of the changes that will occur in cropping patterns&#13;
have been made by the project preparation consultants and reviewed by the IDA&#13;
appraisal mission. Generally, it appears that the percentage of cropped area&#13;
under single cropping will decline and the area that is double cropped will&#13;
increase. It is not likely that the area which is triple cropped will&#13;
increase substantially. It is estimated that over a period of five years from&#13;
completion of civil works, between 20% and 40% of the current T. Aman area&#13;
would shift to HYV in the Kharif season. Conversion would be at the high end&#13;
of the range in those polders with comparatively low levels of absentee&#13;
ownership and share cropping. During the rabi season, however, HYV boro&#13;
cultivation is expected to increase in only one polder due to the lack of&#13;
fresh water for irrigation in other areas.&#13;
5.        The sources of environmental impact which are generally associated&#13;
with agricultural intensification are as follows:&#13;
Increased use of agrochemicals.&#13;
Depletion of existing surface water resources within polders&#13;
for supplementary irrigation.&#13;
Increased use of improved seed varieties and the abandonment&#13;
of traditional local varieties.&#13;
Increased Use of Agrochemicals&#13;
6.        Intensification of agriculture is usually accompanied by increased&#13;
use of fertilizers and pesticides which may pollute surface waters by runoff&#13;
from soils and contaminate groundwater and aquifer bodies due to the downward&#13;
percolation of polluted soil water.&#13;
7.        Bangladesh has a comparatively low rate of fertilizer and pesticide&#13;
consumption compared to neighboring countries. Currently the rate of&#13;
agrochemical use in the coastal area is low. In other areas, where irrigated&#13;
agriculture has been introduced, the consumption of fertilizers and pesticides&#13;
has increased two to three fold. Much of this increased consumption is the&#13;
result of boro cultivation with HYV rice which has a greater demand for&#13;
nutrients than low yielding varieties and is also more prone to pests.&#13;
S.        It is unlikely that agrochemical consumption will increase&#13;
dramatically in coastal polders or that environmental problems will arise for&#13;
the following reasons:&#13;
Due to lack of irrigation water it is not expected that triple&#13;
cropping or the adoption of high yield boro varieties will be&#13;
widespread. Switching to HYV varieties would be confined in&#13;
most areas to the aman season. Therefore, one would not&#13;
expect the agrochemical consumption rate to increase as much&#13;
as two fold.&#13;
The build-up of unacceptable levels of agrochemicals within&#13;
polders is unlikely to occur due to the flushing effects of&#13;
seasonal flooding and drainage of polders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 189 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 5 of 14&#13;
Many of the coastal aquifers are small and isolated and&#13;
'protected' by the impermeability of the confining layers;&#13;
widespread contamination by pesticides is therefore difficult&#13;
to envisage.&#13;
Supplementary Irrigation using Surface Water Resources&#13;
9.        In many polder areas intensification of agricultural production&#13;
leads to drawing down of surface water in ponds and khals, reducing water&#13;
availability for domestic use, for bathing and laundry, for livestock watering&#13;
and for fishing. While in the proposed project area there is some potential&#13;
for this occurring, it should be remembered that the project would increase&#13;
availability of fresh surface water, since in the absence of the project these&#13;
water bodies would become saline. Over the longer run encouragement of crops&#13;
requiring less water than rice will reduce this problem.&#13;
Salinization of groundwater&#13;
10.       While over-pumping leading to salinization of groundwater would&#13;
have significant detrimental effects, it is unlikely to occur. Since any&#13;
over-pumping would cause salinization of farmers' own sources of drinking&#13;
water, they can be relied upon to use appropriate restraint, as they have in&#13;
the past.&#13;
Soil Waterlogging&#13;
11.       One of the adverse impacts reported of the previous coastal&#13;
embankment project was that waterlogging of soils occurred in some areas as a&#13;
result of inadequate polder drainage. In general, this appears to have been&#13;
addressed by polder drainage improvement schemes. The rehabilitation of&#13;
embankments will result in their height being increased which could exacerbate&#13;
or create such problems. However, since the environmental consultants are not&#13;
aware of any significant waterlogging problems at present which are&#13;
attributable to coastal embankments per se, it is not considered that this&#13;
impact has a high probability of occurrence or significance. Further, the&#13;
project will finance additional drainage improvements in selected polders&#13;
which will help to prevent this impact from occurring.&#13;
Abandonment of Local Seed Varieties&#13;
12.       As the residual salinity of the soil declines due to the flushing&#13;
effects of yearly flooding and drainage, farmers are expected to replace local&#13;
salt tolerant varieties with HYV strains. While the impact at the farm level&#13;
is expected to be a positive, measures are required to conserve the country's&#13;
genetic resources. This is being undertaken under an ongoing IDA financed&#13;
project (as described in para 31).&#13;
13.       An additional impact related to the adoption of HYV rice is the&#13;
potential reduction in fodder availability. This arises because the residual&#13;
straw after rice harvesting is much less with HYV rice than with local&#13;
varieties. Whilst this impact may be of local significance, we do not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 190 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 6 of 14&#13;
anticipate that it will be of significance throughout most of the project&#13;
area. Where it is an issue, farmers can be encouraged to grow sufficient&#13;
fodder crops to provide for livestock needs.&#13;
Costs and Benefits&#13;
14.       The overall impact of agricultural intensification can be&#13;
determined by comparing the positive and negative impacts associated with&#13;
intensification which are described above. The key negative impacts which&#13;
have to be weighed against agricultural intensification are the loss of&#13;
genetic diversity and the possibilities of pollution due to increased use of&#13;
agrochemicals or depletion of surface water resources as a result of increased&#13;
profitability of irrigation. It is difficult to compare these impacts on a&#13;
quantitative basis with the benefits of increased crop yields. A more central&#13;
issue to the cost-benefit analysis however, is the scope and cost for impact&#13;
mitigation and the significance of any residual impacts. It is possible to&#13;
collect and preserve for future use indigenous seed (a component of the World&#13;
Bank/ODA Agriculture Support Services Project addresses this issue). It is&#13;
also possible to encourage farmers to plant crops of lower water demand and to&#13;
train farmers to use appropriate levels of agricultural inputs and integrated&#13;
pest management methods.&#13;
Fisheries&#13;
15.       The construction of coastal embankments affects the fisheries&#13;
sector in two ways. Open water capture fisheries are most likely to be&#13;
adversely affected due to the barrier effect of the embankments. In contrast,&#13;
embankment construction and the protection it affords will create a relatively&#13;
risk-free environment for investments in intensive aquaculture to take place.&#13;
Open Water Capture Fisheries&#13;
16.       Generally inland fisheries have been in decline for some time.  The&#13;
reason for this is not clear-cut and is likely to involve a combination of&#13;
factors in different areas, including overfishing and the development of flood&#13;
control, drainage and irrigation systems. However, open fresh water fisheries&#13;
are not of great biological or economic significance in the coastal polders&#13;
where marine subsistence and economic fishing predominate. Moreover, the&#13;
project embankments do not close up major or medium rivers or shoot channels&#13;
of these rivers which are the main routes for migration of fish to the&#13;
spawning grounds in flood plains. Therefore, it is unlikely that the CERP&#13;
will have any significant discernable impacts on the open water capture&#13;
fishery which are additional to existing pressures on the fishery.&#13;
Aquaculture&#13;
17.       Aquaculture production in the coastal areas of Bangladesh is well&#13;
below potential rates of production. With a greater degree of protection,&#13;
investments in both brackish and freshwater aquaculture could yield&#13;
significant increases in fish and shrimp production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 10&#13;
Page 7 of 14&#13;
Freshwater Aquaculture&#13;
18.       Estimates have been made of the area of cultivable and derelict&#13;
ponds which could be rehabilitated, and of the approximate production of&#13;
existing cultured ponds. Increased production benefits in existing cultured&#13;
ponds will accrue to the owner or leaser rather than to the population in&#13;
general. There may be some limited additional employment opportunities for&#13;
the underemployed, however. There is considerable potential for involving the&#13;
rural poor in reclaiming derelict ponds for freshwater fish and shrimp culture&#13;
with the assistance of NGOs. This could have significant positive impacts on&#13;
the nutritional and economic status of people involved, bringing project&#13;
benefits to a wider section of the rural community.&#13;
Brackish Water Aquaculture&#13;
19.       It is highly probable that the project will result in an increase&#13;
in the production of existing brackish water shrimp and fish farms, and also&#13;
an increase in the area under aquaculture activities. The net result will be&#13;
increased income to farm owners, increased employment opportunities and&#13;
stimulation of support activities such as product processing and packaging,&#13;
refrigeration services and transport.&#13;
20.       In most of the project area shrimp is grown in alternation with&#13;
salt production in areas unsuitable for rice. However, there is currently&#13;
some conflict of interest with rice farmers in areas where both activities co-&#13;
exist. It has been reported in some areas that shrimp farmers are forcing&#13;
rice farmers to yield their land for expansion. Even in areas where this does&#13;
not occur, salinisation of agricultural land adjacent to aquaculture farms is&#13;
an interference factor. This issue predates the proposed project and is&#13;
unlikely to be significantly worsened by the project.&#13;
Costs and Benefits&#13;
21.       While the damage to open water fisheries of flood control and&#13;
drainage projects can be compensated in production terms by increases in&#13;
aquaculture, it can generally be argued that the beneficiaries of increased&#13;
aquaculture production are mainly richer elements of the rural communities&#13;
while the loss of open water fisheries is mainly bourn by the poor. However,&#13;
in the project area open water fisheries are not significant and the project&#13;
does not adversely affect open water fisheries in other areas. Therefore,&#13;
these general arguments do not apply in this case. While the main&#13;
beneficiaries of expansion of acquacultural activities will still be the&#13;
richer elements of the community, there will be increased employment&#13;
opportunities without damage to the access of the poor to open water&#13;
fisheries.&#13;
Socio-Economic Impact&#13;
22.       The CERP gives rise to several socio-economic impacts and issues&#13;
which are related to the construction of embankments, agricultural and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

aquacultural intensification and to the afforestation component of the&#13;
project.&#13;
resettlement and compensation;&#13;
improved economic status of the landless; and&#13;
changes in the social fabric of rural communities.&#13;
Resettlement and Compensation&#13;
23.       The rehabilitation of embankments will require additional land on&#13;
both the seaward and landward sides of the embankments. Some additional land&#13;
may also be required for mangrove afforestation. This will affect existing&#13;
land owners within the polders in the following ways:&#13;
*     Some homesteads which lie close to the existing embankments&#13;
will have to be relocated.&#13;
Homestead gardens, fruit trees and ponds may be lost due to&#13;
land take.&#13;
Agricultural land may be lost, affecting the families ability&#13;
to sustain itself.&#13;
Squatter families on embankments which require rehabilitation&#13;
will have to be relocated.&#13;
A detailed polder-wise survey of affected assets along the proposed embankment&#13;
alignment and a resettlement and compensation plan are currently being&#13;
undertaken to ensure that no persons are significantly adversely affected by&#13;
the project. Provided the issue of compensation and resettlement is managed&#13;
efficiently and effectively, only short term inconvenience, which could be&#13;
deemed insignificant, may be experienced.&#13;
Economic Status of the Landless&#13;
24.       Some of the landless people currently living on the existing&#13;
embankments or on char lands will receive the opportunity to lease embankment&#13;
land which can be cultivated in suitable tree crops for the long term&#13;
livelihood of the landless family. Landless Contracting Societies will also&#13;
have the opportunity to undertake long term maintenance work for which they&#13;
will receive payment. This income will substantially improve their economic&#13;
status. The net result of successful afforestation and embankment leasing&#13;
will have long-term significant positive impacts on the landless community.&#13;
Social Fabric of Rural Communities&#13;
25.       There is the potential for social conflicts to arise between the&#13;
land owners who are affected by land take, and the newly settled landless who&#13;
may occupy the area of the formers land. In addition, the social fabric of&#13;
existing rural settlements may be disrupted by the resettlement of land owners&#13;
elsewhere. Overall such impacts may not be significantly adverse. However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 193 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 9 of 14&#13;
at the local level serious conflict could arise. This can largely be&#13;
prevented by careful consideration during the planning stage and the&#13;
involvement of beneficiaries.&#13;
Costs and Benefits&#13;
26.       At the gross project level, it is apparent that project benefits&#13;
far outweigh the costs; one has to compare the loss of about 600 ha of land&#13;
due to land take (requiring compensation payments to up to 6000 families or&#13;
60,000 people most of whom would lose only a small portion of their holdings)&#13;
with the protection afforded to 1.2 million people. About 140,000 people were&#13;
killed during the 1991 cyclone.&#13;
27.       At the polder level, the positive impacts which arise from the CERP&#13;
are of high significance for the landless and land owning groups of the&#13;
project area. The enhanced opportunities for long and short term employment&#13;
for landless and marginal farmers and the reduced potential for loss of life&#13;
greatly outweigh, in opinion of the environmental consultants, the potential&#13;
negative impacts of disruption to rural communities and hardship for land&#13;
owners due to land take; there is considerable scope to prevent or mitigate&#13;
these negative impacts.&#13;
Hvdroloc*v and Sediment Dynamics&#13;
28.       The construction of embankments alters the natural pattern of river&#13;
flow and of seasonal flooding in the project area. However, the environmental&#13;
consultants conclude that no significant adverse impacts will arise since&#13;
there is ample scope to prevent or mitigate them.&#13;
Afforestation&#13;
29.       The provision of afforestation on the foreshore areas and on the&#13;
embankments for protection of the embankments against wave action and erosion&#13;
by rainwater and wind will have the following beneficial impacts upon the&#13;
environment:&#13;
Provide protection of the embankments and foreshore area&#13;
against erosion by waves;&#13;
Reduce the wind velocity of cyclones and strong monsoon winds&#13;
and thereby reduce wind generated damages and soil erosion;&#13;
Protect the pollen of the paddy from strong monsoon wind,&#13;
resulting in increase of crop yields;&#13;
Increase the vegetation coverage of the area which will&#13;
facilitate restoration of the ecological imbalances and&#13;
erratic behavior of the nature;&#13;
Help meet the demand of fuel energy in the project area; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 10&#13;
Page 10 of 14&#13;
Provide valuable food, and cash income to the local farmers,&#13;
resulting in uplift of the rural economy.&#13;
This component would also provide a long-term means of livelihood to a&#13;
significant number of landless families.&#13;
C. Environmental Management Plan for the Project Area&#13;
30.       Tables 1 and 2 summarize options for environmental monitoring and&#13;
mitigation of project impacts. These options constitute an environmental&#13;
management plan for the CERP and address the following requirements.&#13;
*    Monitoring of environmental impacts in a cost effective way&#13;
and where possible combining the project monitoring&#13;
requirements with those of related projects.&#13;
Enhancement of the positive impacts of the project by&#13;
providing assistance to beneficiaries in achieving sustainable&#13;
development of polder resources through technical assistance&#13;
and the development of self-help groups.&#13;
Prevention and/or mitigation of negative impacts through&#13;
improved polder management involving beneficiaries,&#13;
agricultural extension activities and NGO guidance and&#13;
assistance to beneficiaries.&#13;
Management of Agricultural Intensification&#13;
31.       The potential for negative environmental impacts of agricultural&#13;
intensification to arise are directly related to the nature of cultivation&#13;
practices in the project area. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE)&#13;
and selected NGOs will, through extension activities, promote sustainable&#13;
agricultural development. In particular, the IDA supported Agricultural&#13;
Support Services Project (ASSP) will support:&#13;
Integrated pest management.&#13;
Appropriate application and handling of agrochemicals.&#13;
Crop diversification (also involving lower water demand&#13;
crops).&#13;
Development of horticultural export businesses.&#13;
Appropriate irrigation water management.&#13;
In addition the ASSP will also support the development and cultivation of more&#13;
appropriate seed varieties and the establishment of genetic seed banks.&#13;

Page 13 of 14&#13;
32.       Appropriate NGOs, who will be involved in other components of the&#13;
project will be invited to collaborate in efforts to increase agricultural&#13;
production and promote appropriate use of farm inputs. They will also play a&#13;
role in assisting the landless in afforestation activities on the embankments&#13;
and in foreshore areas. The DAE and the FD would provide technical support to&#13;
the NGOs in these activities.&#13;
Coordinating Development Efforts&#13;
33.       To stimulate and coordinate the above activities an Agricultural&#13;
Development Officer will be appointed to the Project Implementation Unit for a&#13;
10 month period spread over 18 months and starting in the second year of the&#13;
project. The main duties of this officer would be to ensure that the&#13;
necessary actions take place to promote agricultural intensification in the&#13;
project area, many of which will be promoted nationally under the ASSP and&#13;
NMIDP. He will collaborate with the ASSP and NMIDP PIU consultants, the CERP&#13;
Social Development Officer, the CERP Environmental Specialist and other CERP&#13;
TA specialists in ensuring that a holistic approach to the management of&#13;
agricultural and environmental impacts is adopted.&#13;
Management of Fisheries Issues&#13;
34.       While the project will not obstruct any major natural water courses&#13;
affecting fish migration, it could affect some small seasonal water bodies.&#13;
In such areas, drainage structures would be operated so as to facilitate&#13;
fisheries. The program for appropriate regulator operation would be developed&#13;
by the environmental specialist in consultation with local groups and DoF&#13;
staff at the upazila level. Shrimp inlets would be provided where needed to&#13;
avoid damage to shrimp production.&#13;
35.       Various on-going projects are involved in programs to promote fresh&#13;
and brackish water fisheries production, particularly through the leasing of&#13;
ponds, fish farm management and husbandry. The current project would increase&#13;
the opportunities for such activities.&#13;
Impact Monitoring&#13;
36.       As noted in Table 2, much of the monitoring of the impact of the&#13;
project can be achieved without additional work by drawing upon information&#13;
already being collected by other agencies and donor-supported monitoring&#13;
programs. The project implementation consultants terms of reference would&#13;
include responsibility for developing appropriate monitoring programs,&#13;
ensuring that working mechanisms are in place to obtain required data already&#13;
being collected and supplementing this data as necessary. The technical&#13;
assistance component of the proposed project includes funds for procurement of&#13;
such supplementary equipment as many be appropriate, such as portable soil and&#13;
water analysis kits. Data collected should be on a polder basis, to the&#13;
extent possible, to allow information generated to be used for management&#13;
decisions at the polder level.&#13;
&#13;

Polder Operation and Maintenance&#13;
37.       The operation and management of polders will ultimately rest with&#13;
the BWDB through its local offices. The BWDB will develop O&amp;M schedules which&#13;
take into account the agricultural and fisheries requirements of polder&#13;
occupants. DAB and DoF would provide information on such requirements. The&#13;
implementation consultants would assist in developing mechanisms at the local&#13;
level to ensure that all concerned agencies are consulted.&#13;
Developing BWDB's Environmental Management Capabilities&#13;
38.       The BWDB is concerned with the development and management of a wide&#13;
range of flood control, drainage and irrigation measures throughout&#13;
Bangladesh. It is appropriate that an agency whose actions have far reaching&#13;
consequences for the human and natural environment should incorporate&#13;
environmental considerations into its activities. GOB is committed to&#13;
developing environmental cells within all key Government agencies and&#13;
Ministries. This approach is currently being defined within the GOB National&#13;
Environmental Management Action Plan.&#13;
39.       While this overall approach is being worked out, the current&#13;
project will support short term in-country training on environmental and&#13;
social issues for key technical, operational and management staff involved in&#13;
the operation and maintenance of flood control, drainage, and irrigation&#13;
structures and systems. This will help to develop social and environmental&#13;
awareness within BWDB and encourage incorporation of environmental&#13;
considerations in the planning and design of such projects.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
40.       The project implementation technical assistance program will&#13;
include inter alia finance of short term inputs of the following international&#13;
consultants over the life of the project.&#13;

COASTAL EMBANKMENT REHABILITATION PROJECT (CERP)&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
1.    Economic analysis was done separately for 11 of 12 polders with major&#13;
works financed under this project.1 Economic analysis was not done for those&#13;
polders where the major works were financed under the PWP, and where the&#13;
current project only includes complementary measures (minor works,&#13;
afforestation and improved operation and maintenance (O&amp;M)) because the&#13;
return to such complementary works, treating the PWP investments as sunk&#13;
costs, is known to be high. The main assumptions of the economic analysis&#13;
follow.&#13;
2.    Prices.  All costs and benefits are expressed in constant 1994 prices.&#13;
Recent Bank commodity price projections were used to derive world prices of&#13;
traded goods. Economic farmgate prices were then calculated from the projected&#13;
world prices for 2000/2005, with appropriate adjustments for quality, freight,&#13;
insurance, handling, processing, and inland transport, as illustrated in Table&#13;
1. Import parity values are used for goods that are imported in normal years,&#13;
such as wheat; export parity values are used for goods that Bangladesh&#13;
normally exports, such as jute and urea. For non-traded goods and services,&#13;
financial prices were converted to economic prices using a standard conversion&#13;
factor (SCF) of 0.90. The official exchange rate of US$1 to Taka 40.25&#13;
(currently used for all projects in Bangladesh) converts prices in US dollars&#13;
to Taka. Table 2 summarizes the financial and economic prices of the principal&#13;
goods.&#13;
Costs&#13;
3.    Investment Costs.  These include the cost of major and minor civil&#13;
works: resectioning and/or retirement of embankments, replacement or repair of&#13;
existing drainage structures, new drainage structures, new protection works,&#13;
repairs to existing revetment works, surveys and investigations, khal re-&#13;
excavation, and establishment costs, land acquisition, afforestation, and&#13;
resettlement. All costs associated with these activities, minus price&#13;
contingencies, taxes and duties, have been included. Sections of the&#13;
embankments in polders 59/2 (Ramgati) and 72 (Sandwip) would have to be&#13;
retired again in about year 15 of the operation due to erosion, and the costs&#13;
1.    For Polder 60 (Sonagazi), the project does not include major civil works&#13;
and only 2 km of embankment strengthening plus khal excavation, and this&#13;
polder is therefore excluded from the economic analysis. More time is&#13;
required to test the effectiveness of recently completed anti-erosion&#13;
works before firm estimates can be justified. Anowar (where about US$2&#13;
million equivalent of expenditure is planned to complete major works&#13;
started under PWP) is also excluded from the analysis.&#13;
&#13;

- 200 -                           ANNEX 11&#13;

of retirement have accordingly been included. The salvage values of project&#13;
facilities have not been subtracted from the costs because their discounted&#13;
value would be very small.&#13;
4.    Operation and Maintenance Costs.  Incremental costs for O&amp;M have been&#13;
estimated for each polder with respect to protective works and routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance, operation of structures, repair of cyclone damage, and&#13;
maintenance of afforestation on embankment and the foreshore. The cost of&#13;
family labor used in routine maintenance of the embankment and afforestation&#13;
is assumed to be equal to the opportunity cost of labor; the latter is&#13;
approximated by what laborers earn as casual workers or sharecroppers (about&#13;
Taka 9,000 per family per year). Taxes and duties are excluded.&#13;
5.    Value of Unskilled Labor.  There are significant seasonal variations in&#13;
agricultural wages in the project area and, because of widespread&#13;
unemployment, market wages overstate the opportunity cost of labor. A weighted&#13;
average wage rate for each polder was therefore applied to eliminate seasonal&#13;
variations in farm wages. The average wage was then multiplied by 0.75 to&#13;
reflect the true opportunity cost of labor.&#13;
Benefits&#13;
6.    The main benefits are reduction in loss of life and property during&#13;
major cyclones, and prevention of salinity intrusions and storm surges during&#13;
normal monsoons, allowing increased agricultural production. Production&#13;
during normal monsoons would increase over the without project situation due&#13;
to (i) the direct effects on yields due to reduced saline intrusions; (ii) the&#13;
introduction of higher yielding crops made possible by the decrease in&#13;
salinity and the reduced threat of periodic cyclone damage; and (iii) better&#13;
drainage. In addition to these normal year benefits, there would be reduced&#13;
agricultural losses in years of severe cyclones. Indirect benefits from&#13;
growth linkages and environmental goods are excluded for lack of data.&#13;
7.    Savincr of Human Life.  No attempt has been made to quantify benefits&#13;
from lives saved, but this is clearly a major benefit of the operation.&#13;
B.    Agricultural Benefits.  Agricultural benefits include crop, livestock&#13;
and fisheries production.&#13;
(a)   Crops. The components of incremental crop output during normal&#13;
years are higher yields, more valuable cropping patterns and&#13;
higher cropping intensity. The with and without project&#13;
situations are estimated in Annex B. In estimating the reduction&#13;
of damages during severe cyclones, it is assumed that high water&#13;
levels corresponding to cyclones of a severity that occurs with a&#13;
frequency of once in 40 years result in severe flooding both in&#13;
the "without project" and "with project" situations. Hardly any&#13;
standing crop would be saved. Estimation of benefits from&#13;
protection to standing crops has therefore been based upon&#13;
detailed analysis of damage from cyclone surges with 10 and 20&#13;
year return periods. Experience shows that about 50% and 40W of&#13;
the crops would be saved by the embankments in the case of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 201 -                          ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
cyclonic surges with a return period of 10 and 20 years,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
(b)   Livestock. Based on the official estimate of 40% of livestock lost&#13;
in Sandwip (Polder 72) during the 1991 cyclone, a livestock loss&#13;
of 309 in the "Without Project" situation has been assumed in the&#13;
analysis for cyclones with a return period of 10 years or more.&#13;
(c)   Fisheries. Shrimp farming is an important activity in parts of the&#13;
project zone. Improved embankments and sluices would protect fish&#13;
ponds and shrimp farms, especially for cyclones with a return&#13;
period of less than 40 years. The expected loss in income from&#13;
such fisheries without the protection afforded by the project has&#13;
been based on official estimates.&#13;
9.    Salt Production.  Salt production is vulnerable to saline intrusion at&#13;
the end of the production period in April. Cyclone seasons are October-&#13;
November and April-May, implying a 25% probability of an April cyclone. The&#13;
probability of cyclone damage to salt production has accordingly been adjusted&#13;
by a factor of 0.25 when estimating losses.&#13;
10.   Protection of Property and Infrastructure.  The embankments would&#13;
protect houses and other buildings, roads, culverts and other structures. The&#13;
damage during cyclones of a return period of 10 years or more was estimated&#13;
based on data on damage during recent cyclones. About 864,000 houses were&#13;
completely destroyed and another 774,000 were partially damaged during the&#13;
1991 cyclone.  A value of Taka 15,000 has been assigned to each destroyed&#13;
house.  This low value is due to the fact that cyclones destroy mainly the&#13;
poorest houses. The average damage to roads and culverts, based on field&#13;
observations, is assumed to be 5% and 30%, respectively, of the replacement&#13;
value.  Based on a sample of four polders where road categories and number of&#13;
culverts have been registered and valued, the average losses have been&#13;
estimated at Tk 2,000 per ha. It has also been assumed that regulators and&#13;
other infrastructure in shrimp farms would be saved particularly with regard&#13;
to cyclones with return periods of 10 and 20 years.&#13;
11.   Destruction by high winds has been excluded because the embankments do&#13;
not protect against wind. Half of the damage to buildings has been attributed&#13;
to wind, as have all losses of telephone lines and power supplies.&#13;
12.   Afforestation Benefits.  Afforestation of the embankments and a 50 to&#13;
200 meter wide belt on the foreshore would reduce cyclone damage and&#13;
embankment maintenance costs. This benefit has been taken into account when&#13;
estimating the costs of periodic and routine maintenance of the embankment and&#13;
cyclone damage repairs.   In addition to protecting the embankments, resulting&#13;
in lower operations and maintenance costs, other direct economic benefits of&#13;
afforestation include timber, fuel wood, fruits, and fodder. On the negative&#13;
side, the foreshore afforestation would lead to loss of some agricultural land&#13;
leading to reduced agricultural production. This loss has been assumed to be&#13;
equal to the value added of T. Aman under saline conditions. (On only about&#13;
1,000 ha out of the 4,700 ha planned for foreshore afforestation are crops&#13;
currently growtn.) Indirect environmental benefits have not been included for&#13;
lack of data.&#13;

Proiect Execution&#13;
13.   Investment phasing will vary from polder to polder, depending on the&#13;
condition of the embankment and the earthworks involved. The earthworks for&#13;
the major embankment repairs are assumed to be completed within three years&#13;
while the minor works component (other than khal re-excavation) would be&#13;
completed in four years. Afforestation on the foreshore would start at the&#13;
end of year one. Afforestation of the embankments would begin generally in&#13;
year three, while starting in year two in a few polders. Project&#13;
implementation has been assumed to produce full benefits beginning in the&#13;
seventh year.&#13;
14.   Summary of Results. Table 3 summarizes the aggregate results and&#13;
information for individual polders is in Tables 4 to 14. The overall economic&#13;
rate of return (ERR) based upon quantifyable benefits for the 11 polders in&#13;
the project including major works, but excluding any value for reduced loss of&#13;
human life, is estimated at 19.2%. The net present value of the incremental&#13;
benefits is estimated at US$27.0 million. Polderwise ERRs range from 6.6%&#13;
(Polder 70, Matherbari) to 28.1% (Polder 35/1, Sharankhola and Polder 59/3B&#13;
Sudharam). All polders have ERRs greater than 12%, excepting Polders 48,&#13;
59/2, and 70 which have ERRs of about 7.9%, 6.9%, and 6.6%, respectively.&#13;
Taking account of the additional benefit of saving human lives, these polders&#13;
are considered justified for inclusion in the project. For example, during&#13;
the 1991 cyclone about 10,000 people were killed in polder 70 from a&#13;
population of 23,000.&#13;
15.   Risks and Sensitivity Analysis.  The economic analysis was supplemented&#13;
by a sensitivity analysis to include higher investment and O&amp;M costs and lower&#13;
quantifiable benefits (agricultural, non-agricultural, and afforestation).&#13;
(a)   The effect of an increase in investment cost was tested because&#13;
there is a risk of implementation delays due to&#13;
management/institutional weaknesses and to inadequate Government&#13;
funding resulting in cost escalation.&#13;
(b)   O&amp;M costs may also increase.  The proposed community participation&#13;
in routine embankment maintenance and afforestation has not been&#13;
tried in the proposed form. If the proposed afforestation&#13;
component fails, the cost of routine maintenance would increase&#13;
substantially.&#13;
(c)   The impact of a reduction in agricultural benefits was tested&#13;
because this is the most important variable among the quantifiable&#13;
benefits. Agricultural benefits would fall due to intrusion of&#13;
saline water. A major risk of the project is that the life of the&#13;
embankments may be reduced if inadequate funds are provided for&#13;
O&amp;M. In this case, non-agricultural benefits (protection of&#13;
property and infrastructure), which are important in some polders,&#13;
would also be affected adversely. In the event that the life of&#13;
the embankments is reduced, available engineering data suggest&#13;
that it would be necessary to have major expenditure on embankment&#13;
rehabilitation in about year 10 and again in year 27 after project&#13;
completion. It has been assumed in the analysis that for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 203 -                            ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
southern polders, which are very prone to cyclone damage, and&#13;
polders in the south west about 75% and 50%, respectively, of the&#13;
present cost of rehabilitation would be required in the tenth and&#13;
twenty seventh year after project completion.&#13;
(d)   The impact of a reduction in afforestation benefits was tested&#13;
because there is a major risk in the community participation&#13;
component for afforestation and routine embankment maintenance.&#13;
16.   Tables 4 to 14 present the sensitivity analysis. Exceptionally large&#13;
adverse changes in the variables tested would have to take place before the&#13;
ERR for any of the polders, except Polders 48, 59/2, and 70, drops to 12%.&#13;
Excluding Polders 48, 59/2 and 70, investment and O&amp;M costs would have to&#13;
increase by between 47% (Polder 73/1A&amp;B, Hatiya) and 174% (Polder 59/3B,&#13;
Sudharam) to bring ERR to 12%. Total project benefits would have to fall by&#13;
between 32% (Polder 73/1A&amp;B) and 64% (Polder 59/3B) to reduce ERR to 12%; in&#13;
the case of agricultural benefits the required fall would range from 44%&#13;
(Polder 73/1A&amp;B, Hatiya) to 82% (Polder 72); for afforestation benefits the&#13;
necessary fall would range from 202% (Polder 73/A&amp;B) to 931% (Polder 35/1);&#13;
and for a reduction in non-agricultural benefits the range would be from 390%&#13;
(Polders 40/2, Patherghata and 59/3C, Companiganj) to 978% (Polder 35/1).&#13;
The ERR is highly insensitive to changes in non-agricultural benefits because&#13;
the value of non-agricultural benefits is relatively small in most of the&#13;
polders. Major expenditure on embankment rehabilitation in year 10 and 27&#13;
after project completion (a proxy for cost effects of inadequate maintenance)&#13;
would reduce the average ERR from 18.2* to 17.1%.&#13;
17.   The table below gives the ERR for various combinations of unfavorable&#13;
developments. It shows that to bring the ERR on quantifiable benefits below&#13;
12% would require a combination of a two year delay in project completion and&#13;
a decrease in project benefits exceeding 30%, or a three year delay in project&#13;
completion and a decrease in project benefits of about 20%. Other&#13;
combinations which would reduce the ERR to 12% woud include a two year delay&#13;
in project completion and an increase in O&amp;M costs of over 30%, or a three&#13;
year delay and an increase in O&amp;M costs of about 15%. Such combinations of&#13;
unfavorable developments are considered unlikely. Even then, the additional&#13;
nonquantifyable benefits of saving human lives would still make the project&#13;
worth doing.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Coastal Embankment
            Rehabilitation &amp; Reconstruction Project are: 1) cyclone
            protection; 2) improved agricultural production; and 3)
            introduction of improved technology and improved methods of
            embankment maintenance. The project includes the following
            components: 1) rehabilitation and improvements to 12
            sea-facing embankments; 2) minor rehabilitation and
            improvements to the non-coastal sections of the polders in
            the Mid-Term Program; 3) afforestation of embankment slopes
            and a strip of 50 to 200 meters of foreshore to reduce
            cyclone damage and embankment maintenance costs; 4) improved
            operation-maintenance of all polders in the Mid-Term
            Program; 5) a program of compensation, rehabilitation and
            resettlement of people displaced by the project; 6)
            environmental monitoring and provision for appropriate
            mitigating measures; 7) studies to investigate the
            possibility of cost-effective town protection works for
            Sandwip; 8) technical assistance for implementation support
            for components 1) through 7) above, and for coordination
            between the project and other projects concerning
            agricultural production and NGO activities; 9) training of
            staff of implementing agencies and participating NGOs, and
            for community participants; and 10) vehicles and minor
            equipment required for GOB supervision of project
            implementation, and for afforestation.
