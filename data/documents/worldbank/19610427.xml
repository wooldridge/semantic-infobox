Report of the Committee under Section 4 (iii) of Article III of the Articles of Agreement&#13;
on the proposed Loan (First Development Policy Loan) to Ukraine&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) hereby&#13;
submits its report pursuant to Section 4 (iii) of Article III of said Articles in respect of the&#13;
proposal that the Bank grant to Ukraine (the Borrower) a loan in an amount of seven hundred&#13;
fifty million United States Dollars ($750,000,000). The purposes of said loan are to: (i) promote&#13;
good governance, transparency, and accountability in the public sector; (ii) strengthen the&#13;
regulatory framework and reduce costs of doing business; and (iii) reform inefficient and&#13;
inequitable utility subsidies while protecting the poor.&#13;
1.    The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a loan, and&#13;
of the purposes to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the program in support of which the proceeds of&#13;
such loan are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in Article I of said&#13;
Articles of Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the development of the&#13;
productive facilities and resources of Ukraine and is in the interest of Ukraine and of the&#13;
members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;

Bank, and hereby recommends said program for such assistance.&#13;
