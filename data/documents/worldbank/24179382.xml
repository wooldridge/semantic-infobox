&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#152;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh&#13;
Kapur, The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings&#13;
Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic&#13;
overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the&#13;
planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at other times they&#13;
talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes&#13;
and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group&#13;
Archives believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it&#13;
available for public use.&#13;

Note: This transcript was made by the Bookings Institutionâ&#128;&#152;s World Bank history&#13;
project. The copy of tape1 of session 1 that was transferred to the World Bank Group&#13;
Archives has no sound on it; therefore, Archivesâ&#128;&#152; auditing of the interview began with&#13;
tape 2 of session 1. Also, information is incorporated in the text of the transcript of&#13;
session 2 that is not part of the spoken word; presumably these additions were made at&#13;
the request of William Diamond or by the Brookings team based on unrecorded&#13;
conversations with William Diamond or written material from him. The Brookings&#13;
transcriber enclosed some additions in [ ]. Archivesâ&#128;&#152; editorial insertions are in&#13;

                                    Session 1&#13;
                                 October 23, 1991&#13;
                                 Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: . . . and agriculture didn't become a priority also until the middle '60s&#13;
after George Woods came, as John [Lewis] rightly mentioned at lunch last week.&#13;
Then agriculture suddenly began to loom more. So I have no doubt that that's part of&#13;
it, the Bank's interest.&#13;
&#13;
There are two other things, I think, that are relevant. First of all, it's the history.&#13;
How did we get into this development bank field to start with? There was that three-&#13;
man mission to India, and we wrote an economic report, the three of us, and we wrote&#13;
a strategy for--did I say India? Turkey! We wrote a strategy report and we identified&#13;
projects, and the projects we identified were the usual big things, the Seyhan Dam,&#13;
agricultural silos, grain storage projects, the rehabilitation of the ports. And during&#13;
that mission one of the things that happened was, since there was lots in the&#13;
newspapers about it, was the first World Bank mission to Turkey. But during that&#13;
mission we kept getting telephone calls from industrialists and business people&#13;
saying, "We want a loan for industry." And we kept saying, "Can you get a&#13;
government guarantee?" "What! A government guarantee!" Bang! And it became&#13;
clear that there was a lot of desire for it, and if we could lend, if the World Bank&#13;
could provide capital for this, we couldn't handle it from Washington in a World Bank&#13;
loan. Mind you, agriculture then to some extent was being taken care of. There was&#13;
the Ziraat Bankasi, the big agricultural bank--which I notice in the current issue of&#13;
The Economist has an ad saying it's the largest bank in Turkey, which surprises me. I&#13;
thought the Isbank was. The Ziraat Bankasi and the U.S. government was providing a&#13;
great deal of assistance in the agricultural sector. What struck us was the need for&#13;
industry. When we invented the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey, our first&#13;
name for it was the Industrial Development Institute. This was our code name in&#13;
memoranda back in--did I say that there?--an industrial institute. So there's the history&#13;
of how we got into it.&#13;
&#13;
And then, finally, maybe the most important of these factors is bureaucracy. We&#13;
developed a bureaucracy. We didn't have a bureaucracy in a development banks&#13;
department; we had staff and offices. But it was a big agricultural department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  William Diamond&#13;
                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Incidentally, I recently had occasion to count up. At the time my department was&#13;
abolished in the [Robert S.] McNamara reorganization we had 90 people in it dealing&#13;
with development banks alone. This includes secretaries, by the way, but my guess is&#13;
it would have been about two-third of that who were professionals--which was&#13;
reasonably big for those days.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Almost about a tenth.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No, it must have been more than that by 1972, I'm speaking of.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: A tenth of IFC [International Finance Corporation] , you mean?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No, this was the World Bank. It had already moved by that time. It&#13;
was much smaller. [both speaking at once] There was much more than--yes, 1972?&#13;
Well, you can easily find that out.&#13;
&#13;
So agriculture had become very big, and agriculture had become a priority in the&#13;
World Bank also, and they wanted to do things in their way. These were primarily&#13;
agricultural economistsâ&#128;&#148;these were not the financial people--agricultural economists&#13;
and agronomists. In about 1970, mÃ s o menos, I wrote a memorandum to McNamara&#13;
back in the Bank--and I was meeting with him weekly unless he or I called it off--&#13;
saying--I'm sure I have that memo at home someplace--saying that it seemed to me&#13;
wrong for the people dealing with agricultural credits to be pursuing one kind of&#13;
policy with respect to providing credit while those dealing with things called&#13;
development banks which were primarily industrial and to some extent tourism--and&#13;
there were a few such companies that were truly multi-purpose; you'll find this says&#13;
multi-purpose ones are okay, too, but there weren't many like that--for us to be&#13;
pursuing a different line. And I said, "Never mind for the moment who's right. The&#13;
point is we should know more of what's going on," and McNamara then issued an&#13;
edict saying that all proposals and appraisals for agricultural credit projects must be&#13;
sent to [my department] for review. This was 1970; it could have been 1971. It was&#13;
in the last year or two before the reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
I remember the guy who was then the head of agriculture in the Bank was very upset&#13;
about it. I guess I was supposed to send it to him too, but I don't remember that part.&#13;
It wouldn't have bothered me at all. He was very upset because he said, "What do you&#13;
know about agriculture?" Well, I'll admit there wasn't much, but that wasn't the point.&#13;
Finance was the point, not agriculture. What concrete results it had I don't know, but&#13;
that would be an interesting memorandum for me, too, to dig up at this point,&#13;
especially in connection with your interest.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: And who was in charge of ag credit projects? Do you remember?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: The guy at the head of the agricultural department.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: [Lionel J.C.] Evans?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Evans, that's right. You're pretty good! Remind me of his first name.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
                                  William Diamond&#13;
                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Lionel, but he wasn't called Lionel. We had a different nickname for&#13;
him. [We called him Jim] And indeed for a long time Evans didn't want to talk to&#13;
me, but we became friendly in due course, and he has turned up about every five years&#13;
or so. I have several boxes of historical memos like this, but getting them, finding&#13;
them, is a job.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: The impression I have is that . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: This is in response to your question, "How come they went in different&#13;
directions?"&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Yes. The bigger problems, I think, have arisen with regard to the&#13;
ag credit project, I suspect. I'm not sure that's right.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I don't really know.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: We were at the short-term lending in most . . . It was quite a&#13;
different . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: It was a different business. Well, just a minute.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: And they had components or . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I guess it was mostly short term but not entirely. When I was head of&#13;
the [South Asia] department after the reorganization, one of our biggest borrowers in&#13;
India year after year was the agricultural bank, but I've forgotten what it was called.&#13;
What was the name of the big agricultural bank in India? It had about four words in&#13;
the titleâ&#128;&#148;Agricultural . . .&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: This was the one [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Oh, I can see the guy who was . . .&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: [Purviz] Damry?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Oh, Damry was at one point connected with it. Purviz, you mean?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: But by the time I knew him he was in the central bank. In any event we&#13;
were making loans year after year to this, and it may have been the biggest single&#13;
borrower in India during this period and before. But we were making loans to them&#13;
not simply for seasonal credit but for investment credit, for pumps, for the&#13;
improvement, for the digging of wells. Wells and pumps are more.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Cattle?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, in Latin America, Uruguay, Peru . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Peru?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: . . Paraguay, and . . .&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Central America, livestock?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Livestock, Uruguay. When I was deputy director there, there was a&#13;
loan that had been started well before me, but no money moved, for fencing and for&#13;
seeding and for wells; and nothing moved. They wanted money, and part of the&#13;
program was supposed to include fertilizer, but the Bank wouldn't finance fertilizer&#13;
because they said this was not a capital investment. This was annual maintenance. I&#13;
went to Uruguay a few months after I had become Deputy Director and realized from&#13;
talking to everybody what was going on. So I came up with a formula. The first&#13;
application of fertilizer to a field which had been an underdeveloped field but to&#13;
which you were fencing and welling and so forth and so on was an unusually heavy&#13;
one to get it started. I said this was not maintenance; this was a capital investment,&#13;
just as digging the well or putting up the fence was. The Bank bought this as part of&#13;
the program. Then the money moved, and thereafter that was included in subsequent&#13;
loans which were modeled over the Uruguay loan. I became deputy director for Latin&#13;
America in 1960, so I guess that loan was made in about '58, the one that hadn't&#13;
moved.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: But that isn't the first example of Bank lending for fertilizer.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: It was [as far as I know].&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: It became a big thing in South Asia later on.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, but that was another--you're right. It was part of the [both&#13;
speaking at once] program, I forget what it was called--import--program loan. [both&#13;
speaking at once] That's right, not SALs [structural adjustment loans] . SALs came&#13;
15 years later. You're quite right. That was a first, and it was only by my discovering&#13;
either through intelligence or luck that the first application was bigger, and I was able&#13;
to include it in the investment [loan? program?].&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Very neat. Well, I threw out more as a question, but it's an&#13;
impression I have, that the bigger part of the problem, the larger problem of DFCs&#13;
[development finance corporations] have been with the agricultural credit. Now, one&#13;
person that contributed to this impression was a conversation we had recently with&#13;
Hans Binswanger. I don't know if you . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: You know, it's funny. I know that name, but I'll be damned if I think I&#13;
know him! I can't attach any face to it.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: He came to the Bank about '79, I think, and he went into the&#13;
development economics department. He came from an ag research center in India&#13;
with . . .&#13;
&#13;

                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: . . . ICRISAT [International Crop Research Institute for the&#13;
Semi-Arid Tropics] , the CGIAR [Consultative Group on International Agricultural&#13;
Research] center in Hyderabad . . .&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: And now he's directing agriculture in Central America, and he&#13;
really gave a kind of broadside against the Bank's agricultural lending policies and&#13;
said that it had been largely disastrous and in particular all the area projects and&#13;
the ag credit projects in Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: This is a comment. This is to the Board's sixth annual review of&#13;
project performance audit results, 1980, in December.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: '80?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Right. Rates of return on agricultural credit projects. It says,&#13;
"During the Board discussion of the above a review of questioner was asked why&#13;
economic rates of return were higher for agricultural credit projects than other&#13;
agriculture projects and what lessons could be drawn from these results." So&#13;
at the beginning of the decade the Bank and its reviews were all showing that ag&#13;
credit projects had the highest rates of return. And so I think, one of the benefits of&#13;
hindsight, but at that time it's an interesting thing, which sort of shows how . . . Of&#13;
course, this says that the sample of audited projects was heavily weighted by India,&#13;
and the projects in India had all done very well. Same thing now, looking at it in the&#13;
â&#128;&#151;90s, ag credit projects in India in the '80s have been a disaster.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: You already made one comment about OED [Operations Evaluation&#13;
Department] . I never entirely understood our adoptive criteria for what's successful&#13;
and what's unsuccessful, especially when they attribute numbers to them. I just . . .&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: It actually, Richard [Webb] , and I'll get you the actual&#13;
correspondenceâ&#128;&#147;but there are lots of projects with a rate of return of less than 10&#13;
percent which they call satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Are there?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Yes, that is not the only basis.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: And the other way around too?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: The other way around I have to check, but I have seen projects&#13;
where the rates of return are six percent, five percent, where they said that despite all&#13;
that this is still a satisfactory project for a host of other reasons.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: And are those rates of return, do they . . . shadow prices, or are&#13;
they always really financial?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: They are all re-estimated economically which ostensibly includes&#13;
[shadow prices].&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Ostensibly, but do you know for a fact whether they actually&#13;
applied a shadow price?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: I think to an extent but not--to a limited extent, yes--but that's . . .&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: We don't know? We just think?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: No.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: When did Binswanger join the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: '79, I think.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: '79 or '80.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Or early '80. No, actually it was early '80.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: And when he was in the Bank did he deal with a lot of different&#13;
regions, areas?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Yes, because he was in development economics and tended to be&#13;
available for any . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Development economics?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Until '87, under Ben [Benjamin B.] King at that time.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Do you know Monty [Montague] Yudelman?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: I know him. I haven't talked to him now [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: You might. He's been around a long while, and he has a broad range. I&#13;
don't know when he came to the Bank, but it must have been considerably earlier than&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: '71 or '72.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: How do you remember all these things?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Well, I'm supposed to.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Why don't you speak to him?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: We have. John [Lewis] and I about six weeks . . .&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: I wasn't at the interview.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Richard [Webb] was putting . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Did you raise this point with him?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: No, unfortunately, we did not.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: I want to talk to him. [all speaking at once] That's a good reason&#13;
to go back to him.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Actually, I never worked with Monty, but he always gave me a good&#13;
impression, and as far as I know he was highly thought of always. He lives just two&#13;
blocks from me, but we see each other only when he's walking his dogs. He now&#13;
works for or he has an office in the World Wildlife Federation.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: He does some consulting work for them and either directly or through&#13;
them for the World Bank and others. I wouldn't suggest somebody like Evans, even if&#13;
he were here, because I really do think he would be tendentious. Monty, I think,&#13;
would be . . . By the way, Willi Wappenhans was a big shot in agriculture for a long&#13;
time. I do not remember when he left.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: He left in . . . We spoke to him . . . [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Wasn't it in '72?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Right, after the reorganization, but he gave us an excellent story&#13;
on agriculture 'til ['72] and I think from a lot of other records and sources including&#13;
from OED, those old hands in agriculture. There was a big story about Evans sort of&#13;
being--the story is that the Bank got the wrong "Evans."&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Got the what?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Got the wrong Evans. There is another J.L. Evans [both speaking&#13;
at once].&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: That makes me feel better.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: And that was in London, and then this Evans got the letter by&#13;
mistake and then promptly came, and they gave him the job. Whatever . . . Years&#13;
later the right Evans came to . . . and said, "Well, I never saw anything. You never&#13;
called me."&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: The guy--I can't think of his name for the moment but you must know,&#13;
who's the head of agriculture in OED?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Oh, Graham Donaldson?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes. I really don't know him--well, when I see himâ&#128;&#148;but he too gives&#13;
me the impression of being a pretty sound guy. He's another guy to raise this with.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: He's the one and his group of people that told us the story.&#13;

                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Wappenhans's story was quite critical on ag policy. I was&#13;
impressed by his general analysis. He suggested something that I found very&#13;
interesting. Maybe this is too vague. He likes to think of the Bank, coming back to&#13;
the godfather image, as having been very important in the early--let's say, in the birth-&#13;
-of a number of countries, all the new ex-colonial, ex-colonies and he thinks the Bank&#13;
should be seen in [that way] . . . in the '50s and '60s, that this was a big part of the&#13;
Bank's role in a number of ways. And this kind of fits with the role that the Bank now&#13;
would like to play in Eastern Europe and with many of the other countries that have&#13;
been born almost every year. I really sympathize with that, having been in a&#13;
government in an LDC [less developed country] . I felt so helpless. I really looked&#13;
and wished for the kind of wisdom that one could get from the World Bank or the&#13;
Fund [International Monetary Fund] . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Did I comment in there on the fact that often advice when it's&#13;
accompanied by money has a greater respect?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: I didn't see that.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I saw someplace yesterday or the day before my saying it, so I thought&#13;
maybe it was in there. Yes, for many countries I suppose that will be increasingly so&#13;
in Eastern Europe. That will be a major reason for money, to make advice palatable,&#13;
acceptable. A great deal depends upon the country. For instance, in India. The Bank&#13;
has been important in India, but I would guess, except for here and there, only&#13;
marginally. India is so big and the investment so great and its role in the world so&#13;
great that the Bank financially is more or less marginal. Do you think that's an&#13;
over statement?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Yes, except now. That's the irony.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: What do you mean, except for now?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: That now . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: They really need the Bank's money?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Yes. I mean, because of the foreign exchange crisis.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: A new foreign exchange crisis? That's right. I say, "new." Remember&#13;
the origin of the consortia?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: And "the three wise men" who traveled around Europe, or&#13;
traveled around the world--traveled in India and then later around the world. You&#13;
know what I'm referring to?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: No.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: When the foreign exchange crisis hit India in '60--'59?--the Bank was&#13;
always partial to India in many ways. Well, the reason was it was so big. India was&#13;
&#13;

                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
so big that the president of the Bank has always felt that he had to be the loan officer&#13;
on India, or at least the executive vice president on India. This is from [Eugene]&#13;
Black on. The idea of a consortium came up and getting bilaterals to invest as well as&#13;
private banks to invest, and the World Bank sponsored a three-man mission. One guy&#13;
was Hermann Abs, the second one was Sir Oliver Franks, and the third one was the&#13;
American banker who was the former head of the Federal Reserve of New York.&#13;
Remember his name?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: [Allan] Sproul? It's hard!&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I caught you! And they roamed around to get this first-hand&#13;
impression, and they were the guys who were responsible for helping back up the&#13;
Bank's push to create a special consortium to provide aid to India for the foreign&#13;
exchange crisis at that point. They were called "the three wise men." This year the&#13;
consortium produced, what, $5 billion, $6 billion?&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: I think six.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, when I was chairman of the consortium we were immensely&#13;
happy at one billion.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Yes, but in real terms . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I know, I know! In real terms--&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: We should have you back later for . . . quick&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: . . . is even less. There's no change at all. Real . . . capital.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Don't you get it in---oh, you have a different deflator for every year?&#13;
Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Yes, it's really interesting. A lot of the numbers change rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I know. I [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: You know, when you mention average loan size, and these . . .&#13;
figures, really the average loan size of the Bank has not changed. You know, $100&#13;
million in 1970 is equal to about $300 million now.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: And in addition if you deflated the World Bank's by the&#13;
borrowers' GDP--which has grown--as a proportion of GDP, there's no growth . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: You may want to think of another time to meet with me, if you want to.&#13;
But let me make a comment on this question about IFC, "Were the manner and&#13;
objectives of PFC [Private Finance Corporation] lending different when it was&#13;
located in the IFC than when it was in the World Bank?" At that time, no. It was the&#13;
same. After all, when it was located in IFC, we were given the responsibility for all&#13;
development bank work in the World Bank; and, when a World Bank loan was at&#13;
issue, my department in IFC wrote the appraisal report. Mind you, there was the&#13;
&#13;
                                  William Diamond&#13;
                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
working party system so that others could have input into it, and we wrote the relevant&#13;
section on the project and the marketing environment--let's call it that--for the&#13;
president's reports. This was part of the World Bank's report to the Board. There was&#13;
no separate thing. We looked at the same thing. This 1968 thing, I was in IFC. This&#13;
was a World Bank policy. It says a good bit about IFC too. So during that period in&#13;
the mid-'60s, there wasn't a difference. It was the same except, of course, that one&#13;
provided equity and the other provided loans. A time would come when it was&#13;
impossible to get a guarantee for a World Bank loan, so the IFC might give a loan as&#13;
well as equity. And because of that equity/loan situation [because it provided loans],&#13;
the World Bank didn't put people on boards. There was that one what I called&#13;
"aberration" in here, putting in ? [who -- Diamond does not know] on the board of the&#13;
Turkish Development Bank, but he wasn't the World Bank representative. And IFC&#13;
did enter lots of discussion and fighting both inside at IFC and . . .&#13;
&#13;
[End of side A of first tape. Side B did not begin until about 204 feet for some reason&#13;
and then was too fast up to about 205.]&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: . . . I think his daughter married the guy who became the&#13;
Minister of Finance in Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I don't recall Stanley, although at that time EDI [Economic&#13;
Development Institute] was a very close-knit institution, particularly . . . [tape ran&#13;
away with itself here, then ran perfectly to the end] . . . commented on some of the&#13;
purposes, types, and so forth; but to get an idea I think you really should take a look at&#13;
the [first] operational memorandum on DFCs of '68, and then I happen to have the&#13;
one from '70, although in this book you have some others. Here there's a big section&#13;
called "Main Features of Lending"--what we looked for, how the project was&#13;
described, withdrawals from the loan account, pre-approval of projects, commitments,&#13;
amortization, use of loan-per-share capital--this is what I just told you about--and so&#13;
forth and so on, audit requirements. That was something that I discovered was&#13;
abandoned subsequently.&#13;
&#13;
We had an absolute requirement that sometimes gave us great trouble with the locals,&#13;
that before a loan was made, the Bank had to have a satisfactory audit. This usually&#13;
meant, since not many developing countries had well-qualified auditing firms, an&#13;
outside company, Price Waterhouse or its equivalent, Coopers and Lybrand or some&#13;
such, and a lot of the development banks didn't want that. But I believe it [the&#13;
requirement] was ultimately abandoned. This was especially important when the time&#13;
came for lending to government development banks because government&#13;
development banks always had audits, but it was by government auditors who were&#13;
there primarily to see that the company was operating in accordance with the law--and&#13;
that's far from being the whole job of an auditor.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: I was wondering, if you had continued good auditing in the&#13;
development banks in the '70s, if one would have picked up signs of financial distress&#13;
somewhat earlier?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: After all, that's supposedly the whole point of an audit.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                      12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Maybe. I don't know. I wouldn't like to say.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: One of the things that also struck me, reading the oral history and&#13;
your own other papers, is the almost godfather's role that the Bank seemed to have at&#13;
that time, for instance, in appointing people. You have a number of . . . . I'm afraid I&#13;
don't remember . . . It's just gone into my general impression--quite interventionist,&#13;
helping, and informal in many ways. I have a sense that that role was very important,&#13;
the way you talk about this. I find this through the history of the Bank. The Bank is&#13;
always seeing itself as an advisory influence and so on, a fomenter. But when it&#13;
evaluates itself, it tries to boil everything down to a rate of return, a good investment&#13;
or a bad investment. Today people really believe in these numbers OED puts out. It's&#13;
a success or a failure, and that doesn't seem to fit very well with what the Bank sees as&#13;
its main function, but, of course, I can see it doesn't have a way to put a number, and&#13;
it needs to put some kind of . . . And it's a bank after all. But I think this certainly&#13;
evolved over time.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Let me make two comments on that. First of all, I think you're quite&#13;
right. Godfatherly, I guess in the good senseâ&#128;&#148;in the non-Mafia sense&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: The thing is in Spanish it's a very nice term.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I know. Last night Ted Koppel in speaking to Oliver North said, "You&#13;
were the godfather of such and such." He said, "But I mean that in the good sense!"&#13;
You're right. A great deal of it was [involved?] For instance, for years we were&#13;
bringing senior staff from the development banks, sometimes the number one man,&#13;
sometimes department heads, to have him spend a month or twoâ&#128;&#148;not a few days, but&#13;
a month or two--with Bank staff dealing with matters relevant to development banks,&#13;
putting him in the industry division to work side by side with someone who was&#13;
working on a good project. Now, this was very informal. I did it in my [department]&#13;
but I made the arrangements, not the World Bank. The only requirement was that we&#13;
didn't pay for it. If they could pay for it, I would set them up. And there was no&#13;
objection, no objection whatsoever. They came and spent a month with somebody in&#13;
the industry division. They came and went over into IFC. If they were an&#13;
engineering type, they would go into IFC's engineering department for awhile, and&#13;
they had an orientation. We did it totally informally, and it would not surprise me if&#13;
you were to discover that the powers that be in administration or management&#13;
didn't even know anything about it. I thought it was the right thing to do, and I could&#13;
do it then.&#13;
&#13;
There were lots of things, such as salary increases, which even I could do. When&#13;
McNamara came I wrote an 80- or 90-page paper [on the activities of the DFC&#13;
department]. It never went beyond draft. He wanted a briefing on development&#13;
banks. In there there's an annex in which it shows how many of these things we had&#13;
arranged for from the beginning, 1952, roughly, 1950-52, up until that time, the&#13;
summer of 1968. You can see it. It comes to quite a few.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Do you have the draft?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, I do.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: It could be really interesting to see those as sort of the way the&#13;
Bank informally . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: You'll even find McNamara's penciled remarks on the side. I've had&#13;
occasion to look at it. Well, I don't mind your seeing it, but you've got to look at this&#13;
as a quick draft.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Right. No, it's more the annex, these sorts of things, the informal&#13;
things.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, and I mentioned to you a few moments ago the effort we made to&#13;
put together a program of projects by these financed and the results from six&#13;
companies to start with. [We also developed an annual tabulation of the activities of&#13;
the institutions the Bank? financed and the results.] It was not just for the education&#13;
of the World Bank. It was for their education. We sent copies of those [annual&#13;
tabulations] to all the development banks after having gotten permission from the&#13;
company to do this, and, since a great many of the figures but not all were published&#13;
ultimately in their annual reports, most of them didn't have any objections. This&#13;
continued until about [several] years after the breakup of the development banks&#13;
department, and then it stopped for lack of interest. [In the early 80s, when I had a&#13;
job as a consultant for Harindar Kohli], Millard Long and I had a discussion about&#13;
this. It would have been his responsibility, and he tried to get it started but couldn't.&#13;
He and I had reasons to remember this a week ago when I was visiting with Long&#13;
because of something he asked me to do. This was a very useful document, but here&#13;
again it was for their education as much as for ours. One of the reasons no doubt&#13;
was the declining interest--which [as a result of] the [Fred] Levy report [Report of&#13;
the Task Force on Financial Sector Operations] is beginning to revive--in&#13;
institutional development. This was sadly neglected, and I think most of the people&#13;
who dealt with development banks for a long time, like Khalid Siraj, will tell you this&#13;
flat out--and others who've been involved in the business for a long while. There was&#13;
less interest in this, and this was not unrelated to the second factor, the shift of interest&#13;
from the development bank itself to the sector. And related to this also is the question&#13;
of apex lending because interest was shifted [from the real intermediaries to the&#13;
channel through which the Bank funds moved. You can see this] in that paper. [I&#13;
gave you that I understood the] reasons. But the fact is it distanced the Bank from&#13;
individual institutions until the mid-'80s reallyâ&#128;&#148;when the situation of the individual&#13;
institutions forced itself upon the Bank because of the increasing financial problems&#13;
that they were facing.&#13;
&#13;
So the links to the individual institutions were greatly weakened generally. One of&#13;
the bad things that's happened, of course, is that the people who remain in the Bank&#13;
dealing with financial institutions have had very little past experience of dealing with&#13;
them now because they came in in the period of the sector orientation with which, as&#13;
I've indicated, I agree entirely, but I don't agree with the abandonment of involvement&#13;
with the institution, individual institutions. They have less and less [institutional]&#13;
experience with them. The . . . policy of the Bank is increasingly important. The&#13;
rotation into totally different kinds of jobs especially at the division chiefs level&#13;
because at that point you're not supposed to know anything about substance. You're&#13;
supposed to be a manager.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: On this one aspect I find it a little hard to digest. They're called&#13;
development finance companies. In all the discussions about institutions, financial&#13;
roles, long-term lending, and so on in the capital markets, there is an absolute total&#13;
separation of agriculture from them.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, you asked a question about that.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: And you want to know why.&#13;
&#13;
INTERVIEWER: Yes, I mean, Levy now. It's one of the points he makes: there's&#13;
no reason for the separation. I remember being struck by it when I read The Road to&#13;
Huddersfield because it took me back to the mentality of the '50s when development&#13;
was industry. It was much more industrialization. The very title of the book just&#13;
expresses it so fully, and I can see that maybe that has something to do with it. Or&#13;
was it more a sense that agriculture was much different from this, or that the Bank at&#13;
that time just . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: [Lost in changing of tape] . . . merge in various ways. I think this is&#13;
related to the fact that the IFC--that my department was moved to the World Bank,&#13;
and IFC, to establish its separate identity in this field, began to focus on capital&#13;
markets per se. Mind you, if you read the early documents about the World Bank's&#13;
interest, you'll see that the World Bank was always interested in capital markets, but&#13;
for a whole variety of reasons, including the World Bank's statutes, they were locked&#13;
into the lending mode. They could still have been concerned with the sectors. The&#13;
Bank didn't become concerned with the sector until about ten years later. But IFC&#13;
began to focus on capital markets per se. Hi, John! [John Lewis arrived.]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I didn't get here in time to get . . . and I didn't get the interviews today noted&#13;
down at all.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, you can be in for the second interview, if there is one.&#13;
&#13;
This was focused by and large on one particular fellow, David Gill, who was&#13;
explicitly hired by Bill [William] Gaud to promote the capital markets area. David&#13;
was more and more interested, helped to drive IFC more and more into the capital&#13;
markets area and to decrease its interest in development banks except where equity&#13;
was involved, in which case there continued to be either IFC acting alone or IFC&#13;
working jointly with the World Bank in a joint operation of loan and equity to the&#13;
same company. But from then on, from the beginning of the '70s, you find a&#13;
decreasingâ&#128;&#148;I think, as I see itâ&#128;&#148;a decreasing amount of interest in development&#13;
banks in IFC and increasing interest in other types of financial institutions. Please&#13;
don't ask me to define "development bank" at this point. But it was then that they&#13;
began focusing on leasing. They began focusing later on venture capital, ultimately&#13;
on insurance and on commercial banking, commercial banks, and so forth. And the&#13;
&#13;
                                  William Diamond&#13;
                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
development banks that they were interested in were primarily those in which they&#13;
already had an equity interest, plus a few others.&#13;
&#13;
Then there was a knock-down drag-out fight inside IFC in about 1980, â&#128;&#151;81 between&#13;
Gill, still head of capital markets, and the regional department directors including&#13;
[Douglas] Gustafson, whom I mentioned to you, in IFC, because Gill was running his&#13;
department more or less as an independent enclave in IFC. The regions didn't know&#13;
what he was doing, and he wasn't interested in what they were doing. But from that&#13;
point on I think there was an edict issued by, in [Hans A.] Wuttke's time [roughly the&#13;
mid-80s], â&#128;&#152;81, â&#128;&#152;82, something like that, saying that even development banks, unless&#13;
work with them involved a carry-over from work that had been done in the past, those&#13;
two would be the responsibility of Capital Markets Development, CMD. From then&#13;
on there was very, very little in this field. My involvement with the Portuguese in--I&#13;
call it an investment bank; I think that's a better word for it--was one of the last of&#13;
those that were under the management of the regional head, and it still is except IFC&#13;
has gradually sold out most of its--the bulk of its holdings in that.&#13;
&#13;
So, as I say, during the '60s there was no difference between IFC and Bank because it&#13;
was all run by the same department which had responsibility for both parts.&#13;
Beginning in the '70s there was a divergence. This divergence created problems or&#13;
aggravated some problems between IFC and the Bank but also created problems,&#13;
bureaucratic problems, inside IFC itself which that edict of the early [mid] '80s was&#13;
supposed to solve.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There is one thing in particular I was just wondering about. In '64 when the&#13;
Bank's Articles were first amended to allow the World Bank to lend to IFC. Now, the&#13;
story which we've heard is that George Woods wanted to lend directly to the private&#13;
sector, wanted the World Bank to lend directly to the private sector, and that there&#13;
was a lot of opposition to that and that it was suggested to him that he could get&#13;
around that by simply lending World Bank money to the IFC which was already an&#13;
institution created under the banking group umbrella which could lend directly to the&#13;
private sector without guarantees. I'm asking this to sort of contrast that episode to&#13;
this year's episode around the IFC capital increase. It is also related to the World&#13;
Bank Group's sort of lending to the private sector without government guarantees. I&#13;
was wondering if you [could address this].&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: That first point doesn't soundâ&#128;&#148;your point, the argument that Woods&#13;
promoted the $400 million authorization and $100 million first loans to IFC in order&#13;
to get the Bank involved in private sector lending doesn't make any sense to me. I've&#13;
never heard it. My own interpretation of why he did it was that he saw, as many did&#13;
by then, that IFC, which had the potential of being an extremely important institution&#13;
in the world, as I believe it has now become, had no future at the level of 20, 25, 30&#13;
million of commitments a year. When Woods became president IFC was committing&#13;
about 20 million a year. When he left it must have been 60 million or something like&#13;
that. One reason it couldn't is that it didnâ&#128;&#152;t have any foreign [inaudible] [it had only&#13;
its share capital, a mere $100 million]. There was a big battle about whether it should&#13;
go to the market, internal battle, or should borrow from the World Bank. This is what&#13;
I understand. I gather than Woods's view at the time was that having another&#13;
institution, a quote "independentâ&#128;&#150; institution which had the same president and same&#13;
board of directors, going to the market simultaneously with the World Bank would&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
confuse things, especially since IFC was [to a large extent] then relatively an&#13;
unknown. It would be much better for us to do it. By "us" I mean the World Bank.&#13;
That makes sense to me. I don't mean his argument about why the World Bank&#13;
should lend rather than let IFC go to the market, but the argument that IFC needed&#13;
size, it needed size, and it didn't have one penny of borrowed funds at that time.&#13;
&#13;
The argument is also [often] made, as you know, often that [Martin M.] Marty Rosen&#13;
was very unhappy about the borrowing from the World Bank. He never told me this,&#13;
but it sort of rings true. He felt that it would result sooner or later in the World Bank&#13;
being excessively influential in IFC. It's true that the World Bank has [so been], but&#13;
it's been at the level of the president, and it hasn't been true through the lending that&#13;
took place at that time. Funding was size in Woods' mind. The Bank was lending to&#13;
the private sector at that time. [both speaking at once] Mind you, it had the&#13;
government guarantee through development banks and sometimes, as in the case of&#13;
India, the big steel companies.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: India Iron and Steel?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: India Iron and Steel had the government guarantee, I guess, but in India&#13;
government and big business is the same.&#13;
&#13;
But I've never heard that argument, and somehow it doesn't ring true [both speaking at&#13;
once] to me.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [Was there actually a] Board paper?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: In the what? Board paper?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes. And I have to go back to it.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, I'd love to see it because maybe it will trigger a memory. That&#13;
[the story about lending to IFC] doesn't sound right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But he . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I've got to go because I have a 12:30 engagement. You want to meet&#13;
again?&#13;

                                  Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: The major issue that I recall at this time was the program lending, and&#13;
the reason was as follows: the Bank had been making program loans in Pakistan and&#13;
in India for some time.&#13;
&#13;
In India every year there was one. But, if I remember correctly, the Bank was&#13;
satisfied on the overall program and then simply agreed on a list of goods for quick&#13;
disbursement, period. But for the first time, I believe, in Bangladesh we tried to link&#13;
the program lending to specific objectives. X amount was to go to revive the cotton&#13;
industry. Y and Z amounts were to go to revive jute or a certain amount of other&#13;
things. And we tried to lay out a programâ&#128;&#148;we tried to lay out a program of structural&#13;
adjustments or sectoral adjustments for those particular industrial sectors. It was not,&#13;
as in the other cases, simply drawing up a list of goods. It was trying to tie that list of&#13;
goods to a specific program of policy, investment, and production requirements. If&#13;
my recollection is correct, this was sort of a step, a tentative step toward something&#13;
which these days is called sectoral adjustment loans and SECALs. And whether this&#13;
kind of program lending, this modified program lending that Iâ&#128;&#152;ve talked about, was&#13;
continued after my time, I don't know. But we made two or three in such loans for&#13;
Bangladesh in the years that I was in charge, specifically oriented towards key sectors&#13;
with policy objectives as well as production objectives. I have forgotten about thatâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
youâ&#128;&#152;d better check that out.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What was the government's attitude towards that?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I really don't remember. I canâ&#128;&#152;t go into that. I was involved in that only&#13;
three years, and then it came to an end when I decided to move out and become an&#13;
advisor to the Senior Vice President for Finance. And then I had an operation which&#13;
knocked me out and which, with its aftermath, knocked me out of work for close to a&#13;
year. So I have no doubt that if I sit and think about Bangladesh, I'll recall things--&#13;
such as visiting with my wife just after the famous, the big, big typhoon, you&#13;
remember, when a half million people were killed, and then visiting Bangladesh a&#13;
year or so later, when I was in charge, going with David Dunn for my first visit to&#13;
Bangladesh and actually visiting some of the affected areas. But I don't remember&#13;
enough about Bangladesh really to talk about it.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: By early '71 you were already in South Asia?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No, from October 1, '72. That was when the reorganization took place.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, I see. I was wondering if you recalled any of the internal things in '71&#13;
when the Bank was sort of caught between India and Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No. I wasn't involved. That took place at the beginning--well, '71-'72,&#13;
as you say--and the McNamara reorganization took place as of October 1, 1972. It&#13;
was only then that I moved into South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What was your designation then in South Asia?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I was Director for South Asia. Technically it was called "Country&#13;
Programs, Department One," but I refused to sign myself that way and refused to put&#13;
it on my visiting cards. They were very mad because there was a rule about these&#13;
things. I simply put, "Director, South Asia," which covered India, Pakistan,&#13;
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Burma.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The definition of South Asia, I found, has changed so much. At one time&#13;
Iran was under it and Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: That's right, thatâ&#128;&#152;s right, thatâ&#128;&#152;s right, but that was a long time ago.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And then after '87 Pakistan was part of Europe and the Middle East, not in&#13;
Asia.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: That was after '87, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And now it's back under South Asia. And for us to get some data is just&#13;
maddening!&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Was it to you that I commented--certainly I have to others, and others&#13;
have to me--this business of dividing and re-zoning Asia has gone back and forth six&#13;
or eight times in the history of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Eight times!&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Maybe six, maybe ten! Look, before you proceed to ask me, may I add&#13;
a few things to last time?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: First of all, a correction. We were talking about those operational and&#13;
financial statistics which were created in that old DFC department, the DFC&#13;
department, and which we sent to everybody, you remember? And I think I said that&#13;
was abandoned in the middle '70s. In fact--I should have remembered thisâ&#128;&#148;it went&#13;
on to the beginning of the '80s, and Millard Long, who was in charge then in the&#13;
Industry Department, tried to continue it but couldn't. He couldn't for two reasons: it&#13;
had become a colossal job because of the number of institutions the World Bank was&#13;
associated with, and even with a special person on a computer they couldn't handle it.&#13;
More important, it would not be possible for one central person to obtain all the&#13;
figures without assistance, such as in personnel numbers and so forth, without the&#13;
assistance of the Bank's operational people. Millard tells me that he found it&#13;
impossible to get them to devote the effort or even to express, even to signify any&#13;
interest in these figures. I was able to persuade them, but then it was a smaller&#13;
business at that time.&#13;
&#13;
                                  William Diamond&#13;
                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In my time there was then one staff member managing the work, whom I hired&#13;
specifically for this purpose and a few allied purposes, who did all these calculations&#13;
by hand. We didn't have computers yet. This was a Korean whom I found as a&#13;
teacher in Lincoln College--or is it called Lincoln University?--in southern&#13;
Pennsylvania and who later on became a technical assistant to the ED [Executive&#13;
Director] , then an advisor to the President of Korea, then Deputy Prime Minister, and&#13;
finally governor of the Bank of Korea. Then he retired, and after all the murders, you&#13;
remember, in Burma--when 18 high officials were killed--he was brought back into&#13;
the government for a while. I believe at this moment he's head of the Korean Bankers'&#13;
Association. But you were aware of those statistics. You've seen them?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I have one here. I've forgotten how this subject came up. I think it&#13;
came up when you called me a "godfather." And that's the next thing I wanted to&#13;
comment on, the "godfather" concept in the good sense of the term.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: For me it's good.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: And I must say the more I thought about it, the more I liked it in the&#13;
usual sense, and the more I remembered which had slipped my mind. We persuaded&#13;
or twisted arms of Bank and IFC people to prepare for us bibliographies of&#13;
publications on the subject of development banking or of interest to development&#13;
banks. We sent these bibliographies to them all, free of charge, as a service. I don't&#13;
know whether you have ever seen these bibliographies. I recently had a chance to&#13;
look back over them because Millard Long was writing an article, and he needed to&#13;
add a bibliography. There is no bibliography on development banking around, and I&#13;
was able to produce these. They're old, but [they get you started?] For instance, I got&#13;
the engineering department of IFC to do a bibliography of technical books, articles,&#13;
and journals which a well-run development bank ought to have in its library. This&#13;
was a 15- or 20-page affair. A general bibliography was started by the same Korean&#13;
who did the financial and operational statistics. Later it was completed by a Burmese&#13;
girl who worked for me whose father Sanlin was a middle-level official in the Fund.&#13;
Valerie had a U.S. degree in economics. We revised this several times in my time,&#13;
and even after my time I was able to get IFC to update the engineering bibliography&#13;
once or twice. I personally then sent them to everybody as a "godfatherly" act.&#13;
Maybe we should call this a "grandfatherly act."&#13;
&#13;
Next thing, we talked about training. One matter I forgot. When a new bank came&#13;
into existence or when an old one was expanding, we offered to take care of some of&#13;
their senior people at times. We would bring them to Washington one at a time.&#13;
They would spend a few weeks with us, either in my department or in one of the&#13;
technical departments, which was much more interesting because they participated in&#13;
actual industrial appraisals, appraisals of commercial institutions. I would reach an&#13;
understanding with the head of the department. "Mr. X wants to come here. I think&#13;
he would do well here. Please assign him to a division of a person who has an active&#13;
project before him, so the â&#128;&#151;traineeâ&#128;&#152; can sit with him and work with him--he can be his&#13;
assistant, if you wish, but work with him through the appraisal process."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  William Diamond&#13;
                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Then I also tied them up with our more advanced development bank friends abroad.&#13;
They would go, for instance, for one to three months to ICICI [Industrial Credit and&#13;
Investment Corporation of India] in India or to the Industrial Development Bank of&#13;
Canada. (Now it's called the Federal Business Development Bank of Canada.) The&#13;
World Bank had no formal connection with it, but I had one because we used them for&#13;
various training purposes and we used their general manager as a consultant. They&#13;
would go up there and spend a few weeks, again with the understanding that they&#13;
would be put into a specific department and work. We also used the Industrial Credit&#13;
Corporation of Ireland, which is a pretty good institution, and a few others with good&#13;
experience. I preferred to put most "trainees" in a developing country rather than in&#13;
Canada or elsewhere, Ireland, because they would feel more at home in the kinds of&#13;
problems that were being encountered. I didn't get any approval for this from&#13;
anybody in the Bank, but then we didn't charge anything. The "trainees" had to pay&#13;
their way. We laid on the program for them here and with other development banks&#13;
abroad. ICICI sent people year after year, six, seven, eight people, the Industrial&#13;
Development Bank of Turkey, PICIC and many others. After our department&#13;
dissolved in '72, this was abandoned. I should have remembered this when we last&#13;
spoke.&#13;
&#13;
In the briefing about development banks that I prepared for McNamara when he came&#13;
to the Bank (about which I told you), there is a table which says how many of these&#13;
"trainees" came, who they were, and to what companies they belonged, during the&#13;
years 1962 when the department was created until 1968 when I prepared this briefing&#13;
for McNamara. Here is a copy of the briefing. The operational statistics and&#13;
bibliographies, we've talked about.&#13;
&#13;
Then, finding people for senior staff. That, I think, you questioned me about last&#13;
time. We did find people to be the number one man or number two, either as advisor&#13;
or actual manager. And again there are statistics here in the briefing on the years&#13;
when we were doing it. The table goes back to the very beginning of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And finally, something I had forgotten completely about, but again it's in this book I&#13;
sent to McNamara, what I called our special information service. We would send&#13;
them, the development banks, copies of documents that the World Bank produced,&#13;
sometimes people outside produced, which we thought would be of interest to them.&#13;
Here is a list from my note to McNamara. We'd send the document with a covering&#13;
letter saying in effect, "Here is this. You'll be interested in such and such," and it was&#13;
for their library and for their information. That was abandoned. I put that also under&#13;
the heading of the "godfather" or "grandfather" activity.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: All of these things were abandoned?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes. Then, I must tell you from a strictly personal point of view--all of&#13;
this in a sense was personal, you see; I took it fairly personally--but from a strictly&#13;
personal point of view I'm going to show you something which to me was the acme of&#13;
godfatherliness. It's rather amusing. In about 1972 or 1973--I've forgotten when--&#13;
somebody came back from Korea and said to me with a smile, "I was very interested&#13;
in your collected papers." I said, "What are you talking about?" He said, "Didn't&#13;
you know that the KDFC" (which is now the Long-Term Credit Bank of Korea--it&#13;
was then called the Development Finance Corporation of Korea) "has put together a&#13;

                     October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
series of the letters and memoranda you sent to them from '67 to '72 both as an&#13;
introduction to the background policy of the company and as a guide to how to write&#13;
good letters in English?" And I thought he was pulling my leg! So I wrote to them&#13;
KDFC and, yes, this is what they sent me.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, my!&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: August 1971. Look at the introduction. That's the President who later&#13;
became Chairman. Anyway, I put that under the heading of "godfather." You're not&#13;
interested in this, I presume.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, we'd like to see it.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Would you like to glance through it?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What we'll do is make a copy of it.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: You can make copies of anything you want in there.&#13;
&#13;
Now, another subject I want to amend or to amplify: you tried to question me about&#13;
why McNamara brought development banks back to the Bank out of IFC. I never&#13;
knew but I gave you my guesses, and one of the important things was the issue of&#13;
volume. It was becoming a big business and would become much greater under&#13;
McNamara and would continue to grow even beyond McNamara. And this, bringing&#13;
it back to the Bank, resulted in a divergence of views between the Bank and IFC on&#13;
development banks. You remember, I told you that when Gill joined IFC, he was put&#13;
in charge of a new department. It wouldn't touch development banks, and I think this&#13;
was an extremely important matter resulting in a division of, a rather significant factor&#13;
in the divergence of views between the Bank and IFC on the subject of financial&#13;
institutions in the â&#128;&#151;70s. From that time on, without at first abandoning development&#13;
bank activity for which I was their (IFC's) technical advisor, they focused more and&#13;
more attention on the capital markets rather than DFCs. Gaud issued executive orders&#13;
(or whatever they were called) and public statements about the reasons for setting up&#13;
this department.&#13;
&#13;
But it had some consequences. They began to think less of institutions per se than&#13;
they did of capital market policies and began to think more and more also of the&#13;
financial sector as a whole. Before the Bank got into the act, IFC began in a small&#13;
way to focus on the capital market in the early '70s. The Bank didn't expand into this&#13;
area until the end of the '70s, the beginning of the '80s. So you've got the beginning&#13;
of the emergence of the divergence between the two institutions in this area, the Bank&#13;
continuing to focus on development banks, whatever they are, and IFC on the&#13;
financial sector, especially the capital markets part of it, and was concerned with&#13;
public policy and legislation and other kinds of acts necessary to produce an enabling&#13;
environment for the capital markets in its member countries. So in a sense IFC was&#13;
the Bank family's precursor, beginner, of the financial sector orientation.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One might have thought that this could have been or ought to have been&#13;
just the reverse, that the IFC would have been the transaction-oriented institution,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  William Diamond&#13;
                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
would have actually focused on the GNP, whereas the Bank with its larger economic&#13;
focus would have focused on the financial sector, enabling environment, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, one might have thought that. The first part of what you say was&#13;
the case, IFC's concentration on development banks while the Bank-wide department&#13;
was there, but when it moved over here, they then began to pursue a different kind of&#13;
course.&#13;
&#13;
There's another factor, I think. Beginning around that time the Bank became&#13;
overwhelmingly interested in disbursements, capital transfers, and you don't get fast&#13;
capital transfers when you focus on policies and creating an enabling environment.&#13;
The Bank was more interested in quick loans, making them quickly, getting the&#13;
numbers up, and that may have been one reason for the delay in focusing on the&#13;
financial sector. Also, at that time the development banks at the beginning of the '70s&#13;
still weren't doing badly. It was only with the changed world and national&#13;
environments of the late '70s that they began to do very badly, and then the Bank's&#13;
attention was sharply focused on this, not by an act of will or an act of intellect but by&#13;
externally induced necessity.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: When is your sense of--although you were out of it--that the whole DFC&#13;
business or some of the DFCs, or your sense of some degree of uneasiness? Do you&#13;
remember a particular incident?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: '75, '78, '80?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No. But, you remember, this was happening just as I was leaving the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: They were still doing pretty well. You saw that paper by Ravi Gulhati&#13;
and me. They were doing pretty well financially in '73 when we wrote that. Our&#13;
problem was with their development orientation.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There's a Board paper in '75 on DFCs.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Oh, a DFC policy paper? Yes. This was when Gustafson had become&#13;
head of the rump of the department. What's this say in effect, anything? Good or&#13;
bad?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Basically that it's a pretty good thing.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: That's what I would have thought, and I believe the operational&#13;
memorandum of '76, which you have or is in that black book, is fundamentally the&#13;
same as the original one . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Of '68?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: . . of '68, as modified in '70 and in '72 with the main differences being&#13;
opening us up to government development banks and a few other things like that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: So then, of course, in '76 was my big operation. In '76-'77 I was pretty&#13;
much out of the picture except on the fringes. When I began to return to work, it was&#13;
six months later and then only part time. And I was in things totally different.&#13;
&#13;
So I had my friendships and my personal links, both abroad and at home, but my&#13;
sense is that this began happening at the end of the '70s. But you'll have better&#13;
sources of information, and there will be lots of documents.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I mentioned Khalid Siraj last time. I urged you to see him, and I said&#13;
that he was the head of a task force on the financial problems of development banks.&#13;
He was also a member of the recent Levy task force. He probably knows more about&#13;
DFCs than anybody in the Bank group now, but he headed an early task force--I don't&#13;
remember the exact date, but it would have been the end of the '70s, beginning of the&#13;
'80s--on the portfolios, what's happening to the portfolios of the DFCs which were&#13;
going sour. There's a report on that. He will be able to give it to you even if you can't&#13;
find it in the files. But that's my sense, around that turn of '79-'80.&#13;
&#13;
Now, you asked for my briefing to McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, Bill. This point about the IFC capital market as being sort of a&#13;
precursor.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: You probably won't find many people who've ever said this, and you&#13;
probably won't find many--certainly not in the Bank--who will agree with it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But you said there was an element of some transfer of persons or ideas to the&#13;
Bank? Or was it kind of an accidental parallel?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, there certainly was a transfer of ideas, but remember these dates&#13;
we were just talking about. The capital markets department was set up in 1970 or&#13;
1971--probably that winter, the beginning of '71--and that's when they began the new&#13;
focus of IFC's interest, and they were very slow getting started.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank didn't really begin focusing on the financial sector until the end of the '70s,&#13;
beginning of the '80s. And I would say that what was most influential on them was&#13;
the deteriorating portfolios of their development banking clients, not the transfer&#13;
of ideas. Transfers of ideas back and forth between IFC and the Bank have not&#13;
always been the easiest thing in the world, as you no doubt know from many things.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Why do you think that has been? I mean, one might as well at some times&#13;
say that IFC ought to be a completely separate institution, given that the tension&#13;
between them has not really been a creative tension?&#13;
&#13;

                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Two days ago when I had lunch with Bilsel Alisbah, he was talking&#13;
about the same thing, and he agrees with me that the blame rests with people on both&#13;
sides. Year after year, or every other year at least, some kind of task force is created&#13;
to work out an accommodation, a modus operandi, modus vivendi, between them, and&#13;
then every year or every other year they have to go over it again. The latest one was&#13;
just this year in a document that was prepared for the signatures of [William S.] Ryrie&#13;
and [Moeen] Qureshi, which appears as an annex or an appendix to one of the policy&#13;
papers at the beginning of the year. But four years ago Douglas Gustafson was the&#13;
head of one with the directorâ&#128;&#147;with Amnon Golan--when the latter was head of the&#13;
Industry Department, which no longer exists. Golan is now head of EDI.&#13;
&#13;
I don't know why this is. Now, one of my guesses--I thought I had mentioned this the&#13;
other day here, but I certainly referred to this in speaking to Bilsel Alisbah. On the&#13;
Bank side, even though I would guess three-quarters of the World Bank has no&#13;
recollection of Robert Garner and Marty [Martin M.] Rosen--never knew them--the&#13;
feelings that they engendered among Bank people when they were the heads of IFC&#13;
have lingered on. Garner was an extremely nice guy but an outspoken apologist for&#13;
the private sector. Mind you, the apologism was primarily in speeches and writings,&#13;
not in the way in which he behaved. Nevertheless, there it was in his speech. You&#13;
can read about his speeches in the newspaper, but to know how he behaved, you have&#13;
to read appraisal reports and so forth. And it was easier to do the former than the&#13;
latter. And in the case of Marty Rosen, an extremely able but aggressive person, who&#13;
had both staunch personal allies and staunch personal enemies; he was able to make&#13;
them both, like many good people do, in fact. And that seems to have lingered on.&#13;
&#13;
And then another factor, of course, which didn't exist at that time but it has existed&#13;
increasingly since, has been the scale and the overlap of operations. At the time in the&#13;
'60s when Garner left IFC and when Rosen began, they were doing about $20 million&#13;
of business a year. And when Rosen left I think it was up to $60 or $70 million a&#13;
year--just peanuts! But now it's a billion and a half dollars a year and growing.&#13;
People forget that in the beginning it was so small in large part because of the fact that&#13;
the IFC had only $100 million of capital--period. And you don't invest it all in one&#13;
year even if you can. Now it's a billion and a half, and you have to multiply that by&#13;
six, seven, or eight in order to see what their impact on investment has been. This is&#13;
what they have generated from other sources, much of it external sources.&#13;
&#13;
And when it comes to private sector activity, which in the past five years or so has&#13;
become a key policy in the World Bank, there is obviously room for some dissension,&#13;
which staff down below fight about--its turf, its lending, or investing. It's adding&#13;
$100 million in this institution's balance sheet or in that institution's balance sheet.&#13;
They can't solve it among themselves; it can be solved, if at all, only by the top&#13;
bosses. And I don't think it will ever be completely solved. Fortunately always until&#13;
now good sense has prevailed in the end, so it's been toned down from time to time.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's something I hadn't even seen that way. It's an interesting angle to&#13;
locate for this [history]. Before it was almost irrelevant in the Bank, proportional&#13;
growth of the IFC and the friction with the Bank--I find it especially interesting. It&#13;
comes to another of the points that we wanted to raise. It comes to the private sector&#13;
and government orientation. You have had so much to do with that. To me it's one of&#13;
the big mysteries of the IFC, not being ever really taken up by people who have&#13;
&#13;
                                   William Diamond&#13;
                     October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
wanted to push the Bank more into the private sector, and it always seemed the IFC&#13;
was an instrument just sitting there.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, you have to modify what you're saying. Every time one writes&#13;
one sentence or utters one sentence you need at least a page to spell it out. Don't&#13;
forget the Bank was a very strong advocate of the private sector from day one, an&#13;
extremely strong advocate of the private sector. This was [Eugene] Black's&#13;
philosophy. It was Garner's theology, and the private sector orientation of&#13;
development banks and the private sector orientation of industrial lending all started&#13;
long before IFC in the Bank. And then the Bank gave up its vice president Garner,&#13;
who was the acme of private sector theology, who became the head of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
But even though the Bank had this very strong theology, its lending was&#13;
overwhelmingly in the public sector. And this was because predominating at that&#13;
time in the Bank was the view that the private sector is best helped by creating the&#13;
public infrastructure that they need. They needed roads to get their farm products to&#13;
market. Otherwise it would rot, as it did indeed in many places. One of the first loans&#13;
we made to Turkey was for silos. Why didn't we lend for highways? Because the&#13;
U.S. government had a tremendous program of lending for highways, and we were&#13;
going to create storage facilities to assist in this process of getting products to market.&#13;
One of the first two loans we made to Ethiopia was for highways. Another one was&#13;
for telecommunications which was important not only for private sector development,&#13;
but more importantly in Ethiopia for administration, public administration. The&#13;
government couldn't get word from Addis to Jima. So the infrastructure was&#13;
transportation. It was irrigation facilities. It was big-scale agriculture of that time,&#13;
agricultural assistance. It was ports and railways, hydroelectric power. This was&#13;
what dominated the Bank for a long time, up until the beginning of the '60s. So this&#13;
was a view of how you promote the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
Today there are different views of the development process. Everybody has more&#13;
experience with development and the problems, and there's more to an enabling&#13;
environment than having a highway. But there it was, and the IFC was brought into&#13;
existence precisely because--by the way, another factor in the World Bank's neglect in&#13;
terms of direct lending--a loan to the private sector needed a government guarantee&#13;
under the Bank's Articles of Agreement. First of all, many governments wouldn't give&#13;
it. India was an exception. They would; they did; they do.&#13;
&#13;
Other governments wouldn't dream of assisting in the direct financing of a project.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Did Korea allow it?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, but the KDFC was private. That was 1967. That may have been&#13;
the first private sector loan we made in Korea. The previous ones would have been&#13;
infrastructural.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, other than through DFC?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I don't remember any others.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Like even in industrial lending?&#13;
&#13;
                                   William Diamond&#13;
                     October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, it did, in India Iron and Steel, in which consultant George Woods,&#13;
by the way, was very instrumental. He was one of the key players in that. So in many&#13;
places the government wouldn't do it, and in even more places the private sector&#13;
wouldn't accept it because the government guarantee to them implied, in due course if&#13;
not immediately, government intervention or a perception of intervention. Then came&#13;
the IFC with no money, or virtually no money, as I pointed out in my article on "A&#13;
stroll down memory lane." A hundred million dollars is nothing, even with the&#13;
relatively limited view of what was needed in those days. By the way, when you&#13;
translate some of those early statistics into today's dollars, the picture isn't quite so&#13;
bad as it sounds. Twenty million dollars per year in 1962 was a lot more than $20&#13;
million today.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And per person? When you make it per person it's a lot more.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, exactly.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It "doubles" the value of all the numbers. Do you recall why was it that&#13;
while the World Bank capital--over time, they managed to get a lot more leverage out&#13;
of the capital by reducing the paid-in portion, so ostensibly $180 billion dollars when&#13;
actually paid in is approximately, would average out to about five percent, but for IFC&#13;
everything has to be paid in.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: It's a different kind of company. You'll have to read the proceedings of&#13;
the creation of IFC to get your answer. IFC is quite different from the Bank. It's an&#13;
investment company. You can ask, "Why didn't they borrow?"&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. Or even in this new capital increase.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: When IFC is borrowing, don't forget they're engaged in equity. You&#13;
don't invest borrowed money. You can re-lend but in the kind of things they do&#13;
without government guarantee. Remember, every World Bank loan has a government&#13;
guarantee. It is either to the government so it's a sovereign loan, which very often is&#13;
far from being as good as a private loan.&#13;
&#13;
But why didn't they borrow? In the old days there was a matter of policy involved&#13;
also. It was felt that IFC borrowing would complicate the picture for World Bank&#13;
borrowing. While not legally a subsidiary of the World Bank, it has the same&#13;
president and the same board of directors and some--in those days--senior staff.&#13;
Today there is no senior staff except for the president which is in common. Even at&#13;
the time when under George Woods for the first time they were authorized to borrow&#13;
from the Bank and the Bank was authorized to lend to it, there was discussion as to&#13;
whether IFC should borrow independently, borrow on its own, and his strong feeling&#13;
was that it wouldn't be good for the Bank's picture. But then time marched on. By&#13;
the way, I wasn't in any way involved, and I don't know anything about the discussion&#13;
that took place when IFC first borrowed directly. When was that? Ten years ago?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Early â&#128;&#151;80s, yes.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Something like that, yeah. I donâ&#128;&#152;t know what kind of discussion took&#13;
place then, but I donâ&#128;&#152;t think that an investing institution can get along with having X&#13;
amount of subscribed capital and then borrowing on the basis of the total amount.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Investment is a fraction of the total outflow.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: It was very confined at times.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Very.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Speak to the IFC people about that because you will get a richer&#13;
picture. Well, IFC came into existence. It couldn't do a great deal, but even so, as&#13;
I've mentioned someplace--you may find it in my interview--there developed in&#13;
IFC's first two years a strong sense in IFC that the World Bank was competing&#13;
unfairly with it in lending to financial institutions and to private enterprises because&#13;
the World Bank was lending in effect subsidized money. World Bank money isn't&#13;
quite market money, no matter what the Bank says, and it was getting a government&#13;
guarantee which enabled it to do that. And there are memos from Garner on the&#13;
record--I have some--to Black in the Bank when Garner was president of IFC saying,&#13;
"You're undercutting our investing, our lending to the private sector." At that time the&#13;
IFC could not invest in equities. "You're undermining our lending to the private&#13;
sector, either directly or through financial institutions because you're able to lend to&#13;
them at a lower rate, either directly or through financial institutions." There wasn't&#13;
any direct lending then to financial institutions, and this subject got quite hot between&#13;
them in '61-'62, and it came to a head towards the end of '61. The debate went on in&#13;
'60 and '61. It came to a focus at the end of '61 when Black transferred responsibility&#13;
for all development bank work--and a year later it was done for all private industrial&#13;
financing--to IFC so that IFC in effect became the center for the Bank Group of&#13;
private sector investment activity.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Then this broke down at the end of the '60s after McNamara became&#13;
President. So this story you were telling is a story with cycles, if you will, with&#13;
variations, changes. There is an evolution there with confusion in the end.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: At the end I guess you had discussed in the Burke Knapp report of '88 . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I'm going to stop you right there. Please don't call it "The Burke Knapp&#13;
Report." You must know the history of this.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Burke made a complete mess of it, and it's not his report in any sense at&#13;
all.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Okay.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                     28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: The report that he produced was rejected; it didn't get to the Board,&#13;
fortunately. It was rejected and his committee, his task force, was dismissed, and two&#13;
people, Johannes Lind and Douglas Gustafson, were asked as a new team to rewrite&#13;
the report from scratch. Now ask your question!&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One of the things was again this whole thing between IFC and the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, but they tried to avoid that question. It came in towards the end.&#13;
They couldn't avoid mentioning it, but I think they recommended further examination&#13;
and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: This question about relations, you would do well to ask Gustafson. He&#13;
goes back to the days I hired him when I was in IFC in 1963 at the beginning, really,&#13;
of our development bank work. Then he headed the rump of development bank&#13;
activities in the World Bank after we moved after the reorganization. Then he&#13;
was on the Golan committee to accommodate IFC and IBRD. Then he and Johannes&#13;
Linn did this. And he's one of the people in IFC who knows the most about such&#13;
institutions from long experience and has seen these changes, these variations over&#13;
time. And Linnâ&#128;&#147;I don't know him very well; I've met him--he's a very able fellow. I&#13;
don't know how interested he is in this subject. Gustafson will be interested, although&#13;
at the moment his overwhelming interest is Eastern Europe, obviously. Everything&#13;
else is of secondary importance to him.&#13;
&#13;
They couldn't avoid the subject entirely. That was a real mess, the preparation of the&#13;
"Knapp Report."&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Why did that happen, given Knapp's reputation?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, but you can't rely on reputation by never being here. He was an&#13;
absentee chairman of the task force. This was number one. He rarely came. He&#13;
would come for two or three days at a time every month or two. That was that. Then&#13;
there was a . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What year was this?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Eighty-eight. I remember saying this to him. He spoke to me twice&#13;
about the work on the committee, once at the beginning and once at mid-stream, and&#13;
to others.&#13;
&#13;
And then the staff of his task force, which consisted of high-level people of the staff,&#13;
had two heads in effect, one from IFC and one from the World Bank. Well, that's fine&#13;
if you have a strong boss here to control them, but there was no strong boss here, and&#13;
they went their different ways. Then they, the two bosses, commissioned the studies,&#13;
[Anthony A.] Churchill from the Bank and Jean Philippe Halphen, who is a very able&#13;
guy, by the way, very able, from IFC. But with few exceptions I know they were&#13;
advocates of a particular position favoring their turf. I remember I must have seen six&#13;
or eight of the IFC papers. Only about two of those were good, objective&#13;
&#13;
                                  William Diamond&#13;
                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
presentations. The one of them I felt was particularly good was by Richard Frank,&#13;
who is one of their vice presidents now. It was a good, balanced thing, but I could&#13;
cite one or two that were completely turf dominated.&#13;
&#13;
So there was no boss, a divided thing, a divided staff, advocacy on both sides. And&#13;
then finally a report which both sides, both some IFC members and some World Bank&#13;
members of the task force, the seniors, refused to sign. Knapp had approved it. He&#13;
probably hadn't read the thing! It was a sorry performance.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That raises one of the questions that floats there for me because it has to do&#13;
with the big counter-factual thing about the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: The big what?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Counter-factual.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I know what you mean.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And the IFC in a sense has always been there as a reminder of a different&#13;
route that could have been taken. My own sense of this is that the Bank could have&#13;
earlier on, very early on, have decided to go much more into brokering, co-financing,&#13;
serving as an instrument, and I think it was seen that way at the very beginning. And&#13;
if it didn't go that way, I guess, I suspect that it's because the people who controlled&#13;
the Bank have always been very interested in influence, in influencing everything that&#13;
has to do with policy and demonstration and teaching, leverage, and the route the&#13;
Bank took really afforded a lot more opportunity for that than IFC would. Does that&#13;
sound really off track?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, it has elements that are right and elements that I can't say are&#13;
wrong, but I'm not sure I agree with you. You said that the Bank was in the early&#13;
days very much interested in brokering, focusing, and they did, but if the Bank was&#13;
interested in influence primarily, which means engaging in direct activity, why do you&#13;
think they were focusing more in the early days on brokering, on getting co-&#13;
financing? I don't know much about co-financing from first-hand experience. You&#13;
must remember--I think this is correct--that until about four or five years ago, co-&#13;
financing was not part of the operations complex and the operations business of the&#13;
World Bank. It was dealt with separately under finance. It's only--was it with the&#13;
reorganization of â&#128;&#152;67?--that it became a . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I think you mean '87.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, '87, excuse me, that it became a part of the vice presidential&#13;
barony under Qureshi, and it became part of operations. I'm simply trying to excuse&#13;
my relative ignorance of this subject. I was always in operations, sometimes on the&#13;
country program side, sometimes on the project side, technical side, but never on the&#13;
financial side. So you must take a look at not only the speeches but all the statistics of&#13;
co-financing from the beginning on. Co-financing and joint financing are the two&#13;
things. Excuse me, I guess A projects and B projects. That's joint financing, isn't it?&#13;
And that was well on the way before '87, but you must take a look at the statistics on&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                       30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
how it developed in order to help you formulate the question better and get somebody&#13;
more knowledgeable on this than I am.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, on influence, yes. It's interesting that you should say that the Bank has&#13;
always been interested in influence because this has a bearing on one of the points I'm&#13;
going to ask to speak about later on, if you will allow me. It means that the Bank was&#13;
interested in policy early on, too, from day one. Remember that question that came&#13;
from the floor supported by two people and there was a burst of applause. I guess that&#13;
was the occasion for the burst of applause when John Lewis spoke to the 1818&#13;
Society. Don't think this policy started with SAL, that the Bank's interest in policy&#13;
started with SAL. It started from day one. This lay behind the EDI. Eight years&#13;
before EDI was invented, it lay behind the General Survey Mission Reports. It lay&#13;
behind a lot of Bank direct technical active assistance activity. I guess it was in the&#13;
'40s. Wasn't it first in the '40s that the Bank sent people to Ecuador and elsewhere to&#13;
help establish a basis for and a policy towards the establishment of markets in&#13;
government securities? Ecuador sticks in my mind; I'm not sure why. So, yes, the&#13;
Bank has been interested in policy. But I'm suggesting to you that in the financial&#13;
institutions field and the capital markets they were in that by the beginning of the '70s.&#13;
&#13;
But more importantly, you know, advice, no matter with what an open heart and a&#13;
good mind it's given, is made far more effective when it's accompanied by money,&#13;
and there was lots of money here compared with IFC. You don't get much advice&#13;
accepted when you're dealing with one investment of one and a half million dollars or&#13;
three million dollars or a half million dollars as IFC was doing in the early days. But&#13;
if you take a look at the IFC now, it's quite important in the area of advice with&#13;
respect to privatizations, with respect to all the elements of the enabling environment&#13;
for the private sector. And this is not only because IFC is on the map, which it wasn't&#13;
30 years ago, but also because IFC has more money and more capacity to get money&#13;
from others than it had then.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It's friendly advice rather than conditionality now?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, ask them or read more of the appraisal reports than I have read&#13;
because my experience is much narrower today than it was 30 years ago. But you&#13;
take the setting up of "my" excellent company in Portugal. When I came into the act,&#13;
IFC had been giving advice for two years. But what was the advice? It was&#13;
concerned with the legislation which would enable investment banks to operate. No&#13;
private bank could be established in Portugal at that time, and so it was set up&#13;
originally as an investment company, but there was no legislation for an investment&#13;
sociadada business. It was not possible to set one up, so there had to be legislation,&#13;
and the legislation was faulty in many respects. And this went on for a long time, and&#13;
there were other elements of government policy, similarly now with respect to&#13;
privatization and other activities related to the private sector. If you mean by what&#13;
you say that the conditionality is not a part of the investment agreement, yes, because&#13;
the investment agreement is always to a company not to the government. But if you&#13;
mean that they go ahead with the investment without any link to the advice, I don't&#13;
think that's always true.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's a matter of degree.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I'm a little bit curious about the seeming contradictions. On the one hand&#13;
one always hears and believes that influence cannot be effective unless accompanied&#13;
by money.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I wouldn't say that. That's not always true. I say that here. I think it's&#13;
an important element at this political level because when you're talking about&#13;
influence on the government, you really are talking about politics. It's not just&#13;
a matter of economics.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And so on the other hand there is also the sense that it was the emphasis on&#13;
money [that] perhaps really undermined influence in the '70s.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Say that again?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Perhaps the whole emphasis . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Loan pushing . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So it was that that really undermined it, rather than getting [the Bank] more&#13;
[influence]. So you get a sense that too little money is ineffective and too much&#13;
money is also ineffective.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: If you speak to me, I personally have felt that with the tremendous&#13;
expansion of the Bank during the period when it was dominated by the view that&#13;
capital transfer was the crucial thing, there was an undermining of the quality of&#13;
World Bank lending, and, although I hadn't thought about it, maybe also the&#13;
influence. I say that from only limited personal experience because I left the Bank in&#13;
'78 after I had my big operation. I'd seen case after case for four years before I got&#13;
outâ&#128;&#148;three years--where the conditions, including policy conditions and corporate&#13;
conditions, if you will, project conditions, were not ready but the loan had to go&#13;
forward because it was scheduled and it was part of the projection of the Bank's&#13;
capital transfer.&#13;
&#13;
So I used to say that if a project was late or threatened to be late, even for the best&#13;
reasons in the world, the country didn't suffer; the staff who were responsible for the&#13;
project suffered because they got it in the neck for not being on time. Well, you&#13;
know, when you're dealing with such matters as influence and project structure, it's&#13;
not always easy. It's not a matter of a design, a simple architect's design. But,&#13;
Devesh, you've suggested a hypothesis. There may be something in what you say.&#13;
I wouldn't like to defend that if it's on the influence side. I hadn't thought about it.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One hears this frequently about, you know, [how] staff would get it in the&#13;
neck, but I have had difficulty getting examples. What would happen, what happened&#13;
to people who said, "This project is not ready and not ready to go through"? I mean,&#13;
in the end, unless the staff . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: They were told to do it? No, the staff didn't have to go along. If you're&#13;
told to do it, fine. The staff didn't have to agree. They could recognize difficulty. I&#13;
&#13;
                                   William Diamond&#13;
                     October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
guess I could mention two countries, including a loan for a development bank. There&#13;
were things wrong with the borrower bank--here I'm not talking about influence; I'm&#13;
talking about projects per se--and nobody denied it. But the ruling comes ultimately,&#13;
not necessarily from the president, who is often personally involved in it but not&#13;
always, but from the area department or regional vice president or area department&#13;
director: "You've got to get this out before the end of this fiscal year. It was&#13;
scheduled for January. Okay, you can have it until February. This is as late as we&#13;
want the appraisal to be." So you did it.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So then what it means is that people like Burke Knapp and the other&#13;
regional VPs sort of always went along with it.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes. You know, you say, "always went along with it." I don't know&#13;
whether they always went along with it. Even when I was in the act, I didn't know&#13;
everything that was going on by a long shot. I knew what was going on in my region.&#13;
I knew what was going on before the reorganization in the development and&#13;
finance institutions area, but in the region I was focused on South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
I couldn't swear to how much resistance, if ever, Gerry [Gerald M.] Alter put up or&#13;
the two regional department heads. But I had a strong perception, and I know that&#13;
others had the same perception in the areas they were working on. But to say&#13;
â&#128;&#149;alwaysâ&#128;&#150; is probably too much.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: For four years--over four years, I guess it was--we had several missions&#13;
to Afghanistan while I was head of the development bank department to examine the&#13;
feasibility of a DFC there. One of them was led by Bulent Yazia of Turkey and&#13;
another one by Gasem Kheradjon from Iran. Both times the answer was negative.&#13;
And from my general knowledge of the area, added to their view, I agreed with that.&#13;
Aand we kept saying "no," until the orders came after one Annual Meeting from&#13;
McNamara: "We've got to do it," to make a loan for a new development bank in&#13;
Asia--excuse me, in Afghanistan. And so we proceeded, doing things in a&#13;
"godfatherly" way and doing one thing at least that had never been done before.&#13;
Knowing quite well that they would have to get a general manager or president or&#13;
whatever from outside, I approached my Indian friends, H.T. Parekh and S.S. Mehta&#13;
in ICICI, for help. They strongly recommended a fellow who was then the head of&#13;
the Maharashtra Finance Corporation, and I took him on my staff a full year before&#13;
the time came to put a manager on the Afghan institution. I met this man and talked&#13;
to him at great length, brought him into my department so that he could learn more&#13;
about such institutions outside Maharashtra and also so that he could be part of the&#13;
development process in bringing that company into existence. He later came back to&#13;
the Bank for a few years, by the way, and now is back in India.&#13;
&#13;
But the orders came from McNamara: "You've got to do this!" I don't know how he&#13;
got "this." He was a close friend of Bob [Robert R.] Nathan. Bob Nathan used to&#13;
come in and have lunch with him fairly frequently, I understand. Bob is a good friend&#13;
of mine, too, long before McNamara. But Bob's consulting company had a contract&#13;
for general economic advice, policy advice, to Afghanistan for about 15 years, and he&#13;
was strongly pushing the DFC. He used to be on the phone to me, and he had the&#13;

                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, a political scientist from a California university,&#13;
whom I met once on a visit to Afghanistan after the company was set up. He would&#13;
come through here, and I would make sure that Bob introduced him at some point. He&#13;
was strongly in favor. Whether it was these, whether these exercised some influence&#13;
on McNamara, I don't know. What I do know is that the orders came through: do it.&#13;
&#13;
In Senegal we had missions, and we turned down loans for a new DFC. We turned&#13;
them down for year after year until an Annual Meeting after I left the Asia Region.&#13;
Douglas Gustafson got the word from McNamara that we must proceed with the&#13;
Senegalese institution, and one of Douglas's staff, Jose Luis Monlira (?), left to&#13;
become its manager. The Bank ultimately made a loan and IFC an equity investment.&#13;
The thing went broke after about eight years. I don't know how much the investors&#13;
got back, if anything. I'm not saying we were always right. That just happens to be&#13;
the case here. What I'm saying is that orders did come occasionally, and then we did&#13;
it. I can see some kind of orders that I might have gotten that might have led me to&#13;
resign, such as being told we must make a loan to an Afghani institution or to a&#13;
Senegalese one. Fortunately, those orders came after my time.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And McNamara was not open to arguments with the professional analysts?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No. First of all, I didn't have a tremendous number of meetings with&#13;
him. I have my papers on that, which you also asked for. We talked about&#13;
professional things. I don't know why in Afghanistan's case. He knew the results of&#13;
our studies because I had told him, and you'll find Afghanistan in the agenda&#13;
several times, my agendas with him. He could very well have decided with a&#13;
completely open mind that Bob Nathan had a much better knowledge and was much&#13;
more credible about Afghanistan than Bill Diamond. I can't say that he decided the&#13;
other way as a result of a closed mind. And, by the way, if it comes to general&#13;
knowledge of Afghanistan, I'm sure he would have been right in saying that the other&#13;
fellow knew more. No, you can't say "closed mind." I think he probably did on some&#13;
things, but then we all have closed minds on some subjects, regrettably. [both&#13;
speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: We couldn't do anything if we didn't.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I know! Otherwise we'd never make up our minds. You better make&#13;
sure that sentence is on the record!&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I always had a strong sense when I was in government, once you were in the&#13;
job, there was no time anymore. It was too late to think much about it. You had to&#13;
work on rules of thumb that you had learned along the way.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, yes, but some people, strong people, do leave positions, but it's&#13;
got to be an issue of overarching significance, not on the investment of two million or&#13;
three million. It wouldn't have been more than that in Afghanistan, and that's all [not&#13;
a lot]. No--or Senegal.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: To round off the conversation, one of the things I haven't gone into very&#13;
much, I think, is the problems, and just why such severe problems.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Problems for whom?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In the DFCs, in these last ten years.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: You mean problems of the companies themselves? Why did they&#13;
develop such problems?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes, these loans and projects which have particularly severe difficulties.&#13;
Would it be fair to say, do you think, that these institutions were particularly sensitive&#13;
to the policy environment? Is there something here that has made them more quick to&#13;
wilt in a bad environment than other kinds of projects? Particularly vulnerable?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, I don't know that they're more so than other types of projects.&#13;
They have caught the attention, but it would be interesting to study the question--&#13;
maybe you've done it. Mind you, I don't believe all of OED's figures by a long shot.&#13;
They measure success and nonsuccess in ways (A) which I haven't quite understood&#13;
and (B) and which I think are dubious. If I can't understand them, I shouldn't say that&#13;
they're dubious, but I think they're close to being so. And I think you'll find that there&#13;
are a lot of other classes of projects which have had great problems sector-wide. I'm&#13;
told--but you must check this out obviously--I'm told it's true of agricultural credit.&#13;
It's a somewhat different animal but still credit. I'm told this is true of the Bank's&#13;
projects which had dealt with migrations of people.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Transmigrations?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Transmigration. In Indonesia there's a spectacular case. And other&#13;
classes. What kind of problems the DFCs had is easier to answer than why it should&#13;
have been more susceptible than others. Incidentally, there have been a few good&#13;
little papers or good write-ups of this, and some which I think are bad. One of those&#13;
which I think is pretty well balanced is in the 1989 World Development Report.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The one on finance?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, the finance one. Millard Long, I think, did a pretty respectable job&#13;
of balance. One of the things I liked about it was that he did say something about the&#13;
world environment at that time. The world environment of the '70s was not good, and&#13;
when that's bad, then business is bad in individual countries. And if business is bad in&#13;
individual countries, the development banks feel it because their clients can't export or&#13;
sell at home, and then they can't pay their debts, and the DFCs have their problems&#13;
which led to the Khalid Siraj task force on portfolios.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: . . the world situation. I said that I thought that Millardâ&#128;&#152;s study of about&#13;
1989 had a fairly balanced view of this. My problem with most of the other stuff that&#13;
came out from the World Bank is that they never took this into account and just said it&#13;
was all the fault of--not the fault of the DFCs but the fault of the World Bank for&#13;
promoting the "wrong model" of a DFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   William Diamond&#13;
                     October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But certainly the world and national environment of the 1970s was not very good for&#13;
private business, and this affected all development banks, state as well as private.&#13;
Then another factor in many cases was poor management of the DFCs. And here I&#13;
think that the Bank has a little bit of--I shouldn't say "responsibility"--but a&#13;
contributing factor. I have talked about training as one of the "godfatherly" aspects of&#13;
our relationship with many development banks, and you will find it in some of my&#13;
talks. I point out that there was an important limitation to our training. We focused&#13;
on the appraisal and supervision of projects, of their projects. I don't recall that we&#13;
ever did anything for them or to them with respect to the management of liabilities. It&#13;
was the management of assets and especially the acquisition of investment assets, and&#13;
supervising them, that we concentrated on. It was their project cycle in effect, to use&#13;
World Bank language. The management of liabilities, all the issues that come under&#13;
that heading, we never touched. And I guess this partly resulted from the ignorance&#13;
of many of usâ&#128;&#148;I put myself in that category--but partly also it was a reflection of&#13;
what most of us were doing in the World Bank. Ninety percent of the World Bank&#13;
staff or more were in operations which meant allocating resources. Only a very small&#13;
staff were in mobilizing resources. We were all elite.&#13;
&#13;
And we were carrying this over because this was, rightly or wrongly, where we&#13;
thought their main problems were going to be. And even when the EDI for the first&#13;
time got into the business of training development bank people formally--I guess their&#13;
first course was in 1973 when V.V. Bhatt came from India and remained here until he&#13;
retired and is still living here. It was to a very significant extent focused on--&#13;
overwhelmingly, I guess, focused on--promoting, designing, evaluating and&#13;
supervising investment projects. Little on the resource mobilization side or on&#13;
managing liabilities. The development bank managers who were very good, those&#13;
who were very good and those who were bad, got whatever knowledge they needed&#13;
on this side of their operations--and, of course, it was important for all of usâ&#128;&#148;from&#13;
other sources, chiefly from their own background experience. All of them were&#13;
deeply involved in management of liabilities but sometimes lacked the knowledge&#13;
they should have. Views of liability management and capital adequacy are changing&#13;
everywhere.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Not only in LDCs but also in the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I realize that; I said the whole world and Europe. I guess Europe to&#13;
some extent is taking the lead in this. I said a second and crucial factor was&#13;
management. I just brought in the question of the kind of training that we provided as&#13;
being weak from one point of view for management. But there were other aspects of&#13;
poor management, too. Mobilizing resources is a harder job if you look at most&#13;
institutions as a whole than is allocating. And many development bank managers&#13;
found it much easier to get money out of the World Bank and their governments&#13;
than to go to the market. So long as development banks were--as they were in the&#13;
'50s, '60s, and early '70s--the fair-haired children of the World Bank and of&#13;
governments, it was pretty easy. We were easy touches.&#13;
&#13;
I see examples of this from my own experience with them. I often tried to be tough&#13;
but very often was told I couldn't be because the regional departments said we had to&#13;
go ahead with a loan. I had already given the NIBID [National Investment Bank for&#13;
Industrial Development S.A.] of Greece notice that they had received the last World&#13;

Bank loan. The head of the development bank was an old friend of mine. He had&#13;
worked in the World Bank and IFC. He stopped talking to me for more than a year,&#13;
never corresponded. However, after a period of inactivity in Greece, the World Bank&#13;
decided it had to have a new loan to Greece to signify its turnaround on lending to&#13;
Greece. Nothing was ready. Nothing was prepared except a development bank loan.&#13;
We were always prepared for a new loan because of the close touch we kept with&#13;
them. We were always prepared to say "yes" or "no." I mean, on the basis of&#13;
continuing contact with a borrower we were up to date with where they stood. And I&#13;
remember saying to Munir Benjenk, "With your agreement, indeed on your initiative&#13;
because this institution is ready for graduation, we told them they had had the last&#13;
loan.â&#128;&#150; "Never mind. It's the only thing we have. There are no other immediate&#13;
lending prospects." Benjenk was then the vice president of EMENA [Europe, Middle&#13;
East, North Africa] . So we made NIBID another loan.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: This was when: '57,'58?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: No, no. This would have been at the end, late 60s or â&#128;&#151;70-â&#128;&#151;71.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Just after the colonels' coup?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: It would have been linked with the colonels' thing. When did they&#13;
finish? Do you remember? It was a little later than that. It was toward the end of&#13;
that. Must have been the beginning of the '70s.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I think I've read about this. Somewhere someone alluded--maybe one of&#13;
the ex-staff members in one of his letters . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: To this project?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, it didn't say which project. It said how . . . as soon as a dictatorship&#13;
comes in. This was a reference to the colonels' coup and how we went ahead . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: This incident lingers strongly in my memory, first because George was&#13;
a good friend and it resulted in a break for about a year or a year and a half. Second, I&#13;
remember the occasion so well because we were having dinner, the two of us, with&#13;
several others from the Bank and IFC at the home of Harold Linder. Does that name&#13;
mean anything to you?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Harold Linder had been head of the Ex-Im Bank [U.S. Export-Import&#13;
Bank] for several years, a New York banker. Then when he left Ex-Im, he came into&#13;
IFC as a representative on the boards of several banks.&#13;
&#13;
In Spain he was on the Board of Bandaco and in NIBID. It was a celebratory dinner&#13;
at his home on the signing of what we thought would be the last loan. George was&#13;
there; he had come to sign. I was there. I made the announcement to George:&#13;
"Delighted, but this is the end for you. You have graduated as an institution; you're&#13;
pretty good. You can do your own borrowing in the market."&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What was the surname?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Gondicas.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I remember now. He was one of the persons that you recommended to me&#13;
in that conversation that . . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Oh, really? You told me that you had a conversation.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes, well, that's right.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: It was easy to lend to them, and besides being in the international bank&#13;
family, that's a possibility of not of free travel but of [end of tape]&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: . . directly poverty-oriented things and safety net and so forth, and they&#13;
had to compete with others for loans. And the same thing was true of governments.&#13;
And in the '80s governments were getting to be very much strapped for resources.&#13;
And so all these factors I think were involved.&#13;
&#13;
I should mention another criticism that appears in the Bank's recent literature on&#13;
DFCs: a fundamental error in the DFC's design, in the Bank's model for a&#13;
development bank. Maybe so, maybe not. But the people who say that forget that&#13;
these things were being invented in the '50s and the '60s, and not only was the world&#13;
environment changing, but so were the national environments. A model that I used,&#13;
in accordance with which we helped to promote various institutions in the '50s and&#13;
'60s, is not a model that I would use today in all countries. I probably would in some,&#13;
but not in all. Beginning in the early â&#128;&#151;70s you will find speeches and articles I wrote&#13;
in which I noted the inadequacy of this model in the light of changing circumstances&#13;
and began to stress the need for strategic planning by DFCs to adapt themselves to the&#13;
new circumstances. The Bank didn't begin to worry until various development banks&#13;
became or threatened to become insolvent. Many development banks themselves&#13;
weren't affected even by that, because they continued to believe they would be bailed&#13;
out and get more capital from their governments and from the World Bank--and by&#13;
and large they were correct. The point is that they did not have either the managerial&#13;
will or the institutional capacity to adapt themselves to changing circumstances both&#13;
at home and abroad.&#13;
&#13;
There was very little planning in any sense. There was very little strategic planning--I&#13;
mean looking ahead and changing their policies in accordance with environmental&#13;
changes and changing their objectives, if need be. I don't mean their fundamental&#13;
objective of helping to develop the country, but the instrumental objectives of what&#13;
they would focus on. A few development banks did from the beginning adapt, KDFC&#13;
eminently so. KDFC changed pretty radically the form of the institution, and invited&#13;
me to plan this transformation in 1977, ten years after it was established. To give you&#13;
one impressive statistic, when we helped to set up the KDFC in 1967, exports were&#13;
around $250 million a year. When I went back for a review of their structure with&#13;
them in 1977, ten years later, exports had hit $10 billion a year. That's just one figure.&#13;
&#13;
                                   William Diamond&#13;
                     October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It happens to be spectacular, but everything else was proportional. The city of Seoul&#13;
was a different world compared to the one I had first gone to in '67. They adapted.&#13;
Others did. Some did not. Some wanted to but couldn't, inhibited by law, by&#13;
government policy or by various objective circumstances in the country, other factors.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Which are the ones that you look back on and say actually were success&#13;
stories? It's a subjective call, of course.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: It is a subjective call, and one has to ask you what you mean by&#13;
"success" because they may have been developmentally oriented, which would be&#13;
success for some people, or they may have been profitable, which would be success&#13;
for other people. For me, it would be a mixture of doing good and doing well. I think&#13;
Korea falls eminently into that category. Singapore was eminently so, too. ICICI was&#13;
deeply inhibited by Indian law and custom and practice, deeply inhibited. It was&#13;
privately owned but government controlled in a way because that was India, but I&#13;
believe it adapted by going into many new lines of activities and being active in the&#13;
market, promotions, and so forth and so on. These three stand out.&#13;
&#13;
Thailand, the IFCT [Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand] went through a&#13;
period of doldrums for a long time, until it got a first-class manager. By the way,&#13;
IFCT always had a Thai one. I don't think we ever pressed on them a foreigner as&#13;
manager, although it has had foreign advisors, but also it became quite important, not&#13;
in quantitative terms but qualitatively in terms of the new things they did and the&#13;
kinds of activity. IBID was a success in my view, at least until [George] Papandreou&#13;
came to power. And now perhaps I can mention the company IFC helped promote in&#13;
Portugal, and with which I have been connected from inception: BPI [Banco&#13;
Portugues de Investimento SA]. I would now rank it as the prize among those&#13;
companies I have known reasonably well. There are others.&#13;
&#13;
Notice I've mentioned three on the Pacific Rim, which makes a point, one point which&#13;
I've made in various papers. You cannot divorce the relative success or failure of&#13;
development finance institutions from the relative success or failure of the economic&#13;
performance of the country itself. We're talking about NICs or near-NICs when we&#13;
speak of Korea, Singapore and Thailand.&#13;
&#13;
I'm told that the Malaysian Development Bank is now a respected and influential&#13;
institution, but I don't know enough about it. Certainly it was having all kinds of&#13;
troubles when I was involved with it. (It did have two foreign managers, by the way.)&#13;
I would not have put them near the top, but I'm told it is now getting along extremely&#13;
well.&#13;
&#13;
Most of these institutions, like institutions in developed countries, have their ups and&#13;
downs. I've mentioned a few; I haven't mentioned all. The Turkish Development&#13;
Bank we thought was very good in its first ten years. It turned very bad, and when I&#13;
was ultimately sent back in '82 (by the Bank) it was only because, while the Bank was&#13;
appraising a new loan--appraising a new loan which it insisted on sending to the&#13;
Board--it discovered that the company was virtually insolvent. The Bank went ahead&#13;
and made the loan, and I was asked to see what I could do about assisting or at least&#13;
reorienting while the Bank itself proceeded (A) with the loan and (B) in helping to&#13;
persuade the government to provide the resources needed to buy TSKB's way out of&#13;

&#13;
its problems. That's an example of the cycle DFCs--and other institutions--go&#13;
through. This is not a definitive answer to your question, but some examples.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The African ones, almost all . . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, although I had mixed feelings about the Moroccan one. For a&#13;
while it got along extremely well. Then it virtually went to pot. I went back three&#13;
times in the early '80s for reassessment and advice. I'm told that it has since revived.&#13;
&#13;
Why did it go to pot, why? Chiefly because it took foreign exchange risks which (by&#13;
contract) were supposed to be taken by the government. The government did take&#13;
them in the sense of signing a contract, but it didn't pay up. Secondly, it borrowed&#13;
short and lent long! And when things began to go bad in the world in the '70s and the&#13;
early '80s, both of these things which management had done--why? in an effort to&#13;
grow, grow, growâ&#128;&#148;the chickens came home to roost. I strongly recommended&#13;
against new loans by the World Bank, and the World Bank held off for several years&#13;
until it felt that they had corrected their situation adequately. But then much to my&#13;
astonishment and despite two long, bitter memoranda that I wrote to the people in&#13;
charge, the IFC did make two loans in a row. I know the IFC people who were&#13;
involved; their concern was that here was an opportunity. There are ups and downs.&#13;
&#13;
I've lost track of my Latin American friends. There's only one that I feel because of a&#13;
recent revival of knowledge I think has been doing quite well, and it has gone through&#13;
some rapid and significant transformations, in Colombia. If I had been asked at the&#13;
time I left development bank work if there was one financiera in Colombia on which I&#13;
would place my money--we were invested in five at that time; ultimately the World&#13;
Bank lent to about ten of them--I would have chosen two. I would have put at the top&#13;
of the heap CorporaciÃ²n Financiera del Valle in Cali and the CorporaciÃ²n Financiera&#13;
Nacional in Medellin. Del Valle had an absolutely first-class manager who retired&#13;
there a few years ago after a long time on the job and was replaced by another first-&#13;
class fellow. I have renewed contacts with them recently, and they seemed to be&#13;
doing very well in terms of diversification of their activities and adaptation to a new&#13;
world and a new financial sector. Medellin's Nacional, I just don't know. I was quite&#13;
surprised to discover lately that the one that was the biggest and most powerful but in&#13;
my opinion not the best of the financieras, Colombiana in BogotÃ , had declined, and&#13;
both del Valle and Nacional are now bigger and much sounder in condition, especially&#13;
del Valle.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I guess there would be the exceptions. Again, the environment has to have&#13;
helped a lot. It's the only country that didn't have a debt crisis or changes of . . .&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: But I don't know. Except for the changes at the top, I don't know&#13;
enough about the individual companies to know why BogotÃ  sank and del Valle's star&#13;
shot upward and has continued to do so. Mind you, Cali and its region were in my&#13;
time a very productive and dynamic community, the heart of the sugar country, and&#13;
many other things. On the other hand, Bogota was a huge metropolis, industrial&#13;
center, administrative heart of the country. Although in those days, if you asked a&#13;
fellow where he came from, "Do you come from Colombia?" He would say, "No,&#13;
I'm from Medellin."&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Very regional.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Very! I don't know whether that's still true. I guess to some extent it's&#13;
still true, but they must have outgrown that to some extent. They had to.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One aspect of the DFC history that strikes me is that I have the impression&#13;
that there's no other area of lending in the Bank that for so long a time was so much of&#13;
a one-man show, where one person had so much input. Is that right? Do you think&#13;
it's fair?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, you must be talking about me. Well, first of all, I had a lot of&#13;
good people on the staff. Gustafson was very, very good--and still is. He's really a&#13;
top fellow in every way, personally and professionally. And there were others. I&#13;
mention him because I've mentioned him several times already, and he's worth your&#13;
seeing. But I'd like to think that I helped to give it some direction and leadership and&#13;
some sense of esprit de corps.&#13;
&#13;
Certainly one of the factors involved in my being able to do that was the role which&#13;
IFC was given for the World Bank group from '62--that's when the department was&#13;
created--from '62 to '68. IFC had the role of promoting the private sector, number&#13;
one. Number two, it wanted development banks to be an instrument through which it&#13;
would spread its influence in other countries. It knew it couldn't know everything that&#13;
goes on in other countries, but through good corporate partners like good&#13;
development banks they hoped to be informed of what's going on, they would be&#13;
informed of opportunities. IFC would be part of a network. Did I mention this is my&#13;
big interview of 1986?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: And then the third thing is Marty Rosen, who rubbed many people the&#13;
wrong way and probably me, too, occasionally) because he could be very tough and&#13;
abrupt, was a terrific teacher. But aside from being a teacher, he and Woods allowed&#13;
me to move. So I was able to develop that influence which carried over into the&#13;
World Bank for my next four years, from '68 to '72. It carried over there but&#13;
necessarily dwindled as the Bank changed and more emphasis was placed on the&#13;
regions and the regional departments rather than on the technical or project&#13;
departments. I considered mine in that category. And I never had the standing, nor&#13;
did the department, with McNamara that I had with Rosen and with Woods. So this&#13;
was far from being a one-man show. It would be nice to think that I helped to wave&#13;
the flag at the right moment, both vis-a-vis the department and vis-a-vis the outside&#13;
world. And maybe a lot of these "godfatherly" activities vis-a-vis the outside world&#13;
helped in this respect, too. But I'm trying to think who would have been in a&#13;
comparable position in the other departments. Sorry, I just can't think of any at the&#13;
moment. What was your question? Was it true that this was a one-man show?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you think that was a fair assessment?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, you heard what I just said. It wasn't a one-man show.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, I mean . . .&#13;
&#13;
                                  William Diamond&#13;
                    October 23 and November 1, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I'd hate to think that I was!&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It's more a certain identification of DFCs and your name. No other name&#13;
really springs out for, say, the power sector or irrigation or highways or roads.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Yes, I will accept that a little more quickly than I will accept the "one-&#13;
man show" description. Maybe it was because, too, we wrote a lot about it. Well, I&#13;
shouldn't say that because there was lots of writing about power. I wrote one book&#13;
and edited and wrote the introduction to another in this period. There were lots of&#13;
talks and articles in various journals in that period. Maybe that helped to link it to me.&#13;
Of course, I am prepared to accept paternity for all the successful development banks,&#13;
but not the others! At least I can find good excuses for their being.&#13;
&#13;
But I really can't accept the view that the design was entirely wrong. After all, we're&#13;
talking about something invented for the world of the '50s, and it was consistent with&#13;
the prevailing philosophy. It wasn't entirely my invention. I had some role in the&#13;
invention maybe, certainly in the propagation, but today it's not something that I&#13;
would be going around selling everywhere. I would in some countries that I can think&#13;
of, in central Africa or elsewhere where you can't talk about the market or mobilizing&#13;
many resources, but I'm not sure you could argue that it was inappropriate in all the&#13;
countries in which it was used in the '50s and above all in the '60s, which is when the&#13;
big push took place, a big push in the sense of the number promoted.&#13;
&#13;
By the way, one of the annexes is the numbers promoted from the beginning of the&#13;
World Bank to the late '60s.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes, that one also has these numbers.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Which one?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The policy paper.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Could be. I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It has them in the annexes.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, yes. I didn't write that one. I guess I saw that in draft.&#13;
Gustafson, apparently. I guess I would sort of like to. It's probably correct.&#13;
Gustafson is very careful. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, I don't know about trying to go on. How do you feel?&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: I can go on for awhile, but I want to show you some papers, and I have&#13;
some suggestions that I want to make to you, unconnected with that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Okay, sure.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Shall I do those?&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                      42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
DIAMOND: Well, I made notes about these right after theâ&#128;&#148;in fact, I made notes in&#13;
my little pocket diary as John [Lewis] was talking and as people were asking&#13;
questions, just points that I wanted to stress--some of which we've already stressed--&#13;
but let me just mention them.&#13;
&#13;
I was delighted, as you know, to hear him say in his second tentative conclusion--I&#13;
keep telling people that they should not think of John's points as conclusions but as&#13;
hypotheses for the moment, tentatively, but I'm sure he'll stick with this. I remember&#13;
his first one was that he was not going to be rewriting Mason/Asher; he would be&#13;
reviewing it in the light of new facts and new evidence and so forth. But a second one&#13;
says its time for a reassessment of George Woods, and it should be. He did much&#13;
more than he was given credit for. You know that that's my view because I've said it&#13;
before in various ways.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, I guess it was Dick [Richard H.] Demuth who raised three questions.&#13;
When John gave his outline, Dick said, "But you haven't mentioned A, B, and C."&#13;
I've forgotten what one of them was, but one had to do with IFC, and this really&#13;
worries me. For gosh sakes don't forget IFC. It's an extremely important institution,&#13;
and there are many problems connected with it as well as potentials connected with it,&#13;
problems in terms of links with the Bank, coordination, and what not. You referred to&#13;
the possibility of merging them, but that's one of the things often talked about by&#13;
some people, denied or refuted by others, but it's extremely important. It's not&#13;
obvious to me from John's outline how, where, the IFC fits into that outline. I realize&#13;
that, in the titles of the 10, 11, or 12 chapters he mentioned--I'm speaking of volume l,&#13;
not volume 2--it's obvious that in the titles of the chapters he couldn't mention every&#13;
subject that you'll be dealing with. But every important subject should be able to fit&#13;
into one of the chapters so you have a place in a chapter, even if you don't have a&#13;
chapter on the subject itself.&#13;
&#13;
In the Mason/Asher book, you remember, there was no chapter on IFC but it had a big&#13;
part in several chapters. The first one that it had a big part in was chapter 3 or 4 or 5&#13;
called "The World Bank and the Private Sector," and it was natural to fit IFC into that.&#13;
And then it came up in various places after, including that big last one on the issues&#13;
for the future.&#13;
&#13;
It's not obvious to me where IFC fits in your scheme. Maybe you have a place for it;&#13;
maybe you need a special segment on it. But IFC is sufficiently important now to&#13;
justify very close attention both for good and for ill. So I agree entirely with Dick&#13;
Demuth in raising that issue, and I wanted to stress that to you.&#13;
&#13;
Another thing that he said that was not obvious from John's outline was where the&#13;
subject of debt would be treated. Now, I know debt is on your mind. I think John&#13;
mentioned that someplace along in his talk. But I just wanted to make a point.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
There were the three volumes by [Dragoslav] Avramovic, which were pioneers in&#13;
dealing with the debt problem of LDCs. I had lunch with Dragoslav last week or the&#13;
week before, and I asked him, "How did they get into this that long ago?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Don't you remember"--I didn't, although I could have imagined it--"that&#13;
Garner became extremely concerned in the middle '50s about the creditworthiness of&#13;
many of the big borrowers?â&#128;&#150; And so he specifically asked that the economics people-&#13;
-and Dragoslav was one of the senior ones--make a study of debt and its implications.&#13;
So Garner was the promoter of that study. It's worthwhile looking them over. I don't&#13;
mean that you have to deal with them, but they deserve a reference. They are&#13;
mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
By the way, I checked to see if there were references to this in the Asher book. There&#13;
are; they're in the footnotes. But they're a little more important now than they were&#13;
even when Mason and Asher were doing their history because the debt increased later&#13;
and the Bank was deeply concerned and involved in the period you will focus on.&#13;
&#13;
Dragoslav said something else at our lunch. This I can't affirm now because I have&#13;
forgotten much about the contents of the book. Dragoslav never forgets something&#13;
that he writes; I sometimes forget something I read. He made a very strong case for&#13;
the need for debt relief and for soft lending--soft in the sense of low-cost lending. I&#13;
know I have at least one of those volumes someplace at home; I didn't go back to look&#13;
it up. If it's true, then this may be one of the early factors in the origins of IDA.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Oh, absolutely. In fact, it was precisely the danger that they were seeing in&#13;
the case of India and Pakistan--the large borrowers--of creditworthiness. At least that&#13;
when IDA was, which was not favored but they realized they had to do it--in '67 or&#13;
'68, the Bank initiated what really was an excellent thing, I think, and this is why I say&#13;
it's more ironicalâ&#128;&#148;is this debt reporting system. They began to set it up country by&#13;
country, really standardize things through debt-holder data. What strikes me is that&#13;
they set up this system, worked with it, and the World Bank debt tables which you&#13;
now see, the sort of standard source for all data, started in '68, '69. What is surprising&#13;
to me is--I mean, that's the good part. The questionable part is that what--despite&#13;
having all this data (the debt crisis still caught them unawares) . . .&#13;
