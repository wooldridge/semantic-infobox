            Benchmarking regulators - making telecom
            regulators more effective in the Middle East
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Like telecommunications reformers
            elsewhere, Arab countries have set up independent regulatory
            authorities to make objective, consistent, and non-arbitrary
            regulatory decisions. This is a major step forward and is
            already delivering positive results for consumers in the
            form of new and better telecommunications services. Still,
            some governments seem reluctant to hand over the regulatory
            role, limiting the effectiveness of sector regulation and
            the agencies formed to implement it. One way forward is
            through benchmarking-to help policymakers and potential
            investors assess regulatory performance and prioritize
            efforts to strengthen it.
