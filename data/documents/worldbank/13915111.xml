Global Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is a WSP program focused on learning how to combine the&#13;
approaches of CLTS, behavior change communications, and social marketing of sanitation to&#13;
generate sanitation demand and strengthen the supply of sanitation products and services at&#13;
scale, leading to improved health for people in rural areas. It is a large-scale effort to meet the basic&#13;
sanitation needs of the rural poor who do not currently have access to safe and hygienic sanitation.&#13;
Local and national governments are implementing the program with technical support from WSP.&#13;

                        Rural Sanitation initiative, a cross-country impact evaluation (IE) study is being&#13;
                        conducted in India, Indonesia, and Tanzania. The World Bank's Water and Sani-&#13;
                        tation Program (WSP) Global Impact Evaluation Team in Washington, DC, leads&#13;
                        the study, with the contribution of WSP teams and consultants in each of the&#13;
                        participating countries. The baseline data collection for all countries was con-&#13;
                        ducted during 2008 and 2009, and the reports have undergone several peer re-&#13;
                        view processes.&#13;

                        The program Global IE Team oversees the IE design, methodology, and instruments,&#13;
                        and manages the country teams. It is led by Bertha Briceno (in its early stages the&#13;
                        Global IE was led by Jack Molyneaux), together with Alexandra Orsola&#13;
                        Vidal and Claire Chase. Professor Paul Gertler has provided guidance and advice&#13;
                        throughout the project. Global IE experts also include Sebastian Galiani, Jack Col-&#13;
                        ford, Ben Arnold, Pavani Ram, Lia Fernald, Patricia Kariger, Mark Sobsey, and&#13;
                        Christine Stauber. In India, the IE design, field activities, and data analysis are led by&#13;

In response to the preventable threats posed by poor sanita-      "shame and disgust" to move a community from defecating&#13;

launched the Global Scaling Up Handwashing (HWWS)                 "no human being can stay unmoved once they have learned&#13;
project and the Global Scaling Up Rural Sanitation program,       that they are ingesting other people's [waste]" (Kar and&#13;
two large-scale projects aimed at improving the health and        Chambers 2008). CLTS is proven to be effective at trigger-&#13;
welfare outcomes for millions of poor people. Local and na-       ing behavior changes to end open defecation and has spread&#13;
tional governments are implementing these projects with           rapidly, primarily among nongovernmental organizations&#13;
technical support from WSP.                                       implementing small-scale sanitation projects in South Asia.&#13;

The Global Scaling Up Rural Sanitation program, also              erally cannot bring about sustained long-term change in&#13;
known as the Total Sanitation and Sanitation Marketing            sanitation behaviors.&#13;

people in service of the much larger goal of developing evi-      Behavior Change Communications. To supplement the&#13;

            Scaling up rural sanitation : findings from
            the impact evaluation baseline survey in Madhya Pradesh, India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In India, Water and Sanitation
            Program's (WSP's) global scaling up rural
            sanitation program is supporting the Government of
            India's (GoI) Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) in two
            states: Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. TSC is an
            ambitious countrywide, scaled-up rural sanitation program
            launched by the GoI in 1999, which seeks to attain an Open
            Defecation Free (ODF) India by 2012. In contrast to earlier,
            hardware-centric supply approaches to rural sanitation, TSC
            aims to generate demand for and adoption of improved
            sanitation at the community level. The program focuses on
            creating ODF communities rather than bringing about
            incremental individual changes. The TSC aims not only to
            achieve ODF communities but also focuses on hygiene, waste
            management, and sanitation in schools and institutions. The
            main components of the intervention include: 1)
            community-led total sanitation, 2) social marketing of
            sanitation, 3) strengthening the enabling environment, and
            4) nirmal gram puraskar awards.  Although the data are
            limited in establishing causality, emerging trends indicate
            that gains in improved sanitation, likely to be brought
            about by TSC, could have positive impacts on the health and
            welfare of rural families, especially young children.
