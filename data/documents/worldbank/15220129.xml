&#13;
Benefit-cost ratios (economic return per currency unit invest-&#13;
ed) and annualized costs per household are compiled for the&#13;
four rural sites in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Among the various&#13;
sanitation options, the most favorable economic performance&#13;

                                                                     Beneï¬?t - Cost Ratios&#13;
was found for urine diverting dry toilets (UDDT), followed by&#13;
biogas digesters. These interventions have the highest bene-&#13;
fit-cost ratios of 9.0 and 7.6, respectively. The next ranked in-&#13;
terventions are private pit latrines and community toilets with&#13;
benefitâ&#128;&#148;cost ratios of 6.2 and 5.5, respectively. The lowest&#13;
ranked intervention but still with highly favorable economic&#13;
returnsâ&#128;&#148;is the septic tank option, with a benefit-cost ratio of&#13;
3.5. All interventions have an annual economic rate of return&#13;
of more than 100 percent, thus requiring less than one year&#13;
to recover the economic value of the initial investment costs.                                                                   Reuse&#13;

pit latrine, the annual equivalent cost per household, includ-               (2009 prices, using average exchange rate with US$)&#13;
ing O&amp;M is around US$30 per household. Almost half of this&#13;
value is O&amp;M costs. The annual equivalent cost for UDDT is&#13;
higher at US$50. However, this option is assumed to have&#13;
greater health benefits due to less environmental pollution;&#13;
and the value of reusing human excreta in home gardening&#13;
or cropland, thus reducing the need to purchase chemical&#13;
fertilizers. Septic tanks have a higher initial investment cost at&#13;
US$408, but are expected to last for 20 years.&#13;
                                                                     US$&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The findings suggest that low-cost technologies, particularly&#13;
improved pit latrines, are worth pursuing especially for low-in-&#13;
come groups. The most important benefits for all options are&#13;
time savings and health improvements, except community&#13;
toilets which have less time savings. For UDDT and commu-&#13;
nity toilets, the annual equivalent cost is repaid by the saved&#13;
health care costs alone.&#13;
&#13;
Under actual program conditions, there is an important de-                                     Investment       Maintenance            Operations&#13;

non-use of the facilities by some households or household&#13;
members, as they prefer to continue traditional practices                   latrines declines from an economic return per currency unit&#13;
such as open defecation or use of old unimproved latrines                   spent of 6.2 to 4.4, for UDDT from 9.0 to 5.8, for biogas from&#13;
instead of UDDT. For example, the benefit-cost ratio of pit                 7.6 to 4.9, and for septic tanks from 3.4 to 2.4.&#13;

  Community toilets also have a high economic return with a&#13;
  benefit-cost ratio of 4.4, followed by shared latrines (3.1),&#13;
  septic tank with septage management (2.7) and sewerage&#13;
  (1.9).&#13;
&#13;
  Private pit latrines have an initial investment cost of US$187&#13;

  US$43 (taking into account both investment and O&amp;M costs).&#13;

  the overall economic performance was lower than private pit&#13;
  latrines.&#13;
&#13;
  Sanitation options with improved excreta management had&#13;
  the lowest economic performance, shown in Figure 5. While&#13;
  septic tanks with septage management had an initial invest-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  longer lifespans (20 years) and their higher health benefits still&#13;
  make these interventions highly socially profitable. In addition,&#13;
  the environmental pollution averted due to proper septage&#13;
  management has not been fully valued in this study, hence it&#13;
  is possible that the economic returns, and benefit-cost ratio,&#13;
  are approaching those of lower cost options.&#13;
&#13;
  The findings suggest that low-cost technologies, particularly&#13;
  improved pit latrines, are worth pursuing, especially for low-                                 Investment        Maintenance           Operations&#13;

  building UDDT structures and reuse options, the septic tank                   management reduces from 2.7 to 2.0, sewerage from 1.9 to&#13;
  with septage treatment and sewerage with treatment are                        1.5, and pit latrines from 5.2 to 3.7. This is due not only to&#13;
  both economically attractive options.                                         non-use by some households or household members of the&#13;

  Under actual program conditions, there is also a significant                  at well below their engineered capacity.&#13;

            The Economics of Sanitation Initiative
            (ESI) is a multi-country study launched in 2007 as a
            response by the World Bank's Water and Sanitation
            Program to address major gaps in evidence among developing
            countries on the economic aspects of sanitation. Its
            objective is to provide economic evidence to increase the
            volumes and efficiency of public and private spending on
            sanitation. This research brief summarizes the key findings
            the study of second phase cost-benefit analysis of
            alternative sanitation options from Yunnan province. Surveys
            were conducted in four rural and four urban sites that have
            recently been the focus of intensified sanitation programs
            and projects, involving overall 909 household
            questionnaires, focus group discussions, physical
            investigations, water quality assessments, market surveys,
            and health facility surveys conducted in each site. Primary
            data were supplemented with data from other surveys.
            Economic efficiency of the improved sanitation can be
            optimized by making programs more demand-sensitive, which
            leads to sustained behavior change. More efforts are needed
            to stimulate demand from populations and deliver sanitation
            solutions that they wish for. Users should be involved in
            all the stages of sanitation projects.
