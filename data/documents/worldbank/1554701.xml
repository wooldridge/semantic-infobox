ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper reviews the existing data, mainly Chinese publications, on&#13;
childhood diseases in order to assess the health status and morbidity patterns&#13;
of Chinese children.&#13;
China's infant mortality rate is among the very lowest in the&#13;
developing world. The number of post-neonatal deaths as a proportion of total&#13;
infant death has decreased to a level comparable to that of a developed&#13;
country. The epidemiologic pattern of vaccine preventable diseases indicates&#13;
that immunization activities have had a significant impact on the occurrence&#13;
of these diseases. The overall prevalence of infectious diseases is&#13;
decreasing and, relatively, the frequency of congenital defects is increasing&#13;
as a major cause of childhood mortality. However, fecal-borne diseases such&#13;
as dysentery, hepatitis, and ascariasis are still the predominant causes of&#13;
morbidity. A secular improvement in the nutritional status of Chinese&#13;
children is noted, but mild to moderate malnutrition still persists.&#13;
This review sets out a series of issues: the impact of the one-child&#13;
family policy, which is creating different demands on the maternal and child&#13;
health care service network; technological shortcomings in immunization&#13;
activities, which are affecting coverage; the lack of better technical&#13;
training, which is influencing health reporting and surveillance systems; and&#13;
the lack of corrective programs to further decrease malnutrition.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
In China, one-third of the population is under 14 years old, i.e.&#13;
338.7 million people. The crude birth rate was highest in the mid-1950s, when&#13;
it reached 45 per 1,000 population. Since then, the birth rate has declined&#13;
to about 20 per 1,000 in 1982. According to the 1982 census, more than 20.7&#13;
million births occurred in 1981. The proportion of children in the total&#13;
populati?7 in the 1982 census was lower than that in the 1953 and 1964&#13;
census. -   This is in part a result of family planning and population&#13;
control. At the same time, health policies have supported the improvement of&#13;
environmental health standards and the provision of more adequate maternal and&#13;
child health care in the community. These measures contributed to the decline&#13;
in child mortality, particularly infant mortality. As the rate of child&#13;
survival improves, the birth rate decreases. In China today, every child is a&#13;
wanted child.&#13;
Many visitors to China, especially those familiar with other&#13;
developing countries, are surprised by the apparent good health of Chinese&#13;
children. There is no acute malnutrition. Those children seen on the streets&#13;
radiate cheerfulness and vitality. However, quantitative data, such as&#13;
nationwide age-specific morbidity and mortality statistics for children in&#13;
China, are scarce and difficult to obtain. Annex Table 1 presents an urban&#13;
and rural comparison of age-specific mortality rates for 1957 and 1975. Death&#13;
rates declined between 1957 and 1975 for every age group, most drastically for&#13;
infant mortality. The rural infant mortality is about twice that of urban.&#13;
Based on a two-year (1974-1976) review of infant mortality in 12 provinc 1q and&#13;
cities, the rural infant mortality rate was 2 to 4 times that of urban. -&#13;
The magnitude of the urban/rural difference in the age groups between 1 and 10&#13;
years is smaller; it varied between a factor of 1 and 2. The urban/rural&#13;
difference in 1957 was greater than in 1975. Annex Table 2 and Annex Map 1&#13;
present the crude birth rate by province in 1982 based on the 10 percent&#13;
sampling of the 1982 census. The percentage of infant deaths varied from 27&#13;
percent in Ningxia to 4 percent in Shanghai. Population age distribution data&#13;
by province were not available to calculate the age-specific mortality rate.&#13;
An alternative is to use an adjusted age-specific mortality rate. However,&#13;
using a standard population, in this case, does not provide a better&#13;
comparison because of the difference in population age distribution among the&#13;
provinces. The Chinese population policy for minorities is different from its&#13;
overall policy: minorities are exempted from policies on population&#13;

year review (1974-1976) of infant mortality in 12 provinces and cities&#13;
conducted by the Child Health Care Department, Institute of Pediatrics,&#13;
Chinese Academy of Medical Science; data, however, were not presented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

control. Ningxia, with a large minority population (54 percent are Hui), has&#13;
a higher birth rate, and its population age distribution is different from&#13;
other provinces, that is, it is younger. Thus, in addition to urban and rural&#13;
differences within provinces, there is a regional difference in the mortality&#13;
rate for both infants and children of age 1 to 10. The proportion of deaths&#13;
for infants and children in Guizhou of the southwest region, and in Gansu and&#13;
Ningxia of the northwest region are higher than that of other provinces.&#13;
The major factors responsible for improvement in the health status of&#13;
children in China should be attributed to the government's emphasis on&#13;
prevention, on community mobilization in the organization of mass campaigns,&#13;
on the improvement of environment sanitation, on the improvement of nutrition,&#13;
and on organization of the basic network of maternal and child health care&#13;
centers and personnel at each level, from province to brigade level.&#13;
This paper reviews the existing literature on childhood diseases in&#13;
order to assess the health status and morbidity pattern of Chinese children,&#13;
and to discuss issues relating to their health care needs. Section II&#13;
describes perinatal health, focusing on maternal and infant morbidity.&#13;
Section III reviews the most prevalent childhood communicable diseases.&#13;
Section IV presents available anthropometric surveys and micronutrient&#13;
diseases. Section V describes other childhood diseases, such as parasitic and&#13;
endemic diseases. Section VI describes the existing network of maternal and&#13;
child health care services, and section VII sets out a series of relevant&#13;
issues.&#13;

II. PERINATAL HEALTH&#13;
A. Maternal Mortality&#13;
The maternal mortality rate is defined as the number of women who die&#13;
as a result of child bearing in a given year per 100,000 births. Maternal&#13;
deaths are those caused by complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Before&#13;
liberation, the average maternal mortality rate in China was 3eported to be as&#13;
high as 150 per 10,000 live births (range 32 to 171). Wray - cites an&#13;
estimate that in preliberation North China, 2 to 3 percent of all women going&#13;
into labor died of complications due to pelvic deformity from osteomalacia.&#13;
In 1982, the reported national figure was 5 per 10,000 live births.&#13;
The mortality rate has drastically declined over the last 30 years. However,&#13;
urban and rural differences still exist, as shown in Table 1. The figures for&#13;

Bank health project; there were 10 counties from Heilongjiang, 15 counties&#13;
from Shangdong, 16 counties from Sichuan, and 5 counties from Ningxia.&#13;
3/ Wray, J.D., "Child Care in the People's Republic of China - 1973: Part&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
rural areas were calculated from data on 46 counties in 4 provinces&#13;
(Shangdong, Heilongjiang, Sichuan and Ningxia) participating in the first&#13;
World Rank health project. Regional differences in the mortality rate may be&#13;
related to differences in the availability of health resources and cultural&#13;
practices. Mortality in Ningxia was about 70 percent higher than the national&#13;
average.&#13;
The main causes of maternal deaths, as reported from a Shanghai&#13;
hospital, but not in ranking order, were:   eclamp 0a, ruptured uterus,&#13;
pulmonary embolism, and amniotic fluid embolism. -    This pattern is similar&#13;
to other developed countries. Before liberation, postpartum fever,&#13;
hemorrhage, and eclampsia were the major causes of maternal deaths.&#13;
Postpartum fever is still a major cause of morbidity. Hemorrhage and&#13;
infection are no longer the leading causes of death, which indicates that&#13;
better standards of care are available, and a substantial proportion of&#13;
"avoidable" deaths have been prevented.&#13;
Perinatal mortality includes stillbirth from 28 weeks gestation and&#13;
death of a live infant (of any gestation) up to one week after birth. Annex&#13;
Table 3 provides information from selected sou qes in 17 provinces and cities&#13;
between 1953 and 1979-on perinatal mortality. -    The perinatal mortality rate&#13;
varies among provinces. The average perinatal mortality was 20.48 per 1,000&#13;
live births (range 13.12 to 20.48). Within each province or city the rate&#13;
also varies, which may be due to differences in reporting, differences in&#13;
ascertainment of births and deaths, and bias in sample selection (see Table&#13;
2). The actual perinatal mortality rate is most likely higher, since these&#13;
data were collected from major cities or provincial hospitals rather than from&#13;
the entire province, including both rural and urban areas. There is also a&#13;
difference in the reporting of deaths. In Shanghai data, abortions in late&#13;
pregnancy (i.e. third trimester) and neonatal deaths within 7 days of birth&#13;
occurring outside the hospital were not included in the nominator.&#13;
The major causes of perinatal mortality were prematurity, difficult&#13;
labor, eclampsia, congenital defects, and asphyxia. Clinicopathological&#13;
correlation with autopsy of perinatal deaths showed that the causes of death&#13;
were: first, respiratory (hemorrhage, hyaline membrane disease); second,&#13;
asphyxia; and third, congenital malformation. Comparison with several&#13;
countries is presented in Table 3.&#13;
4/  Chalmers, I.  "Better Perinatal Health - Shanghai," The Lancet, No. 1&#13;
(1980): 138.&#13;
5/ Much information was lost as a result of the way the data was presented.&#13;
The total number of perinatal deaths were reported by different time&#13;
periods instead of by year. For instance, Nanjing Hospital reported a&#13;
total number of 541 perinatal deaths from 1953 to 1978. Thus, the pattern&#13;
of changes over the last 20 years is not obvious. Even so, the data do&#13;
show that perinatal mortality varies among provinces.&#13;

B. Infant Mortality&#13;
The infant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of infant deaths under&#13;
1 year of age per 1,000 live births in a given year. The IMR has declined&#13;
from 200 per 1,000 live births in 1949 to 53 per 1,000 live births in 1980.&#13;
The pattern of decline is similar between the Beijing data and nationwide&#13;
data, but the nationwide data indicated a drastic increase in the period 1960&#13;
to 1961. Major agricultural failure occurred during this period, in part due&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6-&#13;
to two successive years of bad weather, and in part due to economic&#13;
mismanagement associated with the Great Leap Forward. Beijing, being the&#13;
capital city, probably was less seriously affected by the famine and&#13;
agricultural failure.&#13;
Figures from Beijing from earlier years (1926-1934) are given in&#13;
Table 4. These figures are not representative of rural China or of Chinese&#13;
cities. The data was collected from the First Health Special Area established&#13;
in 1926 in a northeastern section of Peking and covering a population of&#13;
55,000. The relatively high sex ratio for several years may reflect&#13;
underreporting of female infanticides. One feature of infant mortality in old&#13;
China was the predominance of female over male deaths.&#13;
More recent infant mortality rates from various sources are also&#13;
presented in Table 4; Figure 1 shows the trend over the last 30 years. The&#13;
decline has been drastic; the reported IMR in China today has reached levels&#13;
much lower than that of countries of comparable per capita gross national&#13;
product. The official national estimate was 20.3 per 1,000 live births in&#13;
1982.&#13;
The World Bank estimates of infant mortality rates are higher than&#13;
the official figures. In order to fit the available data on age-specific&#13;
mortality rates from China, the Bank used a modified "West" model life table&#13;
which applies a different "West" mortality level for different age groups.&#13;
This resulted in a higher infant mortality rate for given life expectancy than&#13;
the unmodified "West" models. The official figures were obtained from&#13;
reporting of selected urban and rural areas (which by no means are&#13;
representative for China as a whole). Underreporting and the extent of&#13;
underreporting vary from place to place, depending on the quality of the&#13;
existing reporting system. Infant deaths might be reported as stillbirths and&#13;
vice versa, or might not be reported at all. Infanticides may be reported as&#13;
stillbirths. A verification survey of infant deaths was conducted in&#13;
Chongqing coygty, Sichuan in 1981, and 33 percent of infant deaths were&#13;
unreported. VI  bother survey in Jingan County, Shanghai, found 5 percent&#13;
underreporting. _&#13;
Age-specific death rates have declined for all ages, but the IMR&#13;
still accounts for 50 percent of deaths for children less than 14 years of&#13;
age. The major causes of deaths in Old China were diarrhea, malnutrition,&#13;
tetanus, and birth injury. Today, infectious etiology is contributing to&#13;
fewer deaths. Congenital defects, premature birth, and birth injury are&#13;
taking up a greater share in the cause of deaths (see Table 5). In the urban&#13;
areas, about 80 percent of infant deaths are due to pneumonia, congenital&#13;

defects, premature birth, and birth injury. The incidence of tetanus has&#13;
declined to negligible levels in the cities. In the rural areas, tetanus and&#13;
pneumonia still account for about 40 percent of infant deaths. In Ningxia,&#13;
the neonatal tetanus mortality rate was as high as 51 per 100,000 live births&#13;
in some counties.&#13;
The factors underlying improvement in infant health are complex.&#13;
Aside from a general rise in living standards and better sanitary conditions,&#13;
progress in prenatal, intrapartum, and neonatal care also contribute&#13;
significantly to improved pregnancy outcome and reduced neonatal mortality.&#13;
C. Neonatal Mortality&#13;
It is important to note that the neonatal mortality rate, that is,&#13;
deaths in the first 28 days of life per 1,000 live births, is now about 50 to&#13;
70 percent of infant deaths (see Annex Table 4). This is the pattern seen in&#13;
industrialized countries where most infant deaths occur in the first month of&#13;
life. The mortality rate secondary to diseases of newborns from 28 rural&#13;
surveillance points was 6.26 per 100,000 population; it ranks 11th in the&#13;
total causes of death for all ages, and accounts for 1 percent of total deaths&#13;
for all age groups. 8/ In 1949, the neonatal mortality rate ranged between&#13;
56.5 to 188.0 per 1,000 live births. The major causes of death were&#13;
congenital syphilis (26 percent) and neonatal tetanus (5 percent). The causes&#13;
of neonatal mortality today are prematurity (26 percent), asphyxia (22&#13;
percent), congenital malformation (13 percent), and infections (14 percent).&#13;
8/ Data from Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Chinese Academy of&#13;
Medical Sciences.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
This pattern is similar to developed countries, whereas in many developing&#13;
countries of China's level of economic development, malnutrition and infection&#13;
are still the predominant causes of infant death.&#13;
Although published neonatal data from China are limited, those that&#13;
exist report a low incidence of low birth-weight (LBW) births. China's&#13;
incidence of low birthweight is lower when compared to other developed and&#13;
developing countries (see Table 6). Its incidence of LBW was about 6 percent&#13;
in 1981.. The incidence of low birth weights reported by the International&#13;
Peace Maternity Hospital, Shanghai, was 4.7 percent, compared with an overall&#13;
rate of 6.8 percent in the United States (5.7 percent for whites, 12.5 percent&#13;
for blacks in 1982). This low incidence may be due to underreporting of the&#13;
births of very small babies and sampling bias (that is, hospital data&#13;
underrepresent the population).   But se ral factors give evidence of internal&#13;
consistency within the data. Chalmers - compared some risk factors of low&#13;
birth weight at the maternal hospital in Shanghai and Cardiff (Wales), and the&#13;
prevalence rate of these risk factors was generally lower in Shanghai. The&#13;
rate of multiple pregnancy is 7.2 per 1,000 in Shanghai, with 11.1 per 1,000&#13;
in Cardiff; the incidence of hypertensive disorder is 12 per 1,000 women in&#13;
Shanghai and 45 per 1,000 women in Cardiff; the prevalence of congenital&#13;
malformation is lower in Shanghai than in Cardiff (see Annex Table 5). In&#13;
addition, teenage pregnancies and smoking are rare among Chinese women.&#13;

It is possible that genetic influence plays a role in the favorable&#13;
distribution of birthweight. A vital statistics report from the U.S. National&#13;
9/ Chalmers, I. "Better Perinatal Health-Shanghai," The Lancet, No. 1 (1980):&#13;
137-39.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Center of Health Statistics, 1982, reported that 4.9 percent of Chinese babies&#13;
born in the U.S. weighed less than NO0    grams, whereas the incidence of LBW&#13;
is 5.7 percent among white babies.       The differential in the low birth&#13;
weight between these races was the same when controlled for the duration of&#13;
mother's education. Another possible explanation may relate to certain&#13;
traditional Chinese values and living habits that might be conducive to&#13;
favorable fetal and perinatal development. The incidence of LBW is a powerful&#13;
determinant of mortality risk in fetal, neonatal, and postneonatal life. The&#13;
apparent low incidence of LBW deserves a closer investigation. Comparison of&#13;
national statistics could provide a better understanding of nationwide&#13;
variation in the incidence of LBW. If the incidence is consistently low,&#13;
further research could be carried out to analyze possible contributing factors&#13;
to the low incidence.&#13;
D. Diseases of Infancy&#13;
As discussed in the previous section, at least 50 percent of infant&#13;
deaths occur during the neonatal period. The prevalence of morbidity among&#13;
neonates is 30 percent. Low birth weight neonates have a high morbidity rate;&#13;
the incidence is 50 percent, versus 29 percent in neonates of birth weight&#13;
over 2,500 gm. The frequency of the morbidity pattern is as follows:&#13;
communicable diseases, 30 percent; birth injury, 14 percent; congenital&#13;
defects, 8 percent; hematologic diseases, 6 percent; respiratory diseases, 5&#13;
percent; digestive diseases, 4 percent; and others (such as apnea, diarrhea&#13;
and dehydration, hydrocephalus, heart failure, craniotabes, etc.), account for&#13;
33 percent. Neonatal tetanus and congenital defects will be discussed in this&#13;
section.&#13;
Neonatal Tetanus&#13;
The World Health Organization estimates that neonatal tetanus is&#13;
responsible for 90 percent of the 1 million annual deaths related to tetanus&#13;
in the world. Before liberation, neonatal tetanus was one of the causes of&#13;
infant death; about 5 percent of neonatal deaths were due to tetanus. The&#13;
incidence of death from neonatal tetanus has drastically declined over the&#13;
last 30 years. The average incidence was 6 per 10,000 births in 1982 for the&#13;
46 above mentioned counties in 4 provinces (Heilongjiang, Shangdong, Sichuan,&#13;
and Ningxia), with a range from 0 to 51.&#13;
Tetanus bacterial spores are common in soil, especially when manure&#13;
is used as a fertilizer, a common practice in China. Thus, there is no hope&#13;
of eliminating the reservoir of infection. Even with accessible health&#13;
services, the disease has a case fatality ranging from 40 to 90 percent in&#13;
China.&#13;

The disease is preventable at low cost with cord hygiene and maternal&#13;
vaccination during pregnancy. A major contributing factor to the reduction of&#13;
neonatal tetanus mortality may be the increased availability of maternal and&#13;
child health services. Between 1949 and 1952, the national total of maternal&#13;
and child health stations and centers increased from 9 to 2,379. The number&#13;
of registered midwives increased from 13,900 in 1969 to 73,305 in 1982. In&#13;
addition, there are 549,659 part-time midwives, and about 1 midwife per 1,600&#13;
population (or 6 midwives per 10,000 population). MCH services are accessible&#13;
at every level, and at least 90 percent of deliveries are conducted with the&#13;
"scientific method" of using sterile tools (see Table 7).&#13;

Congenital Defects&#13;
Congenital mal ormation among infants has been estimated as high as&#13;
20 per 1,000 births.  -   The overall prevalence based on Shanghai hospital&#13;
data was 6.4 per 1,000 live births. As the prevalence of communicable&#13;
diseases gradually declines, the relative prevalence of hereditary disorders&#13;
increases. In the U.S., approximately 30 percent of children in hospitals are&#13;
there because of genetically determined or influenced disorders. Data from&#13;
Beijing also shows similar proportions. About 20 percent of total deaths for&#13;
infants were due to congenital defects in 1979. During 1974-1976, 30 percent&#13;
of death causes for chil ren aged less than 15 were due to congenital or&#13;
hereditary disorders. 1     A comparison of hospital admissions between 1963&#13;
and 1978 in Shanghai illustrated that increasing proportions of admissions&#13;
were due to genetic disorders or congenital malformations compared to&#13;
infections and general pediatric ailments (see Table 8).&#13;

child want reassurance that their child will be healthy. Although Article 6&#13;
of the 1980 Marriage Law specifically prohibits marriage among persons who are&#13;
direct blood relations or collateral relatives within three generations,&#13;
marriages among relatives are still prevalent among the minority population&#13;
and people in the geographically distant areas. A survey of the percentages&#13;
and types of consanguineous marriage in the Hans and 10 national minorities&#13;
was carried out from May 1980 to January 1981. Marriage was considered to be&#13;
consanguineous when husband and wife have a common ancestor within five&#13;
generations. The percentages of consanguineous marriages were: 1 percent for&#13;
Hans in Beijing and Hubei, 14 percent for Yi minority in Sichuan and Gansu,&#13;
10 percent for the Hui minority in Gansu, 3 percent for the Dongyang minority&#13;
in Gansu, 3 percent for the Ewenki minority in Inner Mongolia, 2 percent for&#13;
the Eroqen minority in Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, 1 percent for the Li&#13;
minority and 1 percent for the Miao minority on Hainan Islands, a4n 0 percent&#13;
for both the Korean and Tibetan minorities in Jilin and Xizang. -     It is&#13;
estimated that 3 to 9 percent of infants born to couples who are first cousins&#13;
are affected by hereditary disease, compared tol?7e-tenth of a percent among&#13;
offsprings of marriages of nonrelated persons. -     Health education and&#13;
marriage policies play an important role in preventing the 'avoidable' factor&#13;
which increases the risk of congenital defects. However, restrictions in&#13;
urban and rural population mobility may inadvently result in higher frequency&#13;
of inter-marriage in a village with the same family name for populations&#13;
residing in very remote areas.&#13;
Genetic services, such as prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis with&#13;
biochemical or karyotype analysis of fetal cells or amniotic fluid, are the&#13;
best available strategies for most genetic disorders, which are now under&#13;
great demand in the counties and provincial health facilities. Many county&#13;
level MCH centers are attempting to set up genetic screening.&#13;

After liberation, the government carried out an extensive program to&#13;
eradicate venereal disease. This program included the closing down of&#13;
prostitute houses, prohibition of prostitution, establishment of prevention&#13;
and treatment centers, organization of medical personnel for venereal disease&#13;
eradication, mass screening, and active treatment with special emphasis on&#13;
syphilis in pregnant women. As a result, venereal disease was eradicated.&#13;
Statistics from the Peking Medical College show that the incidence of&#13;
congenital syphilis dropped from 10 percent in 1949 to 0.7 percent in 1955.&#13;

purulent conjunctivitis occurring in infants within the first 3 weeks of birth&#13;
and associated with maternal gonorrhea infections, has not been reported.&#13;
Topical prophylaxis with solutions such as silver nitrate applied immediately&#13;
postpartum is an effective preventive measure which should be continued, even&#13;
though venereal disease has been eradicated. The increased influx of&#13;
travellers to China in recent years will inevitably reintroduce sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases.&#13;

III. CHILD HEALTH&#13;
In relation to other age groups, mortality rates for children are&#13;
very low.  The rate for children aged 1 to 3 is one-half that for infants, and&#13;
the rate for children aged 3 to 7 is one-tenth that for infants. About 50&#13;
percent of the deaths among children aged 1 to 4 were due to cancer,&#13;
respiratory diseases, and congenital defects mainly of nervous system (see&#13;
Table 10). Malnutrition was still among the 7 leading causes of death for&#13;
infants under age 1 and children aged 1 to 4. The leading causes of death for&#13;
urban children 1 to 4 years of age is becoming similar to the pattern in the&#13;
United States. In the U.S., accidents, cancer, congenital anomalies, and&#13;
pneumonia are the 4 major causes of deaths.&#13;

The pattern of childhood morbidity resembles that of other developing&#13;
countries. The most frequent illnesses for children less than 10 are&#13;
respiratory diseases, acute gastroenteritis, external injuries and skin&#13;
diseases. Table 11 shows the morbidity pattern for children in Qufu County,&#13;

A. Acute Gastroenteritis&#13;
Acute gastroenteritis is a group of clinical enterities, mainly of&#13;
infectious origin, consisting of dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers,&#13;
cholera, infantile diarrhea, food poisoning, and indigestive diarrhea.&#13;
Reporting is based largely on clinical criteria. Bacterial culture or stool&#13;
microscopic examination are seldom made at the commune and brigade level.&#13;
Among the 24 notifiable diseases, dysentery ranks second, after&#13;
influenza. Of all diarrheal deseases, dysentery heads the list of reported&#13;
cases. Bacillary dysentery implies shigellosis. Shigella flexneri, followed&#13;
by Shigella sonnei, are the predominant isolates. Shigella infection is most&#13;
frequent in preschool children but may occur at any age. It is considered by&#13;
the Ministry of Public Health to be China's most serious diarrheal disease&#13;
problem. June, July, August, and September are the months of highest&#13;
incidence.&#13;
Based on hospital admissions for diarrheal diseases at Shanghai First&#13;
Medical College, dysentery is an overwhelming childhood disease; 65 percent of&#13;
admissions of children below 2 years of age were due to dysentery. About 90&#13;
percent of pediatric outpatient visits with acute gastroenteritis were&#13;
diagnosed as dysentery. This may be a selection bias. Only patients with&#13;
severe symptoms are taken to hospitals. The incidence of dysentery has not&#13;
reduced drastically over the last 30 years. In 1935, the dysentery-specific&#13;
death rate in Tingxien, a district southwest of Beijing, was 250 per&#13;
100,000. The reported incidence rate from 1939-44 in 19 provinces was 25.9&#13;
per 100,000. In 1981, the national incidence was 349 per 100,000. However,&#13;
underreporting in the earlier years may be the main reason for the continuing&#13;
high incidence rate over the recent years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Similarly, the reported incidence of acute gastroenteritis for&#13;
Shanghai in 1979 was 1,000 per 100,000, and Guandong was 264 per 100,000; this&#13;
is one-fourth the rate of Shanghai. The differences reflect the relative&#13;
completeness of reporting in Shanghai rather than an actual lower incidence in&#13;
Guangdong (Annex Table 6).&#13;
A diarrhea morbidity and mortality survey on 5,789 households was&#13;
conducted in Shanxi province in 1982. Of the 2,527 children less than 5 years&#13;
old, 45 percent developed a new episode of diarrhea during the prior 2-week&#13;
period. If based on the assumption that the surveys were representative of&#13;
the entire year, the annual diarrhea incidence in children under 5 years of&#13;
age would be 1.2 episodes per child per year. This most likely is an&#13;
underrepresentation due to sampling bias and selection of populations. The&#13;
incidence is lower than the mean annual incjt,nce of the U.S., which was 1.9&#13;
in the under-5-year olds (Tecumseh study). -&#13;
A number of viral pathogens, such as rotavirus and parvovirus-like&#13;
agents, are associated with clinical symptoms in children below the age 5.&#13;
Dehydration is a typical feature of these illnesses. Very few studies have&#13;
estimated the incidence of diarrhea associated with rotavirus or parvo-like&#13;
agents due to lack of diagnostic tools in general clinical settings. In&#13;
developed countries, close to 50 percent of children aged 1-3 years who are&#13;
hospitalized for severe diarrhea are infected with rotavirus; a similar&#13;
frequency of rotavirus in severg dehydrating diarrhea has been found in&#13;
several developing countries. 1 /&#13;
The incidence of cholera has decreased to 0.008 per 100,000 in 1981,&#13;
and the cases are mainly imported, which means they occur along the southern&#13;
border of China, such as Guandong and Fujian Provinces. The incidence of&#13;
typhoid and paratyphoid was 7.6 per 100,000 in 1981. It has increased between&#13;
1974 and 1981. This increase, however, is due to improvement of the reporting&#13;
system rather than actual higher incidence. Highest attack rates occur to the&#13;
age group of 5 to 19. There is no data available on the prevalence of&#13;
Amoebiasis, a severe parasitic dysentery. Annex Table 4 presents the&#13;
incidence of cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis by province in 1981.&#13;
B. Acute Respiratory Infections&#13;
The pathogens involved are multiple, such as the respiratory&#13;
syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses,&#13;
adenoviruses, and also measles, which produces respiratory manifestations as&#13;
one component of a more generalized disease. A serological survey in Beijing&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
on children under 14 showed that parainfluenza type I and III are the moa&#13;
common, followed by influenza type A, then respiratory syncytial virus.&#13;
It is not possible to determine etiology on clinical grounds; the&#13;
illnesses are usually enumerated simply as common colds. The distribution of&#13;
these illnesses is highest in younger children and decreases with increasing&#13;
age.&#13;
Respiratory syncytial virus is considered the most important agent of&#13;
respiratory infection among infants and young children because of its capacity&#13;
to cause life-threatening bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Major outbreaks occur&#13;
in the winter of alternate years; then in the next year, a smaller outbreak&#13;
takes place in the spring. Reinfection with the virus throughout life is&#13;
common. About 30 percent of a sample of children under 14 in Beijing had&#13;
antibodies to respiratory syncytial virus.&#13;
Acute respiratory infections rank second as a cause of outpatient&#13;
visits in brigade health stations. The prevalence of acute respiratory&#13;
infections including pneumonia among children was 7 to 8 percent in&#13;
Heilongjiang and Sichuan Province. Pneumonia, either viral or bacterial, is&#13;
still a major cause of morbidity and mortality for infants and children.&#13;
Respiratory diseases account for one-third to one-fourth of all causes of&#13;
illness in neonates. The fatality rate of neonatal pneumonia can be as high&#13;
as 20 percent.&#13;
C. Vaccine-Preventable Diseases&#13;
Immunization is one of the major contributing factors to China's&#13;
remarkable improvement in the health condition of its population. Since&#13;
liberation, a basic network for child health care was built up, and since the&#13;
1960s mass immunization campaigns for childhood diseases have been established&#13;
and become routinely implemented. Five vaccines are administered to all&#13;
children: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) against tuberculosis, oral polio-&#13;
myelitis vaccine, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids combined with pertussis&#13;
(DPT), and live attenuated measles vaccine. Vaccines are administered by&#13;
Barefoot Doctors and MCH services. The present schedule for routine&#13;
immunization campaigns is shown in Annex Table 7. A modified schedule is&#13;
progressively introduced with the implementation of the WHO sponsored Expanded&#13;
Programme of Immunization (EPI). The impact of this activity is evident, as&#13;
the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases have decreased remarkably in&#13;
both urban and rural areas.&#13;
Vaccinations are given in organized campaigns because of lack of&#13;
adequate cold chain resources in rural areas. Thus, vaccinations are given&#13;
once a year for each type of vaccine, during campaigns of one to several days,&#13;
organized at the county level. The dates for vaccination are arranged in&#13;

advance. Barefoot doctors notify the eligible children (that is, children who&#13;
have attained the recommended age). Annex Table 8 indicates the number of&#13;
children eligible and percentage coverage. Immunization coverage rates were&#13;
well in excess of 90 percent for all the vaccines given. In the following&#13;
sections we will discuss verification surveys for some of the diseases in an&#13;
attempt to review the efficacy of the vaccination program.&#13;
Table 12 gives nationwide incidence rates for the childhood&#13;
communicable disease during 1974-1981, and Annex Table 9 gives incidences for&#13;
East District in Beijing from 1958 to 1979. Both sets of data indicate that&#13;
the incidence for childhood communicable diseases have decreased over the&#13;
years. The reported rates are lower in the cities than in the rural areas, but&#13;
there is a significant degree of underreporting, the extent of which varies by&#13;
disease between urban and rural areas.&#13;

A recent survey was carried out to assess the validity of the&#13;
reporting system in several urban and rural surveillance points (Annex&#13;
table 10). The comparison between reported cases versus discovered cases&#13;
(retrospective survey based on household visits) seems to indicate that the&#13;
accuracy and the reliability of reporting is greater in rural areas. Differ-&#13;
ences are significant for hepatitis, but also for measles. It is surprising&#13;
that reporting is less complete in urban areas, but it may be because the&#13;
clinical symptoms are less severe in urban children, who have better&#13;
nutritional status; hence, less frequent complications and less frequent&#13;
health care services are sought.&#13;

Incidence of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases&#13;
Measles&#13;
Measles is a highly contagious disease, which 90 percent of the&#13;
unprotected population aged under 5 years contract in many countries. Poor&#13;
nutritional status seems to be the main factor leading to the most severe&#13;
consequences of measles. Death is caused by pneumonia, diarrhea or, in a&#13;
small number of cases, encephalitis in association with the disease. Maternal&#13;
antibodies transferred through the placenta protect the infant during the&#13;
first months of life. If measles vaccine is given to the infant before nine&#13;
months of age, these antibodies may prevent the vaccine from producing&#13;
immunity in the child.&#13;
Before the mass vaccination in China in 1965, epidemics of measles&#13;
occurred in alternate years. During the epidemic years, the annual incidence&#13;
was as high as 1,000 to 5,000 cases per 100,000 population, with a case&#13;
fatality rate of 1 to 2 percent.&#13;
In 1965, when an attenuated measles vaccine was developed in China, a&#13;
vaccination campaign was launched throughout the country. In its early years,&#13;
the immunization program was not implemented simultaneously at all places, and&#13;
outbreaks continued to occur; however, the incidence of measles declined in&#13;
some areas. Since the late 1970s, the coverage of vaccination of children&#13;
younger than 7 years of age has increased to over 90 percent. The incidence&#13;
had dropped to below 20 per 100,000 for major cities by 1980 (see Annex table&#13;
9 for East Beijing). Nationally, the incidence was about 200 per 100,000 in&#13;
1981, and the fatality-rate has decreased to less than 0.1 percent (Table&#13;
12). Figure 2 shows the decrease in the incidence of measles before and after&#13;
vaccination. However, measles still account for an appreciable proportion of&#13;
all cases of infectious disease.&#13;
The epidemiologic characteristics of measles have changed&#13;
substantially with widespread vaccination campaigns. The age-specific&#13;
incidence of measles has shifted to older age groups. In the prevaccine era,&#13;
the incidence was highest among preschool children, especially those up to 4&#13;
years of age.  More than 95 percent of children had measles by the age of 6.&#13;
After mass vaccination, the number of wsles cases in older age groups (5-14)&#13;
represents two-thirds of total cases. -      This shift is due to an increasing&#13;
proportion of young children being protected by immunization.&#13;
Before the vaccine era, the incidence of measles generally peaked in&#13;
February and March, and fell in the winter or late spring. A change in this&#13;
pattern has been observed in many places since the vaccination campaign was&#13;
launched. The peak incidence occurs later in the year, shifting toward spring&#13;
and summer. (See Figure 3.)&#13;

The epidemic pattern of measles is dependent upon the proper use of&#13;
measles vaccine. If a high-quality vaccine is used, and if both vaccination&#13;
coverage and the rate of successful vaccination are high, there should be no&#13;
epidemic at all. Table 13 presents data which shows that the incidence of&#13;
measles decreases as percentage coverage by vaccination increases. A&#13;
seroepidemiologic sryrey was conducted in Mengcun county, Hehei Province, of&#13;
130,000 population -   in 1978 after a measles outbreak.   The outbreak&#13;
occurred after the introduction of measles cases from outside the county,&#13;
which propagated to a total of 116 cases in the county. An investigation of&#13;
the immunization history of these cases showed that 49 percent (57 cases) were&#13;
not vaccinated, and 51 percent (59 cases) received vaccination, of which 16&#13;
cases had received measles vaccine at age less than 1. Six cases had received&#13;
measles vaccination twice.&#13;

The problems are in the quality of vaccine, in the cold chain and the&#13;
timing of vaccination.   Freeze-dried vaccine is not yet available in China,&#13;
and the liquid form currently used has a short period of potency. Patients&#13;
who were vaccinated but failed to elicit an immune response may have received&#13;
a vaccine that had lost its potency. Since vaccines need to be stored between&#13;
40C to 80C during transport, lack of knowledge about vaccine storage or lack&#13;
of equipment for proper storage contribute to the ineffectiveness of a&#13;
vaccine. In Gansu, the health officials reported that 85 percent of measles&#13;
vaccines have lost effectiveness by the time of vaccination. In certain areas&#13;
in China, the measles vaccination schedule are set for infants to receive the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
vaccine after 8 months of age. The optimal age for vaccination has been&#13;
extensively researched. In developing countries, the risk of exposure to the&#13;
infection at an earlier age versus the risk of failing to elicit an immune&#13;
response when the vaccine is given too early (when maternal immunoglobulin is&#13;
still present) in addition to the immature immune system, must be weighed in&#13;
order to decide an optimal age for the vaccination. The consensus, therefore,&#13;
is to administer measles vaccination after one year of age.&#13;
Pertussis&#13;
Pertussis is second to measles as a cause of morbidity and mortality&#13;
among vaccine-preventable diseases in some developing countries and also in&#13;
China. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 80 percent of&#13;
unimmunized children will contract it. Pertussis, an acute bacterial&#13;
infection affecting the respiratory tract, is very contagious in the first&#13;
week or two of infection. The spasmodic coughing that characterizes the&#13;
disease lasts one to two months. In very young children there is no&#13;
characteristic whoop, so the disease may be difficult to recognize.&#13;
Immunization requires three vaccinations which may begin as early as 2 months&#13;
of age.&#13;
The incidence of pertussis in China has gradually declined. The&#13;
incidence was about 30 per 100,000 population in 1981 nationwide, which is an&#13;
underestimate. A verification survey indicated that underreporting is impor-&#13;
tant in several urban areas (see Annex Table 10).&#13;
Poliomyelitis&#13;
Poliomyelitis is a viral disease spread by contact with objects, food&#13;
or water contaminated with excreta. Poliomyelitis infection is universal, but&#13;
most persons have no symptoms. The older the child at the age of infection,&#13;
the more likely the infection will lead to severe sequella. Prior to 1955&#13;
epidemics were common, with local outbreaks occurring every year. Hence, the&#13;
incidence of poliomyelitis varied greatly across localities. For example, in&#13;
1959, in Nanning, the incidence of poliomyelitis was 151 per 100,000; in&#13;
Shanghai, the incidence was 30; in Tsingtao, 54; and in Kunming, 62 per&#13;
100,000, while incomplete aggregates of statistics from 17 provinces,&#13;
municipalities, and autonomous regions showed an overall incidence of 5 per&#13;
100,000. Live attenuated polio vaccine was introduced in China in 1960, and&#13;
since 1964 oral polio vaccine has been extensively supplied to the entire&#13;
country. In 1971 the average incidence of poliomyelitis for China was 2.12&#13;
per 100,000, which has declined to 0.5 per 100,000 in 1981. (The rate is&#13;
lower in the urban areas - 0.22 per 100,000 versus the rural areas of 1.05 per&#13;
100,000.)&#13;
Again, the incidence rate is likely an underestimate, since children&#13;
affected may be asymptomatic. In 1981, a national survey on the evaluation of&#13;
frequency of paralytic sequella of poliomyelitis was conducted in 12 provinces&#13;
(which include a population of 3,521,373 under the age of 30). As a result,&#13;
4,241 cases of paralytic polio were detected; the average prevalence of&#13;
paralytic poliomyelitis was 1.21 per 1,000 (see Annex Table 11). According to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
the results of recent surveys, WHO proposes to multiply the prevalence of&#13;
paralytic sequella by 1.25 to account for paralysis of muscles other than&#13;
lower limbs, and then again by 1.33 to account for clinical poliomyelitis&#13;
cases who either die or fully recover. This calculation indicates that the&#13;
prevalence of clinical poliomyelitis among the population surveyed had been&#13;
about 2 per 1,000.&#13;
The age-specific distribution of the prevalence rate in China&#13;
indicates that there is an age shift of affected cases toward older age&#13;
groups, which means that the mass campaigns have offered increasing coverage&#13;
and protection among the younger age groups. The age shift is more markedly&#13;
observed in urban areas: about 9 percent were of less than 15 years of age,&#13;
whereas in the rural areas, 49 percent of the cases were still less than 15&#13;
years of age (see Annex Table 12). The prevalence of paralytic poliomyelitis&#13;
is lower than the rates reported in selected surveys in Niger and Ghana (see&#13;
Table 14). In both Niger and Ghana, the prevalence is about 0.7 percent,&#13;
compared to 0.1 percent for rural children of comparable age in China.&#13;

Possible reasons to explain the inapparent protection by vaccine&#13;
were:&#13;
(a) ineffective cold chain, resulting in the loss of vaccine efficacy&#13;
during transport;&#13;
(b) virulence from the live vaccine causing the infection, which is&#13;
possible in China, although it has not been documented.&#13;
(c) Inappropriate use, resulting in the loss of vaccine effectiveness at&#13;
time of vaccination.&#13;
Rubella&#13;
Rubella is a common contagious disease of children and young&#13;
adults. The illness itself is usually mild and self-limited. The real&#13;
significance of rubella lies in its ability to cause congenital defects in&#13;
infants of women who acquire rubella during pregnancy. Congenital rubella&#13;
syndromes include congenital heart disease, cataracts, nerve deafness, and&#13;
mental retardation.&#13;
Rubella infection is universally endemic. Active immunity is&#13;
acquired by natural infection or by active immunization. Routine rubella&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
vaccination is not given in China. The incidence of the disease is high in&#13;
children. A rubella serosurvey conducted in Lanzhou city in 1980 on 1,157&#13;

About 95 percent of the female population acquire an antibody to&#13;
rubella by the time they reach childbearing age. Thus, 5 percent of women&#13;
between ages 21 to 35 are susceptible to rubella infection. An important&#13;
decision thus needs to be made: to identify and vaccinate susceptible women,&#13;
and to incorporate the rubella vaccine in the routine vaccination schedule in&#13;

order to avoid the risk of rubella infection during early pregnancy (when a&#13;
mother is capable of infecting the fetus), resulting in congenital defects to&#13;
the infant.&#13;
Diphtheria&#13;
Typically manifested as an acute infection of the throat, diphtheria&#13;
toxin can affect the heart or brain of infants and young children. Death in&#13;
diphtheria, however, is still mainly due to airway obstruction. The epi-&#13;
demiologic characteristics of the disease has changed concomitant with a&#13;
marked decrease in incidence since widespread vaccination campaigns.&#13;
In 1981, the nationwide incidence was 0.9 per 100,000. In the past&#13;
few years, no diphtheria cases were reported in 1,040 cities, prefectures, and&#13;
counties. A review of the characteristics of the reported cases over a 30-&#13;
year period between 1950 and 1979 in Guandong province showed that 60 to 78&#13;
percent of the cases occurred during the months between October and January.&#13;
The age distribution of patients ranges from 19 days to 37 years of age.&#13;
Overall, children less than 7 years old accounted for 84 percent of all the&#13;
cases. However, over the last 10 years, the age distribution of patients has&#13;
shifted toward older age groups. Between 1974-1975, about 11 percent of cases&#13;
were of children less than 7 years of age, whereas in the 1950s and 1960s at&#13;
least 70 percent occurred within the less than 7 year old group. This&#13;
indicated that immunization has provided protection to an increasing&#13;
proportion of the younger population which receives routine immunization. The&#13;
incidence is higher in urban areas, probably due to crowding which increases&#13;
the risk of exposure to contacts or carriers. Case fatality rates are still&#13;
higher in rural areas. This is probably due to differences in access to&#13;
health care between urban and the rural areas. The overall case fatality rate&#13;
is about 10 percent, which has changed very little for the last 10 years. The&#13;
virulence of the disease has decreased with widespread immunization&#13;
campaigns. There are fewer cases of generalized toxemia and relatively more&#13;
cases of cutaneous diphtheria. There are also possibilities of unapparent&#13;
infections which may outnumber recognized cases. Cutaneous diphtheria is&#13;
often indistinguishable from skin infections such as impetigo. Infections are&#13;
more often localized to nasopharyngeal involvement (90 percent), and much less&#13;
frequently laryngeal involvement.&#13;
Tuberculosis&#13;
Tuberculosis was the leading cause of death before liberation,&#13;
responsible for an estimated 200 to 230 annual deaths per 100,000&#13;
population. After liberation, with improvements in living standards (housing&#13;
and nutrition), immunization, and the availability of chemotherapy,&#13;
tuberculosis prevalence declined. Tuberculosis mortality by 1979 ranged&#13;
between 10 to 40 deaths per 100,000 population. In 1980, tuberculosis&#13;
mortality had dropped to 9th rank among causes of mortality. Bivariate&#13;
regression analysis seems to indicate that urbanization is associated with a&#13;
lower prevalence of tuberculosis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
A national tuberculosis morbidity survey was carried out in 1979.&#13;
The average prevalence of the disease in China was then 717 per 100,000&#13;
population. Annex Table 13 and Map shows the tuberculosis prevalence by&#13;
province. It was estimated from this survey that 2 million patients were&#13;
actively infectious (i.e., excrete bacillus). Nationwide age-specific&#13;
morbidity rates are not available; however, reports from some provinces and&#13;
cities indicate that childhood tuberculosis is still a major concern. The&#13;
overall prevalence for children less than 7 was estimated to be about 8&#13;
percent; the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis among primary school&#13;
children decreased from 1,700 per 100,000 in 1940 to 40 per 100,000. The&#13;
prevalence for children in middle school declined from 5,400 in 1940 to 200&#13;
per 100,000 population in 1979 in Beijing. But the prevalence for middle&#13;
school children has remained at 200 per 100,000 for the last 10 years. 2-/ At&#13;
present, in many regions in China, the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis is&#13;
highest among the group between 15 to 29 years of age.&#13;
In adults, pulmonary tuberculosis is the primary form of infection.&#13;
The disease takes many forms in children, infecting the bones, kidneys, or&#13;
brain. Often it may not be recognized as the same disease that affects&#13;
adults. Distribution of the affected organ in a report on 743 cases of&#13;
childhood tuberculosis showed that 44 percent were pulmonary, 22 percent&#13;
extrapulmonary (of which 80 percent were meningitis), and 34 percent were&#13;
combined pulmonary and extrapulmonary. Among these 743 cases, 85 percent&#13;
apparently had a history of receiving BCG vaccination.&#13;
Meningitis is the major cause of death in childhood tuberculosis.&#13;
Jiamusi City Tuberculosis Control Center in Heilongjiang Province reported&#13;
that between 1972 and 1979, about one-third of patients admitted had&#13;
tuberculosis meningitis. Inner Mongolia Pediatrics Hospital had 74 cases of&#13;
tuberculosis meningitis between 1978 and 1979, 51 percent of these patients&#13;
were children less than 2 years of age. Among the tuberculosis patients&#13;
admitted to a Sichuan Pediatric hospital, 62 percent were less than 5 years of&#13;
age, 30 percent were between 5 and 10, and 8 percent were between 10 and 12.&#13;
The prevalence of childhood tuberculosis is about the same for urban and rural&#13;
populations.&#13;
Where the infection rate is high, an effective vaccine could markedly&#13;
decrease the risk of developing tuberculosis. In China, the level of&#13;
infection rate is 1.1 percent among young children less than 7 years of age.&#13;
The level of the infection rate above which vaccination is indicated varies&#13;
with many factors. Most tuberculosis experts would place this level somewhere&#13;
between 5.0 and 0.5 new infections per 100 persons per year.&#13;
Meningitis is the first component of childhood tuberculosis that will&#13;
disappear with adequate BCG coverage. Thus, effectiveness of BCG vaccination&#13;
can be measured by decline or eradication of cases of tuberculosis meningi-&#13;
tis. BCG vaccination is a relatively harmless procedure. At present, BCG&#13;
vaccination is given to all newborns prior to discharge from hospitals, and&#13;

re-vaccination is given to children of 7 and 12 years of age, to newly&#13;
enrolled college students, factory workers, and military recruits. The BCG&#13;
vaccination campaign started in 1950 and was widely popularized. Shanghai&#13;
Second Medical College Affiliated Pediatrics-Hospital showed that the&#13;
incidence of tuberculosis meningitis has gradually declined (see Table 18).&#13;
However, the problem is still not negligible and this is partially due to sub-&#13;
optimal level of BCG coverage. More than 32 percent of the 1,295,000 persons&#13;
surveyed in the national tuberculosis sample survey had never received BCG.&#13;
Also, the effectiveness of BCG vaccination is questionable, since the liquid&#13;
vaccine produced in China has a validity of only 43 days. Therefore, it is&#13;
unlikely that all vaccinations throughout China are given with a potent&#13;
vaccine. Physicians from the Tuberculosis Institute of Heilongjiang Province&#13;
estimate that about 80 percent of the target population receives the vaccine,&#13;
of which only 60 to 80 percent are effectively immunized. Consequently, the&#13;
coverage of the target group is probably lower than 50 percent.&#13;

Japanese B Encephalitis&#13;
This is a mosquito transmitted viral disease which is seen throughout&#13;
East Asia, including Japan and Korea. Large epidemics were frequently seen&#13;
near Shanghai City until 1965, with the incidence approximately 54 per&#13;
100,000. Since 1965, the incidence in the Shanghai area has been around 2 to&#13;
3 per 100,000. From 1974 to 1981 it has ranged between 7 to 12 per 100,000&#13;
(see Table 19). Japanese B encephalitis is thought to be present in all of&#13;
China except Tibet and Xinjiang. Human cases peak at 4-5 years of age;&#13;
children are at higher risk of clinical infection than young adults.&#13;
Neurological sequella are noted in as many as 75 percent of survivors, and are&#13;
more severe in children under 10 years of age. About 80 million doses of&#13;
inactivated vaccine are produced annually in China. The target population are&#13;
children between the ages of 5 and 12, with the vaccination schedule being 2&#13;

1979, a booster every four years has been recommended.   About 100,000 cases of&#13;
Japanese B encepahlitis are still reported in China every year. Immunization&#13;
and control of vector breeding either by application of larvicides or&#13;
insecticides are available preventive measures of Japanese B encephalitis.&#13;
Hepatitis&#13;
The change in the prevalence of hepatitis in China is less dramatic&#13;
than in other countries. A trend of a high prevalence of hepatitis&#13;
continues. Table 20 reports on the total number of cases registered in China&#13;

Hepatitis A classically affects almost the entire population during&#13;
childhood with a demonstrable effect of socioeconomic status and sanitary&#13;
level on age-specific incidence pattern. The clinical disease in young&#13;
children is usually mild and the incidence of subclinical infection is high.&#13;
Infection results in clinical symptoms in 5 to 10 percent of infections&#13;
only. Outbreaks of hepatitis A occur mainly in children, or collective units&#13;
in primary and middle schools. The incidence has increased in the recent&#13;
years due partially to improvements in reporting. However, reports do not&#13;
usually identify A and B hepatitis and therefore the prevalence of the A form&#13;
is largely unknown, except for specific surveys.&#13;
In contrast to feco-oral transmission of hepatitis A, the mode of&#13;
hepatitis B transmission is mainly, although not exclusively, parenteral,&#13;
through inoculation by a contaminated needle, by infective serum or by blood&#13;
products. Transmission of hepatitis B from carrier mothers to their babies&#13;
during the perinatal period is an important determinant of the prevalence of&#13;
the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in some regions. The risk of infection may reach&#13;
50 percent. A survey in Henan reported an incidence of 44 percent of such&#13;
perinatal infections. Frequently, infected people become chronic carriers of&#13;
HBV, and chronicity is more likely to follow infections acquired in childhood&#13;
than those acquired in adult life. The highest prevalence of HBV is usually&#13;
found in children aged 4-8 years, with steadily declining rates among older&#13;
age groups.&#13;
The main epidemiological feature is the association between the HBV&#13;
infection and the development of primary liver carcinoma. The relative risk&#13;
of developing liver cancer in HBV carriers as compared to non-carriers is&#13;
estimated at about 150:1. Liver carcinoma is a fatal disease in almost 100&#13;
percent of cases. The coastal plain of China is one of the major world foci&#13;
of liver carcinoma, responsible for more than 20 annual deaths per 100,000&#13;
males in Shanghai municipality, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, and&#13;
Guangxi Autonomous Region (age-adjusted rates to 1964 census population of&#13;
China). Therefore, the prevention of hepatitis B through mass immunization in&#13;
affected areas is a priority for action in southern China.&#13;
The prevalence of clinical acute infectious hepatitis was 810 per&#13;
100,000 population for children less than 14 years of age in a Beijing survey&#13;
in 1979. Fourty-four percent of acute hepatitis cases were positive for type&#13;
A, 20 percent were positive for type B, 22 percent were negative for both&#13;
(non-A, non-B types), and 14 percent were positive for both type A and B. In&#13;
Zibo City, Shangdong, 30 percent of patients with acute viral hepatitis were&#13;
HBV positive. Beijing and Shanghai reported 38 percent and 44 percent,&#13;
respectivjjy, of hepatitis B among hospitalized hepatitis pediatric patients&#13;
in 1980. -'&#13;

Treatment of Childhood Hepatitis," Chinese Journal of Pediatrics, 20 (May,&#13;

The prevalence of HBV in apparently healthy individuals varies from&#13;
0.1 to 0.5 percent in North America to as high as 20 percent in Asian and&#13;
African endemic zones. The prevalence of HBV carriers in Wuhan city for&#13;
children less than 2 years of age was 22 percent, and 20 percent for children&#13;
3 to 6 years of age. In Shanghai City, among children less than 4 years in&#13;
day care centers surveyed, 30 percent were HBV carriers.   In Guizhou provinie&#13;
overall, the HBV carrier rate was 6 percent among 1,280 persons surveyed, -&#13;
whereas in Zib ,Shangdong, 12 percent of apparently health individuals were&#13;
HBV positive. _&#13;
Prevention of hepatitis B depends on minimizing risk of direct&#13;
contact with contaminated blood, through testing of donor blood for HBV and&#13;
proper sterilization of reusable needles or regular examinations of food&#13;
handlers and day care personnel. Several vaccines are now available in&#13;
Europe, United States and Japan. China is actively involved in the research&#13;
on hepatitis B vaccines, and considers mass immunization as a priority for&#13;
public health. Prevention of hepatitis A is a relatively difficult task,&#13;
since it depends on improvement of agricultural sanitation and decreased&#13;
frequency of fecal contamination to water supply and vegetables. Human and&#13;
animal wastes are heavily utilized for fertilizer production. Environmental&#13;
pollution is difficult to control until sanitary methods of fertilizer&#13;
storage, processing and application are applied. In the rural areas, at least&#13;
50 percent of the population still uses surface water. Ground water is highly&#13;
susceptible to fecal contamination when there is no strict standards in sewage&#13;
disposal.&#13;
Epidemic Meningitis&#13;
Meningococci are found only in humans. They are spread from the&#13;
nasopharynx of one person to that of another, probably by respiratory&#13;
droplets. Transmission is most intense in closed, crowded conditions.&#13;
Meningococcal disease occurs with a peak in late winter and early spring.&#13;
Most large epidemics of menigococcal disease are caused by serogroup A.&#13;
Table 21 presents the nationwide incidence rate for the period 1974&#13;
to 1981. A review of cases for all counties in Xuchang prefecture, Henan&#13;
province, during 1953-1979 illustrated several epidemiologic characteristics&#13;
of meningitis. The incidence was highest in February to April in either&#13;
epidemic or non-epidemic years. A severe epidemic occurred every 8-10&#13;
years. The incidence was highest in children of 7 to 15 years of age. The&#13;
fatality rate was highest among the 0-3 age group. In Xuchang prefecture, the&#13;
average fatality rate was 9 percent and showed a gradual decline from year to&#13;
year. The highest fatality rate was 37 percent in 1955, and the lowest was 4&#13;

associated with improvement of health care and hygienic conditions. In China&#13;

Among groups of people, the incidence of the disease is directly&#13;
related to the carrier rate. A survey of 2,359 persons in Xuchang prefecture&#13;
indicated that 29 percent of people sampled were meningococcal carriers. The&#13;
carrier rate in the epidemic region was about 62 percent, and was 13 percent&#13;

in the non-epidemic region. The carrier rate of serogroup A in the epidemic&#13;
region was 26 percent, and that of the non-epidemic region was 1 percent.&#13;
Production and efficacy trials of different vaccines have been&#13;
carried out since 1966 in China. In 1973, a purified vaccine was produced and&#13;
a five-year trial was carried out which provided a protection rate of 80&#13;
percent. However, the vaccine had severe side reactions. Between 1980 and&#13;
1981, A4 strain polysaccharide vaccine was used, and the incidence rate of&#13;
meningitis for the recipient group was 2.20 versus 43.16 for the placebo&#13;
group. A four-fold rise of antibody was present in 88 percent of the&#13;
vaccinated group; this was significantly higher than the placebo group (25&#13;
percent). This vaccine has been adopted for mass immunization.&#13;

IV. NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF CHILDREN&#13;
A. Diet and Food Supply&#13;
Diet&#13;
Human milk offers one of the best ways to close the "protein gap" in&#13;
the developing world. A major problem encountered today in developing&#13;
countries is very early weaning or substitution of breast-feeding with cow's&#13;
milk. In China, both in the cities and in the countryside, breast-feeding is&#13;
still the "method of choice". At least 90 percent (more in the range of 95-98&#13;
percent) of all infants are breastfed today. In urban families, an infant is&#13;
breastfed for 8-9 months. In rural households, babies are usually breast-fed&#13;
for at least 18 months. The measures taken by the Chinese health authorities&#13;
to facilitate breast-feeding are noteworthy. All mothers employed in&#13;
factories or working for the government are given 2 months maternity leave&#13;
with pay, in order to allow for breast-feeding. Thereafter, mothers are&#13;
provided 2 half-hour breaks during their work day to breastfeed their&#13;
infants. In the rural areas, the daily schedule of nursing mothers is&#13;
arranged so that they can feed their infants at regular intervals. A more&#13;
recent study in Shanghai in 1981, however, showed that only 32 percent of&#13;
infants in urban districts and 74 percent of infants in rural areas are&#13;
breastfed for 6 months. The trend toward bottle feeding may unfavorably&#13;
increase as people in the cities adopt it as a sign of westernization. In the&#13;
cities, majority of the women are engaged in the labor force, hence the&#13;
grandparents are the primary caretakers of the children. In rural areas, the&#13;
change from collective to individual or household production may force mothers&#13;
to give up the choice of breastfeeding in order to increase their time spent&#13;
in the field for production.&#13;
Supplementary feedings begin at six months of age (occasionally&#13;
earlier), and consists of cereal porridge. Over the following months, pureed&#13;
vegetables, fruits, and eggs are added. Finely chopped meat, chicken, pork or&#13;
fish, rice, and noodles are added in the second year.&#13;
After two years of age, the children begin to eat a diet which their&#13;
parents eat. Vitamins are not given to all children regularly. Vitamin A and&#13;
D are the only ones administered with any frequency, in the form of cod-liver&#13;
oil capsules by some parents.&#13;
Food Supply and Consumption&#13;
China's food requirements are enormous. The per capita food energy&#13;
availability in China changed very little during the period 1959 to 1977 (see&#13;
Annex Table 14). Based on estimates from aggregate data, China has an&#13;
adequate level of nutrient availability with respect to requirement. Its per&#13;
capita daily availability of energy and protein is higher than that of low&#13;
income countries, and is at a comparable level with many middle income&#13;
countries (see Table 23). Grains and soya products are the main sources of&#13;

availability varies by region. Nutrient availabilities in some provinces of&#13;
the southwest and northwest regions are lower than the national average.&#13;
However, the differences are not large (see Annex Tables 15 and 16).&#13;

International comparisons of the growth of Chinese children have been&#13;
made with ethnic Chinese children living in Hong Kong and Singapore. The&#13;
studies show that Chinese infants have, on an average, heights and weights&#13;
above the North American 58th percentile levels during the first six months of&#13;
life. In the latter half of the first year of life, they begin to fall behind&#13;
the North American standards. The mean values in Shanghai do not fall much&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
below 25th percentile levels, and in the later preschool years they are&#13;
consistently above that level, both for height and weight. The mean values of&#13;
Chinese children in Hong Kong and Singapore fall below the 10th percentile&#13;
levels for weight, 267d remain there throughout the preschool period (see&#13;
Figures 4 and 5). 2     Results of comparison with other countries, such as&#13;
Nepal, Sri Lanka, Togo, and Liberia, indicate that there is less stunting&#13;
among suburban Chinese children than among rural children from other countries&#13;
(see Table 25).&#13;
Within China, available data suggest a positive similar change in the&#13;
growth of children. The improvement, however, is not uniform throughout&#13;
China. The proportion of stunting in rural children is higher than in urban&#13;
children (see Annex Tables 17, 18, 19 and 20). Data from 16 provinces in 1979&#13;
(see Annex Table 19) showed that about 13 percent of rural 7-year old boys are&#13;
stunted compared with 3 percent of urban boys. The proportion of stunting in&#13;
1979 is less severe than the relatively comparable data of 1975. In 1975, 26&#13;
percent of 7 to 8 year old suburban boys and 4 percent of urban boys were&#13;
stunted. There is a geographical variation in the extent of malnutrition,&#13;
southern provinces more than northern provinces.&#13;
Jamison 27/ reviewed anthropometric data sets from different time&#13;
periods which included Guangzhou (1952-75); Beijing (1958-80); rural Shanghai&#13;
(1959-79); 9 cities (1975); and 16 provinces survey (1979). A summary of some&#13;
of the findings are presented in Table 26. The Z scores represent the number&#13;
of standard deviations above (+) and below (-) the NCHS median. Again, the&#13;
data show the urban and rural differences in height and weight. School&#13;
children in rural Shanghai do better than their counterparts in rural&#13;
Guangzhou. The rate of increase in height in China for the last 2 decades for&#13;
9-year olds was 1.55 cm. per decade in rural Shanghai, 2.49 cm. in Guangzhou&#13;
City, 1.48 cm. for rural Guangdong, and 3.8 cm. for urban Beijing. Similar&#13;
data from the 19 provinces of 1979, when compared to 1953-58, indicated an&#13;
average height increase of 2.3 cm. for males and 2.1 cm. for females per&#13;
decade for urban children and youths of 7 to 18 years of age, and an increase&#13;
in weight of 1.35 kg. per decade for males and 0.92 kg. for females.&#13;
The rate of growth over the last 25 years was slightly higher than&#13;
the growth rate of European counterparts, which had an average of 1.5 cm.&#13;
height increase per decade and 0.5 kg. weight increase per decade. The growth&#13;
rate, however, was slower than for Japanese counterparts, which had an&#13;
increase of 3.25 cm. in height per decade for males and 2.93 cm. for females,&#13;

population; we might expect an even higher prevalence of growth faltering in&#13;
the more remote rural areas of China. However, the growth attainment achieved&#13;
in China with the limited nutrient availability is greater in comparison with&#13;
several developing countries where anthropometric data are available.&#13;
C. Micronutrient Deficiency Diseases&#13;
A review of nutrition publications to date does not provide&#13;
additional information on the extent of micronutrient deficiencies in China.&#13;
It is difficult to measure improvement in specific nutritional diseases. In&#13;
general, micronutrient deficiency is no longer a major problem in China.&#13;
There is relatively little vitamin A deficiency, which is commonly associated&#13;
with protein-energy deficiency disease in many developing countries.&#13;
Intake of B vitamins may be low, since their highest concentration is&#13;
in eggs and meat. However, no data are available on the prevalence of vitamin&#13;
B deficiency diseases. Lack of vitamin BI (thiamine) may have become less of&#13;
a problem after elimination of polished rice. Pellagra (vitamin B6&#13;
deficiency) mainly occurs in adults. Prevalence of goiter, which also occurs&#13;
almost exclusively in adults, has decreased over time with intensive efforts&#13;
in health education in endemic areas. Local policies, such as the subsidy of&#13;
production of iodinated salt, and licensing merchants to sell only iodinated&#13;
salts, have widened the coverage of the population being protected from low&#13;
iodine intakes.&#13;
Anemia&#13;
On average, about one-third of Chinese children suffer from anemia.&#13;
Anemia is a sign, not a disease. Diseases that give rise to anemia in&#13;
children are primarily malnutrition, malaria, hookworm, congenital defects of&#13;
hemoglobin, and several other infections. Nutritional anemia, due to lack of&#13;
nutrients (iron and protein) or loss of iron and protein from the bowel due to&#13;
hookworm infestation, is still prevalent in China. A 1979 survey of children&#13;
aged 1 month to 7 years of age in Beijing and Shanxi found 47 percent to be&#13;
moderately anemic (hemoglobin of 9-12 gram percent) and 2.4 percent to be&#13;
severely anemic (hemoglobin less than 9 gram percent). A nutritional survey&#13;
was conducted in urban day care centers and nurseries in Beijing from 1979 to&#13;
1980. The percent of children aged 1.5 to 3 years with hemoglobin below 11&#13;
gram percent ranged from 10 to 27 percent, and for children aged 3-6 years it&#13;

ranged from 15 to 34 percent (see Annex Table 21). A special survey by staff&#13;
from the medical college of 45 brigades in Lintong county, Shaanxi province,&#13;
reported a 27 percent prevalence of anemia in children under 7. In Yangsuo&#13;
county, Guangxi Autonomous Region, 69 percent of the children under 1 were&#13;
anemic, and 43 percent of children between 1-2 years and 67 percent of&#13;
children between 2-3 years had hemoglobin values less than 11 grams percent.&#13;
A survey conducted in 16 provinceW9}n 1980 showed that overall, 50 percent of&#13;
children had nutritional anemia. -     Important variations exist between&#13;
regions, between urban and rural areas, and between groups of population with&#13;
different levels of income.&#13;
Rickets - Vitamin D deficiency&#13;
Rickets is a chronic nutritional disorder caused by vitamin D&#13;
deficiency due to failure to expose the skin to the ultraviolet rays of the&#13;
sun. It generally occurs during the first two years of life when growth is&#13;
rapid. Rickets is responsible for bowed legs, knock-knees, flat feet and&#13;
saber legs, and is associated with rachitic rosary and pigeon breast. The&#13;
deformity of pelvic bones produced by rickets during childhood is one of the&#13;
causes of difficult labor in pregnant women, and may result in fetal or&#13;
maternal death.&#13;
The overall prevalence rate of rickets in China is not available. In&#13;
1979, a sample survey of 10 provinces of over 70,000 children 3 years old and&#13;
younger found a prevalence of rickets of 29 percent. About 9 percent of&#13;
children younger than 3 years of age in QiYi Commune, Shanghai County, in&#13;
annual surveys conducted from 1978 to 1980, was found to have rickets (see&#13;
Table 27). In Rudong County, Jiangsu province, 30 percent of a sample of 674&#13;
children under the age of 7 had rickets. There is a regional difference in&#13;
the prevalence rate; it is higher in the northern or mountainous regions in&#13;
high altitudes, where rickets is associated with long winters and shorter&#13;
hours of daylight. For example, clinical estimates from well-baby clinics of&#13;

Huaide County, Jilin province, indicate that 41 percent of children under age&#13;
7 had symptoms of rickets in 1982-83.&#13;
Rickets has been historically and remains a problem of the northern&#13;
provinces. Although there is no national policy, in some northern provinces&#13;
vitamin D supplements, such as cod-liver oil, are given to children during&#13;
winter months.&#13;
Keshan Disease&#13;
Keshan disease, a chronic cardiomyopathy which may result from&#13;
selenium deficiency, has been prevalent in China for more than a hundred&#13;
years. The disease was named after Keshan county in Heilongjiang province,&#13;
where the first epidemiologic survey of this disease was carried out in&#13;
1935. Since then, cases have been reported from 206 counties located in 14&#13;
provinces and autonomous regions. Figure 6 presents the incidence of Keshan&#13;
disease in Heilongjiang Province between 1955 and 1979, and the overall&#13;
decline of reported cases in that province.&#13;
The disease is distributed in a belt-like zone located between the&#13;
coastal zone of south eastern China and the inland zone of northwestern&#13;
China. The affected sites are usually distributed in hilly land, and are&#13;
seldom seen in high mountains or plains. Ninety-five percent of cases occur&#13;
in children between 2 and 7 years of age. Figures 7 and 8 indicate the age&#13;
distribution of cases in children. The prevalence of the disease in endemic&#13;
areas may reach 1 percent of children under 10 years of age. In recent years,&#13;
the incidence has sharply decreased to less than 5 per 100,000 from the 3 peak&#13;
years in 1959, 1964 and 1970, when the incidence was over 40 per 100,000. The&#13;
case fatality rate has declined from about 5 deaths per 100,000 population in&#13;
the peak years to less than 1 death per 100,000 population between 1978 to&#13;
1980. The alteration of diet to include high selenium food, such as maize and&#13;
soybean, or sodium selenite supplements have been found to be effective&#13;
preventive measures.&#13;

V. OTHER CHILDHOOD DISEASES&#13;
A. Parasitic Infections&#13;
Malaria&#13;
In 1953, 11 percent of China's population lived in hyperendemic areas&#13;
where malaria transmission occurs throughout the year as a result of the&#13;
presence of all three malaria parasites: P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P.&#13;
malariae. Fifty percent of the population in China lived in an area where&#13;
malaria transmission was due to P. vivax, which occurs for six months out of&#13;
the year, and 32 percent of China's 1953 population lived in areas where&#13;
malaria is unstable as a result of P. vivax transmission during short periods&#13;
only. About 8 percent of China's population lived in malaria-free areas.&#13;
Sample surveys in 1953 reported a 70 percent infection rate among children in&#13;
Guangdong. An extensive malaria control program was started in 1950 through&#13;
mass treatment, mass chemoprophylaxis during the transmission period,&#13;
extensive use of residual indoor insecticide spraying, and control of larval&#13;
breeding sites. The incidence of malaria since that time has decreased&#13;
steadily. Between 1950 and 1981, the total number of malaria cases decreased&#13;
from an estimated 30 million cases to a reported 3 million cases. The number&#13;
of counties endemic for malaria decreased from 70 percent of the total number&#13;
of counties to 28 percent. Today, only about 6 percent of the 2,100 counties&#13;
in China are in high risk areas. In 1979, 30 percent of China's population&#13;
lived in malaria-free areas, and 35 percent lived in areas where malaria is&#13;
sporadic (fewer than 5 cases per 10,000 population per year). Twenty-eight&#13;
percent of China's population lived in areas of moderate risk (between 5 and&#13;
100 cases per 10,000 population per year), and 2 percent lived in high malaria&#13;
risk areas (greater than 100 cases per 10,000). National statistics indicated&#13;
an overall incidence of about 300 cases per 100,000 population in 1981.&#13;
Cases reported from Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Anhui and Hubei&#13;
provinces in 1981 accounted for 86 percent of the total number of cases in&#13;
China. In these provinces, P. vivax is mostly prevalent and P. falciparum&#13;
malaria, the only form that causes death, has a diffuse distribution. Age-&#13;
specific morbidity and mortality figures for malaria in China are difficult to&#13;
obtain. Mortality from malaria in children is probably limited to southern&#13;
China in some parts of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces, and Hainan&#13;
Island, where falciparum malaria morbidity is still comparatively high and&#13;
where resistance to chloroquine was recently documented. However, malaria is&#13;
not an important factor of child mortality, since only 70 deaths due to&#13;
malaria occurred in China in 1981 among the 3 million reported cases.&#13;
Intestinal Parasites&#13;
The intestinal worms which are most prevalent and are most&#13;
debilitating are (i) Ascaris lumbricoides, (ii) Ancylostoma duodenale, and&#13;
(iii) Trichiuris trichiura. One-third of the entire world population is&#13;
estimated to be infected by one or more worm species. Ascaris, Ancylostoma&#13;
and Trichiuris are often associated in the same patient.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
The clinical symptoms are usually inapparent; however, the two most&#13;
damaging symptoms are malnutrition and anemia. Worms excrete toxins&#13;
(roundworms (ascaris) in particular) which have an inhibiting effect on the&#13;
digestive enzymes, and hence result in malabsorption syndromes.&#13;
Ancylostomiasis is cited as a major cause of anemia. The anemia may be&#13;
further exacerbated by undernutrition. Blood loss caused by any single&#13;
Ancylostoma worm in an infected person can be as much as 0.67 ml. a day. With&#13;
average worm loads of Ancylostoma ranging between 50 and 500 worms per&#13;
infected person, the blood loss can be as high as 300 ml. per day.&#13;
Ascaris infection in children retards growth. The percent of dietary&#13;
calories lost per day due to average Ascaris worm burdens (+7 worms per&#13;
person) is estimated at 2 to 3 percent.   Winfield made an estimate in 1939 3&#13;
on the impact of ascaris infestation on nutrient intake. He estimated that&#13;
about 336 million people (out of a total population of 400 million) in China&#13;
were parasitized by 6 billion adult ascarids, which would weight about 24,300&#13;
metric tons and would cost about one and a half million pounds sterling&#13;
annually for food (1939 prices). The cost to the country for treatment of&#13;
patients, along with the additional indirect cost from loss of work produc-&#13;
tivity in adults or growth faltering in children as result of decreased&#13;
nutrition intake, are phenomenal.&#13;
The recent documentation on intestinal parasites in China is poor.&#13;
It does not seem that the disease is a priority for action, nor that&#13;
surveillance is actively conducted. However, scattered information indicates&#13;
that the magnitude of the problem probably did not change much since&#13;
liberation (see Annex Table 22). A recent sample survey in Shaanxi province&#13;
of 10,000 population showed that 71 percent has Ascaris, 10 percent has&#13;
Trichiuris, 71 percent has Enterobius vermicularis, and 3 percent has&#13;
Ancylostoma. Also in Shaanxi, a 1981 survey of 969 children in two schools in&#13;
rural areas of Lintong county reported an 81 percent infection rate with&#13;
Ascaris among children aged 7 to 12, and 65 percent among children aged 12 to&#13;
14. Another survey of a school sample in Zhangqin county, Shandong Province,&#13;
showed in 1974 that ascaris was prevalent in 91 percent of children below 9&#13;
years of age, with an average number of 37,300 eggs per gram of feces. In&#13;
Heilongjiang Province, ascaris was present in 37 percent of children in a&#13;
sample survey in Suihua county in 1981 (personal communication).&#13;
Kala Azar&#13;
In 1949, there were 650,000 cases of Kala Azar, and the majority of&#13;
its victims were children. The case fatality rate was about 5 percent. It is&#13;
now reported that through the use of insecticides, antimony preparations, and&#13;
the extermination of stray dogs, the disease has been almost completely&#13;
eliminated. A few cases are still reported from regions where cattle herding&#13;
is extensively practiced, such as Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang (Sinkiang).&#13;

B. Endemic Diseases&#13;
Endemic Fluorosis&#13;
Fluoride is an essential micronutrient. The optimal level of&#13;
fluoride for drinking water varies with temperature, but the range is usually&#13;
between 0.5 to 1.0 mg/l. Excess consumption of fluoride in areas where&#13;
potable water contains a higher concentration may result in fluorosis&#13;
(mottling of teeth and damage of bone).&#13;
Dental fluorosis occurs more frequently in children. Skeletal&#13;
fluorosis occurs more frequently in adults with chronic exposure to excess&#13;
fluoride content in drinking water. In China, the northeast and northwest&#13;
regions and Shangdong Province are the endemic areas. Table 28 gives the&#13;
result of a survey in 4 counties in Shangdong, which shows an increasing&#13;
prevalence of dental fluorosis as the concentration of fluoride in drinking&#13;
water increases. The data did not present the age-specific prevalence rate.&#13;
Kaschin-Beck Disease (Osteoarthritis deformans)&#13;
The onset of symptoms begins around age of 7, consisting of joint&#13;
swelling, muscle atrophy, and limb deformity, which may result in stunting in&#13;
children.&#13;
The disease is common among children and adolescents in the areas of&#13;
northeast, northwest, and north China. The provinces of Shaanxi,&#13;
Heilongjiang, Gansu, and Sichuan are high incidence sites. A three-year study&#13;
of Yangzhou County, Shaanxi Province, which has the highest incidence of&#13;
Kaschin-Beck disease, indicated that the disease may be prevented by replacing&#13;
a low selenium content maize diet with high selenium content wheat.&#13;
Data on the age-specific prevalence rate for the endemic regions are&#13;
not available. Figures for Heilongjiang show that there are about 600,000&#13;
cases concentrated in limited foci. For example, 402 cases are documented in&#13;
Suihua County (which has a population of 719,000), but all of these cases&#13;
occur among the 2,063 population of two production brigades.&#13;
C. Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease&#13;
The incidence of Rheumatic Fever (RF) has declined markedly in&#13;
developed countries, in contrast to the continuing high prevalence of the&#13;
disease in developing countries.&#13;
RF is a sequel of pharyngeal infection with group A Streptococcus.&#13;
RF is rare in children less than four years of age. The peak incidence is age&#13;
group 4-15, but both primary cases and recurrence cases are frequently seen in&#13;
adults. The incidence of RF is declining in China. From a survey in Guandong&#13;

in 1978, Sh7 incidence of RF among school children age 6-14 was 81 per&#13;
100,000.  -   Although this is higher than the incidence in the U.S. (3 per&#13;
100,000), it i 2} ower than other developing countries such as India (200-1,200&#13;
per 100,000). -&#13;
The signs and symptoms of RF can vary greatly. Clinical&#13;
manifestations can include varying combinations of polyarthritis, carditis,&#13;
subcutaneous nodule, erythema marginatum and chorea. Carditis (Rheumatic&#13;
Heart Disease) is the most debilitating manifestation. Episodes of carditis&#13;
occurring with recurrent attacks of RF can result in permanent cardiac damage&#13;
or death. Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) is the most common cause of chronic&#13;
heart disease in children and young adults. It carries significant&#13;
morbidity. One-fourth of hospitalized cardiac disease cases in the 1970s were&#13;
still due to RHD, which has declined from 50 percent in the 1950s. The&#13;
mortality rate of RHD is also high. In Tienjin Children's Hospital the&#13;
mortality rate of hospitalized children with RHD was 30 perce3s, of which 75&#13;
percent of affected children were less than 15 years of age. -&#13;
The prevalence rate of RHD reported from several mass surveys vary&#13;
around 3 per 1000. Between 1976 and 1978, the prevalence rate was 3 per 1000&#13;
in Panyu Count 4/Guandong Province (a survey sample of 170,469 farmers of age&#13;
15 and over). -     A province-wide survey in Guandong (sample of 312,848&#13;
people age 15 and over) showed a standardized prevalence rate of 2.89 per&#13;
1000. Groups over 45 years of age had a higher prevalence rate, 4 ger 1000,&#13;
and age group 6-18 had the lowest prevalence rate, 1.1 per 1000. _&#13;
An aggregate prevalence rate was 1.83 per 1000 from a survey of 14&#13;
provinces (778,599 persons). The rate was 0.54 per 1000 for children aged&#13;
6-14 (sample of 262,317) and 2.48 per 1000 for adults. Southern provinces&#13;
such as Guandong have a 86her prevalence rate than the northern provinces of&#13;
Jilin and Heilongjiang.&#13;

The reported decline in the incidence of RF and prevalence of RHD is&#13;
supported by the fact that there is a shift in the age groups of the affected&#13;
population. Older age groups have the highest prevalence rates of RHD and&#13;
active episodes of RF. In the 1950s the peak age group for the prevalence&#13;
rate of RHD was 20-29; in the 1960s the peak age group was 30-39; and in the&#13;
1970s the peak age group shifted to 40-49.&#13;
Initial and recurrent attacks of RF are preventable by treatment or&#13;
prophylaxis of the antecedent streptococcal infection. Accurate diagnosis is&#13;
required for primary prevention of RF. This is difficult to achieve because&#13;
streptococcal pharyngitis occurs most frequently in children, who seldom come&#13;
to medical attention, and in addition one-third or more cases of RF arise&#13;
after clinical inapparent streptococcal infection.&#13;
The most effective strategy for avoiding the mortality and chronic&#13;
cardiac disability is 'secondary prevention', i.e. focus on persons who&#13;
already suffered a rheumatic attack and who are susceptible to a recurrence&#13;
following upper respiratory infection. Antibiotics should be given to all&#13;
patients who have suffered a documented attack of RF. To ensure patient&#13;
follow-up for continuing prophylaxis, patient education is important in&#13;
addition to establishing ongoing service to provide antimicrobial prophylaxis&#13;
in either the Maternal Child Health or the Epidemic Prevention Station.&#13;

VI. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH CARE SERVICES&#13;
The Chinese primary health care system operates on three levels:&#13;
brigade health station, commune health center, and the county hospital (Annex&#13;
Chart 1). The brigade health station is the base of the pyramid of the three-&#13;
tier system. Two or three Barefoot Doctors provide care for a population of&#13;
1000 to 3000. The commune health centers receive referrals from the brigade&#13;
health stations and are responsible for technical supervision and training of&#13;
Barefoot Doctors at the brigade level. At the county level, which is the top&#13;
of the three-tiered system, there are three health care units: the county&#13;
hospital, the county epidemic prevention station, and the county maternal and&#13;
child health station. The county hospital serves as the referral center for&#13;
the entire county (from approximately 400,000 to 1,300,000 population). The&#13;
county epidemic prevention station, which is responsible for preventive&#13;
activities, provides technical support and supervision to the commune health&#13;
centers. The county maternal and child health station supervises and provides&#13;
maternal child health activities.&#13;
The MCH services are vertically organized from the ministry to the&#13;
provincial, prefectural, and county levels. The MCH centers are responsible&#13;
for providing maternal child health care services, including family planning,&#13;
prenatal and obstetrical care, and surveillance of infants and children. The&#13;
framework is shown in Figure 9. The distribution of MCH facilities by&#13;
province in 1982 are set out in Table 29.&#13;
A. Maternal Health Care&#13;
The Maternal and Child Health service (MCH) is responsible for care&#13;
for women at all stages of their reproductive cycle, the so-called 5&#13;
periods: menstrual, prenatal, intrapartum, postnatal, and menopausal. In&#13;
1949, there were only 80 maternal child health centers, with 1,762 beds for&#13;
all of China (see Table 30). Women in rural areas relied entirely on&#13;
traditional birth attendants (see Table 31). After liberation, the&#13;
traditional birth attendants were retrained, in addition to the large&#13;
increment of health workers trained for MCH services. The number of MCH&#13;
stations increased 293-fold, and the number of beds in MCH centers increased&#13;
8-fold (see Table 30). However, nationwide, the MCH units only account for&#13;
1.4 percent of the total health care facilities. There is a wide variation&#13;
among provinces. Xinjiang has less than half a percent of total health&#13;
facilities as MCH units. Qinghai has almost 3 percent (see Table 29; Annex&#13;
Table 23).&#13;
At the county level, there is a maternal and child health station&#13;
whose staff provides guidance, supervision, and administrative support to the&#13;
maternal health services of the county. For example, Qufu county in Shandong&#13;
Province (with 0.5 million inhabitants) is staffed by 4 senior physicians, 16&#13;
assistant physicians, and 10 mid-level nurses, who perform and organize the&#13;
MCH activities in the county. The MCH staff organizes and participates in the&#13;
county-wide screening programs, such as surveys of prevalence of gynecological&#13;
diseases. In each brigade health station there is a female BFD in charge of&#13;

MCH. Prenatal services are provided to pregnant women once the pregnancy is&#13;
diagnosed. The BFDs provide most of the routine prenatal care, such as&#13;
measurement of blood pressure. Some pregnant women go to the commune health&#13;
centers for check-ups. Pregnant women who develop complications such as&#13;
hypertension or oedema, or have a family history of congenital defects are&#13;
referred to the county level MCH centers. The quality of care, as measured by&#13;
reported complications rates, has steadily improved. The frequency of&#13;
postpartum hemorrhage and infections have declined.&#13;
The coverage of midwives per population increased from 26,705&#13;
population per midwife to 13,828 per midwife, between 1952 and 1980.&#13;
Nowadays, there is nearly complete coverage of deliveries by hospital or by&#13;
rural birth attendants. Over 90 percent of deliveries are performed by the&#13;
so-called "scientific method," i.e. using sterile instruments. On the&#13;
average, there are 1.4 barefoot doctors per 1,000 rural population. As a&#13;
result of increased access to health services, the incidence of neonatal&#13;
tetanus and postpartum infection have drastically declined.&#13;
Besides antenatal care, the BFTs and health personnels in the commune&#13;
health centers and county MCH centers also provide postpartum care. The BFDs&#13;
provide home visits to the mother and the infants within one week after&#13;
discharge from the hospital. Gynecological services, such as treatment of&#13;
common gynecological diseases, are provided in the commune and county MCH&#13;
centers. Screening for gynecological diseases, such as cervicitis and&#13;
cervical cancer, are conducted every two to three years. Women who have&#13;
cervicitis, salpingitis, or vaginitis are treated. Those diagnosed with&#13;
possible malignancy are referred to either commune or county level for further&#13;
work-up. In Qufu county (Shandong Province), for example, the MCH health&#13;
centers carry out systematic examination of all married women below 60 years&#13;
of age every three years. The most common diseases are cervicitis,&#13;
salpingitis, and menstrual disorders. The prevalence of these disorders among&#13;
women in Qufu county was abut 20 percent. Contraceptives are dispensed at all&#13;
levels of the health care system. Intrauterine devices are inserted at the&#13;
commune hospitals or higher level medical centers. However, in some areas the&#13;
BFDs are also trained to insert IUDs. Abortions are perfomed at the commune&#13;
health centers or county level MCH health centers.&#13;
A survey in 12 provinces reflected a steady increase in the&#13;
percentage of births delivered by C-sections in recent years. The rate of C-&#13;
sections ranges from 7 to 38 percent. The reasons attributed to the increase&#13;
are (i) an increased proportion of primid gravidas, which in general have a&#13;
higher prevalence of difficult deliveries, (ii) an increased frequency of&#13;
intrapartum monitoring, resulting in earlier diagnosis of fetal distress,&#13;
(iii) a relaxing of criteria for C-sections by health personnel under the one&#13;
child family policy aimed at improving pregnancy outcome, and (iv) the demand&#13;
by families for C-sections in order to decrease the risks associated with&#13;
vaginal deliveries. In certain areas, the rate of C-section deliveries&#13;
increased from 7 percent in 1976 to 29 percent in 1981. The associated&#13;
maternal risks of C-sections are many, including bleeding, wound infection,&#13;
and chronic endometritis. Thus, even under the pressure to optimize pregnancy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
outcome, the criteria for C-sections should be strictly medical, rather than&#13;
letting socially related factors influence medical decisions.&#13;
B. Child Health Care&#13;
In 1949, China had only 5 children's hospitals, all in the urban&#13;
cities, with a total of 139 beds. In 1980, there were 24 specialized&#13;
children's hospitals with 5,407 beds, located in 18 of the 29 provinces,&#13;
autonomous regions and municipalities. Annex Table 23 presents the&#13;
distribution of children's hospitals by province. There is great inter-&#13;
provincial variation, with 11 provinces and regions lacking this type of&#13;
facility. However, many general hospitals encompass pediatrics departments&#13;
and the availability of beds for child care exceeds by large the capacity of&#13;
specialized children's facilities.&#13;
Since 1949, a 3-level child health care service network, in&#13;
conjuction with maternal health care, has been entensively developed. Child&#13;
health services, which include home visits for care of newborns, routine&#13;
physical examinations, mass screening of school age children, supervision of&#13;
nurseries and kindergartens, and routine immunization, are carried out by&#13;
health staff from all three levels, that is, (i) barefoot doctors, (ii) health&#13;
personnel at the commune health centers who carry out activities under the&#13;
supervision and guidance of staff from the county MCH centers, and (iii)&#13;
pediatric staff from the county hospitals. The immunization services are&#13;
usually done in collaboration with the county and commune epidemic prevention&#13;
stations. The staff from the epidemic prevention station plan and organize&#13;
the logistics for vaccine distribution. The BFDs and MCH staff are&#13;
responsible for identifying the target group and giving the vaccination.&#13;
Children in China have easy access to health care services. In 1982,&#13;
there were 31,991 Western trained pediatricians, 24 malor pediatrics hospi-&#13;
tals, and 18,091 MCH centers and clinics for the 339 million children under&#13;
age 14. There is, however, a lack of integration of services. Curative&#13;
services for children at different ages are provided by BFDs and health staff&#13;
in commune health centers and county hospitals. Preventive services, such as&#13;
growth monitoring of a well baby, mass surveys of school age children, and&#13;
immunizations, are provided by the staff from maternal child health care&#13;
centers and epidemic prevention stations. It is only at the brigade level&#13;
that the services are integrated and continuity of care is provided.&#13;
There are very little data on the assessment of the quality of&#13;
staff. Coverage of immunization has attained a rate over 90 percent.&#13;
However, efficacy of the vaccinations is handicapped by the poor quality of&#13;
vaccines. From the available verification reports on immunization against&#13;
preventable diseases, lack of knowledge of vaccine handling was still a common&#13;
reason for patients contracting the disease despite having received the&#13;
vaccination. A study of barefoot doctors' practice showed that there is heavy&#13;
use of antibiotics for treatment of illnesses, such as common cold and acute&#13;
gastroenteritis. In 335 cases of common cold, BFDs prescribed an average of&#13;
1.6 drugs per patient: 32 percent of the cases received antibiotics, 52&#13;
percent received traditional Chinese medicine, and 74 percent received an&#13;
analgesic or antipyretic. Of the 108 patients who received antibiotics, 10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
percent received kanamycin, 20 percent received gentamycin, 48 percent&#13;
received tetracyclJ57, 20 percent received penicillin, and 6 percent received&#13;
sulfamethaxazole.&#13;
For children affected with respiratory disease, timely use of&#13;
penicillin is crucial to the reduction of morbidity from complications of&#13;
pneumonia. However, casual use of antibiotics without appropriate indication&#13;
on the severity of the illness may lead to the appearance of drug-resistant&#13;
organisms.&#13;

VII. ISSUES&#13;
China over the last 30 years has established a sound infrastructure&#13;
of maternal child health services. Under limited resources, it made a firm&#13;
commitment to emphasize preventive health services, such as immunization&#13;
against childhood communicable diseases, and prenatal, intrapartum, and&#13;
postnatal services. In our review of the pattern of child mortality, we&#13;
notice that the trend in infant mortality is steadily decreasing. As changes&#13;
in the infant mortality rate are closely associated with the general economic&#13;
development of the population, we observe that China's accomplishment has&#13;
exceeded any expected level of improvement in health, considering its present&#13;
level of economic development.&#13;
The overall pattern of mortality in China is undergoing a gradual&#13;
transition: the percentage of total deaths secondary to chronic diseases,&#13;
such as cardiovascular disease and cancers, are increasing in the urbanized&#13;
areas, and the percentage of total deaths secondary to infectious, parasitic&#13;
diseases, although they still persist, are decreasing. Similarly, the&#13;
mortality reduction is also observed among children. About two-thirds of&#13;
infant deaths now occur during the neonatal period. The prevalence of chronic&#13;
disease, such as congenital defects, is rising, although the magnitude of the&#13;
problem is not comparable to the impact of respiratory diseases. The&#13;
morbidity pattern, however, is still mainly due to infectious diseases.&#13;
The improvement attained in child health care has been remarkable;&#13;
however, these achievements are not satisfactory under the one child per&#13;
family policy. The "one child is best" norm was approved by the State Council&#13;
and formally endorsed in 1978 by the Central Committee of the Chinese&#13;
Communist Party. The one child campaign was launched in early 1979. The call&#13;
in 1979 for the "one child per family" was an attempt to avoid the potential&#13;
resurgence of a second baby boom. The cohort of the "baby boom" of the late&#13;
1960s is now entering childbearing ages. The increase in the absolute numbers&#13;
of couples as a result of the first baby boom would lead to a significant&#13;
increase in the population, even with a population policy of two children per&#13;
couple.&#13;
A. The One Child Family Policy&#13;
A major issue in child health care stems from the consequences of the&#13;
one child family policy. Premier Hua Guofeng stated "The State demands that&#13;
each couple should ideally have only one child and not more th8n two. To&#13;
produce a third child is to violate the state regulations." _1     There are&#13;
varied incentives and disincentives to encourage couples of child-bearing age&#13;
to pledge to have only one child. As an incentive, couples who sign the "one&#13;
child certificate" are entitled to benefits in health care, housing, food&#13;

Beijing, June 18, 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
allowances, and work assignments. The disincentives for couples who have more&#13;
than two children also vary from place to place. For example, in some areas&#13;
the medical care cost of the first child is free (paid for by the state or the&#13;
parent's workplace), and the medical care cost of any child beyond two&#13;
children must be paid by the parents. Another form of disincentive is through&#13;
restricting the number of children from a single family who can attend&#13;
university simultaneously. Annex table 24 summarizes the incentives and the&#13;
disincentives used in China's population strategy.&#13;
The intensive campaign for population limitation in China is directed&#13;
to the ethnic Chinese population, the Han people, who comprise 94 percent of&#13;
the population (about 937 million people). The remaining 66 million people&#13;
are 'national minorities'. For these minority groups the population policy is&#13;
different. The policy encourages population increase; however, family&#13;
planning is provided to those who want to limit the number of their children.&#13;
Better health as part of an improved population policy has become&#13;
important with the one child family program. Couples restricted to one child&#13;
want and need extra reassurance that the child will be healthy. Guaranteeing&#13;
healthy babies implies a need to improve prenatal as well as postnatal care.&#13;
There is strong pressure at the county level to establish genetic screening&#13;
services for early identification of congenital defects, in order to reassure&#13;
the quality of the pregnancy outcome. Prenatal diagnosis and screening&#13;
programmes at birth for treatable or preventable diseases become, therefore,&#13;
essential components of maternal and child care services.&#13;
The state of the fetus can be directly assessed from an anatomical&#13;
viewpoint by ultrasonography, and at the cellular level by examining the&#13;
amniotic fluid by biochemical and cytological techniques. An amniocentesis&#13;
for the diagnosis of chromosomal and inherited biochemical ahnormalities is&#13;
ideally undertaken during the sixteenth week of pregnancv, because the volume&#13;
of fluid is then sufficiently large to reduce the risk of inducing the&#13;
miscarriage of a normal fetus to about 1 percent. Amniotic fluid should be&#13;
examined for diagnosis of inborn error of metabolism, for alpha-fetoprotein in&#13;
order to diagnose an unsuspected open neural tube defect, and for chromosomal&#13;
abnormalities. It should be aimed at a selective population which is at high&#13;
risk for certain diseases based on genetic, geographical and clinical grounds.&#13;
In many county level MCH centers, the health staff, under the&#13;
increased demands of the community for eugenics screening, is attempting to&#13;
set up genetics laboratories. With limited resources, uniform quality&#13;
standards are difficult to achieve. Chromosomal mapping, cell culture, and&#13;
detailed biochemical analysis techniques require advanced technical training&#13;
and sophisticated laboratory tools. Such services can be most efficiently&#13;
utilized if established at prefectural or provincial level, and if high-risk&#13;
couples with family histories of congenital defects are referred from the&#13;
counties for genetic screening at the regional centers. To divert the time of&#13;
the health staff in the county MCH centers from direct patient care to&#13;
laboratory analysis would be inefficient and non-efficacious.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Similarly, improved screening for perinatal risks is needed. There&#13;
is a need to use standard fetal monitoring to assist in the early detection of&#13;
fetal distress and for timely management of high-risk infants. In order to&#13;
reduce perinatal mortality, regular prenatal care should begin early in&#13;
pregnancy. In the urban areas, prenatal care begins at 3 to 6 months of&#13;
pregnancy, and the woman is examined once a month. After 7 months of&#13;
pregnancy, she is examined every two weeks. In the rural areas, basic&#13;
knowledge about prenatal care is becoming more widespread, and increasingly&#13;
more pregnant women begin their care as soon as the pregnancy is confirmed.&#13;
Most of the prenatal care is provided by BFDs; some pregnant women go to the&#13;
commune health center for care.&#13;
Pregnant women with high-risk conditions, such as eclampsia or&#13;
intrauterine growth retardation, can be referred to the county level health&#13;
care facilities for closer monitoring and prompt obstetrical management in&#13;
collaboration with assistance from the pediatric staff who will provide care&#13;
to the high-risk neonate.&#13;
Extrauterine monitoring of the fetal heart rate can diagnose&#13;
conditions leading to fetal distress such as placental insufficiency, nuchal&#13;
umbilical cord, or prolapse of the umbilical cord. However, training of&#13;
health staff is required to ensure competent interpretation of the diagnostic&#13;
findings.&#13;
Comprehensiveness of prenatal care activities may vary according to&#13;
urban and rural conditions. The rural areas, based on the limitations of&#13;
their resources, may aim to (a) strengthen health education on potential&#13;
consequences of consanguineous marriage, benefits of prenatal care, and proper&#13;
maternal dietary intakes; (b) strengthen outreach services to increase the&#13;
coverage of prenatal care to pregnant women; and (c) increase coverage of&#13;
'scientific' deliveries. In Heilongjiang, the requirements of a 'scientific'&#13;
delivery are to monitor stages of the labor, to use sterile tools and gloves,&#13;
and to apply mercurichrome on the perineal area prior to delivery. Although&#13;
in China the overall rate of 'scientific' delivery is over 90 percent, there&#13;
is still a wide variation in rural areas. Many factors, such as different&#13;
cultural practices among the national minorities, home deliveries, inadequate&#13;
training of midwives or birth attendants, and lack of sterile tools, all&#13;
contribute to the relatively higher maternal and neonatal morbidity rates in&#13;
rural areas, especially in geographically remote or in poorer socioeconomic&#13;
regions.&#13;
There is also a need to strengthen neonatal care and to establish a&#13;
high-risk neonatal transfer transport system. The perinatal mortality rate&#13;
ranges from 9.3 to 122.5 deaths per 1,000 live births. Such a wide variation&#13;
may be due to difference in reporting; however, they also reflect urban-rural&#13;
differences in quality of health facilities. The best single indicator of the&#13;
quality of perinatal care may be the risk of death among the heavier&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
infants. The rate is higher in Shanghai than the rate in California. 39/ The&#13;
county health centers lack equipment and staff to adequately manage high-risk&#13;
infants. There is a need for monitoring and resuscitation of high-risk&#13;
neonates during transport from local health centers to a regional health&#13;
facility which is equipped with an intensive care unit.&#13;
China has put her priorities in the past on prevention, with curative&#13;
medical care universally available but basic. China has established a well-&#13;
developed health care infrastructure; her next major task, especially under&#13;
the one child policy, is to improve the sophistication in the technology of&#13;
perinatal care, such as updating equipment and facilities for resuscitation&#13;
and intensive care of sick infants. The rural counties have simple&#13;
incubators, but more complex equipment is notably absent.&#13;
B. Integration of MCH Services&#13;
The lack of integration of curative and preventive services for&#13;
mothers and children is another major issue. Under the three-tiered health&#13;
care system, the obstetrics and gynecology and the pediatrics departments of&#13;
the county general hospitals offer curative services. The county epidemic&#13;
prevention station organizes immunization activities, and the county MCH&#13;
station provides a mixture of preventive and curative services. As a result&#13;
of this fragmentation, there is a duplication of services. MCH services at&#13;
the county level provide obstetrical services in addition to preventive&#13;
services such as prenatal care and well baby care. Therefore, MCH services&#13;
increasingly duplicate curative services already available in the county&#13;
hospital. This emphasis on curative activities inevitably reduces the MCH's&#13;
allocation of financial and manpower resources for preventive services, and do&#13;
not improve the quality of services available to the population.&#13;
Furthermore, there is a possibility that the BFDs may abandon the&#13;
preventive aspects of the MCH services. Before the introduction of the&#13;
responsibility system, rural basic health care was mainly financed out of the&#13;
collective welfare fund; at present, services are provided on a fee-for-&#13;
service basis. Because preventive services yield few immediate results as&#13;
compared to curative care, patients may be reluctant to pay for them, and BFDs&#13;
may become less willing to provide these services because the monetary return&#13;
is low, relative to curative services. The BFDs' activities in Qufu county,&#13;
ShandoM Province, were measured quantitatively with work study techniques in&#13;
1982. -    The results indicated that on a daily average, a BFD spent only 3&#13;
percent of his time, out of a six-hour observational period, on preventive&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
activities. Only 5 minutes were devoted to maternal child care and family&#13;
planning.&#13;
The administrative organization of family planning services is&#13;
branching off to become a new, independent vertical structure. This trend&#13;
directly results from the promotion of the State Family Planning Commission in&#13;
1983 to a ministerial level authority, which indicates the high priority that&#13;
is given by the State Council to the tasks of the population program. This&#13;
new situation calls for the creation of independent delivery services under&#13;
direct line authority. The Birth Planning Commission of the State Council&#13;
sets population policies. The commission is backed up by the State Birth&#13;
Planning Office, which supervises activities throughout the country. At the&#13;
provincial level, a birth plannning committee sets implementation plans and&#13;
organizes mass media campaigns. At the county level, county birth planning&#13;
offices supply contraceptives to the rural communes and production brigades.&#13;
There is also a birth planning leadership group at the commune level, and&#13;
another at the brigade level, that supervises the BFDs who deliver&#13;
contraceptives to brigade members. It is only at the brigade level that&#13;
services are fully integrated. The separation of a different administrative&#13;
hierarchy for family planning services, in addition to MCH services,&#13;
duplicates many activities provided by health personnel. The resultant lack&#13;
of continuity of care reduces the efficiency and efficacy of the services&#13;
offered.&#13;
There is a need to coordinate the existing fragmented services for&#13;
mothers and children which are now provided from various sources: the county&#13;
MCH center, the epidemic prevention station, the county hospital (pediatric,&#13;
obstetrical, and gynecological departments), and the county birth planning&#13;
office. The efficacy of these services could be greatly enhanced if they&#13;
could be organized under one leading group with the responsibility of&#13;
maintaining a balance of curative and preventive services provided by the&#13;
different organizations.&#13;
C. Improvement of Immunization Coverage&#13;
A third major issue is the improvement of immunization coverage. A&#13;
very high percentage of children are being immunized, and a sharp decrease in&#13;
the incidence of communicable diseases is the best evidence for the tremendous&#13;
administrative and manpower efforts dedicated to the immunization&#13;
activities. Problems, however, do still exist. Remarkable efforts in the&#13;
organization of mass campaigns, and prompt delivery of vaccines, have been&#13;
invested to compensate for an inadequate cold chain system. However, the&#13;
production of good quality vaccines is just as important as the issue of&#13;
vaccine storage and transport, and the logistics of giving the vaccines to the&#13;
target population.&#13;
There are five important issues in immunization activities. First,&#13;
the production of vaccines is ineffective and outdated. Measles and BCG are&#13;
not available in freeze-dried form. The liquid product has a short potency&#13;
duration (43 days), as compared with 2 years of the freeze-dried products.&#13;
The equipment for vaccine production needs to be improved to reach&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
international standards. There is a need for freeze drying equipment to&#13;
enhance the life span of vaccine products now produced in China. There is a&#13;
need for quality control during production to ensure safety of the vaccines,&#13;
both in terms of avoiding contamination by microorganisms and in ensuring&#13;
proper attenuation of live viruses; and there is also a need for improvement&#13;
of the packaging of the final product form. For example, polio vaccine is&#13;
presently encapsulated in candies, which are bulky and difficult to transport&#13;
in ice boxes.&#13;
Second, wastage is enormous. Recent surveys estimate that the&#13;
wastage ratio is 2.5 to 3, which means that the amount of vaccine ordered is&#13;
3 times the number of actual planned doses. Some reasons for wastage are&#13;
short duration of vaccine potency, poor cold chain, and inadequate product&#13;
packaging. Vaccines are packaged in large vials (100 or more doses per vial),&#13;
which inevitably leads to wastage in the decentralized delivery system.&#13;
Vaccines could be optimally utilized if smaller vials (5 to 10 doses per vial)&#13;
were distributed to the brigades, since the number of recipients per brigade&#13;
is small.&#13;
Third, the immunization schedules are inadequate. In general, mass&#13;
vaccination campaigns are organized once a year. Those children who do not&#13;
reach the eligible age at the time of the vaccination, or who are ill at the&#13;
time of the campaign, or are absent for other reasons, will not receive the&#13;
vaccination, and hence are susceptible to contracting the disease. For&#13;
measles vaccination the annual interval is not desirable. A high proportion&#13;
of infants who are too young at the time of the annual vaccination campaign&#13;
will be at high risk, susceptible to contracting the infection before the next&#13;
vaccination campaign. In order to further reduce morbidity, a more frequent&#13;
vaccination schedule, such as quarterly campaigns, would be required to&#13;
improve the coverage of infants and to reach the target group of infants of 9&#13;
to 12 month of age.&#13;
Fourth, cold chain equipment is inadequate. There is a lack of&#13;
equipment for a more effective cold chain, such as refrigerators, cold boxes,&#13;
and vaccine temperature-monitoring devices. The problem of the cold chain is&#13;
evidenced by the continuing high prevalence of diseases such as measles,&#13;
despite high reported immunization coverage. Temperature monitoring is&#13;
crucial during transport and storage of the vaccines.&#13;
Fifth, the development of a recording, reporting, and feedback system&#13;
for immunization activities, and morbidity and mortality data is needed.&#13;
Training of personnel, such as those individuals involved in&#13;
administering vaccines, maintaining the cold chain, or driving a vehicle for&#13;
vaccine transport, and training of a new generation of technical staff in&#13;
vaccine production and quality control are crucial to enhance further&#13;
improvement in the outcome of the immunization activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
D. Additional Training&#13;
There is a need to strengthen the technical skills of MCH staff at&#13;
all levels. Appropriate diagnosis and management of illnesses is crucial to&#13;
reducing morbidity and mortality. For example, pneumonia accounts for one-&#13;
third of the causes of child morbidity. Childhood respiratory infections are&#13;
mainly of viral etiology. However, complications with the development of&#13;
bacterial pneumonia carry high fatality rates, especially in infants. The&#13;
BFDs and the health staff at the commune level must be trained to recognize&#13;
the severity of illnesses, and to be aware of indications for timely referral&#13;
of patients to a higher level. Decision trees or flow charts are crucial in&#13;
assisting BFDs to manage prevalent illnesses such as respiratory infections.&#13;
Under the one child family policy, emphasis is placed on optimizing&#13;
pregnancy outcome, and fetal monitoring can assist the early recognition of&#13;
fetal distress. However, training of health staff to appropriately recognize&#13;
signs of fetal distress is crucial to avoid the overzealous performance of&#13;
invasive procedures such as C-section deliveries, which is a procedure not&#13;
totally risk free.&#13;
E. Closing Network Service Gaps&#13;
There is also a need to fill the service gaps present in the health&#13;
care network. There is no routine monitoring of growth and development.&#13;
Special nutritional surveys indicate that moderate malnutrition still persists&#13;
in China; however, monitoring of the nutritional status of children is not&#13;
routinely performed. Early diagnosis of growth faltering and management of&#13;
failure-to-thrive infants is crucial to maximize the full growth potential of&#13;
each child. The BFDs should be trained to regularly weigh infants and to use&#13;
weight charts for each child. At present, annual height and weight records&#13;
are kept in the brigade health stations. However, the practice of recording&#13;
weight and height is often a self-limited exercise. Actions are not taken to&#13;
identify growth faltering in individual children. Assessments of children's&#13;
development are seldom performed by the primary level health workers. This&#13;
activity has been emphasized only since the launch of the one child policy.&#13;
The basic techniques in development screening should be incorporated into the&#13;
training curriculum of health workers to enable them to provide early&#13;
identification of children with developmental delays and problems, and to&#13;
refer them for more professional assessment.&#13;
There is a decreasing emphasis on sanitation services. The current&#13;
emphasis on improving quality of services applies largely to curative care.&#13;
In the past 30 years, through community mobilization, a major effort has been&#13;
placed on improvement of environmental hygiene. There has been drastic&#13;
improvement in general sanitation . However, the emphasis seems not to have&#13;
been maintained recently. The BFDs are spending only a very small proportion&#13;
of their time on preventive activities. There is no longer a full-time staff&#13;
at the commune health stations with responsibilities for sanitation.&#13;
Environmental and water pollution are the key contributing factors to fecal-&#13;
borne diseases, such as dysentery, ascaris, hookworm, and hepatitis, which are&#13;
still major health problems in China. With the introduction of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
responsibility system, individual households may intensify their use of human&#13;
excreta as fertilizers. Concurrently, as the collective agricultural system&#13;
collapses after the introduction of the responsibility system, the communal&#13;
sanitation system for collection, conservation, and composting of excreta may&#13;
also be collapsing. This may lead to a worsening of environmental pollution,&#13;
which in turn may lead to higher prevalence of fecal-borne diseases. Public&#13;
health officials need to allocate special resources to maintain environmental&#13;
sanitation. Regular inspections of water should be strengthened . Health&#13;
education should also be strengthened to increase the awareness of the&#13;
peasants of agricultural sanitation.&#13;
F. The Reporting System&#13;
Another major issue is the strengthening of the reporting and&#13;
surveillance system. The prospects for complete notification of diseases are&#13;
excellent, since the organization of health services enables a complete&#13;
coverage of the population, both rural and urban areas. Existing literature&#13;
to date indicate that many surveys have been conducted by health institutions&#13;
on the morbidity and mortality pattern of children; however, there is no&#13;
indication on the representativeness of the population from the sample&#13;
surveyed. Underreporting is a significant problem in the data on mortality&#13;
and morbidity. There is a wide variation in the extent of underreporting from&#13;
province to province. Poor validity in reporting is inevitable, since&#13;
standardized case definitions have not been developed, and there is no&#13;
evidence of a manual outlining surveillance and investigation procedures. In&#13;
order to improve the validity and the quality of the data, there is a great&#13;
need for training of those health staff at all levels who are involved in the&#13;
reporting of deaths and diseases.&#13;
G. Continuing Presence of Malnutrition&#13;
The final issue is the strengthening of strategies to address the&#13;
continuing presence of malnutrition. The assessment of the nutritional status&#13;
of children is the ultimate test of health and food policies.&#13;
Secular improvement in anthropometric status is noted, even though&#13;
the caloric availability per capita in China increased by only about 1 percent&#13;
between 1957 and 1977. The key contributing factors were the elimination of&#13;
maldistribution of food and the health sector's promotion of a preventive&#13;
approach to diseases. China's agriculture has progressed from mobilization of&#13;
labor for increased production to increased use of fertilizer to&#13;
mechanization. To ensure adequate dietary energy intake, efforts to increase&#13;
production is complemented by a careful control on consumption, that is,&#13;
equitable rationing, a process which has improved distribution and minimized&#13;
food wastage.&#13;
The effectiveness of the health care system in contributing to the&#13;
improvement of nutrition is largely the result of its accessibility and an&#13;
emphasis on prevention: sanitation, immunization, and prenatal and postnatal&#13;
care. There has been a steady secular improvement in the nutritional status&#13;
of children in China. A comparison of the growth of Chinese children with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
that of other developinng countries (such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, Togo, and&#13;
Liberia) also showed that the rates of stunting in China are lower.&#13;
The results of various nutritional assessments, however, indicate&#13;
that there remains a substantial amount of mild to moderate malnutrition.&#13;
Furthermore, there are distinct regional and urban-rural differences in the&#13;
extent of malnutrition.&#13;
Comprehensive surveys that link the anthropometric status of a child&#13;
with his food consumption are not available in China. The results of a&#13;
nutritional survey in urban nurseries in Beijing showed that the nutritional&#13;
quality of the diet provided by these institutions seemed to be reasonable,&#13;
since 13 percent of the total caloric intake was from protein and 25 percent&#13;
of the total intake was from fat. The amount of animal and legume protein was&#13;
about 55 percent of the total protein intake. However, the intake of calories&#13;
and protein was only about 62 percent of.the standard quantity provided. The&#13;
intake of micronutrients was also below standards; calcium was abwyl 34&#13;
percent, vitamin A was 59 percent, and vitamin C was 58 percent. -&#13;
Although acute signs of protein deficiency (such as kwashiorkor) are&#13;
not observed, there may be a substantial degree of subclinical protein&#13;
deficiency. This is supported by observation of a high prevalence of anemia&#13;
among children.&#13;
Over the last 30 years, China has addressed aggressively the key&#13;
issue of coverage, both in terms of food distribution and accessibility of&#13;
health services. In addition to maintaining its political commitment to&#13;
nutritional issues, the government needs to respond to the findings of the&#13;
nutritional surveys by setting up corrective programs. It is not possible,&#13;
however, to make recommendations with regard to the types of corrective&#13;
programs that are needed without analyzing the underlying reasons.&#13;
Malnutrition can be caused by many factors, some of them synergistic. The&#13;
high prevalence of parasitism, acute respiratory or gastrointestinal&#13;
infections, and dysfunction in family dynamics (an emerging problem as a&#13;
result of the 'one child norm'), are only a few possible contributing factors.&#13;
Improving the quality of nutrient intake, strengthening health&#13;
surveillance, early detection of those at risk, and active diagnosis and&#13;
treatment of malnourished children, all deserve to be high priority components&#13;
of the health care service delivery system. Maximizing a child's growth is&#13;
the most effective way to reassure the family and the society. A child that&#13;
grows well closely determines the acceptance and the viability of the present&#13;
one child family policy.&#13;

Note:  Diagnosis for severity of paralysis from polio was based on grading muscle&#13;
strength, in addition to presence of muscle atrophy in all the cases. The&#13;
frequency distribution of paralysis grade 0-4 was as follows:&#13;
Grade 0-1   (total to near total paralysis)              14.0%&#13;
Grade 2     (no strength against gravity)                18.6%&#13;
Grade 3     (presence of strength against gravity&#13;
but not against resistance)               31.3%&#13;
Grade 4     (presence of strength against resistance)    36.1%&#13;

Source:  Based on estimates of children's weight for height calculated from&#13;
data collected by MOPH in a 1975 survey of nine cities.&#13;
Notes: (i)   'Stunting' is defined in terms of a child having low height for his&#13;
age; specifically a child is defined as stunted if his height is&#13;
less than 901 of the median height for children of that age&#13;
according to the NCHS standard. Nutritionists regard stunting as&#13;
the appropriate measure for chronic (but not necessarily severe)&#13;
malnutrition.&#13;
(ii)  The national urban areas for which data are reported in this table&#13;
are from a survey of nine cities - three in northern China, three in&#13;
central China, and three in the south. The suburban areas are ones&#13;
located just outside these nine cities; they are, therefore,&#13;
probably somewhat better off than typical rural areas. The data&#13;
from urban Beijing are from the same survey.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This paper reviews the existing data,
            mainly Chinese publications, on childhood diseases in order
            to assess the health status &amp; morbidity patterns of
            Chinese children. China's infant mortality rate is
            among the very lowest in the developing world. The number of
            post-neonatal deaths as a proportion of total infant death
            has decreased to a level comparable to a developed country.
            The epidemiologic pattern of vaccine preventable diseases
            indicates that immunization activities have had a
            significant impact on the occurrence of these diseases. The
            overall prevalence of infectious diseases is decreasing and,
            relatively, the frequency of congenital defects is
            increasing as a major cause of childhood mortality. However,
            fecal-borne diseases such as dysentery, hepatitis, &amp;
            ascariasis are still the predominant causes of morbidity. A
            secular improvement in the nutritional status of Chinese
            children is noted, but mild to moderate malnutrition still
            persists. This review looks at: the impact of the one-child
            family policy, which is creating different demands on the
            maternal &amp; child health care service network;
            technological shortcomings in immunization activities, which
            are affecting coverage; the lack of better technical
            training, which is influencing health reporting &amp;
            surveillance systems.
