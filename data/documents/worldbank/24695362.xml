             services receiving public funds. Of course,    development on a large scale will take time&#13;
             we have the right to complain about issues     as there are many remaining deï¬&#129;ciencies in&#13;
             of quality regarding public services. Any      the legal and regulatory framework. There&#13;

             that tax payer money is used efï¬&#129;ciently        and political factors. In any case, it is clear&#13;
             and transparently. While efforts continue      that improving the public sectorâ&#128;&#153;s capacity&#13;
             to improve quality and efï¬&#129;ciency of public     to deliver will require improved efï¬&#129;ciency&#13;
             services, all of us have to do our share and   in public spending, as well as higher tax&#13;

             to ï¬&#129;nancial markets remains limited. One       for the money it is receiving. It is only&#13;
             option would be to rely more on the private    when these basic conditions are met that&#13;

             Paying taxes lies at the heart of the             equivalent of approximately 12 percent&#13;
             ï¬&#129;scal contract between the State and its          of GDP. The low level of tax revenue&#13;
             citizens. It is an individual decision for        collection reï¬&#130;ects systemic issues in policy&#13;
             each taxpayer who will balance her or his         and administration. It also has serious&#13;
             incentives and costs to comply with the           implications   for    Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s   economic&#13;
             law. It is also a collective decision that will   future. Tax revenues are currently too low to&#13;

             capacity to deliver public goods, including       necessary, public investment program. At&#13;
             infrastructure and social services. There         the same time, other sources of ï¬&#129;nancing&#13;
             is no blue print on how to balance these          are increasingly limited, particularly with&#13;
             decisions as tax collection efforts and           the decline in the value of aid inï¬&#130;ows and&#13;
             policy vary signiï¬&#129;cantly around the world,        with the limited availability of loans from&#13;
             even between countries with similar               the private sector.&#13;
             income levels.&#13;
                                                               All countries need to secure a source&#13;
             A set of simple rules, based on common            of funding to ï¬&#129;nance their economic&#13;
             sense, can be used to evaluate the quality        development. While governments may&#13;
             of a tax system. First, the system should         access a range of different sources of&#13;
             be perceived as fair, affordable and              funding, depending on the role of State&#13;
             transparent by taxpayers. Second, the level       and the availability of alternative sources&#13;
             of tax revenues should be sufï¬&#129;cient for           of funding in each economy, raising tax&#13;
             the State to satisfy the current and future       revenues is unavoidable for all except,&#13;
             needs of its citizens. On both of these two       perhaps, a small handful of extremely&#13;
             counts, Tanzania might not be passing the         resource rich states. In light of recent&#13;
             bar.                                              economic developments and in light of&#13;
                                                               the growing demand for infrastructure and&#13;
             In spite of progress during the late              social services, it appears that Tanzania&#13;
             2000s, the current level of tax revenues          must make signiï¬&#129;cantly greater efforts to&#13;
             in Tanzania remains extremely low, at the         improve its tax collection performance.&#13;

             impact negatively on the countryâ&#128;&#153;s trade        the 2000s, the Government was able to&#13;
             balance. For example, given Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s          increase the real value of its spending by&#13;
             position as a net exporter of gold and a        an average of approximately 13 percent&#13;
             net importer of oil, the economy would          per year, with these increases being made&#13;
             doubtless suffer as a result of lower gold      possible by sustained growth in the value of&#13;
             prices combined with higher oil prices.         external aid and by improved tax collection.&#13;
             Regional instability could also have a          The subsequent deceleration in these two&#13;

             neighboring countries and on the tourism        with these expenditures increasing by an&#13;
             industry. Sustained low energy prices on        average annual rate of only three percent&#13;
             world markets could affect the decision of      in the period from 2010/11 and 2013/14.&#13;

                                                      solution is to simplify the system. Tanzania&#13;
Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s need for funds is projected to&#13;

Thus, Tanzania, like other low-income                 Once transaction costs are reduced, tax&#13;

However, even countries with high rates of            activities and so increase the number of&#13;

between the state and citizens. A recent              countries but should be carefully evaluated&#13;
survey indicates that many Tanzanians are             given the risk for the Tanzanian Government&#13;
reluctant to pay taxes because they see               of losing tax revenues in the short-term.&#13;

                      Part I: The State of the Economy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       Â&#132;   In spite of volatile world commodity prices and increasing ï¬&#129;scal pressures, Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                           economy remains strong, with relatively rapid growth (7 percent); low inï¬&#130;ation&#13;
                           (around 5 percent); and a stable current account deï¬&#129;cit.&#13;
&#13;
                       Â&#132;   However, the Government has had to reduce its expenditure by the equivalent&#13;
                           of approximately two percent of GDP relative to the level approved in its 2014/15&#13;
                           budget. The Government also needs to address signiï¬&#129;cant accumulated arrears&#13;
                           with contractors and pension funds. It should aim to achieve this by injecting funds&#13;
                           and issuing bonds.&#13;
&#13;
                       Â&#132;   Prospects for the economy in the short to medium term remain positive. However,&#13;
                           the Government must remain committed to ï¬&#129;scal sustainability and monetary&#13;
                           prudence. With the national elections scheduled for October 2015, this may become&#13;
                           increasingly challenging.&#13;
&#13;
                       Â&#132;   The gradual decline in the value of aid inï¬&#130;ows and the weaker tax collection&#13;
                           performance have led to a sharp decrease in the expansion of real public expenditure.&#13;
                           The growth rate of expenditure has declined from an average of 13 percent per year&#13;
                           during the 2000s to 3 percent since 2010/11. The Government must ï¬&#129;nd new ways&#13;
                           to ï¬&#129;nance vitally necessary economic development. One means by which it may&#13;
                           achieve this is through improved tax revenue collection.&#13;

                             Box 1: The pulse of the economy&#13;
&#13;
 The views of the business managers of the top 100 mid-sized companies in Tanzania&#13;
 have been collected every six months since April 2013. This data is collected by KPMG&#13;
 through electronic questionnaires and responses are anonymous. As of May 2015, only&#13;
 one third of managers evaluate that the economy is performing better this year than&#13;
 last year, while up to 43 percent report deterioration. Looking forward, only one-third&#13;
 are optimistic for the economy and their own businesses.&#13;
&#13;
 How do you believe the Tanzanian economy is performing compared to last year?&#13;

                                                     performed better in the last 12 months&#13;

                                                     9 percent between December 2014&#13;
                                                     and May 2015.&#13;

                                                     against 55 percent in November 2013.&#13;

                                                Â&#132;    As of May 2015, one-third of managers&#13;
                                                     anticipated a deterioration of the&#13;
                                                     economic performance over the next&#13;

In this context, the resilience of the                    imports accounting for approximately 15&#13;

Second,         the   decline     in    oil   prices      reduced the impact on local prices.4 The                  budget. Most taxes&#13;

other hand, lower imported oil prices will                shipping and contracting times. Second,&#13;
reduce the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s own energy                        a specific price formula (including a&#13;

     While there had been a sharp increase in real expenditures in 2012/13, it was realized at the expense of a larger&#13;
     ï¬&#129;scal deï¬&#129;cit (the Government missed its ï¬&#129;scal target by almost one percent of GDP). If targets were met in&#13;
     2012/13, the real increase in expenditures would have been only 7 percent instead of the reported 17 percent.&#13;
11&#13;
     The share of LGA budgets allocated to non-salary recurrent spending has continued to decline in the 2014/15&#13;
     budget. Only around 10 percent of the LGAs budget is projected to be spent on non-salary recurrent spending,&#13;
     which is less than half of what was spent in 2009/10 and 2010/11.&#13;

                     Part II: Why Tanzanians should be&#13;
                     paying taxes&#13;
&#13;
                          Â&#132;    Tanzania collected approximately USD 6 billion worth of revenues in 2013/14. This&#13;
                               covers almost three-quarters of government expenditures. However, this is not&#13;
                               enough, particularly when other sources of funding, such as aid, are declining and&#13;
                               when the Government has limited access to loans and private sector ï¬&#129;nance. As&#13;
                               the population grows, the demand for public services will only increase. Put simply,&#13;
                               Tanzania must collect more taxes.&#13;
                          Â&#132;    Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s tax system relies on a combination of VAT, income tax, import duties and&#13;
                               excise tax. Reliance on these four main taxes is not unusual in low income countries.&#13;
                               However, Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s performance in the area of the collection of VAT is one of the&#13;
                               worst in the world.&#13;
                          Â&#132;    Tax collection is very concentrated, with revenues derived primarily from only a few&#13;
                               sectors and from the Dar-es-Salaam region. In addition, compliance costs are high.&#13;
                          Â&#132;    The Government must implement a series of bold and innovative actions, in&#13;
                               addition to the traditional administrative measures, to make the current tax system&#13;
                               affordable, fair and transparent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     Robert does not pay taxes. â&#128;&#156;Why should                       necessary public services or to redistribute&#13;

                         easy to ï¬&#129;nd as policymakers have to account for both â&#128;&#156;marketâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;governmentâ&#128;&#157; failures&#13;

This rapid description of the Tanzanian                     for developing countries, efforts need&#13;
tax system reveals the major weakness                       to be made to diversify the tax base. In&#13;
of the system, which is that the level                      geographical terms, the region of Dar es&#13;
of compliance is very weak, with                            Salaam accounts for approximately 90&#13;
low yields in the collection of VAT                         percent of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s tax revenues,&#13;
and import duties. If overall revenue                       despite the fact that it accounts for only&#13;
collection is analyzed in terms of region                   17 percent of the total value of GDP&#13;
and sector, a second weakness becomes                       (see Figure 22). This means that both&#13;
apparent. Tax collection is concentrated                    important sectors of the economy and&#13;
in only a few sectors and in one location,                  regions that contribute significantly to&#13;
Dar es Salaam. Large enterprises (400                       GDP, including secondary cities, have&#13;

                               Box 3: The cost of a misunderstood VAT&#13;
&#13;
 Letâ&#128;&#153;s assume that a medium sized trader sells USD 100 worth of fabric to a successful&#13;
 merchant in Upanga.25 The payment value would be USD 118 to account for the VAT of 18&#13;
 percent that will be paid to TRA. Subsequently, the merchant uses the fabric for t-shirts&#13;
 that will be sold at the market for a total value of USD 150 (excluding VAT). Eighteen                     The complexity&#13;
 percent of USD 150 is USD 27, so the ï¬&#129;nal price of these T-shirts will be USD 177.                         of the current tax&#13;
                                                                                                            system is partly&#13;
 The question is: How much VAT should the merchant pay to TRA?&#13;
                                                                                                            embedded in the&#13;
 If you respond USD 27, it means that you will be too generous and offer a gift of USD18                    fragmentation&#13;
 to TRA. In fact, you should subtract the earlier payment of USD 18 and pay only the&#13;
 difference of USD 9. VAT is only paid on the value added. The merchant should pay USD 9&#13;
                                                                                                            of the policy&#13;
 to TRA and the trader should pay USD 18 to TRA.                                                            decision process&#13;
                                                                                                            and management.&#13;
 In reality, many taxpayers are confused and will pay the total amount to TRA, without&#13;
 claiming the earlier credit. They may also not be able to claim their credit if they do not&#13;
 have a tax invoice for the ï¬&#129;rst transaction. Because the burden becomes very high, many&#13;
 traders might therefore decide not to pay the tax at all, choosing to evade the payment of&#13;
 taxation entirely. Small businesses, with an annual turnover below TZS 40 million, can opt&#13;
 to pay the presumptive tax (a lump sum payment determined by the size of the business)&#13;
 but they will be unable to claim back the VAT on inputs.&#13;
&#13;
The complexity of the tax system is                   and fees collected by public sector&#13;
further exacerbated by the excessive                  entities which are not clearly reported&#13;
application of exemptions. In 2013/14,                in the budget. While these charges might&#13;
the total value of lost revenue resulting             be invisible in the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s accounts,&#13;
from tax exemptions amounted to TZS                   they represent a signiï¬&#129;cant administrative&#13;
1,834 billion or 2.5 percent of revised GDP.          and ï¬&#129;nancial burden for private businesses.&#13;
The recent PER study on tax exemptions                For example, the recent lab organized by&#13;
has identiï¬&#129;ed more than 160 exemptions to             the Presidential Big Results Now initiative&#13;
current tax laws. This study recommended              has shown that tour operators are subject&#13;
that half of these should be removed or               to more than 25 charges and levies.&#13;

                                                      is partly embedded in the fragmentation&#13;

                          Box 4: Psychology is key in tax matters&#13;
&#13;
 Social norms have a signiï¬&#129;cant impact on behavior. This fact can be leveraged to make&#13;
 tax policy more effective, at little cost. Deciding whether or not to pay taxes is a social&#13;
 issue because individual and group interests are opposed: while each individual may&#13;
 strive to minimize their tax obligations, public goods can only be effectively provided&#13;
 if the majority pay. However, if a critical mass of Tanzanians start to pay taxes, evasion&#13;
 and non-compliance will no longer be socially acceptable. When this occurs, it is likely&#13;
 that peer group pressure will result in a higher level of compliance, with members of&#13;
 the public possibly reporting cases of non-compliance to the authorities and otherwise&#13;
 pressuring non-compliant peers to fulï¬&#129;ll their tax obligations.&#13;
&#13;
 A recent experiment has shown that changing the wording of letters sent to people&#13;
 asking them to pay outstanding taxes can have an impact. People receiving a letter&#13;
 telling them that 90 percent of taxpayers pay their taxes on time were much more&#13;
 likely to respond quickly than those sent a generic letter. If the letter also informed the&#13;
 taxpayer that they were in a minority by not paying on time, they were even more likely               The current tax&#13;
 to pay. Although this example comes from the UK, it does illustrate that psychology                   burden is highly&#13;
 plays a key role in compliance with taxation regimes.&#13;

&#13;
 The World Bank recently looked at a subset of twenty ï¬&#129;rms in Tanzania to assess whether&#13;
 tax incentives were beneï¬&#129;cial. Despite the small size of the sample, the evidence suggests&#13;
 that overall, tax exemptions are not a key determinant of business investment decisions in                         A number of&#13;
 Tanzania. For the majority of businesses, tax exemptions also do not appear to inï¬&#130;uence                            exemptions&#13;
 growth strategies. Furthermore, although the data is limited, it seems many ï¬&#129;rms have                              should also be&#13;
 fallen short of their expected targets which they have articulated to obtain tax exemptions.&#13;
                                                                                                                    eliminated, as&#13;
 In terms of employment gains, the message is mixed, with some ï¬&#129;rms generating sufï¬&#129;cient&#13;
 employment to justify the exemptions they receive.                                                                 these are not&#13;

 Unfortunately, the use of complex incentives is prone to abuse. Several studies have&#13;
                                                                                                                    the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

taxpayers understand their obligations and                   possibility is to use carrots to incentivize tax&#13;
to encourage them to pay by realigning                       payment. For example, some authorities&#13;
their incentives. Inspiration can be found                   have introduced tax lotteries as a means of&#13;

              Box 7: Prizes for paying taxes, can a lottery incentivize tax payment?&#13;
&#13;
 Due to asymmetry of information between the Government and the taxpayer, taxpayers&#13;
 may underreport the amount of taxes they owe. To balance this, the Government needs&#13;
 to devote signiï¬&#129;cant resources to monitoring and reporting economic activity. This&#13;
 problem has been examined in detail in China, where it is estimated that the size of the&#13;
 underground economy from 2000-1 was equivalent to approximately 13.4 percent of GDP.&#13;
 As an innovative means to overcome the problem, the Chinese government introduced a&#13;
 system where an ofï¬&#129;cial receipt is printed with a public lottery number. The receipt is not&#13;
 only an ofï¬&#129;cial receipt, but also a lottery ticket.&#13;
                                                                                                                       Rather, they must&#13;

 Governments across the world are taking measures to improve transparency on tax                                    step forwards&#13;
 issues. For example, tax transparency laws passed by the former Australian Labor&#13;
                                                                                                                    in terms of&#13;
 Party Government required the national tax ofï¬&#129;ce to publish details of the taxes paid by&#13;
 approximately 1,600 public and private companies with an annual turnover of USD 100                                achieving&#13;
 million or more from July 2015. Under the new laws, all details related to total income,                           higher levels of&#13;
 taxable income and income tax payable must be reported.                                                            transparency and&#13;
 In Tanzania, some companies are voluntarily publishing similar details. Vodacom Tanzania                           accountability.&#13;
 announced in February 2015 that it would publish details related to revenue, expenditure,&#13;
 investment, proï¬&#129;t statements and operational challenges. This sets a high standard for&#13;
 other Tanzanian companies to follow. It is clear that measures such as these play a strong&#13;
 role in building public perceptions that a particular business is a good corporate citizen,&#13;
 with companies that demonstrate transparency winning trust from the public, including&#13;
 customers and investors.&#13;

            Tanzania economic update : why should
            Tanzanians pay taxes? The unavoidable need to finance
            economic development
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This seventh economic update goes to the
            heart of one of the main challenges faced by Tanzania: how
            can the country finance its development? This is a
            fundamental question when aid is coming down as a proportion
            of a growing GDP, and as access to financial markets remains
            limited. Oneoption would be to rely more on the private
            sector to deliver education, health, roads, ports and
            electricity. This is possible as demonstrated by many such
            experiences around the world, and therefore this approach
            needs to be one important part of the solution to finance
            development. The argument presented in this economic update
            is that higher tax revenues will come only if a
            comprehensive approach is adopted. The tax system has to be
            affordable, fair, simple, and transparent. The government
            also has to be accountable for the money it is receiving. It
            is onlywhen these basic conditions are met that tax
            compliance will increase. Because a strong social contract
            between the State and its citizens is not yet sufficiently
            in place in Tanzania, a number of suggestions are proposed
            in the update, with the objective of stimulating debate on
            possibleapproaches to increase tax revenue.
