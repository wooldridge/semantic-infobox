Improving Water Services through&#13;
Competition&#13;
Mlichael Webb    Water sector reforms in recent years have concentrated on involving the private sector in the&#13;
antcd David      operation and management of monopoly water utilities. Much effort has gone into regulation to&#13;
Ehrhardt&#13;
stop utilities from abusing their monopoly power, but relatively little into considering ways to&#13;
reduce that monopoly power. This Note explains how to bring competitive pressures to bear in the&#13;
water industry. It shows that while it can be difficult to implement conventional product market&#13;
competition (in which two or more rival operators compete to sell water services to customers in&#13;
one area), this option should not be ruled out. Better, cheaper water services can also be achieved&#13;
by increasing the use of competition in purchasing inputs, relying on competitive bidding for the&#13;
right to supply an area, and benchmarking rival utilities in different areas.&#13;
Scope for competing products                a single network and competition between ver-&#13;
tically disaggregated retailers that share access&#13;
In principle there are four means of introducing   to a single network and purchase water from&#13;
product market competition: competing net-  competing bulk suppliers.&#13;

common carriage competition (table 1). The high   Opportunities for competitive supply include&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Water sector reforms in recent years
            have concentrated on involving the private sector in the
            operation and management of monopoly water utilities. Much
            effort has gone into regulation to stop utilities from
            abusing their monopoly power, but relatively little into
            considering ways to reduce that monopoly power. This Note
            explains how to bring competitive pressures to bear in the
            water industry. It shows that while it can be difficult to
            implement conventional product market competition, this
            option should not be ruled out. Better, cheaper water
            services can also be achieved by increasing the use of
            competition in purchasing inputs, relying on competitive
            bidding for the right to supply an area, and benchmarking
            rival utilities in different areas.
