Global Scaling Up Handwashing is a project by the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) focused on applying innovative&#13;
behavior change approaches to improve handwashing with soap behavior among women of reproductive age (ages 15â&#128;&#147;49)&#13;
and primary school-age children (ages 5â&#128;&#147;9). It was implemented by local and national governments with technical support&#13;
from WSP in four countries: Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. For more information, please visit www.wsp.org/&#13;

&amp;#12;III.             Data Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Detailed definitions of the handwashing measures are pro-      errors were calculated using robust error variances in the&#13;
vided in Annex 1: Supplemental Tables (Table S1).              log-binomial regression models. The events observed dur-&#13;
                                                               ing structured observation were divided into four catego-&#13;
All data analysis was conducted at the country level. Data     ries of critical events: fecal contact, food preparation, child&#13;
from the three countries included in this analysis were not    feeding, and eating. Fecal contact included defecation or&#13;
aggregated.                                                    toilet use of the caregiver, as well as contact with child feces.&#13;
&#13;
Agreement between the various rapid handwashing mea-           In Vietnam, only the primary caregiver was interviewed&#13;

For example, agreement between self-report of handwash-        caregivers were present in a participating household, each&#13;
ing with soap after defecation with observation of soap at     caregiver was interviewed. For the purposes of this analy-&#13;
the handwashing place near the toilet was assessed. Kappa      sis, it was not possible to ascertain which of the caregiv-&#13;
is considered a measure of â&#128;&#156;true agreement,â&#128;&#157; in that it de-    ers was observed during any single event in the structured&#13;
scribes agreement taking into account the agreement that       observation. Thus, the datasets of rapid handwashing mea-&#13;
would be expected to occur by chance. Because kappa scores     sures and structured observations were restricted. In Peru,&#13;
can be underestimated when the prevalence of one or more       structured observation events occurring in households with&#13;
of the conditions under study is high or low, prevalence-      multiple caregivers were excluded from the analyses. In&#13;
adjusted kappa scores were also calculated using previously    Senegal, given the potential for a large loss in the sample&#13;
described methods (Byrt et al. 1993). A number of authors      if households with two or three caregivers were removed,&#13;
have recommended different cut-offs for interpretation of      those events occurring in households with more than three&#13;
kappa scores, although many are overlapping (Szklo and         caregivers were excluded and a random number generator&#13;
Nieto 2007). This study used Altmanâ&#128;&#153;s cutoffs: poor agree-     in SAS version 9.2 (a commonly used statistical program)&#13;
ment (k Ï½ 0.2), fair (k Ï­ 0.2 to Ï½ 0.4), moderate (k Ï­ 0.4     was used to randomly choose one caregiverâ&#128;&#153;s responses in&#13;
to Ï½0.6), good (k Ï­ 0.6 to 0.8), and very good (k Õ&#134; 0.8        households with two or three caregivers listed.&#13;

Curtis describes habit as a learned, automated behavior that       with Observed Handwashing&#13;
is reinforced by cues (Curtis et al. 2011). The presence of        Self-reported measures have been shown to overestimate&#13;
soap and water at a location commonly used for handwash-           observed handwashing behavior in numerous countries&#13;

&#13;
Annex 1: Supplemental Tables&#13;
&#13;
 TABLE S1: DEFINITIONS OF HANDWASHING MEASURES&#13;
&#13;
 Presence of Soap Anywhere in the Home&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢ The indicator is defined as presence of at least one type of soap observed by the enumerator anywhere in the home.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Following observations of handwashing places, enumerators asked the household respondent to show soap typically&#13;
    used for washing hands, irrespective of where it was located in the home. All households that allowed observation of soap&#13;
    anywhere in the home are included in this analysis.&#13;
&#13;
 Presence of Soap and Water at a Fixed Handwashing Place Used Post-Defecation&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢ The indicator is defined as the presence of at least one type of soap observed by the enumerator at the handwashing place&#13;
    reportedly used after defecation.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Questions to describe the location of the handwashing place and materials observed at that place followed an introductory&#13;
    question regarding whether hands are usually washed after defecation. Households in which the respondents indicated&#13;
    washing hands after defecation, and where respondents allowed observation of the location of the handwashing place and&#13;
    the presence of soap and water at that place, were eligible for analysis.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Enumerators recorded whether the handwashing place was inside the toilet or cooking place, or elsewhere in the yard. In Peru&#13;
    and Senegal, if the handwashing place was located elsewhere in the yard, the distance from the toilet was recorded (&lt; 3 feet&#13;
    from the toilet, 3 to 10 feet from the toilet, more than 10 feet from the toilet). In Vietnam, if the handwashing place was located&#13;
    elsewhere in the yard, enumerators recorded distance in meters, but the precoded categories approximated the ones used in&#13;
    Peru and Senegal. Enumerators recorded the type of soap present at the handwashing place. In Peru and Senegal, the types&#13;
    of soap observed were beauty bar soap, multipurpose bar soap, and powder/detergent soap. In Vietnam, the types of soap&#13;
    observed were liquid soap, multipurpose bar soap, and powder/detergent soap. For the indicator, a household was considered&#13;
    as having soap at the handwashing place if at least one type of soap, irrespective of type, was present at the handwashing&#13;
    place. The presence of water was recorded at the handwashing place, irrespective of the type of device located therein.&#13;
&#13;
 Presence of Soap and Water at a Fixed Handwashing Place Used before Food Preparation&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢ The indicator is defined as the presence of at least one type of soap observed by the enumerator at the handwashing place&#13;
    reportedly used before food preparation.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Questions to describe the location of the handwashing place and materials observed at that place followed an introductory&#13;
    question regarding whether hands are usually washed before food preparation. Observations of soap and water were carried&#13;
    out if the handwashing place used before food preparation differed from the handwashing place used after defecation.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Households identified as eligible for this analysis were, first, those that showed a handwashing place used before food&#13;
    preparation that was distinct from the handwashing place used after defecation, and for which observation of the location,&#13;
    soap, and water were all completed. Also included in the analysis were those households in which the handwashing place&#13;
    used after defecation was located in the kitchen and was the same place used to wash hands before food preparation.&#13;
    Households in which the respondent indicated not usually washing hands before food preparation, or that had no specific&#13;
    place for washing hands before food preparation, were also added.&#13;
                                                                                                                              (continued)&#13;

      TABLE S1: (Continued)&#13;
&#13;
      Presence of Soap and Water at a Fixed Handwashing Place Used before Food Preparation&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Questions to describe the location of the handwashing place and materials observed at that place followed an introductory&#13;
         question regarding whether hands are usually washed before food preparation. All households in which the respondents&#13;
         indicated washing hands before food preparation were eligible for analysis, and where respondents allowed observation of&#13;
         the location of the handwashing place and the presence of soap and water at that place.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Enumerators recorded whether the handwashing place was inside the toilet or cooking place, or elsewhere in the yard.&#13;
         The distance of the handwashing place from the cooking place was recorded similarly to the distance from the toilet, as&#13;
         described above for the postdefecation handwashing place. Soap and water observations were also recorded similarly.&#13;
&#13;
      Cleanliness Index of Caregiver Hands (Index Based on Observation of Nails, Palms, and Fingerpads)&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ This is a nine-point index based on the enumeratorâ&#128;&#153;s observation of the cleanliness of the nails, palms, and fingerpads of&#13;
         individual caregivers. Each aspect of the hand was rated on a three-point scale, ranging from one point for visible dirt to&#13;
         three points for clean appearance. These points were totaled to compute the hand cleanliness index.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Caregivers who did not allow observation of one or more aspects of the hand were not included in the analysis of the&#13;
         cleanliness index. The distribution of the index scores among caregivers in the control arm is reported below. Caregivers&#13;
         were also dichotomized according to cleanliness, with an index of 7 or higher denoting â&#128;&#156;clean hands,â&#128;&#157; and an index score&#13;
         less than 7 denoting â&#128;&#156;unclean hands.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
      Self-Reported Handwashing with Soap at Critical Times during Previous Day&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ The indicator is defined as self-reported handwashing with soap at one of the four critical times during the previous day.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Individual caregivers were asked whether they had washed hands with soap at least once during the previous day (since the&#13;
         same time the day before the enumeratorâ&#128;&#153;s visit). If they reported washing hands, they were asked in an unprompted fashion&#13;
         about the context of when hands were washed with soap and all other times that hands were washed with soap during the&#13;
         previous day. Although information about a number of critical times was captured, those of principal interest are as follows:&#13;
         after fecal contact, before food preparation or cooking food, before eating, or before feeding a child.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Caregivers described as being alone at the time of the interview were included in the analysis, because the presence of&#13;
         others may have influenced caregiversâ&#128;&#153; responses to handwashing questions.&#13;
&#13;
      Observed Handwashing with Soap at Critical Times&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Structured observation data can be analyzed and reported in numerous ways. Here, handwashing behavior was analyzed&#13;
         at the caregiver level, rather than at the household level. Observed handwashing behavior is reported below for each event,&#13;
         overall and by type of critical event observed. The events of interest were the same as those for self-reported handwashing&#13;
         behavior: after fecal contact, before food preparation, before eating, and before feeding a child. In particular, behavior as&#13;
         measured among primary caregivers is reported.&#13;

            Validity of rapid measures of hand washing
            behavior : an analysis of data from multiple impact
            evaluations in the global scaling up hand washing project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            There is increasing interest in
            improving hand washing in low- and middle-income countries.
            The validity of rapid hand washing measures was evaluated by
            comparing them to hand washing behavior measured during
            five-hour structured observations. Hand washing was measured
            in the impact evaluation of the global scaling up hand
            washing project, carried out by the water and sanitation
            program (WSP) in Peru, Senegal, and Vietnam. Global scaling
            up hand washing tested the effects of at-scale
            implementation of hand washing promotion on various
            outcomes, including behavior and health, in four countries,
            Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam using
            cluster-randomized controlled trial designs. Structured
            observations were carried out among a subset of households
            participating in end line surveys in each country.
            Regression was used to model the relationship between the
            rapid hand washing measure and the probability that hands
            were washed during the observed event, accounting for the
            repeated nature of structured observation data. This
            multi-country analysis of the validity of rapid hand washing
            measures confirms the utility of observing hand washing
            materials at the places where people wash hands, at the
            times most necessary for washing them (after fecal contact
            and before food preparation). The findings described
            reinforce the global imperative of improving hand washing
            behavior for prevention of the leading causes of death in
            young children.
